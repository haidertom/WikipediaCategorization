'''Alejo Carpentier y Valmont''' (December 26, 1904 – April 24, 1980) was a [[Cuba]]n novelist, essayist, and [[musicologist]] who greatly influenced [[Latin American literature]] during its famous [[Latin American Boom|"boom" period]]. Born in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, Carpentier grew up in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], and despite his European birthplace, he  strongly self-identified as Cuban throughout his life. He traveled extensively, particularly in France, and to South America and Mexico, where he met prominent members of the Latin American cultural and artistic community. Carpentier took a keen interest in Latin American politics and often aligned himself with revolutionary movements, such as [[Fidel Castro]]'s Communist Revolution in Cuba in the mid-20th century. Carpentier was jailed and exiled for his leftist political philosophies.

With a developed knowledge of music, Carpentier explored musicology, publishing an in-depth study of the [[music of Cuba]], ''La música en Cuba'' and integrated musical themes and literary techniques throughout his works. He explored elements of [[Afro-Cuban]]ism and incorporated the cultural aspects into the majority of his writings. Although Carpentier wrote in a myriad of genres, such as journalism, radio drama, playwrighting, academic essays, opera and libretto, he is best known for his novels. He was among the first practitioners of [[magical realism]] using the technique, ''lo real maravilloso'' to explore the fantastic quality of Latin American history and culture. The most famous example of Afro-Cuban influence and use of ''lo real maravilloso'' is Carpentier's 1949 novel ''[[El reino de este mundo]]'' (''[[The Kingdom of this World]]'') about the Haitian revolution of the late 18th century.

Carpentier's writing style integrated the resurgent [[Baroque]] style, or ''New World Baroque'' style that Latin American artists adopted from the European model and assimilated to the Latin American artistic vision. With a first-hand experience of the French Surrealist movement, Carpentier also adapted the [[Surrealist]] theory to Latin American literature. Always eager to explore more than Cuban identity, Carpentier used his traveling experiences throughout Europe and Latin American to expand his understanding of Latin American identity. Carpentier wove elements of Latin American political history, music, social injustice and art into the tapestries of his writings, all of which  exerted a decisive influence on the works of younger Latin American and Cuban writers like [[Lisandro Otero]], [[Leonardo Padura]] and Fernando Velázquez Medina.

Carpentier died in Paris in 1980 and was buried in Havana's [[Colon Cemetery]] with other Cuban political and artistic luminaries.

==Life==

===Early life and education===
Carpentier was born on December 26, 1904, in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, to Jorge Julián Carpentier, a French architect, and Lina Valmont, a Russian language teacher.&lt;ref name="Belnap 1993 263-264, cited in Wakefield 2004 p.5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Belnap|1993|pp= 263–264, cited in Wakefield (2004) p.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time it was believed that he was born in [[Havana]], where his family moved immediately after his birth; however, following Carpentier's death, his birth certificate was found in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Belnap|1993|pp= 263–264, cited in Wakefield (2004) p.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, Alejo and his family moved from [[Cuba]] to Paris. He also spoke French and as an adolescent, he read Balzac, Flaubert, and Zola.&lt;ref name="Belnap 1993 263-264, cited in Wakefield 2004 p.5"/&gt; In 1921, Carpentier attended the School of Architecture of the University of Havana. When he was 18, his parents' marriage broke up and his father left. The following year, Carpentier left his studies and tried to find work to support his mother.&lt;ref name="Belnap 1993 263-264, cited in Wakefield 2004 p.5"/&gt; He turned to journalism, working for the Cuban newspapers ''Carteles'' and ''Social''. He also studied music.&lt;ref name="Colchie"&gt;Colchie, Thomas (editor), ''A Hammock Beneath the Mangoes: stories from Latin America''; Penguin Group, 416–417 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuba and exile in France===

In 1921, while studying in Havana, Carpentier became a cultural journalist, writing mostly about avant-garde developments in the arts, particularly music."&lt;ref name="Bergh 1972, p.19"&gt;Bergh 1972, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed columns to ''La Discusión'', a daily journal from Havana. His journalistic work, which was considered leftist, helped establish the [[Cuban Communist Party]].&lt;ref name="Colchie"/&gt;
During 1923 and 1924 he continued to work as a columnist and also edited musical and theatre reviews for ''La Discusión'' and ''[[El Heraldo de Cuba]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bergh 1972, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, with the help of Jorge Mañach, Juan Marinello, Francisco Ichaso, and Martí Casanovas, he became a founding member of ''Revista de Avance'', a magazine devoted to nationalism, radicalism and new ideas in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Bergh 1972, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

The first issue appeared on March 15, 1927; it lasted until September 15, 1930, and became the "voice of the vanguard" and the primary voice of expression of the Cuban movement.&lt;ref name="Bergh 1972, p.19"/&gt; Because of his involvement in such projects, Carpentier was often suspected of having subversive and ultramodern cultural ideas. Carpentier was arrested in 1927 for opposing [[Gerardo Machado y Morales]] dictatorship and had signed a democratic and anti-imperialist manifesto against Machado's regime and, as a result, spent forty days in jail.&lt;ref name="Bergh 1972, p.19"/&gt; During this brief period in jail he started working on his first novel, ''Ecué-Yamba-O'', an exploration of Afro-Cuban traditions among the poor of the island.&lt;ref name="Colchie"/&gt; (The book was eventually completed in 1933.)

After his release, he escaped Cuba with the help of journalist [[Robert Desnos]] who lent him his passport and papers.&lt;ref name="Colchie"/&gt; Carpentier decided on a voluntary exile to France and arrived in Paris in 1928; he remained there until 1939, when he returned to Havana. When he left Cuba, he was fortunate enough to avoid the political conflicts which had occurred during the 1930s. During this time certain positions were unacceptable to the authorities and Cuban intellectuals were forced to define their political position and for these and other political reasons he decided to leave.

During this time abroad, his disconnection from Cuba and the interaction with different groups of intellectuals and artists in Paris helped with his ‘critical vision’.&lt;ref&gt;Bergh 1972, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier felt that it was important for him to remain outside the influences of movements because he believed in maintaining a “balance against the insularity of his homeland”.&lt;ref name="Echevarría 1990, p.34"&gt;Echevarría 1990, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arriving in Paris he immediately began working on poems and editorials in Parisian and Cuban magazines. Contributions to the Parisian Journal such as the short story "Cahiers du Sud" (1933), in French, were an effort to acquire European readers as a way to improve his recognition.&lt;ref name="Echevarría 1990, p.34"/&gt; He also contributed to the magazines ''Documents'' and ''L’Intransigeant''.&lt;ref&gt;Bergh 1972, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier was familiar with the activities of the ''Comité de Jeunes Revolutionnaires Cubains'', a group of exiled Cuban leftists who had published ''La Terreur á Cuba'', a brochure against the Machado government. He documented the latest news about this group and their activities in his book ''Homenaje a nuestros amigos de Paris''.&lt;ref&gt;Bergh 1972, p.43&lt;/ref&gt; It was also during this time that, with the help of Robert Desnos, Carpentier became part of the surrealist movement which became a positive influence in his work. While in France, Carpentier also founded a literary magazine called ''Imán'' in 1931, for which he became editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;Mocega-Gonzalez 1980, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the authors who worked with him in ''La Revolution Surrealiste'' also contributed works in ''Imán'' under the title “''Conocimiento de America''”.&lt;ref name="Janney 1981, p.69"&gt;Janney 1981, p.69&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier contributed the short story ''Histoire de Lunes'' (1933); it was experimental for its time as it contained elements of fantasy and folklore characterized as magical reality.&lt;ref name="Janney 1981, p.69"/&gt;

Surrealism helped Carpentier to see contexts and aspects, especially those of American life, which he did not see before and after working among the leading artistic figures for some time, Carpentier did not feel overly enthusiastic about his work within surrealism and had felt that his “surrealist attempts ha[d] been in vain” describing his frustration, as he felt he had “nothing to add to this movement in France".&lt;ref&gt;Bergh 1972, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

As Carpentier became acquainted with those among the arts community he had several encounters to meet other famous authors such as [[Pablo Neruda]], who had sent him a draft of his book “''Residencia el la Tierra''” to review; Guatemalan author [[Miguel Ángel Asturias]], whose work on pre-Columbian mythology influenced his writing;&lt;ref name="Colchie"/&gt;  and [[Pablo Picasso]], an introduction made possible through Carpentier's connection with friends in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Bergh 1972, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his time in France Carpentier was occupied with not only literary works, but also other projects that kept him engaged within the arts. He collaborated with French composer Marins François Gaillard on the musical ''Yamba-O'', “a burlesque tragedy”, that was presented in the ''Théâtre Beriza'' in Paris (1928); and with composer [[Amadeo Roldán]] helped organize the Cuban premieres of works by [[Stravinsky]] and [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]]. In film, Carpentier wrote text and edited music for the French documentary ''Le Vaudou''.&lt;ref&gt;Bergh 1972, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to earn his living by writing on contemporary culture, both in French and Spanish. He also began working for a French radio station as a sound-technician and producer. From 1932 until 1939 Carpentier worked on several projects produced by Foniric Studios.&lt;ref name="Echevarría 1990, p.34"/&gt; He directed the production of ''[[Le Livre de Christophe Colomb]]'' and collaborated with Desnos on arranging readings of Edgar Allan Poe's ''The Murders in the Rue Morgue'', and Walt Whitman’s ''Salute to the World''. Although abroad, Carpentier still maintained contact with Cuba by sending articles and poems to contribute to Havana publications such as ''Ensayos Convergentes''.&lt;ref name="Echevarría 1990, p.34"/&gt;

When the Machado regime came to an end in 1933, Carpentier decided to make plans to return to his native land to visit, and in 1936 he made the trip back to Cuba. The time he had spent in Paris for over eleven years had enriched and "oriented his expressive abilities".&lt;ref&gt;Bergh 1972, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier himself indicated that he was tiring of Paris, and "...in 1939 without any other reason than the nostalgia of Cuba, I vacated my apartment and started the return to La Havana".&lt;ref&gt;Bergh 1972, p.131&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Years in Haiti and Return to Cuba ===

In 1943, accompanied by French theatrical director [[Louis Jouvet]], Carpentier made a crucial trip to [[Haiti]], during which he visited the fortress of the [[Citadelle Laferrière]] and the Palace of Sans-Souci, both built by the black king [[Henri Christophe]]. This trip, along with readings from [[Oswald Spengler]]'s cyclical interpretation of history, provided the inspiration for his second novel, ''El Reino de Este Mundo'' ''([[The Kingdom of this World]])'' (1949).

Carpentier returned to Cuba and continued to work as a [[journalist]] at the outbreak of World War II. He worked on a history of [[Music of Cuba|Cuban music]], eventually published in 1946 as ''La música en Cuba''.&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier, Alejo 1972. ''La Musica en Cuba''. Mexico.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Life in Venezuela ===

In 1945, Carpentier moved to Caracas as an exile. From 1945 to 1959 he lived in [[Venezuela]], which is the inspiration for the unnamed South American country in which much of his novel ''The Lost Steps'' takes place.

He wrote short stories which were later collected in ''The War of Time'' (1958).&lt;ref name="Colchie"/&gt; While in Cuba, Carpentier attended a ''[[santería]]'' ceremony that was to further deepen his interest in Afro-Cubanism. In 1949, he finished his novel ''The Kingdom of this World''. This novel has a prologue that "outlines Carpentier's faith in the destiny of [[Latin America]] and the aesthetic implications of its peculiar cultural heritage."&lt;ref name="Colchie"/&gt;

===Later life===
Carpentier returned to Cuba after [[Fidel Castro]]'s Communist revolution in 1959. He worked for the State Publishing House while he completed the baroque-style book, ''El Siglo de las Luces'' ''([[Explosion in a Cathedral]])'' (1962).&lt;ref name="Colchie"/&gt; This novel discusses the advent of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the ideas of the [[French Revolution]] in the New World. It has twin [[leitmotifs]] of the printing press and the [[guillotine]] and can be read as a "meditation on the dangers inherent in all revolutions as they begin to confront the temptations of dictatorship."&lt;ref name="Colchie"/&gt; After reading the book, [[Gabriel García Márquez]] is said to have discarded the first draft of ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'' and begun again from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;Echevarría&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- original edit doesn't give the year - either 1990 or 1993 --&gt;

In 1966, Carpentier settled in Paris where he served as Cuban ambassador to France. In 1975 he was the recipient of the [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]]. He received the [[Premio Cervantes|Cervantes Prize]]&lt;ref name=jp&gt;{{Fr icon}}[http://www.chez.com/jpquin/carpenti.html Une autre vision de Cuba]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1977 and was recipient of the French Laureates [[Prix Médicis]] étranger in 1979 for ''La harpe et l'ombre''.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;&lt;ref name=wiki&gt;[[Prix Médicis]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lettre&gt;{{Fr icon}}[http://www.lettresdecuba.cult.cu/global/loader.php?&amp;cont=showpersona.php&amp;num=1&amp;seccion=4&amp;id=7 Lettres de Cuba, Alejo Carpentier] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071125130521/http://www.lettresdecuba.cult.cu/global/loader.php |date=2007-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpentier was struggling with cancer as he completed his final novel, ''El arpa y la sombra'', and finally died in Paris on April 24, 1980. His remains were returned to Cuba for interment in the [[Colon Cemetery, Havana]].

''[[École Française de la Havane|École Française de la Havane "Alejo Carpentier"]]'', a French international school in Havana, is named after him.

==Themes==

===Lo real maravilloso===
Carpentier is widely known for his theory of ''lo real maravilloso''. This is the notion that the history and the geography of Latin America are both so extreme as to appear fictional or even magical to outsiders. Thus, Latin America is a region where the line between magic and reality is blurred. It was in the prologue to ''The Kingdom of this World'', a novel of the [[Haitian Revolution]], that he described his vision of ''lo real maravilloso'': "But what is the history of Latin America but a chronicle of magical realism?".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gosser Esquilín|1997|}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The novel itself develops the outlandish (but true) history of [[Henri Christophe]], first king of Haiti, as an example of how the real history of Latin America is so strange as to appear fictional. Some critics interpret the ''real maravilloso'' as being synonymous with [[magical realism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|2004|}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Carpentier's theory and its development in his work are more limited in their scope than is the magical realism of, for example, Gabriel García Márquez. Whereas García Márquez's works include events that the reader never mistakes for reality (rainfall of flowers, old men with wings, etc.), Carpentier, for the most part, simply writes about extreme aspects of the history and geography of Latin America, aspects that are almost unbelievable, but that are in fact true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|2004|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
As a young child Carpentier was exposed to a great deal of music. Carpentier himself played the piano, as did his mother; his father played cello, studying under [[Pablo Casals]], and his grandmother played the organ.&lt;ref name="Navarro 1999 25"&gt;{{Harvnb|Navarro|1999|p= 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier studied music theory at the Lycée Jeanson de Sailly when he lived in Paris for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Colchie|1991|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier's own compositions made him an important part of the contemporary Cuban musical landscape, but he also studied the origins and political nuances of Cuban music. His devotion to the adaptations of European artistic styles into Latin American music styles can also be seen in his admiration for Afro-Cuban musical themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Navarro|1999|pp=16–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his career Carpentier collaborated with other young musicians eager to explore Cuban musical roots. One such collaborator was [[Amadeo Roldán]], a French musician of Cuban background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Navarro|1999|pp= 42–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; They helped to organize the Cuban premiere of popular orchestral music of the era ''Conciertos de música nueva'' (''Concerts of New Music''), featuring composers such as [[Stravinsky]], [[Milhaud]], [[Ravel]], [[Malipiero]], [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]] and [[Erik Satie]]. In regards to their own music, Carpentier and Roldán were far more interested in integrating African rhythms and melodies into their works and abandoned imitation of European musical styles. "¡Abajo la lira, arriba el bongó!"&lt;ref name="Navarro 1999 43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Navarro|1999|p= 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Down with the lyre, up with the bongo!) was the popular slogan for their style of music. Carpentier and Roldán collaborated on numerous works, including the 1925 orchestral piece ''Obertura sobre temas cubanos'' (''Overture on Cuban Themes'') which was regarded as scandalous for its betrayal of what was seen as the proper European-style symphony in favor of Afro-Cuban inspired music.&lt;ref name="Navarro 1999 43"/&gt;  Other well-known collaborations between the two included ''Tres pequeñas poemas: Oriente, Pregón, Fiesta negra'' (''Three little poems'') produced in 1926, and two Afro-Cuban ballets: ''La Rebambaramba'', a colonial ballet  in two parts (1928) and ''El milagro de Anaquille'' (1929).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1972|pp= 44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpentier's interest in music had great influence on his prose writing. Navarro suggests that readers of Carpentier's works are more listeners than they are readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Navarro|1999|p= 105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical use of colloquial dialects, literary rhythms such as alliteration and assonance and the theme of music within the world of the narrative (drums, footsteps, etc.) are a few examples of music's influence over Carpentier's work.&lt;ref name="Navarro 1999 25"/&gt; In an interview the author himself was quoted as saying "Music is present in all of my work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1983|, cited in Navarro (1999) p.156}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Carpentier, analysis of Cuban identity was grounded in the analysis of Cuban music.  As such, for Carpentier to better understand Cuban identity through his work, he eagerly integrated music into his writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Navarro|1999|p= 217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnomusicology and Afro-Cubanism===
With this intrinsic appreciation of music and a fascination with Cuban identity, Carpentier began investigating the origins of Cuban music in a more academic sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Navarro|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, Carpentier published the ethnomusicological study ''La Música en Cuba'' which explores how European music, transplanted African music and the indigenous music of the island all blended together to create Cuban music. Carpentier took particular interest in Afro-Cuban themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1972|pp= 55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly fascinated with the overwhelming influence of African music in Cuban music, Carpentier introduced Afro-Cuban influenced music called ''lo afrocubano'', (i.e. heavily improvised and rhythm based music) into what was deemed more formal music venues dependent on European styles, called ''lo guajiro''. Carpentier once wrote that ''lo guajiro'' was, "very poetic, but ''lo guajiro'' is not music...On the other hand, in mestizo and black music...the rich material has an incredible wealth to it...to make it the work of national expression."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1972|pp= 360–362, cited in Navarro (1999) p.39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of racial tensions between white Cubans and black and [[criollo people|criollo]] Cubans, such preferences were not well received by the Cuban elite of the mid century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1972|pp= 293–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier devoted the majority of his musicology research to the [[Afro-Cuban]] influences present in Cuba. For example, Carpentier paid particular attention to [[Contradanza]], a wildly popular Cuban dance derived from the European style of music and dance, [[Country dance|Contredanse]]. The ample room left for musical improvisation and the element of group dance were easily adapted into African musical tradition where improvisation and dance play integral roles. Hence, a hybrid musical form unique to Cuba was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1972|p= 126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier argued that the improvisation inherent in African influenced music allowed for varied interpretations that catalyzed regional differences and therefore regional identity, and concluded that this was why Cuba had such a varied musical identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1972|p= 249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''El reino de este mundo'' (The Kingdom of this World)===
Carpentier's ''[[El reino de este mundo]]'' (1949) highlights the [[Haitian Revolution]] of the 18th century when the African slaves fought the French colonists for their freedom and basic human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Paravisini-Gebert|2004|p= 114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel combines not only historical references of the event with aspects of African faith and rituals, most notably [[Haitian vodou]]; but also the connections between corporeal and spiritual self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Paravisini-Gebert|2004|pp= 115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story is seen through the eyes of the protagonist Ti Noël, a black slave. Being a white, European/Cuban writer who published on the subject of the Haitian Revolution, it has been implied that Carpentier chose to write from Ti Noël's point of view so that he would avoid being criticized for any racial stereotyping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wakefield|2004|p= 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier incorporates symbolic architecture throughout the novel; representing the dictatorship of colonial rule with structures such as the [[Sans-Souci Palace]] and the fortress of La Ferrière.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wakefield|2004|p= 56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''La música en Cuba'' (The Music of Cuba)===

''La música en Cuba'' (''The Music of Cuba'') is an ethno-musicological study of the [[Music of Cuba]] starting from the sixteenth century with the arrival of European explorers, until the present day of publication, the mid-twentieth century. The blending of different cultures&amp;mdash;black, white, mulattoes, [[criollo people|criollos]] and natives&amp;mdash;mirrors the blending of Cuba’s two main musical styles, the Christian European music and the elemental percussion and rhythm-based music of the transported Africans and aboriginal peoples of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1972|p= 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book includes a general history of music in colonized Latin America but mainly focuses on Cuban styles of music and dance, influential Cuban musicians and Cuban musical identity. Carpentier devotes a great deal of his study to exploring the influence African descendants had on Cuban music. He has an entire chapter titled, “Los Negros” ("The Blacks")&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1972|p= 136}}&lt;/ref&gt; that explores the many substantial ways African music influenced all of Latin American music. According to Carpentier, the African influence on Cuban music in particular was deliberately concealed by the colonist prejudice of 18th and 19th century Cuba. At the time of the book's publication many white Cubans were reluctant to even acknowledge the blending of the cultures much less investigate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1972|pp= 302–303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier, though, was eager to do so and by making bold statements about Cuba’s past and integral relationships with a wide range of cultures he succeeded in giving back to Cuba an in-depth academic perspective of its own cultural identity through its music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1972|p= 304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Guerra del tiempo'' (The War of Time)===

''Guerra del tiempo'' (''The War of Time'') is a set of surrealistic short-stories, in a variety of styles, which evidences Carpentier's ability to work with the fantastic and the surreal. The most important is the first one, "El Camino de Santiago" (The Way of Santiago), which narrates the adventures of a commoner, a Spaniard in the Age of Discovery, who is today a soldier, tomorrow pilgrim, then a sailor, a colonizer, prisoner, and so on; he pursues every dream and suffers every disappointment. The second tale is called "Viaje a la semilla" (Journey Back to the Source). This narrative is striking for the function of the time inversion that the narrator operates to tell the life of the main character, Don Marcial (Marqués de Capellanías).

=== ''El Acoso'' (''The Chase'') ===
Carpentier's masterpiece, ''El Acoso'', was originally published in Spanish in 1956 by ,  and translated into American English by Alfred Mac Adam as ''The Chase'' and published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in 1989,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Chase|last=Carpentier|first=Alejo|publisher=New York: Farrar, Straus, Giroux|year=1989|isbn=|location=|publication-date=1989|pages=|translator-last=Mac Adam|translator-first=Alfred}}&lt;/ref&gt; after over three decades of suppression in the United States for Carpentier's affiliation with Fidel Castro's Cuba&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Chase|last=Fuentes|first=Carlos|last2=Carpentier|publisher=Farrar, Straus, Giroux|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=back cover}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Carpentier had been Cuba's ambassador to France during this time).  The novel is one of the most influential novels in contemporary Latin American literature, cited by authors such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Mario Vargas Llosa, Jose Donoso and others as a major influence in the movement known in North America as Latin American Magical Realism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The novel is highly compressed, richly atmospheric, philosophical, stylistically brilliant, and non-linear; plot is treated almost as an inconsequential side-effect.  Though short (121 pages in English), the novel exhibits a certain labyrinthine quality as its fragmented narrative cycles and circles in upon itself. Ostensibly a man is being chased by somewhat shadowy, probably sinister, perhaps governmental, forces.  The action starts on a rainy night at a symphonic concert and music plays a part in the clues necessary to piece together what is happening.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  ''The Chase'' is perhaps Carpentier's strongest novel, and easily one of the better novels written in the 20th century, though it is almost unknown in the English-speaking world in spite of Mac Adam's superb 1989 translation.

==Style==

===Baroque===
The [[Baroque]] style dates back to the cultural period of the 17th and early 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wakefield|2004|p= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most often defined as "the dominant style of art in Europe between the [[Mannerist]] and [[Rococo]] eras, a style characterized by dynamic movement, overt emotion and self-confident rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Piper|1984|pp= 44–45, cited in Wakefield (2004) p.3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier first became fascinated with this style in architecture and sculpture; however, he later describes ''el barroco'' as ''un espíritu'', and not ''un estilo histórico'' ("a spirit, not an historical style").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1990|p= 175, cited in Wakefield (2004) p.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wakefield insists that this attitude towards the Baroque stemmed from Carpentier's background in both Europe and Latin America which allowed him to take on a superior front in the face of post-colonialism and ultimately have the literary upper-hand where he could use European style to tell the Latin American story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wakefield|2004|p= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier developed his vision of the baroque in his early works before he described himself as a baroque writer. He experimented with the technique in several developmental stages: "first as a cultural style of aesthetic fascination, later as a literary device to create period ambiance, and finally as a weapon of postcolonial pride, defiance and one-upmanship".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wakefield|2004|p= 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This style strongly presents itself when comparing works such as the early ''Ecue-Yamba-O'' to the celebrated ''El reino de este mundo'', regarding Carpentier's use of more historically eloquent vocabulary in the latter, instead of the authentic language of the ethnically-inspired characters. Here he escapes the stereotype of "nativism" by incorporating European standards, but continues to achieve a sense of normalcy without the expected use of the colloquialisms which the protagonist Ti Noel would undoubtedly use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wakefield|2004|p= 49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaup claims that Carpentier utilizes what is known as the "New World Baroque", since Latin America didn't come into contact with the Enlightenment or "European modernity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaup|2005|p= 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ''contraconquista'' (counter conquest) allows the New World authors to experiment with new identities and the manners of expressing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaup|2005|pp= 110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Carpentier observed in his 1975 essay that "American Baroque develop[ed] along with ''criollo'' culture ...: the awareness of being Other, of being new, of being symbiotic, of being a ''criollo''; and the ''criollo'' spirit is itself a Baroque spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpentier|1975|p= 100, cited in Kaup (2005) p.110}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ''criollo'' of the New World Baroque is often seen as the dominant style of European literature emerging as a subordinate literary construction in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaup|2005|p= 116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence of travel===
Wakefield notes that Carpentier's diverse travels were motivated by his need to incorporate the sights he experienced into familiar descriptions within his novels. Carpentier's ''El reino de este mundo'' was inspired by his 1943 trip to Haiti, and ''Los pasos perdidos'' drew on his visit to Venezuela in 1949. Similarly, his travels to Guadeloupe and the Gulf of Sante Fe inspired ''El siglo de las luces'', and Vera and Enrique's firsthand descriptions of Baku and Mexico in ''La consegración de la primavera'' were drawn from Carpentier's trips to those places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wakefield|2004|p= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surrealism===
During his visit to France early in his life, Carpentier met and collaborated with many figures of the French [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] movement. Taken with Surrealist theory, Carpentier absorbed much of it from his contemporaries, mainly his friend and colleague, the Parisian journalist [[Robert Desnos]]. Striving to portray unlikely beauty, termed, "the third beauty", Surrealist theory embraced unique perspectives of the world.&lt;ref name="Navarro 1999 62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Navarro|1999|p= 62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Surrealist theory was the concept of [[Primitivism]] or a reverence for presiding folkloric tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leante|1970|pp= 21–22, cited in Navarro (1999) p.67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpentier, inspired by French Surrealists, learned to view his Cuban home in this new light. He left France with a bursting sense of Cuban and Latin American pride and the artistic goal to capture what it meant to be both.&lt;ref name="Navarro 1999 62"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9201">'''Arthur Versluis''' (born 1959) is a professor and Department Chair of Religious Studies in the College of Arts &amp; Letters at Michigan State University.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.religiousstudies.msu.edu/index.php/faculty/ Michigan State University, Religious Studues Faculty]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://arthurversluis.com/?page_id=29 arthurversluis.com, ''About'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Versluis did his Ph.D research at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. His thesis ''Ex oriente lux: American Transcendentalism and the Orient'' (1990)&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/104316 Arthur Versluis, ''''Ex oriente lux'']&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1993 as ''American Transcendentalism and Asian Religions''.&lt;ref group=web name="MSU"&gt;[http://www.religiousstudies.msu.edu/index.php/faculty/arthur-versluis/ Michigan State University, ''Arthus Versluis'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research topics==
Versluis' research focuses on [[western esotericism]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], with a special interest in the influence of [[Platonism]] on western mysticism and American [[Transcendentalism]].&lt;ref group=web name="AV-7Q"&gt;[https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/sacredmatters/2015/01/12/seven-questions-for-arthur-versluis/ ''American Gurus: Seven Questions for Arthur Versluis''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417164207/https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/sacredmatters/2015/01/12/seven-questions-for-arthur-versluis/ |date=April 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcendentalism and American esotericism===
{{See also|Neo-Advaita|Subitism}}

Versluis has published a "trilogy" on American Transcendentalism and the development of western esotericism, namely ''American Transcendentalism and Asian Religions'' (1993), ''The Esoteric Origins of the American Renaissance'' (2001), and ''American Gurus: From Transcendentalism to New Age Religion'' (2014). In these publications, he describes the development of American Transcendentalism and its influence on western esotericism, including the contemporary phenomenon of "immediatist gurus", who promise instant enlightenment.&lt;ref group=web name="AV-7Q" /&gt;

In ''American Transcendentalism and Asian Religions'', Versluis describes the influence of Asian religions on European Romanticism and on American Transcendentalism.{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p=3}} In the early 19th century, these Asian religions were introduced to the western culture, and texts like the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and the [[Upanishads]] had a great impact on the Transcendental movement, and influential members like [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] and [[Thoreau]].{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p=3}} But Transcendentalism was also influenced by [[western esotericism]], a topic which until recently received little attention in the academia.{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p=3}}{{refn|group=note|See also Elizabeth De Michelis (2005), ''A History of Modern Yoga'', for this neglected influence on the development of a global spirituality.}}

In ''The Esoteric Origins of the American Renaissance'' Versluis investigates the influence of western esotericism on the mid-19th [[American Renaissance]]. Versluis regards his ''The Esoteric Origins'' as a pioneering study in this discipline.{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p=3}}

In ''American Gurus: From Transcendentalism to New Age Religion'', Versluis describes the emergence of immediatist gurus: gurus who are not connected to any of the traditional religions, and promise instant enlightenment and liberation.{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=1,2}} These include [[Eckhart Tolle]], [[Ram Dass]], [[Adi Da]], and [[Andrew Cohen (spiritual teacher)|Andrew Cohen]].{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=1}} "Immediatism" refers to "a religious assertion of spontaneous, direct, unmediated spiritual insight into reality (typically with little or no prior training), which some term [[Enlightenment (spirituality)|"enlightenment"]]."{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=2}} According to Versluis, immediatism is typical for Americans, who want "the fruit of religion, but not its obligations."&lt;ref group=web name="AV-7Q" /&gt; Although immediatism has its roots in European culture and history{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=2}} as far back as [[Platonism]],{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=3}} and also includes [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]],{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=4}} Versluis points to [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] as its key ancestor,{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=2}} who "emphasized the possibility of immediate, direct spiritual knowledge and power."{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=3}}

===Christian Theosophy===
Another "trilogy" deals with [[Christian theosophy]], and includes ''Theosophia'' (1994), ''Wisdom’s Children: A Christian Esoteric Tradition'' (1999), and ''Wisdom’s Book: The Sophia Anthology'' (2000).&lt;ref group=web name="MSU" /&gt;

==Journals and associations==
Versluis is an editor of the ''Journal for the Study of Radicalism'', and founding editor of ''Esoterica'', which started as a journal, and is now a biannual print book series, ''Studies in Esotericism''.&lt;ref group=web name="MSU" /&gt; Versluis is also the founding president of the ''Association for the Study of Esotericism''.&lt;ref group=web name="MSU" /&gt;

The '''Arts and Humanities Research Council''' ('''AHRC''') was established in April 2005 as successor to the Arts and Humanities Research Board and is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[UK Research Councils|Research Council]]; [[non-departmental public body]] that provides approximately £102 million from the [[UK government|government]]  to support [[research]] and postgraduate study in the [[arts]] and [[humanities]], from languages and law, archaeology and English literature to design and creative and performing arts. In any one year, the AHRC makes approximately 700 research awards and around 1,350 postgraduate awards. Awards are made after a rigorous peer review process, to ensure that only applications of the highest quality are funded.

==Recently funded research==

===Stonehenge Riverside Project===

The [[Stonehenge Riverside Project]] is a major five year AHRC-funded archaeological research study interested in the development of the [[Stonehenge]] landscape in Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain. In particular, the project is interested in the relationship between the stones and surrounding monuments and features including; The River Avon, Durrington Walls, the Cursus, the Avenue, Woodhenge, burial mounds, and nearby standing stones. In August 2009 the project discovered a new stone circle, which was named [[Bluestonehenge]] by the research team, about one mile away from [[Stonehenge]] in [[Wiltshire]], England. The project is run by a consortium of university teams.  It is directed by Prof. Mike Parker Pearson of Sheffield University, with co-directors Dr Josh Pollard (University of Southampton), Prof. Julian Thomas (Manchester University), Dr Kate Welham (Bournemouth University) and Dr Colin Richards (Manchester University).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shef.ac.uk/mediacentre/2009/1363.html |title=News releases 2009 |work=shef.ac.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Soldier Database===

Researchers at the University of Reading and University of Southampton analysed historic sources such as muster rolls records in the National Archives at Kew and the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris (for records of English garrisons in France). The resulting Medieval Soldier online database enables people to search for soldiers by surname, rank or year of service.  The online database contains 250,000 service records of soldiers who saw active duty in the latter phases of the Hundred Years' War (1369–1453).

===Old Bailey Proceedings Archive===

An AHRC research grant enabled academics from the [[University of Hertfordshire]], [[University of Sheffield]] and the [[Open University]] to double in size the [[Old Bailey]] trial proceedings available to view on the Old Bailey Proceedings Online website and provide access to the largest single source of searchable information about ordinary British lives and behaviour ever published.

The Old Bailey Proceedings Online makes available a fully searchable, digitised collection of all surviving editions of the Old Bailey Proceedings from 1674 to 1913, and of the [[Ordinary (officer)|Ordinary]] of [[Newgate Prison|Newgate]]'s Accounts, 1679 to 1772. It allows access to over 197,000 trials and biographical details of approximately 2,500 men and women executed at [[Tyburn]].

==History==

In 2005 the AHRC replaced the Arts and Humanities Research Board (AHRB), founded in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Creating the AHRC: An Arts and Humanities Research Council for the United Kingdom in the Twenty-first Century (Oxford UP, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The AHRC publish reviews and reports on arts and humanities subjects, as well as corporate publications. Research news and findings are communicated in website features, press releases, and multimedia content such as podcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/News-and-Events/Publications/Pages/Publications.aspx |title=Publications - Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council |publisher=Ahrc.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2005 and 2010, the AHRC published a magazine called ''Podium'' twice a year, which contained news and case studies based on research that they have funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/News-and-Events/Publications/Publications-archive/Pages/Publications-archive.aspx/ |title=Publications archive - Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council |publisher=Ahrc.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

The AHRC is one of seven [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils]] in the UK.

Professor Andrew S Thompson is serving as Interim Chief Executive of the AHRC, from December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/appointment-of-interim-chief-executive-for-the-arts-and-humanities-research-council&lt;/ref&gt; The previous CE of the AHRC was Professor Rick Rylance who took up the post on 1 September 2009, and was re-appointed in September 2013 to serve until August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/News-and-Events/News/Pages/Reappointment-of-Chief-Executive-for-the-AHRC.aspx |title=Reappointment of Chief Executive for the AHRC - Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council |publisher=Ahrc.ac.uk |date=2013-09-01 |accessdate=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cuculus canorus 1873.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Common cuckoo|cuckoo]]'s well-known call is used in music by [[Beethoven]], [[Frederick Delius|Delius]], [[Handel]], [[Respighi]], [[Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Saint-Saens]], and [[Vivaldi]]. Engraving by [[John Gerrard Keulemans]], 1873]]

'''Birds''' have played a role in Western Classical '''music''' since at least the 14th century, when composers such as [[Jean Vaillant]] quoted [[birdsong]] in some of their compositions. Among the birds whose song is most often used in music are the [[nightingale]] and the [[Common cuckoo|cuckoo]].

Composers and musicians have made use of birds in their music in different ways: they can be inspired by birdsong; they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition; they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works, as [[Ottorino Respighi]] first did; or, like the cellist [[Beatrice Harrison]] in 1924 and more recently the [[jazz]] musician [[David Rothenberg]], they can duet with birds.

Authors including Rothenberg have claimed that birds such as the [[hermit thrush]]&lt;!--see body of article--&gt; sing on traditional scales as used in human music, but at least one songbird, the [[nightingale wren]], does not choose notes in this way. However, among birds which habitually borrow phrases or sounds from other species such as the [[European starling|starling]], the way they use variations of rhythm, relationships of [[musical pitch]], and combinations of [[musical note|note]]s can resemble music. The similar motor constraints on human and avian song may have driven these to have similar song structures, including "arch-shaped and descending melodic contours in musical phrases", long notes at the ends of phrases, and typically small differences in pitch between adjacent notes, at least in birds with a strong song structure like the [[Certhia familiaris|Eurasian treecreeper]].&lt;ref name=Tierney2011&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tierney |first=Adam T. |last2=Russo |first2=Frank A. |last3=Patel |first3=Aniruddh D. |date=September 2011 |title=The motor origins of human and avian song structure |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/37/15510|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=108 |issue=37 |pages=15510–15515 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1103882108 |pmid=21876156 |pmc=3174665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on music==
{{further information|Zoomusicology}}

[[Musicologists]] such as Matthew Head and Suzannah Clark believe that [[birdsong]] has had a large though admittedly unquantifiable influence on the development of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Matthew Head |title=Birdsong and the Origins of Music |journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association |volume=122 |issue=1 |year=1997 |pages=1–23 |doi=10.1093/jrma/122.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clark, Suzannah |year=2001 |title=Music Theory and Natural Order from the Renaissance to the Early Twentieth Century |journal=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-77191-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birdsong has influenced composers in several ways: they can be inspired by birdsong; they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition; they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works; or they can duet with birds.

===Imitations of birdsong===

====Bird models====
In classical music, two especially popular birds are the [[nightingale]] and the [[Common cuckoo|cuckoo]].&lt;ref name=CampbellLack2011/&gt;

The nightingale's song has been used by composers including [[Handel]], who quoted it in the aria "Sweet bird" in ''[[L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato]]'', in the "Nightingale chorus" in ''[[Solomon (Handel)|Solomon]]'', and in his Organ Concerto "No. 13", known as "The Cuckoo and the Nightingale". It appears in Rameau's opera ''Hippolyte'', [[Respighi]]'s ''The Birds'' and [[Beethoven]]'s ''[[Third Symphony (Beethoven)|Third Symphony]]''. Nightingales can also be found in works by [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]], [[Mendelssohn]], [[Liszt]], [[Mily Balakirev|Balakirev]], [[Grieg]], [[Enrique Granados|Granados]], [[Ravel]], and [[Milhaud]].&lt;ref name=CampbellLack2011/&gt;

The cuckoo's distinctive call is used by [[Beethoven]] (''[[Pastoral Symphony]]'', 2nd movement), [[Frederick Delius|Delius]] (''[[On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring]]''), [[Handel]] (''The Cuckoo and the Nightingale''), Respighi (''The Birds''), [[Rimsky-Korsakov]] (''Snow Maidens''), [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]], [[Saint-Saens]] (''[[Carnival of the Animals]]''), [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] (''Concerto in A'', The Cuckoo), and [[Gustav Mahler]] (''First Symphony'', where the cuckoo sings [[perfect fourth]]s instead of the usual [[major third]] or [[minor third]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sward |first1=Jeffrey |title=Cuckoo and Other Bird Sounds Used in Classical Music |url=http://www.jeffreysward.com/editorials/cuckoo.htm |accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less commonly imitated are the [[great tit]] ([[Anton Bruckner]]'s ''Fourth Symphony''), the [[European goldfinch|goldfinch]] (Vivaldi), [[linnet]] ([[Couperin]], [[Haydn]] and [[Rachmaninov]]), [[European robin|robin]] ([[Peter Warlock]]), [[swallow]] (Dvorak and [[Tchaikovsky]]), [[wagtail]] ([[Benjamin Britten]]), and [[magpie]] (in a [[Mussorgsky]] song). Dvorak celebrated many other kinds of bird, including the [[stock dove]], [[skylark]], and [[house sparrow]].&lt;ref name=CampbellLack2011/&gt;

The imitation of bird song was popular in stage performances in the United States, particularly during the era when [[vaudeville]] and [[Chautauqua]] were popular.

Composers have a variety of bird sounds to work with, from actual birdsong and calls to the appearance and movements of birds, whether real, fictional (like the [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]) or indeed mechanical. They can choose to use these materials literally, imitating their sounds, as when [[Sergei Prokofiev]] uses an [[oboe]] for the quacking of a [[duck]] in ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]''; it may represent the birds symbolically; or it may give a general impression, as when Vivaldi paints a picture of birds moving and singing in ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|The Four Seasons]]''.&lt;ref name=CampbellLack2011&gt;{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=Bruce |last2=Lack |first2=Elizabeth |title=A Dictionary of Birds |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-itJV2-nLeYC&amp;pg=PA369 |year=2011 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=978-1-4081-3840-3 |pages=369–372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of a composition that imitates birdsong is the "realistic" cuckoo in [[Janequin]]'s 16th century ''Le Chant Des Oiseaux''.&lt;ref name=CampbellLack2011/&gt;

====In modern classical music====

Among twentieth-century composers, [[Olivier Messiaen]] used birdsong extensively. His ''[[Catalogue d'oiseaux]]'' is a seven-book set of solo piano pieces based on birdsong. His orchestral piece ''Réveil des Oiseaux'' is composed almost entirely of birdsong. Many of his other compositions, including ''[[Quatuor pour la fin du temps]]'', similarly integrate birdsong.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, A Technique for the End of Time (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Béla Bartók]] likewise made extensive use of North American birdsong in his [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Bartók)|Piano Concerto No. 3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harley |first1=Maria Anna |title=Birds in Concert: North American Birdsong in Bartók's Piano Concerto No. 3 |journal=Tempo|date=June 1994 |volume=189 |pages=8–16 |jstor=945149}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Nielsen]] used representations of bird calls in ''Song of the [[Siskin]]'', a rarely imitated bird, ''The First Lark'', and ''Springtime on Fyn'', though much of the effect of birds on his work appears in his orchestral colours and time-patterns.&lt;ref name=CampbellLack2011/&gt; [[Jean Sibelius]] claimed that the [[crane (bird)|crane]]'s call was the "[[leitmotiv]] of my life": it is imitated by clarinets in "Scene with Cranes" in his incidental music from Kuolema.&lt;ref name=CampbellLack2011/&gt; Sibelius's ''[[Swan of Tuonela]]'' has a sad melody on the [[cor anglais]].&lt;ref name=CampbellLack2011/&gt; The music critic Rebecca Franks, listing six of the best pieces inspired by birdsong, praises [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]'s 1914 ''[[The Lark Ascending]]'', which begins with "A silvery solo violin line flutters and darts, reaching up ever higher above the orchestra's hushed, held chord.

===Use of recorded birdsong===

The Italian composer [[Ottorino Respighi]], with his ''[[Pini di Roma|The Pines of Rome]]'' (1923–1924), may have been the first to compose a piece of music that calls for pre-recorded birdsong. A few years later, Respighi wrote [[The Birds (Respighi)|''Gli Uccelli'' ("The Birds")]], based on [[Baroque]] pieces imitating four different birds, one to each movement of the work after its prelude:&lt;ref name=Beard&gt;{{cite news |author=Beard, Harry Beard |title=Ottorino Respighi (obituary) |work=The Musical Times |date=June 1936 |volume=77 |issue=1120 |pages=555–556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, the Finnish composer [[Einojuhani Rautavaara]] wrote the orchestral piece ''[[Cantus Arcticus]]'' (Opus 61, dubbed ''Concerto for Birds and Orchestra''). It makes extensive use of recorded birdsong and bird calls from the [[Arctic]], such as the trumpeting of migrating [[swan]]s.&lt;ref name="AllMusic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/cantus-arcticus-concerto-for-birds-orchestra-for-orchestra-taped-bird-songs-op-61-mc0002372291 |accessdate=24 April 2016 |title=Cantus Arcticus (Concerto for Birds &amp; Orchestra) |website=AllMusic |first=Chris |last=Morrison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, rock bands started to use [[sound effects]] including birdsong in their albums. The English band [[Pink Floyd]] included bird sound effects in songs from their 1969 albums ''[[More (soundtrack)|More]]'' and ''[[Ummagumma]]'' (for example, "[[Grantchester Meadows (song)|Grantchester Meadows]]"). Similarly, the English singer [[Kate Bush]] used bird calls on her 2005 album, ''[[Aerial (album)|Aerial]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Petridis |first1=Alexis |title=Kate Bush, Aerial |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/nov/04/popandrock.shopping |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson2014"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson|first=William Forde |title=Music in the Social and Behavioral Sciences: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qfcOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA801 |year=2014 |publisher=Sage |isbn=978-1-4522-8302-9 |pages=801–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French composer [[François-Bernard Mâche]] has been credited with the creation of [[zoomusicology]], the study of the music of animals. His 1983 essay "Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion" includes a study of "ornitho-musicology", in which he speaks of "animal musics" and a longing to connect with nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=François-Bernard Mâche |author=Mâche, François-Bernard |title=Music, Myth and Nature, or The Dolphins of Arion'' (''Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion |publisher=Routledge |origyear=1983 |date=1993 |isbn=978-3-718-65322-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pied Butcherbird.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[pied butcherbird]] has an elaborate song with musical qualities.&lt;ref name=JMRO/&gt;]]

Luis Felipe Baptista and Robin A. Keister argued in a 2005 paper "Why Birdsong is Sometimes Like Music" that the way birds use variations of rhythm, relationships of [[musical pitch]], and combinations of [[musical note|note]]s can resemble music. They consider the theory that birds sometimes exploit variation in song to avoid monotony. They survey bird families that habitually borrow phrases or sounds from other species; the [[European starling]] is a well-studied borrower, and it is possible that the species inspired a [[Mozart]] piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baptista |first1=Luis Felipe |last2=Keister |first2=Robin A. |title=Why Birdsong is Sometimes Like Music |journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine |date=2005 |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=426–443 |doi=10.1353/pbm.2005.0066 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/185549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Tierney and colleagues argued in a 2011 paper that the similar motor constraints on human and avian song drive these to have similar song structures, including "arch-shaped and descending melodic contours in musical phrases", long notes at the ends of phrases, and typically small differences in pitch between adjacent notes. They excluded birds like the European starling which use many buzzing or clicking noises that are inharmonic, working instead with birds with a strong pitch structure like the field sparrow ''[[Spizella pusilla]]'' ([[Emberizidae]]), the Eurasian treecreeper ''[[Certhia familiaris]]'' ([[Certhiidae]]) and the summer tanager, ''[[Piranga rubra]]'' ([[Thraupidae]]).&lt;ref name=Tierney2011/&gt;

Hollis Taylor argued in her 2017 book that the vocalizations of the [[pied butcherbird]] are music, rebutting [[musicology|musicological]] objections to this in detail. This was accompanied by birdsong-based "(re)compositions" based on avian transcriptions, paired with field recordings from the Australian outback.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.realtime.org.au/is-birdsong-music-ask-the-butcherbird/ |title=Is birdsong music?

The '''bouba/kiki effect''' is a non-arbitrary mapping between speech sounds and the visual shape of objects. This effect was first observed by German-American psychologist [[Wolfgang Köhler]] in 1929.&lt;ref name = Kohler1929&gt;{{cite book | author = Köhler, W | year = 1929 | title = Gestalt Psychology. | location = New York | publisher = Liveright}}&lt;/ref&gt; In psychological experiments first conducted on the island of [[Tenerife]] (where the primary language is [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), Köhler showed forms similar to those shown at the right and asked participants which shape was called "takete" and which was called "baluba" ("maluma" in the 1947 version). Although not explicitly stated, Köhler implies that there was a strong preference to pair the jagged shape with "takete" and the rounded shape with "baluba".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Köhler, W | year = 1947 | title = Gestalt Psychology | edition = 2nd | location = New York | publisher = Liveright | page = 224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]] and Edward Hubbard repeated Köhler's experiment using the words "kiki" and "bouba" and asked American college undergraduates and Tamil speakers in India "Which of these shapes is bouba and which is kiki?" In both groups, 95% to 98% selected the curvy shape as "bouba" and the jagged one as "kiki", suggesting that the human brain somehow attaches abstract meanings to the shapes and sounds in a consistent way.&lt;ref name = "Rama2001"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ramachandran, VS | author2 = Hubbard, EM | last-author-amp = yes | year = 2001b | title = Synaesthesia: A window into perception, thought and language | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 8 | issue = 12 | pages = 3–34 | url = http://cbc.ucsd.edu/pdf/Synaesthesia%20-%20JCS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Work by [[Daphne Maurer]] and colleagues shows that even children as young as 2{{frac|1|2}} years old may show this effect as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maurer D, Pathman T, Mondloch CJ | last-author-amp = yes | year = 2006 | title = The shape of boubas: Sound-shape correspondences in toddlers and adults | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 316–322 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00495.x | pmid = 16669803 | url = http://psych.mcmaster.ca/maurerlab/Publications/Maurer_bouba.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110723035944/http://psych.mcmaster.ca/maurerlab/Publications/Maurer_bouba.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect does not occur in all communities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=S.K.|last2=Ross|first2=A.S.|date=1975|title=A cross-cultural test of the maluma-takete phenomenon|url=|journal=Perception|volume=4|pages=105–106|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it appears that the effect breaks if the sounds do not make licit words in the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Syles|first=Suzy|last2=Gawne|first2=Lauren|date=2017|title=When Does Maluma/Takete Fail?

The effect has also been shown to emerge when the words to be paired are existing first names, suggesting that some familiarity with the linguistic stimuli does not eliminate the effect. A study showed that individuals will pair names such as "Molly" with round silhouettes, and names such as "Kate" with sharp silhouettes. Moreover, individuals will associate different personality traits with either group of names (''e.g.'', easygoingness with "round names"; determination with "sharp names"). This may hint at a role of abstract concepts in the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sidhu|first=David M.|last2=Pexman|first2=Penny M.|date=2015-05-27|title=What’s in a Name?

Ramachandran and Hubbard suggest that the kiki/bouba effect has implications for the evolution of language, because it suggests that the naming of objects is not completely arbitrary.&lt;ref name = "Rama2001" /&gt;{{rp|17}} The rounded shape may most commonly be named "bouba" because the mouth makes a more rounded shape to produce that sound while a more taut, angular mouth shape is needed to make the sound "kiki".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D’Onofrio|first1=Annette|title=Phonetic Detail and Dimensionality in Sound-shape Correspondences: Refining the ''Bouba-Kiki'' Paradigm|journal=Language and Speech|date=15 November 2013|volume=57|issue=3|pages=367–393|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1020.1352&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the distinction may be between [[Coronal consonant|coronal]] or [[Dorsal consonant|dorsal]] consonants like [[Voiceless velar stop|/k/]] and [[Labial consonant|labial]] consonants like [[Voiced bilabial stop|/b/]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Additionally, it was shown that it is not only different consonants (e.g., voiceless versus voiced) and different vowel qualities (e.g., /a/ versus /i/) that play a role in the effect, but also vowel quantity (long versus short vowels). In one study, participants rated words containing long vowels to refer to longer objects and short vowels to short objects.&lt;ref&gt;Bross, F. (2018). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323749384_Cognitive_associations_between_vowel_length_and_object_size_A_new_feature_contributing_to_a_boubakiki_effect Cognitive associations between vowel length and object size: A new feature contributing to a bouba/kiki effect].

Berlin: Humbold University, 17-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of these "[[synesthesia]]-like mappings" suggest that this effect might be the neurological basis for [[sound symbolism]], in which sounds are non-arbitrarily mapped to objects and events in the world.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

More recently, research indicated that the effect may be a case of [[ideasthesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Gómez Milán, E., Iborra, O., de Córdoba, M.J., Juárez-Ramos V., Rodríguez Artacho, M.A., Rubio, J.L. (2013) The Kiki-Bouba effect: A case of personification and ideaesthesia. ''The Journal of Consciousness Studies.''  20(1-2): pp. 84-102.&lt;/ref&gt; Ideasthesia (alternative spelling ideaesthesia) is defined as a phenomenon in which activations of concepts (inducers) evoke perception-like experiences (concurrents). The name comes from the Greek ''idea'' and ''aisthesis'', meaning "sensing concepts" or "sensing ideas", and was introduced by Danko Nikolić.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nikolić|first1=Danko|title=Is synaesthesia actually ideaestesia? An inquiry into the nature of the phenomenon|journal=Proceedings of the Third International Congress on Synaesthesia, Science &amp; Art|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Autism|Autistic]] individuals do not show as strong a preference. Individuals without autism agree with the standard result 88% of the time, while individuals with autism agree only 56% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oberman LM, Ramachandran VS | last-author-amp = yes | year = 2008 | title = Preliminary evidence for deficits in multisensory integration in autism spectrum disorders: the mirror neuron hypothesis | journal = Social Neuroscience |volume = 3 | issue = 3-4 | pages = 348–55 | pmid = 18979385 | doi = 10.1080/17470910701563681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computational humor''' is a branch of [[computational linguistics]] and [[artificial intelligence]] which uses [[computer]]s in [[humor research]]. It is a relatively new area, with the first dedicated conference organized in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Hulstijn, J, and Nijholt, A. (eds.). Proceedings of the International Workshop on Computational Humor. Number 12 in Twente Workshops on Language Technology, Enschede, Netherlands. University of Twente, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first "computer model of a sense of humor" was suggested by
Suslov as early as 1992.&lt;ref&gt;I.M.Suslov, Computer Model of "a Sense of Humour". I. General Algorithm. Biofizika SSSR 37, 318 (1992) [Biophysics 37, 242 (1992)]; https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.2058.&lt;/ref&gt; Investigation of the general scheme of information processing shows the possibility of a specific malfunction, conditioned by the necessity of a quick deletion from consciousness of a false version. This specific malfunction can be identified with a humorous effect on psychological grounds: it exactly corresponds to incongruity-resolution theory. However, an essentially new ingredient, the role of timing, is added to the well-known role of ambiguity. In biological systems, a sense of humor inevitably develops in the course of evolution, because its biological function consists of quickening the transmission of the processed information into consciousness and in a more effective use of brain resources. A realization of this algorithm in neural networks&lt;ref&gt;I.M.Suslov, Computer Model of "a Sense of Humour". II. Realization in Neural Networks. Biofizika SSSR 37, 325 (1992) [Biophysics {\bf 37}, 249 (1992)] https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.2061.&lt;/ref&gt; justifies naturally Spencer's hypothesis on the mechanism of laughter: deletion of a false version corresponds to zeroing of some part of the neural network and excessive energy of neurons is thrown out to the motor cortex, arousing muscular contractions.

A practical realization of this algorithm needs extensive databases, whose creation in the automatic regime was suggested recently.&lt;ref&gt;I.M.Suslov, How to Realize "a Sense of Humour" in Computers? https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.3197.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, this magistral direction was not developed properly and subsequent investigations accepted somewhat specialized colouring.

==Joke generators==

===Pun generation===
An approach to analysis of humor is classification of jokes. A further step is an attempt to generate jokes basing on the rules that underlie classification.

Simple prototypes for computer [[pun]] generation were reported in the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Lessard, G. and Levison, M. (1992). Computational modeling of linguistic humour: Tom Swifties. In ALLC/ACH Joint Annual Conference, Oxford, pages 175–178.&lt;/ref&gt; based on a [[natural language generator]] program, [[VINCI (software)|VINCI]]. [[Graeme Ritchie (scientist)|Graeme Ritchie]] and [[Kim Binsted]] in their 1994 research paper described a computer program, JAPE, designed to generate question-answer-type [[pun]]s from a general, i.e., non-humorous, lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Binsted, Graeme Ritchie (1994) "A symbolic description of punning riddles and its computer implementation." Research Paper 688, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, 1994, reported at the International Conference on Humor and Laughter, Luxembourg, 1993
*(conference proceeding version of the above) An implemented model of punning riddles. In Proceedings of the Twelfth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-94), Seattle, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;  (The program name is an acronym for "Joke Analysis and Production Engine".) Some examples produced by JAPE are:

:Q: What is the difference between leaves and a car?
:A: One you brush and rake, the other you rush and brake.

:Q: What do you call a strange market?
:A: A bizarre bazaar.

Since then the approach has been improved, and the latest report, dated 2007, describes the STANDUP joke generator, implemented in the [[Java programming language]].&lt;ref name=rmpwbd&gt;Graeme Ritchie, Ruli Manurung, Helen Pain, Annalu Waller, Rolf Black, Dave O'Mara. "[http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/g.ritchie/pages/papers/ijwcc07.pdf A practical application of computational humour]." In Cardoso, A. &amp; Wiggins, G. (Ed.) Proceedings of the 4th. International Joint Workshop on Computational Creativity, London, UK, 2007, pp. 91–98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.abdn.ac.uk/ncs/departments/computing-science/standup-315.php STANDUP home page], with a link to free software download&lt;/ref&gt; The STANDUP generator was tested on children within the framework of analyzing its usability for language skills development for children with communication disabilities, e.g., because of [[cerebral palsy]]. (The project name is an acronym for "System To Augment Non-speakers' Dialog Using Puns" and an allusion to [[standup comedy]].) Children responded to this "language playground" with enthusiasm, and showed marked improvement on certain types of language tests.&lt;ref name=rmpwbd/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csd.abdn.ac.uk/research/standup/cuttings/20060819_www.thecourier.co.uk.html "Laughter is the best therapy"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610153820/http://www.csd.abdn.ac.uk/research/standup/cuttings/20060819_www.thecourier.co.uk.html |date=June 10, 2007 }}, ''The Courier'',  19 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5276366.stm "Joke software helps non-speakers"], ''[[BBC News]],'' 22 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The two young people, who used the system over a ten-week period, regaled their peers, staff, family and neighbors with jokes such as: "What do you call a spicy missile? A hot shot!" Their joy and enthusiasm at entertaining others was inspirational.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"AskTheBrain" (2002) [http://www.askthebrain.com/] used clustering and bayesian analysis to associate concepts in a comical way.

==Joke recognition==
A statistical machine learning algorithm to detect whether a sentence contained a "[[That's what she said]]" [[double entendre]] was developed by Kiddon and Brun (2011).&lt;ref&gt;Chloe Kiddon and Yuriy Brun (2011). "[http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P11/P11-2016.pdf That's What She Said: Double Entendre Identification."] In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 89–94, Portland, Oregon,
USA, June. Association for Computational Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an open-source Python implementation of Kiddon &amp; Brun's TWSS system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/tansaku/twss GitHub – tansaku/twss: A Python project inspired by the research of Chloé Kiddon and Yuriy Brun. Part of the Funniest Computer Ever Open Source initiative&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A program to recognize [[knock-knock joke]]s was reported by Taylor and Mazlack.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, J. M. and Mazlack, L. J. (2004). "Computationally recognizing wordplay in jokes". In ''Proceedings of Cognitive Science Conference'', pages 2166–2171, Stresa, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of research is important in analysis of human-computer interaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uc.edu/News/NR.aspx?ID=6139 "UC Researchers Design Humorous 'Bot'"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602033631/http://www.uc.edu/News/NR.aspx?ID=6139 |date=June 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An application of [[machine learning]] techniques for the distinguishing of joke texts from non-jokes was described by Mihalcea and Strapparava (2006).&lt;ref&gt;Mihalcea, R. and Strapparava, C. (2006). "Learning to laugh (automatically): Computational models
for humor recognition." ''[[Computational Intelligence (journal)|Computational Intelligence]]'', 22(2):126–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Takizawa ''et al.'' (1996) reported on a [[heuristic]] program for detecting puns in the [[Japanese language]].&lt;ref&gt;Osamu Takizawa, Masuzo Yanagida, Akira Ito, and Hitoshi Isahara (1996). "On Computational Processing of Rhetorical Expressions – Puns, Ironies and Tautologies". In (Hulstijn and Nijholt, 1996), 39–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
A possible application for the assistance in [[language acquisition]] is described in the section "Pun generation". Another envisioned use of joke generators is in cases of steady supply of jokes where quantity is more important than quality. Another obvious, yet remote, direction is automated joke appreciation.

It is known {{citation needed|date=April 2015}} that humans interact with computers in ways similar to interacting with other humans that may be described in terms of personality, politeness, flattery, and in-group favoritism. Therefore, the role of humor in [[human-computer interaction]] is being investigated. In particular, humor generation in [[user interface]] to ease communications with computers was suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Rada Mihalcea, carlo Strapparava, "Technologies That Make You Smile: Adding Humor to Text-Based Applications", ''[[IEEE Intelligent Systems]]'', 2006, vol. 21, no.5, pp. 33–39.

Mulder, A. Nijholt, (2002) "Humour Research: State of the Art"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig McDonough implemented the Mnemonic Sentence Generator, which converts [[password]]s into humorous sentences.  Basing on the [[Theory of humor#Incongruity|incongruity theory of humor]], it is suggested that the resulting meaningless but funny sentences are easier to remember. For example, the password AjQA3Jtv is converted into "Arafat joined Quayle's Ant, while TARAR Jeopardized thurmond's vase".&lt;ref&gt;Craigh McDonough (2001) "Using Natural Language Processing for random Passwords", Technical Report, [[CERIAS]], [[Purdue University]] (unpublished), as quoted by Mulder and Nijholt (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cosmic distance ladder''' (also known as the '''extragalactic distance scale''') is the succession of methods by which [[astronomy|astronomers]] determine the [[distance]]s to celestial objects. A real ''direct'' distance measurement of an astronomical object is possible only for those objects that are "close enough" (within about a thousand [[parsec]]s) to Earth. The techniques for determining distances to more distant objects are all based on various measured correlations between methods that work at close distances and methods that work at larger distances. Several methods rely on a '''standard candle''', which is an astronomical object that has a known [[luminosity]].

The ladder analogy arises because no single technique can measure distances at all ranges encountered in astronomy. Instead, one method can be used to measure nearby distances, a second can be used to measure nearby to intermediate distances, and so on. Each rung of the ladder provides information that can be used to determine the distances at the next higher rung.

At the base of the ladder are ''fundamental'' distance measurements, in which distances are determined directly, with no physical assumptions about the nature of the object in question. The precise measurement of stellar positions is part of the discipline of [[astrometry]].

=== Astronomical unit ===
{{main article|Astronomical unit}}

Direct distance measurements are based upon the [[astronomical unit]] (AU), which is the distance between the [[Earth]] and the [[Sun]].
[[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's laws]] provide precise [[ratio]]s of the sizes of the orbits of objects orbiting the Sun, but provides no measurement of the overall scale of the orbit system. [[Radar]] is used to measure the distance between the orbits of the Earth and of a second body. From that measurement and the ratio of the two orbit sizes, the size of Earth's orbit is calculated. The Earth's orbit is known with an absolute precision of a few meters and a relative precision of a few {{val|1|e=-11}}.

Historically, observations of [[Transit of Venus#Scientific interest in transits|transits of Venus]] were crucial in determining the AU; in the first half of the 20th century, observations of [[asteroids]] were also important. Presently the orbit of Earth is determined with high precision using [[radar]] measurements of distances to [[Venus]] and other nearby planets and asteroids,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ash |first1=M.

=== Parallax ===
{{main article|Parallax}}
{{see also|Stellar Parallax|Parsec}}

[[File:ParallaxeV2.png|thumb|right|Stellar parallax motion from annual parallax. Half the apex angle is the parallax angle.]]

The most important fundamental distance measurements come from trigonometric [[parallax]]. As the Earth orbits the Sun, the position of nearby stars will appear to shift slightly against the more distant background. These shifts are angles in an isosceles [[triangle]], with 2 [[astronomical unit|AU]] (the distance between the extreme positions of Earth's orbit around the Sun) making the base leg of the triangle and the distance to the star being the long equal length legs. The amount of shift is quite small, measuring 1 [[Minute and second of arc|arcsecond]] for an object at 1&amp;nbsp;[[parsec]]'s distance (3.26 [[light-year]]s) of the nearest stars, and thereafter decreasing in angular amount as the distance increases. Astronomers usually express distances in units of parsecs (parallax arcseconds); light-years are used in popular media.

Because parallax becomes smaller for a greater stellar distance, useful distances can be measured only for stars which are near enough to have a parallax larger than a few times the [[Accuracy and precision|precision]] of the measurement. Parallax measurements typically have an accuracy measured in milliarcseconds.&lt;ref&gt;

Stars have a velocity relative to the Sun that causes [[proper motion]] (transverse across the sky) and [[radial velocity]] (motion toward or away from the Sun). The former is determined by plotting the changing position of the stars over many years, while the latter comes from measuring the [[Doppler shift]] of the star's spectrum caused by motion along the line of sight. For a group of stars with the same spectral class and a similar magnitude range, a mean parallax can be derived from [[statistical analysis]] of the proper motions relative to their radial velocities. This [[statistical parallax]] method is useful for measuring the distances of bright stars beyond 50&amp;nbsp;parsecs and giant [[variable star]]s, including [[Cepheid variable|Cepheids]] and the [[RR Lyrae variable]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

The motion of the Sun through space provides a longer baseline that will increase the accuracy of parallax measurements, known as [[Stellar parallax|secular parallax]]. For stars in the Milky Way disk, this corresponds to a mean baseline of 4 [[astronomical unit|AU]] per year, while for halo stars the baseline is 40 AU per year. After several decades, the baseline can be orders of magnitude greater than the Earth–Sun baseline used for traditional parallax. However, secular parallax introduces a higher level of uncertainty because the relative velocity of observed stars is an additional unknown. When applied to samples of multiple stars, the uncertainty can be reduced; the uncertainty is inversely proportional to the [[square root]] of the sample size.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Parallax#Dynamic or moving-cluster parallax|Moving cluster parallax]] is a technique where the motions of individual stars in a nearby star cluster can be used to find the distance to the cluster. Only [[open cluster]]s are near enough for this technique to be useful. In particular the distance obtained for the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] has historically been an important step in the distance ladder.

Other individual objects can have fundamental distance estimates made for them under special circumstances. If the expansion of a gas cloud, like a [[supernova remnant]] or [[planetary nebula]], can be observed over time, then an ''expansion parallax'' distance to that cloud can be estimated. Those measurements however suffer from uncertainties in the deviation of the object from sphericity. [[Binary star]]s which are both [[Binary star#Visual binaries|visual]] and [[Binary star#Spectroscopic binaries|spectroscopic]] binaries also can have their distance estimated by similar means, and don't suffer from the above geometric uncertainty. The common characteristic to these methods is that a measurement of angular motion is combined with a measurement of the absolute [[velocity]] (usually obtained via the [[Doppler effect#Astronomy|Doppler effect]]). The distance estimate comes from computing how far the object must be to make its observed absolute velocity appear with the observed angular motion.

Expansion parallaxes in particular can give fundamental distance estimates for objects that are very far, because supernova ejecta have large expansion velocities and large sizes (compared to stars). Further, they can be observed with radio [[Interferometry|interferometers]] which can measure very small angular motions. These combine to provide fundamental distance estimates to supernovae in other galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;

== Standard candles&lt;!--'Standard candle' and 'Standard candles' redirects here--&gt; ==
Almost all astronomical objects used as physical distance indicators belong to a class that has a known brightness. By comparing this known [[luminosity]] to an object's observed brightness, the distance to the object can be computed using the [[inverse-square law]]. These objects of known brightness are termed '''standard candles'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.

The brightness of an object can be expressed in terms of its [[absolute magnitude]]. This quantity is derived from the logarithm of its luminosity as seen from a distance of 10 [[parsec]]s. The [[apparent magnitude]], the magnitude as seen by the observer (an instrument called a [[bolometer]] is used), can be measured and used with the absolute magnitude to calculate the distance ''D'' to the object in kiloparsecs (where 1&amp;nbsp;kpc equals 1000&amp;nbsp;parsecs) as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;5 \cdot \log_{10} D = m - M - 10,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt; D = 10^{(m -M -10)/5}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the apparent magnitude and ''M'' the absolute magnitude. For this to be accurate, both magnitudes must be in the same frequency band and there can be no relative motion in the radial direction.

Some means of correcting for interstellar [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]], which also makes objects appear fainter and more red, is needed, especially if the object lies within a dusty or gaseous region.&lt;ref name=ctypeia&gt;

 |accessdate=30 January 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between an object's absolute and apparent magnitudes is called its [[distance modulus]], and astronomical distances, especially intergalactic ones, are sometimes tabulated in this way.

=== Problems ===
Two problems exist for any class of standard candle. The principal one is [[calibration]], that is the determination of exactly what the absolute magnitude of the candle is. This includes defining the class well enough that members can be recognized, and finding enough members of that class with well-known distances to allow their true absolute magnitude to be determined with enough accuracy. The second problem lies in recognizing members of the class, and not mistakenly using a standard candle calibration on an object which does not belong to the class. At extreme distances, which is where one most wishes to use a distance indicator, this recognition problem can be quite serious.

A significant issue with standard candles is the recurring question of how standard they are. For example, all observations seem to indicate that [[Type Ia supernova]]e that are of known distance have the same brightness (corrected by the shape of the light curve). The basis for this closeness in brightness is discussed below; however, the possibility exists that the distant Type Ia supernovae have different properties than nearby Type Ia supernovae. The use of Type Ia supernovae is crucial in determining the correct [[Physical cosmology|cosmological model]]. If indeed the properties of Type Ia supernovae are different at large distances, i.e. if the extrapolation of their calibration to arbitrary distances is not valid, ignoring this variation can dangerously bias the reconstruction of the cosmological parameters, in particular the reconstruction of the matter [[Friedmann equations|density parameter]].&lt;ref name="Lindenetal2009"&gt;

That this is not merely a philosophical issue can be seen from the history of distance measurements using [[Cepheid variable]]s. In the 1950s, [[Walter Baade]] discovered that the nearby Cepheid variables used to calibrate the standard candle were of a different type than the ones used to measure distances to nearby galaxies. The nearby Cepheid variables were [[Stellar population|population I]] stars with much higher [[metallicity|metal]] content than the distant [[Stellar population|population II]] stars. As a result, the population II stars were actually much brighter than believed, and when corrected, this had the effect of doubling the distances to the globular clusters, the nearby galaxies, and the diameter of the [[Milky Way]].

== Standard siren ==
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}

[[Gravitational wave]]s originating from the [[Orbital decay|inspiral phase]] of compact binary systems, such as [[neutron star]]s or [[black hole]]s, have the useful property that both the amplitude and shape of the emitted gravitational radiation depend strongly on the [[chirp mass]] of the system. By observing the waveform, the chirp mass can be computed, and thus the amplitude. Further, gravitational waves are not subject to [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] due to an absorbing intervening medium. (They ''are'' subject to [[gravitational lens]]ing, however.) Thus, such a gravitational wave source is a "standard siren" of known loudness.&lt;ref name=HendryWoan2007&gt;{{Cite journal

The ratio of the source and received amplitudes allows the distance to be computed. Therefore, a standard siren can be used as a distance indicator on a cosmic scale. When the collision can be observed optically as well (in the case of a [[kilonova]] such as [[GW170817]]), the Doppler shift can be measured and the Hubble constant computed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently the physical scale imprinted by [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] (BAO) in the early universe has been used. 
In the early universe (before [[Recombination_(cosmology)|recombination]]) the baryons and photons scatter off each other, and form a tightly-coupled fluid that can support sound waves. The waves are sourced by primordial density perturbations, and travel at speed that can be predicted from the baryon density and other cosmological parameters. The total distance that these sound waves can travel before recombination determines a fixed scale, which simply expands with the universe after recombination. BAO therefore provide a standard ruler that can be measured in galaxy surveys from the effect of baryons on the clustering of galaxies. The method requires an extensive galaxy survey in order to make this scale visible, but has been measured with percent-level precision (see [[baryon acoustic oscillations]]). The scale does depend on cosmological parameters like the baryon and matter densities, and the number of neutrinos, so distances based on BAO are more dependent on cosmological model than those based on local measurements.

[[Light echo]]s can be also used as standard rulers,&lt;ref&gt;

== Galactic distance indicators ==
{{see also|distance measures (cosmology)}}

With few exceptions, distances based on direct measurements are available only out to about a thousand parsecs, which is a modest portion of our own Galaxy. For distances beyond that, measures depend upon physical assumptions, that is, the assertion that one recognizes the object in question, and the class of objects is homogeneous enough that its members can be used for meaningful estimation of distance.

Physical distance indicators, used on progressively larger distance scales, include:
* [[Dynamical parallax]], uses orbital parameters of [[visual binary|visual binaries]] to measure the mass of the system, and hence use the [[Mass–luminosity relation#In astronomy|mass–luminosity relation]] to determine the luminosity
**[[Binary star|Eclipsing binaries]] — In the last decade, measurement of eclipsing binaries' fundamental parameters has become possible with 8-meter class telescopes. This makes it feasible to use them as indicators of distance. Recently, they have been used to give direct distance estimates to the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] (LMC), [[Small Magellanic Cloud]] (SMC), [[Andromeda Galaxy]] and [[Triangulum Galaxy]]. Eclipsing binaries offer a direct method to gauge the distance to galaxies to a new improved 5% level of accuracy which is feasible with current technology to a distance of around 3 Mpc (3 million parsecs).&lt;ref name="Bonanos2006"&gt;

=== Main sequence fitting ===

When the absolute magnitude for a group of stars is plotted against the [[Stellar classification|spectral classification]] of the star, in a [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]], evolutionary patterns are found that relate to the mass, age and composition of the star. In particular, during their hydrogen burning period, stars lie along a curve in the diagram called the [[main sequence]]. By measuring these properties from a star's spectrum, the position of a main sequence star on the H–R diagram can be determined, and thereby the star's absolute magnitude estimated. A comparison of this value with the apparent magnitude allows the approximate distance to be determined, after correcting for interstellar [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] of the luminosity because of gas and dust.

In a gravitationally-bound [[star cluster]] such as the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]], the stars formed at approximately the same age and lie at the same distance. This allows relatively accurate main sequence fitting, providing both age and distance determination.

The extragalactic distance scale is a series of techniques used today by astronomers to determine the distance of cosmological bodies beyond our own galaxy, which are not easily obtained with traditional methods. Some procedures utilize properties of these objects, such as [[star]]s, [[globular cluster]]s, [[nebula]]e, and galaxies as a whole. Other methods are based more on the statistics and probabilities of things such as entire [[galaxy cluster]]s.

=== Wilson–Bappu effect ===
{{main article|Wilson–Bappu effect}}
Discovered in 1956 by [[Olin Chaddock Wilson|Olin Wilson]] and [[Vainu Bappu|M.K. Vainu Bappu]], the [[Wilson–Bappu effect]] utilizes the effect known as [[spectroscopic parallax]]. Many stars have features in their [[Astronomical spectroscopy|spectra]], such as the [[Fraunhofer lines|calcium K-line]], that indicate their [[absolute magnitude]]. The distance to the star can then be calculated from its [[apparent magnitude]] using the [[distance modulus]].

There are major limitations to this method for finding stellar distances. The calibration of the spectral line strengths has limited accuracy and it requires a correction for [[interstellar extinction]]. Though in theory this method has the ability to provide reliable distance calculations to stars up to 7 megaparsecs (Mpc), it is generally only used for stars at hundreds of kiloparsecs (kpc).

=== Classical Cepheids ===

Beyond the reach of the [[Wilson–Bappu effect]], the next method relies on the period-luminosity relation of classical [[Cepheid variable]] stars. The following relation can be used to calculate the distance to Galactic and extragalactic classical Cepheids:

: &lt;math&gt; 5\log_{10}{d}=V+ (3.34) \log_{10}{P} - (2.45) (V-I) + 7.52 \,. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=benedict2007&gt;Benedict, G. Fritz et al. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AJ....133.1810B "Hubble Space Telescope Fine Guidance Sensor Parallaxes of Galactic Cepheid Variable Stars: Period-Luminosity Relations"], ''The Astronomical Journal'', Volume 133, Issue 4, pp. 1810–1827 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt; 5\log_{10}{d}=V+ (3.37) \log_{10}{P} - (2.55) (V-I) + 7.48 \,. &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=majaess2011&gt;Majaess, Daniel; Turner, David; Moni Bidin, Christian; Mauro, Francesco; Geisler, Douglas; Gieren, Wolfgang; Minniti, Dante; Chené, André-Nicolas; Lucas, Philip; Borissova, Jura; Kurtev, Radostn; Dékány, Istvan; Saito, Roberto K.

L2 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Several problems complicate the use of Cepheids as standard candles and are actively debated, chief among them are: the nature and linearity of the period-luminosity relation in various passbands and the impact of metallicity on both the zero-point and slope of those relations, and the effects of photometric contamination (blending) and a changing (typically unknown) extinction law on Cepheid distances.&lt;ref name="stanekudalski1999"&gt;

These unresolved matters have resulted in cited values for the [[Hubble's law|Hubble constant]] ranging between 60&amp;nbsp;km/s/Mpc and 80&amp;nbsp;km/s/Mpc. Resolving this discrepancy is one of the foremost problems in astronomy since some cosmological parameters of the Universe may be constrained significantly better by supplying a precise value of the Hubble constant.&lt;ref name=tammannsandage2008&gt;

Cepheid variable stars were the key instrument in Edwin Hubble's 1923 conclusion that [[Andromeda Galaxy|M31]] (Andromeda) was an external galaxy, as opposed to a smaller nebula within the [[Milky Way]]. He was able to calculate the distance of M31 to 285 Kpc, today's value being 770 Kpc.

As detected thus far, NGC 3370, a spiral galaxy in the constellation Leo, contains the farthest Cepheids yet found at a distance of 29 Mpc. Cepheid variable stars are in no way perfect distance markers: at nearby galaxies they have an error of about 7% and up to a 15% error for the most distant.

=== Supernovae ===
[[File:SN1994D.jpg|thumb|[[SN 1994D]] (bright spot on the lower left) in the [[NGC 4526]] galaxy. Image by [[NASA]], [[ESA]], The Hubble Key Project Team, and The High-Z Supernova Search Team]]

There are several different methods for which [[supernova]]e can be used to measure extragalactic distances.

==== Measuring a supernova's photosphere ====
We can assume that a supernova expands in a spherically symmetric manner. If the supernova is close enough such that we can measure the angular extent, ''θ''(''t''), of its [[photosphere]], we can use the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ω'' is angular velocity, ''θ'' is angular extent. In order to get an accurate measurement, it is necessary to make two observations separated by time Δ''t''. Subsequently, we can use

:&lt;math&gt;\ d = \frac{V_{ej}}{\omega} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where d is the distance to the supernova, ''V&lt;sub&gt;ej&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the supernova's ejecta's radial velocity (it can be assumed that ''V&lt;sub&gt;ej&lt;/sub&gt;'' equals ''V&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;'' if spherically symmetric).

This method works only if the supernova is close enough to be able to measure accurately the photosphere. Similarly, the expanding shell of gas is in fact not perfectly spherical nor a perfect blackbody. Also interstellar extinction can hinder the accurate measurements of the photosphere. This problem is further exacerbated by core-collapse supernova. All of these factors contribute to the distance error of up to 25%.

==== Type Ia light curves ====

[[Type Ia supernovae]] are some of the best ways to determine extragalactic distances. Ia's occur when a binary white dwarf star begins to accrete matter from its companion star. As the white dwarf gains matter, eventually it reaches its [[Chandrasekhar limit]] of &lt;math&gt; 1.4 M_{\odot} &lt;/math&gt;.

Once reached, the star becomes unstable and undergoes a runaway nuclear fusion reaction. Because all Type Ia supernovae explode at about the same mass, their absolute magnitudes are all the same. This makes them very useful as standard candles. All Type Ia supernovae have a standard blue and visual magnitude of

:&lt;math&gt;\ M_B \approx M_V \approx -19.3 \pm 0.3 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, when observing a Type Ia supernova, if it is possible to determine what its peak magnitude was, then its distance can be calculated. It is not intrinsically necessary to capture the supernova directly at its peak magnitude; using the '''multicolor light curve shape''' method ('''MLCS'''), the shape of the light curve (taken at any reasonable time after the initial explosion) is compared to a family of parameterized curves that will determine the absolute magnitude at the maximum brightness. This method also takes into effect interstellar extinction/dimming from dust and gas.

Similarly, the '''stretch method''' fits the particular supernovae magnitude light curves to a template light curve. This template, as opposed to being several light curves at different wavelengths (MLCS) is just a single light curve that has been stretched (or compressed) in time. By using this ''Stretch Factor'', the peak magnitude can be determined.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Using Type Ia supernovae is one of the most accurate methods, particularly since supernova explosions can be visible at great distances (their luminosities rival that of the galaxy in which they are situated), much farther than Cepheid Variables (500 times farther). Much time has been devoted to the refining of this method. The current uncertainty approaches a mere 5%, corresponding to an uncertainty of just 0.1 magnitudes.

==== Novae in distance determinations ====

[[Nova]]e can be used in much the same way as supernovae to derive extragalactic distances. There is a direct relation between a nova's max magnitude and the time for its visible light to decline by two magnitudes. This relation is shown to be:

:&lt;math&gt;\ M^\max_V = -9.96 - 2.31 \log_{10} \dot{x} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the time derivative of the nova's mag, describing the average rate of decline over the first 2 magnitudes.

After novae fade, they are about as bright as the most luminous Cepheid variable stars, therefore both these techniques have about the same max distance: ~ 20 Mpc. The error in this method produces an uncertainty in magnitude of about&amp;nbsp;±0.4

=== Globular cluster luminosity function ===

Based on the method of comparing the luminosities of globular clusters (located in galactic halos) from distant galaxies to that of the [[Virgo Cluster]], the [[globular cluster luminosity function]] carries an uncertainty of distance of about 20% (or&amp;nbsp;0.4 magnitudes).

US astronomer William Alvin Baum first attempted to use globular clusters to measure distant elliptical galaxies. He compared the brightest globular clusters in Virgo A galaxy with those in Andromeda, assuming the luminosities of the clusters were the same in both. Knowing the distance to Andromeda, Baum has assumed a direct correlation and estimated Virgo A's distance.

Baum used just a single globular cluster, but individual formations are often poor standard candles. Canadian astronomer [[René Racine]] assumed the use of the globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF) would lead to a better approximation. The number of globular clusters as a function of magnitude is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \Phi (m) = A e^{(m-m_0)^2/2\sigma^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the turnover magnitude, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the magnitude of the Virgo cluster, and sigma is the dispersion&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;1.4 mag.

It is important to remember that it is assumed that globular clusters all have roughly the same luminosities within the [[universe]]. There is no universal globular cluster luminosity function that applies to all galaxies.

=== Planetary nebula luminosity function ===
Like the GCLF method, a similar numerical analysis can be used for [[planetary nebula]]e (note the use of more than one!) within far off galaxies. The [[planetary nebula luminosity function]] (PNLF) was first proposed in the late 1970s by Holland Cole and David Jenner. They suggested that all planetary nebulae might all have similar maximum intrinsic brightness, now calculated to be M = −4.53. This would therefore make them potential standard candles for determining extragalactic distances.

Astronomer George Howard Jacoby and his colleagues later proposed that the PNLF function equaled:

:&lt;math&gt;\ N (M) \propto e^{0.307 M} (1 - e^{3(M^{*} - M)} ) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Where N(M) is number of planetary nebula, having absolute magnitude M. M* is equal to the nebula with the brightest magnitude.

=== Surface brightness fluctuation method ===
[[File:Galaxy cluster Abell 2218 gravitaitonal lens.jpg|thumb|right|Galaxy cluster]]

The following method deals with the overall inherent properties of galaxies. These methods, though with varying error percentages, have the ability to make distance estimates beyond 100 Mpc, though it is usually applied more locally.

The [[surface brightness fluctuation]] (SBF) method takes advantage of the use of [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] cameras on telescopes. Because of spatial fluctuations in a galaxy's surface brightness, some pixels on these cameras will pick up more stars than others. However, as distance increases the picture will become increasingly smoother. Analysis of this describes a magnitude of the pixel-to-pixel variation, which is directly related to a galaxy's distance.

=== D–σ relation ===

The [[Sigma-D relation|D–σ relation]], used in [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]], relates the angular diameter (D) of the galaxy to its [[velocity dispersion]]. It is important to describe exactly what D represents, in order to understand this method. It is, more precisely, the galaxy's angular diameter out to the [[surface brightness]] level of 20.75 B-mag arcsec&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. This surface brightness is independent of the galaxy's actual distance from us. Instead, D is inversely proportional to the galaxy's distance, represented as d. Thus, this relation does not employ standard candles. Rather, D provides a [[standard ruler]]. This relation between D and σ is

:&lt;math&gt; \log (D) = 1.333 \log (\sigma) + C \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Where C is a constant which depends on the distance to the galaxy clusters.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

This method has the potential to become one of the strongest methods of galactic distance calculators, perhaps exceeding the range of even the Tully–Fisher method. As of today, however, elliptical galaxies aren't bright enough to provide a calibration for this method through the use of techniques such as Cepheids. Instead, calibration is done using more crude methods.

== Overlap and scaling ==
A succession of distance indicators, which is the distance ladder, is needed for determining distances to other galaxies. The reason is that objects bright enough to be recognized and measured at such distances are so rare that few or none are present nearby, so there are too few examples close enough with reliable trigonometric parallax to calibrate the indicator. For example, Cepheid variables, one of the best indicators for nearby [[Spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]], cannot yet be satisfactorily calibrated by parallax alone, though the Gaia space mission is expected to solve that specific problem. The situation is further complicated by the fact that different stellar populations generally do not have all types of stars in them. Cepheids in particular are massive stars, with short lifetimes, so they will only be found in places where stars have very recently been formed. Consequently, because [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] usually have long ceased to have large-scale star formation, they will not have Cepheids. Instead, distance indicators whose origins are in an older stellar population (like novae and RR Lyrae variables) must be used. However, RR Lyrae variables are less luminous than Cepheids, and novae are unpredictable and an intensive monitoring program—and luck during that program—is needed to gather enough novae in the target galaxy for a good distance estimate.

Because the more distant steps of the cosmic distance ladder depend upon the nearer ones, the more distant steps include the effects of [[error]]s in the nearer steps, both systematic and statistical ones. The result of these [[propagation of uncertainty|propagating errors]] means that distances in astronomy are rarely known to the same level of precision as measurements in the other sciences, and that the precision necessarily is poorer for more distant types of object.

Another concern, especially for the very brightest standard candles, is their "standardness": how homogeneous the objects are in their true absolute magnitude. For some of these different standard candles, the homogeneity is based on theories about the [[star formation|formation]] and [[stellar evolution|evolution]] of stars and galaxies, and is thus also subject to uncertainties in those aspects. For the most luminous of distance indicators, the Type Ia supernovae, this homogeneity is known to be poor&lt;ref name="Gilfanov2010"&gt;{{cite journal

The observational result of Hubble's Law, the [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] relationship between distance and the speed with which a galaxy is moving away from us (usually referred to as [[redshift]]) is a product of the cosmic distance ladder. [[Edwin Hubble]] observed that fainter galaxies are more redshifted. Finding the value of the Hubble constant was the result of decades of work by many astronomers, both in amassing the measurements of galaxy redshifts and in calibrating the steps of the distance ladder. Hubble's Law is the primary means we have for estimating the distances of [[quasar]]s and distant galaxies in which individual distance indicators cannot be seen.

{{lowercase title}}
'''CRISPR activation (CRISPRa)''' is one type of [[CRISPR]] tool that use modified versions of dCas9, a mutation of [[Cas9]] without [[endonuclease]] activity, with added [[Transcriptional activator|transcriptional]] [[Transcription factor|activators]] on dCas9 or the [[guide RNA]]s '''(gRNAs)'''.  Like a standard CRISPR-Cas9 system, dCas9 activation systems rely on similar components such as Cas9 variants for modulation or modification of genes, gRNAs to guide Cas9 to intended targets, and vectors for introduction into cells.  However, while a standard CRISPR-Cas9 system relies on creating breaks in DNA through the endonuclease activity of Cas9 and then manipulating [[DNA repair|DNA Repair mechanisms]] for [[Genome editing|gene editing]], dCas9 activation systems are modified and employ transcriptional activators to increase [[Gene expression|expression]] of genes of interest. Such systems are usable for many purposes including but not limited to, [[genetic screen]]s and overexpression of proteins of interest.

==Components==

===dCas9===

Cas9 Endonuclease Dead, also known as dead Cas9 or '''dCas9''', is a mutant form of [[Cas9]] whose endonuclease activity is removed through [[point mutation]]s in its endonuclease domains.  Similar to its unmutated form, dCas9 is used in CRISPR systems along with [[Guide RNA|gRNAs]] to target specific genes or [[nucleotide]]s complimentary to the gRNA with [[Protospacer adjacent motif|PAM sequences]] that allow Cas9 to bind. Cas9 ordinarily has 2 endonuclease domains called the RuvC and HNH domains.  The point mutations D10A and H840A change 2 important [[Amino acid|residues]] for endonuclease activity that ultimately results in its deactivation.  Although dCas9 lacks endonuclease activity, it is still capable of binding to its guide RNA and the [[DNA|DNA strand]] that is being targeted because such binding is managed by other domains.  This alone is often enough to attenuate if not outright block transcription of the targeted gene if the gRNA positions dCas9 in a way that prevents transcriptional factors and RNA polymerase from accessing the DNA.  However, this ability to bind DNA can also be exploited for activation since dCas9 has modifiable regions, typically the [[N-terminus|N]] and [[C-terminus|C terminus]] of the protein, that can be used to attach transcriptional activators.&lt;ref&gt;Addgene: CRISPR/Cas9 Guide https://www.addgene.org/crispr/guide/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guide RNA===
See: [[Guide RNA]], [[CRISPR#Genome engineering|CRISPR]]

A small guide RNA ('''sgRNA'''), or gRNA is an RNA with around 20 nucleotides used to direct Cas9 or dCas9 to their targets.  gRNAs contain two major regions of importance for CRISPR systems: the scaffold and spacer regions.  The spacer region has nucleotides that are complimentary to those found on the target genes, often in the [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] region.  The scaffold region is responsible for formation of a complex with (d)Cas9.  Together, they bind (d)Cas9 and direct it to the gene(s) of interest.  Since the spacer region of a gRNA can be modified for any potential sequence, they give CRISPR systems much more flexibility as any genes and nucleotides with a sequence complimentary to the spacer region can become possible targets.&lt;ref&gt;Addgene: CRISPR/Cas9 Guide https://www.addgene.org/crispr/guide/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcriptional Activators===

See: [[Transcriptional activator|Transcriptional Activator]], [[Transcription factor|Transcription Factor]]

'''Transcriptional Activators''' are protein domains or whole proteins linked to dCas9 or sgRNAs that assist in the recruitment of important co-factors as well as [[RNA Polymerase]] for [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]] of the [[Gene|gene(s)]] targeted by the system. In order for a protein to be made from the gene that encodes it, RNA polymerase must make RNA from the DNA template of the gene during a process called transcription. Transcriptional activators have a DNA binding domain and a domain for activation of transcription. The activation domain can recruit general [[transcription factor]]s or RNA polymerase to the gene sequence. Activation domains can also function by facilitating transcription by stalled RNA polymerases, and in eukaryotes can act to move [[nucleosome]]s on the DNA or modify [[histone]]s to increase gene expression.&lt;ref&gt;Ma, J. (August 2011). Transcriptional activators and activation mechanisms. Protein and Cell, '''2'''(11), 879-888.&lt;/ref&gt; These activators can be introduced into the system through attachment to dCas9 or to the sgRNA.  Some researchers have noted that the extent of transcriptional upregulation can be modulated by using multiple sites for activator attachment in one experiment and by using different variations and combinations of activators at once in a given experiment or sample.&lt;ref&gt;Maeder, M.; Linder, S.; Cascio, V.; Fu, Y.; Ho, Q.; Joung, J. CRISPR RNA–Guided Activation Of Endogenous Human Genes. Nature Methods 2013, 10, 977-979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konermann, S.; Brigham, M.; Trevino, A.; Joung, J.; Abudayyeh, O.; Barcena, C.; Hsu, P.; Habib, N.; Gootenberg, J.; Nishimasu, H. et al. Genome-Scale Transcriptional Activation By An Engineered CRISPR-Cas9 Complex. Nature 2014, 517, 583-588.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expression System===

An [[Gene expression#Expression system|expression system]] is required for the introduction of the gRNAs and (d)Cas9 proteins into the cells of interest.  Typically employed options include but are not limited to [[plasmid]]s and [[viral vectors]] such as [[adeno-associated virus]] (AAV) vector or [[lentivirus]] vector.

==Specific Activation Systems==
===VP64-p65-Rta===
The VP64-p65-Rta, or VPR, dCas9 activator was created by modifying an existing dCas9 activator, in which a Vp64 transcriptional activator is joined to the C terminus of dCas9. In the dCas9-VPR protein, the transcription factors p65 and Rta are added to the C terminus of dCas9-Vp64. Therefore, all three transcription factors are targeted to the same gene. The use of three transcription factors, as opposed to solely Vp64, results in increased expression of targeted genes. When different genes were targeted by dCas9, they all showed significantly greater expression with dCas9-VPR than with dCas9-VP64. It has also been demonstrated that dCas9-VPR can be used to increase expression of multiple genes within the same cell by putting multiple sgRNAs into the same cell.&lt;ref&gt;Chavez, A., Scheiman, J., Vora, S., Pruitt B.W., et al. (April 2015). “Highly efficient Cas9-mediated transcriptional programming.” Nat Methods. 12 (4):326-328. {{PMID|25730490}}. {{PMC|4393883}}. DOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3312.&lt;/ref&gt;
dCas9-VPR has been used to activate the neurogenin 2 (link) and neurogenic differentiation 1 (link) genes, resulting in differentiation of [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s into induced [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Chavez, A., Scheiman, J., Vora, S., Pruitt B.W., et al. (April 2015). “Highly efficient Cas9-mediated transcriptional programming.” Nat Methods. 12 (4):326-328. {{PMID|25730490}}. {{PMC|4393883}}. DOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3312.&lt;/ref&gt; A study comparing dCas9 activators found that the VPR, SAM, and Suntag activators worked best with dCas9 to increase gene expression in a variety of [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]], [[house mouse|mouse]], and [[human]] cell types &lt;ref&gt;Chavez, A., Tuttle, M., Pruitt, B.W, Ewen-Campen, B. (May 2016). “Comparison of Cas9 activators in multiple species.” Nat Methods. 13(7): 563-567. {{PMID|27214048}}. {{PMC|4927356}}. DOI: 10.1038/nmeth.3871.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“A guide to CRISPR gene activation.” Phys.org, May 23, 2016.

[[File:DCas9-VPR activator.svg|thumb|none|The dCas9-VPR activator increases transcription at the gene that it targets.]]

===Synergistic activation mediator===

To overcome the limitation of the dCas9-VP64 gene activation system, the dCas9-SAM system was developed to incorporate multiple transcriptional factors. Utilizing [[MS2 tagging|MS2]], [[RELA|p65]], and [[HSF1]] proteins, dCas9-SAM system recruits various transcriptional factors working synergistically to activate the gene of interest.[[File:DCas SAM system.png|thumb|left|The dCas-SAM system uses msgRNA that has attached aptamers for different transcriptional factors (MS2,p65 and HSF1) to bind.]]

In order to assemble different transcriptional activators, the dCas9-SAM system uses a modified [[Guide RNA|single guide RNA (sgRNA)]] that has binding sites for the MS2 protein. Hairpin [[aptamer]]s are attached to the tetra loop and the stem loop 2 of the sgRNA to become binding sites for dimerized MS2 bacteriophage coat proteins. As the hairpins are exposed outside of the dCas9-sgRNA complex, other transcriptional factors can bind to the MS2 protein without disrupting the dCas9-sgRNA complex. Thus, the MS2 protein is engineered to include p65 and HSF1 proteins. The MS2-p65-HSF1 fusion protein interacts with the dCas9-VP64 to recruit more transcriptional factors onto the promoter of the target genes.

Employing the dCas-SAM system, Zhang et al. (2015) successfully reactivated the latent HIV gene to over-express viral proteins from the HIV host cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Yonggang|last2=Yin|first2=Chaoran|last3=Zhang|first3=Ting|last4=Li|first4=Fang|last5=Yang|first5=Wensheng|last6=Kaminski|first6=Rafal|last7=Fagan|first7=Philip Regis|last8=Putatunda|first8=Raj|last9=Young|first9=Won-Bin|last10=Khalili|first10=Kamel|last11=Hu|first11=Wenhui|title=CRISPR/gRNA-directed synergistic activation mediator (SAM) induces specific, persistent and robust reactivation of the HIV-1 latent reservoirs|journal=Scientific Reports|date=5 November 2015|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.1038/srep16277}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were able to over-express viral proteins substantially to trigger apoptosis of HIV-1 latent cells due to the toxicity of viral proteins. In another dCas-SAM system experiment, Konermann et al. (2015) found genes in melanoma cells that give resistance to a BRAF inhibitor through activating candidate genes via dCas system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Konermann|first1=Silvana|last2=Brigham|first2=Mark D.|last3=Trevino|first3=Alexandro E.|last4=Joung|first4=Julia|last5=Abudayyeh|first5=Omar O.|last6=Barcena|first6=Clea|last7=Hsu|first7=Patrick D.|last8=Habib|first8=Naomi|last9=Gootenberg|first9=Jonathan S.|last10=Nishimasu|first10=Hiroshi|last11=Nureki|first11=Osamu|last12=Zhang|first12=Feng|title=Genome-scale transcriptional activation by an engineered CRISPR-Cas9 complex|journal=Nature|date=10 December 2014|volume=517|issue=7536|pages=583–588|doi=10.1038/nature14136|pmc=4420636}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the dCas9-SAM system can further be employed to activate latent genes, develop gene therapies, and discover new genes.

===SunTag===
The SunTag activator system uses the dCas9 protein, which is modified to be linked with the SunTag. The SunTag is a repeating polypeptide array that can recruit multiple copies of [[Antibody|antibodies]]. Through attaching transcriptional factors on the antibodies, the SunTag dCas9 activating complex amplifies its recruitment of transcriptional factors. In order to guide the dCas9 protein to its target gene, the dCas9 SunTag system uses [[Guide RNA|sgRNA]].

Tanenbaum et al.(2014) are credited for creating the dCas9 SunTag system. For the [[antibody|antibodies]], they employed [[Gcn4|GCN4]] antibodies which was bound to transcriptional factor VP64. In order to transport the antibodies to the nuclei of the cells, they attached [[Nuclear localization sequence|NLS]] tag. To confirm the nuclear localization of the antibodies, [[Green fluorescent protein|sfGFP]] was used for visualization purpose. Therefore, the GCN4-sfGFP-NLS-VP64 protein was developed to be interact with dCas SunTag system. The antibodies successfully bound to SunTag polypeptides and activated target CXCR4 gene in K562 cell lines.&lt;ref&gt;Tanenbaum M.E., Gilbert, L.A., Qi, L.S., Weissman, J.S., Vale, R.D. (October 2014). “A Protein-Tagging System for Signal Amplification in Gene Expression and Fluorescence Imaging.” Cell. 159 (3): 635-646. {{PMID|25307933}}. {{PMC|4252608}}. DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2014.09.039.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing with the dCas9-VP64 activation complex, they were able to increase the [[CXCR4]] gene expression 5-25 times greater in K562 cell lines. Not only was there a greater CXCR4 protein overexpression but also CXCR4 proteins were active to further travel on the transwell migration assay. Thus, the dCas9-SunTag system can be used to activate genes that are present latently such as virus genes.

==Applications/Future Directions==

The dCas9 activation system allows a desired gene or multiple genes in the same cell to be expressed. It is possible to study genes involved in a certain process using a [[genome]] wide screen that involves activating expression of genes. Examining which sgRNAs yield a phenotype suggests which genes are involved in a specific pathway. The dCas9 activation system can be used to control exactly which cells are activated and at what time activation occurs. dCas9 constructs have been made that turn on a dCas9-activator fusion protein in the presence of light or chemicals. Cells can also be reprogrammed or differentiated from one cell type into another by increasing the expression of certain genes important for the formation or maintenance of a cell type.&lt;ref&gt;Dominguez, A.A., Lim, W.A., and Qi, L.S. (December 2015). "Beyond editing: repurposing CRISPR–Cas9 for precision genome regulation and interrogation." ''Nat Rev Mol Cell Biology'', """17""", 5-15. {{PMID|26670017}} {{PMC|4922510}} DOI: 10.1038/nrm.2015.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greater  Control over Gene Expression===

One research group used a system in which dCas9 was fused to a particular domain, C1B1. When blue light is shined on the cell, the Cry2 domain binds to C1B1. The Cry2 domain is fused to a [[Transcription factor|transcriptional activator]], so blue light targets the activator to the spot where dCas9 is bound. The use of light allows a great deal of control over when the targeted gene is activated. Removing the light from the cell results in only dCas9 remaining at the target gene, so expression is not increased. In this way, the system is reversible.&lt;ref&gt;Nihongaki, Y., Yamamoto, S., Kawano, F., Suzuki, H., Moritoshi, S. "CRISPR-Cas9 based Photoactivatable Transcription System." ''Chemistry and Biology'', """22""", 169-174. {{PMID|25619936}} DOI: 10.1016/j.chembiol.2014.12.011.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar system was developed using chemical control. In this system, dCas9 recruits an MS2 fusion protein that contains the domain FKBP. In the presence of the chemical RAP, an FRB domain fused to a chromatin modifying complex binds to FKBP. Whenever RAP is added to the cells, a specific [[Chromatin remodeling|chromatin modifier complex]] can be targeted to the gene. That allows scientists to examine how specific [[chromatin]] modifications affect the expression of a gene.&lt;ref&gt;Braun, S.M.G., Kirkland, J.G., Chory, E.J., Husmann, D., Calarco, J.P., Crabtree, G.R. (Sep. 2017). "Rapid and reversible epigenome editing by endogenous chromatin regulators." ''Nat Commun'', """8""", {{PMID|28916764}} {{PMC|5601922}} DOI: 10.1038/s41467-017-00644-y.&lt;/ref&gt; The dCAs9-VPR system is used as an activator by targeting it to the promotor of a gene upstream of the coding region. A study used various sgRNAs to target different portions of the gene, finding that the dCas9-VPR activator can act as an activator or a repressor, depending on the location it binds. In a cell, sgRNAs targeting the [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] could allow dCas9-VPR to increase expression, while sgRNAs targeting the coding region of the gene result in dCas9-VPR decreasing expression.&lt;ref&gt;Deaner, M., Mejia, J., Alper, H.S. (Oct. 2017). "Enabling Graded and Large-Scale Multiplex of Desired Genes Using a Dual-Mode dCas9 Activator in Saccharomyces cerevisiae." ''ACS Synth Biol'', """6""" , {{PMID|28700213}} DOI: 10.1021/acssynbio.7b00163.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genome Wide Activation===
The versatility of sgRNAs allows dCas9 activators to increase the expression of any gene within an organism's genome. That could be used to increase expression of a protein coding gene or a transcribed RNA. A paper demonstrated that genome wide activation could be used to determine which proteins are involved in mediated resistance to a specific drug.&lt;ref&gt;Konermann, S.; Brigham, M.; Trevino, A.; Joung, J.; Abudayyeh, O.; Barcena, C.; Hsu, P.; Habib, N.; Gootenberg, J.; Nishimasu, H. et al. (2014). "Genome-Scale Transcriptional Activation By An Engineered CRISPR-Cas9 Complex." ''Nature'', 517, 583-588.&lt;/ref&gt; Another paper used genome wide activation of [[Long non-coding RNA|long, noncoding RNAs]] and observed that increasing the expression of certain long noncoding RNAs conferred resistance to the drug vemurafenib.&lt;ref&gt;Joung, J., Engreitz, J.M., Konermann, S., Abudayyeh, O.O., Verdine, V.K., Aguet, F., Gootenberg, J.S., Sanjana, N.E., Wright, J.B., Fulco, C.P., Tseng, Y.Y., Yoon, C.H., Boehm, J.S., Lander E.S., Zhang, F (Aug. 2017). "Genome-scale activation screen identifies a lncRNA locus regulating a gene neighbourhood." ''Nature'', 548: 343-346. {{PMID|28792927}} DOI: 10.1038/nature23451.&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the cells that survive the drug could be studied to determine which sgRNAs they contain. That allows researchers to determine which gene was activated in each surviving cell, which suggests which genes are important for resistance to that drug.

===Use in Organisms===
A dCas9 fusion with VP64, p65, and [[HSF1]] (heat shock factor 1) allowed researchers to target genes in [[Arabidopsis thaliana]] and increase transcription to a similar level as when the gene itself is inserted into the plant’s genome. For one of the two genes tested, the dCas9 activator changes the number and size of leaves and made the plants better able to handle drought. The authors conclude that the dCas9 activator can create phenotypes in plants that are similar to those observed when a transgene is inserted for overexpression.&lt;ref&gt;Park, J.J., Dempewolf, E., Zhang, W., Wang, Z.Y. (Jun. 2017). "RNA-guided transcriptional activation via CRISPR/dCas9 mimics overexpression phenotypes in Arabidopsis." ''PLoS One'', {{PMID|28622347}} {{PMC|5473554}} DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0179410.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have used multiple guide RNAs to target dCas9 activation system to multiple genes in a specific mouse strain in which dCas9 can be turned on in specific cell lines using the [[Cre recombinase]] system. Scientists used the targeting and increased expression of several genes to examine the processes involved in [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] and [[carcinoma]]s of the [[liver]].&lt;ref&gt;Wangensteen, K.J., Wang, Y.J., Dou, Z., Wang. A.W., Mosleh-Shirazi, E., Horlbeck, M.A., Gilbert, L.A., Weissman, J.S., Berger, S.L., Kaestner, K.H. (Nov. 2017).

[[File:EPIC Systems Demonstration Plant.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstration Plant]]

A '''demonstration plant''' is an industrial system used to validate an industrial process for commercialization. It is larger than a [[pilot plant]], and is the final stage in research, development and demonstration of a new process. Demonstration plants are built in a range of sizes, and the term 'demonstration plant' can sometimes be used interchangeably with 'pilot plant.' However, demonstration plants are generally larger than pilot plants are often constructed following a successful trial in a pilot scale size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gertenbach|first1=Dennis|last2=Cooper|first2=Brian|title=SCALEUP ISSUES FROM BENCH TO PILOT|url=http://www.hazenresearch.com/sites/default/files/case-study/scaleup_issues_from_bench_to_pilot.pdf|website=Hazen Research|publisher=AIChE|accessdate=28 March 2016|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstration plants are used to prove a process works at industrial scale, and is financially viable in its intended industry.

==Goals==
The goals of a demonstration plant are generally as follows:
* Prove a new technology using commercially available, pre-tested equipment.
* Show a reasonable [[return on investment]] ROI for the capital that will be invested in a full-scale system, including the operational costs of running such a system.
* In some case, to start bringing product to market in significant enough amounts that production, distribution and target market viability can be established, including finalization of market testing.
* Establish a viable product method that will endure the test of a true manufacturing operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alpert|first1=S.B.|title=DEMONSTRATION PLANTS: ARE THEY NEEDED?|url=https://web.anl.gov/PCS/acsfuel/preprint%20archive/Files/36_1_ATLANTA_04-91_0362.pdf|website=Argonne National Laboratory|publisher=Electric Power Research Institute|accessdate=28 March 2016|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design factors==
Many of the same design techniques that are used for pilot plants are also used when developing demonstration plants. 3D Modeling, chemical similitude studies, mass and energy balances, risk factors, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and mathematical modeling are common techniques used to design demonstration modules before actual fabrication occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schott|first1=John|title=DEMONSTRATION PLANTS|url=https://www.epicmodularprocess.com/systems/pilot-plant/demonstration-plant |website=EPIC Modular Process|publisher=EPIC Systems, Inc.|accessdate=31 May 2016|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emphasis in a demonstration plant is on using industrial equipment, rather than smaller-scale equipment, to prove process viability. A significant amount of product must be produced in equipment that will hold up over a long production lifetime and not be prohibitively expensive. A demonstration plant must show that enough end-product can be created to offset the costs of the commercial system over a period of time.

'''''Emigre''''' ({{ISSN|1045-3717}}) was a graphic design magazine published by [[Emigre (type foundry)|Emigre Graphics]] between 1984 and 2005; it was first published in 1984 in [[San Francisco, California]], United States. Art-directed by [[Rudy VanderLans]] using fonts designed by his wife, [[Zuzana Licko]], ''Emigre'' was one of the first publications to use [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers and had a large influence on graphic designers moving into [[desktop publishing]] (DTP). Its variety of layouts, use of guest designers, and opinionated articles also had an effect on other design publications.

The focus of ''Emigre'' was both redundant and wandering — both positive qualities as a journal produced by a tight and evolving group of designers and writers with Vanderlans at the center. Vanderlans was typically editor, though guest-editors also appeared ([[Gail Swanlund]], Anne Burdick, Andrew Blauvelt) and the work/writing of Zuzana Licko and [[Jeffery Keedy]] reappeared throughout the magazine's history.

The magazine began in 1984 with a focus on the [[émigré]]. The first eight issues were concerned with boundaries, international culture, travel accounts and alienation (as the issues' titles suggest). The first eight issues also incorporated a dynamic aesthetic that caught the attention of designers and led to the next stage in the magazine's evolution.

Beginning with Issue 9 — devoted to the art of [[Vaughan Oliver]] at [[4AD]] — the magazine explored design in itself, devoting issues to [[Cranbrook Educational Community|Cranbrook]], the [[Macintosh]], type design and individual graphic designers. In two issues in 1992 and 1993, the magazine chronicled the work of [[David Carson (graphic designer)|David Carson]] and [[Ray Gun (magazine)|Raygun]].

Increasingly, ''Emigre'' became a platform for essays and writings on design. This aspect of ''Emigre'' came to the forefront with issues in 1994 and the magazine changed its format in 1995 from its oversized layout to a text-friendlier format that debuted with Issue 33. The magazine retained this character through Issue 59 in 2001.

Emigre then took a sharp turn with four re-formatted issues in 2001 and 2002 that included one DVD ("Catfish," an experimental documentary film on the work of designer and performance artist Elliott Earls) and three compact discs (featuring the music of [[Honey Barbara]], [[The Grassy Knoll (band)|The Grassy Knoll]] and Scenic.

In its fifth and final incarnation, the last six issues of ''Emigre'' were co-published by [[Princeton Architectural Press]] as small softcover books. The last issue, The End, was published in 2005.

==Formats==
The magazine changed formats several times: it was originally published quarterly in a large format where each page measures 285&amp;nbsp;mm x 425&amp;nbsp;mm (slightly shorter than 11" x 17" or US ledger/tabloid size); starting with issue 33, each page was about 8.5" x 11" (US letter size); it changed into a multimedia format (a booklet where each page was 133&amp;nbsp;mm x 210&amp;nbsp;mm, plus a [[CD]] or [[DVD]]) starting with issue 60; and finally, starting with issue 64, the magazine became a book format, published semi-annually, where each page measured 133&amp;nbsp;mm x 210&amp;nbsp;mm. The issues in the book format were co-published by [[Princeton Architectural Press]].

'''Environmental engineering science''' ('''EES''') is a [[multidisciplinary]] field of [[engineering science]] that combines the [[biological]], [[chemical]] and physical sciences with the field of engineering.  This major traditionally requires the student to take basic engineering classes in fields such as [[thermodynamics]], advanced [[math]], computer modeling and [[simulation]] and technical classes in subjects such as [[statics]], [[mechanics]], [[hydrology]], and [[fluid dynamics]]. As the student progresses, the upper division elective classes define a specific field of study for the student with a choice in a [[Environmental Engineering Science#Electives|range]] of science, technology and engineering related classes.&lt;ref name="Berkeley" /&gt;

==Difference with related fields==
[[Image:CalifAcadSciRoof 0820.JPG|thumb|right|Graduates of Environmental Engineering Science can go on to work on the technical aspects of designing a [[Green roof|Living Roof]] like the one pictured here at the [[California Academy of Science|California Academy of the Sciences]]]]
As a recently created program, environmental engineering science has not yet been incorporated into the terminology found among [[Environment (biophysical)|environmentally]] focused professionals.  In the few engineering colleges that offer this major, the curriculum shares more classes in common with [[environmental engineering]] than it does with [[environmental science]].  Typically, EES students follow a similar course curriculum with environmental engineers until their fields diverge during the last year of college.  The majority of the environmental engineering students must take classes designed to connect their knowledge of the environment to modern [[building materials]] and [[construction]] methods.  This is meant to direct the environmental engineer into a field where they will more than likely assist in building [[wastewater treatment|treatment facilities]], preparing [[environmental impact assessment]]s or helping to mitigate [[air pollution]] from specific point sources.

Meanwhile, the environmental engineering science student will choose a direction for their [[career]].  From the range of electives they have to choose from, these students can move into a fields such as the design of [[Radioactive waste|nuclear storage facilities]], bacterial [[bioreactors]] or [[environmental policies]]. These students combine the practical design background of an engineer with the detailed theory found in many of the [[biology|biological]] and [[physical sciences]].

==Description at universities==
===Stanford University===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Civil and Environmental Engineering department at Stanford University provides the following description for their program in Environmental Engineering and Science:
The Environmental Engineering and Science (EES) program focuses on the chemical and biological processes involved in water quality engineering, water and air pollution, remediation and hazardous substance control, human exposure to pollutants, environmental biotechnology, and environmental protection.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


===UC Berkeley===
The College of Engineering at [[UC Berkeley]] defines Environmental Engineering Science, including the following:&lt;ref name="Berkeley"&gt;{{cite news|pages=27–28 |title=Engineering Announcement 2008-2009 |url=http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/EngAnn08.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203005457/http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/EngAnn08.pdf |archivedate=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is a multidisciplinary field requiring an integration of physical, chemical and biological principles with engineering analysis for environmental protection and restoration. The program incorporates courses from many departments on campus to create a discipline that is rigorously based in science and engineering, while addressing a wide variety of environmental issues. Although an environmental engineering option exists within the civil engineering major, the engineering science curriculum provides a more broadly based foundation in the sciences than is possible in civil engineering
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Massachusetts Institute of Technology===

At [[MIT]], the major is described in their curriculum, including the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MIT Course Catalog: Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. |url=http://web.mit.edu/catalogue/degre.engin.civil.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Bachelor of Science in Environmental Engineering Science emphasizes the fundamental physical, chemical, and biological processes necessary for understanding the interactions between man and the environment. Issues considered include the provision of clean and reliable water supplies, flood forecasting and protection, development of renewable and nonrenewable energy sources, causes and implications of climate change, and the impact of human activities on natural cycles
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:Vacuum distillation of DMSO at 70C.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Wet labs are required as part of the lower division curriculum]]

==Lower division coursework==

Lower division coursework in this field requires the student to take several laboratory-based classes in calculus-based physics, chemistry, biology, [[Mathematical programming|programming]] and [[analysis]].  This is intended to give the student background information in order to introduce them to the engineering fields and to prepare them for more technical information in their upper division coursework.

==Upper division coursework==
[[Image:FAE visualization.jpg|left|thumb|Students learn to integrate their math and statistics with software to perform analysis of physical [[systems]] like the [[Finite Element Analysis]] shown above]]

==Post graduation work==

The multidisciplinary approach in Environmental Engineering Science gives the student expertise in technical fields related to their own personal interest.  While some graduates choose to use this major to go to graduate school,&lt;ref name="Berkeley" /&gt; students who choose to work often go into the fields of [[civil engineering|civil]] and [[environmental engineering]], [[biotechnology]], and research.  However, the less technical math, programming and writing background gives the students opportunities to pursue [[information technology|IT]] work and [[technical writing]].

'''Epidemiology of representations''', or cultural epidemiology, provides a conceptual framework for explaining cultural phenomena by how mental representations get distributed within a population. The theory appeals to an analogy with medical [[epidemiology]]; because "...macro-phenomena such as [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] and [[epidemic]] diseases are unpacked in terms of patterns of micro-phenomena of individual [[pathology]] and inter-individual transmission".&lt;ref name="Sperber2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sperber|first=D.|title=Conceptual tools for a natural science of society and culture (Radcliffe-Brown Lecture in Social Anthropology 1999)|journal=Proceedings of the British Academy|year=2001|volume=111|pages=297–317|url=http://www.dan.sperber.fr/?p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Representations get transferred via so called cognitive causal chains (cf. Table 1). The stability of public productions and mental representations (constituting a cultural phenomenon) is explained via ecological and psychological factors. The latter include properties of the human mind and cultural epidemiologists have emphasized the significance of evolved properties: the existence of naïve theories, domain-specific abilities, principles of relevance.&lt;ref name=SperberHirschfeld /&gt;

The theory has been formulated mainly by the French social and cognitive scientist [[Dan Sperber]] for the study of society and culture, by taking into account evidence from [[anthropology]] and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name="Sperber2001" /&gt;

== Theory of cognitive causal chains ==

=== Cognitive causal chains ===
A cognitive causal chain (CCC) links a mental representation (e.g. satisfaction, justification, truth-value or similarity of content) with individual behaviors and mental processes (e.g. perception, inference, remembering, and the carrying out of an intention). More generally, it links something that can be perceived with the evolved and domain-specific process that makes it perceivable; for example, a [[visual perception]] of a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] that leads to a mental representation of the stimulus that triggered it.

Here is an example of a CCC:

:On October 31, at 7:30 p.m., Mrs. Jones's doorbell rings. Mrs. Jones hears the doorbell, and assumes that there is somebody at the door. She remembers it is [[Halloween]]: she enjoyed receiving treats as a child, and now, as an adult, she enjoys giving them. She guesses that there must be children at the door ready to trick-or-treat, and that, if she opens, she will be able to give them the candies she has bought for the occasion. Mrs. Jones decides to open the door, and does so.&lt;ref name="Sperber2001" /&gt;

=== Social cognitive causal chains (SCCCs) ===
Social cognitive causal chains (SCCCs) are inter-individual CCCs. A SCCC always implies individual CCCs but a CCC just leads to a SCCC if it involves an inter-individual act of [[communication]] or other effective forms of non-communicative interaction.

Here is an example of a SCCC involving an act of communication (ringing a doorbell):

:Billy and Julia are following the Halloween practice of going from door to door in the street, hoping to be given candies. When they reach Mrs. Jones's door, Billy rings the bell with the intention of letting the house owner know that someone is at the door, and of making her open the door ... [plug in Mrs. Jones's story as told above] ... Mrs. Jones opens the door. Billy and Julia shout 'trick or treats!' Mrs. Jones gives them candies.&lt;ref name="Sperber2001" /&gt;

=== Cultural cognitive causal chains ===
Human interaction involves many cases of ad-hoc cultural cognitive causal chains (SCCCs) that do not follow a significant long-term pattern over many people. Yet, other SCCCs can be long-lasting, systematical, and across a large population; for example, the Halloween custom mentioned above. The latter kinds of SCCCs arguably stabilize mental representations intra- and inter-individually to an extent that they can be considered as cultural if their behavior (practices and resulting artifacts) significantly represent their population. A CCCC therefore always implies SCCCs but a SCCC just leads to a CCCC if it involves one or more SCCCs that significantly indicate mental representations or public productions.

== Cultural stability, diversity, and massive modularity ==
Epidemiology of representations suggests that both cultural diversity and stability (macro-level) together can be explained by the [[Modularity of mind#Evolutionary psychology and massive modularity|massive modularity]] of the human brain and mind (micro-level) and SCCCs. This means that the manifold of human cultural behavior is ultimately explained by the manifold of [[Domain specificity|domain-specific]] human cognitive abilities ([[mental representation]]s) and respective SCCC. This claim would have broad impact, when applicable. It is discussed in further detail by Sperber and Hirschfeld for the cases of [[folkbiology]], folksociology, and [[supernaturalism]].&lt;ref name=SperberHirschfeld&gt;{{cite book|last=Sperber|first=D.; Hirschfeld, L.|title=Culture, Cognition, and Evolution|year=1999|publisher=In Robert Wilson &amp; Frank Keil (eds) MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=cxi-cxxxii|url=http://www.dan.sperber.fr/?p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Here is an example: Think about a human cognitive sub-system that must have been very important for human cognitive evolution (i.e. a module with an [[innate]] basis); like the ability that allows humans to recognize and interpret visual patterns as faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meltzoff|first=A.|title=Imitation,Memory, and the Representation of Person|journal=Infant Behavior and Development|year=1994|volume=17|pages=83–99|doi=10.1016/0163-6383(94)90024-8|last2=Keith Moore|first2=M.|pmc=4137868}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morton|first=J.|author2=Johnson, M.H.|title=CONSPEC and CONLERN: a two-process theory of infant face recognition|journal=Psychological Review|year=1991|volume=98|series=2|pages=164–81|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.98.2.164|pmid=2047512|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can call this cognitive sub-system the human "face recognition module". It was most likely built by evolution to recognize and interpret animal faces via decoding [[facial expressions]] produced by a complex system of [[facial muscles]]. Humans with certain types of brain damage lose this ability (c.f. [[prosopagnosia]], [[Social-Emotional Agnosia]]). Yet, the module also processes visual input that is relatively similar to patterns of natural faces. Such can be cultural artifacts like portraits, caricatures, masks, and made-up faces.

According to the epidemiology of representation the [[effectiveness]] (defined by its [[Relevance theory|relevance]]) of a public production depends on the extent to which it exploits a human cognitive module. Cultural artifacts "...rely on and exploit a natural disposition. Often, they exaggerate crucial features, as in caricature or in make up, and constitute what [[Ethology|ethologists]] call '[[Superstimulus|superstimuli]].'"&lt;ref name=SperberHirschfeld /&gt; Two domains of cognitive modules can therefore be distinguished: the proper, natural domain and the actual, cultural domain. In the above example, the first relates to natural faces, the second to portraits, caricatures, masks, and made-up faces. Those categories can intersect, like shown in Figure 2. Since made-up faces literally overlap the proper with the actual domain, they are the most effective and relevant public product in the example. Therefore, they lead to the most stable CCCC, if they significantly reflect the population's behavior. The other stimuli in the cultural domain will theoretically be as efficient and stable depending on the extent that they exploit the "face perception module".&lt;ref name=SperberHirschfeld /&gt;

[[File:Domains of a cognitive module.png|thumb|right|Figure 2: A hypothetical [[Venn diagram]] of the cognitive domains of the "human face module".]]

== Inter-individual stability of mental representations ==
Epidemiology of representations states that there must be a SCCC, the mechanism inter-linking a mental representation with an individual behavior, for the latter and explains its stability over time and space by the [[Relevance theory|relevance theoretical]] status of the underlying behavior. There are three minimal conditions for an inter-individual replication that ensures transfer stability.

For ''b'' to be an actual replication of ''a'',
# ''b'' must be caused by ''a'' (together with situational and background conditions)
# ''b'' must be similar in [[Relevance theory|relevant]] respects to ''a''
# ''b'' must inherit from ''a'' the properties that make it [[Relevance theory|relevantly]] similar to ''a''.&lt;ref name="Sperber2001" /&gt;

Here is an example:

Imagine one (A) produces a line-drawing (a), see Figure 3, and then shows it to a friend (B) for ten seconds. An asks the friend ten minutes later to reproduce it as exactly as possible with another line-drawing (b). After that, a second person is shown for ten seconds the figure drawn by your friend and presented with the same task. This is iterated with nine further participants. Now, theoretically, it is most likely that each drawing will differ from its model (a) and that the more distant two drawings are in the chain, the more they are likely to differ. Imagine further, you conduct exactly the same little experiment, but with the line-drawing in Figure 4. The result, you theoretically get this time, may be such that "...the distance in the chain of two drawings on the one hand, and their degree of difference on the other hand should be two variables independent of one another.";&lt;ref name="Sperber2001" /&gt; meaning that it was a chain of stable replications.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:A random line drawing.png|thumb|right|Figure 3: A line-drawing (''a'') that has no discernible meaning.{{deletable image-caption|Saturday, 28 July 2018|F7}}]] --&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:A linedrawing of a star.png|thumb|right|Figure 4: A line-drawing (''b'') that resembles a star.{{deletable image-caption|Saturday, 28 July 2018|F7}}]] --&gt;

Theoretically, this is because Figure 4 looks like a five-branched star, drawn without lifting the pencil, whereas Figure 3 has no [[Perception|perceivable]] meaning (at least in our [[western culture]]), the second chain is a SCCC but not so the first. Arguably and on the one hand, the second causal chain was driven by perceiving the shared meaning of the stimulus by inferring the underlying mental representation and a sequential reproduction of by new behavior. On the other hand, the first causal chain was driven by  mere [[imitation]] that does not crucially depends on recognition of the underlying meaning. There are forms of inter-individual transfer of behavior that blend reproduction and imitation to different extends. However, the more the meaning of a stimulus is actually reproduced rather than imitated by a subject, the more stable the transfer of the underlying mental representation is supposed to be over time.&lt;ref name=Sperber2000&gt;{{cite book|last=Sperber|first=D.|title=An Objection to the Memetic Approach to Culture|year=2000|publisher=in Robert Aunger ed. Darwinizing Culture: The Status of Memetics as a Science|location=Oxford|url=http://www.dan.sperber.fr/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/meme.pdfh16Q&amp;cad=rja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology of representations,  cognitive science and domain specificity ==
Like cognitive science, the epidemiology of representations is also based on the assumption that [[domain-specific|domain specificity]] characterizes cognitive abilities or mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Bermudez /&gt; Epidemiology of representations assumes that human animals are cognitively predefined by their evolved neurophysiology (i.e. their cognition is [[Modularity of mind#Evolutionary psychology and massive modularity|massively modular]]). However, it also acknowledges that [[cognitive development]] plays a functional role for the formation of mental representations, concepts, intuitive theories, and the like.&lt;ref name="Sperber2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name=SperberHirschfeld /&gt;
Accordingly, theories in cognitive science argue that humans are evolutionarily equipped with a certain brain-body setup (c.f. [[common coding theory]]) that allows them to encode and decode specific kinds of information to their memory via interacting with their environment. This is [[Sensory receptor|sensory]]-specific (i.e. [[Visual perception|visual]]-, [[Acoustics|acoustic]]-, [[Touch|tactile]]-, and [[Olfaction|olfactory perception]] etc.) and task or reasoning specific (i.e. formulation of intuitive theories). Hence, by these theories, humans are assumed to have (1) an [[Psychological nativism|innate]] cognitive potential that (2) is realized during a natural cognitive development.&lt;ref name=Bermudez&gt;{{cite book|last=Bermúdez|first=José Luis|title=Cognitive science: An introduction to the science of the mind|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge Univ Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carey2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Carey|first=S.|title=The Origin of Concepts|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reason for the first argument comes from fields like [[evolutionary anthropology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]], stating that evolution has been selecting merely those animals that have evolved adaptive mental and neural mechanisms to efficiently cope with specific challenges regarding their environment (e.g. getting food, shelter, mates, etc.).&lt;ref name=CosmidesTooby&gt;{{cite book|last=Cosmides|first=L.; Tooby, J.|title=In J. Barkow, L. Cosmides, and J. Tooby, eds., The Adapted Mind|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=163–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the second argument comes from [[cognitive development]], stating that animals (especially humans) in their infancy are highly sensitive to input patterns, since their cognitive system automatically and rapidly adapts their environment.&lt;ref name=Carey2009 /&gt;

Since the human brain is organized into areas that focus on the processing of distinct sensory input and output and also interact with one another, humans are assumed to learn and perform best in processing those patterns of information for which their neurophysiological system has been evolved.&lt;ref name=Bermudez /&gt; Mental representations manifest, for example, in human [[long-term memory]] (Figure 1). Other evidence for massive modularity is that human cognitive performance for respective domains correlates with the degree of damage to the corresponding cortical areas.&lt;ref name=Kandel&gt;{{cite book|last=Kandel|first=E.R.; Schwartz, J.H.; Jessell, T.M.|title=Principles of Neural Science|year=2000|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology of representations versus memetics ==
{{See also|Evolutionary psychology and culture|}}
The cognitive approach in the epidemiology of representations differs from other [[Philosophical theory|philosophical theories]] with evolutionary orientation, such as [[memetics]], formulated by the British [[Ethology|ethologist]] and [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] (cf.&lt;ref name=Dawkins1976&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=R.|title=The Selfish Gene|year=1976|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawkins1982&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=R.|title=The Extended Phenotype|year=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Roughly speaking, the three crucial differences between the two approaches are the following:
# epidemiology of representations atomizes culture to [[mental representation]]s and individual [[behavior]], whereas memetics atomizes culture to [[memes]]
# individual behavior in SCCC is replicated, whereas memes are imitated (cf. Inter-Individual Stability of Mental Representations)
# stability of mental representation over time is explained by [[relevance theory|relevance]] and [[domain specificity]] of individual behavior, whereas stability of memes depends on the benefit of their own transmission.&lt;ref name=Sperber2000 /&gt;

With the epidemiology of representations, Sperber has argued that the notion of meaning is disregarded in memetics and that this is questionable since the study of [[society]] and [[culture]] without an explanation of how meaning is perceived and reproduced is contradictory.&lt;ref name=Sperber2000 /&gt; If memetics, nevertheless, attempts to explain culture based on evolutionary biology, it will need to present empirical evidence for the transfer of memes, that is "...showing that elements of culture inherit all or nearly all their [[Relevance theory|relevant]] properties from other elements of culture that they replicate ".&lt;ref name=Sperber2000 /&gt;

Expressionist architecture is one of the three dominant styles of [[Modern architecture]] ([[International Style (architecture)|International Style]], Expressionist- and [[Constructivist architecture]]).

==In the 1920s==

The term "Expressionist architecture" initially described the activity of the German, Dutch, Austrian, Czech and Danish avant garde from 1910 until 1930. Subsequent redefinitions extended the term backwards to 1905 and also widened it to encompass the rest of Europe. Today the meaning has broadened even further to refer to architecture of any date or location that exhibits some of the qualities of the original movement such as; distortion, fragmentation or the communication of violent or overstressed emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Stallybrass and Bullock, p.301–392 – entry by John Willett&lt;/ref&gt;

The style was characterised by an early-[[modernist architecture|modernist]] adoption of novel materials, formal innovation, and very unusual massing, sometimes inspired by natural biomorphic forms, sometimes by the new technical possibilities offered by the mass production of brick, steel and especially glass. Many expressionist architects fought in World War I and their experiences, combined with the political turmoil and social upheaval that followed the [[German Revolution]] of 1919, resulted in a utopian outlook and a romantic socialist agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Jencks, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; Economic conditions severely limited the number of built commissions between 1914 and the mid-1920s,&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in many of the most important expressionist works remaining as projects on paper, such as [[Bruno Taut]]'s ''Alpine Architecture'' and [[Hermann Finsterlin]]'s ''Formspiels''. Ephemeral exhibition buildings were numerous and highly significant during this period. [[Scenography]] for theatre and films provided another outlet for the expressionist imagination,&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.163"&gt;Pehnt, p.163&lt;/ref&gt; and provided supplemental incomes for designers attempting to challenge conventions in a harsh economicate.

Important events in expressionist architecture include; the [[Werkbund Exhibition (1914)]] in [[Cologne]], the completion and theatrical running of the [[Grosses Schauspielhaus]], Berlin in 1919, the [[Glass Chain]] letters, and the activities of the [[Amsterdam School]]. The major permanent extant landmark of Expressionism is [[Erich Mendelsohn]]'s [[Einstein Tower]] in [[Potsdam]]. By 1925 most of the leading architects of Expressionism such as; Bruno Taut, Erich Mendelsohn, [[Walter Gropius]], [[Mies van der Rohe]] and [[Hans Poelzig]], along with other Expressionists in the visual arts, had turned toward the ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' ([[New Objectivity (architecture)|New Objectivity]]) movement, a more practical and matter-of-fact approach which rejected the emotional agitation of expressionism. A few, notably [[Hans Scharoun]], continued to work in an expressionist idiom.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.203"&gt;Pehnt, p.203&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, after the [[Nazi]] seizure of power in Germany, expressionist art was outlawed as [[Degenerate art|degenerate]].&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.203"/&gt; Until the 1970s scholars&lt;ref&gt;Most notably [[Nikolaus Pevsner]]&lt;/ref&gt; commonly played down the influence of the expressionists on the later [[International style (architecture)|International style]], but this has been re-evaluated in recent years.

==Characteristics==

Expressionist architecture was individualistic and in many ways eschewed aesthetic dogma,&lt;ref&gt;Sharp p.166&lt;/ref&gt; but it is still useful to develop some criteria which defines it. Though containing a great variety and differentiation, many points can be found as recurring in works of Expressionist architecture, and are evident in some degree in each of its works.

#Distortion of form for an emotional effect.&lt;ref&gt;Taut, Die Stadtkrone 1919 p.87, quote ''"Architecture is art and ought to be the highest of the arts. It consists exclusively of powerful emotion and addresses itself exclusively to the emotions."''&lt;/ref&gt;
#Subordination of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] to symbolic or stylistic expression of inner experience.
#An underlying effort at achieving the new, original, and visionary.
#Profusion of works on paper, and models, with discovery and representations of [[concept]]s more important than pragmatic finished products.
#Often hybrid solutions, irreducible to a single concept.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.20"&gt;Pehnt, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;
#Themes of natural romantic phenomena, such as caves, mountains, lightning, crystal and rock formations.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.19, Taut's mention of ''"earth-crust architecture"'' and what Poelzig deemed, ''"Important to remodel the earth's surface sculpturally."''&lt;/ref&gt; As such it is more mineral and elemental than florid and organic which characterized its close contemporary [[art nouveau]].
#Uses creative potential of [[artisan]] [[Artisan|craftsmanship]].
#Tendency more towards the [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] than the [[Classical architecture|classical]]. Expressionist architecture also tends more towards the [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] and the [[rococo]] than the classical.
#Though a movement in Europe, expressionism is as [[Eastern world|eastern]] as [[western world|western]]. It draws as much from [[Moorish]], [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]], [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Egyptian]], and [[Indian architecture|Indian]] art and architecture as from [[Roman architecture|Roman]] or [[Architecture of Ancient Greece|Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharp p.119&lt;/ref&gt;
#Conception of architecture as a work of art.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.20"/&gt;

[[File:Taut Glass Pavilion exterior 1914.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Glass Pavilion]] at the [[Cologne]] [[Werkbund Exhibition (1914)|Deutscher Werkbund Exhibition]], 1914 ([[Bruno Taut]])]]

Political, economic and artistic shifts provided a context for the early manifestations of expressionist architecture; particularly in Germany, where the utopian qualities of expressionism found strong resonances with a leftist artistic community keen to provide answers to a society in turmoil during and after the events of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the war, the subsequent removal of [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], the depravations and the rise of social democracy and the optimism of the [[Weimar republic]] created a reluctance amongst architects to pursue projects initiated before the war and provided the impetus to seek new solutions. An influential body of the artistic community, including architects, sought a similar [[October Revolution|revolution]] as had occurred in Russia. The costly and grandiose remodelling of the Grosses Schauspielhaus, was more reminiscent of the imperial past, than wartime budgeting and post-war depression.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.16"&gt;Pehnt, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistic movements that preceded expressionist architecture and continued with some overlap were the [[arts and crafts movement]] and [[art nouveau]] or in Germany, [[jugendstil]]. Unity of designers with artisans, was a major preoccupation of the Arts and Crafts movement which extended into expressionist architecture. The frequent topic of naturalism in art nouveau, which was also prevalent in [[romanticism]], continued as well, but took a turn for the more earthen than floral. The naturalist, [[Ernst Haeckel]] was known by Finsterlin&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.97&lt;/ref&gt; and shared his source of inspiration in natural forms.

The [[Futurist architecture|Futurist]] and [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] architectural movements, and the [[dada]] anti-art movement were occurring concurrently to expressionism and often contained similar features. Bruno Taut's magazine, ''Frülicht'' included constructivist projects, including [[Vladimir Tatlin]]s ''Monument to the Third International''.&lt;ref name="Sharp, p.95"&gt;Sharp, p.95&lt;/ref&gt; However, futurism and constructivism emphasized mechination,&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.110&lt;/ref&gt; and urbanism&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.169&lt;/ref&gt; tendencies which were not to take hold in Germany until the Neue Sachlichkeit. Mendelsohn is an exception whose work bordered on futurism and constructivism. A quality of dynamic energy and exuberance exists in both the sketches of Erich Mendelsohn and futurist [[Antonio Sant'Elia]].&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.119"&gt;Pehnt, p.119&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Merzbau'' by Dada artist [[Kurt Schwitters]], with its angular, abstract form, held many expressionist characteristics.

Influence of individualists such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Antoni Gaudí]] also provided the surrounding context for expressionist architecture. Portfolios of Wright were included in the lectures of Erich Mendelsohn and were well known to those in his circle.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; Gaudí was also both influenced and influencing what was happening in Berlin. In Barcelona, there was no abrupt break between the architecture of art nouveau and that of the early 20th century, where Jugendstil was opposed after 1900, and his work contains more of art nouveau than that of say Bruno Taut. The circle of der Ring, did know about Gaudí, as he was published in Germany, and Finsterlin was in correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] should also be mentioned in the larger context surrounding expressionist architecture. Hard to classify as strictly arts and crafts or art nouveau, buildings such as the [[Hill House, Helensburgh|Hill House]] and his Ingram chairs have an expressionist tinge. His work was known on the continent, as it was exhibited at the [[Vienna Secession]] exhibition in 1900.

==Underlying ideas==

Many writers contributed to the ideology of expressionist architecture. Sources of [[philosophy]] important to expressionist architects were works by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]],&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henri Bergson]].&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; Bruno Taut's sketches were frequently noted with quotations from Nietzsche,&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.41"&gt;Pehnt, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; particularly ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', whose protagonist embodied freedoms dear to the expressionists; freedom to reject the bourgeois world, freedom from history, and strength of spirit in individualist isolation.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.41"/&gt; Zarathustra's mountain retreat was an inspiration to Taut's ''Alpine Architecture''.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; Henri Van de Velde drew a title page illustration for Nietzsche's ''[[Ecce Homo (Nietzsche)|Ecce Homo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The author [[Franz Kafka]] in his ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'', with its shape shifting matched the material instability of expressionist architecture&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalists such as [[Charles Darwin]], and [[Ernst Haeckel]] contributed an ideology for the biomorphic form of architects such as Herman Finsterlin. Poet [[Paul Scheerbart]] worked directly with Bruno Taut and his circle, and contributed ideas based on his poetry of glass architecture.

Emergent [[psychology]] from [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]] was important to expressionism. The exploration of psychological effects of form and space&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.167"&gt;Pehnt, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; was undertaken by architects in their buildings, projects and films. Bruno Taut noted the psychological possibilities of scenographic design that, "Objects serve psychologically to mirror the actors' emotions and gestures."&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.167"/&gt; The exploration of dreams and the unconscious, provided material for the formal investigations of Hermann Finsterlin.

[[File:Caspar David Friedrich - Das Eismeer - Hamburger Kunsthalle - 02.jpg|thumb|left|220px|1824, [[Caspar David Friedrich]]'s "Das Eismeer" ([[The Sea of Ice]])]]
[[File:Monument to the March dead.jpg|thumb|250px|1921, [[Walter Gropius]]'s "Monument to the March Dead" in [[Weimar]] ]]
Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries philosophies of [[aesthetics]] had been developing, particularly through the work of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Schopenhauer]] and notions of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. The experience of the sublime was supposed to involve a self-forgetfulness where personal fear is replaced by a sense of well-being and security when confronted with an object exhibiting superior might. At the end of the nineteenth century the German Kunstwissenschaft, or the "science of art", arose, which was a movement to discern laws of aesthetic appreciation and arrive at a scientific approach to aesthetic experience. At the beginning of the twentieth century Neo-Kantian German philosopher and theorist of aesthetics [[Max Dessoir]] founded the Zeitschift für Ästhetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft, which he edited for many years, and published the work Ästhetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft in which he formulated five primary aesthetic forms: the beautiful, the sublime, the tragic, the ugly, and the comic. Iain Boyd Whyte writes that whilst "the Expressionist visionaries did not keep copies of Kant under their drawing boards. There was, however, in the first decades of this century [20th] a climate of ideas that was sympathetic to the aesthetic concerns and artistic production of [[romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Benson, p118&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistic theories of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], such as ''[[Concerning the Spiritual in Art]]'', and ''Point and Line to Plane'' were centerpieces of expressionist thinking.&lt;ref name="Sharp, p.18"&gt;Sharp, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==

A recurring concern of expressionist architects was the use of materials and how they might be poetically expressed. Often, the intention was to unify the materials in a building so as to make it [[monolith]]ic. The collaboration of Bruno Taut and the utopian poet Paul Scheerbart attempted to address the problems of German society by a doctrine of glass architecture. Such utopianism can be seen in the context of a revolutionary Germany where the tussle between nationalism and socialism had yet to resolve itself. Taut and Scheerbart imagined a society that had freed itself by breaking from past forms and traditions, impelled by an architecture that flooded every building with multicolored light and represented a more promising future.&lt;ref&gt;Benson p.100&lt;/ref&gt; They published texts on this subject and built the Glass Pavilion at the 1914 Werkbund exhibition. Inscribed around the base of the dome were aphoristic sayings about the material, penned by Scheerbart.
:''"Coloured glass destroys hatred","Without a glass palace life is a burden","Glass brings us a new era, building in brick only does us harm"'' – Paul Scheerbart, inscriptions on the 1914 Werkbund Glass Pavilion.&lt;ref name="Sharp, p.95"/&gt;
Another example of expressionist use of monolithic materials was by Erich Mendelsohn at the Einstein Tower. Not to be missed was a pun on the towers namesake, ''Einstein'', and an attempt to make the building out of one stone, ''Ein stein''.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.121&lt;/ref&gt; Though not cast in one pour of concrete (due to technical difficulties, brick and stucco were used partially) the effect of the building is an expression of the fluidity of concrete before it is cast. 'Architecture of Steel and Concrete' was the title of a 1919 exhibition of Mendelsohn's sketches at Paul Cassirer's gallery in Berlin.

Brick was used in a similar fashion to express the inherent nature of the material. [[Josef Franke]] produced some characteristic expressionist churches in the [[Ruhrgebiet]] in the 1920s. Bruno Taut used brick as a way to show mass and repetition in his Berlin Housing Estate "Legien-Stadt". In the same way as their Arts and Crafts movement predecessors, to expressionist architects, populism, naturalism, and according to Pehnt ''"Moral and sometimes even irrational arguments were adduced in favor of building in brick"''.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.127&lt;/ref&gt; With its color and pointillist like visual increment, brick became to expressionism what stucco later became to the international style.

==Theatres, films, paintings and magazines==

[[File:CABINET DES DR CALIGARI 01.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An example of expressionist architecture in the film set for ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920 film)|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]''.]]

Europe witnessed a boom in [[Theatre|theatrical]] production in the early twentieth century. In 1896 there were 302 permanent theatres in Europe, by 1926 there were 2,499.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.16"/&gt; [[Film|Cinema]] witnessed a comparable increase in its use and popularity and a resulting increase in the number of picture houses. It was also able to provide a temporary reality for innovative architectural ideas.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.167"/&gt;

Many architects designed theatres for performances on the stage and film sets for [[German Expressionism|expressionist films]]. These were defining moments for the movement, and with its interest in theatres and films, the [[performing arts]] held a significant place in expressionist architecture. Like film, and theatre, expressionist architecture created an unusual and exotic environment to surround the visitor.

Built examples of expressionist theatres include [[Henry van de Velde]]'s construction of the model theatre for the 1914 Werkbund Exhibition, and [[Hans Poelzig]]'s grand remodelling of the Grosses Schauspielhaus. The enormous capacity of the Grosses Schauspielhaus enabled low ticket prices, and the creation of a "people's theatre".&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.16"/&gt; Not only were expressionist architects building stages, Bruno Taut wrote a play intended for the theatre, ''Weltbaumeister''.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.163"/&gt;

Expressionist architects were both involved in film and inspired by it. Hans Poelzig strove to make films based on [[legend]]s or [[fairy tale]]s.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.164"&gt;Pehnt, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; Poelzig designed scenographic sets for [[Paul Wegener]]'s 1920 film ''[[The Golem: How He Came into the World|Der Golem]]''. Space in ''Der Golem'' was a three-dimensional village, a lifelike rendering of the Jewish ghetto of Prague. This contrasts with the setting of the ''Cabinet of Doctor Caligari'', which was painted on canvas backdrops.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the latter was able to achieve more stylistic freedom, but Poelzig in ''Der Golem'' was able to create a whole village that "spoke with a Jewish accent."&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.164"/&gt;

Herman Finsterlin approached [[Fritz Lang]] with an idea for a film.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.163"/&gt; Fritz Lang's film [[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]] demonstrates a visually progressive 'Futurist' society dealing with relevant issues of 1920s Germany in relation to labour and society. Bruno Taut designed an unbuilt theatre for reclining cinema-goers.&lt;ref&gt;Pehnt, p.168&lt;/ref&gt; Bruno Taut also proposed a film as an anthology for the Glass Chain, entitled ''Die Galoschen des Glücks''(The Galoshes of Fortune) with a name borrowed from [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. On the film, Taut noted, "an expressionism of the most subtle kind will bring surroundings, props and action into harmony with one another".&lt;ref&gt;Taut, ''Die Gläserne Kette'', p.49&lt;/ref&gt; It featured architectural fantasias suited to each member of the Chain.&lt;ref name="Pehnt, p.163"/&gt; Ultimately unproduced, it reveals the aspiration that the new medium, film, invoked.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Abstraction==

The tendency towards abstraction in art corresponded with abstraction in architecture. Publication of ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art'' in 1912 by [[Wassily Kandinsky]], his first advocacy of abstraction while still involved in [[Der Blaue Reiter]] phaze, marks a beginning of abstraction in expressionism and abstraction in expressionist architecture.&lt;ref name="Sharp, p.18"/&gt; The conception of the Einstein Tower by Erich Mendelson was not far behind Kandinsky, in advancing abstraction in architecture. By the publication of Kandinsky's ''Point and Line to Plane'' in 1926 a rigorous and more geometric form of abstraction emerged, and Kandinsky's work took on clearer and drafted lines. The trends in architecture are not dissimilar, as the Bauhaus was gaining attention and expressionist architecture was giving way to the geometric abstractions of modern architecture.

==Brick Expressionism==
{{main|Brick Expressionism}}
[[File:Chilehaus - Hamburg.jpg|thumb|235px|[[Chilehaus]] in [[Hamburg]], 1923 ([[Fritz Höger]]) ]]
The term '''Brick Expressionism''' ({{lang-de|Backsteinexpressionismus}}) describes a specific variant of expressionism that uses [[brick]]s, [[tile]]s or [[clinker brick]]s as the main visible building material. Buildings in the style were erected mostly in the 1920s. The style's regional centres were the larger cities of [[Northern Germany]] and the [[Ruhr area]], but the [[Amsterdam School]] belongs to the same category.

Amsterdam's 1912 cooperative-commercial [[Scheepvaarthuis]] (Shipping House) is considered the starting point and prototype for Amsterdam School work: brick construction with complicated masonry, traditional massing, and the integration of an elaborate scheme of building elements (decorative masonry, art glass, wrought-iron work, and exterior figurative sculpture) that embodies and expresses the identity of the building. The School flourished until about 1925.

The great international fame of German Expressionism is not related to the German Brick Expressionist architects, but to the German Expressionist painters of the two groups "[[Die Brücke]]" in [[Dresden]] since 1905 ([[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner|Kirchner]], [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff|Schmidt-Rottluff]], [[Erich Heckel|Heckel]], [[Emil Nolde|Nolde]],...) and "[[Der Blaue Reiter]]" in [[Munich]] since 1912 ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc|Marc]], [[August Macke|Macke]], [[Gabriele Münter|Münter]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky|Jawlensky]],...).

==Legacy==

The legacy of expressionist architecture extended to later movements in the twentieth century. It had an influence on its immediate successor, modern architecture, as well as Art Deco. The [[New Objectivity|new objectivity]] (''Neue Sachlichkeit'') art movement arose in direct opposition to expressionism. Expressionistic architecture today is an evident influence in [[deconstructivism]], the work of [[Santiago Calatrava]], and the organic movement of [[blobitecture]].

Another movement that grew out of expressionism to become a school in its own right is [[Metaphoric architecture]] which includes elements of [[biomorphism]] and [[Zoomorphic architecture]].  The style is very much influenced by the form and geometry of the natural world and is characterised by the use of analogy and metaphor as the primary inspiration and directive for design.&lt;ref name=metaphor&gt;

Many of the founders and significant players in expressionist architecture were also important in modern architecture. Examples are Bruno Taut, Hans Scharoun, Walter Gropius, and Mies Van der Rohe. By 1927 Gropius, Taut, Scharoun and Mies were all building in the [[International style (architecture)|international style]] and participated in the Weissenhof Estate. Gropius and Mies are better known for their modernist work, but Gropius' Monument to the March Dead, and Mies' Friedrichstrasse office building projects are basic works of expressionist architecture. Le Corbusier started his career in modern architecture but took a turn for a more expressionist manner later in life.

===Art Deco===
{{Main|Art Deco}}
First identified at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes]] in 1925, [[art deco]] shares some characteristics of expressionism and is likely to have been influenced directly by the Expressionist movement – particularly the activities of the Weimar Bauhaus – and more generally with the factors and politics that influenced both movements at the time, such as socialism and mechanisation. In common with [[art nouveau]] and expressionism they are interested in decorative effects that break with the past and reflect a new modernity. The bold use of zigzag and stepped forms, and sweeping curves and chevron patterns. New materials are employed in new ways such as glass, aluminum, and stainless steel. Later examples of Art Deco, particularly in [[New York City]] can be seen as a Transatlantic equivalent of European expressionism.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Expressionism since the 1950s===
The influential architectural critic and historian, [[Sigfried Giedion]] in his book ''Space, Time and Architecture'' (1941) dismissed Expressionist architecture as a side show in the development of [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]]. In the middle of the twentieth century, in the 50s and 60s, many architects began designing in a manner reminiscent of expressionist architecture. In this post war period, a variant of expressionism [[brutalist architecture|brutalism]] had an honest approach to materials, that in its unadorned use of concrete, was similar to the use of brick by the Amsterdam School. The designs of [[Le Corbusier]] took a turn for the expressionist in his brutalist phase, but more so in his [[Notre Dame du Haut]]. In Mexico, in 1953, German émigré [[Mathias Goeritz]], published the "Arquitectura Emocional" (Emotional architecture) manifesto where he declared that "architecture's principal function is emotion."&lt;ref&gt;Mathias Goeritz, "El manifiesto de arquitectura emocional", in Lily Kassner, Mathias Goeritz, UNAM, 2007, p. 272–273&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Mexican architect [[Luis Barragán]] adopted the term that influenced his work. The two of them collaborated in the project [[Torres de Satélite]] (1957–58) guided by Goeritz's principles of Arquitectura Emocional. Another mid-century modern architect to evoke expressionism was [[Eero Saarinen]]. A similar aesthetic can be found in later buildings such as [[Eero Saarinen]]'s 1962 [[TWA Flight Center|TWA Terminal]] at [[JFK International Airport]]. His TWA Terminal at JFK International Airport has an organic form, as close to Herman Finsterlin's ''Formspiels'' as any other, save [[Jørn Utzon]]'s [[Sydney Opera House]]. It was only in the 1970s that expressionism in architecture came to be re-evaluated in a more positive light. More recently{{when|date=January 2011}} still, the aesthetics and tactility of expressionist architecture have found echo in the works of [[Enric Miralles]], most notability his [[Scottish Parliament building]], [[deconstructivist]] architects such as [[Zaha Hadid]] and [[Daniel Libeskind]], as well as [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canadian Aboriginal]] architect [[Douglas Cardinal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0001394|title=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadacouncil.ca/prizes/ggavma/xh127240204281875000.htm?subsiteurl=%2Fcanadacouncil%2Farchives%2Fprizes%2Fggvma%2F2001%2F2001-01-e.asp|title=The Canada Council for the Arts|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203103759/http://www.canadacouncil.ca/prizes/ggavma/xh127240204281875000.htm?subsiteurl=%2Fcanadacouncil%2Farchives%2Fprizes%2Fggvma%2F2001%2F2001-01-e.asp|archivedate=3 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==

===[[1900 in architecture|1900]]===

*Reactions to [[Art Nouveau]] impelled partly by moral yearnings for a sterner and more unadorned style and in part by rationalist ideas requiring practical justification for formal effects.

[[File:WendingenLauweriks.jpg|thumb|[[Wendingen|WENDINGEN]] 1918–1931, Dutch architecture and art magazine. Main theme: Expressionist architecture ([[Amsterdam School]], [[Michel de Klerk|de Klerk]], [[Piet Kramer|Kramer]], [[Erich Mendelsohn|Mendelsohn]], [[Hermann Finsterlin|Finsterlin]], [[Lyonel Feininger|Feininger]] et al.). Movement against "[[De Stijl]]" (Cubist architecture) in 1917.]] 
*Paul Scheerbart publishes ''Glasarchitecktur''
*[[Werkbund Exhibition (1914)|Cologne Werkbund exhibition]] demonstrates ideological split between:

*Free expression of the [[Amsterdam School]] elucidated in the [[Wendingen]] (Changes) magazine.
*November – [[Arbeitsrat für Kunst]] (Worker's Council for the Arts), founded by [[Bruno Taut]] and [[Adolf Behne]]. They model themselves consciously on the Soviets and attach a leftist programme to their Utopian and Expressionist activities. They demand; 1. A spiritual revolution to accompany the political one. 2. Architects to form ‘Corporations’ bound by ‘mutual aid’.
*November – [[Novembergruppe]] formed only to merge with [[Arbeitsrat für Kunst]] the following month. It proclaims; 1. Creation of collective art works. 2. Mass housing. 3. The destruction of artistically valueless monuments (This was a common reaction of the Avant Garde against the elitist militarism that was perceived as the cause of World War I).
*December – [[Arbeitsrat für Kunst]] declares its basic aims in [[Bruno Taut]]s ''Architeckturprogramm''. It calls for a new 'total work of art', to be created with active participation of the people.
*Bruno Taut publishes [[Die Stadtkrone]].

'''&lt;big&gt;[[1919 in architecture|1919]]&lt;/big&gt;'''

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Vorgeschichte feininger.jpg|thumb|Woodblock 'Cathedral by [[Lyonel Feininger]], used as front cover for the 1919 [[Bauhaus]] manifesto]] --&gt;
*Spring manifesto of [[Arbeitsrat für Kunst]] is published. Art for the masses. Alliance of the arts under the wing of architecture. 50 artists, architects and patrons join led by [[Bruno Taut]], [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Adolf Behne]].
*April – [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Hannes Meyer]], [[Bernard Hoetger]], [[Max Taut]] and [[Otto Bartning]] stage exhibition called 'An Exhibition of Unknown Architects'. [[Walter Gropius]] writes the introduction, now considered to be a first draft for the [[Bauhaus]] programme published later in the month. Called for a ‘Cathedral of the Future’, to unify the creative energy of society as in the Middle Ages.
*[[Bauhaus]] established and begins expressionist phase, to last until 1923.
*[[Adolf Behne]] publishes ''Ja! Stimmen des Arbeitsrates für Kunst in Berlin'' (''Yes! Voices from the art Soviet in Berlin'').
*[[Spartacist revolt]] ends the overt activities of [[Arbeitsrat für Kunst]]. The group starts the first [[Utopian]] letter of the [[Glass Chain]] by Bruno Taut. They are joined by previously peripheral architects; [[Hans Luckhardt]], [[Wassili Luckhardt]] and [[Hans Scharoun]]. The letters demand; 1. Return to medieval integration of the building team. 2. Irregular form. 3. Facetted form. 4. Glass monuments.
*Opening of the [[Grosses Schauspielhaus]] by Hans Poelzig in Berlin. Hanging pendentive forms create a ‘luminous dissolution of form and space’.
*[[Bruno Taut]] launches the magazine [[Frühlicht]] (Early Light).
*[[Bruno Taut]] and [[Hans Scharoun]] stress the creative importance of the [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]].
*[[Hans Poelzig]] is made chairman of the [[Deutscher Werkbund]].
*Design work starts on [[Piet Kramer]]s [[De Dageraad]]. Construction is completed in 1923. Mendelsohn see it as more structural than the work of [[Hendrikus Theodorus Wijdeveld|Hendrikus Wijdeveld]].

===[[1920 in architecture|1920]]===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Friedrichstrasse Mies.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]'s Friedrichstraße Skyscraper Project, Berlin-Mitte, 1921]] --&gt;
*February 26, the film [[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920 film)|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]] premiered at the [[Marmorhaus]] in Berlin.
*[[Hans Poelzig]] declares affinity with the Glass Chain. He designs sets for [[The Golem: How He Came Into the World|The Golem]].
*Solidarity of the Glass Chain is broken. Final letter written by [[Hermann Finsterlin]]. Hans Luckhardt recognises the incompatibility of free unconscious form and rationalist prefabrication and moves to [[Rationalism]].
*Taut maintains his Scheerbartian views. He publishes ‘Die Auflösung der Städt' (The dissolution of the city) in line with [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]]ian anarchist socialist tendencies. In common with the [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]]s, it recommends the breakup of cities and a return to the land. He models agrarian communities and temples in the Alps. There would be 3 separate residential communities. 1. The enlightened. 2. Artists. 3. Children. This authoritarianism is noted in Frampton as although socialist in intent, paradoxically containing the seeds of the later fascism.

'''&lt;big&gt;[[1921 in architecture|1921]]&lt;/big&gt;'''
[[File:Chilehaus.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Chilehaus]] in [[Hamburg]], 1923 ([[Fritz Höger]]) ]]
[[File:Wendingen1924-9-10p27deKlerk.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Clubhouse in [[Amsterdam]] 1923 ([[Michel de Klerk]]) ]]

[[File:Amsterdam PL Tak Complex.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Amsterdam]], [[Plan Zuid]], PL-Takstraat, 1923. "Amsterdam, Mecca of Social Housing" ]]
*Taut is made city architect of [[Magdeburg]] and fails to realise a municipal exhibition hall as the harsh economic realities of the [[Weimar republic]] become apparent and prospects of building a ‘glass paradise’ dwindle.
*[[Walter Gropius]] designs the ''Monument to the March Dead''[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/1526381043320796;jsessionid=n_5xJRMLsgMegIOfxT] in [[Weimar]]. It is completed in 1922 and inspires the workers' gong in the 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' by [[Fritz Lang]].
*[[Frülicht]] loses its impetus.
*[[Erich Mendelsohn]] visits works of the Dutch [[Wendingen]] group and tours the Netherlands. He meets the rationalists [[Jacobus Johannes Pieter Oud|JJP Oud]] and [[W M Dudek]]. He recognises the conflict of visionary and objective approaches to design.
*[[Erich Mendelsohn]]'s [[Mossehaus]] opens. Construction is complete on the [[Einstein Tower]]. It combines the sculptural forms of Van de Weldes Werkbund Exhibition theatre with the profile of Taut's Glashaus and the formal affinity to vernacular Dutch architecture of [[Eibink]] and [[Jan Snellebrand|Snellebrand]] and [[Hendrikus Theodorus Wijdeveld|Hendrikus Wijdeveld]]. Einstein himself visits and declares it ‘organic’.
*Mendelsohn designs a hat factory in [[Luckenwalde]]. It shows influences of the Dutch expressionist [[De Klerk]], setting dramatic tall pitched industrial forms against horizontal administrative elements. This approach is echoed in his [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] textile mill of 1925 and anticipates the banding in his department stores in [[Breslau]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Chemnitz]] and Berlin from 1927 and 1931.
*[[Hugo Häring]] and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] submit a competition entry for a Friedrichstrasse office building. It reveals an organic approach to structure and is fully made of glass.

'''&lt;big&gt;[[1922 in architecture|1922]]&lt;/big&gt;'''
*[[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] publishes a glass skyscraper project in the last issue of [[Frülicht]].
*[[Toompea Castle]] is rebuilt for the [[Riigikogu]] in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]], as the only expressionist style parliamentary building in the world.
*The film ''[[Nosferatu]]'' by [[F.W. Murnau]] is released.

'''&lt;big&gt;[[1923 in architecture|1923]]&lt;/big&gt;'''
*[[Bauhaus]] expressionist phase ends. Standard arguments for the reasons for this are 1. Expressionism was difficult to build. 2. Rampant inflation in Germany changed the climate of opinion to a more sober one. Jencks postulates that the standard arguments are too simplistic and instead argues that 1. Expressionism had become associated with extreme utopianism which in turn had been discredited by violence and bloodshed. Or 2. Architects had become convinced that the new (rationalist) style was equally expressive and more adequately captured the [[Zeitgeist]]. There is no large disagreements or public pronouncements to precipitate this change in direction. The only outwardly visible reaction was the forced resignation of the head of the basic Bauhaus course, [[Johannes Itten]], to be replaced with the, then constructivist, [[László Moholy-Nagy]].
*[[Chilehaus]] in Hamburg by [[Fritz Höger]].
*[[Walter Gropius]] abandons expressionism and moves to rationalism.
*Bruno and Max Taut begin work on government funded low cost housing projects.
*[[Berlin secession exhibition]]. Mies van der Rohe and Hans and Wassili Luckhardt demonstrate a more functional and objective approach.
*[[Rudolf Steiner]] designs second [[Goetheanum]] after first was destroyed by fire in 1922. Work commences 1924 and is completed in 1928.
*[[Michel de Klerk]] dies.

'''&lt;big&gt;[[1924 in architecture|1924]]&lt;/big&gt;'''
[[File:Den Haag De Bijenkorf 001.JPG|thumb|right|160px|[[De Bijenkorf]] in [[The Hague]], 1926 ([[Piet Kramer]]) ]]
*Germany adopts the [[Dawes plan]]. Architects more inclined to produce low-cost housing than pursue utopian ideas about glass.
*[[Hugo Häring]] designs a farm complex. It uses expressive pitched roofs contrasted with bulky tectonic elements and rounded corners.
*[[Hugo Häring]] designs [[Prinz Albrecht Garten]], residential project. Whilst demonstrating overt expressionism he is preoccupied with deeper inquiries into the inner source of form.
*Foundation of [[Zehnerring]] group.
*June 3, Death of Franz Kafka.
*Hermann Finsterlin initiates a series of correspondence with [[Antoni Gaudí]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.archinform.net/arch/2543.htm|title=Hermann Finsterlin|first=archINFORM – Sascha|last=Hendel|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Borsigwerke B-Tegel 07-2017 img3.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Borsig-Tower in [[Tegel|Berlin-Tegel]], 1925 (Eugen Schmohl) ]]
*[[Hans Poelzig]] abandons expressionism and returns to crypto-classicism.
* [[Zehnerring]] group becomes [[Der Ring]]. [[Hugo Häring]] is appointed secretary.
* [[Max Brod]] publishes Franz Kafka's ''[[The Trial]]''
* Eugen Schmohl completes the Borsig-Tower in Berlin-Tegel

'''&lt;big&gt;[[1926 in architecture|1926]]&lt;/big&gt;'''
*Founding of the architectural collective [[Der Ring]] largely turns its back on expressionism and towards a more functionalist agenda.
*Wassily Kandinsky publishes ''Point and Line to Plane''.
*Max Brod publishes Franz Kafka's ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]''

'''&lt;big&gt;[[1927 in architecture|1927]]&lt;/big&gt;'''

*Release of [[Fritz Lang]]'s [[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]].
*[[Weissenhof Estate]] is built in [[Stuttgart]]. Expressionist architects, Taut, Poelzig, Scharoun, build in [[International style (architecture)|international style]].

'''&lt;big&gt;[[1928 in architecture|1928]]&lt;/big&gt;'''
*[[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM) convenes in Switzerland. [[Hugo Häring]] fails to move consensus away from [[Le Corbusier]]'s call for rationalism towards an organic approach. Finally the Scheerbartian vision is eclipsed as the non-normative ‘place’ orientated approach is cast aside.
*The [[Großmarkthalle]] at [[Frankfurt]] (by [[Martin Elsaesser]]) is completed.
*Chapel of the Cemetery of [[Glienicke/Nordbahn]] (Germany) is completed. Architect: Paul Poser

===[[1930 in architecture|1930]]===

===[[1940 in architecture|1940]]===
*The [[Berlin Philharmonic]] concert hall is destroyed in 1944 during World War II.

===[[1950 in architecture|1950]]===
*Le Corbusier constructs [[Notre Dame du Haut]] signaling his [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]] return to an architectural expressionism of form. He also constructs the [[Unité d'Habitation]], which emphasizes the architectural expression of materials. The [[brutalist architecture|brutalist]] use of [[béton brut]] (reinforced concrete) recalls the expressionist use of glass, [[brick]], and [[steel]].

===[[1960 in architecture|1960]]===
*Expressionism reborn without the political context as [[Fantastic architecture]].
*Rebuilding of the Berlin Philharmonic in 1963 by Hans Scharoun.

The '''Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope''' ('''FGST'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fgst.slac.stanford.edu/ |title=FGST: Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope |publisher=Stanford}}&lt;/ref&gt;), formerly called the '''Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope''' ('''GLAST'''), is a [[space observatory]] being used to perform [[gamma-ray astronomy]] observations from [[low Earth orbit]]. Its main instrument is the Large Area Telescope (LAT), with which astronomers mostly intend to perform an all-sky survey studying [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] and [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] phenomena such as [[active galactic nuclei]], [[pulsar]]s, other high-energy sources and [[dark matter]]. Another instrument aboard Fermi, the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM; formerly GLAST Burst Monitor), is being used to study [[gamma-ray burst]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/glast_gbm.html |title=NASA's GLAST Burst Monitor Team Hard at Work Fine-Tuning Instrument and Operations |publisher=NASA |date=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fermi was launched on 11 June 2008 at 16:05&amp;nbsp;[[UTC]] aboard a [[Delta II]] 7920-H rocket. The mission is a joint venture of [[NASA]], the [[United States Department of Energy]], and government agencies in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-glast.stanford.edu/ |title=An Astro-Particle Physics Partnership Exploring the High Energy Universe - List of funders |publisher=SLAC |accessdate=9 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the most sensitive gamma-ray telescope on orbit, succeeding [[INTEGRAL]].

== Overview ==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
Fermi includes two scientific instruments, the Large Area Telescope (LAT) and the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM).

[[General Dynamics]] Advanced Information Systems (formerly Spectrum Astro and now [[Orbital Sciences]]) in [[Gilbert, Arizona]], designed and built the [[spacecraft]] that carries the instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/library/conferences/lat_oct02/DConte.pdf |title=Spacecraft Overview Presentation for the GLAST LAT Collaboration Meeting |publisher=NASA |date=23 October 2002 |id=1196-EB-R43864}}&lt;/ref&gt; It travels in a low, circular orbit with a period of about 95&amp;nbsp;minutes. Its normal mode of operation maintains its orientation so that the instruments will look away from the Earth, with a "rocking" motion to equalize the coverage of the sky. The view of the instruments will sweep out across most of the sky about 16 times per day. The spacecraft can also maintain an orientation that points to a chosen target.

Both science instruments underwent environmental testing, including vibration, vacuum, and high and low temperatures to ensure that they can withstand the stresses of launch and continue to operate in space. They were integrated with the spacecraft at the General Dynamics ASCENT facility in Gilbert, Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.gd.com/news/press-releases/2008/06/nasas-general-dynamics-built-glast-satellite-launched-today |title=NASA's General Dynamics-Built GLAST Satellite Launched Today |publisher=General Dynamics |first=Carol |last=Smith |date=10 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data from the instruments are available to the public through the Fermi Science Support Center web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/ |title=Currently Available Data Products |work=Fermi Science Support Center |publisher=NASA |accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software for analyzing the data is also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/ |title=Data Analysis |work=Fermi Science Support Center |publisher=NASA |accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GLAST renamed Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope ==
Fermi gained its new name in 2008: On 26 August 2008, GLAST was renamed the "Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope" in honor of [[Enrico Fermi]], a pioneer in high-energy physics.&lt;ref name=firstlight&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/26aug_firstlight.htm |title=First Light for the Fermi Space Telescope |publisher=NASA |date=26 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317001936/http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/26aug_firstlight.htm |archivedate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA's [[Alan Stern]], associate administrator for Science at NASA Headquarters, launched a public competition 7 February 2008, closing 31 March 2008, to rename GLAST in a way that would "capture the excitement of GLAST's mission and call attention to gamma-ray and high-energy astronomy&amp;nbsp;... something memorable to commemorate this spectacular new astronomy mission&amp;nbsp;... a name that is catchy, easy to say and will help make the satellite and its mission a topic of dinner table and classroom discussion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/feb/HQ_08036_GLAST.html |title=NASA Calls for Suggestions to Re-Name Future Telescope Mission |publisher=NASA |date=7 February 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/08feb_namethattelescope.htm |title=Name that Space Telescope! |date=8 February 2008 |publisher=NASA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402005128/http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/08feb_namethattelescope.htm |archivedate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GLASTtimeline.png|thumb|Anticipated first year of operations timeline]]

NASA designed the mission with a five-year lifetime, with a goal of ten years of operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://glast.gsfc.nasa.gov/public/ |title=The GLAST Mission: GLAST Overview, mission length |publisher=NASA |accessdate=9 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key scientific objectives of the Fermi mission have been described as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-glast.stanford.edu/mission.html |title=The Mission |publisher=SLAC |accessdate=9 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To understand the mechanisms of particle acceleration in [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] (AGN), pulsars, and [[supernova remnants]] (SNR).
* Resolve the [[gamma-ray]] sky: unidentified sources and diffuse emission.
* Determine the high-energy behavior of [[gamma-ray bursts]] and transients.
* Probe dark matter (e.g. by looking for an excess of gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way) and early Universe.
* Search for evaporating primordial [[micro black holes]] ([[Micro black hole|MBH]]) from their presumed gamma burst signatures (Hawking Radiation component).

The [[National Academies of Sciences]] ranked this mission as a top priority.&lt;ref name="GlastQ&amp;A"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/main/questions_answers.html |title=NASA - Q&amp;A on the GLAST Mission |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=28 August 2008 |accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many new possibilities and discoveries are anticipated to emerge from this single mission and greatly expand our view of the [[Universe]].&lt;ref name="GlastQ&amp;A" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/science/index.html NASA - Fermi Science] and [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/science/unidentified_sources.html NASA - Scientists Predict Major Discoveries for GLAST].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- The following list is abbreviated as discoveries are made --&gt;

=== Prelaunch ===
On 4 March 2008, the spacecraft arrived at the [[Astrotech]] payload processing facility in [[Titusville, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/news/releases/2008/release-20080304.html |title=GLAST Spacecraft Arrives in Florida to Prepare for Launch |publisher=NASA |first1=George |last1=Diller |first2=Rob |last2=Gutro |date=4 March 2008 |id=04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 June 2008, after several previous delays, launch status was retargeted for 11 June at the earliest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/tracking/index.html |title=Tracking Station — Worldwide launch schedule |work=Spaceflight Now |accessdate=4 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qF7qFllk?url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/tracking/index.html |archivedate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/main/index.html |title=GLAST Mission: Coverage Latest News |accessdate=4 June 2008 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the last delays resulting from the need to replace the Flight Termination System batteries.&lt;ref name=06-06staus&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/launchingrockets/status/2008/elvstatus-20080606.html |title=Expendable Launch Vehicle Status Report: ELV-060608 |publisher=NASA |first=George |last=Diller |date=6 June 2008 |accessdate=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch window extended from 15:45 to 17:40&amp;nbsp;UTC daily, until 7 August 2008.&lt;ref name=06-06staus/&gt;

=== Launch ===
Launch occurred successfully on 11 June 2008 at 16:05&amp;nbsp;UTC aboard a [[Delta II|Delta 7920H-10C]] rocket from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Space Launch Complex 17-B]]. Spacecraft separation took place about 75 minutes after launch.

=== Orbit ===
Fermi resides in a [[Low Earth orbit|low-Earth circular orbit]] at an altitude of {{convert|550|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and at an inclination of 28.5 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://glast.gsfc.nasa.gov/public/ |title=The GLAST Mission: GLAST Overview, orbital information |publisher=NASA |accessdate=9 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software modifications ===
GLAST received some minor modifications to its computer software on 23 June 2008.

=== LAT/GBM computers operational ===
Computers operating both the LAT and GBM and most of the LAT's components were turned on 24 June 2008. The LAT high voltage was turned on 25 June, and it began detecting high-energy particles from space, but minor adjustments were still needed to calibrate the instrument. The GBM high voltage was also turned on 25 June, but the GBM still required one more week of testing/calibrations before searching for gamma-ray bursts.

=== Sky survey mode ===
After presenting an overview of the Fermi instrumentation and goals, Jennifer Carson of [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]] had concluded that the primary goals were "all achievable with the all-sky scanning mode of observing".&lt;ref name=carson&gt;{{cite journal |title=GLAST: physics goals and instrument status |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |last=Carson |first=Jennifer |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=115–118 |date=March 2007 |arxiv=astro-ph/0610960 |bibcode=2007JPhCS..60..115C |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/60/1/020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermi switched to "sky survey mode" on 26 June 2008 so as to begin sweeping its field of view over the entire sky every three hours (every two orbits).

=== Collision avoided ===
On 30 April 2013, NASA revealed that the telescope had narrowly avoided a collision a year earlier with a defunct Cold War-era Soviet spy satellite, [[Kosmos 1805]], in April 2012. Orbital predictions several days earlier indicated that the two satellites were expected to occupy the same point in space within 30 milliseconds of each other. On 3 April, telescope operators decided to stow the satellite's high-gain parabolic antenna, rotate the solar panels out of the way and to fire Fermi's rocket thrusters for one second to move it out of the way. Even though the thrusters had been idle since the telescope had been placed in orbit nearly five years earlier, they worked correctly and potential disaster was thus avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/bullet-dodge.html |title=The Day NASA's Fermi Dodged a 1.5-ton Bullet |publisher=NASA |date=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extended mission 2013-2018 ===
In August 2013 Fermi started its 5-year mission extension.&lt;ref name=fme2013&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasas-fermi-celebrates-five-years-in-space-enters-extended-mission/ |title=NASA's Fermi Celebrates Five Years in Space, Enters Extended Mission |publisher=NASA |first=Francis |last=Reddy |date=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar array drive failure ===
On 16 March 2018 one of Fermi's solar arrays quit rotating, prompting a transition to "safe hold" mode and instrument power off.  This was the first mechanical failure in nearly 10 years. Fermi's solar arrays rotate to maximize the exposure of the arrays to the Sun. The motor that drives that rotation failed to move as instructed in one direction. On 27 March, the satellite was placed at a fixed angle relative to its orbit to maximize solar power. The next day the GBM instrument was turned back on. On 2 April, operators turned LAT on and it resumed operations on 8 April. Alternate observation strategies are being developed due to power and thermal requirements.&lt;ref name=20180530nasa&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/fermi-status-update |title=Fermi Status Update |publisher=NASA |first=Felicia |last=Chou |date=30 May 2018 |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discoveries ==
[[Image:Cycle of pulsed gamma rays from the Vela pulsar HI RES.gif|thumb|Cycle of pulsed gamma rays from the [[Vela pulsar]], constructed from photons detected by LAT]]

=== Pulsar discovery ===
The first major discovery came when the space telescope detected a [[pulsar]] in the CTA 1 [[supernova]] remnant that appeared to emit radiation in the [[gamma ray]] bands only, a first for its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.universetoday.com/19879/fermi-telescope-makes-first-big-discovery-gamma-ray-pulsar/ |title=Fermi Telescope Makes First Big Discovery: Gamma Ray Pulsar |work=[[Universe Today]] |first=Nancy |last=Atkinson |date=17 October 2008 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new pulsar sweeps the Earth every 316.86 milliseconds and is about 4,600 light years away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cosmosmagazine.com/news/2260/new-kind-pulsar-discovered |title=New kind of pulsar discovered |work=[[Cosmos (magazine)|Cosmos]] |date=18 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211043148/http://cosmosmagazine.com/news/2260/new-kind-pulsar-discovered |archivedate=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greatest GRB energy release ===
In September 2008, the gamma-ray burst [[GRB 080916C]] in the constellation [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] was recorded by the Fermi telescope. This burst is notable as having "the largest apparent energy release yet measured".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fermi Observations of High-Energy Gamma-Ray Emission from GRB 080916C |journal=Science |first=A. A. |last=Abdo |display-authors=etal |volume=323 |issue=5922 |pages=1688–1693 |date=March 2009 |doi=10.1126/science.1169101 |bibcode=2009Sci...323.1688A |pmid=19228997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The explosion had the power of about 9,000 ordinary supernovae, and the [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] jet of material ejected in the blast must have moved at a minimum of 99.9999% the [[speed of light]]. Overall, GRB 080916C had "the greatest total energy, the fastest motions, and the highest initial-energy emissions" ever seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090219141458.htm |title=Most Extreme Gamma-ray Blast Ever, Seen By Fermi Gamma-ray Telescope |work=Science Daily |date=19 February 2009 |accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmic rays and supernova remnants ===
In February 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/cosmic-rays-source.html |title=NASA's Fermi Closes on Source of Cosmic Rays |publisher=NASA |first=Francis |last=Reddy |date=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was announced that Fermi-LAT had determined that [[supernova remnant]]s act as enormous accelerators for [[Cosmic ray|cosmic particles]].

In March 2010 it was announced that [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] are not responsible for most gamma-ray background radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/news/gamma-ray-dragons.html |title=NASA's Fermi Probes "Dragons" of the Gamma-ray Sky |series=Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope |publisher=NASA |first=Francis |last=Reddy |date=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though active galactic nuclei do produce some of the gamma-ray radiation detected here on Earth, less than 30% originates from these sources. The search now is to locate the sources for the remaining 70% or so of all gamma-rays detected. Possibilities include [[Star formation|star forming galaxies]], [[Galaxy formation and evolution#Galaxy mergers and the formation of elliptical galaxies|galactic mergers]], and yet-to-be explained dark matter [[Self-interacting dark matter|interactions]].

=== Milky Way Gamma/X-ray bubbles ===
In November 2010, it was announced two gamma-ray and X-ray bubbles were detected around Earth's galaxy, the Milky Way.&lt;ref name=bubbles&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2010-22 |title=Astronomers Find Giant, Previously Unseen Structure in our Galaxy |publisher=Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics |first1=David A. |last1=Aguilar |first2=Christine |last2=Pulliam |date=9 November 2010 |id=Release No. 2010-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bubbles, named Fermi Bubbles, extend about 25 thousand [[light years]] distant above and below the center of the galaxy.&lt;ref name=bubbles/&gt; The galaxy's diffuse gamma-ray fog hampered prior observations, but the discovery team led by D. Finkbeiner, building on research by G. Dobler, worked around this problem.&lt;ref name=bubbles/&gt;

=== GRB coincident with gravitational wave event GW150914 ===
Fermi reported that its GBM instrument detected a weak gamma-ray burst above 50 keV, starting 0.4 seconds after the LIGO event and with a positional uncertainty region overlapping that of the LIGO observation. The Fermi team calculated the odds of such an event being the result of a coincidence or noise at 0.22%.&lt;ref name="Connaughton2016"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fermi GBM Observations of LIGO Gravitational-wave Event GW150914 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |first1=V. |last1=Connaughton |first2=E. |last2=Burns |first3=A. |last3=Goldstein |first4=M.

Black hole mergers of the type thought to have produced the gravitational wave event are not expected to produce gamma-ray bursts, as stellar-mass black hole binaries are not expected to have large amounts of orbiting matter. [[Avi Loeb]] has theorised that if a massive star is rapidly rotating, the centrifugal force produced during its collapse will lead to the formation of a rotating bar that breaks into two dense clumps of matter with a dumbbell configuration that becomes a black hole binary, and at the end of the star's collapse it triggers a gamma-ray burst.&lt;ref name="fermi_woo"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2077783-ligos-black-holes-may-have-lived-and-died-inside-a-huge-star/ |title=LIGO's black holes may have lived and died inside a huge star |work=New Scientist |last=Woo |first=Marcus |date=16 February 2016 |accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Loeb"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Electromagnetic Counterparts to Black Hole Mergers Detected by LIGO |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |first=Abraham |last=Loeb |volume=819 |issue=2 |at=L21 |date=March 2016 |doi=10.3847/2041-8205/819/2/L21 |bibcode=2016ApJ...819L..21L |arxiv=1602.04735}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loeb suggests that the 0.4 second delay is the time it took the gamma-ray burst to cross the star, relative to the gravitational waves.&lt;ref name="Loeb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GRB on BBH"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.universetoday.com/127463/did-a-gamma-ray-burst-accompany-ligos-gravitational-wave-detection/ |title=Did a Gamma Ray Burst Accompany LIGO’s Gravity Wave Detection? |work=Universe Today |last=Gough |first=Evan |date=18 February 2016 |accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GRB 170817A signals a multi-messenger transient ===
On 17 August 2017, Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor software detected, classified, and localized a gamma-ray burst which was later designated as GRB 170817A. Six minutes later, a single detector at Hanford LIGO registered a gravitational-wave candidate which was consistent with a binary [[neutron star merger]], occurring 2 seconds before the GRB 170817A event. This observation was "the first joint detection of [[GW170817|gravitational]] and [[AT 2017gfo|electromagnetic radiation from a single source]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Multi-messenger Observations of a Binary Neutron Star Merger |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |first=B.

=== Gamma-ray Burst Monitor ===
The Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) (formerly GLAST Burst Monitor) detects sudden flares of [[gamma-ray]]s produced by [[gamma ray burst]]s and [[solar flare]]s. Its [[scintillator]]s are on the sides of the spacecraft to view all of the sky which is not blocked by the Earth. The design is optimized for good resolution in time and photon energy.

"Gamma-ray bursts are so bright we can see them from billions of light years away, which means they occurred billions of years ago, and we see them as they looked then," stated Charles Meegan of NASA's [[Marshall Space Flight Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/11jun_glast2.htm |title=NASA's Newest Space Telescope Blasts Off |publisher=NASA |first=Dauna |last=Coulter |date=11 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617210829/https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/11jun_glast2.htm |archivedate=17 June 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gamma-ray Burst Monitor has detected gamma rays from [[positron]]s generated in powerful thunderstorms.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"/&gt;

=== Large Area Telescope ===
The Large Area Telescope (LAT) detects individual [[gamma rays]] using technology similar to that used in terrestrial [[particle accelerator]]s. [[Photons]] hit thin metal sheets, converting to [[electron]]-[[positron]] pairs, via a process known as [[pair production]]. These charged particles pass through interleaved layers of silicon [[microstrip detector]]s, causing [[ionization]] which produce detectable tiny pulses of electric charge. Researchers can combine information from several layers of this tracker to determine the path of the particles. After passing through the tracker, the particles enter the [[calorimeter]], which consists of a stack of [[caesium iodide]] [[scintillator]] crystals to measure the total energy of the particles. The LAT's field of view is large, about 20% of the sky. The resolution of its images is modest by astronomical standards, a few [[arc minute]]s for the highest-energy photons and about 3 degrees at 100 [[MeV]]. The LAT is a bigger and better successor to the [[EGRET (telescope)|EGRET]] instrument on [[NASA]]'s [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] satellite in the 1990s. Several countries produced the components of the LAT, who then sent the components for assembly at [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]]. SLAC also hosts the LAT Instrument Science Operations Center, which supports the operation of the LAT during the Fermi mission for the LAT scientific collaboration and for NASA.

== Education and public outreach ==
Education and public outreach are important components of the Fermi project. The main Fermi education and public outreach website at http://glast.sonoma.edu offers gateways to resources for students, educators, scientists, and the public. NASA's [[NASA Education and Public Outreach Group|Education and Public Outreach]] (E/PO) group operates the Fermi education and outreach resources at [[Sonoma State University]].

== Rossi Prize ==
The 2011 [[Bruno Rossi Prize]] was awarded to Bill Atwood, Peter Michelson and the Fermi LAT team "for enabling, through the development of the Large Area Telescope, new insights into neutron stars, supernova remnants, cosmic rays, binary systems, active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts."&lt;ref name="Rossi2011"&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://aas.org/media/press-releases/astronomers-honored-excellence-research-education-writing-more |title=Astronomers Honored for Excellence in Research, Education, Writing &amp; More |publisher=American Astronomical Society |first=Rick |last=Fienberg |date=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the prize was awarded to Roger W. Romani of Leland Stanford Junior University and Alice Harding of Goddard Space Flight Center for their work in developing the theoretical framework underpinning the many exciting pulsar results from Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.&lt;ref name="Rossi2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/features/2013/harding-rossi-prize.html |title=NASA Goddard Astrophysicist Wins Prize for Pulsar Work |publisher=NASA |date=4 February 2013 |accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5249">In [[music]], '''flat''' or '''bemolle''' (Italian: "soft B") means "lower in [[pitch (music)|pitch]]". More specifically, in [[musical notation]], flat means "lower in [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] by one [[semitone]] (half step)". Flat is the opposite of [[Sharp (music)|sharp]], which is a raising of pitch.

In [[music notation]], the flat symbol, {{Music|b}}, derived from a stylised lowercase "''b''", lowers a [[Musical note|note]] by a [[semitone|half step]] (semitone).&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003). ''Music in Theory and Practice, Vol. 1'', p. 6. McGraw-Hill, Seventh edition. "''Flat'' ({{music|b}})—lowers the pitch a half step."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/NewDesign/fglossary.files/bglossary.files/Flat.htm Flat], [http://www.naxos.com/education/glossary.asp Glossary], [[Naxos Records]]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the music below has a key signature with three flats (indicating either [[E-flat major|E{{Music|b}} major]] or [[C minor]]) and the note, [[D♭ (musical note)|D{{Music|b}}]], has a flat [[Accidental (music)|accidental]].

: &lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
\relative c'' { 

  \clef treble \key es \major \time 4/4 des1
} }

&lt;/score&gt;
The [[Unicode]] character ♭ (U+266D) can be found in the [[Plane (Unicode)|block]] [[Miscellaneous Symbols]]; its [[HTML entity]] is &lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#9837;&lt;/tt&gt;.

Under [[twelve-tone equal temperament]], [[C-flat (musical note)|C{{music|b}}]] for instance is the same as (or [[enharmonically equivalent]] to) [[B (musical note)|B{{music|natural}}]], and [[G-flat (musical note)|G{{music|b}}]] is equivalent to [[F♯ (musical note)|F{{Music|#}}]]. In any other [[Musical tuning#Tuning systems|tuning system]], such enharmonic equivalences in general do not exist. To allow extended [[just intonation]], composer [[Ben Johnston (composer)|Ben Johnston]] uses a sharp as an accidental to indicate a note is raised 70.6 [[cent (music)|cents]] (ratio 25:24), and a flat to indicate a note is lowered 70.6 cents.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Fonville]]. "Ben Johnston's Extended Just Intonation- A Guide for Interpreters", p. 109, ''Perspectives of New Music'', Vol. 29, No. 2 (Summer, 1991), pp. 106–137. "...the [[Just chromatic semitone|25/24 ratio]] is the sharp ({{music|#}}) ratio...this raises a note approximately 70.6 cents."&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Intonation (music)|intonation]], flat can also mean "slightly lower in pitch" (by some unspecified amount). If two simultaneous notes are slightly out-of-tune, the lower-pitched one (assuming the higher one is properly pitched) is "flat" with respect to the other. Furthermore, the verb ''flatten'' means to lower the pitch of a note, typically by a [[Comma (music)|small musical interval]].

== Key signatures ==
Flats are used in the [[key signature]]s of
* [[F major]] / [[D minor]]
* [[B-flat major|B{{music|b}} major]] / [[G minor]]
* [[E-flat major|E{{music|b}} major]] / [[C minor]]
* [[A-flat major|A{{music|b}} major]] / [[F minor]]
* [[D-flat major|D{{music|b}} major]] / [[B-flat minor|B{{music|b}} minor]]
* [[G-flat major|G{{music|b}} major]] / [[E-flat minor|E{{music|b}} minor]]
* [[C-flat major|C{{music|b}} major]] / [[A-flat minor|A{{music|b}} minor]]
The order of flats in the key signatures of music notation, following the [[circle of fifths]], is B{{music|b}}, E{{music|b}}, A{{music|b}}, D{{music|b}}, G{{music|b}}, C{{music|b}} and F{{music|b}} ([[mnemonic|mnemonics]] for which include '''B'''attle '''E'''nds '''A'''nd '''D'''own '''G'''oes '''C'''harles' '''F'''ather ''and'' '''B'''efore '''E'''ating '''A''' '''D'''oughnut '''G'''et '''C'''offee '''F'''irst).

== Related symbols ==
'''Double flats''' also exist, which look like {{music|bb}} (similar to two flats, {{music|b}}{{music|b}}) and lower a note by two semitones, or a whole step. The Unicode character 𝄫 (U+1D12B) in the [[Musical Symbols (Unicode block)|Musical Symbols]] block represents the double-flat sign.

: &lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
\relative c'' { 

  \clef treble \key c \major \time 4/4 beses1
} }

&lt;/score&gt;
A '''quarter-tone flat''' or '''half flat''', indicating the use of [[quarter tone]]s, may be marked with various symbols including a flat with a slash ({{music|flatstroke}}) or a reversed flat sign ({{music|d}}). A '''three-quarter-tone flat''', '''flat and a half''' or '''sesquiflat''', is represented by a half flat and a regular flat ({{music|db}}).

: &lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
\relative c'' { 

  \clef treble \key c \major \time 4/4 ceh1 deseh
} }&lt;/score&gt;
Although very uncommon, a '''triple flat''' ({{music|bbb}}) can sometimes be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/donbyrd/CMNExtremes.htm|title=Extremes of Conventional Music Notation|last=Byrd|first=Donald|date=September 2016|publisher=[[Indiana University Bloomington]]|access-date=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lowers a note three [[semitone]]s.

}}[[Tornadoes]], [[cyclones]], and other storms with strong winds damage or destroy many buildings. However, with proper design and construction, the damage to buildings by these forces can be greatly reduced. A variety of methods can help a building survive strong winds and storm surge.

==Storm surge considerations==

Waves along coastal areas can destroy many buildings. Buildings should preferably be built on high ground in order to avoid waves. If waves can reach the building site, the building ought to be elevated on steel, concrete, or wooden pilings or anchored to solid rock.

==Wind loading considerations==

===The foundation===

[[File:Pensacola Beach, Florida after Hurricane Dennis in 2005.jpg|right|thumb|A [[monolithic dome]] in [[Pensacola Beach, Florida#Novelty houses|Pensacola Beach, Florida]], after [[Hurricane Dennis]] in 2005]]
Wind acting on the roof surfaces of a building can cause negative pressures that create a lifting force sufficient  to lift the roof off the building. Once this occurs, the building is weakened considerably and the rest of the building will likely fail as well. To minimize this vulnerability, the upper structure ought to be anchored through the walls to the foundation.

Several methods can be used to anchor the roof. Typically, roof trusses are "toenailed" into the top of the walls, which provide insufficient force to resist high winds. [[Hurricane tie]]s nail into the wall and wrap over the trusses provide higher force resistance.

====Mobile home tie down to the foundation====
Interlocking metal pan roof systems installed on mobile homes can fail under the pressure differential (lift) created by the high velocity winds passing over the surface plane of the roof. This is compounded by the wind entering the building allowing the building interior to pressurize lifting the underside of the roof panels, resulting in destruction of the building.  One example of pan roof systems can be found in this document from [http://www.structall.com/pdf/guides/RoofOverGuide.pdf Structall Building Systems].

To mitigate this pressure differential, pre-installed aluminum tabular channels can permanently be fastened perpendicularly across the top of the interlocking ribs of the metal roof system without disturbing the flow of rainwater at the eaves, mid-span, and ridge locations of the building.

===Earth-sheltering===
[[Earth sheltering|Earth-sheltered]] construction is generally more resistant to strong winds and tornadoes than standard construction. Cellars and other earth sheltered components of other buildings, can provide safe refuge during tornadoes.

===Dome homes===
{{Main|Geodesic dome|Monolithic dome}}
The physical geometry of a building affects its aerodynamic properties and how well it can withstand a storm. Geodesic dome roofs or buildings have low drag coefficients and can withstand higher wind forces than a square building of the same area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanford.edu/~scheulen/.../StructuralMechanicsFinalReport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ewb-uk.org/system/files/Marek+Kubik+report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Even stronger buildings result from [[monolithic dome]] construction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.monolithic.com/stories/building-survivability-the-strength-of-the-monolithic-dome&lt;/ref&gt;

===Log house===
{{Main|Log house}}
A CAT 5 hurricane-proof [[log house]] is resistant to the winds up to 245 mph. Wall logs in such construction have to be made of&lt;ref&gt;http://eccobauer.com/en/hurricane-proof-log-housef&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glued_laminated_timber&lt;/ref&gt; [[glued laminated timber]] and all other components of the house have to be hurricane-resistant.

==Building components==
Building openings such as garage doors and windows are often weak points susceptible to failure by wind pressure and blowing debris. Once failure occurs, wind pressure builds up inside the building resulting in the roof lifting off the building. [[Hurricane shutters]] can provide protection.

Doors can be blown into the house by wind, causing potential [[structural failure]] (see http://www.floridadisaster.org/hrg/content/openings/openings_index.asp#Hinged_Exterior_Doors).

Windows can be constructed with plastic panes, shatterproof glass, or glass with protective membranes. The panes are often more firmly attached than normal window panes, including using screws or bolts through the edges of larger panes. Tapcons are used to fasten windows with the concrete structure surrounding.

Wood has a relatively high degree of flexibility, which can be beneficial under certain building stresses.

[[Reinforced concrete]] is a strong, dense material that, if used in a building that is designed properly, can withstand the destructive power of very high winds, and high-speed debris.

==Regulation==
After [[Hurricane Andrew]] in 1992 caused $16 billion in insured damage, the state of [[Florida]] established new building standards and enforcement. The state increased performance criteria for wind-load provisions and adopted new wind provisions from the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]. One important addition included with the new code was the requirement of [[Toughened glass|missile-impact resisting glass]], which can withstand high velocity impact from wind-borne debris during a hurricane. Many houses built in South Florida since Hurricane Andrew are [[Concrete masonry unit|cinder block masonry]] construction reinforced with concrete pillars, [[Truss|hurricane-strapped roof trusses]], and codes requirements for [[adhesive]]s and types of roofing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2007/05/18/79827.htm|title=Fla.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4361">A '''hypervariable region''' ('''HVR''') is a location within [[nuclear DNA]] or the [[D-loop]] of [[mitochondrial DNA]] in which [[base pair]]s of [[nucleotide]]s repeat (in the case of nuclear DNA) or have substitutions (in the case of mitochondrial DNA).  Changes or repeats in the hypervariable region are highly [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]].

==Mitochondrial==
[[File:Map of the human mitochondrial genome.svg|thumb|300px|Human mitochondrial genome showing hypervariable regions I to III (green boxes) located in the control region (CR ; grey box).]]

There are two mitochondrial hypervariable regions used in human mitochondrial [[genealogical DNA test]]ing.  HVR1 is considered a "low resolution" region and HVR2 is considered a "high resolution" region. Getting HVR1 and HVR2 DNA tests can help determine one's [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup|haplogroup]]. In the revised [[Cambridge Reference Sequence]] of the human mitogenome, the most variable sites of HVR1 are numbered 16024-16383 (this subsequence is called HVR-I), and the most variable sites of HVR2 are numbered 57-372 (''i.e.,'' HVR-II) and 438-574 (''i.e.,'' HVR-III).&lt;ref name="vanOven2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Oven M, Kayser M |title=Updated comprehensive phylogenetic tree of global human mitochondrial DNA variation |journal=Human Mutation |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=E386–94 |date=February 2009 |pmid=18853457 |doi=10.1002/humu.20921}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phylotree"&gt;''PhyloTree mt''.

In some [[bony fish]]es, for example certain [[Protacanthopterygii]] and [[Gadidae]], the [[mtDNA control region|mitochondrial control region]] evolves remarkably slowly. Even functional mitochondrial [[gene]]s accumulate mutations faster and more freely. It is not known whether such hypovariable control regions are more widespread. In the [[Ayu]] (''Plecoglossus altivelis''), an [[East Asia]]n protacanthopterygian, control region [[mutation]] rate is not markedly lowered, but sequence differences between [[subspecies]] are far lower in the control region than elsewhere. This phenomenon completely defies explanation at present.&lt;ref&gt;Takeshima, Hirohiko; Iguchi, Kei-ichiro &amp; Nishida, Mutsumi (2005): Unexpected Ceiling of Genetic Differentiation in the Control Region of the Mitochondrial DNA between Different Subspecies of the Ayu ''Plecoglossus altivelis''.

==Antibodies==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8212">'''Idealization''' is the process by which [[Scientific modelling|scientific models]] assume facts about the phenomenon being modeled that are strictly false but make models easier to understand or solve. That is, it is determined whether the phenomenon approximates an "ideal case," then the model is applied to make a prediction based on that ideal case.

If an approximation is accurate, the model will have high predictive accuracy; for example, it is not usually necessary to account for [[air resistance]] when determining the acceleration of a falling bowling ball, and doing so would be more complicated. In this case, air resistance is idealized to be zero. Although this is not strictly true, it is a good approximation because its effect is negligible compared to that of gravity.

Idealizations may allow predictions to be made when none otherwise could be. For example, the approximation of air resistance as zero was the only option before the formulation of [[Stokes' law]] allowed the calculation of drag forces. Many debates surrounding the usefulness of a particular model are about the appropriateness of different idealizations.

==Early use==
[[Galileo]] utilized the concept of idealization in order to formulate the law of [[free fall]]. [[Galileo]], in his study of bodies in motion, set up experiments that assumed frictionless surfaces and spheres of perfect roundness. The crudity of ordinary objects has the potential to obscure their mathematical essence, and idealization is used to combat this tendency.

The most well-known example of idealization in Galileo's experiments is in his analysis of motion. [[Galileo]] predicted that if a perfectly round and smooth ball were rolled along a perfectly smooth horizontal plane, there would be nothing to stop the ball (in fact, it would slide instead of roll, because rolling requires [[friction]]). This hypothesis is predicated on the assumption that there is no air resistance.

==Other examples==
===Mathematics===
[[Geometry]] involves the process of idealization because it studies ideal entities, forms and figures. Perfect [[circles]], [[spheres]], straight [[line (geometry)|lines]] and [[angle]]s are [[abstraction]]s that help us think about and investigate the world.

===Science===
An example of the use of idealization in [[physics]] is in [[Boyle's law|Boyle’s Gas Law]]:
''Given any x and any y, if all the molecules in y are perfectly elastic and spherical, possess equal masses and volumes, have negligible size, and exert no forces on one another except during collisions, then if x is a gas and y is a given mass of x which is trapped in a vessel of variable size and the temperature of y is kept constant, then any decrease of the volume of y increases the pressure of y proportionally, and vice versa.''

In [[physics]], people will often solve for [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian]] systems without [[friction]]. While we know that friction is present in actual systems, solving the model without friction can provide insights to the behavior of actual systems where the [[force (physics)|force]] of friction is negligible.

===Social science===
It has been argued by the "Poznań School" (in Poland) that [[Karl Marx]] utilized idealization in the [[social sciences]] (see the works written by [[Leszek Nowak]]).&lt;ref&gt;About the Poznań School, see F. Coniglione, ''Realtà ed astrazione. Scuola polacca ed epistemologia post-positivista'', Catania:CUECM 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in [[Model (economics)|economic models]] individuals are assumed to make maximally rational choices.&lt;ref&gt;B. Hamminga, N.B. De Marchi (Eds.), ''Idealization VI: Idealization in Economics'', Poznań Studies in the Philosophy of the Sciences and the Humanities, Vol. 38, Rodopi:Atlanta-Amsterdam 1994&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption, although known to be violated by actual humans, can often lead to insights about the behavior of human populations.

In [[psychology]], [[idealization]] refers to a [[defence mechanism]] in which a person perceives another to be better (or have more desirable attributes) than would actually be supported by the evidence. This sometimes occurs in [[child custody]] conflicts. The child of a single parent frequently may imagine ("idealize") the (ideal) absent parent to have those characteristics of a perfect parent. However, the child may find imagination is favorable to reality. Upon meeting that parent, the child may be happy for a while, but disappointed later when learning that the parent does not actually nurture, support and protect as the former caretaker parent had.

==Limits on use==
While idealization is used extensively by certain scientific disciplines, it has been rejected by others.&lt;ref name=LIU2004&gt;{{Citation |title=Laws and Models in a Theory of Idealization | author=Chuang Liu | journal=Synthese | year=2004 | volume=138 | issue=3 | pages=363–385 | doi= 10.1023/b:synt.0000016425.36070.37}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Edmund Husserl]] recognized the importance of idealization but opposed its application to the study of the mind, holding that mental phenomena do not lend themselves to idealization.&lt;ref&gt;Klawiter A (2004). [http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~klawiter/Husserl&amp;Idealization-PS-82.pdf ''Why did Husserl not become the Galileo of the Science of Consciousness?''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although idealization is considered one of the essential elements of modern [[science]], it is nonetheless the source of continued controversy in the literature of the [[philosophy of science]].&lt;ref name=LIU2004/&gt; For example, [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]] suggested that Galilean idealization presupposes tendencies or capacities in nature and that this allows for extrapolation beyond what is the ideal case.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright N (1994) [http://141.105.33.55/~lomov/library/bigdvd/dvd54/Cartwright%20N.%20-%20Nature's%20Capacities%20and%20Their%20Measurement(194).pdf ''Nature's capacities and their measurement.''] pp. 186–191.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is continued philosophical concern over how Galileo’s idealization method assists in the description of the behavior of individuals or objects in the real world. Since the laws created through idealization (such as the [[ideal gas law]]) describe only the behavior of ideal bodies, these laws can only be used to predict the behavior of real bodies when a considerable number of factors have been physically eliminated (e.g. through shielding conditions) or ignored. Laws that account for these factors are usually more complicated and in some cases have not yet been developed.

The '''Institute for the Study of Violent Groups''' ('''ISVG''') is a [[research institute]] focused on [[insurgency]], [[terrorism]], and [[transnational organized crime]] located at the [[University of New Haven]] in [[West Haven, Connecticut]].

The organization's main mission is to aggregate, code, and [[Data analysis|analyze data]].&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved from http://www.isvg.org/about/data/ on August 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization claims to have built the largest and most comprehensive [[Open source intelligence|open-source]] database on [[violent extremism]] and transnational threats, which can be accessed via the DAVE Data Access and Visualization Environment (D.A.V.E.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved from http://vkb.isvg.org/dave on August 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ISVG provides this open-source data and analysis to federal, state, and local [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] in support of [[counter-terrorism]].

==History==
ISVG was established in 2002 at [[Sam Houston State University]] in [[Texas]] by Dr. Richard Ward, then [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the College of Criminal Justice, through a grant from the [[Bureau of Justice Assistance]] at the [[United States Department of Justice]]. ISVG was originally created to test the feasibility of using a relational database to identify trends, relationships, and tactics of terrorist groups using only [[open source]] information.  

In 2008, Dr. Ward moved ISVG to the University of New Haven and began distributing its data collection efforts. In 2011, the ISVG launched its Violent Extremism Knowledge Base (VKB). The same year, it announced the Homeland Security Open Source Solution (HSOSS) with i2 Group, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved from http://www.i2group.com/us/solutions/open-source/homeland-security-os on August 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The original staff consisted of seven data collectors. Currently, ISVG has more than 90 personnel involved in collecting and analyzing open source information.

==Texts==

===Quran===
{{main article|Lot in Islam}}
The basic text of Islam is the [[Quran]], believed by [[Muslim]]s to represent the direct revelation of God to the prophet [[Muhammad]]. In terms of direct references in several places in the Qur'an, anal intercourse is identified with ''liwat'', the "sin of Lot's people".&lt;ref&gt;A Concise Encyclopedia of Islam - Page 132, Gordon Newby - 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lot in Islam|Lot]] was commissioned as a prophet to the cities of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Hasan, Masudul. ''History of Islam''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=July 2016}} His story is used to demonstrate Islam's disapproval of [[rape]] and homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Islam and Homosexuality - Page 206, Samar Habib - 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was commanded by God to preach to his people on [[Tawhid|monotheism]] and to stop them from their lustful and violent acts.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{verify source|date=July 2016}}

{{Quote|And [mention] Lot, when he said to his people, "Indeed, you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds.&lt;br&gt;Indeed, you approach men and obstruct the road and commit in your meetings [every] evil." And the answer of his people was not but they said, "Bring us the punishment of Allah, if you should be of the truthful."&lt;br&gt;He said, "My Lord, support me against the corrupting people."&lt;br&gt;And when Our messengers came to Abraham with the good tidings, they said, "Indeed, we will destroy the people of that Lot's city. Indeed, its people have been wrongdoers." |Quran|Sura 29 ([[Al-Ankabut]]), 28-31}}

The [[Quran]] expresses clear disapproval of ''lutis'' (described as male [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] rather than as sodomites). In the Qur'an, Lot is quoted as saying to his people:
{{Quote|"Do you approach males among the worlds. And leave what your Lord has created for you as mates? But you are a people transgressing." They said, "If you do not desist, O Lot, you will surely be of those evicted." He said, "Indeed, I am, toward your deed, of those who detest [it]." |Quran|Sura 26 ([[Ash-Shu'ara]]), 165-168}}

{{Quote|And [mention] Lot, when he said to his people, "Do you commit immorality while you are seeing? Do you indeed approach men with desire instead of women? Rather, you are a people behaving ignorantly."|Quran|Sura 27 ([[An-Naml]]), 54-55}}


The Qur'an directly comments on the people of Lot and on the nature of their sins:
{{Quote|By your life, [O Muhammad], indeed they [people of Lot] were, in their intoxication, wandering blindly. So the shriek seized them at sunrise. And We made the highest part [of the city] its lowest and rained upon them stones of hard clay. Indeed in that are signs for those who discern.|Quran|Sura 15 ([[Al-Hijr]]), 72-75}}

Although the Qur'an does not contain a specific punishment or guidance for a ''luti'', the context clearly indicates homosexuality as a moral corruption and describes the punishment for such action for the people of Lot when it grew widespread and accepted in their society.
{{Quote|And [We had sent] Lot when he said to his people, "Do you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds? Indeed, you approach men with desire, instead of women. Rather, you are a transgressing people." But the answer of his people was only that they said, "Evict them from your city! Indeed, they are men who keep themselves pure." So We saved him and his family, except for his wife; she was of those who remained [with the evildoers]. And We rained upon them a rain [of stones]. Then see how was the end of the criminals.|Quran|Sura 7 ([[Al-A'raf]]), 80-84}}

===Hadiths===
The [[hadith]] are reports of Muhammad's sayings and deeds from those close to him in his lifetime. Sunni Hadiths on the subject of anal intercourse between individuals clearly state that it is strictly forbidden. The four [[Madh'hab|Sunni schools]] unanimously disapprove anal intercourse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamawareness.net/Sex/fatwa_sex_008.html |title=Does anal intercourse cancel the marriage contract? |publisher=Islamawareness.net |date=2004-01-24 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/ref/6792 |title=Islam Question and Answer - Does anal intercourse cancel the marriage contract? |publisher=[[Islamqa]].info |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; as several hadith state:
* "If anyone [resorts to a diviner and believes in what he says (according) to the version of Musa) or] has intercourse with his wife (according to the agreed version) when she is menstruating, or has intercourse with his wife through her anus, he has nothing to do with what has been sent down to Muhammad." — Narrated by [[Sunni view of Abu Huraira|Abu Hurairah]], Book of Divination and Omens, [[Sunan Abu Dawood]], 3895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=29&amp;translator=3&amp;start=0&amp;number=3895#3895 |title=Hadith (Hadis) Books (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Sunan Abu-Dawud, and Malik's Muwatta) |publisher=Searchtruth.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "He who has intercourse with his wife through her anus is accursed"—Narrated by [[Sunni view of Abu Huraira|Abu Hurairah]], Book of Marriage, [[Sunan Abu Dawood]] 2157&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=11&amp;translator=3&amp;start=0&amp;number=2155 |title=Hadith (Hadis) Books (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Sunan Abu-Dawud, and Malik's Muwatta) |publisher=Searchtruth.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "If you find someone doing the deed of the people of Lot, then execute the doer and the one to whom it was done." reported by [[Abd-Allah ibn Abbas|Ibn Abbas]], Book of Legal Punishments, [[Sunan al-Tirmidhi]], Book 17, Hadith 40 [Number 1456], classed as [[Hadith terminology|''hasan  according to Darussalam'']].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/tirmidhi/17 |title=Chapter: What Has Been Related About The Punishment Of The Sodomite |date= |accessdate=2013-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In marriage==
&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/91968|title=There is nothing in Islam to say that anal intercourse is permissible|last=|first=|date=2006-12-08|website=IslamQA|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same ruling applies for heterosexual relationship (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;married couple) when performed as "an alternative" while the wife is menstruating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/36722|title=Intimacy with one’s wife when she is menstruating or in nifaas|last=|first=|date=2009-02-24|website=IslamQA|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When married, it is rightful and obligatory for the husband and the wife to mutually fulfill their needs but only by upholding the guidance of Hadith and the Qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020308001613/http://www.wefound.org/texts/Ideal_Muslims_files/herhusband.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And they ask thee concerning menstruation. Say, "It is a harmful thing, so keep away from women during menstruation, and go not in unto them until they are clean. But when they have cleansed themselves, go in unto them as Allah has commanded you. Allah loves those who keep themselves clean." (2:222)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Sunni Islam, anal intercourse is forbidden even if husband and wife mutually agree on it because mutual agreement does not allow something that has been made forbidden in Sunni hadith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fareena Alam |url=http://www.themodernreligion.com/misc/sex/sex_queries.htm |title=Matters pertaining to Sex |publisher=Themodernreligion.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamworld.net/docs/marriage.html |title=The Etiquettes Of Marriage And Wedding |publisher=Islam World |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31 |first=Muhammad Naasirudden |last=al-Albaani |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825080106/http://www.islamworld.net/docs/marriage.html |archivedate=2012-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fareena |url=http://www.themodernreligion.com/misc/sex/sex-shariah.html |title=Human Sexuality and the Shariat |publisher=Themodernreligion.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/1103|title=Ruling on Intercourse with a Woman in her rectum|last=Al-Munajjid|first=Sheikh Muhammed Salih|date=1998-03-04|website=IslamQA|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], a contemporary [[Sunni]] [[List of modern-day Muslim scholars|Muslim scholar]], states that anal intercourse is [[Haraam|prohibited]] and a wife must abstain from it should her husband demand it, and may seek divorce over it if her husband persists or tries to force her,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/ref/6792 |title=Does anal intercourse cancel the marriage contract? |publisher=Islamqa.info |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503543866 When Husband Insists on Anal Sex with His Wife - IslamonLine.net - Ask The Scholar]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215054059/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503543866 |date=February 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the act is forbidden. Scholars like Qaradawi and [[Muhammad Al-Munajjid|Salih Al Munajjid]] have clarified that it doesn't nullify the marriage, and the wife must seek divorce in order to separate from the husband.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503547172 Anal Sex with the Wife: Does It Nullify Marriage? - IslamonLine.net - Ask The Scholar]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215054251/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503547172 |date=February 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/6792|title=Does anal intercourse cancel the marriage contract?|last=Al-Munajjid|first=Sheikh Muhammed Salih|date=2000-01-06|website=IslamQA|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Couples who have done it should repent and stop repeating such major sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/52803|title=Is there any expiation for having intercourse with a woman in her back passage|last=|first=|date=2004-12-01|website=IslamQA|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this regard, a commonly misinterpreted&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and decontextualized verse from the Qur'an is most often cited as a ground to validate anal intercourse between husband and wife:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zawaj.com/tag/anal-sex-in-islam/ |title=Anal Sex In Islam |publisher=Zawaj.com |accessdate=2012-07-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309174333/http://www.zawaj.com/tag/anal-sex-in-islam/|archive-date=2012-03-09|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Your women are a tilth for you (to cultivate) so go to your tilth as ye will''', and send (good deeds) before you for your souls, and fear Allah, and know that ye will (one day) meet Him. Give glad tidings to believers, (O Muhammad)
:—Qur'an 2:223&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Muhammad Al-Munajjid|Al Munajjid]] clarifies that this verse is indicative of the different positions a married couple may copulate in, or adopt, in sexual intercourse, and is fully permissible as long as intercourse takes place in the vagina and not anus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Involving the anus in lovemaking or foreplay is also forbidden&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/40520|title=Inserting fingers into the back passage|last=|first=|date=2003-09-20|website=IslamQA|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/71345|title=Intercourse in the back passage|last=|first=|date=2005-12-05|website=IslamQA|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inserting fingers or objects into the back passage is considered a perversion and is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/44971|title=Repulsive forms of pleasure|last=|first=|date=2003-09-25|website=IslamQA|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/60200|title=Ruling on one who puts something in his back passage, and how can he be treated?|last=|first=|date=2005-11-19|website=IslamQA|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the very word "cultivate" has been interpreted unanimously&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; by all Sunni Islamic jurists as impregnating the wife or nurturing wife as though a farmer cultivates a piece of land, but not as a means of performing forbidden practices.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

==Law (Shariah)==

===Sunni opinion ===
Islamic law, or ''[[Sharia|shariah]]'', developed during the 8th and 9th centuries in several different "schools" based on varying interpretations of the Quran and the hadith.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Jivraj&amp;de Jong, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[hadith]]s, the reported sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, prescribe harsh punishments for homosexuality, and this is reflected in the majority of shariah, the Islamic legal codes. Since sexual relations under shariah are only permissible within heterosexual marriage, it follows that sex outside such marriage is adultery and/or fornication, both of which attract punishments.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Homosexual sodomy, defined as adultery or fornication or both, thus attracts the same penalties as those crimes (flogging or death), although the exact punishment varies with schools and scholars.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;  [[Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi|Abu Eisa At-Tirmidhi]] said, “The people of knowledge disagreed over the legal punishment for the sodomite. The view of some of them is that he should be condemned to death, whether he is married or unmarried, and this is the saying of [[Malik ibn Anas|Malik]], [[Al-Shafi‘i|Ash-Shafi’ee]], [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ahmad]], and [[Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh|Ishaq]]. Scholars among the jurists of the companion’s students such as [[Hasan of Basra|Hasan Al-Basri]], [[Alqama ibn Qays|Ibrahim An-Nakh’ai]], [[Ata ibn Abi Rabah|Ata’ ibn Abu Rabah]] and others said that the legal punishment for sodomy is equivalent to the punishment for adultery, and this is the saying of [[Sufyan al-Thawri|Sufyan Ath-Thawri]] and the people of Kufa.”



One passage in the Qur'an takes a particular legal position towards proven adultery, as well as homosexuality in conjunction with the punishments mentioned in hadith as the punishment is prescribed for 'unlawful sexuality':&lt;ref&gt;Sura 4:16, quoted in Wafer, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Those who commit unlawful sexual intercourse of your women - bring against them four [witnesses] from among you. And if they testify, confine the guilty women to houses until death takes them or Allah ordains for them [another] way. And the two who commit it among you, dishonor them both. But if they repent and correct themselves, leave them alone. Indeed, Allah is ever Accepting of repentance and Merciful.|Quran|Sura 4 ([[An-Nisa]]), 15-16}}

Despite unanimous disapproval of Homosexuality in Islam, in practice, cultural norms in different Muslim countries vary from punishment to condemnation, and only a few Muslim countries actually carry out such punishments.

===Shi'ite opinion ===
Most Shia scholars do not permit anal intercourse, those who do say it is extremely [[Makruh|makrooh]].&lt;ref&gt;Therefore the majority of the Shi'ah mujtahids have derived two conclusions: (l) that anal intercourse is not haram but strongly disliked (karahatan shadidah) provided the wife agrees to it. (2) and if she does not agree to it, then all mujtahids say that it is precautionarily wajib to refrain from it. (See the fatawa of all contemporary mujtahids in their annotations to al-'Urwatu'l-Wuthqa, p. 628)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are strong indications that Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], looked unfavorably upon anal penetration as codified in his two volume work, [[Tahrir al-Wasilah]].

According to Grand Ayatollah [[Ali al-Sistani|Sistani]], anal intercourse between married couple is permissible under condition that "permission is bound to wife’s agreement", however the act itself "is strongly undesirable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alulbayt.com/rulings/11.htm|title=Fatwas of Sayyid Sistani|work=alulbayt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Grand Ayatollah [[Sadiq Hussaini Shirazi]], "anal sex is allowed with her (wife's) permission. Although very hated and discouraged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.shirazi.ir/topics/sex |title=Question: Is anal sex allowed in Islam? |publisher=shirazi.ir |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027074905/http://www.english.shirazi.ir/topics/sex|archive-date=2017-10-27|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Learning about Forests''' (LEAF) is one of the five programs run by the [[Foundation for Environmental Education]] (FEE), a [[non-governmental organization]] located in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. LEAF aims to encourage school classes and teachers to use [[forests]] for educational activities. The ''vision'' is to see an increased level of awareness and knowledge the key role the forest plays on our planet. The program's ''mission'' is to spread [[environmental education]] concerning forests and all their values among school children all around the world.

==Member organizations==
In August 2013, LEAF was composed of twenty-one organizations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LEAF Member Organi[z]ations|url=http://www.leaf-international.org/Side.cfm?ID_kanal=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Master of Engineering degree''' (abbreviated '''MEng''', '''M.E.''' or '''M.Eng.''') can be either an [[Academic degree|academic]] or [[Professional degree|professional]] [[master's degree]] in the field of [[engineering]].

==International variations==

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the Master of Engineering degree is a research degree requiring completion of a thesis. Like the [[Master of Philosophy]] (M.Phil.), it is considered a lesser degree than [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) and a higher degree than coursework master. It is not to be confused with Master of Engineering Science, Master of Engineering Studies or Master of Professional Engineering which are coursework master's degrees. Exceptions are Monash University which awards a Master of Engineering Science by either research or coursework, the University of Melbourne which offers a Master of Engineering by coursework,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.unimelb.edu.au/Postgrad/MEng/about/overview.html|title=404|author=|date=|website=www.eng.unimelb.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the University of Tasmania which offer a Master of Engineering Science by research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.utas.edu.au/static/documents/1096_Engineering.pdf University of Tasmania Engineering Course Guide] Accessed 16 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Melbourne accepted the first intake of Master of Engineering students in February 2010. The coursework Master of Engineering is offered in 11 specialisations and accepts graduates with three-year degrees in Science and Maths.

The entry requirement is completion of a [[bachelor's degree]] at or above the second class honours level. Some universities do not offer direct enrolment into [[Doctor of Philosophy degree]] and students must first enrol in a lesser research degree before "upgrading".

===Brazil===
In Brazil, the rough equivalent of a Master of Engineering degree is a professional master's degree of typically two years' length that involves mostly coursework and a thesis or research paper in applied engineering. Entrance to a Master of Engineering degree is a 5-year bachelor engineering degree.
Another variant (academic master) is equivalent to a Master of Science, such degree is tied to extensive research and is valid for a Ph.D. entry.
Both can be stricto sensu classified and it depends of the course provider institution..

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], the Master of Engineering degree is a [[professional degree]] of typically two years length that involves coursework and a thesis or research paper of significant depth. Some Canadian universities offer a Master of Engineering or either a [[Master of Science]] or [[Master of Applied Science]] in engineering or both. Master of Engineering degrees usually require more coursework and examination and less research, whereas Master of Applied Science degrees require less coursework and more research. However, this is not absolute since some universities only offer a Master of Engineering and some only offer a Master of Science or Master of Applied Science. Some universities differentiate only by the requirement to be resident and therefore assist in teaching/tutoring for a Master of Science Degree.

===Colombia===
In [[Colombia]], the Master of Engineering, which takes a minimum of two years, is a postgraduate program that follows the undergraduate of five years. Depending upon the emphasis is called Ms.Eng. with emphasis in Energy, Chemistry, Environment and so on. At the end, it is required to make a publication of the developed work in a recognized journal of scientific spreading as a requirement for the degree.

===Croatia===
Introduced with the [[Bologna process]], the Croatian Master of Engineering is typically a two-year program and a direct continuation of a three-year Bachelor course. The degree is abbreviated mag. ing. and followed by the field of study (for example: ''mag. ing. računarstva'' – Master of Computer Engineering)

===Finland===
There are two distinct degrees in [[Finland]], a taught university degree (''[[diplomi-insinööri]]'') and a polytechnic master's degree's (''[[Insinööri (amk)#The insinööri (ylempi amk) or insinööri (yamk) degree|insinööri (ylempi AMK)]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2005/20050423 Finnish legislation 423/2005 on degrees at Universities of Applied Sciences] Accessed: 21 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[diplomi-insinööri|former]] is translated as "Master of Science in Technology", the term "Master of Engineering" is predominantly used by [[Universities of Applied Sciences]], which offer master's degree programmes to holders of polytechnic bachelor's degrees (''[[insinööri (amk)]]''). As European [[Bologna process]] directs, in order to get a M.Eng. degree, B.Sc. engineers have to additionally study full-time one or two years and finalize a Master's thesis. Most of the M.Eng. degree programs are taught in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], but some Swedish and English language programs also exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metropolia.fi/en/studies/masters_degrees/ Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, Master's degrees] Accessed: 21 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In [[France]], two diploma exist for 5 years of study in the field of engineering: the Master's diploma in engineering (''diplôme de master en sciences de l'ingénieur'') which is usually delivered by Universities and the [[Engineer's degree]] ("[[diplôme d'ingénieur]]") which can only be delivered by some Engineering schools called [[grandes écoles]]—very selective schools that are generally smaller than universities—and provides "a level of education comparable to a master's degree in engineering in the United States" ([http://www.aacrao.org/resources/resources-detail-view/new-information-warrants-change-in-french-placement-recommendations|source AACRAO]).

The Engineer's degree usually prepare students for professional careers. Courses always include management, economy or more generally transverse courses. Training periods in industry or in laboratories are also required. The Master's diploma in engineering offers a more focused approach on a field of engineering. A Ph.D. program can be joined by acquiring a Master's diploma in engineering or an Engineer's degree.

===Germany===
In [[Germany]], the local engineer's degrees (Diplomingenieur (Dipl.-Ing.), a first degree after 5 years of study at a university and Dipl.-Ing. (FH), the engineering degree offered by Fachhochschulen after 4 years of study) were abolished in most universities in 2010 and were replaced by postgraduate master's degrees (M.Sc. and M.Eng.).

The first Master of Engineering courses were introduced in Germany in 2000 as result of the [[Bologna process]]. This type of master's degree is offered by German universities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zfuw.uni-kl.de/en/distance-learning-courses/science-engineering/software-engineering-for-embedded-systems/#zielsetzung|title=Software Engineering for Embedded Systems|website=www.zfuw.uni-kl.de|language=en|access-date=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Fachhochschulen]]'' (''[[Universities of Applied Sciences]]'') alike and is typically a two-year program with application-oriented coursework and an applied research thesis. The entry requirement is the successful completion of a [[bachelor's degree]] or an equivalent from before the Bologna process, with good marks. The nine leading German [[Technical University|Technical Universities]] (Group of [[TU9]]) prefer awarding the [[Master of Science]] degree for completing engineering studies in a master's program.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tu9.de/graduate/master.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===

In [[India]], Master of Engineering (ME) or Master of Technology (MTech) or Master of Science in Engineering (M.Sc.Eng.) degree is a [[postgraduate]] program in engineering field. This is generally a 2-year program (2 or more years in case of M.Sc.Eng. degree) after completing a 4-year [[undergraduate]] program in engineering resulting in the award of a [[Bachelor of Engineering]] or [[Bachelor of Technology]] degree.

Master of Science in Engineering (M.Sc.Eng.) degree in India is usually structured as an engineering research degree, lesser than [[Ph.D.]] and considered to be parallel to [[M.Phil.]] degree in humanities and science.

===Italy===
In Italy, the local engineer's degrees (Laurea in Ingegneria), a first degree after 5 years of study at a university were abolished in most universities in 2008.
The equivalent of a Master of Engineering degree is a professional master's degree (Laurea Magistrale) of two years length that involves mostly coursework and a thesis paper in applied engineering. Entry requirements to a Master of Engineering degree include a 3-year bachelor engineering degree (Laurea).

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], the Master of Engineering degree is generally a research based degree requiring completion of a thesis in key universities ([[University of Auckland]], [[University of Canterbury]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/future-students/qualifications-and-courses/masters-degrees/master-of-engineering/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineering.auckland.ac.nz/en/for/futurepostgraduates/fp-study-options/fp-admission-for-masters/master-of-engineering.html|title=Master of Engineering - The University of Auckland|author=|date=|website=www.engineering.auckland.ac.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the UK's [[Master of Philosophy]] (M.Phil.) in engineering or technology, it is considered a lesser degree than [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) and a higher degree than a coursework master. It is not to be confused with Master of Engineering Studies which is coursework master's degree.

In [[Auckland University of Technology]] (AUT), this degree can be achieved either by completing a thesis (research pathway) or a combination of coursework and research project (coursework pathway)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aut.ac.nz/study-at-aut/study-areas/engineering/postgraduate/master-of-engineering/&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Nepal===

In Nepal,  Master of Engineering or Master of Technology degree is a postgraduate program in engineering. This is generally a 2-year specialization program in a specific branch of engineering field. Students typically enter the ME/MTech program after completing a 4-year undergraduate program in engineering resulting in the award of a [[Bachelor of Engineering]] or [[Bachelor of Technology]] degree. [[Kathmandu University]], [[Tribhuwan University]], [[Pokhara University]] and [[Purvanchal University]] offer this degree.

===Japan===
In Japan, the {{Nihongo|master of engineering|工学修士|Kogaku Shushi}}, which takes a minimum of two years, is a [[postgraduate]] program that follows the undergraduate of four years. It is a research degree between the [[bachelor's degree]] and the [[doctor's degree]] and requires completion of a thesis.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, the master of engineering is a research-based [[postgraduate]] program that typically lasts 2 to 3 years including coursework and must be completed by a comprehensive thesis evaluated by an examination committee. It is generally awarded as a pre-doctoral qualification in the field of engineering. This is in contrast to the "master of science" programs in engineering which are coursework-based and do not require a research thesis.

===South Korea===
In South Korea, the master of engineering, which takes a minimum of two years, is a [[postgraduate]] program that follows the undergraduate of four years. It is commonly awarded for specializations in the field of engineering rather than the science. For example, the degree "master of science in computer science" differs from the degree "master of engineering in computer science" in that the latter one is mainly concentrated on the applicability of the design with strong relation with the hardware rather than the software. Generally, the master of engineering program includes both coursework and research.

===Poland===
'''Magister inżynier''' ('''mgr inż.''', literally: ''master engineer'') academic degree that can be obtained after 2 years post-graduate education (for students having already B.Eng.—''inż.'') or formerly (until full adaptation of [[Bologna process]] by university) through integrated 5 years B.Eng.–M.Eng. (or B.Sc.–M.Sc) programme, giving double degree ''mgr inż.''

===Slovakia===
[[Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies|FIIT]] [[Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava|STU]] Software engineering [[Engineering Council|IEE]] accreditation

[[:sk:Fakulta elektrotechniky a informatiky Slovenskej technickej univerzity|FEI]] [[Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava|STU]] engineering [[Engineering Council|IEE]] accreditation

===Spain===
Before the introduction of the [[Bologna Process]], there were two different Spanish Engineering degrees: "Ingeniería", which took 5 or in some cases 6 full-time yearly courses; and "Ingeniería Técnica", of a shorter duration: 3 years or in some cases 4 full-time yearly courses.

In the wake of the Bologna Process, the [[Higher education in Spain|Spanish Educational System]] implanted the "Máster Habilitante en Ingeniería" and the "Máster Universitario en Ingeniería" degrees (Postgraduate Studies), which use the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] system designed by the European Union. They are slightly shorter to the second half of the former Engineering ("Ingeniería") academic degree, whereas the Technical Engineering Degree is approximately similar to the [[Bachelor's Degree]] within the Bologna system.

Education in Engineering in Spain had traditionally not too many specialties (Naval, Aerospatial, Industrial, Civil, Telecommunications, Informatics, among others) as in the past specialization was not so necessary but after Bologna the Degrees and Masters branched out numerously, giving birth to hundreds of different combinations, opening the possibility to do a bachelor's degree in one university and specialty and then to take a Master´s degree on another specialty, perhaps at a different university, having usually passed an individual interview by the Dean and/or a "Propedeutics" exam or test of some sort, designed to guarantee a solid basis upon which to build further knowledge, that must take into consideration the relationship between the two branches of knowledge and among the subjects being taught at both degrees at the origin and the destination.

===Sweden===
The "Master of Engineering" title was introduced in some Swedish universities proceeding the Bologna process. The title "civilingenjör" (literally translated "Civilian engineer", the English term "Civil engineer" is not equivalent to "civilingenjör") is the equivalent of a M.Eng. as well as the "[[Master of Science in Engineering]]" title. A Master of Science in Engineering is awarded after a minimum of 5 years of studies. Before 2007-07-01, it was awarded after a minimum of 4½ year of studies. Students starting with their studies before 2007-07-01, but finishing them before 2015-06-30 and after 2007-07-01, may choose to obtain the title either after 4½ year or after 5 years.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]] the degree of Master of Engineering (MEng) is the highest award for undergraduate studies in engineering. It is the standard university-level qualification taken by people wishing to become [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|chartered engineers]] registered with the Engineering Council (EngC). The MEng degree represents the minimum educational standard required to become a chartered engineer, but there are other equally satisfactory ways to demonstrate this standard such as the completion of a BEng Honours and a subsequent postgraduate diploma, MA or MSc or by completion of the Engineering Council Postgraduate Diploma administered by [[City and Guilds]].  The UK MEng (undergraduate degree) is typically equivalent to the European [[Diplom|''Diplom Ingenieur'']] (Dipl.-Ing.) and [[:sv:Civilingenjör|''Civilingenjör'']] degrees.

EngC's minimum requirement for entry to a recognised MEng course is BBB at A-level, compared to CCC for a BEng Honours course. Universities are free to set higher entry requirements if they wish. Some universities, such as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and some courses at [[Imperial College London|Imperial]] only admit students to study for the MEng degree. (Their courses usually allow a student to leave with a bachelor's degree after three years, but these shortened degrees are not ECUK-recognised and therefore do not count towards the educational requirements for becoming a chartered engineer) Other universities, such as the [[University of Greenwich]], [[University of Surrey]], [[Coventry University]], [[Brunel University]] and [[Swansea University]], admit students to read for BEng Honours and MEng courses and allow students to change between the two during the early years of the course. The [[Open University]] offers the MEng degree as a postgraduate qualification but requires students to complete its course within four years of completing a BEng Honours degree.

In England, Northern Ireland and Wales the degree is a four-year course or a 'sandwich' five-year course (with one year spent working in industry). In Scotland, it is a five-year course. The Bachelor of Engineering degree (BEng) is usually a three-year course (four in Scotland) or can also include a year in industry. Many universities offer the BEng and may then allow a transfer onto the MEng The Graduateship in engineering, awarded by the [[City &amp; Guilds of London Institute]] (Institution Established in 1878 recognized by Royal Charter n.117 year 1900), is mapped to a British Bachelor of Engineering (Honours)—BEng (Honours)—degree. The Post Graduate Diploma is mapped to a British Master of Engineering (MEng) degree. The Membership in Engineering (MCGI)(NQF at Level 7) is a strategic Management/Chartered professional level and a Post Graduate Diploma, mapped to a British master's degree, awarded by the City &amp; Guilds of London Institute. This will be supported by a minimum of ten years of seasoned experience (peer reviewed) in areas as the Engineering + a British bachelor/graduateship (or by CEng).

Engineers who have been awarded a BEng(Ordinary) or BEng(Honours) and have appropriate training and experience in the work place are able to apply to become an [[Incorporated Engineer]] (IEng). If an engineer has studied beyond the BEng for an MSc or has an MEng, they may apply to become a [[Chartered Engineer]] (CEng), once they have completed the required amount of post graduate work-based competency training and experience. Competency and training requirements are met over a period of 4–8 years in practice for a total of 8–12 years education, training and professional responsibility. Formal structured post graduate training schemes such as the monitored professional development [[IMechE]] enable the Engineer in training to satisfy the requirements for Chartered Engineer faster.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engc.org.uk/documents/EC0006_UKSpecBrochure_MR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Chartered Engineer and Incorporated Engineer titles awarded by the Engineering Council UK, are very broadly equivalent to (but not the same as) North American Professional Engineer (PEng / PE) and Professional Technologist (PTech) designations, but with often a far greater geographical recognition.  However, P.Eng/PE serve a very different purpose than the CEng qualification.  PE/P.Eng are licenses to practice engineering in the public domain with legal liability at the state or provincial level.  Unlike C.Eng they are not qualifications or titles. Under government legislations they allow one to engage in professional practice in a defined geographic region.  For example, in Ontario the P.Eng license is issued within the Professional Engineers Act (established in 1922).  Despite the Washington accord PE/PEng does not equal C.Eng.  The ability of a C.Eng to practice engineering in the public domain in North America is determined on a case by case basis usually by state or province.  Agreements to recognize qualifications between EngC or Engineers Ireland and Engineers Canada or the USA ABET are not recognized by individual states or provinces.

====Structure====
MEng degrees usually follow the pattern familiar from [[bachelor's degrees]] with [[lecture]]s, [[laboratory]] work, [[coursework]] and [[exam]]s each year. There is usually a substantial project to be completed in the fourth year which may have a research element to it and a more teaching-based project to be completed in the third year. At the end of the third year, there is usually a threshold of academic performance in examinations to allow progression to the final year. At some universities, the structure of the final year is rather different from that of the first three, for example, at the [[University of York]], the final year for the Computer Systems and Software programme consists entirely of project work and intensive advanced seminar courses rather than traditional lectures and problem classes. Final results are, in most cases, awarded on the standard [[British undergraduate degree classification]] scale, although some universities award something structurally similar to 'Distinction', 'Merit', 'Pass' or 'Fail' as this is often the way that taught postgraduate master's degrees are classified.

====History====
At some universities in the UK in the early 1980s, the MEng was awarded as a taught postgraduate degree after 12 months of study. Its entry requirements would typically be like those for other taught postgraduate courses, including holding an undergraduate degree and its format would be similar to the modern MEng although, as with many postgraduate master's degrees, the project would extend over a longer period. MEng courses in their modern, undergraduate form were introduced in the mid-1980s in response to growing competition from technical-degree [[alumnus|graduates]] from continental [[Europe]], where undergraduate bachelor's degree courses are often longer than the usual three years in the UK. There was a feeling among recent graduates, the engineering institutions, employers and universities, that the longer and more in-depth study offered on the continent needed to be made available to UK students as well. Since to obtain a taught master's degree in the UK typically took an additional year beyond a bachelor's degree, it was decided that this extra year would be integrated into the undergraduate program and, instead of pursuing both a bachelor's and master's degree, students would proceed directly to a master's degree.

Since its introduction, the MEng has become the degree of choice for most undergraduate engineers, as was intended. The most common exception to this is international students who, because of the substantially higher fees they are charged, sometimes opt to take the tradition BEng/B.Sc. route where that is available{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}. Most of the [[Engineering society#United Kingdom|engineering institutions]] have now made an MEng the minimum academic standard necessary to become a [[Chartered Engineer]]. Students who graduated before the changes in the rules will still be allowed to use their bachelor's degree for this purpose and those who have earned a bachelor's degree since the changes can usually take some additional courses (known as 'further learning') over time to reach an equivalent standard to the MEng Some older universities such as [[Durham University|Durham]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/ecs/ecs_prospective_students/undergraduate/degrees/engineering/|title=Engineering and Computing Science - Durham University|author=|date=|website=www.dur.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2016}} allow students to obtain the BEng degree after the third year before continuing on to the fourth year.

====Other undergraduate masters====
The MEng is one of a number of integrated master's degrees introduced in the UK since the late 20th century, the other major degree introduced being MSci (Master in Science). Some universities, however, have chosen to award subject specific integrated master's degrees, in subjects such as [[Mathematics]] ([[MMath]]), [[Computer Science]] (MCompSci), [[Physics]] ([[MPhys]]), [[Chemistry]] ([[MChem]]) and [[Biology]] (MBiol).

===United States and Canada===
In the [[United States]] and Canada the Master of Engineering degree is generally a [[professional degree]] offered as a coursework-based alternative to the traditional research-based [[Master of Science]]. It is typically a two-year program, entered after the completion of a 4-year bachelor's degree and many universities allow students to choose between the Master of Engineering and the [[Master of Science]].
The Master of Engineering degree is offered at many leading universities in the United States and Canada on either a full-time and part-time (weekends or evenings) basis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gordon.tufts.edu/programs/m-s-in-engineering-management/academic-calendar/weekend|title=Flexible Schedule - Gordon Institute at Tufts University|author=|date=|website=tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered a [[terminal degree]] in the field of engineering.

Some M.Eng. degree programs require a scholarly project in addition to coursework. Some Master of Engineering programs require additional courses beyond those required for Master of Science students in order to better prepare students for professional careers. Some Master of Engineering programs highly encourage students to participate in collaborative consulting projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gordon.tufts.edu/programs/m-s-in-engineering-management/program-structure#tabs|title=MSEM Curriculum - Gordon Institute|author=|date=|website=tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; These courses may include topics such as business fundamentals, management and leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Master of Engineering, Duke University, http://meng.pratt.duke.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Merz (art style)''' is a [[synonym]] for the more common expression and term [[Dada]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Richard Huelsenbeck (Ed.): ''Dada Almanach''. New York, Something Else Press, 1966 (reprint of the 1920-edition).&lt;/ref&gt; and traces back to [[Kurt Schwitters]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ernst Nündel: ''Kurt Schwitters'' in Selbstzeugnissen und Bilddokumenten, Rowohlts Monograph 296, Reinbek bei Hamburg 1981. {{ISBN|3499502968}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The made-up word ''Merz'', however, traces back to Kurt Schwitters, who planned a Dada section in Hanover. But not being invited to the First International Dada Fair in Berlin in 1920, Schwitters was on the look-out for a ''totally unique hat fitting only a single head"— his own''.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Nündel: ''Kurt Schwitters'' in Selbstzeugnissen und Bilddokumenten, Rowohlts Monographien 296, Reinbek bei Hamburg 1981, p. 19 f. {{ISBN|3499502968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Original German quote translated by Arguseyed2200).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The very moment==
He found ''Merz'' by chance when creating a collage with the German word ''Kom'''merz''''' (commerce). The result: a nonsensical‚ dadaistic’ word. ''Merz'' became Schwitters 's very synonym for his own way of Dada.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Kurt Schwitters, 1887-1948: Urwerk'', Edited by Robert Galitz/Kurt Kreiler/Klaus Gabbert. Frankfurt am Main/Berlin 1986. {{ISBN|3-549-06667-8}}. New Edition: Zweitausendeins, Frankfurt am Main, 2007. {{ISBN|9783861506744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The very reception==
Kurt Schwitters, father of installation art and  a pioneer in fusing collage and abstraction—those two most transformative innovations of the 20th century art— influenced [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]],  the [[Fluxus]] movement and [[Joseph Beuys]], too.&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1722">'''Neo-Fauvism''' was a poetic style of painting from the mid-1920s proposed as a challenge to [[Surrealism]].&lt;ref name=grant&gt;Grant, Kim. ''Surrealism and the Visual Arts: Theory and Reception'', [http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521836555&amp;ss=exc Introduction]. Cambridge University Press 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-521-83655-5}}, {{ISBN|0-521-83655-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The magazine ''Cahiers d'Art'' was launched in 1926 and its writers mounted a challenge to the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] practice of [[Surrealist automatism|automatism]] by seeing it not in terms of [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] expression, but as another development of traditional artistry. They identified a group of artists as the exponents of this and termed them Neo-Fauves.&lt;ref name=grant/&gt;

Although these artists were later mostly forgotten, the movement had an effect of disillusioning the Surrealist group with the technique of graphic automatism as a revolutionary means of by-passing conventional aesthetics, ideology and commercialism.&lt;ref name=grant/&gt; 

Neo-Fauvism has been seen as the last trend within painting that could be marketed as a coherent style.&lt;ref name=GoetheInsitut&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/kue/bku/thm/ein/en178614.htm Goethe-Institut], retrieved 10 June 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822212258/http://www.goethe.de/kue/bku/thm/ein/en178614.htm |date=August 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to '''[[fiction]]''':

'''[[Fiction]]''' &amp;ndash; [[narrative]] which is made up by the author. [[literature|Literary work]], it also includes [[theatre|theatrical]], [[film|cinematic]], [[document]]al, and [[song|musical work]]. In contrast to this is [[non-fiction]], which deals exclusively in factual events (e.g.: [[Biography|biographies]], [[History|histories]]). '''Semi-fiction''' is fiction implementing a great deal of non-fiction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | ssrn = 981296 | title = The Role of Narrative Fiction and Semi-Fiction in Organizational Studies | first1 = G. | last1 = Whiteman | first2 = N. | last2 = Phillips | journal = ERIM Report Series Research in Management | date = 13 December 2006 | issn = 1566-5283 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. a fictional description based on a true story.

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What ''type'' of thing is fiction? ==
* Product of [[imagination]] &amp;ndash; Fiction forms pure imagination in the reader, partially because these novels are fabricated from [[creativity]] and is not pure truth; When the reader reads a passage from a novel he or she connects the words to images and visualizes the event or situation being read in their imagination, hence the word.
* Source of [[entertainment]] &amp;ndash; This type of entertainment is usually pursued to escape reality and imagine their own; which is suppressing [[Depression (mood)|depression]] with an [[emotional interest]].
* [[Genre]] &amp;ndash; any category of literature or other forms of art or culture, e.g. music, and in general, any type of discourse, whether written or spoken, audial or visual, based on some set of stylistic criteria.
* Opposite of [[non-fiction]] &amp;ndash; non-fiction is the form of any narrative, account, or other communicative work whose assertions and descriptions are understood to be fact.

== Elements of fiction ==

===Character===
* [[Fictional character]] &amp;ndash; person in a narrative work of arts (such as a novel, play, television series or film).
** [[Protagonist]] &amp;ndash; main character around whom the events of the narrative's plot revolve and with whom the audience is intended to share the most empathy.
** [[Antagonist]] &amp;ndash; character, group of characters, or an [[institution]], who oppose the main character.

===Plot===
* [[Plot (narrative)|Plot]] &amp;ndash; events that make up a story, particularly: as they relate to one another in a pattern or in a sequence; as they relate to each other through cause and effect; how the reader views the story; or simply by coincidence. 
** [[Subplot]] &amp;ndash; secondary strand of the plot that is a supporting side story for any story or the main plot. Subplots may connect to main plots, in either time and place or in thematic significance. Subplots often involve supporting characters, those besides the protagonist or antagonist.
** [[Story arc]] &amp;ndash; extended or continuing storyline in episodic storytelling media such as television, comic books, comic strips, boardgames, video games, and films with each episode following a narrative arc. On a television program, for example, the story would unfold over many episodes.
** [[Narrative structure]] &amp;ndash; structural framework that underlies the order and manner in which a narrative is presented to a reader, listener, or viewer. The narrative text structures are the plot and the setting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5053">'''Peter Kivy''' (October 22, 1934 – May 6, 2017&lt;ref&gt;[https://aesthetics-online.site-ym.com/news/344130/Peter-Kivy-1934-2017.htm Tribute] at the [[American Society for Aesthetics]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sinfoniavirtual.com/revista/032/joykivy.pdf James O. Young: In Memoriam Peter Kivy], bilingüal edition (English/Spanish, translation by Daniel Martín Sáez) at ''Sinfonía Virtual. Revista de Música Clásica'', nº 32 (2017), pp. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;) was professor emeritus of musicology and philosophy at [[Rutgers University]]. He studied particularly the [[philosophy of music]].

==Biography==
Kivy earned master's degrees in both philosophy ([[University of Michigan]], 1958) and musicology ([[Yale University]], 1960). He earned his PhD at [[Columbia University]] in 1966. He joined the faculty at Rutgers the following year, and became full professor in 1976. He taught there for his whole career except one year as a visiting professor at [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].

His early work was on the 18th-century British aesthetics, and was influenced by [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]]. From there he developed an interest in analytic aesthetics. From the late 1970s on, he had been interested mainly in music philosophy. His book ''The Corded Shell'' made him a central figure in music aesthetics.&lt;ref name=Cumming&gt;Cumming.&lt;/ref&gt;

One preoccupation of his had been the problem of what it means for instrumental music to "express" an emotion. His answer is that common emotions have physical behavioral expression in people that can be understood by appearance and imitated in music; thus, music cannot express more complex emotions that do not have an obvious behavioral expression. A similar position is followed by [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]].&lt;ref name=Cumming/&gt;

Some criticism of Kivy's ideas is available in ''Music, Philosophy, and Modernity'' (2007) by [[Andrew Bowie]] and ''Filosofía de la Música. Respuestas a Peter Kivy'' (2017, published in Spanish) by [[James O. Young]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8859">'''Popular music pedagogy''' — alternatively called popular music education, rock music pedagogy, or rock music education — is a development in [[music education]] consisting of the systematic teaching and learning of [[popular music]] both inside and outside formal classroom settings.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David G. "Originality and Institutionalization: Factors Engendering Resistance to Popular Music Pedagogy in the U.S.A.." Music Education Research International 5, pp.12-21 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Popular music pedagogy tends to emphasize group [[improvisation]]&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Lee and Campbell, Patricia Shehan, Free to be Musical: Group Improvisation in Music (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; and is more often associated with community music activities than fully institutionalized school music ensembles.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Lee, Community Music: In Theory and in Practice (Oxford University Press, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of popular music pedagogy may be traced to the gradual infusion of rock music into formal schooling since the 1960s (in the UK, the USA, and elsewhere), however it has expanded as a specialization to include the offering of degree programs — including [[graduate degree]]s — in institutions of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Lebler, Don "Popular Music Pedagogy: Peer Learning in Practice." ''Music Education Research'' 10 no. 2, pp.93-213 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Some notable community institutions, such as Cleveland's [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum]] and Seattle's [[Experience Music Project]] have also contributed to the development of popular music pedagogy through symposia and educational outreach programs.

The UK has pioneered the teaching of popular music, the first degree programme beginning as early as 1994 at Salford University. Postgraduate programmes were later introduced, for example at the Institute of Popular Music at the University of Liverpool. There are now more than 76 popular music studies degree programmes in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaspmjournal.net/index.php/IASPM_Journal/article/view/620&lt;/ref&gt; These programs expanded when the UK government made popular music a core part of schools' music provision through the Curriculum 2000 developments. The effect rippled into other countries as well. Popular music is commonly taught in German speaking countries &lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaspmjournal.net/index.php/IASPM_Journal/article/view/571&lt;/ref&gt; and in Ghana, for example.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaspmjournal.net/index.php/IASPM_Journal/article/view/563&lt;/ref&gt; It is also increasingly common in Australia. However, popular music courses tend to be based in newer institutions, rather than older more traditional ones, which often still focus principally on classical music.

== Degree programs==
Numerous institutions worldwide now offer [[popular music]] pedagogy as a component of their degree programs. The following is a partial list of institutions that offer advanced degree programs in popular music pedagogy and related fields:

===Australia===
*[[Griffith University]] (B. Popular Music)

===Denmark===
*[[Rhythmic Music Conservatory]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11213">'''Rational mysticism''', which encompasses both [[rationalism]] and [[mysticism]], is a term used by [[Academia|scholars]], [[Scientific method|researchers]], and other [[intellectual]]s, some of whom engage in studies of how [[Altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]] or [[Transcendence (philosophy)#Colloquial usage|transcendence]] such as [[trance]], [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]], and [[prayer]] occur. Lines of investigation include [[History|historical]] and [[Philosophy|philosophical]] [[inquiry]] as well as [[Models of scientific inquiry|scientific inquiry]] within such fields as [[neurophysiology]] and [[psychology]].

==Overview==
The term "rational mysticism" was in use at least as early as 1911 when it was the subject of an article by Henry W. Clark in the ''[[Harvard Theological Review]].''&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;  In a 1924 book, ''Rational Mysticism,''  [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] William Kingsland correlated rational mysticism with scientific [[idealism]].&lt;ref name="KingslandBook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KingslandTheosophy"/&gt;  South African philosopher [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J. N. Findlay]] frequently used the term, developing the theme in ''Ascent to the Absolute'' and other works in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="WilberBook"/&gt;

Columbia University [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[John Herman Randall, Jr.]] characterized both [[Plotinus]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]] as “rationalists with overtones of rational mysticism” in his 1970 book ''Hellenistic Ways of Deliverance and the Making of Christian Synthesis.''&lt;ref name="RandallPlotinos"/&gt;  
Rice University professor of [[religious studies]] [[Jeffrey J. Kripal]], in his 2001 book ''Roads of Excess, Palaces of Wisdom,'' defined rational mysticism as “not a contradiction in terms” but “a mysticism whose limits are set by reason.”&lt;ref name="KripalBook"/&gt;

In response to criticism of his book ''[[The End of Faith]]'', author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] used the term rational mysticism for the title of his rebuttal.&lt;ref name="HarrisEssay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NandaWheels"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HarrisNeuroNYPL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HarrisNeuroABC"/&gt;  University of Pennsylvania [[Neurotheology|neurotheologist]] [[Andrew B. Newberg|Andrew Newberg]] has been using [[nuclear medicine]] [[brain imaging]] in similar research since the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="NewbergCNN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NewbergForum"/&gt;

Executive editor of ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' magazine Corey S. Powell, in his 2002 book, ''God in the Equation,''   attributed the term to [[Albert Einstein]]: “In creating his radical cosmology, Einstein stitched together a rational mysticism, drawing on—but distinct from—the views that came before.”&lt;ref name="PowellBook"/&gt;

Science writer [[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]] interviewed and profiled [[James H. Austin|James Austin]], [[Terence McKenna]], [[Michael Persinger]], [[Christian Rätsch]], [[Huston Smith]], [[Ken Wilber]] and others for ''Rational Mysticism: Dispatches from the Border Between Science and Spirituality,''&lt;ref name="TeresiReview"/&gt;  his 2003 study of “the scientific quest to explain the transcendent.”&lt;ref name="McCauleyBook"/&gt;

'''Relationship education''' promotes practices and principles of premarital education, [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] resources, relationship restoration, relationship maintenance, and evidence-based marriage education.

==History==
The formal organization of relationship education in the [[United States]] began in the late 1970s by a diverse group of professionals concerned that the results of conventional methods and means of [[marriage therapy]] resulted in no appreciable reduction in the elevated rate of [[divorce]] and [[out-of-wedlock birth]]s. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The motivation for relationship education was found in numerous studied observations of the elevated rates of marital and family breakdown, school [[dropping out|drop-out]]s, [[incarceration]], [[drug addiction]], [[unemployment]], [[suicide]], [[homicide]], [[domestic abuse]] and other negative social factors when divorce and/or out-of-wedlock pregnancy were noted. In all of the negative categories noted above, statistical over-representation of adults whose childhood did not involve both of their parents was present.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Initial planning for the field of relationship education involved the participation of [[psychologists]], [[Mental Health Counselor|counselor]]s, [[family life educators]], [[social workers]], [[marriage and family therapists]], [[psychiatrists]], [[clergy]] from various faith traditions, policy makers, academicians in the fields of [[social science]], attorneys, judges, and lay persons.  The goal was to seek the broadest possible dispersal of research and marriage education skills courses which could improve interpersonal relationship functioning, especially with married and pre-marital couples.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Early contributors to the field of relationship education included David and Vera Mace, who founded The Association for Couples in Marriage Enrichment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2008.bettermarriages.org/Home/tabid/36/Default.aspx] Building Better Marriages: The Association for Couples in Marriage Enrichment&lt;/ref&gt; The Maces conducted their first couples retreat in 1962. Bernard and Louise Guerney launched the "Institute for the Development of Emotional and Life Skills," later known as "Relationship Enhancement," in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nire.org/] National Institute of Relationship Enhancement website.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Lori Heyman Gordon developed a semester-long, 120-hour relationship education course for American University graduate students, which she called "PAIRS," an acronym for the "Practical Application of Intimate Relationship Skills."&lt;ref&gt;DeMaria, Rita. ''Building Intimate Relationships'', "The Saga of PAIRS." Routledge, December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virginia Satir]], considered the "Mother of Family Therapy," began training therapists as relationship educators in 1984.&lt;ref name="satir" /&gt;

Two large scientific studies published in 2011 provided evidence that marriage and relationship education helps reduce divorce among military and distressed couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2011/07/13/marriage-education-and-relationship-skills-classes-gaining-traction-713] "Marriage Education and Relationship Skills Classes Gaining Traction," Fatherhood Channel, July 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Another showed evidence of significant gains for singles, couples and as a potential strategy to reduce rates of teen pregnancy.&lt;ref name="peluso"&gt;Peluso, Paul; Eisenberg Seth; Schindler, Rachel. "Marriage Education Impact Report," [[PAIRS Foundation]] for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, September 2011.[http://evaluation.pairs.com/reports/impact2011.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies, notably the [[Building Strong Families Program]], have shown that relationship education does not "improve relationship quality/satisfaction" for low-income, unwed couples, while another&lt;ref name="hawkins" /&gt; provided evidence of statistically significant benefits for low-income married couples.&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt;

==Rationale==

In 1984, [[Virginia Satir|Satir]] encouraged marriage and family therapists to shift their focus to relationship education:

{{Quotation|"We’re at a crossroads, an important crossroads of how we view people. That’s why it’s possible now for all the different kind of therapies to go into education, education for being more fully human, using what we know as a pathology is only something that tells us that something is wrong and then allows us to move towards how we can we use this to develop round people. I’m fortunate in being one of the people who pushed my way through to know that people are really round. That’s what it means to me to look at people as people who have potential that can be realized, as people who can have dreams and have their dreams work out. What people bring to me in the guise of problems are their ways of living that keep them hampered and pathologically oriented. What we’re doing now is seeing how education allows us to move toward more joy, more reality, more connectedness, more accomplishment and more opportunities for people to grow."&lt;ref name="satir"&gt;Eisenberg, Seth. "Revolutions of a Lifetime at Home and Abroad," Fatherhood Channel, February 21, 2011.[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2011/02/21/revolutions-of-a-lifetime-at-home-and-abroad-084/]&lt;/ref&gt;|Virginia Satir}}

===Impact of women's liberation===

Satir said the need for relationship education emerged from shifting gender roles as [[Feminist movement|women gained greater rights and freedoms]] during the 20th century:

{{Quotation|"As we moved into the 20th century, we arrived with a very clearly prescribed way that males and females in marriage were to behave with one another ... The pattern of the relationship between husband and wife was that of the dominant male and submissive female ... A new era has since dawned ... the climate of relationships had changed, and women were no longer willing to be submissive ... The end of the dominant/submissive model in relationships was in sight. However, there was very little that had developed to replace the old pattern; couples floundered ... Retrospectively, one could have expected that there would be a lot of chaos and a lot of fall-out. The change from the dominant/submissive model to one of equality is a monumental shift. We are learning how a relationship based on genuine feelings of equality can operate practically."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Satir | first = Virginia | author-link = Virginia Satir | contribution = Introduction to for our future, for our family | editor-last = PAIRS Foundation | editor-link = PAIRS Foundation | title = For our future, for our family: participant handbook | url = http://www.pairsusa.com/p-42-for-our-future-for-our-family-participant-handbook.aspx | location = Broward County, Florida | page = 6 | publisher = [[PAIRS Foundation]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305044746/http://www.pairsusa.com/p-42-for-our-future-for-our-family-participant-handbook.aspx | archivedate = 2016-03-05 | df =  }} (Participant handbook for PAIRS 30-hour curriculum for Supporting Healthy Marriages.)

In 2006, the U.S. [[Department of Health and Human Services]] began funding significant multi-year demonstration projects through the [[Administration for Children and Families]] to expand the availability of marriage education classes in more than 100 communities nationwide. This project, known as the "[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/healthymarriage/ Healthy Marriage Initiative]," was designed to improve the well-being of children by providing tools and education to strengthen marriages and families.

[[Jeffry H. Larson]] conducted several studies on marriage and relationship education, including a review of three widely used premarital inventories - Focus, Prepare, and Relate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-115465399.html] Larson, Jeffrey. "A review of three comprehensive premarital assessment questionnaires," Journal of Marital and Family Therapy, April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==

===Relationship education for premarital couples===

A multi-year federal study, known as the [[Building Strong Families Program]], and 2010 meta-analysis&lt;ref name="hawkins" /&gt; of 47 studies found that relationship education "does not improve relationship quality/satisfaction" for unmarried couples.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Previous studies have asserted that premarital education programs have a positive effect on program participants. Using meta-analytic methods of current best practices to look across the entire body of published and unpublished evaluation research on premarital education, we found a more complex pattern of results. We coded 47 studies and found that premarital education programs do not improve relationship quality/satisfaction when unpublished studies are included in the analysis, although studies that follow couples past the honeymoon stage to detect prevention effects are rare. In contrast, premarital education programs appear to be effective at improving couple communication, with studies that employed observational measures rather than self-report measures producing large effects. Still, given the mixed, modest results, there is ample room and a real need to improve the practice of premarital education."&lt;ref name="hawkins"&gt;Hawkins, Alan J.; Fawcett Elizabeth B.; Blanchard, Victoria L.; Carroll, Jason. "Do Premarital Education Programs Really Work? A Meta-analytic Study," Volume 59, Issue 3, pages 232–239, July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Building Strong Families Program====

Between 2002 and 2011, Mathematica Policy Research conducted the [[Building Strong Families Program]] study for the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Administration for Children and Families]], "to learn whether well-designed interventions can help couples fulfill their aspirations for a healthy relationship, marriage, and a strong family."&lt;ref name="opre"/&gt;

The study specifically evaluated the impact of relationship education classes delivered to more than 5,000 low-income, unwed couples at 12 locations in seven states. "The intervention featured up to 42 hours of multi-couple group sessions led by trained facilitators, focusing on skills that, according to earlier research, are associated with relationship and marital stability and satisfaction."&lt;ref name=opre&gt;[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/resource/the-building-strong-families-project-implementation-of-eight-programs-to] U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Mathematica reported findings from a 15-month follow-up of program and control group participants:

* BSF had no effect on whether couples were still together 15 months after they had applied for the program, when data from the eight BSF programs are combined. At this point, 76 percent of BSF couples were still romantically involved, compared with 77 percent of control group couples. Similarly, BSF and control group couples were equally likely to be married to each other at that time (17 and 18 percent respectively) and to be living together, whether married or unmarried (62 percent for both research groups)."&lt;ref name=impact&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/PDFs/Family_Support/BSF_impact_finalrpt.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720101532/http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/pdfs/family_support/BSF_impact_finalrpt.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-20 |df= }} Administration for Children and Families, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation, Wood, Robert G., et al., "The Building Strong Families Project," May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fifteen months after they applied for the program, BSF and control group couples reported being equally happy in their romantic relationships, with average ratings of 8.4 and 8.3 respectively on a 0-to-10 relationship happiness scale. Similarly, BSF and control group couples gave very similar ratings of supportiveness and affection in their relationships, with average support and affection scale values of 3.5 on a 1-to-4 scale for couples in both research groups. In addition, BSF had no overall effect on how faithful couples were to each other.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;
* When results are averaged across all eight programs, BSF did not improve couples’ ability to manage their conflict. Couples in both research groups reported similar levels of use of constructive conflict behaviors, such as keeping a sense of humor and listening to the other partner’s perspective during disagreements. Similarly, there was no difference between the research groups in the avoidance of destructive conflict behaviors, such as withdrawing when there is a disagreement or allowing small disagreements to escalate. In addition, when results are averaged across all programs, BSF had no effect on how likely couples were to experience [[intimate partner violence]].  Similarly, when results are averaged across all programs, BSF did not improve co-parenting or increase father involvement. BSF and control group couples reported that their co-parenting relationships were of equally high quality. In addition, at the 15-month follow-up, couples in both research groups were equally likely to report that fathers were living with their children, spending substantial time with them, and providing them with substantial financial support.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;
*The Baltimore BSF program [Loving Couples, Loving Children] had negative effects on couples’ relationships. BSF couples were less likely than control group couples to remain romantically involved, 59 percent versus 70 percent. Baltimore BSF couples reported being less supportive and affectionate toward each other than control group couples did. In addition, women in the Baltimore BSF program were more likely than women in the control group to report having been severely physically assaulted by a romantic partner in the past year, 15 percent compared with 9 percent. Baltimore BSF couples also rated the quality of their co-parenting relationship lower than control group couples did and reported that BSF fathers spent less time with their children and were less likely to provide them financial support than control group fathers were.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;

===Relationship education for married couples===

Several studies, notably the [[Supporting Healthy Marriage Project]] funded by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Administration for Children and Families]], a meta-analysis by Hawkins and Ooms&lt;ref name="works" /&gt; and a five-year impact report by Peluso, Eisenberg and Schindler&lt;ref name="peluso" /&gt; found that relationship education provided statistically significant benefits for married couples.&lt;ref name="impact" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The emerging evidence suggests that MRE [marriage and relationship education] programs can work for low-income populations as well as for those who are economically better off. The evidence from a new meta-analysis of 15 program evaluations (including three randomized control trials) shows that MRE programs can have positive, moderate size effects on low-income couples’ relationship outcomes, at least in the short run. However, the largest and most rigorous study of low-income, unmarried couples produced mixed results and shows there is still much to learn ... Across nearly all the studies reviewed for this Report, MRE improves communication—a core, essential relationship skill—as well as other measures of relationship quality. There is also some initial evidence that MRE for low-income couples can decrease divorce rates, reduce aggression, and improve children’s problem behaviors.&lt;ref name="works"&gt;Hawkins, Alan; Ooms, Theodora. "What Works in Marriage and Relationship Education," National Healthy Marriage Resource Center, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Washington, D.C.[http://www.healthymarriageinfo.org/resource-detail/index.aspx?rid=2861]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Supporting Healthy Marriage Study====

In August 2012, Manpower Development Research Corporation (MDRC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdrc.org] MDRC website&lt;/ref&gt; a nonprofit, nonpartisan social policy research organization, reported that a federally funded, multi-year, random assignment, control group study known as the [[Supporting Healthy Marriage Project]] found high levels of consumer satisfaction among 4,989 adults participating in relationship education courses based on the work of PREP Inc., [[PAIRS Foundation]] and [[John Gottman]] at sites in Florida (Orlando), Kansas (Wichita), Pennsylvania (Reading and Bethlehem), Texas (El Paso and San Antonio), New York (Bronx), Oklahoma (Oklahoma City), and Washington (Shoreline and Seattle).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2012/10/17/national-marriage-education-study-117] "National Study Shows Strong Consumer Satisfaction with Marriage and Relationship Education Classes," Fatherhood Channel, October 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A 12-month report on the program's impact found:&lt;ref name=knox&gt;Knox, Virginia, et al. "Early Impacts from the Supporting Healthy Marriage Evaluation," MDRC, New York, NY, March 2012.[http://www.mdrc.org/early-impacts-supporting-healthy-marriage-evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SHM PAIRS Couple.jpg|thumb|Couple practices communication skills during [[PAIRS Foundation]] relationship education class in Florida.]]

* The SHM program produced a consistent pattern of small positive effects on multiple aspects of couples’ relationships. Relative to the control group, the program group showed higher levels of marital happiness, lower levels of marital distress, greater warmth and support, more positive communication, and fewer negative behaviors and emotions in their interactions with their spouses. The consistency of results across outcomes and data sources (surveys and independent observations of couple interactions) is noteworthy.
* Compared with individuals in the control group, program group members reported experiencing slightly less psychological and physical abuse from their spouses. Men and women in the program group reported less psychological abuse in their relationships, and men in the program group reported that their spouses physically assaulted them less often, compared with their control group counterparts.
* Men and women in the program group reported slightly lower levels of adult psychological distress (such as feelings of sadness or anxiety) than their control group counterparts.
* The program did not significantly affect whether couples stayed married at the 12-month follow-up point.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49661">"'''Right to know'''", in the context of United States workplace and community [[environmental law]], is the legal principle that the individual has the right to know the chemicals to which they may be exposed in their daily living. It is embodied in [[United States federal law|federal]] law in the [[United States]] as well as in [[Local government|local]] laws in several states. "Right to Know" laws take two forms: Community Right to Know and Workplace Right to Know.  Each grants certain rights to those groups. The "right to know" was a movement made popular by [[Rachel Carson]] with her book ''[[Silent Spring]]''.&lt;ref name="carson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carson|first=Rachel|title=Silent Spring|year=1962|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|pages=13, 278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental illness shares characteristics with common diseases. For example, [[cyanide]] exposure symptoms include weakness, headache, nausea, confusion, dizziness, seizures, cardiac arrest, and unconsciousness.&lt;ref name="Pesticide User's Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohioline.osu.edu/b745/b745_4.html|title=Pesticide User's Guide|publisher=Ohio State University|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901101226/http://ohioline.osu.edu/b745/b745_4.html|archivedate=2011-09-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Facts About Cyanides"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.state.ny.us/environmental/emergency/chemical_terrorism/cyanide_general.htm|title=The Facts About Cyanides|publisher=New York Department of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Influenza]] and [[heart disease]] include the same symptoms. Cyanide is one of the most toxic known substances, and failure to obtain proper disclosure is likely to lead to improper or ineffective medical diagnosis and treatment. This can contribute to prolonged illness and death.

Hazardous substances used outside buildings must be disclosed to the appropriate state or local agency responsible for [http://www.epa.gov/epahome/state.htm State Environmental Protection Agency]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/epahome/state.htm|title= State Environmental Protection Agency|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; regulatory actions outside federal land.

The Department of Defense is self-regulating, and as such, is immune to state and federal law pertaining to OSHA and EPA regulations on foreign and domestic soil.

=== OSHA ===
Occupational Health and Safety is managed within most states under federal authority.
* [http://www.osha.gov/dcsp/osp/index.html State Occupational Safety and Health Plans]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/dcsp/osp/index.html|title=State Occupational Safety and Health Plans|publisher=Occupational Health and Safety Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workplace safety and health in the U.S. operates under the framework established by the federal [[Occupational Safety and Health Act]] of 1970 (OSH Act). 

The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) within the U.S. Department of Labor is responsible for issuing and enforcing regulations covering workplace safety. 

The [[Department of Transportation]] is responsible for transportation safety and for maintaining the list of hazardous materials.

The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] is responsible for maintaining lists of specific hazardous materials.

=== EPA ===

Environmental health and safety outside the workplace is established by the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which is managed by the EPA and various state and local government agencies.
* [http://www.epa.gov/epahome/r2k.htm Learn about Your Right to Know]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/epahome/r2k.htm|title=Learn about Your Right to Know|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State and local agencies maintain [[epidemiology]] information required by physicians to evaluate environmental illness.

Air quality information must be provided by pest control supervisors under license requirements established by the [[Worker Protection Standard]] when [[restricted use pesticide]] is applied.

The list of restricted use pesticides is maintained by the US EPA.
* [http://www.epa.gov/opprd001/rup/ Restricted Use Products (RUP) Report]&lt;ref name="epa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/opprd001/rup/|title=Restricted Use Products (RUP) Report|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, specific environmental pollutants are identified in public law, which extends to all hazardous substances even if the item is not identified as a restricted use pesticide by the EPA. As an example, [[cyfluthrin]], [[cypermethrin]], and cynoff contain cyanide, which is one of the most toxic known substances, but some of the products that contain these chemicals may not be identified as restricted-use pesticides.
* [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7412- Title 42 U.S.C. Section 7412 identifies the list of environmental pollutants.]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7412-|title=Title 42 U.S.C. Section 7412.|publisher=Cornell School of Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some specific chemicals, such as cyaniate, cyanide, cyano, and [[nitrile]] compounds, satisfy the specific hazard definition that is identified in public law regardless of whether or not the item is identified on the list of restricted use pesticides maintained by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
* [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7413- Title 42 U.S.C. Section 7413 contains the reporting requirement for environmental pollutants.]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7413-|title=Title 42 U.S.C. Section 7413.|publisher=Cornell School of Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most developed countries have similar regulatory practices. [http://www.eea.europa.eu/ Pesticides and insecticides interests in the European Union are managed by the European Environmental Protection Agency.]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/|title=European Environmental Protection Agency|publisher=European Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental illness share characteristics with common diseases. For example, cyanide exposure symptoms include weakness, headache, nausea, confusion, dizziness, seizures, cardiac arrest, and unconsciousness.&lt;ref name="Pesticide User's Guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Facts About Cyanides"/&gt; [[Influenza]] and [[heart disease]] include the same symptoms.

Failure to obtain proper disclosure that is required by physicians will result in improper, ineffective, or delayed medical diagnosis and treatment for environmental illness caused by exposure to hazardous substance and by exposure to radiation.

===DOT===

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20120216045958/http://phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat/library Library Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration within the Department of Transportation] is responsible for maintaining the list of hazardous materials within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat/library|title=Library|publisher=Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration; Department of Transportation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216045958/http://phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat/library|archivedate=2012-02-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All hazardous materials that are not created at the work site must be transported by motor vehicle. The safety and security of the public transportation system is enforced by Department of Transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety-security/safety-security.htm|title=Safety and Security|publisher=Department of Transportation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Department of Transportation]] regulates mandatory labeling requirements for all [[hazardous materials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety-security/hazmat/complyhmregs.htm|title=How to Comply with Federal Hazardous Materials Regulations|publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration; Department of Transportation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in addition to requirements by other federal agencies, like the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]].

DOT is responsible for enforcement actions and public notification regarding hazardous chemical releases and exposures, including incidents involving federal workers. 
* [http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety-security/hazmat/complyhmregs.htm How to Comply with Federal Hazardous Materials Regulations]

DOT requires that all buildings and vehicles containing hazardous materials must have signs that disclose specific types of hazards for [[certified first responder]].

===DOE===

Safety of certain workers is governed by the Department of Energy, such as mine workers. Public information can be obtained in the form of directives.
* [https://www.directives.doe.gov/ Department of Energy Directives]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.directives.doe.gov/|title=Departmental Directives|publisher=Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DOD===

The [[United States Department of Defense]] manages environmental safety independent of OSHA and EPA. Spills, mishaps, illnesses, and injuries are not normally handled in accordance with local, state, and federal law.

Failure to administer discipline for illegal activity occurring within a military command is considered to be '''[[dereliction of duty]]''', which is administered under the '''[[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]'''.

Individuals with information about environmental crimes and individuals with environmental injuries involving the military should become familiar with the topic of [[Whistleblower protection in United States]]. Government employees, government contractors, and military officers often lack the training, education, licensing, and experience required to understand the legal requirements involving environmental safety. The sophistication required to understand legal requirements is not normally required for promotion and contractor selection within the military.

Because of this, specific rules are documented in orders and directives that need to be written in plain language intended to be understood by people that have a 4th grade reading ability.

Law are enforced by the [[commanding officer]] in military organizations. The commanding officer typically has the ability to read and understand written requirements. A [[Flag Officer]] is subject to [[Court-martial]] action if laws or government policies are violated under their command when the activity is outside the scope of '''mission orders''' and '''[[rules of engagement]]'''. Each commanding officer is responsible for writing and maintaining policies simple enough to be understood by everyone in their command. Each commanding officer is responsible for ensuring that command policy documents are made available to every person in their command (civilian, military, and contractor). The commanding officer is responsible for disciplinary action and public disclosures when policies are violated within their command. 

The commanding officer shares responsibilities for crimes that are not punished (dereliction).

Military agencies operate independently of law enforcement, judicial authority, and [[common law]]. Similar exemptions exist for some state agencies.

Potential crimes are investigated by [[Military_police#United_States|military police]]. The following is an example of the kinds of policy documents used to conduct criminal investigations.
* [http://www.ig.navy.mil/Documents/Investigations%20Manual%20(word)/Investigations%20Manual.pdf Naval Inspector General; Investigations Manual]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ig.navy.mil/Documents/Investigations%20Manual%20(word)/Investigations%20Manual.pdf|title=Naval Inspector General; Investigations Manual|publisher=Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of the Navy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because military law enforcement is performed with no independent civilian oversight, there is an inherent '''[[conflict of interest]]'''. Information and disclosures are obtained through Freedom of Information Act request and not through disclosures ordinarily associated with the EPA and OSHA that have the competency required for training, certification, disclosure, and enforcement. This prevents physicians from obtaining the kind of information needed to diagnose and treat environmental illness, so the root cause for environmental illness typically remains permanently unknown. The following organization may help when the root cause for an illness remains unknown longer than 30 days.

=== Available information ===
The information described in this section is for the United States, but most countries have similar regulatory requirements.

Two mandatory documents must provide hazard information for most toxic products.
* Product Label
* [[Material Safety Data Sheet]]

Product label requirements are established by the [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]] under the authority of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]. As a minimum this requires information about the chemical makeup of the product, instructions required for the safe use of the product, and contact information for the manufacturer of the product.
* [http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_02/40cfrv20_02.html Title 40 CFR --Protection of Environment (parts 150 to 189) CHAPTER I--ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_02/40cfrv20_02.html|title=Title 40 CFR --Protection of Environment (parts 150 to 189) CHAPTER I--ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY|publisher=United States Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Material Safety Data Sheet]] is required under the authority of the United States [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] for hazardous materials to communicate health and safety risks needed by health care professionals and emergency responders.

Chemical information is most frequently associated with the right to know but there are many other types of information that are important to workplace safety and health. The following sources of information are those most likely to be found at the workplace or in state or federal agencies with jurisdiction over the workplace:
*Injury and illness records which employers are required to keep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10027|title=Access to employee exposure and medical records|publisher=Occupational Health and Safety Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Accident investigation reports.
*Workers’ compensation claim forms and records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/workcomp/index.htm|title=Federal Workers Compensation|publisher=United States Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dfec/regs/compliance/wc.htm|title=State Workers Compensation|publisher=United States Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Material safety data sheets (MSDS) and labels for hazardous chemicals used or present in the workplace.
*Chemical inventories required by federal and state regulations.
*Records of monitoring and measurement of worker exposure to chemicals, noise, radiation, or other hazards.
*Workplace inspection reports, whether done by a safety committee, employer safety and health personnel, OR-OSHA insurance carriers, fire departments, or other outside agencies.
*Job safety analysis, including ergonomic evaluations of jobs or workstations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/sbs.html|title=Sick Building Syndrome|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Employee medical records or studies or evaluations based on these records.
*OSHA standards and the background data on which they are based.

==== Hazard Communication (HazCom 2012) ====
'''''Note:''' Refer to 29 CFR 1910.1200 for the most current and updated information'' (https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=10099)

The '''[[Hazard Communication Standard]]'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10099 HazCom] (29 CFR1910.1200)&lt;/ref&gt; first went into effect in 1985 and has since been expanded to cover almost all workplaces under OSHA jurisdiction. The details of the Hazard Communication standard are rather complicated, but the basic idea behind it is straightforward. It requires chemical manufacturers and employers to communicate information to workers about the hazards of workplace chemicals or products, including training.

The Hazard Communication standard does not specify how much training a worker must receive. Instead, it defines what the training must cover. Employers must conduct training in a language comprehensible to employees to be in compliance with the standard. It also states that workers must be trained at the time of initial assignment and whenever a new hazard is introduced into their work area. The purpose for this is so that workers can understand the hazards they face and so that they are aware of the protective measures that should be in place.
It is very difficult to get a good understanding of chemical hazards and particularly to be able to read MSDSs in the short amount of time that many companies devote to hazard communication training. When OSHA conducts an inspection, the inspector will evaluate the effectiveness of the training by reviewing records of what training was done and by interviewing employees who use chemicals to find out what they understand about the hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=10099|title=Toxic and Hazardous Substances; Hazard Communication|publisher=United States Department of Labor; Occupational Health and Safety Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Transportation]] (DOT) regulates hazmat transportation within the territory of the US by ''[[Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations]]''.&lt;ref name="49FR"&gt;{{cite web|title=49 FR|url=http://hazmat.dot.gov/regs/rules.htm|publisher=[[United States Department of Transportation]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519000918/http://hazmat.dot.gov/regs/rules.htm|archivedate=2008-05-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dangerous Goods]]

All chemical manufacturers and importers must assess the hazards of the chemicals they produce and import and pass this information on to transportation workers and purchasers through labels and [[material safety data sheets]] (MSDSs). Employers whose employees may be exposed to hazardous chemicals on the job must provide hazardous chemical information to those employees through the use of MSDSs, properly labeled containers, training, and a written hazard communication program. This standard also requires the employer to maintain a list of all hazardous chemicals used in the workplace. The MSDSs for these chemicals must be kept current and they must be made available and accessible to employees in their work areas.

Chemicals that may pose health risks or those that are physical hazards (such as fire or explosion) are covered. List of chemicals that are considered hazardous are maintained according to the use or purpose. There are several existing sources that manufacturers and employers may consult. These include:
*Any substance for which OSHA has a standard in force, including any substance listed in the Air Contaminants regulation.
*Substances listed as [[carcinogens]] (causing cancer) by the [[National Toxicology Program]] (NTP) or the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC).
*Substances listed in the Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances and Physical Agents, published by the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] (ACGIH).
*[http://www.epa.gov/opprd001/rup/ Restricted Use Products (RUP) Report; EPA]&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt;

Ultimately, it is up to the manufacturer to disclose hazards.

There are other sources of information about chemicals used in industry as a result of state and federal laws regarding the Community Right to Know Act. 

The [http://www.arb.ca.gov/capcoa/roster.htm Air Resources Board] is responsible for public hazard disclosures in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/capcoa/roster.htm|title=California Local Air District Directory|publisher=California}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pesticide use disclosures are made by each pest control supervisor to the County Agricultural Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/county/comenu.htm/|title=County Agricultural Commissioner Resources|publisher=California Department of Pesticide Regulation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306064229/http://cdpr.ca.gov/docs/county/comenu.htm|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epidemiology]] information is available from the [http://calpip.cdpr.ca.gov/ California Pesticide Information Portal], which can be used by health care professionals to identify the cause for environmental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calpip.cdpr.ca.gov/|title=California Pesticide Information Portal|publisher=California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Oregon Community Right to Know Act (ORS 453.307-372) and the federal Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) Title III, the Office of the State [[Fire Marshal]] collects information on hazardous substances and makes it available to emergency responders and to the general public. Among the information which companies must report are:
*Inventories of amounts and types of hazardous substances stored in their facilities.
*Annual inventories of toxic chemicals released during normal operations.
*Emergency notification of accidental releases of certain chemicals listed by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The information can be obtained in the form of an annual report of releases for the state or for specific companies. It is available on request from the Fire Marshal’s Office and is normally free of charge unless unusually large quantities of data are involved.

==== Chemical labeling requirements ====
Each container that contains a hazardous chemical must be labeled by the manufacturer or distributor before it is sent to downstream users. There is no single standard format for labels. Each product must be labeled according to the specific type of hazard.

Pesticide and fungicide labeling is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oppfead1/labeling/lrm/|title=Label Review Manual - Table of Contents|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The identity of the hazardous chemical(s) by common or chemical name.
*Appropriate hazard warnings.
*The name and address of the manufacturer, distributor, or the responsible party.
*Product use instructions

Your employer is required to inform you of:
*The requirements of the Hazard Communication rules.
*The operations in your work area where hazardous materials are present.
*The location of the written hazard communication program, the list of hazardous chemicals, and the MSDSs of chemicals that you will be exposed to.
In addition, these items must be covered in training:
*Methods to detect the presence of hazardous chemicals.
*Physical and health hazards of the chemicals.
*Protective measures, including work practices, ventilation, personal protective equipment, and emergency procedures.
*How to read and understand labels and MSDSs.
*The hazards of non-routine tasks, such as the cleaning of tanks or other vessels, or breaking into lines containing chemicals.

==== Safety Data Sheet (SDS): ''Formerly known as Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) as per OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard'' ====
Note: Refer to 29 CFR 1910.1200 for the most current and updated information (https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=10099)

[[MSDS]]s are often hard to figure out, even for trained safety professionals. MSDS information is required by EPA, OSHA, DOT, and/or DOE regulations depending upon the type of hazardous substance. The Material Safety Data Sheet includes the following information.
#Product identity and ingredients by chemical or common name.
#Physical and chemical characteristics.
#Physical hazards, such as fire and explosion.
#Health hazards, including symptoms.
#Primary routes of entry of the chemical into the body.
#Legal exposure limits (OSHA and other recommended limits).
#Whether the chemical can cause cancer.
#Precautions for safe handling and use.
#Control measures, including ventilation, personal protective equipment, etc.
#Emergency and first aid procedures.
#The date the MSDS was prepared.
#Name, address, and phone number of the manufacturer.
#Regulatory agencies, such as [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] EPA SARA Title III rules [[EPCRA]]

Chemical manufacturers may legally withhold the specific chemical identity of a material from the MSDS and label in the case of bona fide trade secrets. In such cases the following rules apply:
*The MSDS must indicate that trade secret information is being withheld.
*The MSDS must disclose information concerning the properties and effects of the hazardous chemical, even if the actual chemical identity is withheld.
*The trade secret information must be disclosed to a doctor or nurse in a medical emergency.
*In non-emergency cases health professionals can obtain a trade secret chemical identity if they can show they need it for purposes of health protection and if they sign a confidentiality agreement.

==== Exposure records ====
The Hazard Communication standard requires that chemical information must be transmitted to employees who work with hazardous materials. Employee exposure records can tell if a worker is actually being exposed to a chemical or physical hazard and how much exposure he or she is receiving.  OSHA regulations that establish access rights to these records are found in [http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10027 29 CFR 1910.1020: Access to Medical and Exposure Records].&lt;ref name="OSHA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10027|title=Toxic and Hazardous Substances; Access to employee exposure and medical records|publisher=OSHA}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information is usually the product of some type of monitoring or measurement for:
*Dusts, fumes, or gases in the air.
*Absorption of a chemical into the body, e.g. blood lead levels.
*Noise exposure.
*Radiation exposure.
*Spores, fungi, or other biological contaminants.

Employees and their designated representatives have the right under OR-OSHA regulations to examine or copy exposure records that are in the possession of the employer. This right applies not only to records of an employee’s own exposure to chemical, physical, or biological agents but also to exposure records of other employees whose working conditions are similar to the employee’s. Union representatives have the right to see records for any work areas in which the union represents employees.

In addition to seeing the results, employees and their representatives also have the right to observe the actual measurement of hazardous chemical or noise exposure.

Exposure records that are part of an OR-OSHA inspection file are also accessible to employees and union representatives. In fact these files, with the exception of certain confidential information, are open to the public after the inspection has been legally closed out.

==== Medical record ====
Many employers keep some type of [[medical record]]s. These could be medical questionnaires, results of pre-employment physical examinations, results from blood tests or more elaborate records of ongoing diagnosis or treatment (such as all biological monitoring not defined as an employee exposure record). OSHA regulations that establish access rights to these records are found in [http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10027 29 CFR 1910.1020: Access to Medical and Exposure Records].&lt;ref name="OSHA"/&gt;

Medical records are considerably more personal than exposure records or accident reports so the rules governing confidentiality and access to them are stricter. Employee medical records do not include a lot of employee medical information because of this extra scrutiny. A good rule of thumb is that if the information is maintained separately from the employer's medical program, it probably will not be accessible.

Examples of separately maintained medical information would be records of voluntary employee assistance programs (alcohol, drug abuse, or personal counseling programs), medical records concerning health insurance claims or records created solely in preparation for litigation.

These records are often kept at the worksite if there is an on-site physician or nurse. They could also be in the files of a physician, clinic, or hospital with whom the employer contracts for medical services.

An employee has access to his or her own medical record (29 CFR 1910.1020). An individual employee may also sign a written release authorizing a designated representative (such as a union representative) to receive access to his or her medical record. The latter might occur in a case where the union or a physician or other researcher working for the union or employer needs medical information on a whole group of workers to document a health problem. Certain confidential information may be deleted from an employee’s record before it is released.

==Past and future==
The push towards a greater availability of information came from events killed many and infected others with toxins, such as the [[Bhopal disaster]] in India in December 1984. During the Bhopal disaster, a cloud of [[methyl isocyanate]] escaped an insecticide plant due to neglect, and as a result, 2,000 people were killed and many more were injured. The plant had been already noted for their poor safety record and lack of evacuation or emergency plan. The lack of awareness and knowledge in the community about the dangers led to this disaster, which could have been avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umass.edu/sts/ethics/bhopal.html|title=IDEESE: Cases - Bhopal Plant Disaster|publisher=University of Massachusetts, Amherst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after, the Emergency Planning and Right to Know Act of 1986, originally introduced by California Democrat [[Henry Waxman]], was passed. This act was the first official step taken to helping people become more educated in the field of corporation's pollutants and their actions. The act issued a requirement for industrial facilities across the U.S. to disclose information on their annual releases of toxic chemicals. This data collected is made available by the Environmental Protection Agency in the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) which is open to public knowledge. This was noticed as a step in the right direction however, only pounds of individual pollutants were required to be released as a result of this act. No information about toxicity, spread, or overlap had been required to be shared with the public.

In years to come, the public would achieve greater ways of accessing the information that corporations with excess pollutants withheld. The Toxic 100 is a form of newer information which is a list that includes one hundred companies industrial air polluters in the United States that are ranked by the quantity of pollution they produce and the toxicity of the pollutants. This data is determined by the [[Political Economy Research Institute]] (PERI) and calculated with factors such as winds caring the pollution, height of smokestacks, and how much it impacts nearby communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/toxic100/|title=Toxic 100|publisher=Public Economy Research Institute, University of Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Russeting''' or '''russetting''' is an abnormality of [[fruit]] skin which manifests in [[russet (color)|russet]]-colored (brownish) patches that are rougher than healthy skin. It is a common feature in [[apple]]s and [[pear]]s. Russeting is typically an undesirable trait, which reduces the storage life of fruits and makes their appearance unattractive to consumers,&lt;ref name=Lashbrooke&gt;{{cite journal|title=Genome investigation suggests ''MdSHN3'', an APETALA2-domain transcription factor gene, to be a positive regulator of apple fruit cuticle formation and an inhibitor of russet development |last1=Lashbrooke |first1=J. |last2=Aharoni |first2=A. |last3=Costa |first3=F. |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Botany]] |year=2015 |issue=21 |volume=66 |pages=6579–89 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erv366 |pmc=4623677 |pmid=26220084}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some cultivars, so-called [[russet apple]]s, are appreciated for the feature. 

==Causes==
In apples and pears, russet results from micro-cracking of the [[plant cuticle|cuticle]], the outer epidermal layer of the fruit. The cuticle is a natural waterproof barrier composed of a polymerized cutin matrix embedded with waxes, which protects the fruit from outside stresses, and helps maintain post-harvest preservation. When the cuticle cracks, a [[cork (material)|corky]] [[suberized]] layer is formed on the fruit skin.&lt;ref name=Lashbrooke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Opara&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Jules |editor-first=Janick|title=Horticultural Reviews |volume=55 |chapter=Fruit Skin Splitting and Cracking |last1=Opara |first1=Linus U. |last2=Studman |first2=Clifford J. |last3=Banks |first3=Nigel H. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdVY1nF_BjkC&amp;pg=PA225|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-65061-5|pages=225–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apples are particularly susceptible to russet. Many naturally-occurring varieties exhibit the feature consistently, while other cultivars may develop russet due to environmental stresses. As a result, cuticular structure is impaired, leading to reduced strength of the peel, which impacts handling and post-harvest processing. Russeting and cuticular cracks may accelerate the development of flesh browning due to oxidation, as well as softening of internal tissue due to the loss of an external support.&lt;ref name=Lashbrooke/&gt;

{{see also|Seriality}}
'''Seriality''' or '''serial collectivity''' is a term that [[feminist]] scholar [[Iris Marion Young]] used to describe a reconceptualization of the category of [[woman]] in her 1994 essay ''Gender as Seriality''. [[Iris Marion Young|Young]] borrows the concept of [[seriality]] from [[Sartre]]'s ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]'', where he originally developed the idea to describe the relationship of individuals to social classes and the capitalist system of production and consumption. Understanding women as a ''series'', rather than a ''group'', entails the recognition that the category ''woman'' is not defined by any common biological or psychological characteristics; rather, individuals are positioned as ''woman'' by a set of material and immaterial social constructs that are the product of previous human actions.

==Group vs series==

A group, in [[Sartre]]'s definition, is a collection of people who self-consciously recognize themselves to be in a unified relationship with each other in the undertaking of a common project. A mutual acknowledgment of actively shared goals is the chief feature of a group. Guilds, reading groups, addiction support groups and animal cruelty prevention groups are all examples of groups.

Seriality, in contrast to the active effort of group being, describes a level of social existence that is habitually constrained and directed by existing circumstances and material conditions.
In a series, a collection of people are unified ''passively'' by objects, routines practices and habits around which their actions are oriented. For instance, people waiting in line for a bus, radio listeners, prison inmates and [[street theatre]] spectators are all examples of series. In each example, individuals are oriented toward the same goals by their response to existing conditions and structures in the environment, which are the collective legacy of human actions and decisions in the past. To illustrate concretely, the actions of people who stop and watch a street theatre performance may be shaped by existing conditions which constrain and permit their actions, such as the social acceptability of staging a performance on the street, the attractive costumes of the performers, high unemployment rates among actors, the existence of a public square, social expectations of their roles as spectators. Members of a series are anonymous and isolated, although not alone, often individuals in a series take into account the expected behavior of other members when pursuing their own actions – for instance, a bus rider may choose to avoid rush hour traffic. Members of a series are also interchangeable, although not identical, in relation to the objects that effect their serialized condition: from the point of view of a radio program broadcaster, one listener is interchangeable with another.

Groups and series are related in that groups arise out of a backdrop of seriality, and disperse to fall back into serialized conditions. In other words, groups are the product of individuals' response to shared conditions; Young gives the example of commuters at a bus stop who, when the bus fails to appear, organize themselves into a group to hail taxis, complain to the bus company, etc.

==Seriality as a solution to a conceptual dilemma in feminism==

Young's reconceptualization of ''women'' as a ''series'' is an attempt to provide a solution to the problems in [[feminist]] discourse surrounding the grouping of all [[women]] in a single category. This problem exists as a dilemma between two conflicting positions: &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Iris Marion|date=1994-04-01|title=Gender as Seriality: Thinking about Women as a Social Collective|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/494918|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=19|issue=3|pages=713–738|doi=10.1086/494918|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

i) On one hand, it is important to be able to speak of [[women]] as a group for practical political reasons. Feminist politics is organized around this category of ''woman''; its existence as a movement fundamentally depends on this conceptualization. Additionally, the category of ''women'' is necessary in order to understand [[oppression]] and disadvantage as something that is systematically inflicted upon women (or any societal group) in a structured, [[institution]]alized process, as opposed to being a natural or unique condition. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

ii) On the other hand, the category of ''woman'' is fraught with problems of essentialization, [[normalization (sociology)|normalization]] and exclusion. As [[Elizabeth Spelman]] points out, social categories are [[social construct|constructs]] that carry latent expressions of privilege and subordination; in this manner, feminist theories have often assumed the experience of white, [[middle-class]] [[heterosexual]] women as representative for all women, excluding less privileged points of view. [[Chandra Talpade Mohanty|Chandra Mohanty]] suggests that the category of ''woman'' creates the false impression of a coherent, homogeneous group, which leads to the mistake of assuming that all women are equally powerless and oppressed, rather than generating specific questions about oppression that can be empirically investigated. [[Judith Butler]] goes as far as to argue that the very act of defining such a gender category is what produces the [[normalization (sociology)|normalizations]] that privilege some viewpoints and exclude others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Thinking of ''woman'' as a series solves these conceptual problems. It allows one to meaningfully use the category while avoiding the mistake of falsely [[essentialism|essentializing]] women as a group. An [[essentialist]] approach attempts to define ''woman'' by common biological characteristics – evidently false when one considers, for instance, [[transgender]], [[bigender]] or [[intersex]] people, for instance – or by finding commonality in the vast diversity of women's actual lives, clearly not a viable enterprise.
A serial conception of ''woman'' also disconnects the idea of gender from an individual's personal identity, as it defines gender as a pre-existing set of societal forces that are visited upon each individual; this approach does not make any claims about the way individuals respond to these pressures. Indeed, the conception of gender as seriality derives its strength from precisely the fact that it does not attempt a comprehensive definition of the individual, but acknowledges that individuals exist within structures that constrain and channel their actions in particular ways.

==Other potential applications of seriality==

[[Iris Marion Young|Young]] has suggested that the concept of seriality might also be usefully applied to relationships of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[nationality]] as linkages which also result from historical conditions – such as the institution of [[slavery]] and projects of [[nation-building]] – which also function to limit and enable individuals' actions on the level of everyday life and habit.

[[File:Dr. Robert Hazen.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;[[Robert Hazen|Dr. Robert Hazen]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

As the Clarence B. Robinson Professor at [[George Mason University]], [[Robert Hazen]] developed innovative courses to promote [[scientific literacy]] in both scientists and non-scientists.&lt;ref name=DistinguishedPresentation&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hemley|first1=R.

== Reception ==
A fan of the overall series of [[The Great Courses]] is [[Bill Gates]], who said the courses have "incredible professors" who cover "every topic that you can think of".&lt;ref name="TIME-20180104"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gates |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Gates |title=The 4 Learning Hacks Bill Gates Swears By |url=http://time.com/5066247/bill-gates-learning-hacks/ |date=4 January 2018 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=9 May 2018 |quote=... One of my favorite sources for interesting lectures is The Teaching Company. They get incredible professors to teach courses on pretty much every topic you can think of.

'''The Plant List''' is a list of [[botanical name]]s of species of plants created by the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] and the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]] and launched in 2010.&lt;ref name="discovery news"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.discovery.com/earth/plant-database-library-101229.html | title=World's Largest Plants Database Assembled | publisher=[[Discovery News|discovery.com]] | date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended to be a comprehensive record of all known names of plant species over time.

There is a complementary project called the [[International Plant Names Index]], in which Kew is also involved.  The IPNI aims to provide details of publication and does not aim to determine which are accepted species names. Newly published names are automatically added from IPNI to the [[World Checklist of Selected Plant Families]], a database which underlies the Plant List.

==Findings==
The Plant List has 1,064,035 scientific [[plant]] names of [[species]] rank.&lt;ref name="The Plant List"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theplantlist.org/ | title=Summary Statistics | work=The Plant List | accessdate=June 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 350,699 are accepted species names, belonging to 642 plant [[Family (biology)|families]] and 17,020 plant [[genus|genera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/cp/science/i81521.html|title=US, British scientists drew up the comprehensive list of world's known land plants|publisher=CBC }} {{Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Plant List accepts approximately 350,699 unique species, with 470,624 [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]]s for those species, which suggests that many species have been referred to under more than one name.  {{As of|2014}}, The Plant List has determined that another 243,000 names are 'unresolved', meaning that botanists have so far been unable to determine whether they are a separate species or a duplication of the 350,699 unique species.

==Public attention==
When The Plant List was launched in 2010 (the [[International Year of Biodiversity]]), it attracted media attention for its comprehensive approach. [[Fox News]] highlighted the number of synonyms encountered, suggesting that this reflected a "surprising lack" of biodiversity on earth."&lt;ref name="Fox News"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/12/30/worlds-plant-life-far-diverse-previously-thought/#ixzz19t9BPqzQ|title=World's Plant Life Far Less Diverse Than Previously Thought|publisher=Fox News | date=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Plant List also attracted attention for building on the work of [[English people|English]] [[natural history|naturalist]] [[Charles Darwin]], who in the 1880s started a plant list called the [[Index Kewensis]] (IK).
Kew has added an average of 6,000 species every year since the IK was first published with 400,000 names of species.&lt;ref name="Fox News"/&gt;  However, the IK (which by 1913 avoided making taxonomic judgement in its citations) is currently run as part of the IPNI rather than the Plant List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://www.ipni.org/ik_blurb.html  | title = About the Index Kewensis  | accessdate =  | author =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | date =   | year = 2004  | month =   | work =   | publisher = [[International Plant Names Index]]  | quote =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5497">The '''Thomas More Institute''' (TMI) is a secular academic institution located in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada that offers a program of university level studies in the [[liberal arts]]. There is an option to earn a Bachelor of Arts in affiliation with [[Bishop's University]].

== History ==
TMI was founded in Montreal in 1945 by a group of people, most of them in their twenties, including [[Charlotte Tansey]], Martin O'Hara, Stan Machnik, and Veronica Smyth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2dEtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3EgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=tansey%20machnik&amp;pg=2269%2C586577 "Spirit of Girl in Twenties Spells Success for Adult Education Inst."], ''Manitoba Ensign'', February 4, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Fitterman, [http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20100906.OBCHARLOTTTETANSEYATL/BDAStory/BDA/deaths "Dedicated to the pursuit of lifelong learning: Founder of Thomas More Institute for Adult Education had fierce vision and passion for knowledge]", ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', September 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim was to provide opportunities for lifelong learning and liberal arts education for adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview|url=http://www.thomasmore.qc.ca/about-2/overview/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915102954/http://www.thomasmore.qc.ca/about-2/overview/|archivedate=2013-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, TMI established the Workers' School, which offered evening classes in "Human Rights and Labour Unions," "The Rise of Labour Movements," and "Talking at Meetings," training workers to become union members.  The Institute received a federal charter in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a0wwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fagFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=thomas-more-institute&amp;pg=5401%2C4209821 "Thomas More Institute Gets Federal Charter"], ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'', May 20, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, annually, the Institute has more than 600 registrations and 35-40 new courses. The adult students are of all ages, from those in their early 20s to several over 90 years of age.

== Teaching method ==
TMI’s teaching is inspired by the [[Socratic method]]. Instead of lectures, TMI offers discussions guided by trained leaders and based upon carefully chosen and sequenced texts representing different perspectives on the questions each group has come together to explore. 
Although they may have special knowledge in a particular field the leaders do not lecture; the text is the professor. The discussion team only asks questions to channel the conversation.  Participants learn to listen to one another; people of all ages and all backgrounds coming together to exchange their views on what a reading means to them. TMI’s method requires critical thinking, clear references to common terms, and respect for alternate views. The challenge in TMI courses is not for students to agree, or come to a consensus, but to embrace new ways of thinking that go beyond individual bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teaching Philosophy|url=http://www.thomasmore.qc.ca/about-2/teaching-philosophy/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916080355/http://www.thomasmore.qc.ca/about-2/teaching-philosophy/|archivedate=2013-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Seniors' Outreach Program ==
In 1977, TMI launched an outreach program to take courses to seniors’ residences and centres in response to some of the Institute’s original discussion leaders and students no longer having the mobility to come to courses downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seniors' Program|url=http://www.thomasmore.qc.ca/courses/seniors-program/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915102449/http://www.thomasmore.qc.ca/courses/seniors-program/|archivedate=2013-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program continues to organize discussion groups on history, literature, science, and other liberal arts topics in residences and meeting places of older adults throughout the Montreal area.

== Lonergan ==
[[Bernard Lonergan]], the Canadian philosopher, theologian, and economist, taught at TMI (beginning with a 1945 lecture series called "Thought and Reality"&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QokxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=naUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=thomas-more-institute&amp;pg=1494%2C2598168 "Thomas More Institute is 40 Years Old"], ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'', August 18, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederick E. Crowe, ''Developing the Lonergan Legacy: Historical, Theoretical, and Existential Themes'' ([[University of Toronto Press]], 2004), {{ISBN|978-0802089380}}, p.44 &amp; passim.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=wOSrpMSUm6QC&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;ots=vmSth8LCgX&amp;dq=%22Thomas%20More%20Institute%22%20%22thought%20and%20reality%22%201945&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Thomas%20More%20Institute%22%20&amp;f=false Excerpts available] at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;) and significantly shaped the learning and questioning experience offered by the Institute. TMI is also home to a large collection of Lonergan documents, including lecture notes and audio tapes, which are being digitized with the help of the [http://www.lonergan-lri.ca/ Lonergan Research Institute]. Every fall, TMI organizes a Listening to Lonergan lecture series, co-sponsored by [[Concordia University]] and the Thomas More Research Institute.

This dye imparts a brick-red color to intact, noninfarcted myocardium where the dehydrogenase activity is preserved. Because dehydrogenases are depleted in the area of ischemic necrosis (i.e., they leak out through the damaged cell membranes), an infarcted area is revealed as an unstained pale zone. Instead of a triphenyltetrazolium chloride dye, a LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) dye can also be used to visualize an area of necrosis.&lt;/ref&gt; ||

'''Vacuum engineering''' deals with technological processes and equipment that use [[vacuum]] to achieve better results than those run under atmospheric [[pressure]]. The most widespread applications of vacuum technology are:
* [[Pyrolytic chromium carbide coating]]
* [[Antireflecting]] glass
* [[Glass colouring]]
* [[Vacuum impregnation]]
* [[Vacuum coating]]
* [[Vacuum drying]]

[[Vacuum coaters]] are capable of applying various types of coatings on [[metal]], [[glass]], [[plastic]] or [[ceramic]] surfaces, providing high quality and uniform thickness and color. [[Vacuum dryers]] can be used for delicate materials and save significant quantities of energy due to lower drying temperatures.

==Design and mechanism==
Vacuum systems usually consist of gauges, vapor jet and pumps, vapor traps and valves along with other extensional piping’s.  A vessel that is operating under vacuum system may be any of these types such as processing tank, steam simulator, particle accelerator, or any other type of space that has an enclosed chamber to maintain the system in less than atmospheric gas pressure.  Since a [[vacuum]] is created in an enclosed chamber, the consideration of being able to withstand external [[atmospheric pressure]] are the usual precaution for this type of design.  Along with the effect of buckling or collapsing, the outer shell of vacuum chamber will be carefully evaluated and any sign of deterioration will be corrected by the increase of thickness of the shell itself.The main material used for vacuum design are usually mild steel, stainless steel, and aluminum.Other sections such as glass are used for gauge glass or view ports or sometimes electrical insulation. The interior of [[vacuum chamber]] should always be smooth and free of rush and defections.
High pressure solvent are usually used to remove any excess oil and contaminants that will affect vacuum in any way.Due to [[vacuum chamber]] is in an enclosed space, very specific detergents can be used to prevent any hazards or danger during cleaning. Any [[vacuum chamber]] should always have a certain number of access and viewing ports.  These are usually served as a flange connection to the attachment of pumps, piping or any other parts required for system operation.  The most importance is the fabrication of vacuum chambers sealing capability.The chamber itself must be airtight to maintain perfect vacuum, this is ensure through the process of leaking hunting generally using mass [[spectrometer]] leak detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vacuum Science and Engineering|last=Atta|first=C.M. Van|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1965|isbn=|location=New York|pages=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All openings and connections are also assembled with O rings and gaskets to prevent any further possible leakage of air in the system.

Vacuum engineering uses techniques and equipment that vary greatly depending on the level of vacuum used. Pressure slightly reduced from atmospheric pressure may be used to control airflow in ventilation systems, or in material handling systems. Lower-pressure vacuums may be used in vacuum evaporation in processing of food stuffs without excessive heating. Higher grades of vacuum are used for degassing, vacuum metallurgy, and in the production of light bulbs and cathode ray tubes. So-called "ultrahigh" vacuums are required for certain semiconductor processing; the "hardest" vacuums with the lowest pressure are produced for experiments in physics, where even a few stray atoms of air would interfere with the experiment in progress.

Apparatus used varies with decreasing pressure. Blowers give way to various kinds of reciprocating and rotary pumps. For some important applications, a [[steam ejector]] can quickly evacuate a large process vessel to a rough vacuum, sufficient for some processes or as a preliminary to more complete pumping processes. The invention of the [[Sprengel pump]] was a critical step in the development of the incandescent light bulb as it allowed creation of a vacuum that was higher than previously available, which extended the life of the bulbs. At higher vacuum levels (lower pressures), diffusion pumps, absorption, cyrogenic pumps are used. Pumps are more like "compressors" since they gather the rarefied gases in the vacuum vessel and push them into a much higher pressure, smaller volume, exhaust. A chain of two or more different kinds of vacuum pumps may be used in a vacuum system, with one "roughing" pump removing most of the mass of air from the system, and the additional stages handling relatively smaller amounts of air at lower and lower pressures. In some applications, a chemical element is used to combine with the air remaining in an enclosure after pumping. For example, in electronic [[vacuum tube]]s, a metallic "getter" was heated by induction to remove the air left after initial pump down and closure of the tubes. The "getter" would also slowly remove any gas evolved within the tube during its remaining life, maintaining sufficiently good vacuum.

==Applications==
Vacuum technology is a method used to evacuate air from a closed volume by creating a pressure differential from the closed volume to some vent, the ultimate vent being the open atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vacuum Technology|last=|first=|publisher=Hydraulics &amp; Pneumatics|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=83–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; When using an industrial vacuum system, a vacuum pump or generator creates this pressure differential. A variety of technical inventions were created based on the idea of vacuum discovered during the 17th century. These range from vacuum generation pumps to X-ray tubes, which were later introduced to the medical field for use as sources of [[X-ray | X-ray radiation]]. The vacuum environment has come to play an important role in scientific research as new discoveries are being made by looking back to the basic fundamentals of pressure. The idea of “perfect vacuum” cannot be realized, but very nearly approximated by the technological discoveries of the early 20th century. Vacuum engineering today uses a range of different material, from aluminum to zirconium and just about everything in between. There may be the popular belief that vacuum technology deals only with valves, flanges, and other vacuum components, but novel scientific discoveries are often made with the assistance of these traditional vacuum technologies, especially in the realm of high-tech. Vacuum engineering is used for [[List of semiconductor materials#Compound semiconductors|compound semiconductors]], power devices, memory logic, and [[photovoltaics]].

Another technical invention is the vacuum pump. Such invention is used to remove gas molecules from sealed volume thus leaving behind a partial vacuum. More than one vacuum pumps are used in a single application to create fluent flow. Fluent flow is used to allow a clear path made using vacuum to remove any air molecules in the way of the process. Vacuum will be used in this process to attempted to create a perfect vacuum. A type of vacuum such as partial vacuum can be caused by the usage of [[positive displacement pump|positive displacement]] type pumps. A positive displacement pump is able to transfer gas load from the entrance to the exit port, but due to its limitation of design it can only achieve a relatively low vacuum. In order to reach a higher vacuum, other techniques must be used. By using a series of pump such as following up a fast pump down with a positive displacement type pump will create a way better vacuum than using a single pump. These combination of pump used is usually determined by the need of vacuum in the system.

[[Materials for use in vacuum]] systems must be carefully evaluated. Many materials have a degree of porosity, unimportant at ordinary pressures, but which would continually admit minute amounts of air into a vacuum system if incorrectly used. Some items, such as rubber and plastic, [[outgassing|give off gases into a vacuum]] that can contaminate the system. At high and ultrahigh vacuum levels, even metals must be carefully selected - air molecules and moisture can cling to the surface of metals, and any trapped gas within the metal may percolate to the surface under vacuum. In some vacuum systems, a simple coating of low-volatile grease is sufficient to seal gaps in joints, but at ultrahigh vacuum, fittings must be carefully machined and polished to minimize trapped gas. It is usual practice to bake components of a high-vacuum system; at high temperatures, any gases or moisture adhering to the surface is driven off. However, this requirement affects which materials can be used.

[[Particle accelerator]]s are the largest ultrahigh vacuum systems and can be up to kilometres in length.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Jousten (ed),C. Benjamin Nakhosteen (transl.),  ''Handbook of Vacuum Technology'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2016 {{ISBN|3527688242}}, chapters 1, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The word “Vacuum” is originated from the Latin word “vacua”, which is translated to the word “empty”.Physicist use vacuum to describe a partially empty space, where air or some other  gases are being removed from one container. The idea of vacuum relating to the empty space has been speculated as early as 5th century from Greek philosophers, [[Aristotle]] (384-322 B.C.) was the one who came up with the relation of vacuum being an empty space in nature would be impossible to ever create.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7018/85d89b6a00275ba0cb627f54b5db326011f4.pdf .]&lt;/ref&gt; This idea had stuck around for over centuries until the 17th century, when vacuum technology and physics was discovered. In the mid 17th century, [[Evangelista Torricelli]] studied the properties of a vacuum generated by a mercury column in a glass tube; this became the [[barometer]], an instrument to observe variations in atmospheric air pressure.  [[Otto von Guericke]] spectacularly demonstrated the effect of atmospheric pressure in 1654, when teams of horses could not separate two 20-inch diameter hemispheres, which had been placed together and evacuated. In 1698, [[Thomas Savery]] patented a steam pump that relied on condensation of steam to produce a low-grade vacuum, for pumping water out of mines. The apparatus was improved in the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine]] of 1712; while inefficient, it allowed coal mines to be exploited that otherwise would flood by ground water. During the years of 1564-1642, the famous scientist [[Galileo]] was one of the first physicist to conduct experiments to develop measured forces to develop vacuum using a piston in a cylinder.This was a big discovery for scientist and was shared among others. French scientist and philosopher [[Blaise Pascal]] used the idea that was discovered to look into further research of vacuum. Pascal discoveries were similar to Torricelli’s research as Pascal used similar methods to pull vacuum using mercury. It was until the year 1661, when the mayor of the city of [[Magdeburg]] used this discovery to invent or retrofit new ideas. The mayor Otto von Guericke created the first air pump, modified the idea of water pumps, and also modified manometers.Vacuum engineering today, provides the solution for all thin film needs in the mechanical industry. This method of engineering is typically used for R&amp;D needs or large scale material production.

[[Atmospheric railway|Vacuum was used to propel trains]] experimentally.

Pump technology hit a plateau until [[Heinrich Geissler|Geissler]]  and [[Sprengel pump|Sprengle]] in the mid 19th century, who finally gave access to the high-vacuum regime. This led to the study of electrical discharges in vacuum, discovery of cathode rays,discovery of X-rays and the discovery of the electron. The photoelectric effect was observed in high vacuum, which was a key discovery that lead to the formulation of quantum mechanics and much of modern physics.
