'''Abuse of process''' is a cause of action in [[tort]] arising from one party making misusing or perversion of regularly issued court process (civil or criminal) not justified by the underlying legal action. It is a [[common law]] intentional tort. It is to be distinguished from [[malicious prosecution]], another type of tort that involves misuse of the public right of access to the [[court]]s.

The elements of a valid [[cause of action]] for abuse of process in most common law jurisdictions are as follows: (1) the existence of an ulterior purpose or motive underlying the use of process, and (2) some act in the use of the legal process not proper in the regular prosecution of the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''Cartwright v. Wexler, Wexler &amp; Heller, Ltd.'', 369 N.E.2d 185, 187 (Ill. App. Ct. 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Abuse of process can be distinguished from [[malicious prosecution]], in that abuse of process typically does not require proof of [[Malice (law)|malice]], lack of [[probable cause]] in procuring issuance of the process, or a termination favorable to the plaintiff, all of which are essential to a claim of malicious [[prosecution]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' ''Liquid Carbonic Acid Mfg. Co. v. Convert'', 82 Ill. App. 39, 44 (Ill. App. Ct. 1899).&lt;/ref&gt;   "Process," as used in this context, includes not only the "service of process," i.e. an official summons or other notice issued from a court, but means any method used to acquire jurisdiction over a person or specific property that is issued under the official seal of a court.&lt;ref&gt;''Arora v. Chui'', 664 N.E.2d 1101 (Ill. App. Ct. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the person who abuses process is interested only in accomplishing some improper purpose that is collateral to the proper object of the process and that offends justice, such as an unjustified arrest or an unfounded criminal prosecution. Subpoenas to testify, attachments of property, executions on property, garnishments, and other provisional remedies are among the types of "process" considered to be capable of abuse.

==Principle==
The principles which led to a finding of an abuse of process in the UK were stated in ''[[Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2000] UKHL 65; [2002] 2 AC 1, by [[Lord Bingham]] at 30-1.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Lord Bingham]].

{{cquote|"The underlying public interest is … that there should be finality in litigation and that a party should not be twice vexed in the same matter. This public interest is reinforced by the current emphasis on efficiency and economy in the conduct of litigation, in the interests of the parties and the public as a whole. The bringing of a claim or the raising of a defence in later proceedings may, without more, amount to abuse if the court is satisfied (the onus being on the party alleging abuse) that the claim or defence should have been raised in the earlier proceedings if it was to be raised at all. I would not accept that it is necessary, before abuse may be found, to identify any additional element such as a collateral attack on a previous decision or some dishonesty, but where those elements are present the later proceedings will be much more obviously abusive, and there will rarely be a finding of abuse unless the later proceeding involves what the court regards as unjust harassment of a party. It is, however, wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised in earlier proceedings it should have been, so as to render the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily abusive. That is to adopt too dogmatic an approach to what should in my opinion be a broad, merits-based judgment which takes account of the public and private interests involved and also takes account of all the facts of the case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before. As one cannot comprehensively list all possible forms of abuse, so one cannot formulate any hard and fast rule to determine whether, on given facts, abuse is to be found or not … Properly applied, and whatever the legitimacy of its descent, the rule has in my view a valuable part to play in protecting the interests of justice."}}

==Distinguished from malicious prosecution==

A cause of action for abuse of process is similar to the action for [[malicious prosecution]] in that both actions are based on and involve the improper use of the courts and legal systems.  The primary difference between the two legal actions is that malicious prosecution concerns the malicious or wrongful commencement of an action, while, on the other hand, abuse of process concerns the improper use of the legal process after process has already been issued and a suit has commenced.  In abuse of process, the legal process is misused for some purpose which is considered improper under the law.  Thus technically, the service of process itself—in the form of a summons—could be considered abuse of process under the right circumstances, e.g. fraudulent or malicious manipulation of the process itself,&lt;ref&gt;''Neurosurgery &amp; Spine Surgery, S.C. v. Goldman'' 339 Ill. App. 3d 177, 183 (Ill. App. Ct. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; but in malicious prosecution, the wrongful act is the actual filing of the suit itself for improper and malicious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;See also, http://trucounsel.com/index.php/abuse-of-process&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted above, the three requirements of malice, lack of probable cause in the issuance of the process, and a termination of the prior proceeding favorable to the plaintiff, are essential elements for malicious prosecution.  Most jurisdictions do not require any of these three elements in order to make out a prima facie case for abuse of process.

==Illustration==

A cause of action for abuse of process may lie in situations where a criminal proceeding is brought against a defendant for improper motives.  For example, in ''Lader v. Benkowitz'',&lt;ref&gt;66 N.Y.S.2d 713 (N.Y. Spec. Term 1946)&lt;/ref&gt; a pleading was held to state a good cause of action for abuse of process when it alleged that defendant hotel owner had threatened to have the plaintiff arrested on a warrant issued at the behest of the defendant on a charge of disorderly conduct.

The allegedly improper motive was the hotel owner's underlying purpose of compelling plaintiff to pay a bill owed for plaintiff's alleged rental of a room in defendant's hotel.  It was claimed that through the unlawful use of the warrant and threat of arrest, the defendant was able to obtain the sum of money allegedly owed by plaintiff. In denying defendant's motion to dismiss, the court admonished that it was sufficient to show that regularly issued process had been used to accomplish an improper purpose in order to set forth a cause of action for abuse of process.

The fact that the plaintiff had yielded to defendant's threat to have her arrested under the warrant did not diminish the cause of action, because it was clear that the plaintiff actually had been arrested for the purpose of compelling her to pay the cost of the room.

An '''active structure''' (also known as a '''smart''' or '''adaptive structure''') is a [[Mechanical system|mechanical]] structure with the ability to alter its configuration, form or properties in response to changes in the environment.{{fact|date=November 2016}}

The term active structure also refers to [[structure]]s that, unlike traditional [[engineering]] structures (e.g., bridges, buildings), require constant motion and hence power input to remain stable.{{fact|date=November 2016}} The advantage of active structures is that they can be far more massive than a traditional [[static structure]]: an example would be a [[space fountain]], a building that reaches into orbit.

==Function==
The result of the activity is a structure more suited for the type and magnitude of the load it is carrying. For example, an orientation change of a [[beam (structure)|beam]] could reduce the maximum stress or strain level, while a shape change could render a structure less susceptible to dynamic vibrations.{{fact|date=November 2016}} A good example of an adaptive structure is the human body where the [[skeleton]] carries a wide range of loads and the [[muscle]]s change its configuration to do so. Consider carrying a backpack. If the upper body did not adjust the [[centre of mass]] of the whole system slightly by leaning forward, the person would fall on his or her back.

An active structure consists of three integral components besides the load carrying part. They are the ''[[sensor]]s'', the ''[[Processor (computing)|processor]]'' and the ''[[actuator]]s''.{{fact|date=November 2016}} In the case of a [[human body]], the sensory nerves are the sensors which gather information of the environment. The brain acts as the processor to evaluate the information and decide to act accordingly and therefore instructs the muscles, which act as actuators to respond. In heavy engineering, there is already an emerging trend to incorporate activation into [[bridge]]s and [[dome]]s to minimize [[vibration]]s under wind and [[earthquake]] loads.

[[Aviation engineering]] and [[aerospace engineering]] have been the main driving force in developing modern active structures.{{fact|date=November 2016}} [[Aircraft]] (and [[spacecraft]]) require adaptation because they are exposed to many different environments, and therefore loadings, during their lifetime. Prior to launching they are subjected to gravity or dead loads, during
takeoff they are subjected to extreme dynamic and inertial loads and in-flight they need to be in a configuration which minimizes drag but promotes lift. A lot of effort has been committed into adaptive aircraft [[wing]]s to produce one that can control the separation of boundary layers and turbulence. Many space structures utilize adaptivity to survive extreme environmental challenges in space or to achieve precise accuracies. For example, space [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]]s and [[mirror]]s can be activated to precise orientation. As space technology advances, some sensitive equipment (namely [[interferometric]] optical and [[infrared]] astronomical instruments) are required to be accurate in position as delicate as a few [[nanometre]]s, while the supporting active structure is tens of metres in dimensions.

==Design==
Human-made actuators existing in the market, even the most sophisticated ones, are nearly all one-dimensional.{{fact|date=November 2016}} This means they are only capable of extending and contracting along, or rotating about 1 axis. Actuators capable of movement in both forward and reverse directions are known as two-way actuators, as opposed to one-way actuators which can only move in one direction. The limiting capability of actuators has restricted active structures to two main types: ''active truss structures'', based on linear actuators, and ''manipulator arms'', based on rotary
actuators.

A good active structure has a number of requirements. First, it needs to be easily actuated. The actuation should be energy-saving. A structure which is very stiff and strongly resists morphing is therefore not desirable. Second, the resulting structure must have structural integrity to carry the design loads. Therefore the process of actuation should not jeopardize the structure's strength. More precisely, we can say: We seek an active structure where actuation of some members will lead to a geometry change without substantially altering its stress state. In other words, a structure that has both [[statical determinacy]] and [[kinematic determinacy]] is optimal for actuation.{{fact|date=November 2016}}

==Applications==
Active-control technology is applied in civil engineering, mechanical engineering and aerospace engineering. Although most civil engineering structures are static, active control is utilized in some civil structures for deployment against seismic loading, wind loading and environmental vibration.&lt;ref name=korkmaz&gt;S. Korkmaz (2011). A review of active structural control: challenges for engineering informatics. ''Computers &amp; Structures''. {{doi|10.1016/j.compstruc.2011.07.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, active control is proposed to be used for damage tolerance purposes where human intervention is restricted.&lt;ref name=korkmaz2&gt;S. Korkmaz et al. (2011). Determining control strategies for damage tolerance of an active tensegrity structure. ''Engineering Structures'', 33:6, p. 1930-1939. {{doi|10.1016/j.engstruct.2011.02.031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korkmaz et al. demonstrated configuration of active control system for a damage tolerance and deployment of a bridge.&lt;ref name=korkmaz3&gt;S. Korkmaz et al. (2011). Configuration of control system for damage tolerance of a tensegrity bridge. ''Advanced Engineering Informatics''. {{doi|10.1016/j.aei.2011.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aestheticism''' (also the '''Aesthetic Movement''') is an intellectual and [[art movement]] supporting the emphasis of [[aesthetic]] values more than social-political themes for [[literature]], [[fine art]], [[music]] and other [[art]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul|last=Fargis|title=The New York Public Library Desk Reference - 3rd Edition|year=1998|publisher=Macmillan General Reference|pages=261|isbn=0-02-862169-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denney, Colleen. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RvTZrnmy5RoC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=%22Aesthetic+movement%22+swinburne&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fQGt-5H3y4&amp;sig=Ir3QCh29f7c926rkx620LbcB5fs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7kjKSuy9BNDdlAebobGSAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Aesthetic%20movement%22%20swinburne&amp;f=false "At the Temple of Art: the Grosvenor Gallery, 1877-1890"], Issue 1165, p. 38, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0-8386-3850-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This meant that art from this particular movement focused more on being beautiful rather than having a deeper meaning&amp;nbsp;— "art for art's sake". It was particularly prominent in Europe during the 19th century, supported by notable figures such as [[Walter Pater]] and [[Oscar Wilde]], but contemporary critics are also associated with the movement, such as [[Harold Bloom]], who has recently argued against projecting social and political ideology onto literary works, which he believes has been a growing problem in humanities departments over the 20th century. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In the 19th century, it was related to other movements such as [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] or [[Decadent movement|decadence]] represented in France, or [[decadentism]]o represented in Italy, and may be considered the British version of the same style.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Aesthetic literature==
The British decadent writers were much influenced by the [[Oxford]] professor [[Walter Pater]] and his essays published during 1867–68, in which he stated that life had to be lived intensely, with an ideal of beauty.  His text ''Studies in the History of the Renaissance'' (1873) was very well regarded by art-oriented young men of the late 19th century. Writers of the [[Decadent movement]] used the slogan "[[Art for Art's Sake]]" (''L'art pour l'art''), the origin of which is debated. Some claim that it was invented by the philosopher [[Victor Cousin]], although [[Angela Leighton]] in the publication ''On Form: Poetry, Aestheticism and the Legacy of a Word'' (2007) notes that the phrase was used by [[Benjamin Constant]] as early as 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Leighton (2007) 32.&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally accepted to have been promoted by [[Théophile Gautier]] in France, who interpreted the phrase to suggest that there was not any real association between art and [[morality]].

[[Image:Design for an Aesthetic theatrical poster.png|thumb|left|300px|One of many ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoons about æsthetes]]
The artists and writers of Aesthetic style tended to profess that the Arts should provide refined sensuous pleasure, rather than convey moral or sentimental messages. As a consequence, they did not accept [[John Ruskin]],  [[Matthew Arnold]], and [[George MacDonald]]'s conception of art as something moral or useful, "Art for truth's sake".&lt;ref&gt;Raeper, William (1987) George MacDonald, p. 183. Tring, Herts., and Batavia, IL: Lion Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they believed that Art did not have any [[didactic]] purpose; it only needed to be beautiful. The Aesthetes developed a cult of beauty, which they considered the basic factor of art. Life should copy Art, they asserted. They considered nature as crude and lacking in design when compared to art. The main characteristics of the style were: suggestion rather than statement, sensuality, great use of symbols, and [[Synesthesia|synaesthetic]]/[[ideasthesia|Ideasthetic]] effects—that is, correspondence between words, colours and music. Music was used to establish mood.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Predecessors of the Aesthetics included [[John Keats]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and some of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]]s who themselves were a legacy of the Romantic spirit. There are a few significant continuities between the Pre-Raphaelite philosophy and that of the Aesthetes: Dedication to the idea of ‘Art for Art’s Sake’; admiration of, and constant striving for, beauty; escapism through visual and literary arts; craftsmanship that is both careful and self-conscious; mutual interest in merging the arts of various media. This final idea is promoted in the poem ''L’Art'' by [[Théophile Gautier]], who compared the poet to the sculptor and painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to the Aesthetic Movement in English Literature|last=McMullen|first=Lorraine|publisher=Bytown Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=Ottawa, ON|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] are most strongly associated with Aestheticism. However, their approach to Aestheticism did not share the creed of ‘Art for Art’s Sake’ but rather “a spirited reassertion of those principles of colour, beauty, love, and cleanness that the drab, agitated, discouraging world of the mid-nineteenth century needed so much.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art|last=Welland|first=Dennis S. R.|publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd.|year=1953|isbn=|location=London, UK|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reassertion of beauty in a drab world also connects to Pre-Raphaelite escapism in art and poetry.

In Britain the best representatives were [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], both influenced by the French Symbolists, and [[James McNeill Whistler]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]. The style and these poets were satirised by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s comic opera ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' and other works, such as [[F. C. Burnand]]'s drama ''[[The Colonel (play)|The Colonel]]'', and in comic magazines such as ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]],'' particularly in works by George Du Maurier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=YgrdCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=michele%20mendelssohn&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Henry James, Oscar Wilde and Aesthetic Culture|last=Mendelssohn|first=Michèle|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0748623853|location=|pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compton Mackenzie]]'s novel ''[[Sinister Street]]'' makes use of the type as a phase through which the protagonist passes as he is influenced by older, decadent individuals. The novels of [[Evelyn Waugh]], who was a young participant of aesthete society at Oxford, describe the aesthetes mostly satirically, but also as a former participant. Some names associated with this assemblage are [[Robert Byron]], [[Evelyn Waugh]], [[Harold Acton]], [[Nancy Mitford]], [[A.E. Housman]] and [[Anthony Powell]].

==Aesthetic visual arts==

Artists associated with the Aesthetic style include Simeon Solomon, [[James McNeill Whistler]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], and [[Aubrey Vincent Beardsley|Aubrey Beardsley]]. Although the work of [[Edward Burne-Jones]] was exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] which promoted the movement, it also contains narrative and  conveys moral or sentimental messages hence it falls outside the given definition.

==Aesthetic Movement decorative arts==
[[File:Florian Papp Aesthetic Exhibition.jpg|thumb|Aesthetic Movement antiques at [[Florian Papp]], New York City]]
The primary element of Decorative Art is utility. The maxim "art for art's sake", identifying art or beauty as the primary element in other branches of the Aesthetic Movement, especially [[fine art]], cannot apply in this context. Decorative art must first have utility, but may also be beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Dresser]]. ''The Art of Decorative Design'' 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; Decorative art is dissociated from fine art.&lt;ref&gt;''The Illustrated London News'' LXXXI, Saturday, August 12, 1882, p.175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important elements of the Aesthetic Movement have been identified as Reform and Eastern Art.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Morley. ''Reform and Eastern Art'' Decorative Arts Society Journal, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Government Schools of Design were founded from 1837 onwards in order to improve the design of British goods. Following the Great Exhibition of 1851 efforts were intensified and Oriental objects purchased for the schools teaching collections. [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]], architect and Orientalist was requested to set out key principles of design and these became not only the basis of the schools teaching but also the propositions which preface ''The Grammar of Ornament'' (1856), which is still regarded as the finest systematic study or practical sourcebook of historic world ornament.

Jones identified the need for a new and modern style that would meet the requirements of the modern world, rather than the continual re-cycling of historic styles, but saw no reason to reject the lessons of the past. [[Christopher Dresser]], a student and later Professor at the school  worked with Owen Jones on ''The Grammar of Ornament'', as well as on the 1863 decoration of The Oriental Courts (Chinese, Japanese, and Indian) at the South Kensington Museum, advanced the search for a new style with his two publications ''The Art of Decorative Design'' 1862, and ''Principles of Design'' 1873.

Production of Aesthetic style furniture was limited to approximately the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Aesthetic style furniture is characterized by several common themes:
* [[Ebonized]] wood with gilt highlights.
* Far Eastern influence.
* Prominent use of nature, especially flowers, birds, ginkgo leaves, and peacock feathers.
* Blue and white on [[porcelain]] and other fine china.

Ebonized furniture means that the wood is painted or stained to a black ebony finish. The furniture is sometimes completely ebony-colored. More often however, there is gilding added to the carved surfaces of the feathers or stylized flowers that adorn the furniture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

As aesthetic movement decor was similar to the corresponding writing style in that it was about sensuality and nature, nature themes often appear on the furniture. A typical aesthetic feature is the gilded carved flower, or the stylized peacock feather. Colored paintings of birds or flowers are often seen. Non-ebonized aesthetic movement furniture may have realistic-looking three-dimensional-like renditions of birds or flowers carved into the wood.

Contrasting with the ebonized-gilt furniture is use of blue and white for porcelain and china. Similar themes of peacock feathers and nature would be used in blue and white tones on dinnerware and other crockery. The blue and white design was also popular on square porcelain tiles. It is reported that [[Oscar Wilde]] used aesthetic decorations during his youth. This aspect of the movement was also satirised by ''Punch'' magazine and in ''Patience''.

In 1882 Oscar Wilde visited Canada, where he toured the town of Woodstock, Ontario and gave a lecture on May 29 titled "The House Beautiful".&lt;ref&gt;O'brien (1982) 114.&lt;/ref&gt; This particular lecture featured the early Aesthetic art movement, also known as the "Ornamental Aesthetic" art style, where local flora and fauna were celebrated as beautiful and textured, layered ceilings were popular. An example of this can be seen in [[Annandale National Historic Site]], located in Tillsonburg, Ontario, Canada. The house was built in 1880 and decorated by Mary Ann Tillson, who happened to attend Oscar Wilde's lecture in Woodstock, and was influenced by it. Since the Aesthetic art movement was only prevalent from about 1880 until about 1890, there are not many surviving examples of this particular stylem but one such example is [[18 Stafford Terrace]], London, which provides an insight into how the middle classes interpreted the principles of Aesthetics.

'''''Alternity''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[role-playing game]] (RPG) published by [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] in [[1998 in games|1998]]. Following the acquisition of TSR by [[Wizards of the Coast]], the game was discontinued in 2000 as part of a broader rationalisation of TSR's business holdings, but it retains a small and devoted fanbase. Parts of ''Alternity'' as well as TSR's classic ''[[Star Frontiers]]'' game have been incorporated into the ''[[d20 Modern]]'' game, especially the ''[[d20 Future]]'' setting. The first campaign setting for the ''Alternity'' game, the ''Star*Drive'' setting, was introduced in 1998.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_History.asp| title=The History of TSR| publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]| accessdate=2005-08-20| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wizards.com%2Fdnd%2FDnDArchives_History.asp&amp;date=2008-10-04| archivedate=2008-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new game called ''Alternity'' is due in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sasquatchgamestudio.com/products/alternity/|title=Alternity – Sasquatch Game Studio|website=www.sasquatchgamestudio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==System==
Characters were created with a point-based system, and could be either humans, mutants, one of several alien species presented in the core books, or original aliens created by the GM. Classes were replaced by professions, which dictated what skills and abilities were cheaper for any given hero to get, though a few skills (in particular, [[psionics]]) were restricted to specific professions. 

Skills are classified into broad and speciality skills. Earning a specialty skill requires an associated broad skill, which requires a character to have sufficient associated ability points. Special skill is further classified into ranks, which affects the skill's scores. Skill scores are presented with the full score, half that score, and one-quarter that score. which represent the numbers needed to achieve Ordinary, Good, or Amazing successes in an action round respectively.

Unlike many other systems, actions are determined by a control die and situation
dice. When Gamemaster calls for a roll, player rolls 1 control die and 1 situation die. The control die is always a 20-sided die, while situation die can be a 0, 4, 6, 8, 12, 20-sided die, where 0-sided die means the action only depends on control die roll. Situation die can be plus die or a minus die, in which the value in the situation die is added to or subtracted from control die value. The total of the rolled numbers is checked against character's action, skill, feat, to indicate a success or a failure. Rolling low is always better for successfully completing an action. 

The type of situation die being used depends on the difficulty of the action. Difficulty is scaled in die types of -d20, -d12, -d8, -d6, -d4, +d0, +d4, +d6, +d8, +d12, +d20, +2d20, +3d20. A character's base situation die is +d4 for broad skill or feat check, +d0 for specialty skill or action check. A minus situation bonus means player uses a larger negative situation die set, while a plus situation penalty means a player uses a larger positive situation die set.

In an action round, a round is divided into 4 phases. Each phase relates to one of the degrees of success that are achievable on an action check: Amazing, Good, Ordinary, and Marginal, in order from the first phase to the last. A hero can attempt only 1 action per phase. Acting orders of characters are determined by a d20 die roll for all participants, which determines the earliest phase in which a character can act. All actions in a phase are considered to occur simultaneously, with the results of those actions being applied at the end of the phase. A character can act in as many phases as it has actions per round.

Depending on how far below the skill score the player rolled, there are 3 progressively better layers of success and 2 levels of failure. An action is determined using this same system, making the game very uniform. Only armor rolls and damage rolls did not use the d20.

Life points, called 'Durability', are categorized into Stun, Wound, Mortal. Stun damage can immobilize a character, but not life-threatening; wound damage can immobilize a character and inflicts 1 stun damage point for every 2 wound damage points received; mortal damage can kill a character, and inflicts 1 wound damage point for every 2 mortal damage points received. Durabilities can be repaired by healing, or:
*For Stun, ending a scene.
*For Wound, resting.
*For Mortal, use of the Medical Science–surgery skill.

Designed to be a generic rule set around which a campaign world could be built, it was not very heavily marketed and suffered from mediocre sales which, along with increased focus on the d20 system, led to the discontinuation of the game in 2000.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Much of the content of the ''Alternity'' game has been absorbed into the ''d20 Modern'' role-playing game. The ''Dark•Matter'' campaign is an entire ''d20 Modern'' expansion and ''Star Drive'' is part of the ''d20 Future'' expansion. The ''Gamma World'' campaign is an ''d20 Modern'' expansion by Sword &amp; Sorcery Studios (White Wolf).

===Dice mechanics===
''Alternity'' uses four, six, eight, twelve, and twenty-sided dice, but does not use the popular ten-sided die, perhaps to help distinguish it from the competing ''[[World of Darkness]]'' and the ''[[Trinity (role-playing game)|Trinity]]'' role-playing game, published by [[White Wolf Game Studio]].

The probability curve created by the addition or subtraction of a d20 and another die is shaped like a plateau, with two straight lines on both ends of the flat region. This is intermediate between the totally flat probability curve rolled by rolling a 20-sided die and the bell-shaped curve produced by die pool systems.

==Published products==
Several books were published under the ''Alternity'' banner as core products, accessories, or under specific campaign settings.

===Core products===
These products presented the basic rules and information about the ''Alternity'' system.
* '''Introductory Box Set''' – A box set including all the basic information for players and gamemasters to learn the ''Alternity'' rules.
* '''Player's Handbook''' – Included all the rules for players and player characters. Required to play.
* '''Gamemaster Guide''' – Included all the rules for gamemasters and session preparation. Required to play.
* '''Fast Play''' – An abbreviated form of the rules to ease players into the game.
* '''Campaign Kit''' – The kit included a [[gamemaster's screen]] and a booklet of record keeping forms.

===Accessories===
These products were not tied to any of the official campaign settings but could be used with them.
* '''Beyond Science: A Guide to FX''' – An exploration and reworking of the FX abilities (a sci-fi version of magic) in the corebook.
* '''Dataware''' – The guide to computers, hacking, and robotics.
* '''Mindwalking''' – The guide to psionics including revisions to the rules from the corebook.
* '''Starships''' – The guide to interstellar ships and travel.
* '''Tangents''' – This book explored the concept of parallel realities in the same vein as the 90s television show [[Sliders]].

===Campaign settings===
In addition to the general ''Alternity'' line of products, four campaign settings were published, each with their own books:
* ''[[Star*Drive]]'' – A space opera setting.
* ''[[Dark•Matter]]'' – A setting similar to [[The X-Files]] television show.
* ''[[Gamma World]]'' – An update to the classic post-apocalyptic [[Gamma World|game setting]].
* ''StarCraft Adventures'' – Based on the [[Starcraft|popular computer strategy game]] by [[Blizzard Entertainment]].  This setting used simplified "fast play" rules rather than the full ''Alternity'' rule set.&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A unit of [[real estate]] or [[immovable property]] is limited by a legal '''boundary''' (sometimes also referred to as a '''property line''' or a '''lot line'''). The boundary (in Latin: ''limes'') may appear as a discontinuation in the terrain: a ditch, a bank, a hedge, a wall, or similar, but essentially, a legal boundary is a conceptual entity, a [[social construct]], adjunct to the likewise abstract entity of [[property rights]].

A [[cadastral map]] displays how boundaries subdivide land into units of [[ownership]]. However, the relations between society, owner, and land in any culture or [[jurisdiction]] is conceived of in terms more complex than a [[tessellation]]. Therefore, the society concerned has to specify the rules and means by which the boundary concept is materialized and located on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Turk, Andrew (2007) Representations of Tribal Boundaries of Australian Indigenous Peoples and the Implications for Geographic Information Systems. pp 232 - 244 in Dyson, ''et al'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 'Western' version of the [[operationalization]] might be a legally specified procedure, performed by a [[Chartered Surveyor|chartered surveyor]], supported by statements from neighbors and pertinent documents, and resulting in official recording in the [[cadastre]] as well as boundary markings in the field. Alternatively, indigenous people represent boundaries through ephemeral performances, such as [[Songlines|song]] and dance, and, when in more permanent form, e.g. paintings or carvings, in artistic or metaphorical manner.&lt;ref&gt;Muecke, S., Benterrak, K., &amp; Roe P. (1984) Reading the country: An introduction to nomadology. Fremantle, W.A.: Fremantle Arts Centre Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

It declares that the public may utilize the space inside the private property by a revocable license, to prevent it to become a [[prescriptive easement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jordan|first1=Cora|last2=Randolph|first2=Mary|title=Neighbor law : fences, trees, boundaries, and noise|date=1994|publisher=Nolo Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780873372664|edition=2nd|url=http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/forestry/easement/easementsacquiredbyuseofproperty.pdf|accessdate=26 July 2014|chapter=Easements Acquired by Use of Property|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318213516/http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/forestry/easement/easementsacquiredbyuseofproperty.pdf#|archive-date=2015-03-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Legal boundaries are usually established by a professional [[surveying|surveyor]] using a [[theodolite|transit]] and or modern [[Global Positioning System|Global Positioning System (GPS)]] technology. The coordinates of the property line are often described on a drawing called a "plot plan" or "[[plat]]" by indicating the length of the boundary along a specific compass bearing in relation to a verifiable "point of beginning". The [[metes and bounds]] method is also used to provide a legal description of a property.

On maps, the line may be marked with {{unichar|214a|PROPERTY LINE|size=200%|html=}}.

The &amp;#8522; symbol may also be used in architectural drawings and CAD design to show plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Text Symbols and Special Characters Reference|url=https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/AutoCAD-Core/files/GUID-518E1A9D-398C-4A8A-AC32-2D85590CDBE1-htm.html|website=AutoDesk Knowledge Network|publisher=AutoDesk AutoCAD|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''causal adequacy principle''' ('''CAP''') is a philosophical claim made by [[René Descartes]] that  the cause of an object must contain at least as much reality as the object itself, whether formally or eminently.

==Overview==
Descartes defends CAP by quoting Roman philosopher [[Lucretius]]:
"Ex nihilo nihil fit", meaning "[[Nothing comes from nothing]]". —&lt;small&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Carus
  | first = Lucretius
  | authorlink = Lucretius
  | title = De Rerum Natura
  | publisher = Oxford University Press
  | date = 1947
  | pages = 146–482 }}&lt;/small&gt;

In his meditations, Descartes uses the CAP to support his [[trademark argument]] for the existence of God. Descartes' assertions were disputed by [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his "Third Set of Objections" published in 1641. 

René Descartes was ''not'' the founder of this philosophical claim. It is used in the classical metaphysics of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], and features eminently in the works of [[Thomas Aquinas]].

==Details==
*A "cause" is that which brings something into effect.
*If an item has the quality X formally, it has it in the literal or strict sense.
*If an item has the quality X eminently, it has it in a higher or grander form.

To demonstrate this, a person can possess money formally by holding it on their person, or by storing it in a bank account. Similarly, a person can eminently possess money by owning assets that could readily be exchanged for it.

Descartes offers two explanations of his own:

*Heat cannot be produced in an object which was not previously hot, except by something of at least the same order of perfection as heat.
*A stone, for example, which previously did not exist, cannot begin to exist unless it is produced by something which contains, either formally or eminently everything to be found in the stone.

Descartes goes on to claim that the CAP not only applies to stones, but also the realm of ideas, and the features that are seen as part of the objective reality of an idea.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1975">'''Communication access real-time translation (CART)''', also called '''open captioning''' or '''real-time stenography''', or simply real-time captioning, is the general name of the system that [[court reporters]], [[closed captioning|closed captioners]] and voice writers, and others use to convert speech to text.  A trained operator uses keyboard or [[stenography]] methods to transcribe spoken speech into written text. Speech to text software is used when voice writers provide CART.

While real-time speech-to-text serves many with hearing loss and deafness, it is also useful for people whose first language is different from the language being used, to understand speakers with different voices and accents in many group situations (at work, in education, community events), to have a "transcript', and for learning languages. CART professionals have qualifications for added expertise (speed and accuracy) as compared to court reporters and other stenographers. 

'''Remote CART''' is done with the trained operator at a remote location.  A voice connection such as a telephone, cellphone, or computer microphone is used to send the voice to the operator, and the [[real-time text]] is transmitted back over a modem, Internet, or other data connection.

Some people use CART as the short form of computer assisted realtime transcription.  The service is identical.

In some countries, CART may be referred to as Palantype, Velotype, STTR (speech to text reporting).

In [[cognitive psychology]] and [[decision science]], '''conservatism''' or '''conservatism bias''' is a [[cognitive bias|bias]] in human information processing, which refers to the tendency to revise one's belief insufficiently when presented with new evidence. This bias describes human [[belief revision]] in which persons over-weigh the [[prior distribution]] ([[base rate]]) and under-weigh new [[statistical sample|sample evidence]] when compared to Bayesian belief-revision.

According to the theory, "opinion change is very orderly, and usually proportional to the numbers of [[Bayes' theorem]] – but it is insufficient in amount".&lt;ref name="edwards1"/&gt; In other words, persons update their prior beliefs as new evidence becomes available, but they do so more slowly than they would if they used Bayes' theorem.

This bias was discussed by [[Ward Edwards]] in 1968,&lt;ref name="edwards1"/&gt; who reported on experiments like the following one:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are two bookbags, one containing 700 red and 300 blue chips, the other containing 300 red and 700 blue. Take one of the bags. Now, you sample, randomly, with replacement after each chip. In 12 samples, you get 8 reds and 4 blues. what is the probability that this is the predominantly red bag?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most subjects chose an answer around .7. The correct answer according to Bayes' theorem is closer to .97. Edwards suggested that people updated beliefs conservatively, in accordance with Bayes' theorem more slowly. They updated from .5 incorrectly according to an observed bias in several experiments.&lt;ref name="edwards1"/&gt;

==In finance==

In finance, evidence has been found that investors under-react to corporate events, consistent with conservatism. This includes announcements of earnings, changes in [[dividend]]s, and [[stock split]]s.&lt;ref name=Kadiyala/&gt;

==Possible explanations==
The traditional explanation for this effect is that it is an extension of the [[anchoring bias]], as studied by Tversky and Kahneman. The initial "anchor" is the .5 probability given when there are two choices without any other evidence, and people fail to adjust sufficiently far away. However, a recent study suggests that the belief revising conservatism can be explained by an [[information-theoretic]] generative mechanism and that assumes a noisy conversion of objective evidence (observation) into subjective estimates (judgment).&lt;ref name="HilbertPsychBull"/&gt; The study explains that the estimates of conditional probabilities are conservative because of noise in the retrieval of information from memory, whereas noise is defined as the mixing of evidence. Memories of high likelihoods are mixed with evidence of low likelihood and the resulting estimate is lower than it should be. The retrieval of memories of lower likelihoods are higher than they should be, and the result is conservatism (low is not low enough, and high is not high enough, the result is not extreme enough, which is conservative).

In an incentivized experimental study, it has been shown that the conservatism bias decreased in those with greater cognitive ability, though it did not disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cognitive abilities and behavioral biases|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268109001103|journal = Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|date = 2009|pages = 147–152|volume = 72|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.jebo.2009.04.018|first = Jörg|last = Oechssler|first2 = Andreas|last2 = Roider|first3 = Patrick W.|last3 = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1421 Sensory Homunculus.jpg|thumb|right|400px|A [[2D geometric model|2-D]] cortical ''sensory'' homunculus]]

A '''cortical homunculus''' is a distorted representation of the human body, based on a neurological "map" of the areas and proportions of the [[human brain]] dedicated to processing motor functions, or sensory functions, for different parts of the body.  The word ''[[homunculus]]'' is [[Latin]] for "little man", and was a term used in [[alchemy]] and [[folklore]] long before scientific literature began using it. A cortical homunculus, or "cortex man", illustrates the concept of [[heuristic]]ally representing the body lying within the brain. [[Nerve]] fibres from the [[spinal cord]] terminate in various areas of the [[parietal lobe]] in the [[cerebral cortex]], which forms a representational map of the body.

== Types ==
[[File:Motor homunculus.svg|thumb|A 2-D cortical ''motor'' homunculus]]

A ''motor'' homunculus represents a map of brain areas dedicated to ''motor'' processing for different anatomical divisions of the body.  The [[primary motor cortex]] is located in the [[precentral gyrus]], and handles signals coming from the premotor area of the [[frontal lobe]]s.&lt;ref name="Human Anatomy and Physiology"&gt;Marieb, E., Hoehn, K. ''Human Anatomy and Physiology''. 7th Ed. 2007. Pearson Benjamin Cummings: San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''sensory'' homunculus represents a map of brain areas dedicated to ''sensory'' processing for different anatomical divisions of the body.  The [[postcentral gyrus|primary sensory cortex]] is located in the [[postcentral gyrus]], and handles signals coming from the [[thalamus]].&lt;ref name="Human Anatomy and Physiology" /&gt;

These signals are transmitted on from the gyri to the [[brain stem]] and [[spinal cord]] via corresponding nerves.

== Arrangement ==
Along the length of the primary motor and sensory cortices, the areas specializing in different parts of the body are arranged in an orderly manner, although ordered differently than one might expect.  The toes are represented at the top of the cerebral hemisphere (or more accurately, "the upper end", since the cortex curls inwards and down at the top), and then as one moves down the hemisphere, progressively higher parts of the body are represented, assuming a body that's faceless and has arms raised.  Going further down the cortex, the different areas of the face are represented, in approximately top-to-bottom order, rather than bottom-to-top as before.  The homunculus is split in half, with motor and sensory representations for the left side of the body on the right side of the brain, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Saladin, Kenneth (2007). Anatomy and Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function. McGraw Hill. p. 544-546&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of cortex devoted to any given body region is not proportional to that body region's surface area or volume, but rather to how richly innervated that region is.  Areas of the body with more complex and/or more numerous sensory or motor connections are represented as larger in the homunculus, while those with less complex and/or less numerous connections are represented as smaller.  The resulting image is that of a distorted human body, with disproportionately huge hands, lips, and face.

In the sensory homunculus, below the areas handling sensation for the teeth, gums, jaw, tongue, and pharynx lies an area for intra-abdominal sensation.  At the very top end of the primary sensory cortex, beyond the area for the toes, it has traditionally been believed that the sensory neural networks for the genitals occur.  However, more recent research has suggested that there may be two different cortical areas for the genitals, possibly differentiated by one dealing with [[sexual stimulation|erogenous stimulation]] and the other dealing with non-erogenous stimulation.&lt;ref name=willcov&gt;{{cite web |url=http://willcov.com/bio-consciousness/diagrams/Homunculus%20(Topographic)%20Diagram.htm |title=Homunculus (Topographic) Diagram |website=willcov.com |last=Covington, Jr. |first=William Oates |date=2015-05-27 |access-date=2017-07-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703025727/http://willcov.com/bio-consciousness/diagrams/Homunculus%20(Topographic)%20Diagram.htm |archivedate=2017-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=neurocritic&gt;{{cite web |url=https://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2009/08/new-clitoral-homunculus.html |title=The Neurocritic: A New Clitoral Homunculus? |date=2009-08-10 |access-date=2017-07-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707211146/http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2009/08/new-clitoral-homunculus.html |archivedate=2017-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=review&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cazala |first=Fadwa |last2=Vienney |first2=Nicolas |last3=Stoléru |first3=Serge |title=The cortical sensory representation of genitalia in women and men: a systematic review |journal=Socioaffective Neuroscience &amp; Psychology |volume=5 |doi=10.3402/snp.v5.26428 |issn=2000-9011 |pmc=4357265 |pmid=25766001 |date=2015-03-10 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
[[File:Sensory and motor homunculi.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|3-D Sensory and Motor homunculus models at the [[Natural History Museum, London]]]]

Dr. [[Wilder Penfield]] and his co-investigators Edwin Boldrey and Theodore Rasmussen are considered to be the originators of the sensory and motor homunculi.  They were not the first scientists to attempt to objectify human brain function by means of a homunculus.&lt;ref name=review /&gt;  However, they were the first to differentiate between sensory and motor function and to map the two across the brain separately, resulting in two different homunculi.  In addition, their drawings and later drawings derived from theirs became perhaps the most famous conceptual maps in modern neuroscience because they compellingly illustrated the data at a single glance.&lt;ref name=review /&gt;

Penfield first conceived of his homunculi as a thought experiment, and went so far as to envision an imaginary world in which the homunculi lived, which he referred to as "if".  He and his colleagues went on to experiment with electrical stimulation of different brain areas of patients undergoing open brain surgery to control epilepsy, and were thus able to produce the topographical brain maps and their corresponding homunculi.&lt;ref name=review /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Penfield |first1=Wilder |last2=Boldrey |first2=Edwin |title=Somatic Motor And Sensory Representation In The Cerebral Cortex Of Man As Studied By Electrical Stimulation |journal=Brain |date=1937 |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=389–443 |doi=10.1093/brain/60.4.389 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/60/4/389 |accessdate=26 March 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208192147/http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/60/4/389 |archivedate=8 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent studies have improved this understanding of [[somatotopic arrangement]] using techniques such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI).&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Grodd|Grodd W]], Hülsmann E, Lotze M, Wildgruber D, Erb M. Sensorimotor mapping of the human cerebellum: fMRI evidence of somatotopic organization. Hum Brain Mapp. 2001 Jun;13(2):55-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Representation ==
Penfield referred to his creations as "grotesque creatures" due to their strange-looking proportions.  For example, the sensory nerves arriving from the hands terminate over large areas of the brain, resulting in the hands of the homunculus being correspondingly large.  In contrast, the nerves emanating from the torso or arms cover a much smaller area, thus the torso and arms of the homunculus look comparatively small and weak.

Penfield's homunculi are usually shown as 2-D diagrams.  This is an oversimplification, as it cannot fully show the data set Penfield collected from his brain surgery patients.  Rather than the sharp delineation between different body areas shown in the drawings, there is actually significant overlap between neighboring regions.  The simplification suggests that lesions of the motor cortex will give rise to specific deficits in specific muscles.  However, [[Primary motor cortex#Common misconceptions|this is a misconception]], as lesions produce deficits in groups of synergistic muscles.  This finding suggests that the [[Primary motor cortex|motor cortex]] functions in terms of overall movements as coordinated groups of individual motions.

The sensorimotor homunculi can also be represented as 3-D figures (such as the sensory homunculus sculpted by Sharon Price-James shown from different angles below), which can make it easier for laymen to understand the ratios between the different body regions' levels of motor or sensory innervation.  However, these 3-D models do not illustrate which areas of the brain are associated with which parts of the body.

'''Critical Metrics''' was a web-based [[Recommender system|music recommendation service]]. Unlike user-driven sites like [[The Hype Machine]] and [[Pandora (music service)|Pandora]], Critical Metrics featured only expert-generated content. Aggregating reviews and playlists from over 150 publications, both print and online, the site also encompassed historical sources. The site then ranked the songs mathematically, based on the information gathered. With a methodology based in the fields of [[bibliometrics]] and [[sentiment analysis]], Critical Metrics quantified these positive citations and sentiments into indices for media playlisting and consumption.

Streaming audio and [[YouTube]] videos were presented with the original recommendations, along with the option to purchase via [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] or other online retailers. When the site was launched in April 2007, it hosted the streaming music itself. A licensing arrangement with [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]] removed the free music, but allowed unlimited listening and playlist-building for Rhapsody subscribers.

Critical Metrics was founded by Joey Anuff, the co-founder of [[Suck.com]] and a former [[VH1]] executive. The site was praised by [[Boing Boing]], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and ''[[Business Week]]''. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' senior music critic [[Ann Powers]] referred to the site as her "favorite snobby top 40 station".

The '''''Dashboard of Sustainability''''' is a free-of-charge, non-commercial software package configured to convey the complex relationships among economic, social, and environmental issues.
The software is designed to help developing countries achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]] and work towards [[sustainable development]]. The software package was developed by members of the Consultative Group on Sustainable Development Indicators (CGSDI),&lt;ref&gt;Consultative Group on Sustainable Development Indicators.  (2006)  ''[http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/dashboard.asp Dashboard of Sustainability.]''; see also ''[http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/history.asp CGSDI history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106123832/http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/history.asp |date=2007-01-06 }}'' and ''[http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/members.asp CGSDI members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224102435/http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/members.asp |date=2007-02-24 }}'', all obtained Apr. 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been applied to quite a number of indicator sets, inter alia to the Millennium Development Goals indicators and the United Nations [[Commission on Sustainable Development]] indicators.

In 2002, Dashboard of Sustainability researchers Jochen Jesinghaus and Peter Hardi presented the Dashboard of Sustainability at the [[Earth Summit 2002|Johannesburg Summit]]&lt;ref&gt;IISD Earth Negotiations Bulletin (ENB) ''[http://www.iisd.ca/2002/wssd/enbots/aug30.html ENB on the side, Aug. 30, 2002]'' obtained Apr. 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2002 [[World Social Forum]] in [[Porto Alegre]].&lt;ref&gt;Ranjit Devraj (TerraViva), ''[http://ipsnews.net/terraviva/05_dashboard.shtml Internet Dashboard Device for Navigating Development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411090712/http://www.ipsnews.net/terraviva/05_dashboard.shtml |date=2007-04-11 }}'', obtained Apr. 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It was also included in the resources for the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] World Forum on Key Indicators.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2004), ''[http://www.oecd.org/document/2/0,2340,en_21571361_31834434_33637186_1_1_1_1,00.html European Union 2002, Dashboard of Sustainability]'', obtained Apr. 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, the Millennium Project utilized the Dashboard of Sustainability to conclude in their [[State of the Future]] report that global prospects for improving the overall health, wealth, and sustainability of humanity are improving, but slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, Jerome C.; Gordon, Theodore J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10084">In [[mathematics]] and in particular [[Dynamical system|mathematical dynamics]], '''discrete time''' and '''continuous time''' are two alternative frameworks within which to model [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] that evolve over time.

==Discrete time==
[[Image:Sampled.signal.svg|right|thumb|Discrete sampled signal]]

'''Discrete time''' views values of variables as occurring at distinct, separate "points in time", or equivalently as being unchanged throughout each non-zero region of time ("time period")&amp;mdash;that is, time is viewed as a [[discrete variable]]. Thus a non-time variable jumps from one value to another as time moves from one time period to the next. This view of time corresponds to a digital clock that gives a fixed reading of 10:37 for a while, and then jumps to a new fixed reading of 10:38, etc. In this framework, each variable of interest is measured once at each time period. The number of measurements between any two time periods is finite. Measurements are typically made at sequential [[integer]] values of the variable "time".

A '''discrete signal''' or '''discrete-time signal''' is a [[time series]] consisting of a [[sequence]] of quantities.

Unlike a continuous-time signal, a discrete-time signal is not a function of a continuous argument; however, it may have been obtained by [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] from a continuous-time signal. When a discrete-time signal is obtained by sampling a sequence at uniformly spaced times, it has an associated [[sampling rate]].

Discrete-time signals may have several origins, but can usually be classified into one of two groups:&lt;ref&gt;"Digital Signal Processing" Prentice Hall - Pages 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

* By acquiring values of an [[analog signal]] at constant or variable rate. This process is called [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]].&lt;ref&gt;"Digital Signal Processing: Instant access." Butterworth-Heinemann - Page 8&lt;/ref&gt;
* By observing an inherently discrete-time process, such as the weekly peak value of a particular economic indicator.

==Continuous time==

In contrast, '''continuous time''' views variables as having a particular value for potentially only an [[infinitesimal]]ly short amount of time. Between any two points in time there are an [[infinity|infinite]] number of other points in time. The variable "time" ranges over the entire [[real number line]], or depending on the context, over some subset of it such as the non-negative reals. Thus time is viewed as a [[continuous variable]].

A '''continuous signal''' or a '''continuous-time signal''' is a varying [[quantity]] (a [[signal (information theory)|signal]]) 
whose domain, which is often time, is a [[Continuum (set theory)|continuum]] (e.g., a [[connected space|connected]] interval of the [[real number|reals]]). That is, the function's domain is an [[uncountable set]]. The function itself need not be [[continuous function|continuous]]. To contrast, a [[discrete time]] signal has a [[countable set|countable]] domain, like the [[natural number]]s.

A signal of continuous amplitude and time is known as a continuous-time signal or an [[analog signal]]. This (a [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]]) will have some value at every instant of time. The electrical signals derived in proportion with the physical quantities such as temperature, pressure, sound etc. are generally continuous signals. Other examples of continuous signals are sine wave, cosine wave, triangular wave etc. 

The signal is defined over a domain, which may or may not be finite, and there is a functional mapping from the domain to the value of the signal. The continuity of the time variable, in connection with the law of density of [[real numbers]], means that the signal value can be found at any arbitrary point in time.

A typical example of an infinite duration signal is:

&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \sin(t), \quad t \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

A finite duration counterpart of the above signal could be:

&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \sin(t), \quad t \in [-\pi,\pi]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(t) = 0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise.

The value of a finite (or infinite) duration signal may or may not be finite. For example,

&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \frac{1}{t}, \quad t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(t) = 0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise,

is a finite duration signal but it takes an infinite value for &lt;math&gt;t = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;. 

In many disciplines, the convention is that a continuous signal must always have a finite value, which makes more sense in the case of physical signals.

For some purposes, infinite singularities are acceptable as long as the signal is integrable over any finite interval (for example, the &lt;math&gt;t^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; signal is not integrable at infinity, but &lt;math&gt;t^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; is).

Any analog signal is continuous by nature. [[Discrete-time signal]]s, used in [[digital signal processing]], can be obtained by [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] and [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] of continuous signals.

Continuous signal may also be defined over an independent variable other than time. Another very common independent variable is space and is particularly useful in [[image processing]], where two  space dimensions are used.

==Relevant contexts==

Discrete time is often employed when [[empirical]] [[measurement]]s are involved, because normally it is only possible to measure variables sequentially. For example, while [[economic activity]] actually occurs continuously, there being no moment when the economy is totally in a pause, it is only possible to measure economic activity discretely. For this reason, published data on, for example, [[gross domestic product]] will show a sequence of [[Calendar year#Quarters|quarterly]] values.

When one attempts to empirically explain such variables in terms of other variables and/or their own prior values, one uses [[time series]] or [[regression analysis|regression]] methods in which variables are indexed with a subscript indicating the time period in which the observation occurred. For example, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; might refer to the value of [[income]] observed in unspecified time period ''t'', ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt; to the value of income observed in the third time period, etc.

Moreover, when a researcher attempts to develop a theory to explain what is observed in discrete time, often the theory itself is expressed in discrete time in order to facilitate the development of a time series or regression model.

On the other hand, it is often more mathematically [[Closed form solution|tractable]] to construct [[Scientific theory|theoretical model]]s in continuous time, and often in areas such as [[physics]] an exact description requires the use of continuous time. In a continuous time context, the value of a variable ''y'' at an unspecified point in time is denoted as ''y''(''t'') or, when the meaning is clear, simply as ''y''.

==Types of equations==

===Discrete time===

Discrete time makes use of [[difference equation]]s, also known as recurrence relations. An example, known as the [[logistic map]] or logistic equation, is

:&lt;math&gt; x_{t+1} = rx_t(1-x_t),&lt;/math&gt;

in which ''r'' is a [[Parameter#Mathematical functions|parameter]] in the range from 2 to 4 inclusive, and ''x'' is a variable in the range from 0 to 1 inclusive whose value in period ''t'' [[nonlinearity|nonlinearly]] affects its value in the next period, ''t''+1. For example, if &lt;math&gt;r=4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_1 = 1/3&lt;/math&gt;, then for ''t''=1 we have &lt;math&gt;x_2=4(1/3)(2/3)=8/9&lt;/math&gt;, and for ''t''=2 we have &lt;math&gt;x_3=4(8/9)(1/9)=32/81&lt;/math&gt;.

Another example models the adjustment of a [[price]] ''P'' in response to non-zero [[excess demand]] for a product as

:&lt;math&gt;P_{t+1} = P_t + \delta \cdot f(P_t,...)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the positive speed-of-adjustment parameter which is less than or equal to 1, and where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[excess demand function]].

===Continuous time===

Continuous time makes use of [[differential equation]]s. For example, the adjustment of a price ''P'' in response to non-zero excess demand for a product can be modeled in continuous time as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt}=\lambda \cdot f(P,...)&lt;/math&gt;

where the left side is the [[first derivative]] of the price with respect to time (that is, the rate of change of the price), &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the speed-of-adjustment parameter which can be any positive finite number, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is again the excess demand function.

==Graphical depiction==

A variable measured in discrete time can be plotted as a [[step function]], in which each time period is given a region on the [[horizontal axis]] of the same length as every other time period, and the measured variable is plotted as a height that stays constant throughout the region of the time period. In this graphical technique, the graph appears as a sequence of horizontal steps. Alternatively, each time period can be viewed as a detached point in time, usually at an integer value on the horizontal axis, and the measured variable is plotted as a height above that time-axis point. In this technique, the graph appears as a set of dots.

The values of a variable measured in continuous time are plotted as a [[continuous function]], since the domain of time is considered to be the entire real axis or at least some connected portion of it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1148">The '''displacement–length ratio''' ('''DLR''' or '''D/L ratio''') is a calculation used to express how heavy a [[boat]] is relative to its [[waterline]] length. ([[John_Rousmaniere|Rousmaniere]], 1999)

A DLR is calculated by dividing a boat's [[displacement (fluid)|displacement]] in [[long ton]]s (2,240 pounds) by the cube of one one-hundredth of the waterline length (in feet):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{DLR} = \frac{\mathit{displacement}(\mathrm{lb}) ~/~ 2240} {(0.01 \times \mathit{LWL}(\mathrm{ft}))^3}.&lt;/math&gt;

The DLR can be used to compare the relative mass of various boats no matter what their length. A DLR less than 200 is indicative of a racing boat, while a DLR greater than 300 or so is indicative of a heavy cruising boat.

In [[mathematics]], the '''fixed-point index''' is a concept in [[topological]] [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed-point]] theory, and in particular [[Nielsen theory]]. The fixed-point index can be thought of as a [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] measurement for fixed points.

The index can be easily defined in the setting of [[complex analysis]]: Let ''f''(''z'') be a [[holomorphic map]]ping on the complex plane, and let ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be a fixed point of ''f''. Then the function ''f''(''z'')&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''z'' is holomorphic, and has an isolated zero at ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. We define the fixed point index of ''f'' at ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, denoted ''i''(''f'', ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), to be the multiplicity of the zero of the function ''f''(''z'')&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''z'' at the point ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

In real Euclidean space, the fixed-point index is defined as follows: If ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is an isolated fixed point of ''f'', then let ''g'' be the function defined by

:&lt;math&gt;g(x) = \frac{x - f(x)}{|| x - f(x) ||}. &lt;/math&gt;

Then ''g'' has an isolated singularity at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and maps the boundary of some deleted neighborhood of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to the unit sphere. We define ''i''(''f'',&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) to be the [[L. E. J. Brouwer|Brouwer]] [[Degree of a continuous mapping|degree]] of the mapping induced by ''g'' on some suitably chosen small sphere around ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;A. Katok and B. Hasselblatt(1995), Introduction to the modern theory of dynamical systems, Cambridge University Press, Chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Lefschetz–Hopf theorem==
The importance of the fixed-point index is largely due to its role in the [[Solomon Lefschetz|Lefschetz]]–[[Heinz Hopf|Hopf]] theorem, which states:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{x \in \mathrm{Fix}(f)} i(f,x) = \Lambda_f,&lt;/math&gt;

where Fix(''f'') is the set of fixed points of ''f'', and ''Λ''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Lefschetz number]] of ''f''.

Since the quantity on the left-hand side of the above is clearly zero when ''f'' has no fixed points, the Lefschetz–Hopf theorem trivially implies the [[Lefschetz fixed point theorem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20935">'''Happy slapping''' was a [[Fads and trends|fad]] originating in the [[United Kingdom]] around 2005, in which one or more people out of [[boredom]] attack a victim for the purpose of recording the assault (commonly with a [[camera phone]] or a [[smartphone]]). Though the term usually refers to relatively minor acts of violence such as hitting or slapping the victim, more serious crimes such as the [[manslaughter]] of a pensioner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10331547|title='Happy slapping' gang members admit killing Ekram Haque|work=[[BBC News]]|date=16 June 2010|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sexual assault]] have been classified as "happy slapping" by the [[BBC]].&lt;ref name=sexattack&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6970516.stm|title=Sex attack phone girls detained|work=BBC News|date=30 August 2007|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use with video technology==
The ease and general availability of video cameras in mobile phones means that such attacks need not be planned carefully beforehand and are more easily watched and circulated for entertainment. Some political and media commentators claim the craze was inspired by such television shows as ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'', ''[[Dirty Sanchez (TV series)|Dirty Sanchez]]'' and ''[[Bumfights]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/tv-to-blame-for-happy-slapping-craze-1069006|title=TV to blame for 'happy slapping' craze |date=30 June 2005|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4539861.stm|title='Don't ban' slap attack TV shows|work=BBC News|date=12 May 2005|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=1972548|title='Happy Slapping' Spreads in London|first=Nick|last=Watt|date=17 May 2006|work=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
"Happy slapping" started in the [[South London]] [[London Borough of Lewisham|Borough of Lewisham]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4539913.stm|title=Does 'happy slapping' exist?|last=Akwagyiram|first=Alexis|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1620568,00.html|title=Happy-slap link to TV shows |last=Johnston|first=Chris|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=1 September 2016|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a format known as "Slap Happy TV", where a happy-slapping video would be recorded, and then watched by dozens of people like a TV show, but in the form of a montage. Videos of Happy Slapping were commonly circulated via Bluetooth on mobile phones. The first newspaper article to use the phrase "happy slapping" was "Bullies film fights by phone", published in The ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]'' on 21 January 2005, in which reporter Michael Shaw described teachers' accounts of the craze in London schools.

Gary Martin, writing on "The Phrase Finder" website described the phenomenon as: "Unprovoked attacks on individuals made in order to record the event, and especially the victim's shock and surprise, on video phones."&lt;ref name=phrases&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/170890.html|title=Happy slapping|first=Gary|last=Martin|work=phrases.org.uk|accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin wrote that happy slapping "began as a youth craze in the UK in late 2004. Children or passers by are slapped or otherwise mugged by one or more of a gang while others record the event on video and then distribute it by phone or Internet. Initially the attacks were, as the phrase would have us believe, fairly minor pranks ... As the craze spread the attacks became more vicious – often serious assaults known in legal circles as grievous bodily harm."&lt;ref name=phrases/&gt;

==Legal consequences==

===Denmark===
When the international media attention surrounding attacks abroad reached a high point, a girl was sentenced to eight months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netavisen-sjaelland.dk/news.php?item.326 "8-måneders fængsel for 'happy slapping'"], ''Netavisen Sjaelland'', 9 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; She was sentenced on a number of counts including previous crimes. {{clarify|date=September 2016}}

A common punishment in 2007 was a fine or up to 40 days in prison, suspended if the attacker has no previous record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigsadvokat.dk/media/bilag/RI_17-2007_Bilag_til_redegorelse____244-246.pdf Oversigt over straffene i voldssager efter ændringen af straffelovens §§ 244–246], Prosecutor General of Denmark (Overview of punishments in cases of violence after change of §244–246); accessed 1 September 2016.{{dk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Banke [http://www.bt.dk/article/20060419/krimi/104190023 "Slap med bøde for 'happy slapping'"], BT.dk, 19 April 2006.{{dk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attacker shall be liable to a fine or imprisonment for any term which does not exceed 3 years.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislationline.org/documents/section/criminal-codes/country/34/javascript:void();|title=Criminal codes - Legislationline|website=www.legislationline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Happy slapping is judged as "simple battery" as defined by section 244 of the Danish Criminal Code.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===France===
In February 2007, an amendment aimed at criminalising "happy slapping" was added to a law "on the prevention of delinquency" by the [[Parliament of France]] based on a proposal from then [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Interior Minister]] [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/dossiers/prevention_delinquance.asp Legislative file], assemblee-nationale.fr; accessed 1 September 2016. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=INTX0600091L Law #2007-297], legifrance.gouv.fr; accessed 1 September 2016. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; the anti-happy-slapping clause appears as the last part of Article 44, which also deals with ambushing law enforcement personnel. The law equates filming or photographing certain classes of violent crimes, including severe beatings and rape, with being an [[accomplice]] of such crimes. The law makes it illegal to broadcast the images of such crimes, punishable by up to 5 years in prison and/or a €75,000 fine.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The law does not apply to those who took the above actions in order to obtain evidence in court, or as professional [[journalism]]. Professional journalism is delimited in France by the "press card", which is awarded by a commission representing journalist unions and press organizations.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ccijp.net/ Commission de la carte d'identité des journalistes professionnels]''&lt;/ref&gt; As defined by law,&lt;ref&gt;Work Code, [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CTRAVAIL.rcv&amp;art=L761-2 article L761-2], [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CTRAVAIL.rcv&amp;art=L761-15 article L761-15], [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CTRAVAIL.rcv&amp;art=L761-16 article L761-16]&lt;/ref&gt; a professional journalist is one whose main activity is professional paid journalism.

The bill was signed into law on 5 March 2007, despite some organizations, including [[Reporters Without Borders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=21237|title=Communiqué|work=Reporters Without Borders|accessdate=30 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503213819/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=21237|archivedate=3 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the French chapter of [[Wikimedia France|Wikimedia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikimedia.fr/index.php/Communiqu%C3%A9s_de_presse/Projet_de_loi_prevention_delinquance Communiqué] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that this clause created a legal discrimination in criminal law between professional journalists and ordinary citizens practicing journalism. Specifically, it was argued that citizens filming incidents of [[police brutality]] and publishing such information online could be intimidated by law enforcement into remaining silent, or prosecuted for their actions. This criticism was relayed by the international media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article1490130.ece Criticism of anti-"happy slapping" law], timesonline.co.uk, 9 March 2007.&lt;br&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07070/767887-96.stm Criticism of anti-"happy slapping" law], post-gazette.com, 11 March 2007.&lt;br&gt; [http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/013/410gvlul.asp Criticism of anti-"happy slapping" law], WeeklyStandard.com, 14 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[French presidential election, 2007|French President]] Nicolas Sarkozy declared to Reporters Without Borders that "the spirit of the law is not to infringe of freedom of information. However, if the least doubt subsisted, then I'm in favour of a clarification of the law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsf.org/imprimer.php3?id_article=21704 Communiqué] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930225940/http://www.rsf.org/imprimer.php3?id_article=21704 |date=2007-09-30 }}, [[Reporters without Borders|rsf.org]], 13 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Reponse_Sarkozy.pdf Nicolas Sarkozy comments on "happy slapping" legislation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181146/http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Reponse_Sarkozy.pdf |date=2007-09-30 }}, rsf.org; accessed 1 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In March 2008, a teenage girl who filmed the fatal beating of a man on her mobile phone was sentenced to two years' detention in the first prosecution of its kind in the United Kingdom. The judge stated that the courts had to make an example of such youths. She had pleaded guilty at Leeds Crown Court in February 2008 to [[aiding and abetting]] the [[manslaughter]] of Gavin Waterhouse, 29, from [[Keighley]], [[West Yorkshire]]. Mark Masters, 19, from Keighley, and Sean Thompson, 17, from Bradford, were sentenced to seven and six years respectively after admitting to manslaughter. Waterhouse died from a ruptured spleen after being beaten in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7244782.stm?lsm|title=Happy slap attack girl guilty|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=14 February 2008|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/west_yorkshire/7244782.stm|title='Happy slap' death girl convicted|work=BBC News|date=14  February 2008|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/mar/18/happyslap.killing|title=Girl jailed for filming 'happy-slap' killing|work=The Guardian|date=18 March 2008|accessdate=1 September 2016|location=London, UK|first=Angela|last=Balakrishnan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before the attack, the girl was handed a mobile phone by one of the attackers and told to "video this", prosecutors said. She approached Waterhouse, asked for money, and recorded the subsequent attack. She was sentenced to serve a two-year [[Sentencing in England and Wales#Detention and training orders|detention training order]]. Police said they were satisfied with the court's decision. The Crown Prosecutor said "this is the first time a suspect in England and Wales has been successfully prosecuted for aiding and abetting murder or manslaughter, for the filming of an inaptly called 'happy slapping' incident".&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-slapping-idUKL1884088120080318 "Suspect sentenced for aiding and abetting a 'happy slapping' incident"], news.com.au; accessed 1 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group of British teenagers in the movie ''[[Eden Lake]]'' filmed the torturing and burning of a little boy.

In ''[[Harry Brown (film)|Harry Brown]]'', a teenager films the murder of an elderly man, which [[Michael Caine]]'s character uses as evidence to inflict pain on the teenager.

In Series 2 Episode 1 of British political satire ''[[The Thick of It]]'', Hugh tells Glenn to happy slap Ollie while Hugh takes a picture of it on Ollie's phone.

In ''[[Coronation Street]]'' in November 2013, [[Simon Barlow]] was the victim of a happy slapping incident caused by [[Faye Windass]] and [[Grace Piper]].  Simon was attacked, forced into one of his cousin [[Amy Barlow|Amy]]'s dresses and had lipstick tried to be applied to him. Grace filmed while Faye attacked him.

The '''Hittite Sun Disk''' or '''Hittite Sun Course''' is an ancient [[Anatolia]]n symbol dating back to the 5th century BC.

The disks can be divided into four distinct variations. These are Semi-circular, Diamond shaped, Circular with bulls' horn and circular of semicircular with a complex design including animals and horns. The last one of those types was replicated in a [[Hittite Sun Course Monument|monument]]. The sun disks have been found in at least 13 Royal Tombs from the early bronze age in [[Alacahöyük]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiccanrede.org/2014/07/tales-of-anatolia-from-ankara-to-hattusa-and-the-hittites-part-1/|title=Tales of Anatolia – from Ankara to Hattuşa and the Hittites – part 1|website=wiccanrede.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeless.com.au/hittitesunsymbol.html|title=HITTITE SUN SYMBOL - TIMELESS TOURS' LOGO - Timeless Tours Australia|website=www.timeless.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Description==
[[File:Sundisk Alacahoyuk.jpg|A sun disk found in tombs in Alacahöyük dates back to the early [[Bronze Age]].|thumb|upright]]
"''The symbol belongs to the Hattis from the pre-Hittite period. The Sun Disc is made of bronze, and was commonly used about 4250 years ago in religious ceremonies. The circle which forms the perimeter of the disc represents either the earth or the sun. At the bottom, there are two horn-like protrusions but what they represent is not clear. The protrusions at the top represent fertility, and the procreation of nature. The birds symbolize fertility and the freedom in nature. The sun disc is known to have been made about 300 years prior to the Hittite settlement in Anatolia. Hatti kings were buried in funeral ceremonies typically with 4-5 such symbols of similar design.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.ankara.edu.tr/about/profile-history/the-sun-disc/|title=The Sun Disc - Ankara University|website=en.ankara.edu.tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern uses==
The sun disk is used as the symbol of [[Ankara University]].

A monument, [[Hittite Sun Course Monument]], to the [[Hittites]] was created by the sculptor [[Nusret Suman]] and was erected in [[Sıhhiye Square]] in 1978.

The [[Turkey|Turkish]] food giant [[Eti (company)|Eti]] uses the sun disk as their logo.

'''''Sharaf''''' and '''''ird''''' are [[Bedouin]] honor codes. Along with [[hospitality]] and [[courage|courage/bravery]], it is one of the Bedouin aspects of [[ethics]].&lt;ref name = "patai"&gt;Patai, Raphael. ''[[The Arab Mind]]''. Charles Scribner's Sons: New York, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bedouin systems of justice]] are based on these [[honor code]]s, although the codes are falling into disuse as more Bedouins accept [[sharia]] or national [[penal code]]s as the means for dispensing justice.

==Ird==

''Ird'' is the Bedouin honor code for women. A woman is born with her ''ird'' intact, but sexual transgression can take her ''ird'' away. It is different from [[virginity]], as it is emotional and conceptual. Once lost, ''ird'' cannot be regained.&lt;ref name = "patai"/&gt; 

==Sharaf==
''Sharaf'' is the general Bedouin honor code for men. It can be acquired, augmented, lost, and regained. ''Sharaf'' involves protection of the ''ird'' of the women of the family, protection of [[property]], and maintenance of the honor of the tribe and protection of the village (if the tribe has [[human settlement|settled]]).&lt;ref name = "patai"/&gt;

==Diyafa==

'''''Diyafa''''' (hospitality) is a virtue closely linked to ''sharaf''. If required, even an enemy must be given shelter and fed for some days. [[Poverty]] does not exempt one from one's duties in this regard. [[Generosity]] is a related virtue, and in many Bedouin societies, gifts must be offered and cannot be declined. The destitute are looked after by the community, and [[tithe|tithing]] is mandatory in many Bedouin societies.&lt;ref name = "blake"&gt;Blake, Martha. ''[http://www.marthablake.com/ghinnawa.html The Ghinnawa: How Bedouin Women's Poetry Supplements Social Expression]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hamasa==

'''''Hamasa''''' (courage/bravery) is also closely linked to ''sharaf''. Bravery indicates the willingness to defend one's tribe for the purpose of '''''aṣabīya''''' (tribal solidarity and balance). It is closely related to '''''muruwa''''' ([[Masculinity|manliness]]). It usually entails the ability to withstand pain, including (male) [[circumcision]].&lt;ref name = "blake"/&gt;

{{hatlink|For quality of information in a more general sense, see [[Information quality]].}}
'''Information quality''' ('''InfoQ''') is the potential of a [[data set]] to achieve a specific (scientific or practical) goal using a given [[Empirical research|empirical analysis method]].

== Definition ==
Formally, the definition is InfoQ = U(X,f|g) where X is the data, f the analysis method, g the goal and U the utility function. InfoQ is different from [[data quality]] and [[Efficiency (statistics)|analysis quality]], but is dependent on these components and on the relationship between them. 
   	
InfoQ has been applied in a wide range of domains like healthcare, customer surveys, data science programs, advanced manufacturing and Bayesian network applications.

Kenett and Shmueli (2014) proposed eight dimensions to help assess InfoQ and various methods for increasing InfoQ: Data resolution, [[Data structure]], Data integration, Temporal relevance, Chronology of data and goal, [[Generalization]], [[Operationalization]], Communication.

== Historic development ==

In 1972, [[Daniel Shanks|D. Shanks]] first discovered the infrastructure of a [[Quadratic field|real quadratic number field]] and applied his [[baby-step giant-step]] algorithm to compute the [[Dirichlet's unit theorem#The regulator|regulator]] of such a field in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(D^{1/4+\varepsilon})&lt;/math&gt; binary operations (for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Quadratic field#Discriminant|discriminant]] of the quadratic field; previous methods required &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(D^{1/2+\varepsilon})&lt;/math&gt; binary operations.&lt;ref name="shanks-infrastructure"&gt;D. Shanks: The infrastructure of a real quadratic field and its applications. Proceedings of the Number Theory Conference (Univ. Colorado, Boulder, Colo., 1972), pp. 217-224. University of Colorado, Boulder, 1972. {{MR|389842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, [[Hendrik Lenstra|H. W. Lenstra]] published&lt;ref name="lenstra-infrastructure"&gt;H. W. Lenstra Jr.: On the calculation of regulators and class numbers of quadratic fields. Number theory days, 1980 (Exeter, 1980), 123&amp;ndash;150, London Math. Soc. Lecture Note Ser., 56, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1982. {{MR|697260}}&lt;/ref&gt; a mathematical framework describing the infrastructure of a real quadratic number field in terms of "circular groups". It was also described by R. Schoof&lt;ref name="schoof-infrastructure1"&gt;R. J. Schoof: Quadratic fields and factorization. Computational methods in number theory, Part II, 235&amp;ndash;286, Math. Centre Tracts, 155, Math. Centrum, Amsterdam, 1982. {{MR|702519}}&lt;/ref&gt; and H. C. Williams,&lt;ref name="williams-infrastructure1"&gt;H. C.

Math. 15 (1985), no. 2, 621&amp;ndash;655. {{MR|823273}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later extended by H. C. Williams, G. W. Dueck and B. K.

Williams: On the infrastructure of the principal ideal class of an algebraic number field of unit rank one. Math. Comp. 50 (1988), no. 182, 569&amp;ndash;579. {{MR|929554}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Habilitation|habilitation thesis]], J. Buchmann presented a baby-step giant-step algorithm to compute the regulator of a number field of ''arbitrary'' unit rank.&lt;ref name="buchmann-habil"&gt;J. Buchmann: Zur Komplexität der Berechnung von Einheiten und Klassenzahlen algebraischer Zahlkörper. Habilitationsschrift, Düsseldorf, 1987. [http://www.cdc.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/~buchmann/Lecture%20Notes/habil.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; The first description of infrastructures in number fields of arbitrary unit rank was given by R. Schoof using [[Arakelov divisor]]s in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;R. Schoof: Computing Arakelov class groups. (English summary) Algorithmic number theory: lattices, number fields, curves and cryptography, 447&amp;ndash;495, Math. Sci. Res. Inst. Publ., 44, Cambridge University Press, 2008. {{MR|2467554}} [http://www.mat.uniroma2.it/~schoof/papers.html PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

The infrastructure was also described for other [[global field]]s, namely for [[algebraic function field]]s over [[finite field]]s. This was done first by A. Stein and H. G. Zimmer in the case of real [[Hyperelliptic curve|hyperelliptic]] function fields.&lt;ref name="stein-zimmer"&gt;A. Stein, H. G. Zimmer: An algorithm for determining the regulator and the fundamental unit of hyperelliptic congruence function field. In "Proceedings of the 1991 International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation, ISSAC '91," Association for Computing Machinery, (1991), 183&amp;ndash;184.&lt;/ref&gt; It was extended to certain cubic function fields of unit rank one by R. Scheidler and A. Stein.&lt;ref name="stein-scheidler-cubicinfra"&gt;R. Scheidler, A. Stein: Unit computation in purely cubic function fields of unit rank 1. (English summary) Algorithmic number theory (Portland, OR, 1998), 592&amp;ndash;606, Lecture Notes in Comput.

Rück related the infrastructure of a real quadratic function field to the divisor class group.&lt;ref name="paulus-rueck"&gt;S. Paulus, H.-G. Rück: Real and imaginary quadratic representations of hyperelliptic function fields. (English summary) Math. Comp. 68 (1999), no. 227, 1233&amp;ndash;1241. {{MR|1627817}}&lt;/ref&gt; This connection can be generalized to arbitrary function fields and, combining with R. Schoof's results, to all global fields.&lt;ref name="fontein-infrastructure"&gt;{{cite journal | first=F. | last=Fontein | title=The Infrastructure of a Global Field of Arbitrary Unit Rank | journal=Math. Comp. | volume=80 | year=2011 | number=276 | pages=2325–2357 | doi=	10.1090/S0025-5718-2011-02490-7 | arxiv=0809.1685 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== One-dimensional case ==

=== Abstract definition ===

A '''one-dimensional (abstract) infrastructure''' &lt;math&gt;(X, d)&lt;/math&gt; consists of a [[real number]] &lt;math&gt;R &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, a [[finite set]] &lt;math&gt;X \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; together with an [[Injective function|injective]] map &lt;math&gt;d : X \to \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="fontein-pohlighellman"&gt;F. Fontein: Groups from cyclic infrastructures and Pohlig-Hellman in certain infrastructures. (English summary) Adv. Math. Commun. 2 (2008), no. 3, 293&amp;ndash;307. {{MR|2429459}}&lt;/ref&gt; The map &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is often called the ''distance map''.

By interpreting &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; as a [[circle]] of [[circumference]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and by identifying &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;d(X)&lt;/math&gt;, one can see a one-dimensional infrastructure as a circle with a finite set of points on it.

=== Baby steps ===

A '''baby step''' is a [[unary operation]] &lt;math&gt;bs : X \to X&lt;/math&gt; on a one-dimensional infrastructure &lt;math&gt;(X, d)&lt;/math&gt;. Visualizing the infrastructure as a circle, a baby step assigns each point of &lt;math&gt;d(X)&lt;/math&gt; the next one. Formally, one can define this by assigning to &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; the real number &lt;math&gt;f_x := \inf\{ f' &gt; 0 \mid d(x) + f' \in d(X) \}&lt;/math&gt;; then, one can define &lt;math&gt;bs(x) := d^{-1}(d(x) + f_x)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Giant steps and reduction maps ===

Observing that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is naturally an [[abelian group]], one can consider the sum &lt;math&gt;d(x) + d(y) \in \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt;. In general, this is not an element of &lt;math&gt;d(X)&lt;/math&gt;. But instead, one can take an element of &lt;math&gt;d(X)&lt;/math&gt; which lies ''nearby''. To formalize this concept, assume that there is a map &lt;math&gt;red : \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z} \to X&lt;/math&gt;; then, one can define &lt;math&gt;gs(x, y) := red(d(x) + d(y))&lt;/math&gt; to obtain a [[binary operation]] &lt;math&gt;gs : X \times X \to X&lt;/math&gt;, called the '''giant step''' operation. Note that this operation is in general ''not'' [[Associativity|associative]].

The main difficulty is how to choose the map &lt;math&gt;red&lt;/math&gt;. Assuming that one wants to have the condition &lt;math&gt;red \circ d = \mathrm{id}_X&lt;/math&gt;, a range of possibilities remain.   One possible choice&lt;ref name="fontein-pohlighellman" /&gt; is given as follows: for &lt;math&gt;v \in \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;f_v := \inf\{ f \ge 0 \mid v - f \in d(X) \}&lt;/math&gt;; then one can define &lt;math&gt;red(v) := d^{-1}(v - f_v)&lt;/math&gt;. This choice, seeming somewhat arbitrary, appears in a natural way when one tries to obtain infrastructures from global fields.&lt;ref name="fontein-infrastructure" /&gt; Other choices are possible as well, for example choosing an element &lt;math&gt;x \in d(X)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|d(x) - v|&lt;/math&gt; is minimal (here, &lt;math&gt;|d(x) - v|&lt;/math&gt; is stands for &lt;math&gt;\inf\{ |f - v| \mid f \in d(x) \}&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;d(x)&lt;/math&gt; is of the form &lt;math&gt;v + R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;); one possible construction in the case of real quadratic hyperelliptic function fields is given by S. D. Galbraith, M. Harrison and D. J. Mireles Morales.&lt;ref name="galbraith-harrison-mirelesmorales"&gt;S. D. Galbraith, M. Harrison, D. J. Mireles Morales: Efficient hyperelliptic arithmetic using balanced representation for divisors. (English summary) Algorithmic number theory, 342&amp;ndash;356, Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci., 5011, Springer, Berlin, 2008. {{MR|2467851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relation to real quadratic fields ===

D. Shanks observed the infrastructure in real quadratic number fields when he was looking at cycles of reduced [[binary quadratic form]]s. Note that there is a close relation between reducing binary quadratic forms and [[continued fraction]] expansion; one step in the continued fraction expansion of a certain [[quadratic irrational]]ity gives a [[unary operation]] on the set of reduced forms, which cycles through all reduced forms in one equivalence class. Arranging all these reduced forms in a cycle, Shanks noticed that one can quickly jump to reduced forms further away from the beginning of the circle by [[Composition of binary quadratic forms|composing]] two such forms and reducing the result. He called this [[binary operation]] on the set of reduced forms a '''giant step''', and the operation to go to the next reduced form in the cycle a '''baby step'''.

=== Relation to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; ===

The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; has a natural group operation and the giant step operation is defined in terms of it. Hence, it makes sense to compare the arithmetic in the infrastructure to the arithmetic in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. It turns out that the group operation of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; can be described using giant steps and baby steps, by representing elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; by elements of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; together with a relatively small real number; this has been first described by D. Hühnlein and S. Paulus&lt;ref name="huehnlein-paulus"&gt;D. Hühnlein, S. Paulus: On the implementation of cryptosystems based on real quadratic number fields (extended abstract). Selected areas in cryptography (Waterloo, ON, 2000), 288&amp;ndash;302, Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci., 2012, Springer, 2001. {{MR|1895598}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by M. J. Jacobson, Jr., R. Scheidler and H. C. Williams&lt;ref name="jacobson-scheidler-williams"&gt;M. J. Jacobson Jr., R. Scheidler, H. C. Williams: The efficiency and security of a real quadratic field based key exchange protocol. Public-key cryptography and computational number theory (Warsaw, 2000), 89&amp;ndash;112, de Gruyter, Berlin, 2001 {{MR|1881630}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of infrastructures obtained from real quadratic number fields. They used floating point numbers to represent the real numbers, and called these representations CRIAD-representations resp. &lt;math&gt;(f, p)&lt;/math&gt;-representations. More generally, one can define a similar concept for all one-dimensional infrastructures; these are sometimes called &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-representations.&lt;ref name="fontein-pohlighellman" /&gt;

A '''set of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-representations''' is a subset &lt;math&gt;fRep&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X \times \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; such that the map &lt;math&gt;\Psi_{fRep} : fRep \to \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}, \; (x, f) \mapsto d(x) + f&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection and that &lt;math&gt;(x, 0) \in fRep&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;red : \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z} \to X&lt;/math&gt; is a reduction map, &lt;math&gt;fRep_{red} := \{ (x, f) \in X \times \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z} \mid red(d(x) + f) = x \}&lt;/math&gt; is a set of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-representations; conversely, if &lt;math&gt;fRep&lt;/math&gt; is a set of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-representations, one can obtain a reduction map by setting &lt;math&gt;red(f) = \pi_1(\Psi_{fRep}^{-1}(f))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\pi_1 : X \times \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z} \to X, \; (x, f) \mapsto x&lt;/math&gt; is the projection on $X$. Hence, sets of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-representations and reduction maps are in a [[one-to-one correspondence]].

Using the bijection &lt;math&gt;\Psi_{fRep} : fRep \to \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, one can pull over the group operation on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;fRep&lt;/math&gt;, hence turning &lt;math&gt;fRep&lt;/math&gt; into an abelian group &lt;math&gt;(fRep, +)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x + y := \Psi_{fRep}^{-1}(\Psi_{fRep}(x) + \Psi_{fRep}(y))&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x, y \in fRep&lt;/math&gt;. In certain cases, this group operation can be explicitly described without using &lt;math&gt;\Psi_{fRep}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

In case one uses the reduction map &lt;math&gt;red : \mathbb{R}/R\mathbb{Z} \to X, \; v \mapsto d^{-1}(v - \inf\{ f \ge 0 \mid v - f \in d(X) \})&lt;/math&gt;, one obtains &lt;math&gt;fRep_{red} = \{ (x, f) \mid f \ge 0, \; \forall f' \in [0, f) : d(x) + f' \not\in d(X) \}&lt;/math&gt;. Given &lt;math&gt;(x, f), (x', f') \in fRep_{red}&lt;/math&gt;, one can consider &lt;math&gt;(x'', f'')&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x'' = gs(x, x')&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f'' = f + f' + (d(x) + d(x') - d(gs(x, x'))) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;; this is in general no element of &lt;math&gt;fRep_{red}&lt;/math&gt;, but one can reduce it as follows: one computes &lt;math&gt;bs^{-1}(x'')&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f'' - (d(x'') - d(bs^{-1}(x'')))&lt;/math&gt;; in case the latter is not negative, one replaces &lt;math&gt;(x'', f'')&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;(bs^{-1}(x''), f'' - (d(x'') - d(bs^{-1}(x''))))&lt;/math&gt; and continues. If the value was negative, one has that &lt;math&gt;(x'', f'') \in fRep_{red}&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;\Psi_{fRep_{red}}(x, f) + \Psi_{fRep_{red}}(x', f') = \Psi_{fRep_{red}}(x'', f'')&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;(x, f) + (x', f') = (x'', f'')&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Two people talking.tiff|thumb|Two people talking]]

'''Interaction''' is a kind of [[action (physics)|action]] that occur as two or more objects have an effect upon one another. The idea of a two-way effect is essential in the concept of interaction, as opposed to a one-way [[Causality|causal]] effect. A closely related term is [[interconnectivity]], which deals with the interactions of interactions within systems: combinations of many simple interactions can lead to surprising [[Emergence|emergent]] phenomena. ''Interaction'' has different tailored meanings in various [[science]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Changes can also involve interaction.

Casual examples of interaction outside science include:{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
* Communication of any sort, for example two or more people talking to each other, or communication among [[Group (sociology)|groups]], organizations, nations or states: trade, migration, [[International relations|foreign relations]], transportation.
* The [[feedback]] during the operation of a machine such as a computer or tool, for example the interaction between a driver and the position of his or her car on the road: by steering the driver influences this position, by observation this information returns to the driver.

== Physics ==
{{main|Force|Fundamental interaction}}

In [[physics]], a fundamental interaction (depending on the nature of the interaction, it might also be called a fundamental force) is a process by which [[elementary particle]]s interact with each other. An interaction is often described as a physical [[quantum field theory|field]], and is mediated by the exchange of [[gauge boson]]s between particles. For example, the interaction of [[electric charge|charged]] particles takes place through the mediation of [[electromagnetic field]]s, whereas [[beta decay]] occurs by means of the [[weak interaction]]. An interaction is fundamental when it cannot be described in terms of other interactions.  There are four known fundamental interactions in nature: The  [[quantum electrodynamics|electromagnetic]],  [[Strong nuclear force|strong]], [[Weak interaction|weak]] and  [[general relativity|gravitational]] interactions. The weak and electromagnetic interactions are unified in  [[electroweak interaction|electroweak theory]], which is unified with the strong force in the [[standard model]].

=== Biochemistry ===

====Molecular biology====
{{Main|List of protein interactions|Interactome}}
In [[molecular biology]], the knowledge on [[gene]]/[[protein]] interaction among themselves and with their [[metabolite]]s is referred to as [[molecular pathway]]s.

==== Medicine and pharmacology ====
{{main|Drug interaction}}
{{also|Poly drug use#Dangerous interactions}}

In [[medicine]], most [[medication]]s can be safely used with other medicines, but particular combinations of medicines need to be monitored for interactions, often by the pharmacist. Interactions between medications fall generally into one of two main categories:
# [[pharmacodynamic]] : Involving the actions of the two interacting drugs.
# [[pharmacokinetic]] : Involving the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of one or both of the interacting drugs upon the other.

In terms of [[efficacy]], there can be three types of interactions between medications: additive, synergistic, and antagonistic.
* Additive interaction means the effect of two chemicals is equal to the sum of the effect of the two chemicals taken separately. This is usually due to the two chemicals acting on the body via same or similar mechanism. Examples are [[aspirin]] and [[motrin]], [[alcohol]] and [[depressant]], [[tranquilizer]] and [[painkiller]].
* [[Synergistic]] interaction means that the effect of two chemicals taken together is greater than the sum of their separate effect at the same doses. An example is [[pesticide]] and [[fertilizer]]; the biological effect is devastating.
* [[Antagonism (chemistry)|Antagonistic interaction]] means that the effect of two chemicals is actually less than the sum of the effect of the two drugs taken independently of each other. This is because the second chemical increases the excretion of the first, or even directly blocks its toxic actions. Antagonism forms the basis for [[antidote]]s of poisonings.

==Biology and genetics==

[[Geneticist]]s work with a number of different genetic interaction modes to characterize how the combination of two [[mutation]]s affect (or does not affect) the [[phenotype]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

noninteractive, synthetic, asynthetic, suppressive, epistatic, conditional, additive, single-nonmonotonic and double-nonmonotonic.
Further characterizations is enhancement interaction and nonadditive interaction. [[Biosemiotic]]ists investigate sign-mediated interactions within and between organisms that underlie syntactic, pragmatic and semantic rules.

The word [[epistasis]] is also used for genetic interaction in some contexts.

{{main|Interactivity}}

== Sociology ==
{{main|Social interaction}}

In [[sociology]], [[social interaction]] is a dynamic, changing sequence of [[social action]]s between individuals (or groups) who modify their actions and reactions due to the actions by their interaction partner(s). Social interactions can be differentiated into accidental, repeated, regular, and regulated. Social interactions form the basis of [[social relation]]s.

== Statistics ==
{{main|Interaction (statistics)}}

In [[statistics]], an '''interaction''' is a term in a [[statistical model]] in which the effect of two, or more, variables is not simply additive.

=== An example from statistics applied to health science ===
If we were examining the effect of two variables, gender and [[premature birth]], on health outcomes, we would describe any difference in health outcome scores between genders as a [[main effect]]. Similarly any difference in scores of full term/premature birth would be described as a main effect. The presence of an interaction effect implies that the effect of gender on health outcome varies as a function of premature birth status.

'''[[Sexual violence]]''' includes, but is not limited to [[rape]]. Although there is no agreed upon definition of sexual violence, commonly applied ones encompass any act of a sexual nature or attempt to obtain a sexual act carried out through coercion. Sexual violence also includes physical and psychological violence directed at a person's sexuality, including unwanted comments or advances, or acts of traffic such as forced [[prostitution]] or [[sexual slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;[WHO (2002), 'Sexual violence', in World Report in violence and health, Chapter 6, pp. 149]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Elements of Crimes, Article 7(1)(g)-6 Crimes against humanity of sexual violence, elements 1.

(1998), Special Rapporteur, Contemporary forms of slavery: systematic rape, sexual slavery and slavery-like practices during armed conflict, Final report submitted by Ms. Jay J. McDougall, Special Rapporteur, E/CN.4/Sub.2/1998/13, para. 21]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual violence, in times of peace and armed conflict situations, is widespread and considered to be one of the most traumatic, pervasive, and most common violations human beings suffer.&lt;ref name="Lindsey2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindsey|first=Charlotte|title=Women facing war|year=2001|publisher=ICRC|location=Geneva|pages=57–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="icrc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Advancement of women: ICRC statement to the United Nations, 2013|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/statement/2013/united-nations-women-statement-2013-10-16.htm|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a serious public health and human rights problem and has profound short- and long- term impacts on physical and mental health. Though women and girls suffer disproportionately from this kind of violence, it can occur to anybody at any age. It is also an act of violence that can be perpetrated by parents, caregivers, acquaintances, and strangers, as well as intimate partners. Sexual violence is rarely a crime of passion; it is an aggressive act that frequently aims to express power and dominance over the victim.

Sexual violence remains highly stigmatized in all settings; thus, levels of disclosure of the assault vary between regions. In general, it is widely under-reported; thus, available data tend to underestimate the true scale of the problem. In addition, sexual violence is also a neglected area of research; thus, deeper understanding of the issue is needed to promote a coordinated movement against it. It is important to distinguish between domestic sexual violence and conflict-related sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;[Human Security Report (2012), Sexual Violence, Education and War: Beyond the mainstream narrative, Human Security Research Group, Simon Fraser University, Canada, Human Security Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Often, people who coerce their spouses into sexual acts believe their actions are legitimate because they are married. In times of conflict, sexual violence tends to be an inevitable repercussion of warfare trapped in an ongoing cycle of impunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=International Committee of the Red Cross|title=Women and War|year=2008|publisher=ICRC|location=Geneva|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|title=The shame of war: sexual violence against women and girls in conflict|year=2007|publisher=OCHA/IRIN Publication|pages=57–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rape is often used as a weapon of war, as a form of attack on the enemy, typifying the conquest and degradation of its women or men or captured fighters of any gender.&lt;ref&gt;Swiss S et al. Violence against women during the Liberian civil conflict. Journal of the American Medical Association, 1998, 279:625–629.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though [[international humanitarian law]] (IHL) strongly prohibits sexual violence in all armed conflicts and [[international human rights law]] (IHRL) and [[international customary law]] strongly prohibit it at all times, enforcement mechanisms are fragile or do not exist in many parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Lindsey2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="icrc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Physicians2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Physicians for Human Rights|title=War-related sexual violence in Sierra Leone : a population-based assessment : a report|year=2002|publisher=Physicians for Human Rights|location=Boston, MA|isbn=1-879707-37-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="United2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|title=The shame of war: sexual violence against women and girls in conflict|year=2007|publisher=OCHA/IRIN Publication}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acts of sexual violence can be charged as a [[crime against humanity]], [[genocide]], [[war crime]], or grave breach of the [[Geneva Conventions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bassiouni|first=M.

== International humanitarian law ==

{{rquote|right| In no other area is our collective failure to ensure effective protection for [[civilians]] more apparent – and by its very nature more shameful – than in terms of the masses of women and girls, but also boys and men, whose lives are destroyed each year by sexual violence perpetrated in conflict.|

References to sexual offences and violence provided in IHL instruments are only partially expressed in the [[1949 Geneva Conventions]], and even more vaguely considered in the 1977 Additional Protocols.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/additional-protocols-1977.htm%20 1977 Additional Protocols]. Retrieved 9 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindsey2001" /&gt; By prohibiting sexual violence in a non-discriminatory manner, [[international humanitarian law]] ensures that women are protected through a two-tiered approach, being covered by general (equal protection as men) and specific protections. IHL mandates special protections to women, according to their additional needs in situations in which they find themselves more vulnerable, for example women who are widows, sick and wounded, migrants, internally displaced, or held in detention.&lt;ref name="icrc_a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Customary IHL.

{{rquote|right|[[Rape]] and other forms of sexual violence that amount to serious violations of international humanitarian law entail [[Criminal responsibility|individual criminal responsibility]] and must be prosecuted. All States are obliged to criminalize these violations under [[domestic law]], and to effectively investigate and prosecute any instance of sexual violence.|
[[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC)&lt;ref name="icrc" /&gt;}}

Although evidence of sexual atrocities such as [[mass rape]]s is acknowledged in the [[Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal]] and [[Tokyo Tribunal]], references to sexual violence in their respective charter are absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Violence and Armed Conflict: United Nations Response|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/cover.pdf|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR), the [[International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY), the hybrid [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] and the [[Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia]] consider sexual violence as a public tool of war rather than a private crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=St-Germain|first= Tonia|title=Conflict-related sexual violence : international law, local responses|year=2012|publisher=Kumarian Press|location=Sterling, Va.|isbn=978-1-56549-504-3|pages=53–70|author2=Dewey, Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analytical and Conceptual Framing of Conflict-Related Sexual Violence|url=http://www.stoprapenow.org/uploads/advocacyresources/1321456915.pdf|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groundbreaking [[case law]] both by the ''ad hoc'' Tribunals of [[ICTR]] and [[ICTY]] established unprecedented developments by classifying acts of [[war rape|rape]] and sexual violence as [[Genocide#As a crime|crimes of genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindsey|first=Charlotte|title=Women facing war|year=2001|publisher=ICRC|location=Geneva|pages=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=St-Germain|first= Tonia|title=Conflict-related sexual violence : international law, local responses|year=2012|publisher=Kumarian Press|location=Sterling, Va.|isbn=978-1-56549-504-3|pages=55–57|author2=Dewey, Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Akayesu#Trial|Akayesu case]] goes beyond [[domestic law]] definitions of sexual violence and is the first case in which sexual violence is perceived as an integral part of [[genocide]] as defined in the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]].&lt;ref name="unictr"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prosecutor v.

The first trial solely focused on the perpetration of systematic sexual violence ([[rape camps]]) and on [[crimes against humanity]] committed against women and girls was in the [[Foča massacres|Foca case]], a ruling before the [[International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case information sheet on the Foca Case (Kunarac, Kovac &amp; Vukovic) (IT-96-23 and 23/1)|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/kunarac/cis/en/cis_kunarac_al_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prosecutor v.

An extensive amount of both [[Hard law|hard]] and [[soft law]] instruments set rules, standards and norms for the protection of victims of sexual offences. Among the wide range of international human rights law instruments are the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (1979),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1979), art. 6 |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm#article6 |accessdate=29 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xc2eRFDv?url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm |archivedate=1 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] (1993), the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women (1994),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/brazil1994.html Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against Women (1994)]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa]] (2003), and the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] (1993). The [[UN Security Council]], [[ECOSOC]] and the [[UN Commission on Human Rights]] do not take into account the nature of the conflict with respect to the protection of women in war time.&lt;ref name="icrc_a" /&gt;

Five UN Security Council Resolutions specifically address sexual violence:

The first time the [[Security Council]] addressed the impacts of armed conflict on women was in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325|Resolution 1325 (2000)]]. The document focuses on the need for specific protections for women and girls in conflict and expresses the need to consider gender perspectives in mission, UN peace support operations, and post-conflict processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peace Women. Women, Peac and Security: Resolution 1325|url=http://peacewomen.org/themes_theme.php?id=15&amp;subtheme=true|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Resolution 1820|Resolution 1820 (2008)]] of the [[UN Security Council]] declares that [[rape]] and other forms of sexual violence "can constitute [[war crimes]], [[crimes against humanity]] or a constitutive act with respect to [[genocide]]".

[[File:Zainab Bangura giving a radio interview in Kinshasa (8654821769).jpg|thumb|Zainab Bangura, the United Nations Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict since September 2012]]
[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888|Resolution 1888 (2009)]] is perceived as an advancement in international law as it created the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary General for Sexual Violence in Conflict (SRSG-SVC).&lt;ref name="un" /&gt; The first Special Representative, [[Margot Wallström]], was appointed in April 2010. The current Special Representative [[Zainab Hawa Bangura]] took office in September 2012. The Office identified eight priority countries: [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]; [[Central African Republic]] (CAR); [[Colombia]]; [[Cote d’Ivoire]]; [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (DRC); [[Liberia]]; [[South Sudan]] and [[Sudan]].&lt;ref name="un"&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Sexual Violence in Conflict|url=https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/about-us/about-the-office/|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; SRSG-SVC is also engaged in the Middle East ([[Syria]]) and in Asia and the Pacific ([[Cambodia]]).&lt;ref name="un" /&gt;

The six priorities of the Office are:

# to end impunity for sexual violence in conflict by assisting national authorities to strengthen criminal accountability, responsiveness to survivors and judicial capacity;
# the protection and empowerment of civilians who face sexual violence in conflict, in particular, women and girls who are targeted disproportionately by this crime;
# to mobilize political ownership by fostering government engagement in developing and implementing strategies to combat sexual violence;
# to increase recognition of rape as a tactic and consequence of war through awareness-raising activities at the international and country levels;
# to harmonise the UN’s response by leading [[UN Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict]], a network of focal points from 13 UN agencies that amplify programming and advocacy on this issue in the wider UN agenda;
# to emphasize greater national ownership.&lt;ref name="un" /&gt;

[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1960|Resolution 1960 (2010)]] reaffirms that sexual violence is systematic, rampant and widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Council Open Debate on Sexual Violence in Conflict, December 2010 (Security Council Resolution 1960)|url=http://www.peacewomen.org/security_council_monitor/debate-watch/all-debates/26/open-debate-on-sexual-violence-in-conflict|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution creates new institutional tools for the prevention and protection from sexual violence. The aim of the resolution is to provide further steps for combating impunity and recognizing sexual violence as a serious breach of human rights law and international humanitarian law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Provisional Guidance Note - Implementation of Security Council Resolution 1960 (2010) On Women, Peace and Security (conflict-related sexual violence)|url=http://www.refworld.org/publisher,SRSG_SVC,,,4e23ed5d2,0.html|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''Ishikawa diagrams''' (also called '''fishbone diagrams''', '''herringbone diagrams''', '''cause-and-effect diagrams''', or '''Fishikawa''') are [[causal diagram]]s created by [[Kaoru Ishikawa]] that show the [[cause]]s of a specific event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ishikawa |first = Kaoru | title= Guide to Quality Control | year = 1968 | publisher = JUSE | location = Tokyo
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Common uses of the Ishikawa diagram are [[product design]] and quality defect prevention to identify potential factors causing an overall effect. Each cause or reason for imperfection is a source of variation. Causes are usually grouped into major categories to identify and classify these sources of variation.

==Overview==
[[File:Fishbone BadCoffeeExample.jpg|thumb|left|Sample Ishikawa diagram shows the causes contributing to inferior coffee being brewed]]

The ''defect'' is shown as the fish's head, facing to the right, with the ''causes'' extending to the left as fishbones; the ribs branch off the backbone for major causes, with sub-branches for root-causes, to as many levels as required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guide to Quality Control|last=Ishikawa|first=Kaoru|publisher=Asian Productivity Organization|year=1976|isbn=92-833-1036-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ishikawa diagrams were popularized in the 1960s by [[Kaoru Ishikawa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2001 |title=Infusion Therapy in Clinical Practice |first=Judy |last=Hankins |pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; who pioneered quality management processes in the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] shipyards, and in the process became one of the founding fathers of modern management.

The basic concept was first used in the 1920s, and is considered one of the [[Seven Basic Tools of Quality|seven basic tools]] of [[quality control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.asq.org/learn-about-quality/seven-basic-quality-tools/overview/overview.html |first=Nancy R. | last=Tague | title = Seven Basic Quality Tools | year = 2004 | work = The Quality Toolbox | publisher = American Society for Quality | location = Milwaukee, Wisconsin | page = 15 | accessdate = 2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known as a fishbone diagram because of its shape, similar to the side view of a fish skeleton.

[[Mazda|Mazda Motors]] famously used an Ishikawa diagram in the development of the [[Mazda MX-5 Miata|Miata]] ([[Mazda MX-5|MX5]]) sports car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/769756418|title=Improving complex systems today : proceedings of the 18th ISPE International Conference on Concurrent Engineering|last=Frey|first=Daniel D.|last2=1943-|first2=Fukuda, S.

==Root causes==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
[[Root cause analysis|Root-cause analysis]] is intended to reveal key relationships among  various variables, and the possible causes provide additional insight into process behavior. 

The causes emerge by analysis, often through brainstorming sessions, and are grouped into categories on the main branches off the fishbone. To help structure the approach, the categories are often selected from one of the common models shown below, but may emerge as something unique to the application in a specific case. 

Each potential cause is traced back to find the root cause, often using the [[5 Whys]] technique. 

Typical categories include: 

===The 5 Ms (used in manufacturing)===
{{See also|5M model}}Originating with lean manufacturing and the [[Toyota Production System]], the 5 Ms is one of the most common frameworks for root-cause analysis:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/921141300|title=Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEAs) for small business owners and non-engineers : determining and preventing what can go wrong|last=Weeden|first=Marcia M.|publisher=|year=1952|isbn=0873899180|location=|pages=|oclc=921141300}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Machine (equipment, technology)
*Method (process)
*Material (includes raw material, consumables, and information)
*Man / mind power (physical or knowledge work, includes: [[kaizen]]s, suggestions)
*Measurement / medium (inspection, environment)
These have been expanded by some to include an additional three, and are referred to as the 8 Ms:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/963184495|title=Reliability engineering : a life cycle approach|last=Bradley|first=Edgar|publisher=|year=|isbn=1498765378|location=|pages=|oclc=963184495}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mission / mother nature (purpose, environment)
*Management / money power (leadership)
*Maintenance

===The 8 Ps (used in product marketing)===
{{See also|Marketing mix}}This common model for identifying crucial attributes for planning in product marketing is often also used in root-cause analysis as categories for the Ishikawa diagram:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Product (or service)
*Price 
*Promotion
*Place
*Process
*People (personnel)
*Physical evidence
*Performance
The 8 Ps are primarily used in product marketing.

===The 4 Ss (used in service industries)===
An alternative used for service industries, uses four categories of possible cause:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/904826764|title=Handbook of Lean Manufacturing in the Food Industry|last=Dudbridge|first=Michael|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=1444393111|location=|pages=|oclc=904826764}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Surroundings
*Suppliers
*Systems
*Skill

=== Fishbone Diagram in Lean ===

A recurring theme in a lean or [[Six Sigma]] transformation is removing the clutter to reveal waste or opportunities for improvement. A fishbone diagram aims to break down and organise the Causes of an issue to reveal what elements have the greatest impact. Grouping the “causes” means you can think about the different elements of the problem as separate from the overall process. One or two of these “causes” will have a greater effect than the others and will guide you to the root of the problem. This structure also allows you to tackle smaller chunks which have a large impact on the problem. Looking at elements of the problem and not the whole process will likely make finding your solution less daunting and problem solving more manageable. 

After you have determined your root cause, prioritise or screen the causes to determine which are having the largest effect. Once identified focus on these. An easy Cause screening method involves looking at each one and asking two questions:

How likely is this cause to be the major source of the issue or variation?

*V - Very Likely
*S - Somewhat Likely
*N - Not Likely

How easy would it be to fix or control?

*V - Very Easy
*S - Somewhat Easy
*N - Not Easy

Put the answers of the two questions together. Work on the Causes that have a result of VV, VS, and SV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lbspartners.ie/fishbone-diagram/ |title=Fishbone Diagram – How to Make and Use a Fishbone Diagram |website=www.lbspartners.ie |publisher=LBSPartners |access-date=17 August 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jakob Johann [[Baron]] von Uexküll''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʏkskʏl|lang}}; 8 September 1864 – 25 July 1944) was a [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] biologist who worked in the fields of muscular [[physiology]], animal behaviour studies, and the [[cybernetics]] of [[life]]. However, his most notable contribution is the notion of ''[[Umwelt]]'', used by [[Semiotics|semiotician]] [[Thomas Sebeok]] and philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]]. His works established [[biosemiotics]] &lt;ref&gt;Donald Favareau, ''Essential Readings in Biosemiotics'', Springer, 2010, 91-89.&lt;/ref&gt; as a field of research.

==Early life==
The son of [[Alexander Rudolf Karl von Uexküll|Alexander Baron von Uexküll]] and Sophie von Hahn, Jakob von Uexküll was born in the Keblas estate, [[Mihkli]], [[Governorate of Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://personen.digitale-sammlungen.de/baltlex/Blatt_bsb00000600,00507.html?prozent= Genealogisches ''Handbuch der baltischen Ritterschaften'', 1930, p. 490.]&lt;/ref&gt; His aristocratic family lost most of their fortune by expropriation during the Russian Revolution. Needing to support himself, Uexküll took a job as professor at the [[University of Hamburg]] where he founded the ''Institut für Umweltforschung''.&lt;ref name="Agamben 39"&gt;[[Giorgio Agamben]], ''The Open: Man and Animal'', trans. Kevin Attell, Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2004, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Umwelt==
{{main|Umwelt}}

Uexküll was particularly interested in how living beings [[Perception|perceive]] their [[Natural environment|environment]](s). He argued that organisms experience life in terms of species-specific, spatio-temporal, 'self-in-world' subjective reference frames that he called ''Umwelt'' (translated as ''surrounding-world'',&lt;ref&gt;Jakob von Uexküll, ''Theoretical Biology'', New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1926, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; ''phenomenal world''&lt;ref name=Uexküll1957&gt;Jakob von Uexküll, ''A Stroll Through the Worlds of Animals and Men: A Picture Book of Invisible Worlds''. In ''Instinctive Behavior: The Development of a Modern Concept'', edited and translated by Claire H. Schiller, New York: International Universities Press, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;, ''self-world''&lt;ref name=Uexküll1957/&gt;, ''environment''&lt;ref&gt;Jakob von Uexküll, ''A Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans: With A Theory of Meaning'', translated by Joseph D. O'Neil, Minneapolis/London: University of Minnesota Press, 2010, pp. 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;  - lit. German ''environment''). These ''Umwelten'' (plural of ''Umwelt'') are distinctive from what Uexküll termed the "[[Umgebung]]" which would be the living being's surroundings as seen from the likewise peculiar perspective or ''Umwelt'' of the human observer. ''Umwelt'' may thus be defined as the perceptual world in which an organism exists and acts as a subject. By studying how the senses of various organisms like  [[tick]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, [[amoebae]], [[jellyfish]] and [[sea worms]] work, he was able to build theories of how they experience the world. Because all organisms perceive and react to sensory data as signs, Uexküll argued that they were to be considered as living subjects. This argument was the basis for his biological theory in which the characteristics of biological existence ("life") could not simply be described as a sum of its non-organic parts, but had to be described as subject and a part of a sign system.

The [[biosemiotic]] turn in Jakob von Uexküll's analysis occurs in his discussion of the animal's relationship with its environment. The ''Umwelt'' is for him an environment-world which is (according to [[Giorgio Agamben]]), "constituted by a more or less broad series of elements [called] "carriers of significance" or "marks" which are the only things that interest the animal". Agamben goes on to paraphrase one example from Uexküll's discussion of a tick, saying,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...this eyeless animal finds the way to her watchpoint [at the top of a tall blade of grass] with the help of only its skin’s general sensitivity to light. The approach of her prey becomes apparent to this blind and deaf bandit only through her sense of smell. The odor of butyric acid, which emanates from the sebaceous follicles of all mammals, works on the tick as a signal that causes her to abandon her post (on top of the blade of grass/bush) and fall blindly downward toward her prey. If she is fortunate enough to fall on something warm (which she perceives by means of an organ sensible to a precise temperature) then she has attained her prey, the warm-blooded animal, and thereafter needs only the help of her sense of touch to find the least hairy spot possible and embed herself up to her head in the cutaneous tissue of her prey. She can now slowly suck up a stream of warm blood."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, for the tick, the ''Umwelt'' is reduced to only three (biosemiotic) carriers of significance: (1) The [[odor]] of [[butyric acid]], which emanates from the [[sebaceous]] follicles of all [[mammals]], (2) The [[temperature]] of 37 degrees Celsius (corresponding to the [[blood]] of all mammals), (3) The hairiness of mammals.

==Theoretical biology==
{{Semiotics}}
von Uexküll anticipated many computer science ideas, particularly in the field of robotics, roughly 25 years before these things were invented.&lt;ref&gt;Lagerspetz, Kari Y. (2001): Jakob von Uexküll and the origins of cybernetics. ''Semiotica'' 134 (1/4): 643–651.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uexküll views organisms in terms of information processing. He argues every organism has an outer boundary which defines an '''Umwelt''' (German word generally meaning 'environment', 'surrounding world'). Rather than the general meaning, Uexküll's concept draws on the literal meaning of the German word, which is 'surround-world', to define the '''Umwelt''' as the subjectively perceived surroundings about which information is available to an organism through its senses.&lt;ref&gt;Chien, 2007, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a subjective ''weltanschauung'', or "world view", and is therefore fundamentally different from the [[black box]] concept, which is derived from the objective Newtonian viewpoint.

The organism has sensors that report the state of the ''Umwelt'' and effectors that can change parts of the ''Umwelt''. He distinguished the effector as the logical opposite of the sensor, or sense organ. Sensors and effectors are linked in a [[Feedback|feedback loop]]. Sensor input is processed by a ''Merkorgan'' and effectors are controlled by a ''Werkorgan''. The modern term 'sensorimotor' used in [[Enactivism|enactive theories of cognition]] encompasses these concepts.

He further distinguishes the ''Umgebung'' (that part of the ''Umwelt'' that represents distal features of the external world, in German 'that which is being given as surroundings') from the Innenwelt which is reported directly by sensors and is therefore the only unmediated reality immediately knowable to the organism. The relationship between the distal (mediated, transformed) features of the Umbegung and the proximal (untransformed, unmediated, primal) features of the Innenwelt must be learned by the organism in infancy. The nature of the Umbegung::Innenwelt relationship is relevant to the later theories of [[Embodied cognition]].

This is also similar to Kant's [[phenomenon]] and [[noumenon]] but derived logically from the properties of the sensors. What we now call a "feedback loop" he calls a "function-circle" and "circle" seems to be something like "system". He uses the term "melody" to mean something close to "algorithm". He coins around 75 technical terms, and a proper understanding of his book would require clearly defining them in modern terms and understanding their relations. He notices [[qualia]], comes close to object-oriented programming (page 98) uses the image of a helmsman which later showed up as "cybernetics" (page 291) and makes a good guess about DNA (page 127). He has a large number of ideas, although not expressed clearly in modern terms. His metaphysics is hyper-Kantian ("All reality is subjective appearance", page xv.) Space is a set of direction symbols. He rejects Darwin and says nothing of God. Organisms are based on something called "Plan", the origin of which we cannot know.

Uexküll was an advocate of [[non-Darwinian evolution]] and critic of Darwinism.&lt;ref&gt;Kreitler, Shulamith. (2013). ''Cognition and Motivation: Forging an Interdisciplinary Perspective''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 185-186. {{ISBN|978-0-521-88867-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kalevi Kull]] noted that "despite his opposition to Darwinism, Uexküll was not anti-evolutionist".&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Brett. (2008). ''Onto-ethologies : The Animal Environments of Uexküll, Heidegger, Merleau-ponty, and Deleuze''. SUNY Press. p. 18. {{ISBN|978-0-7914-7611-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
Works by scholars such as [[Kalevi Kull]] connect Uexküll's studies with some areas of [[philosophy]] such as [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[hermeneutics]]. Jakob von Uexküll is also considered a pioneer of [[Semiotics|semiotic]] biology, or [[biosemiotics]]. However, despite his influence (on the work of philosophers [[Max Scheler]],   [[Ernst Cassirer]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Humberto Maturana]], [[Georges Canguilhem]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] (in their ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]''), for example) he is still not widely known, and his books are mostly out of print in German and in English. A paperback French translation of ''Streifzüge durch die Umwelten von Tieren und Menschen'' [A stroll through the Umwelten of animals and humans] of 1934 is currently in print.  This book has been translated in English as ''A Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans, with A Theory of Meaning'' by Jakob von Uexküll, translated by Joseph D. O'Neil, introduction by Dorion Sagan, University of Minnesota Press, 2011. The other available book is "Theoretical Biology", a reprint of the 1926 translation of "Theoretische Biologie" (1920). "Foray" is a popular introduction while "Theoretical Biology" is intended for an academic audience.

== Family ==
His sons were the physician [[Thure von Uexküll]] and journalist Gösta von Uexküll. His daughter was Sophie Luise Damajanti von Uexküll ('Dana'). His grandson is the writer [[Jakob von Uexkull]].

==In popular culture==
Uexküll's ideas about how organisms create their own concept of time are described in [[Peter Høeg|Peter Høeg's]] novel ''[[Borderliners]]'', and contrasted with [[Isaac Newton|Isaac Newton's]] view of time as something that exists independent of life.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Høeg, ''Borderliners'', trans. Barbara Haveland (The Harvill Press, 1995), pp. 214–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Languaculture''' is a term meaning that a [[language]] includes not only elements such as grammar and vocabulary, but also past knowledge, local and cultural information, habits and behaviours. The term was created by the American anthropologist [[Michael Agar]].

==Meaning==
Agar used the term "languaculture" for the first time in his essay ''Language Shock: Understanding the culture of conversation''. Languaculture is an adjustment of the term "linguaculture", suggested by the American [[linguistic anthropologist]] Paul Friedrich. Agar explains the [[vowel change]] stating that language is a more commonly used word.

When Agar talks about languaculture, he defines it as the necessary tie between language and [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Agar, Michael,|year=1995|title=''[[Language Shock: Understanding the culture of conversation]]''|location=New York|publisher=William Morrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; He underlines that languages and cultures are always closely related and it is not possible to distinguish languages from cultures. Therefore, you cannot really know a language if you do not know also the culture expressed by that language.

The notion of culture and its understanding involve the link between two different languacultures that Agar define LC1 (source languaculture) and LC2 (target languaculture).

==Rich points==
{{Inappropriate person|section|date=August 2016}}The learning of target languaculture is driven by "rich points". We realize that a culture is different from ours when we face some behaviours which we do not understand. Rich points are those surprises, those departures from an outsider’s expectations that signal a difference between source languaculture and target languaculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agar, Michael|title=Culture: Can You Take It Anywhere?|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Methods|year=2006|volume=5|issue=2|article=XX}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the moments of incomprehension, when you suddenly do not know what is happening. In this situation different reactions are possible. You can ignore the rich point and hope that the next part makes sense. You can perceive it as evidence that the person who produced it has some lacks. Or you can wonder why you do not understand and if maybe some other languaculture comes into play. Therefore, rich points belong to daily life and not only to language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Agar, Michael,|year=1995|title=Language Shock: Understanding the culture of conversation | location=New York|publisher=William Morrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agar highlights that the term ''rich'' has the positive connotations of thickness, wealth and abundance. The largest rich point is the total incomprehension due to huge differences between source languaculture and target languaculture. In this case we are facing a ‘culture shock’ that causes a deep bewilderment. The smallest rich point can occur among different groups of the same community.
The existence of rich points comes from the fact that every statement implicitly refers to various elements that are taken for granted in a certain culture and do not match the elements of another culture (cultural implicitness).

==Culture in languaculture==
According to Agar, culture is a construction, a translation between source languaculture and target languaculture. Like a [[translation]], it makes no sense to talk about the culture of X without saying the culture of X for Y, taking into account the standpoint from which it is observed. For this reason culture is relational.
Moreover, culture is always plural. No person or group can be described, explained or generalized completely with a single cultural label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agar, Michael|title=Culture: Can You Take It Anywhere?|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Methods|year=2006|volume=5|issue=2|article=XX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-Instrumental Movement Inhibition''' (NIMI) is a psychological phenomenon; it is a form of [[Embodied cognition|embodied]] behavior, where the body reveals the thoughts and emotions in a person's mind. During NIMI, visual engagement or [[attention]] leads subconsciously to lower levels of [[fidgeting]] (and other non-instrumental movements).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Witchel|first=Harry|last2=Westling|first2=Carina|last3=Tee|first3=Julian|last4=Healy|first4=Aoife|last5=Needham|first5=Rob|last6=Chockalingam|first6=Nachiappan|date=2014|title=What does not happen: Quantifying embodied engagement using NIMI and self-adaptors|url=http://www.participations.org/Volume%2011/Issue%201/18.pdf|journal=Participations: Journal of Audience and Reception Studies|volume=11 |issue=1|pages=304–331|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-Instrumental movements are bodily actions that are not related to the goal of the current task; for example, when in a classroom and the goal is to listen to a lecture, non-instrument (unnecessary) movements include fidgeting, scratching, postural micromovements, and certain emotional expressions.

The original observation that, in a seated audience, interest is associated with diminished fidgeting, and that [[boredom]] doubles the amount of human movement, was made by [[Francis Galton]] in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galton|first=Francis|date=1885-06-25|title=The Measure of Fidget|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/032174b0|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=32|issue=817|pages=174–175|doi=10.1038/032174b0|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern experiments suggesting that movement inhibition (and NIMI) were quantifiable and related to [[Flow (psychology)|flow]] or interest were suggested by a series of papers regarding automated tutoring systems by Sidney D’Mello and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D'Mello|first=Sidney|last2=Chipman|first2=Patrick|last3=Grasesser|first3=Art|date=2007|title=Posture as a predictor of learner’s affective engagement|url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt7hs9v2hr/qt7hs9v2hr.pdf|journal=Proceedings Of The 29th Annual Cognitive Science Society|publisher=Cognitive Science Society|volume=|pages=905–910|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using a non-visual task, Paul Seli and collaborators showed that increased episodes of [[Mind-wandering|mind wandering]] led to an increase in fidgeting, presumably because attention requires comparative stillness (maintaining that stillness is described as “a secondary task”).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seli|first=Paul|last2=Carriere|first2=Jonathan S.

== Controversy ==
While it is known that [[frustration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kapoor|first=Ashish|last2=Burleson|first2=Winslow|last3=Picard|first3=Rosalind W.|date=August 2007|title=Automatic Prediction of Frustration|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2007.02.003|journal=Int.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4403">'''Oil purification''' ([[Transformer oil|transformer]], turbine, industrial, etc.) removes oil contaminants in order to prolong oil service life.
==Contaminants of industrial oils==
'''Contaminants''' and '''various impurities''' get into industrial oils during storage and operation. The most common contaminants are &lt;ref name="Hydraulic oil filtration"&gt;Hydraulic oil filtration.  A Publication of the Lubrication Engineers Technical Department. Number 62.&lt;/ref&gt;:
* water;
* solid particles;
* gases;
* asphalt-resinous paraffin deposits;
* acids;
* oil sludge;
* organometallic compounds;
* unsaturated hydrocarbons;
* polyaromatic hydrocarbons;
* additive  remains;
* products of oil decomposition.
==Methods of oil purification==
'''Industrial oils''' are purified through sedimentation, filtration, centrifugation, vacuum treatment and adsorption purification &lt;ref name="Study of Transformer Oil Purification"&gt;[http://www.internationaljournalssrg.org/IJEEE/2017/Volume4-Issue3/IJEEE-V4I3P105.pdf Shreya Salvi, A. P. Paranjape (March 2017). Study of Transformer Oil Purification. SSRG International Journal of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (SSRG-IJEEE). volume 4 Issue 3. pp. 20-23.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Purification of transformer oil "&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309404071_PURIFICATION_OF_TRANSFORMER_OIL_in_PT_PJB_UP_PAITON Gusti Wahdaniyah, Purnomo Tri Prasetyo, Arif Setiabudi, Totok R. Biyanto (July 2016). Purification of transformer oil in PT. PJB. UP PAITON. International journal of engineering science. Number 5(7). pp. 91 -94.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[  Sedimentation|  Sedimentation]] is precipitation of solid particles and water to the bottom of oil tanks under gravity. The main drawback of this process is its longevity &lt;ref name="Waste Oil Recovery"&gt;[https://www.ijirset.com/upload/2016/november/62_26_COMPARSION.pdf Z.K. Bhushan, S.M. Anil, K. Sainand, H. Shivkumar (November 2016). Comparison between Different Methods of Waste Oil Recovery. International Journal of Innovative Research in Science, Engineering and Technology.Vol.5, Issue 11. pp. 20001-20009.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[ Filtration| Filtration]] is a partial removal of solid particles through filter medium. Oil filtration systems generally use a multistage filtration with coarse and fine filters &lt;ref name="Classic Ways of Used Oil Purification"&gt;[https://oilregeneration.globecore.com/classic-ways-of-used-oil-purification Classic Ways of Used Oil Purification.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Centrifugation|Centrifugation]] is separation of oil and water, or oil and solid particles by centrifugal forces.

Vacuum treatment degasses and dehydrates industrial oil. This method is well suited for removing dispersed and dissolved water, as well as dissolved gases &lt;ref name="Vacuum Distillation Technique"&gt;[http://jnus.org/pdf/1/2017/1/1257.pdf M.M. Khudhair, T. M. Hameed, H.A. Alameer (June 2017). Using Vacuum Distillation Technique to Treat Waste Lubricating Oil and Evaluation its Efficiency by Chromatographic Methods. Journal of Al-Nahrain University. Volume 20(2). pp. 17-24.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Adsorption| Adsorption purification]], in contrast to the methods mentioned above, does not remove solid particles and gases, but it shows good results at removing water, oil sludge and aging products. This process uses adsorbents of natural or artificial origin:  bleaching clays, synthetic aluminosilicates, silica gels, zeolites, etc &lt;ref name="Waste Lubricating Oil Treatment"&gt;[https://www.idc-online.com/technical_references/pdfs/chemical_engineering/Waste%20Lubricating.pdf N.M. Abdel-Jabbar, Essam A.H. Al Zubaidy, M. Mehrvar (2010). Waste Lubricating Oil Treatment by Adsorption Process Using Different Adsorbents. International Journal of Chemical and Biological Engineering. Volume 3. pp. 70-73.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==The difference between purification and regeneration of industrial oil==
Often the terms '''"oil purification"''' and '''"[[Oil regeneration|  oil regeneration]]"''' are used synonymously. Although in fact they are not the same. Oil purification cleans oil from contaminants. it can be used independently or as a part of oil regeneration. Oil regeneration also removes aging products (with the help of adsorbents) and stabilizes oil with additives. Regenerated oil is clean from carcinogenic products of oil aging and stabilized with the help of additives.

'''Overall equipment effectiveness''' ('''OEE''') is a term coined by [[Seiichi Nakajima]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Origin of OEE|url=http://www.oeefoundation.org/origin-of-oee/|website=OEE Foundation|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s to evaluate how effectively a [[manufacturing]] operation is utilized.  It is based on the [[Harrington Emerson]] way of thinking regarding labor efficiency.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The results are stated in a generic form which allows comparison between manufacturing units in differing industries. It is not however an absolute measure and is best used to identify scope for process performance improvement, and how to get the improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding OEE|url=http://www.ofsystems.com/understanding-oee|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; If for example the [[cycle time]] is reduced, the OEE will increase i.e. more product is produced for less resource. Another example is if one enterprise serves a high volume, low variety market, and another enterprise serves a low volume, high variety market. More [[changeover]]s (set-ups) will lower the OEE in comparison, but if the product is sold at a premium, there could be more margin with a lower OEE.

OEE measurement is also commonly used as a [[key performance indicator]] (KPI) in conjunction with [[lean manufacturing]] efforts to provide an indicator of success. OEE can be illustrated by a brief discussion of the six metrics that comprise the system. The hierarchy consists of two top-level measures and four underlying measures.

== Top-level metrics ==
Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) and '''total effective equipment performance''' (TEEP) are two closely related metrics that report the overall utilization of facilities, time and material for manufacturing operations. These top view metrics directly indicate the gap between actual and ideal performance.

* Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) quantifies how well a manufacturing unit performs relative to its designed capacity, during the periods when it is scheduled to run.
* [[Total effective equipment performance]] (TEEP) measures OEE against calendar hours, i.e.: 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.

== Underlying metrics ==
In addition to the above measures, there are four underlying metrics that provide understanding as to why and where the OEE and TEEP gaps exist.

The measurements are described below

*''' [[Task loading|Loading]]:''' The portion of the TEEP Metric that represents the percentage of total calendar time that is actually scheduled for operation.
*''' [[Availability]]:''' The portion of the OEE Metric that represents the percentage of scheduled time that the operation is available to operate. Often referred to as Uptime.
*''' Performance:''' The portion of the OEE Metric that represents the speed at which the Work Center runs as a percentage of its designed speed.
*''' [[Quality (business)|Quality]]:''' The portion of the OEE Metric that represents the Good Units produced as a percentage of the Total Units Started. It is commonly referred to as the [[first pass yield]] (FPY).

== Calculations for OEE and TEEP ==
What follows is a detailed presentation of each of the six OEE / TEEP Metrics and examples of how to perform calculations. The calculations are not particularly complicated, but care must be taken as to standards that are used as the basis. Additionally, these calculations are valid at the work center or part number level but become more complicated if rolling down to aggregate levels.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://capstonemetrics.com/files/whitepaper-oeeoverview.pdf | title = OEE Overview - with Calculation Methods |accessdate = 23 Sep 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overall equipment effectiveness ===
OEE breaks the performance of a manufacturing unit into three separate but measurable components:  [[Availability]], Performance, and [[Quality (business)|Quality]]. Each component points to an aspect of the process that can be targeted for improvement. OEE may be applied to any individual Work Center, or rolled up to Department or Plant levels. This tool also allows for drilling down for very specific analysis, such as a particular Part Number, Shift, or any of several other parameters.
It is unlikely that any manufacturing process can run at 100% OEE. Many manufacturers benchmark their industry to set a challenging target; 85% is not uncommon.
*OEE is calculated with the formula (Availability)*(Performance)*(Quality)

*Using the examples given below:
*(Availability= 86.6%)*(Performance=93%)*(Quality=91.3%)= (OEE=73.6%)
Alternatively, and often easier, OEE is calculated by dividing the minimum time needed to produce the parts under optimal conditions by the actual time needed to produce the parts. For example:
*Total Time: 8 hour shift or 28,800 seconds, producing 14,400 parts, or one part every 2 seconds.
*Fastest possible cycle time is 1.5 seconds, hence only 21,600 seconds would have been needed to produce the 14,400 parts. The remaining 7,200 seconds or 2 hours were lost.
*The OEE is now the 21,600 seconds divided by 28,800 seconds (same as minimal 1.5 seconds per part divided by 2 actual seconds per part), or 75%.

=== Total effective equipment performance ===
Where OEE measures effectiveness based on scheduled hours, TEEP measures effectiveness against calendar hours, i.e.: 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.

TEEP, therefore, reports the 'bottom line' utilization of assets.

TEEP = Loading * OEE&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Loading===
The Loading portion of the TEEP Metric represents the percentage of time that an operation is scheduled to operate compared to the total Calendar Time that is available. The Loading Metric is a pure measurement of Schedule Effectiveness and is designed to exclude the effects how well that operation may perform.

'''Calculation: Loading = Scheduled Time / Calendar Time'''

''Example:''

A given Work Center is scheduled to run 5 Days per Week, 24 Hours per Day.

For a given week, the Total Calendar Time is 7 Days at 24 Hours.

Loading  = (5 days x 24 hours) / (7 days x 24 hours) = 71.4%

===Availability===
The Availability portion of the OEE Metric represents the percentage of scheduled time that the operation is available to operate. The Availability Metric is a pure measurement of Uptime that is designed to exclude the effects of Quality and Performance. The losses due to wasted availability are called ''availability losses''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ofsystems.com/#!understanding-oee/c1mpi | title = Understanding Availability |accessdate = 9 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Example:''
A given Work Center is scheduled to run for an 8-hour (480 minute) shift with a 30-minute scheduled break and during the break the lines stop, and unscheduled downtime is 60 minutes.

The scheduled time = 480 minutes - 30 minutes = 450 minutes.

Operating Time = 480 Minutes – 30 Minutes Scheduled Downtime – 60 Minutes Unscheduled Downtime = 390 Minutes

'''Calculation: Availability = operating time / scheduled time'''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Availability = 390 minutes / 450 minutes = 86.6%

===Performance and productivity===
Also known as "process rate", the Performance portion of the OEE Metric represents the speed at which the Work Center runs as a percentage of its designed speed. The Performance Metric is a pure measurement of speed that is designed to exclude the effects of Quality and Availability. The losses due to wasted performance are also often called ''speed losses''. In practice it is often difficult to determine speed losses, and a common approach is to merely assign the remaining unknown losses as speed losses.

'''Calculation: Performance ([[Productivity]]) = (Parts Produced * Ideal Cycle Time) / Operating time''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oee.com/calculating-oee.html | title = OEE Primer: Calculating OEE |accessdate = 9 Jul 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Example:''

A given Work Center is scheduled to run for an 8-hour (480 minute) shift with a 30-minute scheduled break.

Operating Time = 450 Min Scheduled – 60 Min Unscheduled Downtime = 390 Minutes

The Standard Rate for the part being produced is 40 Units/Hour or 1.5 Minutes/Unit

The Work Center produces 242 Total Units during the shift. Note: The basis is Total Units, not Good Units. The Performance metric does not penalize for Quality.

Time to Produce Parts = 242 Units * 1.5 Minutes/Unit  = 363 Minutes

Performance (Productivity)  = 363 Minutes / 390 Minutes = 93.1%

===Quality===
The Quality portion of the OEE Metric represents the Good Units produced as a percentage of the Total Units Started. The Quality Metric is a pure measurement of Process Yield that is designed to exclude the effects of Availability and Performance. The losses due to defects and rework are called ''quality losses''.

'''Calculation: Quality = (Units produced - defective units) / (Units produced)'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sensrtrx.com/calculate-oee/|title=Calculate OEE - Simple Calculator &amp; OEE Formulas|newspaper=SensrTrx {{!}} Cloud Manufacturing Analytics|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Example:''

242 Units are produced. 21 are defective.

(242 units produced - 21 defective units) = 221 units

221 good units / 242 total units produced = 91.32%

== "Six Big Losses" ==
[[File:OEE SixLoss Calculation Example.png|thumb|Example of OEE and Six Loss calculation]]
To be able to better determine what is contributing to the greatest loss and so what areas should be targeted to improve the performance, these categories (Availability, Performance and Quality) have been subdivided further into what is known as the ‘Six Big Losses’ to OEE.

These are categorized as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Availability!! Performance!! Quality
|-
| Planned Downtime || Minor Stops || Production Rejects
|-
| Breakdowns || Speed Loss || Rejects on Start up
|-
|}

The reason for identifying the losses in these categories is so that specific countermeasures can be applied to reduce the loss and improve the overall OEE.

== Heuristic ==
OEE is useful as a [[heuristic]], but can break down in several circumstances.  For example, it may be far more costly to
run a facility at certain times.  Performance and quality may not be independent of each other or of availability and loading.
Experience may develop over time. Since the performance of shop floor managers is at least sometimes compared to the OEE, these numbers are often not reliable, and there are numerous ways to fudge these numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allaboutlean.com/fudge-oee | title = Top Three Methods on how to Fudge Your OEE|accessdate = 5 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OEE has properties of a [[geometric mean]].  As such it punishes [[Statistical variability|variability]] among its subcomponents.  For example, 20% * 80% = 16%,
whereas 50% * 50% = 25%.  When there are asymmetric costs associated with one or more of the components, then the model may become less appropriate.

Consider a system where the cost of error is exceptionally high. In such a condition, higher quality may be far more important
in a proper evaluation of [[effectiveness]] than performance or availability. OEE also to some extent assumes a closed system and a potentially static one. If one can bring in additional resources (or lease out unused resources to other projects or business units) then it may be more appropriate for example to use an expected [[net present value]] analysis.

Variability in flow can also introduce important costs and [[risk]]s that may merit further modeling. [[Sensitivity analysis]] and measures of change may be helpful.

КЕЭ, том 9, кол. 1188–1198]&lt;/ref&gt; was mostly forbidden. Most Jews were still excluded from residency in a number of cities within the Pale as well. A limited number of Jews were allowed to live outside the area, including those with university education, the ennobled, members of the most affluent of the merchant guilds and particular [[artisan]]s, some military personnel and some services associated with them, including their families, and sometimes the servants of these. The archaic English term ''pale'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''{{lang|la|[[:wikt:palus#Latin|palus]]}}'', a stake, extended to mean the area enclosed by a fence or boundary.&lt;ref&gt;"pale, n.1." ''OED Online''. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Retrieved October 24, 2016. [[The Pale]] was the part of medieval [[Ireland]] controlled by the English government.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pale of Settlement included all of [[Belarus]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Moldova]], much of present-day [[Ukraine]], parts of eastern [[Latvia]], eastern [[Poland]], and some parts of western [[Russia]], roughly corresponding to the [[Kresy]] macroregion and modern-day western border of Russia. It extended from the eastern ''pale'', or demarcation line, to the Russian border with the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (later the [[German Empire]]) and the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Furthermore, it comprised about 20% of the territory of European Russia and largely corresponded to historical lands of the former [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Cossack Hetmanate]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]] (with [[Crimean Khanate]]).

The Russian Empire in the period of the existence of the Pale was predominantly [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]]. The area included in the Pale, with its large Jewish, [[Uniate]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] populations, was acquired through a series of military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers, between 1654 and 1815. While the religious nature of the edicts creating the Pale are clear (conversion to [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]], the state religion, released individuals from the strictures), historians argue that the motivations for its creation and maintenance were primarily economic and [[nationalist]]ic in nature.

The end of the enforcement and formal demarcation of the Pale coincided with the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]], and ultimately with the [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution]]s of 1917, i.e., the fall of the Russian Empire.

The Pale was first created by [[Catherine the Great]] in 1791, after several failed attempts by her predecessors, notably the [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]], to remove Jews from Russia entirely,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people = Producer,  director, production company unknown |date= October 24, 2011 |year= |title= История России, 7.

The institution of the Pale became more significant following the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793, since, until then, Russia's Jewish population had been rather limited;{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} the dramatic westward expansion of the Russian Empire through the annexation of Polish-Lithuanian territory substantially increased the Jewish population.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} At its height, the Pale, including the new Polish and Lithuanian territories, had a Jewish population of over five million, and represented the largest component (40 percent) of the world Jewish population at that time.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

From 1791 to 1835, and until 1917, there were differing reconfigurations of the boundaries of the Pale, such that certain areas were variously open or shut to Jewish residency, such as the [[Caucasus]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} At times, Jews were forbidden to live in agricultural communities, or certain cities, (as in [[Kiev]], [[Sevastopol]] and [[Yalta]]), and were forced to move to small provincial towns, thus fostering the rise of the ''[[shtetl]]s.''{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Jewish merchants of the First Guild ({{lang|ru|купцы первой гильдии}}, the wealthiest ''[[sosloviye]]'' of merchants in the Russian Empire), people with higher or special education, University students, [[artisan]]s, army tailors, ennobled Jews, soldiers (drafted in accordance with the Recruit Charter of 1810), and their families had the right to live outside the Pale of Settlement.&lt;ref name="jewishfamilysearch.com"&gt;{{cite web | author = Jankowski, Tomasz [attr.] | date = May 3, 2014 | title= Who could live outside the Pale of Settlement? |  url=http://jewishfamilysearch.com/pale-of-settlement/ | format = blogpost | work=JewishFamilySearch.com | access-date=September 29, 2016 | quote = [Presents 14 groups of Jews to whom permission might be granted to live outside of the Pale, indicating additional conditions, and presenting three reasons for temporary permissions to leave, for the 13 governates of the Russian Empire; the bogpost is by an academic historian, and states: 'These rules was regulated by the Law on Social Estates and the Law on Passports printed in vol. 9 and 14 of Свод законов Российской империи.']}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2016}} In some periods, special dispensations were given for Jews to live in the major imperial cities, but these were tenuous, and several thousand Jews were expelled to the Pale from [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Moscow]] as late as 1891.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

During World War I, the Pale lost its rigid hold on the Jewish population when large numbers of Jews fled into the Russian interior to escape the invading German army.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} On March 20 (April 2 [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|N.S.]]), 1917, the Pale was abolished by the [[Russian Provisional Government, 1917|Provisional Government]] [[decree]], ''On abolition of confessional and national restrictions'' ({{lang-ru|Об отмене вероисповедных и национальных ограничений}}).{{cn | date=March 2016}}  A large portion of the Pale, together with its Jewish population, [[history of the Jews in Poland|became part of Poland]].{{cn | date=March 2016}} Subsequently, most of this population would perish in [[The Holocaust]] one generation later.

Jewish life in the [[shtetl]]s ({{lang-yi|שטעטלעך}} ''{{transl|yi|shtetlekh}}'' "little towns") of the Pale of Settlement was hard and poverty-stricken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0018_0_18416.html |title=Shtetl |work=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]], The Gale Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Jewish religious tradition of ''[[tzedakah]]'' (charity), a sophisticated system of volunteer Jewish [[social welfare]] organizations developed to meet the needs of the population. Various organizations supplied clothes to poor students, provided [[kosher]] food to Jewish soldiers conscripted into the [[Imperial Russian Army|Tsar's army]], dispensed free medical treatment for the poor, offered dowries and household gifts to destitute brides, and arranged for technical education for orphans. According to historian Martin Gilbert's ''Atlas of Jewish History'', no province in the Pale had less than 14% of Jews on relief; Lithuanian and Ukrainian Jews supported as much as 22% of their poor populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aish.com/jl/h/48956361.html|title=History Crash Course #56: Pale of Settlement|author=Rabbi Ken Spiro|date=|work=aish.com|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concentration of Jews in the Pale, coupled with Tzar Alexander III's "fierce hatred of the Jews", and the rumors that Jews had been involved in the assassination of his father [[Tzar Alexander II]] made them easy targets for [[pogrom]]s and anti-Jewish riots by the majority population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Romanovs -- 1613 to 1918|last=Montifiore|first=Simon Sebag|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=463–464}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These, along with the repressive [[May Laws]], often devastated whole communities.{{cn|date=September 2016}} Though attacks occurred throughout the existence of the Pale, particularly devastating [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|anti-Jewish pogroms]] occurred from 1881–83 and from 1903–1906,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Modern Jewish History: Pogroms |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/pogroms.html |work=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]], The Gale Group |date=2008 |accessdate=19 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; targeting hundreds of communities, assaulting thousands of Jews, and causing considerable property damage.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

One outgrowth of the concentration of Jews in a circumscribed area was the development of the modern [[yeshiva]] system.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Until the beginning of the 19th century, each town supported its own advanced students who learned in the local [[synagogue]] with the rabbinical head of the community. Each student would eat his meals in a different home each day, a system known as ''{{lang|yi|essen teg}}'' ("eating days").{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

After 1886, the [[Jewish quota]] was applied to education, with the percentage of Jewish students limited to no more than 10% within the Pale, 5% outside the Pale and 3% in the capitals of Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Kiev.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The quotas in the capitals, however, were increased slightly in 1908 and 1915.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Amidst the difficult conditions in which the Jewish population lived and worked, the courts of [[Hasidism|Hasidic]] dynasties flourished in the Pale.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Thousands of followers of [[rebbe]]s such as the Gerrer Rebbe [[Yehudah Aryeh Leib Alter]] (known as the ''Sfas Emes''), the Chernobyler Rebbe, and the Vizhnitzer Rebbe flocked to their towns for the [[Jewish holiday]]s and followed their rebbes' ''[[minhag]]im'' (Jewish practices) in their own homes.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The tribulations of Jewish life in the Pale of Settlement were immortalized in the writings of [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] authors such as humorist [[Sholom Aleichem]], whose novel ''{{lang|yi|Tevye der Milchiger}}'' (Tevye the Milkman) (in the form of the narration of [[Tevye]] from a fictional shtetl of Anatevka to the author) form the basis of the theatrical (and subsequent film) production ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Because of the harsh conditions of day-to-day life in the Pale, some two million Jews emigrated from there between 1881 and 1914, [[History of the Jews in the United States|mainly to the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie S. Landau (1992) ''The Nazi Holocaust''. IB Tauris, London and New York: 57&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pattern-of-life analysis''' is a method of [[surveillance]] specifically used for documenting or understanding a subject's (or many subjects') habits. This information can then potentially be used to predict future actions by the subject(s) being observed. This form of observation can, and is, generally done without the consent of the subject, with motives including but not limited to [[Signals intelligence|security]], [[normal profit|profit]], scientific research, regular censuses, and [[traffic analysis]]. Unlike these specific areas of surveillance, pattern-of-life analysis is not limited to one medium and can encompass anything in an individual's (or system of individuals') life from their internet browsing habits, to a record of instances of choices made in order to determine a statistical 'favorite'.

== Notable examples ==

=== Wide-Area Motion Imagery ===

[[Wide-Area Motion Imagery (WAMI)|Wide-area motion imagery (WAMI)]] generates high-resolution images to enable tracking and recording of vehicle and pedestrian movements over city-sized areas. Pattern of life (POL) or behavior pattern describes a recurrent (e.g., normalcy) way of acting by an individual or group toward a given object or in a given situation. Usually, one has a specific POL, and this POL is repeatable. Using full motion video or WAMI data with extracted tracks can be used for POL analysis.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pattern of Life from WAMI Objects Tracking based on Context-Aware Tracking and Information Network Models|url=http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1691331|accessdate=23 May 2013|last1= Gao|first1= J.|last2= Ling|first2= Haibin|last3= Blasch|first3= Erik|last4= Pham|first4= Khanh|last5= Wang|first5= Zhonghai|last6= Chen|first6= Genshe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Context-aware tracking with wide-area motion imagery

=== Esri's use of ArcGIS ===
Esri is an international supplier of [[Geographic Information System]] (GIS) software, web GIS and [[geodatabase]] management applications. Esri uses the name [[ArcGIS]] to refer to its suite of GIS software products, which operate on desktop, server, and mobile platforms. The term GIS describes any [[information]] system that integrates, stores, edits, analyzes, shares and displays geographic information for informing [[decision making]]. With this technology, the company's goal is to unify information of a subject's life habits and their geographical whereabouts with statistics related to [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] casualties in an effort to predict and prevent another IED incident from happening. In one presentation used at an Esri Federal User Conference, it states: "Exploitation of a cell's network enables a commander with the right tools to get 'Left of Boom' [i.e. before an IED or bomb detonates]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using ArcGIS for Intelligence Analysis|url=http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/feduc11/papers/tech/feduc-using-arcgis-for-intelligence-analysis.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2014|last1= Mason|first1= Tony|last2= Foss|first2= Suzanne|last3= Lam|first3= Vinh|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MARINA ===
MARINA is an NSA database and analysis toolset for intercepted Internet metadata (DNI in NSA terminology). The database stores metadata up to a year. According to documents leaked by Edward Snowden: "The Marina metadata application tracks a user's browser experience, gathers contact information/content and develops summaries of target" and "[o]f the more distinguishing features, Marina has the ability to look back on the last 365 days' worth of DNI metadata seen by the Sigint collection system, regardless whether or not it was tasked for collection." [Emphasis in original NSA document.] The stored metadata is mainly used for pattern-of-life analysis. US persons are not exempt because metadata is not considered data by US law (section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act). {{fact|date=July 2017}}

MARINA's phone counterpart is MAINWAY.

'''''Pawn Stars Australia''''' is the Australian adaption of the [[Pawn Stars|American series of the same name]]. It premiered on 21 July 2015 on [[A&amp;E Australia|A&amp;E]].&lt;ref name="series details"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hansen|first1=Nick|title=Bondi's Happy Hockers in Pawn Stars Australian spin-off|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/city-east/bondis-happy-hockers-in-pawn-stars-australian-spin-off/story-fngr8h22-1227444676066|accessdate=20 July 2015|work=Wentworth Courier|date=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian version is the third international spin-off after [[Pawn Stars UK]] and Pawn Stars South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hogan|first1=Matthew|title=Sydney trio into hardcore pawn|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305135237/https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/28827861/sydney-trio-into-hardcore-pawn/|accessdate=20 July 2015|work=[[The West Australian]]|date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series stars brothers Aaron and Ben Senes along with their childhood mate Shanon Folden, who own the well-known chain of pawn stores called ''Happy Hockers'' in [[Sydney]].&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blundell|first1=Graeme|title=Reality TV show Pawn Stars Australia is a big deal|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/reality-tv-show-pawn-stars-australia-is-a-big-deal/story-fn9n8gph-1227435498997|accessdate=20 July 2015|work=[[The Australian]]|date=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The series is directed by Martin Baker and produced by Leftfield Pictures, the same company that produces the American original.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;

The complete first season DVD was scheduled to be released on 5 October 2016.

==Development and production==
In April 2014 it was reported that a local adaption of ''Pawn Stars'' was in the works, with filming starting at Sydney's ''Happy Hockers'' which would last 9 weeks. It was believed an official announcement of a late 2014 premiere on A&amp;E would come in the following days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Auerbach|first=Taylor|title=The Pawn Stars of Bondi Beach: Hit American hock show hits Australia starring brothers 'Baz and Shaz'|newspaper=Daily Mail Australia|date=4 April 2014|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2596556/Aussie-Pawn-Stars-coming-Hit-American-hock-filming-Australian-spinoff-Bondi-Beach-pawn-shop.html|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it wasn't until August 2014 that the series had officially been commissioned, and that Leftfield Pictures (the company behind ''Pawn Stars U.S.'') were officially confirmed as the producers of the local adaption. It was also stated that the series would air in 2015, rather than in 2014 as previously rumoured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[TV Tonight]]|first=David|last=Knox|title=Pawn Stars Australia coming to A&amp;E|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2014/08/pawn-stars-australia-coming-to-ae.html|accessdate=22 July 2015|date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015 it was announced the series would officially star brothers Aaron and Ben Senes and best friend Shanon Folden and would premiere on 21 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[TV Tonight]]|first=David|last=Knox|title=Airdate: Pawn Stars Australia|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2015/06/airdate-pawn-stars-australia.html|accessdate=22 July 2015|date=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senes brother said they agreed to do the reality series to help the public know about the pawn industry, which they said is misunderstood. "People can see it's a legitimate operation where we do everything by the book and we have a successful business to prove it", Ben Senes said.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt; The brothers have been in the business for 22 years. Selling jewellery and electronics is the "bread-and-butter" of their business but people also bring in highly unusual items. Through the years they have seen everything from monkey testicles, to gold teeth fillings to rare collectibles such as a vintage red telephone box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Molloy|first1=Shannon|title=From monkey testicles to gold tooth fillings, these are the weird things people try to pawn|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/entertainment/television/from-monkey-testicles-to-gold-tooth-fillings-these-are-the-weird-things-people-try-to-pawn/story-fnhoh21a-1227441647844|accessdate=20 July 2015|work=Perth Now|date=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''Happy Hockers'' operates 5 stores across Sydney, the series is filmed almost entirely at their [[Bondi Beach]] store.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12495">'''Pocket set theory''' ('''PST''') is an [[alternative set theory]] in which there are only two infinite [[cardinal number]]s, ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ([[aleph-naught]], the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers) and ''c'' (the [[cardinality of the continuum]]). The theory was first suggested by [[Rudy Rucker]] in his ''Infinity and the Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;Rucker, Rudy, ''Infinity of the Mind'', Princeton UP, 1995, p.253.&lt;/ref&gt; The details set out in this entry are due to the American mathematician Randall M. Holmes.

== Arguments supporting PST ==
There are at least two independent arguments in favor of a small set theory like '''PST'''.
#One can get the impression from mathematical practice outside set theory that there are “only two infinite cardinals which demonstrably ‘occur in nature’ (the cardinality of the natural numbers and the cardinality of the continuum),”&lt;ref&gt;''Pocket Set Theory'', p.8.{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore “set theory produces far more superstructure than is needed to support classical mathematics.”&lt;ref&gt;''Alternative Set Theories'', p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it may be an exaggeration (one can get into a situation in which one has to talk about arbitrary sets of real numbers or real functions), with some technical tricks&lt;ref&gt;See ''Pocket Set Theory'', p.8. on encoding.&lt;/ref&gt; a considerable portion of mathematics can be reconstructed within '''PST'''; certainly enough for most of its practical applications.
#A second argument arises from [[Foundations of mathematics|foundational]] considerations. Most of mathematics can be [[Implementation of mathematics in set theory|implemented]] in [[Axiomatic set theory|standard set theory]] or one of its large alternatives. Set theories, on the other hand, are introduced in terms of a logical system; in most cases it is [[first-order logic]]. The syntax and semantics of first-order logic, on the other hand, is built on set-theoretical grounds. Thus, there is a foundational circularity, which forces us to choose as weak a theory as possible for [[bootstrapping]]. This line of thought, again, leads to small set theories.
Thus, there are reasons to think that Cantor's infinite hierarchy of the infinites is superfluous. Pocket set theory is a “minimalistic” set theory that allows for only two infinites: the [[Aleph number#Aleph-null|cardinality &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;]] of the (standard) natural numbers and the [[Cardinality of the continuum|cardinality &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{2^{\aleph_0}}&lt;/math&gt;]] of the (standard) reals.

== The theory ==

'''PST''' uses standard first-order language with identity and the binary relation symbol &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \in }&lt;/math&gt;. Ordinary variables are upper case ''X'', ''Y'', etc. In the intended interpretation, the variables these stand for [[Class (set theory)|classes]], and the atomic formula &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ X \in Y }&lt;/math&gt; means "class ''X'' is an element of class ''Y''". A ''set'' is a class that is an element of a class. Small case variables ''x'', ''y'', etc. stand for sets. A ''proper class'' is a class that is not a set. Two classes are [[Equinumerosity|''equinumerous'']] iff a [[bijection]] exists between them. A class is ''infinite'' iff it is equinumerous with one of its proper subclasses. The axioms of PST are
:'''(A1)''' (''extensionality'') — Classes that have the same elements are the same.

::&lt;math&gt; \forall z \, ( z \in X \leftrightarrow z \in Y ) \rightarrow X = Y &lt;/math&gt;

:'''(A2)''' (''class comprehension'') — If &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle{\phi (x)} &lt;/math&gt; is a formula, then there exists a class the elements of which are exactly those sets ''x'' that satisfy &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle{\phi (x)} &lt;/math&gt;.
:: &lt;math&gt; \exists Y \forall x \, ( x \in Y \leftrightarrow \phi (x)) &lt;/math&gt;

:'''(A3)''' (''axiom of infinity'') — There is an infinite set, and all infinite sets are equinumerous.
:: &lt;math&gt; \exists x \, ( \mathrm{inf}(x) \land \forall y \, ( \mathrm{inf}(y) \rightarrow x \approx y ) ) &lt;/math&gt;
::(inf(''x'') stands for “''x'' is infinite”; &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ x \approx y }&lt;/math&gt; abbreviates that ''x'' is equinumerous with ''y''.)
:'''(A4)''' (''limitation of size'') – A class is a proper class if and only if it is equinumerous with all proper classes.

::&lt;math&gt; \forall X \forall Y \, ( ( \mathrm{pr}(X) \land \mathrm{pr}(Y) ) \leftrightarrow ( \mathrm{pr}(X) \land X \approx Y ) )&lt;/math&gt;
::(pr(''X'') stands for “''X'' is a proper class”.)

== Remarks on the axioms ==
* Although different kinds of variables are used for classes and sets, the language is not many-sorted; sets are identified with classes having the same extension. Small case variables are used as mere abbreviations for various contexts; e.g.,
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \, \phi (x) \Leftrightarrow_{\mathrm{def}} \forall X \, ( \mathrm{set}(X) \rightarrow \phi (X) )&lt;/math&gt;
* Since the quantification in A2 ranges over classes, i.e., &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle{\phi (x)} &lt;/math&gt; is not set-bound, A2 is the comprehension scheme of [[Morse–Kelley set theory]], not that of [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]]. This extra strength of A2 is employed in the definition of the ordinals (not presented here).
* Since there is no [[axiom of pairing]], it must be proved that for any two sets ''x'' and ''y'', the [[Ordered pair#Kuratowski definition|Kuratowski pair]] {{''x''},{''x'',''y''}} exists and is a set. Hence proving that there exists a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between two classes does not prove that they are equinumerous.
*Pocket set theory is analogous to third order arithmetic, with the sets and classes corresponding to subsets of the natural numbers and subsets of the powerset of the natural numbers.
*A model for pocket set theory is given by taking the sets of pocket set theory to be the constructible elements of ''HC'' (the set of hereditarily countable sets), and the classes to be the constructible subsets of ''HC''.

== Some PST theorems ==

;1. The Russell class &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt; is a proper class. (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \mathrm{R} =_{\mathrm{def}} \{ x\,|\,x\notin x\} }&lt;/math&gt;)
:''Proof''. &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt; cannot be a set by [[Russell's paradox]]. ∎
;2. The empty class &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \emptyset }&lt;/math&gt; is a set. (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \emptyset =_{\mathrm{def}} \{ x\,|\,x\neq x\} }&lt;/math&gt;)
:''Proof''. Suppose ([[Reductio ad absurdum#In mathematics|towards a contradiction]]) that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \emptyset }&lt;/math&gt; is a proper class. By (A4), &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \emptyset }&lt;/math&gt; must be equinumerous with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt;, in which case &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt; is empty. Let ''i'' be an infinite set, and consider the class &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \{ i\} }&lt;/math&gt;. It is not equinumerous with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \emptyset }&lt;/math&gt;, thus it is a set. It is finite, but its single element is infinite, thus it cannot be an element of itself. Therefore, it is an element of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt;. This contradicts that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt; is empty. ∎
;3. The singleton class &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \{\emptyset\} }&lt;/math&gt; is a set.
:''Proof''. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \{\emptyset\} }&lt;/math&gt; is a proper class. Then by (A4), every proper class is a singleton. Let ''i'' be an infinite set and consider the class &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\{\emptyset,i\}}&lt;/math&gt;. It is neither a proper class (because it is not singleton) nor an element of itself (because it is neither empty nor infinite). Thus &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\{\emptyset,i\}\in R}&lt;/math&gt; holds by definition, so &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt; has at least two elements, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \emptyset }&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\{\emptyset,i\}}&lt;/math&gt;. This contradicts the initial assumption that proper classes are singletons. ∎
;4. &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{ \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt; is infinite.
:''Proof''. Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^- =_{\mathrm{def}} \mathrm{R} \setminus \{\emptyset\}}&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that this class is a set. Then either &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^- \in \mathrm{R}^-}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^- \notin \mathrm{R}^-}&lt;/math&gt;. In the first case, the definition of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^-}&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^- \in \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt;, from, which it follows that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^- \notin \mathrm{R}^-}&lt;/math&gt;, a contradiction. In the second case, the definition of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^-}&lt;/math&gt; implies either &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^- \notin \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^- \in \mathrm{R}^-}&lt;/math&gt;, a contradiction, or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^- = \emptyset}&lt;/math&gt;. But &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^-}&lt;/math&gt; cannot be empty because it has at least one element, namely &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\{\emptyset\}}&lt;/math&gt;. ∎
;5. Every finite class is a set.
:''Proof''. Let ''X'' be a proper class. By (A4), there exists an &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{F:X\longrightarrow \mathrm{R}}&lt;/math&gt; such that ''F'' is a bijection. This contains a pair &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\langle x_0,\emptyset \rangle}&lt;/math&gt;, and for each member ''r'' of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{R}^-}&lt;/math&gt; , a pair &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\langle x,r\rangle}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X^-=X\setminus \lbrace x_0\rbrace}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{F^-=F\setminus \lbrace \langle x_0,\emptyset \rangle \rbrace}&lt;/math&gt;. By (A4), both of these classes exist. Now, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{F^-:X^-\longrightarrow \mathrm{R}^-}&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection. Thus by (A4), &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X^-}&lt;/math&gt; is a proper class, too. Clearly, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X^-\subseteq X}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X^-\neq X}&lt;/math&gt;. Now, another application of (A4) shows that there exists a bijection &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{G:X\longrightarrow X^-}&lt;/math&gt;. This proves that ''X'' is infinite. ∎
Once the above facts are settled, the following results can be proved:
;6. The class V of sets (&lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle{\mathrm{V} =_{\mathrm{def}} \{ x\,|\mathrm{set}(x)\}} &lt;/math&gt;) consists of all hereditarily countable sets.
;7. Every proper class has the cardinality &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak c}&lt;/math&gt;.
:''Proof''. Let ''i'' be an infinite set, in which case the class &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle{\mathcal{P}(i)} &lt;/math&gt; has cardinality &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{2^{\aleph_0}}&lt;/math&gt;. By (A4), all proper classes have cardinality &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{2^{\aleph_0}}&lt;/math&gt;. ∎
;8. The union class of a set is a set.

'''PST''' also verifies the:
*[[Continuum hypothesis]]. This follows from (5) and (6) above;
*[[Axiom of replacement]]. This is a consequence of (A4);
*[[Axiom of choice]]. ''Proof''. The class ''Ord'' of all ordinals is well-ordered by definition. ''Ord'' and the class ''V'' of all sets are both proper classes, because of the [[Burali-Forti paradox]] and  [[Cantor's paradox]], respectively. Therefore there exists a bijection between ''V'' and ''Ord'', which well-orders ''V''. ∎

The [[well-foundedness]] of all sets is neither provable nor disprovable in '''PST'''.

== Possible extensions ==

*Adding the so-called ''axiom of free construction'' to '''PST''', any consistent system of set-theoretical axioms will have an inner model in the resulting system.
*It is an unfriendly feature of '''PST''' that it cannot handle classes of sets of real numbers or classes of sets of real functions. However, it is not a necessary one. (A3) can be modified various ways to allow for various portions of the usual hierarchy of infinites, with or without supporting the continuum hypothesis. One example is

The '''principle of nonvacuous contrast''' is a logical or methodological principle which requires that a genuine predicate never refer to everything, or to nothing, within its [[universe of discourse]].

The '''quagga''' ({{IPAc-en|'|k|w|ɑː||x|ɑː}} or {{IPAc-en|'|k|w|æ|g|ə}})&lt;ref name=Max&gt;{{cite news|last=Max|first=D.

It was long thought to be a distinct species, but early [[genetic studies]] have supported it being a [[subspecies]] of plains zebra. A more recent study suggested that it was merely the southernmost [[ecotype]] of the species. The name was derived from its call, which sounded like "kwa-ha-ha".

The quagga is believed to have been around {{convert|257|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|125|–|135|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder. It was distinguished from other zebras by its limited pattern of primarily brown and white stripes, mainly on the front part of the body. The rear was brown and without stripes, and therefore more horse-like. The distribution of stripes varied considerably between individuals. Little is known about the quagga's behaviour, but it may have gathered into herds of 30–50. Quaggas were said to be wild and lively, yet were also considered more docile than Burchell's zebra. They were once found in great numbers in the [[Karoo]] of [[Cape Province]] and the southern part of the [[Orange Free State]] in South Africa.

After the Dutch settlement of South Africa began, the quagga was heavily hunted as it competed with domesticated animals for forage. Some were taken to zoos in Europe, but breeding programmes were unsuccessful. The last wild population lived in the Orange Free State, and the quagga was [[extinct in the wild]] by 1878. The last captive specimen died in Amsterdam on 12 August 1883. Only one quagga was ever photographed alive and only 23 skins are preserved today. In 1984, the quagga was the first extinct animal to have its [[DNA]] analysed, and the [[Quagga Project]] is trying to recreate the [[phenotype]] of hair coat pattern and related characteristics by [[selectively breeding]] Burchell's zebras.

==Taxonomy==
[[File:Daniell Quagga.jpg|thumb|left|1804 illustration by [[Samuel Daniell]], which was the basis of the supposed [[subspecies]] ''E. q. danielli'']]
The name "quagga" is derived from the [[Khoikhoi]] word for ''zebra'' and is [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]], being said to resemble the quagga's call, variously transcribed as "kwa-ha-ha",&lt;ref name=skinner&gt;{{cite book |last=Skinner |first=J.

Much debate has occurred over the status of the quagga in relation to the plains zebra. It is poorly represented in the fossil record, and the identification of these fossils is uncertain, as they were collected at a time when the name "quagga" referred to all zebras.&lt;ref name="skinner" /&gt; Fossil skulls of ''Equus mauritanicus'' from Algeria have been claimed to show affinities with the quagga and the plains zebra, but they may be too badly damaged to allow definite conclusions to be drawn from them.&lt;ref name="Azzaroli"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Azzaroli |first1=A. |last2=Stanyon |first2=R. |doi=10.1007/BF03001000 |title=Specific identity and taxonomic position of the extinct Quagga |journal=Rendiconti Lincei |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=425 |year=1991 |pmid= |pmc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quaggas have also been identified in [[cave art]] attributed to the [[San people|San]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ouzman |first1=S. |last2=Taçon |first2=P.

As the quagga was scientifically described and named before the plains zebra, the [[trinomial nomenclature|trinomial name]] for the quagga becomes ''E. quagga quagga'' under this scheme, and the other subspecies of plains zebra are placed under ''E. quagga'', as well.&lt;ref name="Azzaroli"/&gt;

Historically, quagga taxonomy was further complicated because the extinct southernmost population of [[Burchell's zebra]] (''Equus quagga burchellii'', formerly ''Equus burchellii burchellii'') was thought to be a distinct subspecies (also sometimes thought a full species, ''E. burchellii''). The extant northern population, the "Damara zebra", was later named ''Equus quagga antiquorum'', which means that it is today also referred to as ''E. q. burchellii'', after it was realised they were the same [[taxon]]. The extinct population was long thought very close to the quagga, since it also showed limited striping on its hind parts.&lt;ref name="Hippotigris"/&gt; As an example of this, Shortridge placed the two in the now disused subgenus ''Quagga'' in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Groves |first1=C.

Different subspecies of plains zebras were recognised as members of ''Equus quagga'' by early researchers, though much confusion existed over which species were valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=St. Leger |first1=J. |title =LXVII.—On ''Equus quagga'' of South-western and Eastern Africa |doi=10.1080/00222933208673614 |journal=Journal of Natural History Series 10 |volume=10 |issue=60 |pages=587–593 |year=1932 |pmid= |pmc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quagga subspecies were described on the basis of differences in striping patterns, but these differences were since attributed to [[individual variation]] within the same populations.&lt;ref name="ungulates"/&gt; Some subspecies and even species, such as ''E. q. danielli'' and ''Hippotigris isabellinus'', were only based on illustrations (iconotypes) of aberrant quagga specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schlawe |first=L. |last2=Wozniak |first2=W. |title=Über die ausgerotteten Steppenzebras von Südafrika QUAGGA und DAUW, ''Equus quagga quagga'' |journal=Zeitschrift Des Kölner Zoos |series= |volume=2 |edition= |location= |language=German |pages=97–128 |doi= |isbn= |year=2010 |zbl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.5962/bhl.title.21334 |title=The Natural History of Horses: The Equidae or Genus ''Equus'' of Authors |year=1841 |last1=Smith |first1=C.

Lizars |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have described the quagga as a kind of [[wild horse]] rather than a zebra, and one [[craniometric]] study from 1980 seemed to confirm its affiliation with the [[horse]] (''Equus caballus'').&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;  Early [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] studies have been pointed out to be  erroneous; using skeletons from stuffed specimens can be problematical, as early taxidermists sometimes used [[donkey]] and horse skulls inside their mounts when the originals were unavailable.&lt;ref name="Project"/&gt;

===Evolution===
[[Image:Quagga in enclosure.jpg|thumb|left|The mare in London Zoo, 1870]]
The quagga was the first extinct animal to have its [[DNA]] analysed,&lt;ref name="1984 quagga"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/312282a0 |last1=Higuchi |first1=R. |last2=Bowman |first2=B. |last3=Freiberger |first3=M. |last4=Ryder |first4=O.

It confirmed that the quagga was more closely related to zebras than to horses,&lt;ref name="smithsonian"/&gt; with the quagga and [[mountain zebra]] (''Equus zebra'') sharing an ancestor 3–4 million years ago.&lt;ref name="1984 quagga"/&gt; An [[immunological]] study published the following year found the quagga to be closest to the plains zebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lowenstein |first1=J.

Later morphological studies came to conflicting conclusions. A 1999 analysis of cranial measurements found that the quagga was as different from the plains zebra as the latter is from the mountain zebra.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"/&gt; A 2004 study of skins and skulls instead suggested that the quagga was not a distinct species, but a subspecies of the plains zebra.&lt;ref name="Hippotigris"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Groves |first1=C.

[[Image:Berlin Quagga.jpg|thumb|Skin in [[Natural History Museum, Berlin|Berlin's Natural History Museum]], which has been sampled for [[DNA]]]]
A [[genetic study]] published in 2005 confirmed the subspecific status of the quagga. It showed that the quagga had little genetic diversity, and that it diverged from the other plains zebra subspecies only between 120,000 and 290,000 years ago, during the [[Pleistocene]], and possibly the penultimate glacial maximum. Its distinct coat pattern perhaps evolved rapidly because of geographical isolation and/or adaptation to a drier environment. In addition, plains zebra subspecies tend to have less striping the further south they live, and the quagga was the most southern-living of them all. Other large African [[ungulates]] diverged into separate species and subspecies during this period, as well, probably because of the same climate shift.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hofreiter |first1=M. |last2=Caccone |first2=A. |last3=Fleischer |first3=R.

A 2018 genetic study of plains zebras populations confirmed the quagga as a member of the species. They found no evidence for subspecific differentiation based on morphological differences between southern populations of zebras, including the quagga. Modern plains zebra populations may have originated from southern Africa, and the quagga appears to be less divergent from neighbouring populations than the northernmost living population in northeastern [[Uganda]]. Instead, the study supported a north-south genetic continuum for plains zebras, with the Ugandan population being the most distinct. Zebras from [[Namibia]] appear to be the closest genetically to the quagga.&lt;ref name="PedersenAlbrechtsen2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pedersen |first1=Casper-Emil T. |last2=Albrechtsen |first2=Anders |last3=Etter |first3=Paul D. |last4=Johnson |first4=Eric A. |last5=Orlando |first5=Ludovic |last6=Chikhi |first6=Lounes |last7=Siegismund |first7=Hans R. |last8=Heller |first8=Rasmus |title=A southern African origin and cryptic structure in the highly mobile plains zebra |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=491–498 |issn=2397–334X |doi=10.1038/s41559-017-0453-7 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0453-7 |date=2018-01-22 |access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Quagga.jpg|thumb|Painting of a [[stallion]] in [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]'s menagerie at [[Versailles]] by Nicolas Maréchal, 1793]]
The quagga is believed to have been {{convert|257|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|125|–|135|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; Its coat pattern was unique among [[equids]]: zebra-like in the front but more like a horse in the rear.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"/&gt; It had brown and white stripes on the head and neck, brown upper parts and a white belly, tail and legs. The stripes were boldest on the head and neck and became gradually fainter further down the body, blending with the reddish brown of the back and flanks, until disappearing along the back. It appears to have had a high degree of [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]], with some having almost no stripes and others having patterns similar to the extinct southern population of Burchell's zebra, where the stripes covered most of the body except for the hind parts, legs and belly.&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt; It also had a broad dark dorsal stripe on its back. It had a standing [[mane (horse)|mane]] with brown and white stripes.&lt;ref name="1911 quagga"&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Quagga}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Quagga London Zoo.jpg|thumb|left|The London mare with keeper, 1864]]
The only quagga to have been photographed alive was a [[mare]] at the [[Zoological Society of London]]'s [[London Zoo|Zoo]]. Five photographs of this specimen are known, taken between 1863 and 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last =  Huber | first =  W. | title =  Dokumentation der fünf bekannten Lebendaufnahmen vom Quagga, ''Equus quagga quagga'' Gmelin, 1788 (Mammalia, Perissodactyla, Equidae) | journal = Spixiana  | volume = 17  | pages = 193–199  | language =  German | year = 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of photographs and written descriptions, many observers suggest that the stripes on the quagga were light on a dark background, unlike other zebras. [[Reinhold Rau]], pioneer of the [[Quagga Project]], claimed that this is an [[optical illusion]]: that the base colour is a creamy white and that the stripes are thick and dark.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; [[Embryological]] evidence supports zebras being dark coloured with white as an addition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Prothero, D. R. |author2=Schoch, R. M. |year=2003|title=Horns, Tusks, and Flippers: The Evolution of Hoofed Mammals|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|page=221|isbn=978-0-8018-7135-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Living in the very southern end of the plains zebra's range, the quagga had a thick [[Coat (animal)|winter coat]] that [[Moulting|moulted]] each year. Its skull was described as having a straight profile and a [[wikt:concavity|concave]] [[diastema]], and as being relatively broad with a narrow [[occiput]].&lt;ref name="Hippotigris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kingdon"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kingdon, J.|year=1988|title=East African Mammals: An Atlas of Evolution in Africa, Volume 3, Part B: Large Mammals|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=139|isbn=978-0-226-43722-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other plains zebras, the quagga did not have a [[dewlap]] on its neck as the mountain zebra does.&lt;ref name="Azzaroli"/&gt; The 2004 morphological study found that the skeletal features of the southern Burchell's zebra population and the quagga overlapped, and that they were impossible to distinguish. Some specimens also appeared to be intermediate between the two in striping, and the extant Burchell's zebra population still exhibits limited striping. It can therefore be concluded that the two subspecies graded morphologically into each other. Today, some stuffed specimens of quaggas and southern Burchell's zebra are so similar that they are impossible to definitely identify as either, since no location data was recorded. The female specimens used in the study were larger than the males on average.&lt;ref name="Hippotigris"/&gt;

The quagga was the southernmost distributed plains zebra, mainly living south of the [[Orange River]]. It was a grazer, and its habitat range was restricted to the grasslands and arid interior scrubland of the [[Karoo]] region of [[South Africa]], today forming parts of the provinces of  [[Northern Cape]], [[Eastern Cape]], [[Western Cape]] and the [[Free State (province)|Free State]].&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heywood"/&gt; These areas were known for distinctive flora and fauna and high amounts of [[endemism]].&lt;ref name="Kingdon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moehlmen"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hack |first1=M.

Little is known about the behaviour of quaggas in the wild, and it is sometimes unclear what exact species of zebra is referred to in old reports.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; The only source that unequivocally describes the quagga in the Free State is that of the English military engineer and hunter [[William Cornwallis Harris|Major Sir William Cornwallis Harris]].&lt;ref name="Hippotigris"/&gt; His 1840 account reads as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The geographical range of the quagga does not appear to extend to the northward of the river Vaal. The animal was formerly extremely common within the colony; but, vanishing before the strides of civilisation, is now to be found in very limited numbers and on the borders only. Beyond, on those sultry plains which are completely taken possession of by wild beasts, and may with strict propriety be termed the domains of savage nature, it occurs in interminable herds; and, although never intermixing with its more elegant congeners, it is almost invariably to be found ranging with the white-tailed gnu and with the ostrich, for the society of which bird especially it evinces the most singular predilection. Moving slowly across the profile of the ocean-like horizon, uttering a shrill, barking neigh, of which its name forms a correct imitation, long files of quaggas continually remind the early traveller of a rival caravan on its march. Bands of many hundreds are thus frequently seen doing their migration from the dreary and desolate plains of some portion of the interior, which has formed their secluded abode, seeking for those more luxuriant pastures where, during the summer months, various herbs thrust forth their leaves and flowers to form a green carpet, spangled with hues the most brilliant and diversified.&lt;ref name="CassellNH"&gt;Sir Cornwallis Harris, quoted in {{cite book |last=Duncan |first=F.

Quaggas have been reported gathering into herds of 30–50, and sometimes travelled in a linear fashion.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; They may have been [[Sympatry|sympatric]] with Burchell's zebra between the [[Vaal River|Vaal]] and Orange rivers.&lt;ref name="Hippotigris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moehlmen" /&gt; This is disputed,&lt;ref name="Hippotigris"/&gt; and there is no evidence that they interbred.&lt;ref name="Moehlmen" /&gt; It could also have shared a small portion of its range with [[Hartmann's mountain zebra]] (''Equus zebra hartmannae'').&lt;ref name="smithsonian" /&gt;

Quaggas were said to be lively and highly strung, especially the stallions. During the 1830s, quaggas were used as harness animals for carriages in London, the males probably being [[gelded]] to mitigate their volatile nature.&lt;ref name="Piper2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Piper |first=R. |title=Extinct animals: an encyclopedia of species that have disappeared during human history |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k2tFAQAAIAAJ |accessdate=23 June 2013 |date=20 March 2009 |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0-313-34987-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local farmers used them as guards for their livestock, as they were likely to attack intruders.&lt;ref name="Weddell" /&gt; On the other hand, captive quaggas in European zoos were said to be tamer and more docile than Burchell's zebra.&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt; One specimen was reported to have lived in captivity for 21 years and 4 months, dying in 1872.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nowak |first=R.

Since the practical function of striping has not been determined for zebras in general, it is unclear why the quagga lacked stripes on its hind parts. A [[Crypsis|cryptic]] function for protection from predators (stripes obscure the individual zebra in a herd) and biting flies (which are less attracted to striped objects), as well as various social functions, have been proposed for zebras in general. Differences in hind quarter stripes may have aided [[species recognition]] during stampedes of mixed herds, so that members of one subspecies or species would follow its own kind. It has also been evidence that the zebras developed striping patterns as [[thermoregulation]] to cool themselves down, and that the quagga lost them due to living in a cooler climate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Larison |first1=B. |last2=Harrigan |first2=R.

==Decline and extinction==

[[File:Em - Equus quagga quagga - GMZ 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|One of seven known skeletons, [[Grant Museum]]]]
As it was easy to find and kill, the quagga was hunted by early Dutch settlers and later by [[Afrikaner]]s to provide meat or for their skins. The skins were traded or used locally. The quagga was probably vulnerable to extinction due to its limited distribution, and it may have competed with domestic livestock for forage.&lt;ref name="Weddell"&gt;{{cite book|author=Weddell, B. J.|year=2002|title=Conserving Living Natural Resources: In the Context of a Changing World|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=46|isbn=978-0-521-78812-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quagga had disappeared from much of its range by the 1850s. The last population in the wild, in the [[Orange Free State]], was [[Local extinction|extirpated]] in the late 1870s.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; The last known wild quagga died in 1878.&lt;ref name="Weddell"/&gt;

Quaggas were captured and shipped to Europe, where they were displayed in zoos.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt; [[George Douglas, 16th Earl of Morton|Lord Morton]] tried to save the animal from extinction by starting a captive-breeding programme. He was only able to obtain a single male, which in desperation he bred with a female horse. This produced a female hybrid with zebra stripes on its back and legs. [[Lord Morton's mare]] was sold and was subsequently bred with a black stallion, resulting in offspring that again had zebra stripes. An account of this was published in 1820 by the [[Royal Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Birkhead, T. R.|year=2003|title=A Brand New Bird: How Two Amateur Scientists Created the First Genetically Engineered Animal|publisher=Basic Books|page=145|isbn=978-0-465-00665-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to new ideas on [[telegony (pregnancy)|telegony]], referred to as [[pangenesis]] by [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref name="Heywood"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Heywood | first1 = P. | title = The quagga and science: What does the future hold for this extinct zebra? | doi = 10.1353/pbm.2013.0008 | journal = Perspectives in Biology and Medicine | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 53–64 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23748526| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the close of the 19th century, the Scottish zoologist [[James Cossar Ewart]] argued against these ideas and proved, with several cross-breeding experiments, that zebra stripes can pop up as an [[Atavism|atavistic]] trait at any time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Monument for the Quagga|last=Reinier|first=Spreen|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=9781370284931|location=Amsterdam, The Netherlands|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quagga was long regarded a suitable candidate for domestication, as it counted as the most docile of the striped horses. The earliest Dutch colonists in South Africa had already fantasized about this possibility, because their imported work horses did not perform very well in the extreme climate and regularly fell prey to the feared [[African horse sickness]]. In 1843, the English naturalist [[Charles Hamilton Smith]] wrote that the quagga was 'unquestionably best calculated for domestication, both as regards strength and docility'. Only a few descriptions have been given of tame or domesticated quaggas in South Africa. In Europe, the only confirmed cases are two stallions driven in a phaeton by Joseph Wilfred Parkins, sheriff of London in 1819-1820, and the quaggas and their hybrid offspring of London Zoo, which were used to pull a cart and transport vegetables from the market to the zoo. Nevertheless, the reveries continued long after the death of the last quagga in 1883. In 1889, the naturalist Henry Bryden wrote: "That an animal so beautiful, so capable of domestication and use, and to be found not long since in so great abundance, should have been allowed to be swept from the face of the earth, is surely a disgrace to our latter-day civilization."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kloof and Karoo|last=Bryden|first=H.|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co|year=1889|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

[[File:Quagga exhibit Leiden.jpg|thumb|The last known quagga and a [[great auk]], in [[Naturalis]], [[Leiden]]]]
The specimen in London died in 1872 and the one in Berlin in 1875. The last captive quagga, a female in Amsterdam's [[Natura Artis Magistra]] zoo, lived there from 9 May 1867 until it died on 12 August 1883, but its origin and cause of death are unclear.&lt;ref name="ungulates"&gt;{{cite journal  | last =  Van Bruggen | first = A.C.  | title = Illustrated notes on some extinct South African ungulates | journal = South African Journal of Science  | series =   | volume = 55 | edition =   | location =   | year = 1959  | pages = 197–200  | doi =   | isbn =   | mr =   | zbl =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its death was not recognised as signifying the extinction of its kind at the time, and the zoo requested another specimen; hunters believed it could still be found "closer to the interior" in the Cape Colony. Since locals used the term quagga to refer to all zebras, this may have led to the confusion. The extinction of the quagga was internationally accepted by the 1900 [[Convention for the Preservation of Wild Animals, Birds and Fish in Africa]]. The last specimen was featured on a Dutch stamp in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Vos|first1=R.|title=Stripes faded, barking silenced: remembering quagga|journal=Animal Studies Journal|date=2014|volume=3|issue=1|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/asj/vol3/iss1/4/|language=en|issn=2201-3008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 23 known stuffed and mounted quagga specimens throughout the world, including a juvenile, two foals, and a foetus.

===Breeding back project===

After the very close relationship between the quagga and extant plains zebras was discovered, Reinhold Rau started the Quagga Project in 1987 in South Africa to create a quagga-like zebra population by [[selectively breeding]] for a reduced stripe pattern from plains zebra stock, with the eventual aim of introducing them to the quagga's former range.  To differentiate between the quagga and the zebras of the project, they refer to it as "Rau quaggas".&lt;ref name="Heywood"/&gt; The founding population consisted of 19 individuals from Namibia and South Africa, chosen because they had reduced striping on the rear body and legs. The first foal of the project was born in 1988. Once a sufficiently quagga-like population has been created, participants in the project plan to release them in the Western Cape.&lt;ref name="Project"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Harley | first1 = E.

Introduction of these quagga-like zebras could be part of a comprehensive restoration programme, including such ongoing efforts as eradication of non-native trees. Quaggas, wildebeest, and ostriches, which occurred together during historical times in a mutually beneficial association, could be kept together in areas where the indigenous vegetation has to be maintained by grazing. In early 2006, the third- and fourth-generation animals produced by the project were considered looking much like the depictions and preserved specimens of the quagga. This type of selective breeding is called [[breeding back]]. The practice is controversial, since the resulting zebras will resemble the quaggas only in external appearance, but will be genetically different. The technology to use recovered DNA for cloning does not yet exist.&lt;ref name="Max" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Freeman | first1 = C. | chapter = Ending Extinction: The Quagga, the Thylacine, and the 'Smart Human'| doi = 10.1007/978-90-481-2479-4_13 | title = Leonardo's Choice | pages = 235–256 | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-90-481-2478-7 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="73775">{{about|the philosophical concept|other uses|Qualia (disambiguation)}}
In [[philosophy]] and certain models of [[psychology]], '''qualia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|ɑː|l|i|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|eɪ|l|i|ə}}; singular form: '''quale''') are defined to be individual instances of [[Subjectivity|subjective]], [[consciousness|conscious experience]]. The term ''qualia'' derives from the [[Latin]] neuter plural form (''qualia'') of the Latin adjective ''[[:wikt:qualis|quālis]]'' ({{IPA-la|ˈkʷaːlɪs}}) meaning "of what sort" or "of what kind" in a specific instance like "what it is like to taste a specific apple, this particular apple now". 

Examples of qualia include the perceived sensation of ''pain'' of a headache, the ''taste'' of wine, as well as the ''redness'' of an evening sky. As qualitative characters of sensation, qualia stand in contrast to "[[propositional attitude]]s",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies In Philosophy of Mind|last = Kriegel|first = Uriah|publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-415-53086-6|location = New York, NY|pages = 201}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the focus is on beliefs about experience rather than what it is directly like to be experiencing.

[[Philosopher]] and [[cognitive scientist]] [[Daniel Dennett]] once suggested that ''qualia'' was "an unfamiliar term for something that could not be more familiar to each of us: the ways things seem to us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/quinqual.htm |title=Dennett, D. '&amp;#39;Quining Qualia'&amp;#39; |publisher=Ase.tufts.edu |date=1985-11-21 |accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the debate over their importance hinges on the definition of the term, and various philosophers emphasize or deny the existence of certain features of qualia. Consequently, the nature and existence of various definitions of qualia remains controversial due to qualia not being a pragmatically verifiable matter.

== Definitions ==
[[File:Red.svg|150px|thumb|Saturated colors are a commonly used example of a quale.]]

There are many definitions of qualia, which have changed over time. One of the simpler, broader definitions is: "The 'what it is like' character of mental states. The way it feels to have mental states such as pain, seeing red, smelling a rose, etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Eliasmith |url=http://philosophy.uwaterloo.ca/MindDict/qualia.html |title=Dictionary of Philosophy of Mind - qualia |publisher=Philosophy.uwaterloo.ca |date=2004-05-11 |accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clarence Irving Lewis]], in his book ''[[Mind and the World Order]]'' (1929), was the first to use the term "qualia" in its generally agreed upon modern sense.
{{quote|There are recognizable qualitative characters of the given, which may be repeated in different experiences, and are thus a sort of universals; I call these "qualia." But although such qualia are universals, in the sense of being recognized from one to another experience, they must be distinguished from the properties of objects. Confusion of these two is characteristic of many historical conceptions, as well as of current essence-theories. The quale is directly intuited, given, and is not the subject of any possible error because it is purely subjective.{{cn|date=September 2017}}}}

[[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] (1982) later defined qualia as "...certain features of the bodily sensations especially, but also of certain perceptual experiences, which no amount of purely physical information includes" (p.&amp;nbsp;273).{{Page missing|date=September 2017}}

[[Daniel Dennett]] identifies four properties that are commonly ascribed to qualia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/quinqual.htm |title=Dennett, D. '&amp;#39;Quining Qualia'&amp;#39; |publisher=Ase.tufts.edu |date=1985-11-21 |accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these, qualia are:
# ''[[ineffability|ineffable]]''; that is, they cannot be communicated, or apprehended by any other means than direct experience.
# ''[[intrinsic]]''; that is, they are non-relational properties, which do not change depending on the experience's relation to other things.
# ''[[wiktionary:Private|private]]''; that is, all interpersonal comparisons of qualia are systematically impossible.
# ''directly or immediately apprehensible in [[consciousness]]''; that is, to experience a quale is to know one experiences a quale, and to know all there is to know about that quale.

If qualia of this sort exist, then a normally sighted person who sees red would be unable to describe the experience of this [[perception]] in such a way that a listener who has never experienced color will be able to know everything there is to know about that experience. Though it is possible to make an [[analogy]], such as "red looks hot", or to provide a description of the conditions under which the experience occurs, such as "it's the color you see when light of 700-[[nanometer|nm]] wavelength is directed at you", supporters of this kind of qualia contend that such a description is incapable of providing a complete description of the experience.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Another way of defining qualia is as "raw feels". A ''raw feel'' is a perception in and of itself, considered entirely in isolation from any effect it might have on behavior and behavioral disposition. In contrast, a ''cooked feel'' is that perception seen as existing in terms of its effects. For example, the perception of the taste of wine is an ineffable, raw feel, while the experience of warmth or bitterness caused by that taste of wine would be a cooked feel.  Cooked feels are not qualia.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

According to an [[argument]] put forth by [[Saul Kripke]] in his paper "Identity and Necessity" (1971), one key consequence of the claim that such things as raw feels can be meaningfully discussed—that qualia exist—is that it leads to the logical possibility of two entities exhibiting identical behavior in all ways despite one of them entirely lacking qualia. While very few ever claim that such an entity, called a [[philosophical zombie]], actually exists, the mere possibility is claimed to be sufficient to refute [[physicalism]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==Arguments for the existence==
{{See also|Hard problem of consciousness}}
Since it is by definition impossible to convey qualia verbally, it is also impossible to demonstrate them directly in an argument; so a more tangential approach is needed. Arguments for qualia generally come in the form of [[thought experiment]]s designed to lead one to the conclusion that qualia exist.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==="What's it like to be?" argument===
{{Main article|Subjective character of experience}}
Although it does not actually mention the word "qualia", [[Thomas Nagel]]'s paper "[[What Is it Like to Be a Bat?]]"&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, T. (1974). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2183914 What Is It Like to Be a Bat?] 'The Philosophical Review', Vol. 83, No. 4, pp. 435–450&lt;/ref&gt; is often cited in debates over qualia. Nagel argues that consciousness has an essentially subjective character, a what-it-is-like aspect. He states that "an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to ''be'' that organism—something it is like ''for'' the organism."&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, Thomas (1974), "What is it Like to Be a Bat?", Philosophical Review, 83, 435–50; see p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; Nagel also suggests that the subjective aspect of the mind may not ever be sufficiently accounted for by the [[objectivity (science)|objective]] methods of [[reductionism|reductionistic]] science. He claims that "if we acknowledge that a physical theory of mind must account for the subjective character of experience, we must admit that no presently available conception gives us a clue about how this could be done."&lt;ref name="Tye, Michael (2000), 450"&gt;Tye, Michael (2000), p. 450.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he states that "it seems unlikely that any physical theory of mind can be contemplated until more thought has been given to the general problem of subjective and objective."&lt;ref name="Tye, Michael (2000), 450" /&gt;

===Inverted spectrum argument===
{{Main article|Inverted spectrum}}
[[File:Inverted qualia of colour strawberry.jpg|thumb|250px|Inverted qualia]]
The inverted spectrum thought experiment, originally developed by [[John Locke]],&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John (1689/1975), ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', II, xxxii, 15.  Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; invites us to imagine that we wake up one morning and find that for some unknown reason all the colors in the world have been inverted. Furthermore, we discover that no physical changes have occurred in our brains or bodies that would explain this phenomenon. Supporters of the existence of qualia argue that since we can imagine this happening without contradiction, it follows that we are imagining a change in a property that determines the way things look to us, but that has no physical basis.&lt;ref name="InvertedQualiaSEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-inverted/ |title='&amp;#39;Inverted Qualia'&amp;#39;, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HardinPandPR"&gt;Hardin, C.L., 1987, ''Qualia and Materialism: Closing the Explanatory Gap'', Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, 48: 281–98.&lt;/ref&gt; In more detail:
# Metaphysical [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] holds of necessity.
# [[Modal logic|If something is possibly false, it is not necessary]].
# It is conceivable that qualia could have a different relationship to physical brain-states.
# If it is conceivable, then it is possible.
# Since it is possible for qualia to have a different relationship with physical brain-states, they cannot be identical to brain states (by 1).
# Therefore, qualia are non-physical.

The argument thus claims that if we find the inverted spectrum plausible, we must admit that qualia exist (and are non-physical). Some philosophers find it absurd that an armchair argument can prove something to exist, and the detailed argument does involve a lot of assumptions about conceivability and possibility, which are open to criticism. Perhaps it is not possible for a given brain state to produce anything other than a given quale in our universe, and that is all that matters.

The idea that an inverted spectrum would be undetectable in practice is also open to criticism on more scientific grounds (see main article).&lt;ref name="InvertedQualiaSEP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HardinPandPR"/&gt; There is an actual experiment—albeit somewhat obscure—that parallels the inverted spectrum argument. [[George M. Stratton]], professor of [[psychology]] at the University of California, Berkeley, performed an experiment in which he wore special prism glasses that caused the external world to appear upside down.&lt;ref&gt;George M. Stratton, Some preliminary experiments on vision. Psychological Review, 1896&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slater, A. M.(ed.)(1999) Perceptual development: Visual, auditory and speech perception in infancy, East Sussex: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; After a few days of continually wearing the glasses, an adaptation occurred and the external world appeared righted.  When the glasses were removed, the external world again appeared inverted. After a similar period, perception of the external world returned to the "normal" perceptual state. If this argument provides indicia that qualia exist, it does not necessarily follow that they must be non-physical, because that distinction should be considered a separate epistemological issue.

===Zombie argument===
{{Main article|Philosophical zombie}}
A similar argument holds that it is conceivable (or not inconceivable) that there could be physical duplicates of people, called "[[philosophical zombie]]s", without any qualia at all. These "zombies" would demonstrate outward behavior precisely similar to that of a normal human, but would not have a subjective phenomenology. It is worth noting that a necessary condition for the possibility of philosophical zombies is that there be no specific part or parts of the brain that directly give rise to qualia—the zombie can only exist if subjective consciousness is causally separate from the physical brain.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

===Explanatory gap argument===
{{Main article|Explanatory gap}}
[[Joseph Levine (philosopher)|Joseph Levine]]'s paper ''Conceivability, Identity, and the Explanatory Gap'' takes up where the criticisms of conceivability arguments, such as the inverted spectrum argument and the zombie argument, leave off. Levine agrees that conceivability is flawed as a means of establishing metaphysical realities, but points out that even if we come to the ''metaphysical'' conclusion that qualia are physical, there is still an ''explanatory'' problem.
{{quote|While I think this materialist response is right in the end, it does not suffice to put the mind-body problem to rest. Even if conceivability considerations do not establish that the mind is in fact distinct from the body, or that mental properties are metaphysically irreducible to physical properties, still they do demonstrate that we lack an explanation of the mental in terms of the physical.}}

However, such an [[epistemological]] or explanatory problem might indicate an underlying metaphysical issue—the non-physicality of qualia, even if not proven by conceivability arguments is far from ruled out.
{{quote|In the end, we are right back where we started. The explanatory gap argument doesn't demonstrate a gap in nature, but a gap in our understanding of nature. Of course a plausible explanation for there being a gap in our understanding of nature is that there is a genuine gap in nature. But so long as we have countervailing reasons for doubting the latter, we have to look elsewhere for an explanation of the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cognet.mit.edu/posters/TUCSON3/Levine.html |title=Joseph Levine, Conceivability, Identity, and the Explanatory Gap |publisher=Cognet.mit.edu |date=2000-09-26 |accessdate=2010-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831152049/http://cognet.mit.edu/posters/TUCSON3/Levine.html |archivedate=2010-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Knowledge argument===
{{Main article|Knowledge argument}}
In the article "Epiphenomenal Qualia" (1982),&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Frank (1982), "Epiphenomenal Qualia", ''Philosophical Quarterly'', 32, 127–36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] offers what he calls the "knowledge argument" for qualia. One example runs as follows:
{{quote|Mary the color scientist knows all the physical facts about color, including every ''physical'' fact about the experience of color in other people, from the [[behavior]] a particular color is likely to elicit to the specific sequence of [[neurological]] firings that register that a color has been seen. However, she has been confined from birth to a room that is black and white, and is only allowed to observe the outside world through a black and white monitor. When she is allowed to leave the room, it must be admitted that she learns something about the color red the first time she sees it — specifically, she learns what it is like to see that color.}}

This [[thought experiment]] has two purposes. First, it is intended to show that qualia exist. If one agrees with the thought experiment, we believe that Mary gains something after she leaves the room—that she acquires knowledge of a particular thing that she did not possess before. That knowledge, Jackson argues, is knowledge of the quale that corresponds to the experience of seeing red, and it must thus be conceded that qualia are real properties, since there is a difference between a person who has access to a particular quale and one who does not.

The second purpose of this argument is to refute the physicalist account of the mind. Specifically, the knowledge argument is an attack on the physicalist claim about the completeness of physical truths. The challenge posed to [[physicalism]] by the knowledge argument runs as follows:
# Before her release, Mary was in possession of all the physical information about color experiences of other people.
# After her release, Mary learns something about the color experiences of other people.&lt;br&gt; Therefore,
# Before her release, Mary was not in possession of all the information about other people's color experiences, even though she was in possession of all the physical information.&lt;br&gt; Therefore,
# There are truths about other people's color experience that are not physical.&lt;br&gt; Therefore,
# Physicalism is false.

First Jackson argued that qualia are [[epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenal]]: not [[causality|causally]] efficacious with respect to the physical world. Jackson does not give a positive justification for this claim—rather, he seems to assert it simply because it defends qualia against the classic problem of [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]. Our{{Who|date=February 2017}} natural assumption would be that qualia must be causally efficacious in the physical world, but some would ask how we{{Who|date=February 2017}} could argue for their existence if they did not affect our brains. If qualia are to be non-physical properties (which they must be in order to constitute an argument against physicalism), some argue that it is almost impossible to imagine how they could have a causal effect on the physical world. By redefining qualia as epiphenomenal, Jackson attempts to protect them from the demand of playing a causal role.

Later, however, he rejected epiphenomenalism. This, he argues, is because when Mary first sees red, she says "wow", so it must be Mary's qualia that cause her to say "wow". This contradicts epiphenomenalism. Since the Mary's room thought experiment seems to create this contradiction, there must be something wrong with it. This is often referred to as the "there must be a reply" reply.

==Critics of qualia==

===Daniel Dennett===
[[File:Daniel dennett Oct2008.JPG|thumb|Daniel Dennett]]
In ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'' (1991) and "Quining Qualia" (1988),&lt;ref&gt;[http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/quinqual.html Dennett, Daniel (1991). London: Penguin Books; (1988)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] offers an argument against qualia that demonstrates that the above definition breaks down when one tries to make a practical application of it. In a series of [[thought experiment]]s, which he calls "[[intuition pump]]s", he brings qualia into the world of [[neurosurgery]], [[clinical psychology]], and psychological experimentation. His argument shows that, once the concept of qualia is so imported, it turns out that we can either make no use of it in the situation in question, or that the questions posed by the introduction of qualia are unanswerable precisely because of the special properties defined for qualia.

In Dennett's updated version of the inverted spectrum thought experiment, "alternative neurosurgery", you again awake to find that your qualia have been inverted—grass appears red, the sky appears orange, etc. According to the original account, you should be immediately aware that something has gone horribly wrong. Dennett argues, however, that it is impossible to know whether the diabolical neurosurgeons have indeed inverted your qualia (by tampering with your optic nerve, say), or have simply inverted your connection to memories of past qualia. Since both operations would produce the same result, you would have no means on your own to tell which operation has actually been conducted, and you are thus in the odd position of not knowing whether there has been a change in your "immediately apprehensible" qualia.

Dennett's argument revolves around the central objection that, for qualia to be taken seriously as a component of experience—for them to even make sense as a discrete concept—it must be possible to show that
:a) it is possible to know that a change in qualia has occurred, as opposed to a change in something else; or that
:b) there is a difference between having a change in qualia and not having one.

Dennett attempts to show that we cannot satisfy (a) either through introspection or through observation, and that qualia's very definition undermines its chances of satisfying (b).

Supporters of qualia could point out that in order for you to notice a change in qualia, you must compare your current qualia with your memories of past qualia. Arguably, such a comparison would involve immediate apprehension of your current qualia ''and'' your memories of past qualia, but not the past qualia ''themselves''. Furthermore, modern functional brain imaging has increasingly suggested that the memory of an experience is processed in similar ways and in similar zones of the brain as those originally involved in the original perception. This may mean that there would be asymmetry in outcomes between altering the mechanism of perception of qualia and altering their memories. If the diabolical neurosurgery altered the immediate perception of qualia, you might not even notice the inversion directly, since the brain zones which re-process the memories would themselves invert the qualia remembered. On the other hand, alteration of the qualia memories themselves would be processed without inversion, and thus you would perceive them as an inversion. Thus, you might know immediately if memory of your qualia had been altered, but might not know if immediate qualia were inverted or whether the diabolical neurosurgeons had done a sham procedure [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/270/5237/769 (Ungerleider, 1995)].

Dennett also has a response to the [[Mary's room|"Mary the color scientist"]] thought experiment. He argues that Mary would not, in fact, learn something new if she stepped out of her black and white room to see the color red. Dennett asserts that if she already truly knew "everything about color", that knowledge would include a deep understanding of why and how human neurology causes us to sense the "quale" of color. Mary would therefore already know exactly what to expect of seeing red, before ever leaving the room. Dennett argues that the misleading aspect of the story is that Mary is supposed to not merely be knowledgeable about color but to actually know ''all'' the physical facts about it, which would be a knowledge so deep that it exceeds what can be imagined, and twists our intuitions.

If Mary really does know everything physical there is to know about the experience of color, then this effectively grants her almost omniscient powers of knowledge. Using this, she will be able to deduce her own reaction, and figure out exactly what the experience of seeing red will feel like.

Dennett finds that many people find it difficult to see this, so he uses the case of RoboMary to further illustrate what it would be like for Mary to possess such a vast knowledge of the physical workings of the human brain and color vision. RoboMary is an intelligent robot who, instead of the ordinary color camera-eyes, has a software lock such that she is only able to perceive black and white and shades in-between.

RoboMary can examine the computer brain of similar non-color-locked robots when they look at a red tomato, and see exactly how they react and what kinds of impulses occur. RoboMary can also construct a simulation of her own brain, unlock the simulation's color-lock and, with reference to the other robots, simulate exactly how this simulation of herself reacts to seeing a red tomato. RoboMary naturally has control over all of her internal states except for the color-lock. With the knowledge of her simulation's internal states upon seeing a red tomato, RoboMary can put her own internal states directly into the states they would be in upon seeing a red tomato. In this way, without ever seeing a red tomato through her cameras, she will know exactly what it is like to see a red tomato.

Dennett uses this example to show us that Mary's all-encompassing physical knowledge makes her own internal states as transparent as those of a robot or computer, and it is almost straightforward for her to figure out exactly how it feels to see red.

Perhaps Mary's failure to learn exactly what seeing red feels like is simply a failure of language, or a failure of our ability to describe experiences. An alien race with a different method of communication or description might be perfectly able to teach their version of Mary exactly how seeing the color red would feel. Perhaps it is simply a uniquely human failing to communicate first-person experiences from a third-person perspective. Dennett suggests that the description might even be possible using English. He uses a simpler version of the Mary thought experiment to show how this might work. What if Mary was in a room without triangles and was prevented from seeing or making any triangles? An English-language description of just a few words would be sufficient for her to imagine what it is like to see a triangle—she can simply and directly visualize a triangle in her mind. Similarly, Dennett proposes, it is perfectly, logically possible that the quale of what it is like to see red could eventually be described in an English-language description of millions or billions of words.

In "Are we explaining consciousness yet?" (2001), Dennett approves of an account of qualia defined as the deep, rich collection of individual neural responses that are too fine-grained for language to capture. For instance, a person might have an alarming reaction to yellow because of a yellow car that hit her previously, and someone else might have a nostalgic reaction to a comfort food. These effects are too individual-specific to be captured by English words. "If one dubs this inevitable residue ''qualia'', then qualia are guaranteed to exist, but they are just more of the same, dispositional properties that have not yet been entered in the catalog [...]."&lt;ref name=Dennett2001&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Daniel Dennett|title=Are we explaining consciousness yet?|journal=Cognition|date=Apr 2001|volume=79|issue=1-2|pages=221–237|doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(00)00130-X|pmid=11164029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paul Churchland===
According to [[Paul Churchland]], Mary might be considered to be like a [[feral child]]. Feral children have suffered extreme isolation during childhood. Technically when Mary leaves the room, she would not have the ability to see or know what the color red is. A brain has to learn and develop how to see colors. Patterns need to form in the V4 section of the [[visual cortex]]. These patterns are formed from exposure to wavelengths of light. This exposure is needed during the early stages of [[brain]] development. In Mary's case, the identifications and categorizations of [[color]] will only be in respect to representations of black and white.&lt;ref&gt;Churchland, Paul (2004), Knowing qualia: A reply to Jackson (with postscript 1997), in ''There's Something about Mary'', Peter Ludlow, [[Yujin Nagasawa]] and Daniel Stoljar (eds.). Cambridge MA: MIT Press, pp. 163–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gary Drescher===
In his book ''Good and Real'' (2006), [[Gary Drescher]] compares qualia with "[[Hygienic macro|gensym]]s" (generated symbols) in [[Common Lisp]]. These are objects that Lisp treats as having no properties or components and which can only be identified as equal or not equal to other objects. Drescher explains, "we have no introspective access to whatever internal properties make the ''red'' gensym recognizably distinct from the ''green'' [...] even though we know the sensation when we experience it."&lt;ref&gt;Drescher, Gary, ''Good and Real'', MIT Press, 2006. Pages 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this interpretation of qualia, Drescher responds to the Mary thought experiment by noting that "knowing about red-related cognitive structures and the dispositions they [[wikt:engender|engender]]—even if that knowledge were implausibly detailed and exhaustive—would not necessarily give someone who lacks prior color-experience the slightest clue whether the card now being shown is of the color called red." This does not, however, imply that our experience of red is non-mechanical; "on the contrary, gensyms are a routine feature of computer-programming languages".&lt;ref&gt;Tye, Michael (2000), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Lewis===
[[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] has an argument that introduces a new hypothesis about types of knowledge and their transmission in qualia cases. Lewis agrees that Mary cannot learn what red looks like through her monochrome physicalist studies. But he proposes that this doesn't matter. Learning transmits information, but experiencing qualia doesn't transmit information; instead it communicates abilities. When Mary sees red, she doesn't get any new information. She gains new abilities—now she can remember what red looks like, imagine what other red things might look like and recognize further instances of redness. Lewis states that Jackson's thought experiment uses the "Phenomenal Information Hypothesis"—that is, the new knowledge that Mary gains upon seeing red is phenomenal information. Lewis then proposes a different "Ability Hypothesis" that differentiates between two types of knowledge: knowledge that (information) and knowledge how (abilities). Normally the two are entangled; ordinary learning is also an experience of the subject concerned, and people both learn information (for instance, that Freud was a psychologist) and gain ability (to recognize images of Freud). However, in the thought experiment, Mary can only use ordinary learning to gain know-that knowledge. She is prevented from using experience to gain the know-how knowledge that would allow her to remember, imagine and recognize the color red.

We have the intuition that Mary has been deprived of some vital data to do with the experience of redness. It is also uncontroversial that some things cannot be learned inside the room; for example, we do not expect Mary to learn how to ski within the room. Lewis has articulated that information and ability are potentially different things. In this way, physicalism is still compatible with the conclusion that Mary gains new knowledge. It is also useful for considering other instances of qualia; "being a bat" is an ability, so it is know-how knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, David (2004), What experience teaches, in ''There's Something about Mary'', Peter Ludlow, [[Yujin Nagasawa]] and Daniel Stoljar (eds.). Cambridge MA: MIT Press, pp. 77–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marvin Minsky===
[[File:Marvin Minsky at OLPCb.jpg|thumb|Marvin Minsky]]
The [[artificial intelligence]] researcher [[Marvin Minsky]] thinks the problems posed by qualia are essentially issues of complexity, or rather of mistaking complexity for simplicity.
{{quote|Now, a philosophical dualist might then complain: "You've described how hurting affects your mind—but you still can't express how hurting feels." This, I maintain, is a huge mistake—that attempt to reify "feeling" as an independent entity, with an essence that's indescribable. As I see it, feelings are not strange alien things. It is precisely those cognitive changes themselves that constitute what "hurting" is—and this also includes all those clumsy attempts to represent and summarize those changes. The big mistake comes from looking for some single, simple, "essence" of hurting, rather than recognizing that this is the word we use for complex rearrangement of our disposition of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/minsky/minsky_p4.html |title=Edge interview with Marvin Minsky |publisher=Edge.org |date=1998-02-26 |accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Michael Tye===
[[File:Michael Tye TASC2008.JPG|thumb|Michael Tye]]
[[Michael Tye (philosopher)|Michael Tye]] holds the opinion there are no qualia, no "veils of perception" between us and the referents of our thought. He describes our experience of an object in the world as "transparent". By this he means that no matter what private understandings and/or misunderstandings we may have of some public entity, it is still there before us in reality. The idea that qualia intervene between ourselves and their origins he regards as "a massive error"; as he says, "it is just not credible that visual experiences are systematically misleading in this way";&lt;ref&gt;Tye, Michael (2000), ''Consciousness, Color and Content''. Cambridge MA: MIT Press, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; "the only objects of which you are aware are the external ones making up the scene before your eyes";&lt;ref&gt;Tye, Michael (2000), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; there are "no such things as the qualities of experiences" for "they are qualities of external surfaces (and volumes and films) if they are qualities of anything."&lt;ref&gt;Tye, Michael (2000), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; This insistence permits him to take our experience as having a reliable base since there is no fear of losing contact with the realness of public objects.

In Tye's thought there is no question of qualia without information being contained within them; it is always "an awareness that", always "representational". He characterizes the perception of children as a misperception of referents that are undoubtedly as present for them as they are for grown-ups. As he puts it, they may not know that "the house is dilapidated", but there is no doubt about their seeing the house. After-images are dismissed as presenting no problem for the Transparency Theory because, as he puts it, after-images being illusory, there is nothing that one sees.

Tye proposes that phenomenal experience has five basic elements, for which he has coined the acronym PANIC—Poised, Abstract, Nonconceptual, Intentional Content.&lt;ref&gt;Tye, Michael (2000), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; It is "Poised" in the sense that the phenomenal experience is always presented to the understanding, whether or not the agent is able to apply a concept to it. Tye adds that the experience is "maplike" in that, in most cases, it reaches through to the distribution of shapes, edges, volumes, etc. in the world—you may not be reading the "map" but, as with an actual map there is a reliable match with what it is mapping. It is "Abstract" because it is still an open question in a particular case whether you are in touch with a concrete object (someone may feel a pain in a "left leg" when that leg has actually been amputated). It is "Nonconceptual" because a phenomenon can exist although one does not have the concept by which to recognize it. Nevertheless, it is "Intentional" in the sense that it represents something, again whether or not the particular observer is taking advantage of that fact; this is why Tye calls his theory "representationalism". This last makes it plain that Tye believes that he has retained a direct contact with what produces the phenomena and is therefore not hampered by any trace of a "veil of perception".&lt;ref&gt;Tye (1991) ''The Imagery Debate'', Cambridge MA: MIT Press; (1995) ''Ten Problems of Consciousness: A Representational Theory of the Phenomenal Mind'', Cambridge MA: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proponents of qualia==

===David Chalmers===
[[File:David Chalmers.jpg|thumb|David Chalmers]]
[[David Chalmers]] formulated the [[hard problem of consciousness]], raising the issue of qualia to a new level of importance and acceptance in the field.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In his paper [http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html "Absent Qualia, Fading Qualia, Dancing Qualia"], he also argued for what he called "the principle of organizational invariance". In this paper, he argues that if a system such as one of appropriately configured computer chips reproduces the functional organization of the brain, it will also reproduce the qualia associated with the brain.

===E. J. Lowe===
[[E. J. Lowe (philosopher)|E. J. Lowe]], of Durham University, denies that holding to indirect realism (in which we have access only to sensory features internal to the brain) necessarily implies a Cartesian dualism. He agrees with [[Bertrand Russell]] that our "retinal images"—that is, the distributions across our retinas—are connected to "patterns of neural activity in the cortex" (Lowe 1986). He defends a version of the Causal Theory of Perception in which a causal path can be traced between the external object and the perception of it. He is careful to deny that we do any inferring from the sensory field, a view which he believes allows us to found an access to knowledge on that causal connection. In a later work he moves closer to the non-epistemic theory in that he postulates "a wholly non-conceptual component of perceptual experience",&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, E.J. (1996), ''Subjects of Experience''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; but he refrains from analyzing the relation between the perceptual and the "non-conceptual". Most recently he has drawn attention to the problems that hallucination raises for the direct realist and to their disinclination to enter the discussion on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, E.J. (2008), "Illusions and hallucinations as evidence for sense-data", in ''The Case for Qualia'', Edmond Wright (ed.), Cambridge MA: MIT Press, pp. 59–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===J. B. Maund===
{{Cleanup rewrite|date=September 2014|2=section}}
John Barry Maund, an Australian philosopher of perception at the University of Western Australia,  draws attention to a key distinction of qualia. Qualia are open to being described on two levels, a fact that he refers to as "dual coding". Using the Television Analogy (which, as the [[#The non-epistemic argument|non-epistemic argument]] shows, can be shorn of its objectionable aspects), he points out that, if asked what we see on a television screen there are two answers that we might give:

The states of the screen during a football match are unquestionably different from those of the screen during a chess game, but there is no way available to us of describing the ways in which they are different except by reference to the play, moves and pieces in each game.&lt;ref&gt;Maund, J.B. (1975), "The representative theory of perception", Canadian Journal of Philosophy, 5:1, 44–55; see p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has refined the explanation by shifting to the example of a "[[Movitype]]" screen, often used for advertisements and announcements in public places. A Movitype screen consists of a matrix—or "raster" as the neuroscientists prefer to call it (from the Latin ''rastrum'', a "rake"; think of the lines on a TV screen as "raked" across)—that is made up of an array of tiny light-sources. A computer-led input can excite these lights so as to give the impression of letters passing from right to left, or even, on the more advanced forms now commonly used in advertisements, to show moving pictures. Maund's point is as follows. It is obvious that there are two ways of describing what you are seeing. We could either adopt the everyday public language and say "I saw some sentences, followed by a picture of a 7-Up can." Although that is a perfectly adequate way of describing the sight, nevertheless, there is a scientific way of describing it which bears no relation whatsoever to this commonsense description. One could ask the electronics engineer to provide us with a computer print-out staged across the seconds that you were watching it of the point-states of the raster of lights. This would no doubt be a long and complex document, with the state of each tiny light-source given its place in the sequence. The interesting aspect of this list is that, although it would give a comprehensive and point-by-point-detailed description of the state of the screen, nowhere in that list would there be a mention of "English sentences" or "a 7-Up can".

What this makes clear is that there are two ways to describe such a screen, (1) the "commonsense" one, in which publicly recognizable objects are mentioned, and (2) an accurate point-by-point account of the actual state of the field, but makes no mention of what any passer-by would or would not make of it. This second description would be non-epistemic from the common sense point of view, since no objects are mentioned in the print-out, but perfectly acceptable from the engineer's point of view. Note that, if one carries this analysis across to human sensing and perceiving, this rules out Daniel Dennett's claim that all qualiaphiles must regard qualia as "ineffable", for at this second level they are in principle quite "effable"—indeed, it is not ruled out that some neurophysiologist of the future might be able to describe the neural detail of qualia at this level.

Maund has also extended his argument particularly with reference of color.&lt;ref&gt;Maund, J.B. (1995), ''Colours:  Their Nature and Representation'', Cambridge University Press; (2003), ''Perception'', Chesham, Acumen Pub. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Color he sees as a dispositional property, not an objective one, an approach which allows for the facts of difference between person and person, and also leaves aside the claim that external objects are colored. Colors are therefore "virtual properties", in that it is as if things possessed them; although the naïve view attributes them to objects, they are intrinsic, non-relational inner experiences.

===Moreland Perkins===
In his book ''Sensing the World'',&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, Moreland (1983), ''Sensing the World'', Indianapolis, USA, Hackett Pub. Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreland Perkins argues that qualia need not be identified with their objective sources: a smell, for instance, bears no direct resemblance to the molecular shape that gives rise to it, nor is a toothache actually in the tooth. He is also like Hobbes in being able to view the process of sensing as being something complete in itself; as he puts it, it is not like "kicking a football" where an external object is required—it is more like "kicking a kick", an explanation which entirely avoids the familiar Homunculus Objection, as adhered to, for example, by [[Gilbert Ryle]]. Ryle was quite unable even to entertain this possibility, protesting that "in effect it explained the having of sensations as the not having of sensations."&lt;ref&gt;Ryle, Gilbert (1949), ''The Concept of Mind'', London, Hutchinson, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[A.J. Ayer]] in a rejoinder identified this objection as "very weak" as it betrayed an inability to detach the notion of eyes, indeed any sensory organ, from the neural sensory experience.&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, A.J. (1957), ''The Problem of Knowledge'', Harmondsworth, Penguin Books, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

(1997), "Three laws of qualia; What neurology tells us about the biological functions of consciousness", Journal of Consciousness Studies, 4:5–6, 429–57.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed three laws of qualia (with a fourth later added), which are "functional criteria that need to be fulfilled in order for certain neural events to be associated with qualia" by philosophers of the mind:
{{quote|
# Qualia are irrevocable and indubitable. You don't say 'maybe it is red but I can visualize it as green if I want to'. An explicit neural representation of red is created that invariably and automatically 'reports' this to higher brain centres.
# Once the representation is created, what can be done with it is open-ended. You have the luxury of choice, e.g., if you have the percept of an apple you can use it to tempt Adam, to keep the doctor away, bake a pie, or just to eat. Even though the representation at the input level is immutable and automatic, the output is potentially infinite. This isn't true for, say, a spinal reflex arc where the output is also inevitable and automatic. Indeed, a paraplegic can even have an erection and ejaculate without an orgasm.
# Short-term memory. The input invariably creates a representation that persists in short-term memory—long enough to allow time for choice of output. Without this component, again, you get just a reflex arc.
# Attention. Qualia and attention are closely linked. You need attention to fulfill criterion number two; to choose. A study of circuits involved in attention, therefore, will shed much light on the riddle of qualia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicog.org/publications/Ramachandran_JCS01.pdf |title=Ramachandran, V.S. and Hubbard, E.M.

They proposed that the phenomenal nature of qualia could be communicated (as in "oh ''that'' is what salt tastes like") if brains could be appropriately connected with a "cable of neurons".&lt;ref name="Three laws"/&gt; If this turned out to be possible this would scientifically prove or objectively demonstrate the existence and the nature of qualia.

===Howard Robinson and William Robinson===
[[Howard Robinson]] is a philosopher who has concentrated his research within the [[philosophy of mind]]. Taking what has been through the latter part of the last century an unfashionable stance, he has consistently argued against those explanations of sensory experience that would reduce them to physical origins. He has never regarded the theory of sense-data as refuted, but has set out to refute in turn the objections which so many have considered to be conclusive. The version of the theory of [[sense-data]] he defends takes what is before consciousness in perception to be qualia as mental presentations that are causally linked to external entities, but which are not physical in themselves. Unlike the philosophers so far mentioned, he is therefore a dualist, one who takes both matter and mind to have real and metaphysically distinct natures. His books (particularly ''Matter and Sense'' and ''Perception''&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Howard (1982), ''Matter and Sense: A Critique of Contemporary Materialism'', Cambridge University Press; (1994), ''Perception'', London, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;) are characterized by the thoroughness with which he deals with the arguments of opposing philosophers, thus setting a professional example that it would be well for his opponents to follow (for there has been a tendency to take for granted that the theory of sense-data is wholly obsolescent). In one of his most recent articles he takes the [[physicalist]] to task for ignoring the fact that sensory experience can be entirely free of representational character. He cites phosphenes as a stubborn example ([[phosphenes]] are flashes of neural light that result either from sudden pressure in the brain—as induced, for example, by intense coughing, or through direct physical pressure on the retina), and points out that it is grossly counter-intuitive to argue that these are not visual experiences on a par with open-eye seeing.

William Robinson (no relation) takes a very similar view to that of his namesake. In his most recent book, ''Understanding Phenomenal Consciousness'',&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, William (2004), ''Understanding Phenomenal Consciousness'', Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; he is unusual as a dualist in calling for research programs that investigate the relation of qualia to the brain. The problem is so stubborn, he says, that too many philosophers would prefer "to explain it away", but he would rather have it explained and does not see why the effort should not be made. However, he does not expect there to be a straightforward scientific reduction of phenomenal experience to neural architecture; on the contrary he regards this as a forlorn hope. The "Qualitative Event Realism" that Robinson espouses sees phenomenal consciousness as caused by brain events but not identical with them, being non-material events.

It is noteworthy that he refuses to set aside the vividness—and commonness—of mental images, both visual and aural, standing here in direct opposition to Daniel Dennett, who has difficulty in crediting the experience in others. He is similar to Moreland Perkins in keeping his investigation wide enough to apply to all the senses.

===Edmond Wright===
Edmond Wright is a philosopher who considers the intersubjective aspect of perception.&lt;ref name=nplf&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11485 Wright, Edmond (ed.) (2008), ''The Case for Qualia'', MIT Press, Cambridge, MA].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?is=1403990670 |title=Wright, Edmond (2008) '&amp;#39;Narrative, Perception, Language, and Faith'&amp;#39;, Palgrave-Macmillan, Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave.com |date=2005-11-16 |accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Locke onwards it had been normal to frame perception problems in terms of a single subject S looking at a single entity E with a property p. However, if we begin with the facts of the differences in sensory registration from person to person, coupled with the differences in the criteria we have learned for distinguishing what we together call "the same" things, then a problem arises of how two persons align their differences on these two levels so that they can still get a practical overlap on parts of the real about them—and, in particular, update each other about them.

Wright mentions being struck with the hearing difference between himself and his son, discovering that his son could hear sounds up to nearly 20&amp;nbsp;kilohertz while his range only reached to 14&amp;nbsp;kHz or so. This implies that a difference in qualia could emerge in human action (for example, the son could warn the father of a high-pitched escape of a dangerous gas kept under pressure, the sound-waves of which would be producing no qualia evidence at all for the father). The relevance for language thus becomes critical, for an informative statement can best be understood as an updating of a perception—and this may involve a radical re-selection from the qualia fields viewed as non-epistemic, even perhaps of the presumed singularity of "the" referent, a fortiori if that "referent" is the self. Here he distinguishes his view from that of Revonsuo, who too readily makes his "virtual space" "egocentric".

Wright's particular emphasis has been on what he asserts is a core feature of communication, that, in order for an updating to be set up and made possible, both speaker and hearer have to behave as if they have identified "the same singular thing", which, he notes, partakes of the structure of a joke or a story.&lt;ref name=nplf/&gt; Wright says that this systematic ambiguity seems to opponents of qualia to be a sign of fallacy in the argument (as ambiguity is in pure logic) whereas, on the contrary, it is sign—in talk about "what" is perceived—of something those speaking to each other have to learn to take advantage of. In extending this analysis, he has been led to argue for an important feature of human communication being the degree and character of the faith maintained by the participants in the dialogue, a faith that has priority over what has before been taken to be the key virtues of language, such as "sincerity", "truth", and "objectivity". Indeed, he considers that to prioritize them over faith is to move into superstition.

===Erwin Schrödinger===
[[Erwin Schrödinger]], a theoretical physicist and one of the leading pioneers of quantum mechanics, also published in the areas of colorimetry and color perception. In several of his philosophical writings, he defends the notion that qualia are not physical.
{{quote|The sensation of colour cannot be accounted for by the physicist's objective picture of light-waves. Could the physiologist account for it, if he had fuller knowledge than he has of the processes in the retina and the nervous processes set up by them in the optical nerve bundles and in the brain? I do not think so.&lt;ref name="Schrodinger1958" /&gt;{{rp|154}}}}

He continues on to remark that subjective experiences do not form a one-to-one correspondence with stimuli. For example, light of wavelength in the neighborhood of 590&amp;nbsp;nm produces the sensation of yellow, whereas exactly the same sensation is produced by mixing red light, with wavelength 760&amp;nbsp;nm, with green light, at 535&amp;nbsp;nm. From this he concludes that there is no "numerical connection with these physical, objective characteristics of the waves" and the sensations they produce.

Schrödinger concludes with a proposal of how it is that we might arrive at the mistaken belief that a satisfactory theoretical account of qualitative experience has been—or might ever be—achieved:

{{quote|Scientific theories serve to facilitate the survey of our observations and experimental findings. Every scientist knows how difficult it is to remember a moderately extended group of facts, before at least some primitive theoretical picture about them has been shaped. It is therefore small wonder, and by no means to be blamed on the authors of original papers or of text-books, that after a reasonably coherent theory has been formed, they do not describe the bare facts they have found or wish to convey to the reader, but clothe them in the terminology of that theory or theories. This procedure, while very useful for our remembering the fact in a well-ordered pattern, tends to obliterate the distinction between the actual observations and the theory arisen from them. And since the former always are of some sensual quality, theories are easily thought to account for sensual qualities; which, of course, they never do.&lt;ref name="Schrodinger1958"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schrödinger|first=Erwin|title=What is life? : the physical aspects of the living cell.|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=0521427088|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|163–164}}}}

==Neurobiological blending of perspectives==

===Rodolfo Llinás===
When looked at philosophically, qualia become a tipping point between physicality and the metaphysical, which polarizes the discussion, as we've seen above, into "Do they or do they not exist?" and "Are they physical or beyond the physical?" However, from a strictly neurological perspective, they can both exist, and be very important to the organism's survival, and be the result of strict neuronal oscillation, and still not rule out the metaphysical. A good example of this pro/con blending is in [[Rodolfo Llinás]]'s ''I of the Vortex'' (MIT Press, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;202–207). Llinás argues that qualia are ancient and necessary for an organism's survival ''and'' a product of neuronal oscillation. Llinás gives the evidence of anesthesia of the brain and subsequent stimulation of limbs to demonstrate that qualia can be "turned off" with changing only the variable of neuronal oscillation (local brain electrical activity), while all other connections remain intact, arguing strongly for an oscillatory—electrical origin of qualia, or important aspects of them.

===Roger Orpwood===
Roger Orpwood, an engineer with a strong background in studying neural mechanisms, proposed a neurobiological model that gives rise to qualia and ultimately, consciousness. As advancements in cognitive and computational neuroscience continue to grow, the need to study the mind, and qualia, from a scientific perspective follows. Orpwood does not deny the existence of qualia, nor does he intend to debate its physical or non-physical existence. Rather, he suggests that qualia are created through the neurobiological mechanism of [[Reentry (neural circuitry)|re-entrant feedback]] in cortical systems &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Orpwood | first1 = Roger | year = 2007 | title = Neurobiological Mechanisms Underlying Qualia | url = | journal = Journal of Integrative Neuroscience | volume = 06 | issue = 04| pages = 523–33 | doi=10.1142/s0219635207001696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Orpwood | first1 = Roger D | year = 2010 | title = Perceptual Qualia and Local Network Behavior In The Cerebral Cortex | url = | journal = Journal of Integrative Neuroscience | volume = 09 | issue = 02| pages = 123–31 | doi=10.1142/s021963521000241x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orpwood2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Orpwood | first1 = Roger | year = 2013 | title = Qualia Could Arise from Information Processing in Local Cortical Networks | url = | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 1–10 | doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orpwood develops his mechanism by first addressing the issue of information. One unsolved aspect of qualia is the concept of the fundamental information involved in creating the experience. He does not address a position on the metaphysics of the information underlying the experience of qualia, nor does he state what information actually is. However, Orpwood does suggest that information in general is of two types: the information structure and information message. Information structures are defined by the physical vehicles and structural, biological patterns encoding information. That encoded information is the information message; a source describing ''what'' that information is. The neural mechanism or network receives input information structures, completes a designated instructional task (firing of the neuron or network), and outputs a modified information structure to downstream regions. The information message is the purpose and meaning of the information structure and causally exists as a result of that particular information structure. Modification of the information structure changes the meaning of the information message, but the message itself cannot be directly altered.

Local cortical networks have the capacity to receive feedback from their own output information structures. This form of local feedback continuously cycles part of the networks output structures as its next input information structure. Since the output structure must represent the information message derived from the input structure, each consecutive cycle that is fed-back will represent the output structure the network just generated. As the network of mechanisms cannot recognize the information message, but only the input information structure, the network is unaware that it is representing its own previous outputs. The neural mechanisms are merely completing their instructional tasks and outputting any recognizable information structures. Orpwood proposes that these local networks come into an attractor state that consistently outputs exactly the same information structure as the input structure. Instead of only representing the information message derived from the input structure, the network will now represent its own output and thereby its own information message. As the input structures are fed-back, the network identifies the previous information structure as being a previous representation of the information message. As Orpwood states, {{quote| Once an attractor state has been established, the output [of a network] is a representation of its own identity to the network.&lt;ref name="Orpwood2013" /&gt;{{rp|4}}}}

Representation of the networks own output structures, by which represents its own information message, is Orpwood's explanation that grounds the manifestation of qualia via neurobiological mechanisms. These mechanisms are particular to networks of pyramidal neurons. Although computational neuroscience still has much to investigate regarding pyramidal neurons, their complex circuitry is relatively unique. Research shows that the complexity of pyramidal neuron networks is directly related to the increase in the functional capabilities of a species.&lt;ref&gt;Elston, G. N. "Cortex, Cognition and the Cell: New Insights into the Pyramidal Neuron and Prefrontal Function." Cerebral Cortex 13.11 (2003): 124-138.&lt;/ref&gt; When human pyramidal networks are compared with other primate species and species with less intricate behavioral and social interactions, the complexity of these neural networks drastically decline. The complexity of these networks are also increased in frontal brain regions. These regions are often associated with conscious assessment and modification of one's immediate environment; often referred to as ''executive functions''. Sensory input is necessary to gain information from the environment, and perception of that input is necessary for navigating and modifying interactions with the environment. This suggests that frontal regions containing more complex pyramidal networks are associated with an increased perceptive capacity. As perception is necessary for conscious thought to occur, and since the experience of qualia is derived from consciously recognizing some perception, qualia may indeed be specific to the functional capacity of pyramidal networks. This derives Orpwood's notion that the mechanisms of re-entrant feedback may not only create qualia, but also be the foundation to consciousness.

==Other issues==

===Indeterminacy===
It is possible to apply a criticism similar to [[Nietzsche]]'s criticism of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s "[[thing in itself]]" to qualia: Qualia are unobservable in others and unquantifiable in us. We cannot possibly be sure, when discussing individual qualia, that we are even discussing the same phenomena. Thus, any discussion of them is of indeterminate value, as descriptions of qualia are necessarily of indeterminate accuracy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Qualia can be compared to "things in themselves" in that they have no publicly demonstrable properties; this, along with the impossibility of being sure that we are communicating about the same qualia, makes them of [[indeterminacy in philosophy|indeterminate value and definition]] in any philosophy in which proof relies upon precise definition.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} On the other hand, qualia could be considered akin to [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] [[phenomena]] since they are held to be seemings of appearances. Revonsuo, however, considers that, within neurophysiological inquiry, a definition at the level of the fields may become possible (just as we can define a television picture at the level of liquid crystal pixels).

===Causal efficacy===
Whether or not qualia or consciousness can play any causal role in the physical world remains an open question, with [[epiphenomenalism]] acknowledging the existence of qualia while denying it any causal power. The position has been criticized by a number of philosophers,&lt;ref&gt;Epiphenomenalism has few friends. It has been deemed "thoughtless and incoherent" —Taylor, A. (1927). ''Plato: The Man and his Work'', New York, MacVeagh, p. 198; "unintelligible" — Benecke, E.C. (1901) "On the Aspect Theory of the Relation of Mind to Body", Aristotelian Society Proceedings, 1900–1901 n.s. 1: 18–44; "truly incredible" — McLaughlin, B. (1994). Epiphenomenalism, A Companion to the Philosophy of Mind, ed. S. Guttenplan, 277–288. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; if only because our own consciousness seem to be causally active. In order to avoid epiphenomenalism, one who believes that qualia are nonphysical would need to embrace something like [[interactionist dualism]]; or perhaps [[emergentism]], the claim that there are as yet unknown causal relations between the mental and physical. This in turn would imply that qualia can be detected by an external agency through their causal powers.

===Epistemological issues===
To illustrate: one might be tempted to give as examples of qualia "the pain of a headache, the taste of wine, or the redness of an evening sky". But this list of examples already prejudges a central issue in the current debate on qualia.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} An analogy might make this clearer. Suppose someone wants to know the nature of the liquid crystal pixels on a television screen, those tiny elements that provide all the distributions of color that go to make up the picture. It would not suffice as an answer to say that they are the "redness of an evening sky" as it appears on the screen. We would protest that their real character was being ignored. One can see that relying on the list above assumes that we must tie sensations not only to the notion of given objects in the world (the "head", "wine", "an evening sky"), but also to the properties with which we characterize the experiences themselves ("redness", for example).

Nor is it satisfactory to print a little red square as at the top of the article, for, since each person has a slightly different registration of the light-rays,&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, C.L. (1988), ''Color for Philosophers''. Indianapolis IN: Hackett Pub. Co.&lt;/ref&gt; it confusingly suggests that we all have the same response. Imagine in a television shop seeing "a red square" on twenty screens at once, each slightly different—something of vital importance would be overlooked if a single example were to be taken as defining them all.

Yet it has been argued whether or not identification with the external object should still be the core of a correct approach to sensation, for there are many who state the definition thus because they regard the link with external reality as crucial. If sensations are defined as "raw feels", there arises a palpable threat to the reliability of knowledge. The reason has been given that, if one sees them as neurophysiological happenings in the brain, it is difficult to understand how they could have any connection to entities, whether in the body or the external world. It has been declared, by [[John McDowell]] for example, that to countenance qualia as a "bare presence" prevents us ever gaining a certain ground for our knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, John (1994), ''Mind and World''. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue is thus fundamentally an [[epistemological]] one: it would appear that access to knowledge is blocked if one allows the existence of qualia as fields in which only virtual constructs are before the mind.

His reason is that it puts the entities about which we require knowledge behind a "[[veil of perception]]", an occult field of "appearance" which leaves us ignorant of the reality presumed to be beyond it. He is convinced that such uncertainty propels into the dangerous regions of [[relativism]] and [[solipsism]]: relativism sees all truth as determined by the single observer; solipsism, in which the single observer is the only creator of and legislator for his or her own universe, carries the assumption that no one else exists. These accusations constitute a powerful ethical argument against qualia being something going on in the brain, and these implications are probably largely responsible for the fact that in the 20th century it was regarded as not only freakish, but also dangerously misguided to uphold the notion of sensations as going on inside the head. The argument was usually strengthened with mockery at the very idea of "redness" being in the brain: the question was—and still is&lt;ref&gt;O'Regan, Kevin and Noë, Alva (2001), "A sensorimotor account of vision and visual consciousness", Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 24:5, 939–1011.&lt;/ref&gt;—"How can there be red neurons in the brain?" which strikes one as a justifiable appeal to common sense.

To maintain a philosophical balance, the argument for "raw feels" needs to be set side by side with the claim above. Viewing sensations as "raw feels" implies that initially they have not yet—to carry on the metaphor—been "cooked", that is, unified into "things" and "persons", which is something the mind does after the sensation has responded to the blank input, that response driven by motivation, that is, initially by pain and pleasure, and subsequently, when memories have been implanted, by desire and fear. Such a "raw-feel" state has been more formally identified as "non-[[epistemic]]". In support of this view, the theorists cite a range of empirical facts. The following can be taken as representative. There are brain-damaged persons, known as "agnosics" (literally "not-knowing") who still have vivid visual sensations but are quite unable to identify any entity before them, including parts of their own body. There is also the similar predicament of persons, formerly blind, who are given sight for the first time—and consider what it is a newborn baby must experience. A German psychologist of the 19th century, [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], proposed a simple experiment to demonstrate the non-epistemic nature of qualia: his instructions were to stand in front of a familiar landscape, turn your back on it, bend down and look at the landscape between your legs—you will find it difficult in the upside-down view to recognize what you found familiar before.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Richard M. and Warren Roslyn P. (eds.) (1968), ''Helmholtz on Perception: Its Physiology and Development''. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

These examples suggest that a "bare presence"—that is, knowledgeless sensation that is no more than evidence—may really occur. Present supporters of the non-epistemic theory thus regard sensations as only data in the sense that they are "given" (Latin ''datum'', "given") and fundamentally involuntary, which is a good reason for not regarding them as basically mental. In the last century they were called "sense-data" by the proponents of qualia, but this led to the confusion that they carried with them reliable proofs of objective causal origins. For instance, one supporter of qualia was happy to speak of the redness and bulginess of a cricket ball as a typical "sense-datum",&lt;ref&gt;Price, Hubert H. (1932), ''Perception'', London, Methuen, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; though not all of them were happy to define qualia by their relation to external entities (see Roy Wood Sellars&lt;ref&gt;Sellars, Roy Wood (1922), ''Evolutionary Naturalism''. Chicago and London: Open Court Pub. Co.&lt;/ref&gt;). The modern argument, following Sellars' lead, centers on how we learn under the regime of motivation to interpret the sensory evidence in terms of "things", "persons", and "selves" through a continuing process of feedback.

The definition of qualia thus is governed by one's point of view, and that inevitably brings with it philosophical and neurophysiological presuppositions. The question, therefore, of what qualia can be raises profound issues in the [[philosophy of mind]], since some [[materialists]] want to deny their existence altogether: on the other hand, if they are accepted, they cannot be easily accounted for as they raise the difficult problem of consciousness. There are committed [[dualists]] such as Richard L. Amoroso or [[John Hagelin]] who believe that the mental and the material are two distinct aspects of physical reality like the distinction between the classical and quantum regimes.&lt;ref&gt;Amoroso, Richard L. (2010) ''Complementarity of Mind &amp; Body: Realizing the Dream of Descartes, Einstein &amp; Eccles'', New York, Nova Science Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, there are [[direct realism|direct realists]] for whom the thought of qualia is unscientific as there appears to be no way of making them fit within the modern scientific picture; and there are committed proselytizers for a final truth who reject them as forcing knowledge out of reach.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3974">'''RPR''' (rapid problem resolution) is a method of problem diagnosis designed to determine the [[root cause]] of IT problems.

== Overview ==

RPR deals with failures, incorrect output and performance issues, and its particular strengths are in the diagnosis of ongoing &amp; recurring [[Grey problem |grey problems]]. The method comprises:

* Core process
* Supporting techniques

The core process defines a step-by-step approach to problem diagnosis and has three phases:

* Discover
** Gather and review existing information
** Reach an agreed understanding
* Investigate
** Create and execute a diagnostic data capture plan
** Analyse the results and iterate if necessary 
** Identify root cause
* Fix
** Translate diagnostic data
** Determine and implement fix
** Confirm root cause addressed

The supporting techniques detail how the objectives of the core-process steps are achieved, and cite examples using tools and techniques that are available in every business.

== Standards alignment ==

RPR has been fully aligned with ITIL v3 since RPR 2.01 was released in April 2008. RPR fits directly into the [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library#Problem management| ITIL v3 problem management process ]] as a sub-process. Some organisations handle ongoing recurring problems within incident management, and RPR also fits into the [[Incident Management (ITSM) | ITIL v3 incident management process ]] as a sub-process.

[[COBIT ]] also defines a problem management process (DS10) with key activity of ''Perform root cause analysis''.  RPR is a superset of this step in that it defines a process that covers all of the activities needed to perform Problem investigation &amp;amp; diagnosis, including Root Cause identification.

==Limitations and considerations==

RPR has some limitations and considerations, including:

* RPR deals with a single symptom at a time
* RPR identifies the technical root cause of a problem, it can't be used to identify the non-technical root cause with people, process, etc.
* RPR is not a forensic technique and so historical data alone is rarely sufficient
* The Investigate phase requires the user to experience the problem one more time

The method was originally developed by Advance7 in 1990 as Advanced Network Troubleshooting, with the first fully documented version produced in 1995.  Early versions included problem management guidance but this was removed over time as the method became more closely aligned to ITIL, and the method name was changed to Rapid Problem Resolution (RPR).  RPR is now focused on Problem Diagnosis based on Root Cause Identification. Due to the highly practical nature of the Supporting Techniques and the ever changing IT landscape, Advance7 continues to develop RPR to keep it relevant to current IT environments.

Until November 2007 Advance7 made the RPR material available to its employees only, although a limited number of other IT professionals had been trained in the use of the method. In late 2007 the company announced its intention to make RPR training and material more widely available.

In March 2009 the TSO added a significant amount of RPR information to the ITIL Best Practice Live website within the areas dealing with Problem Management.

In September 2011, Advance7 published ''RPR: A Problem Diagnosis Method for IT Professionals'' which fully describes version 2.03 of the method.

[[File:Kostnice Sedlec.JPG|thumbnail|Chapel Interior]]
The '''Sedlec Ossuary''' ({{lang-cs|Kostnice v Sedlci}}) is a small [[Roman Catholic]] [[chapel]], located beneath the Cemetery Church of All Saints (Czech: ''Hřbitovní kostel Všech Svatých''), part of the former [[Sedlec Abbey]] in Sedlec, a suburb of [[Kutná Hora]] in the [[Czech Republic]]. The [[ossuary]] is estimated to contain the [[skeletons]] of between 40,000 and 70,000 people, whose bones have, in many cases, been artistically arranged to form decorations and furnishings for the chapel. The ossuary is among the most visited [[tourist attraction]]s of the Czech Republic - attracting over 200,000 visitors annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nipos-mk.cz/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Statistika-2009_1dil_100922.pdf NIPOS: Statistika kultury 2009 - I. díl - kulturní dědictví (muzea, galerie a památkové objekty)]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Four enormous bell-shaped mounds occupy the corners of the chapel. An enormous [[chandelier]] of bones, which contains at least one of every bone in the human body, hangs from the center of the nave with garlands of [[human skull|skull]]s draping the vault. Other works include piers and [[monstrance]]s flanking the [[altar]], a [[coat of arms]] of the [[House of Schwarzenberg]], and the signature of Rint, also executed in bone, on the wall near the entrance.

==History==
[[Image:Hřbitovní kaple Všech Svatých v Sedlci u Kutné Hory.jpg|thumb|left|Chapel exterior]]
In 1278, Henry, the [[abbot]] of the [[Cistercian]] [[monastery]] in Sedlec, was sent to the [[Holy Land]] by King [[Otakar II of Bohemia]]. He returned with a small amount of earth he had removed from [[Golgotha]] and sprinkled it over the abbey [[cemetery]]. The word of this pious act soon spread and the cemetery in Sedlec became a desirable [[burial]] site throughout [[Central Europe]].

In the mid 14th century, during the [[Black Death]], and after the [[Hussite Wars]] in the early 15th century, many thousands were buried in the abbey cemetery, so it had to be greatly enlarged.

Around 1400, a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church was built in the center of the cemetery with a [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] upper level and a lower chapel to be used as an [[ossuary]] for the mass graves unearthed during construction, or simply slated for demolition to make room for new burials.

After 1511, the task of [[exhumation|exhuming]] skeletons and stacking their bones in the chapel was given to a half-[[blindness|blind]] [[monk]] of the order.

Between 1703 and 1710, a new entrance was constructed to support the front wall, which was leaning outward, and the upper chapel was rebuilt. This work, in the Czech [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style, was designed by [[Jan Santini Aichel]].

In 1870, [[František Rint]], a woodcarver, was employed by the [[House of Schwarzenberg|Schwarzenberg]] family to put the bone heaps into order, yielding a [[macabre]] result. The signature of Rint, also executed in bone, appears on the wall near the entrance to the chapel.

==In media==
In 1970, the centenary of Rint's contributions, Czech filmmaker [[Jan Švankmajer]] was commissioned to document the ossuary. The result was a 10-minute-long frantic-cut film of skeletal images overdubbed with an actual tour-guide's neutral voice narration. This version was initially banned by the Czech Communist authorities for alleged [[subversion]], and the soundtrack was replaced by a brief spoken introduction and a [[jazz]] arrangement by [[Zdeněk Liška]] of the [[poem]] "Comment dessiner le portrait d'un oiseau" ("How to Draw the Portrait of a Bird") by [[Jacques Prévert]]. Since the [[Velvet Revolution]], the original tour guide soundtrack has been made available.

In the documentary ''[[Long Way Round]]'', [[Ewan McGregor]] and [[Charley Boorman]] stop to see this church. [[Dan Cruickshank]] also views the church in his ''[[Dan Cruickshank's Adventures in Architecture|Adventures in Architecture]]''.

The ossuary is a major plot device in the [[John Connolly (author)|John Connolly]] novel ''The Black Angel''.

The ossuary is used as a location for the [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons (film)|''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' movie]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=My Czech Republic|url=http://www.myczechrepublic.com/czech_culture/filming_locations.html|publisher=My Czech Republic|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the movie ''[[Blood &amp; Chocolate (film)|Blood &amp; Chocolate]]''.

The ossuary was also featured in ''[[Ripley's Believe it or Not]]'' and is described by [[Cara Seymour]] in the final scene of the film ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation.]]''

The ossuary was also the influence for Dr. Satan's lair in the [[Rob Zombie]] film ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jan Strusiewicz|first=Cezary|title=The 6 Creepiest Places on Earth|url=http://www.cracked.com/article/181_the-6-creepiest-places-earth_p2/|publisher=Cracked.com|accessdate=12 July 2012|date=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24782">'''Sensory deprivation''' or '''perceptual isolation'''&lt;ref&gt;Donald Olding Hebb, Essay on Mind, Psychological Press, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; is the deliberate reduction or removal of [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] from one or more of the senses. Simple devices such as [[blindfold]]s or [[Hood (headgear)|hoods]] and [[earmuff]]s can cut off sight and hearing, while more complex devices can also cut off the sense of smell, touch, taste, thermoception (heat-sense), and 'gravity'. Sensory deprivation has been used in various [[alternative medicine]]s and in [[psychology|psychological]] experiments (e.g. with an [[isolation tank]]).

Short-term sessions of sensory deprivation are described as relaxing and conducive to [[meditation]]; however, extended or forced sensory deprivation can result in extreme [[anxiety]], [[hallucination]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sireteanu | first1 = R | last2 = Oertel | first2 = V | last3 = Mohr | first3 = H | last4 = Linden | first4 = D | last5 = Singer | first5 = W | year = 2008 | title = Graphical illustration and functional neuroimaging of visual hallucinations during prolonged blindfolding: A comparison to visual imagery | url = | journal = Perception | volume = 37 | issue = 12| pages = 1805–1821 | doi = 10.1068/p6034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; bizarre [[thought]]s, temporary senselessness, and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Grassian [http://www.prisoncommission.org/statements/grassian_stuart_long.pdf  Psychiatric effects of solitary confinement](PDF) This article is a redacted, non-institution- and non-inmate-specific version of a declaration submitted in September 1993 in Madrid v.

A related [[phenomenon]] is perceptual deprivation, also called the [[Ganzfeld effect]]. In this case a constant uniform stimulus is used instead of attempting to remove the stimuli; this leads to effects which have similarities to sensory deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wackermann|first=J|author2=Pütz P |author3=Allefeld C |title=Ganzfeld-induced hallucinatory experience, its phenomenology and cerebral electrophysiology|journal=Cortex|date=Jun 2008|pmid=18621366|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2007.05.003|volume=44|issue=10|pages=1364–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensory deprivation techniques were developed by some of the armed forces within [[NATO]], as a means of interrogating prisoners within international treaty obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Jeffery |first=Keith |year=1985 |title=The Divided province: the troubles in Northern Ireland, 1969-1985 |edition=illustrated |publisher=Orbis |isbn=0-85613-799-5 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the use of the five techniques by [[United Kingdom|British]] security forces in [[Northern Ireland]] amounted to a practice of [[inhumane]] and degrading treatment.

==Restricted environmental stimulation therapy (REST)==
There are two basic methods of restricted environmental stimulation therapy (REST): chamber REST and flotation REST.

===Chamber REST===
In chamber REST, the subject lies on a bed in a completely dark and sound-reducing (on average, 80&amp;nbsp;dB) room for up to 24 hours. Their movement is restricted by the experimental instructions, but not by any mechanical restraints. Food, drink, and toilet facilities are provided in the room and are at the discretion of the tester, who can communicate with the participants using an open intercom. Subjects are allowed to leave the room before the 24 hours are complete; however, fewer than 10% actually do because they find the chamber so relaxing.&lt;ref name=suedREST&gt;{{cite journal

| journal     = The International Journal of the Addictions
| volume      = 14
| pages       = 861–888
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chamber REST affects psychological functioning (thinking, perception, memory, motivation, and mood) and psychophysiological processes.

===Flotation REST===
{{main|Isolation tank}}
[[Image:Flotation tank SMC.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Flotation tank with flip top lid opened]]
In flotation REST, the room contains a tank or pool. The flotation medium consists of a skin-temperature solution of water and [[Epsom salts]] at a specific gravity that allows for the patient to float supine without worry of safety. In fact, to turn over while in the solution requires "major deliberate effort." Fewer than 5% of the subjects tested leave before the session duration ends, which is usually around an hour for flotation REST.&lt;ref name=suedREST/&gt;

For the first 40 minutes, it is reportedly possible to experience itching in various parts of the body (a phenomenon also reported to be common during the early stages of meditation). The last 20 minutes often end with a transition from beta or alpha [[Neural oscillation|brain waves]] to theta, which typically occur briefly before sleep and again at waking. In a float tank, the theta state can last for several minutes without the subject losing consciousness. Some use the extended theta state as a tool for enhanced [[creativity]] and [[problem solving]]. [[Spa]]s sometimes provide commercial float tanks for use in relaxation. Flotation therapy has been academically studied in the US and in Sweden with published results showing reductions of both pain and stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kjellgren | first1 = A | last2 = Sundequist | first2 = U | display-authors = etal   | year = | title = Effects of flotation-REST on muscle tension pain | url = | journal = Pain Research and Management | volume = 6 | issue = 4| pages = 181–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relaxed state also involves lowered blood pressure, lowered levels of [[cortisol]], and maximal [[Hemodynamics|blood flow]]. Apart from physiological effects, REST seems to have positive effects on well-being and performance.&lt;ref&gt;Dirk van Dierendonck &amp; Jan Te Nijenhuis- Flotation restricted environmental stimulation therapy (REST) as a stress- management tool: A meta-analysis&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chamber versus flotation REST===
Several differences exist between flotation and chamber REST. For example, with the presence of a medium in flotation REST, the subject has reduced tactile stimulation while experiencing weightlessness. The addition of Epsom salts to attain the desired specific gravity may have a therapeutic effect on [[hypertonic]] muscles. Since one of the main results of chamber REST is a state of relaxation, the effects of chamber REST on arousal are less clear-cut, which can be attributed to the nature of the solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| journal     = Imagination, Cognition and Personality
| volume      = 5
| pages       = 219–230
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, due to the inherent immobilization that is experienced in flotation REST (by not being able to roll over), which can become uncomfortable after several hours, the subject is unable to experience the session durations of chamber REST. This may not allow the subject to experience the changes in attitudes and thinking that are associated with chamber REST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| pages       = 33–39
| pmid        = 1778683
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, the research questions asked between each technique are different. Chamber REST questions stemmed from research that began in the 1950s and explored a variety of questions about the need for stimulation, nature of arousal and its relationship with external stimulation. Practitioners in this area have explored its utility in the treatment of major psychiatric dysfunctions such as substance abuse. On the contrary, flotation REST was seen as more of a recreational tool as it was tested more for its use with stress-related disorders, pain reduction and insomnia.&lt;ref name="suedREST"/&gt;

Numerous studies have debated which method is a more effective treatment process, however, only one has explored this statistically. Nineteen subjects, all of whom used chamber or flotation REST to induce relaxation or treat [[smoking]], [[obesity]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] intake or chronic pain were analyzed. The statistic of interest, d, is a measure of the size of the treatment effect. For reference, d=0.5 is considered a moderate effect and d=0.8 a large effect. The 19 subjects who underwent chamber REST had d=0.53 and six flotation REST subjects showed d=0.33. Additionally, when examining subjects undergoing REST treatment and REST in conjunction with another treatment method, there was little difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| last2        = Coren
| first2        = Stanley
}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Flotation REST has the advantage of a lower duration required (45 minutes as opposed to 24 hours).

==Other uses==
The use of REST has been explored in aiding in the cessation of smoking. In studies ranging between 12 months and five years, 25% of REST patients achieved long-term abstinence. REST, when combined with other effective smoking cessation methods (for example: [[behavior modification]]) resulted in long-term abstinence of 50%. Also, when combined with weekly support groups, REST resulted in 80% of patients achieving long-term abstinence. Comparatively, the use of a [[nicotine patch]] alone has a success rate of 5%.&lt;ref name="smoking"&gt;{{cite journal

| volume  = 12
| issue   = 3
| pages   = 263–267
| pmid    = 3310529
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alcoholism]] has also been the target of research associated with REST. In conjunction with anti-alcohol educational messages, patients who underwent two hours of REST treatment reduced alcohol consumption by 56% in the first two weeks after treatment. The reduction in consumption was maintained during follow-ups conducted three and six months after the first treatment. It is, however, possible that this is caused by the [[Placebo|placebo effect]].

In addition, REST has been tested to determine its effect on users of other drugs. A University of Arizona study used chamber REST as a complement to traditional outpatient substance abuse treatment and found that four years later, 43% of the patients were still sober and drug-free. Eight months later, no one in the control group remained clean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychedelic effects===
Studies have been conducted to test the effect of sensory deprivation on the brain. One study took 19 volunteers, all of whom tested in the lower and upper 20th percentiles on a questionnaire which measures the tendency of healthy people to see things not really there, and placed them in a pitch-black, soundproof booth for 15 minutes, after which they completed another test that measures [[psychosis]]-like experiences, originally used to study recreational drug users. Five subjects reported seeing [[hallucination]]s of faces; six reported seeing shapes/faces not actually there; four noted a heightened sense of smell, and two reported sensing a "presence of evil" in the room. People who scored lower on the first test experienced fewer perceptual distortions; however, they still reported seeing a variety of hallucinations.
Many studies have been conducted to understand the main causes of the hallucinations, and considerable evidence has been accumulated indicating that long periods of isolation aren't directly related to the level of experienced hallucinations. &lt;ref&gt;Marvin Zuckerman &amp; Nathan Cohen (1964). Sources of Reports of Visual Auditory Sensations in perceptual-isolation experiments.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schizophrenics appear to tend to experience fewer  hallucinations while in REST as compared to non-psychotic individuals. A possible explanation for this could be that non-psychotic individuals are normally exposed to a greater degree of sensory stimulation in everyday life, and in REST, the brain attempts to re-create a similar level of stimulation, producing the hallucinatory events.&lt;ref&gt;From drugs to deprivation: a Bayesian framework for understanding models of psychosis&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a 2009 study published in the ''[[Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease]],'' the hallucinations are caused by the brain misidentifying the source of what it is currently experiencing, a phenomenon called [[faulty source monitoring]].&lt;ref name="negativesense"&gt;{{cite journal
| doi        = 10.1097/NMD.0b013e3181b9760b

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A study conducted on individuals who underwent REST while under the effects of Phencyclidine (PCP) showed a lower incidence of hallucination in comparison to participants who did not take PCP. The effects of PCP also appeared to be reduced while undergoing REST. The effects PCP has on reducing occurrences of hallucinatory events provides a potential insight into the mechanisms behind these events.&lt;ref&gt;From drugs to deprivation: a Bayesian framework for understanding models of psychosis&lt;/ref&gt; 

===The five sensory deprivation techniques===
{{Main|five techniques}}

The five techniques of ''wall-standing; hooding; subjection to noise; deprivation of sleep; deprivation of food and drink'' were used by the security forces in [[Northern Ireland]] in the early 1970s. After the Parker Report of 1972, these techniques were formally abandoned by the United Kingdom as aids to the [[interrogation]] of paramilitary suspects.

The Irish government on behalf of the men who had been subject to the five methods took a case to the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] (''Ireland v. United Kingdom'', 1976 Y.B. Eur. Conv. on Hum. Rts. 512, 748, 788-94 (European Commission of Human Rights)). The Commission stated that it "considered the combined use of the five methods to amount to torture."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070629145037/http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/prohibits_torture.htm Security Detainees/Enemy Combatants: U.S. Law Prohibits Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment] Footnote 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Weissbrodt ''[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/intlhr/chapter19.doc materials on torture and other ill-treatment: 3. European Court of Human Rights]'' (doc) [http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:u7wX9dL11d4J:www1.umn.edu/humanrts/intlhr/chapter19.doc&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2&amp;lr=lang_en html]: Ireland v. United Kingdom, 1976 Y.B. European Convention on Human Rights. 512, 748, 788-94 (European Commission of Human Rights)&lt;/ref&gt; This consideration was overturned on appeal, when in 1978 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) examined the [[United Nations]]' definition of torture. The court subsequently ruled that the five techniques "did not occasion suffering of the particular intensity and cruelty implied by the word torture," however they did amount "to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment," which is a breach of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], [[Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 3]].&lt;ref name="Ireland.v.UK_167"&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57506 Ireland v. the United Kingdom (1978)], paragraph 167&lt;/ref&gt;

It their judgment&lt;ref name="Ireland.v.UK_96"&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57506 Ireland v. the United Kingdom (1978)], paragraph 96&lt;/ref&gt; the court states that:
:These methods, sometimes termed "disorientation" or "sensory deprivation" techniques, were not used in any cases other than the fourteen so indicated above.  It emerges from the [[European Commission of Human Rights|Commission's]] establishment of the facts that the techniques consisted of:''
::(a) wall-standing: forcing the detainees to remain for periods of some hours in a [[stress position]], described by those who underwent it as being "spreadeagled against the wall, with their fingers put high above the head against the wall, the legs spread apart and the feet back, causing them to stand on their toes with the weight of the body mainly on the fingers";
::(b) hooding: putting a black or navy colored bag over the detainees' heads and, at least initially, keeping it there all the time except during interrogation;
::(c) subjection to noise: pending their interrogations, holding the detainees in a room where there was a continuous loud and hissing noise;
::(d) deprivation of sleep: pending their interrogations, depriving the detainees of sleep
::(e) deprivation of food and drink: subjecting the detainees to a reduced diet during their stay at the center and pending interrogations.

[[José Padilla (prisoner)|José Padilla]], a [[United States citizen]] from [[Brooklyn, New York]], was convicted in federal court of aiding [[Terrorism|terrorists]] in 2007 and was sentenced to 17 years and 4 months in prison. While awaiting trial, reports surfaced that, to persuade him to reveal information, he was subjected to sensory deprivation for weeks at a time. For 1,307 days, Padilla was kept in a 9' x 7' cell with no natural light, clock or calendar. When Padilla left his cell, he was shackled and fitted with heavy goggles and headphones. His counsel argues that while he was being interrogated Padilla was subjected to harsh lights and pounding sounds. While meeting with his counsel, they reported Padilla exhibiting facial tics, random eye movements and unusual contortions of his body. According to them, Padilla had become so "shattered" that he became convinced his lawyers were part of a continuing interrogation program and saw his captors as protectors.&lt;ref name="negativesense"/&gt;

==="Total Isolation"===
In January 2008, the [[BBC]] aired a ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' special entitled "Total Isolation". The premise of the show centered on six individuals, four men and two women, agreeing to be shut in a cell inside a nuclear bunker, alone and in complete darkness for 48 hours. Prior to isolation, the volunteers underwent tests of [[visual memory]], [[information processing]], [[Verbal fluency test|verbal fluency]] and [[suggestibility]].

After the two days and two nights, the subjects noted that their inability to sense time, as well as hallucinations, made the experience difficult. Of the six volunteers, three experienced auditory and visual hallucinations—snakes, oysters, tiny cars and zebras. One was convinced their sheets were wet. Two seemed to cope well.

When complete, the tests that the subjects took before the experiment were conducted a second time to test its effects. The results indicated all volunteers' ability to complete the simplest tasks had deteriorated. One subject's memory capacity fell 36% and all the subjects had trouble thinking of words beginning with a nominated letter; in this case, the letter "F". All four of the men had markedly increased suggestibility, although this was not the case with the women.&lt;ref name="total"&gt;{{Cite video

"It's really hard to stimulate your brain with no light. It's blanking me. I can feel my brain just not wanting to do anything."

'''''Sensus divinitatis''''' ("sense of divinity"), also referred to as ''sensus deitatis'' ("sense of deity") or ''semen religionis'' ("seed of religion"), is a term first used by French Protestant reformer [[John Calvin]] to describe a hypothetical human sense. Instead of knowledge of the environment (as with, for example, smell or sight), the ''sensus divinitatis'' is alleged to give humans a knowledge of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Helm | first=Paul | year=1998 | title=John Calvin, the Sensus Divinitatis, and the noetic effects of sin | journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion | volume=43 | issue=2 | pages=87–107 | doi=10.1023/A:1003174629151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Calvin's view, there is no reasonable non-belief. [[Neo-Calvinism|Neo-Calvinists]] who adhere to the [[presuppositional apologetics|presuppositionalist]] school of [[Christian apologetics]] sometimes appeal to a ''sensus divinitatis'' to argue that there are no genuine [[atheism|atheists]]:

{{quote|That there exists in the human mind and indeed by natural instinct, some sense of Deity [''sensus divinitatis''], we hold to be beyond dispute, since God himself, to prevent any man from pretending ignorance, has endued all men with some idea of his Godhead…. …this is not a doctrine which is first learned at school, but one as to which every man is, from the womb, his own master; one which nature herself allows no individual to forget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Institutes of the Christian Religion|last=Calvin|first=Jean|publisher=Westminster/John Knox Press,U.S.|ISBN=0-664-22028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Analytic philosophy|Analytic philosopher]] [[Alvin Plantinga]] of the [[University of Notre Dame]] posits a modified form of the ''sensus divinitatis'' whereby all have the sense, only it does not work properly in some humans, due to sin's [[nous|noetic]] effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alvin|last=Plantinga|title=Warranted Christian Belief|ISBN=0-19-513192-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Reformed epistemology]])

[[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], the 18th-century American Calvinist preacher and theologian, claimed that while every human being has been granted the capacity to know God, successful use of these capacities requires an attitude of "true benevolence".

==Criticism==

Philosopher Steven Maitzen claimed in 2006 that the [[demographics]] of religious belief make the existence of the ''sensus divinitatis'' unlikely, as this sense appears so unevenly distributed.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal| last = Maitzen| first = Steven | title = Divine hiddenness and the demographics of theism| journal = Religious Studies| volume = 42| pages = 177–191| publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2006| url = http://philosophy.acadiau.ca/tl_files/sites/philosophy/resources/documents/Maitzen_Hiddenness.pdf| doi = 10.1017/S0034412506008274| accessdate =2012-01-26 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Maitzen may{{according to whom|date=October 2013}} have confused [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]'s ''sensus dei''{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} with ''sensus divinitatis''—''sensus divinitatis'' (a religious sense) only necessitates a core religious/faith component to one's beliefs, whereas the ''sensus dei'' aims at a natural knowledge of God—compare ''In the Twilight of Western Thought'' by [[Herman Dooyeweerd]] (1894–1977).&lt;ref&gt;

Australian '''Stanley Keith Pearl''' was a [[sapper]] with the [[First Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I]]. His exact dates of birth and death are unclear. After enlisting at the town of [[Ulverstone]] in [[Tasmania]] on 9 November 1915 at twenty-one years of age, Pearl, in August 1916, became a sapper with the Australian 5 Field Company Engineers.&lt;ref name=Saunders2016&gt;Nicholas J. Saunders, "Sapper Stanley Keith Pearl," in ''Sappers &amp; Shrapnel: Contemporary Art and the Art of the Trenches'', Lisa Slade (Adelaide: Art Gallery of South Australia, 2016), 15. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Embarkation&gt;Australian War Memorial, [https://www.awm.gov.au/people/rolls/R1778164/ "First World War Embarkation Rolls: Stanley Keith Pearl"], ''[[Australian War Memorial]]'', n.d., accessed 5 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slade2015&gt;Lisa Slade, "Trench Art: Sappers and Shrapnel – on Trench Art and Material Culture in Contemporary Art," ''Art &amp; War: Badlands'', in ''Artlink'' 35, no. 1 (March 2015), n.p. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neale2016&gt;Kerry Neale, [https://www.awm.gov.au/blog/2016/04/28/decoration-destruction-first-world-war-trench-art-sapper-pearl/ "Decoration from Destruction: the First World War Trench Art of Sapper Pearl"], ''[[Australian War Memorial]]'', 28 April 2016, accessed 5 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He performed this role for the duration of the war.&lt;ref name=Saunders2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Slade2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neale2016 /&gt; Many details on Pearl himself remain a mystery. A consideration of the phenomenal [[trench art]] collection that he produced, however, helps to piece together essential information about him.

== World War I ==

Pearl was a [[joiner]] by trade whose father was Charles Pearl of Ulverstone, Tasmania.&lt;ref name=Embarkation /&gt; Pearl was Anglican.&lt;ref name=Embarkation /&gt; He embarked from Sydney to Alexandria and then the [[Western Front (World War I)]] in France aboard HMAT ''Orsova'' on 11 March 1916.&lt;ref name=Saunders2016 /&gt; He undertook a brief stint with the 8 Field Company Engineers (Reinforcement 4) before joining the 5 Field Company Engineers.&lt;ref name=Neale2016 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Australian Imperial Force (AIF) Project, [https://www.aif.adfa.edu.au/showPerson?pid=237003 "Stanley Keith Pearl"], (n.d.) ''[[University of New South Wales (UNSW) Canberra, Australian Defence Force Academy]]'', accessed 29 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl’s [[Victory Medal (United Kingdom)]] and [[British War Medal]] are held in the Australian War Memorial’s collection.&lt;ref&gt;Australian War Memorial collection, [https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/REL/21088.002 "Victory Medal: Sapper S K Pearl, 5 Field Company Engineers, AIF"], accessed 29 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Australian War Memorial collection, [https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/REL/21088.001 "British War Medal 1914-20: Sapper S K Pearl, 5 Field Company Engineers, AIF"], accessed 29 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pearl produced a phenomenal collection of trench art between 1916 and 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl donated his trench art objects to the [[Australian War Memorial]] but whether this reflects the full extent of that which he produced in the context of war remains a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016, p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neale2016 /&gt; A total of fifteen of Pearl’s [[Work of art|oeuvre]] are held in the Australian War Memorial’s Military Heraldry collection.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AWMConline&gt;Australian War Memorial collection, [https://www.awm.gov.au/search/all/?query=sapper+stanley+keith+pearl&amp;submit=&amp;op=Search&amp;format=list&amp;section%5B0%5D=collections "Collections search: Sapper Stanley Keith Pearl"], accessed 4 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Military shell cases, other parts of shells, badges and buttons were just some of the war-related materials used by Pearl to assemble everyday objects such as a clock, a map of Tasmania and a hat pin stand, as is evidenced by the accessibility and digitisation of his work on the War Memorial’s online collection (see external links for selection of images).&lt;ref name=AWMConline /&gt; One can become more familiar with Pearl’s work through such a collection as it displays images of the objects together with Pearl’s own field notes. The accompanying field notes that Pearl documented alongside each piece are fascinating as this was not a feature typically associated with First World War trench art.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl used matter-of-fact language where tales of death became mere descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016, p.22, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl’s field notes and his details on the First World War embarkation roll are useful additional [[primary source]]s for [[historian]]s, [[art historian]]s and [[anthropologist]]s.

==Post-war and legacy==

There is no evidence to suggest that Pearl is survived by anyone, nor have any photographs of him been discovered.&lt;ref name=Mitzevich2016&gt; Nick Mitzevich, "Director’s Foreword," in ''Sappers &amp; Shrapnel: Contemporary Art and the Art of the Trenches'', Lisa Slade (Adelaide: Art Gallery of South Australia, 2016), 8. &lt;/ref&gt; He is an "enigma." &lt;ref name=Mitzevich2016 /&gt; It is therefore Pearl’s material existence in the form of trench art that survives, the power of which is subsequently elevated. The creative and artistic vision of Pearl to contribute to the [[material culture]] of World War I, of which trench art is a fascinating example, has meant that his name lives on through these well-crafted, striking objects.&lt;ref name=Saunders2000&gt;Nicholas J. Saunders, "Bodies of Metal, Shells of Memory: ‘Trench Art’, and the Great War Re-cycled," ''Journal of Material Culture'' 5, no. 1 (2000), 45. &lt;/ref&gt; Pearl was unconsciously engaging with features of material culture such as [[bricolage]] and recyclia in producing trench art.&lt;ref&gt; Corinne A. Kratz, "Rethinking Recyclia," ''African Arts'' 28, no. 3 (Summer 1995), 7, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2000, p.45.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that he was a joiner pre-war also speaks to this refined, craftsmanship-like quality to his pieces.

Pearl survived World War I. During March of 1919, Pearl returned to Tasmania, although soon relocated to Canberra.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; He began working for the Australian War Memorial in 1941, the year that it opened, and continued to do so until he retired.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neale2016 /&gt; He worked as a carpenter and senior tradesman at the War Memorial.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders 2016, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neale2016 /&gt; The electoral roll details Pearl’s exact position at the War Memorial as an ‘installation manager.’&lt;ref name=Neale2016 /&gt; Such hands-on employment echoes his pre-war occupation as a joiner.

A recent exhibition entitled ''Sappers &amp; Shrapnel: Contemporary Art and the Art of the Trenches'' at the [[Art Gallery of South Australia]] showcased Pearl’s trench art. The exhibition presented Pearl’s pieces alongside other First World War trench art objects and more recent works of art that reflected on war today. Such a display, in bringing together the historical and the contemporary, was the first opportunity whereby the trench art of Pearl was exposed to a wider audience.&lt;ref name=Mitzevich2016 /&gt; It is evidence that Pearl and his trench art collection hold an important relevance today and will continue to do so in the future, especially in studies of [[history]], [[art history]] and [[anthropology]].

The '''Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine''' ('''SNOMED''') is a systematic, computer-processable collection of [[medical terms]], in human and [[veterinary medicine]], to provide codes, terms, synonyms and definitions which cover [[anatomy]], [[diseases]], findings, procedures, [[microorganisms]], substances, etc. It allows a consistent way to index, store, retrieve, and aggregate medical data across specialties and sites of care. Although now international, SNOMED was started in the [[United States|U.S.]] by the [[College of American Pathologists]] (CAP)&lt;ref name=Design/&gt; in 1973 and revised into the 1990s. In 2002 CAP's SNOMED Reference Terminology (SNOMED RT) was merged with, and expanded by, the [[National Health Service]]'s Clinical Terms Version 3 (previously known as the [[Read codes]]) to produce SNOMED CT.&lt;ref name="NLM-UMLS-add"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/snomed_announcement.html |title=SNOMED Clinical Terms To Be Added To UMLS Metathesaurus |publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] |date=24 May 2006 |accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NLM-SNOMED-FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/snomed_faq.html |title=FAQs: SNOMED CT in the UMLS |publisher=United States National Library of Medicine |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Versions of SNOMED released prior to 2001 were based on a multiaxial, [[hierarchical]] classification system.&lt;ref name=Design&gt;{{cite journal | author = Roger A. Côté |year=1986| title=Architecture of SNOMED|journal=Proceedings of the Annual Symposium on Computer Application in Medical Care|pages=74–80|pmc=2245000}}
&lt;/ref&gt; As in any such system, a disease may be located in a body [[organ (anatomy)]], which results in a code in a topography axis and may lead to [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] alterations represented by a morphology code.

In 2002 the first release of [[SNOMED CT]] adopted a completely different structure. A sub-type hierarchy, supported by defining relationships based on description logic, replaced the axes described in this article. Versions of SNOMED prior to SNOMED CT are planned to be formally deprecated from 2017.&lt;ref name=Deprecate&gt;[http://www.ihtsdo.org/snomed-ct/history0/ Deprecation of Antecedent Versions of SNOMED by IHTSDO General Assembly]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, readers interested in current information about SNOMED are directed to the article on [[SNOMED CT]].

==Purpose==
SNOMED was designed as a comprehensive [[nomenclature]] of clinical medicine for the purpose of accurately storing and/or retrieving records of clinical care in human and [[veterinary medicine]].
The metaphor used by [[Roger A. Côté]], the first editorial chair, was that SNOMED would become the [[periodic table of elements]] of medicine because of its definitional organization beyond the hierarchical design.  Indeed, diseases and procedures were ordered hierarchically and are further referenced back to more elementary terms (see Reference Ontology and Multi-Axial Design, below).

==History==
SNOMED was originally conceived by Côté as an extension of the design of the Systematized Nomenclature of Pathology (SNOP) applicable for all medicine. SNOP was originally designed by Arnold Pratt to describe pathological specimens according to their morphology and anatomy (topography). The ambitious development of SNOMED required many more axes (see multi-axial design, below). SNOMED was jointly proposed for development to the [[College of American Pathologists]] by Côté and Pratt. The former was appointed as editorial chair of the Committee on Nomenclature and Classification of Diseases of the CAP and developed the SNOMED from 1973 to 1997. In 1998,  [[Kent Spackman]] was appointed to chair this committee and spearheaded the transformation of the multi-axis systems into a highly computable form (See [[SNOMED CT]]): a [[directed acyclic graph]] anchored in formal representation logic. In 2007, the newly formed [[International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation]] ([[IHTSDO]]) acquired all the Intellectual Property of [[SNOMED CT]] and all antecedent SNOMED versions.

Brief timeline:
* 1965 SNOP
* 1974 SNOMED
* 1979 SNOMED II
* 1993 SNOMED International 3.0
* 1995 [[SNOMED Microglossary of Signs and Symptoms]]
* 1993-98 SNOMED International versions 3.1-3.5
* 2002 First release of [[SNOMED CT]]
* 2007 All versions of SNOMED acquired by [[IHTSDO]]
* 2017 All SNOMED versions except [[SNOMED CT]] will be formally deprecated by [[IHTSDO]]

==Reference ontology==
SNOMED was designed from its inception with complex concepts defined in terms of simpler ones. For example, a disease can be defined in terms of its abnormal anatomy, abnormal functions and [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. In some cases, the [[etiology]] of the disease is known and can be attributed to an infectious agent, a physical trauma or a chemical or pharmaceutical agent.

==Multi-axial design==

The current concept uses eleven (11) axes that comprise terms organised in hierarchical trees. The axes and some examples are provided below:

=== T (Topography) &amp;ndash; Anatomic terms===

* (T-28000) [[Lung]]
* (T-32000) [[Heart]]
* (T-51000) [[Mouth]]
* (T-D2500) [[Hip]]
* (T-D9600) [[Heel]]

=== M (Morphology) &amp;ndash; Changes found in cells, tissues and organs===
* (M-40000) [[Inflammation]]
* (M-44000) [[Granuloma]]
* (M-54700) [[Infarcted]]
* (M-54701) [[Microscopic infarct]]

''For the Morphology axis, SNOMED has [http://www.snomed.org/clinical/anatomic.html agreed] to collaborate and use the same harmonized codes shared with  [[International Classification of Diseases for Oncology]]. Additional examples on topology are provided on that page.''

=== L (Living organisms) &amp;ndash; Bacteria and viruses===
* (L-21801) [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]
* (L-25116) [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]

=== C (Chemical) &amp;ndash; Drugs===
* (C-C137A) [[Bufferin]] [[Analgesic]] [[Tablet (pharmacy)|Tablets]]
* (C-C137B) [[Bufferin]] [[Analgesic]] [[Tablet (pharmacy)#Caplet|Caplets]]

=== F (Function) &amp;ndash; Signs and symptoms===
* (F-03003) [[Fever]]

=== J (Occupation) &amp;ndash; Terms that describe the occupation===
* Kindergarten teacher (13420)
* Computer programmer (08420)
* Doctor (06105)
* Professional Nurse (General) (07110)
* Beautician (57040)

=== D (Diagnosis) &amp;ndash; Diagnostic terms===
* (D-13510) [[Pneumococcal pneumonia]]
* (D-14800) [[Tuberculosis]]
* (D3-15000) [[Myocardial infarction]]

=== P (Procedure) &amp;ndash; Administrative, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures===

=== A (Physical agents, forces, activities) &amp;ndash; Devices and activities associated with the disease===

=== S (Social context) &amp;ndash; Social conditions and important relationships in medicine===
* (S-10120) [[Mother]]

=== G (General) &amp;ndash; Syntactic linkages and qualifiers===

A '''term''' is a period of [[wikt:duration|duration]], [[time]] or [[wikt:occurrence|occurrence]], in relation to an [[Phenomenon|event]]. To differentiate an [[Interval (time)|interval]] or duration, common phrases are used to distinguish the observance of [[length]] are near-term or short-term, medium-term or mid-term and long-term.

It is also used as part of a [[calendar]] [[year]], especially one of the three parts of an [[academic term]] and [[employment|working]] year in the [[United Kingdom]]: [[Michaelmas term]], [[Hilary term]] / [[Lent term]] or [[Trinity term]] / [[Easter term]], the equivalent to the [[Academic term#United States|American semester]]. In [[United States|America]] there is a [[United States midterm election|midterm election]] held in the middle of the four-year presidential term, there are also academic [[midterm exam]]s.

In '''[[economics]]''', it is the period required for economic agents to reallocate resources, and generally reestablish [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. The actual length of this period, usually numbered in years or decades, varies widely depending on circumstantial context. During the long term, all factors are variable.

In '''[[finance]]''' or financial operations of borrowing and investing, what is considered ''long-term'' is usually above 3 years, with ''medium-term'' usually between 1 and 3 years and ''short-term'' usually under 1 year.  It is also used in some countries to indicate a fixed term investment such as a [[term deposit]].

In law, the term of a [[contract]] is the duration for which it is to remain in effect (not to be confused with the meaning of "term" that denotes any [[contractual term|provision of a contract]]). A [[fixed-term contract]] is one concluded for a pre-defined time.

==Other terms==

'''The Flying Grass Carpet''' is a huge rug entirely made of [[artificial grass]]. It travels around the world, as a temporary landscape. It's intended as space to play on and enjoy, but can also be used for picnics, open-air festivals and sports .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flying carpet, or pop-up pasture?|url=http://springwise.com/lifestyle_leisure/flying_carpet_or_pop-up_pastur/?format=print|work=Lifestyle &amp; Leisure|publisher=www.springwise.com|accessdate=27 October 2010|date=9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The designers of The Flying Grass Carpet live in [[Rotterdam]], a city known for its designers and [[architects]]. The designers of the Flying Grass Carpet are fond of cities and city-life but are concerned about the loss of quality of the public space in a lot of cities. To make a positive gesture they created The Flying Grass Carpet.

The Flying Grass Carpet travels to different places around the world, and stays in the different locations for a short period of time.  It's intended to function as an actual park, allowing people to enjoy all the activities they can normally only enjoy in the park, in the middle of the city. The Flying Grass Carpet is also intended to connect different cities and their citizens with each other, and create what its designers call a "worldwide shared public domain".  [[Image:Tfgctech.jpg|thumb|alt=A''[[Technical Details]]''.]]

==Technical details==
The carpet contains several types and colors of grass. It weighs 6375 kilograms (6.5&amp;nbsp;kg per square meter). The size of the carpet is adjustable, and can be up to 25 by 36 meters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flyinggrasscarpet.org/tech.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award==
The Flying Grass Carpet won a '[[Dutch Design Award]]' in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dutch design awards|url=http://www.dutchdesignawards.nl/nl/hall_of_fame/2009/&amp;id=589|accessdate=27 October 2010|date=9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}
'''Transference''' ({{lang-de|Übertragung}}) is a theoretical phenomenon characterized by unconscious redirection of the feelings a person has about a second person to feelings the first person has about a third person. It usually concerns feelings from an important second-person relationship from childhood, and is sometimes considered inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Kapelovitz | first = Leonard H. | title = To Love and To Work/A Demonstration and Discussion of Psychotherapy | year = 1987 | page = 66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary (8th ed. 1976).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language (2nd College Ed. 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; Transference was first described by [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], who considered it an important part of psychoanalytic treatment.

== Occurrence ==
It is common for people to transfer feelings from their parents to their partners or children (that is, cross-generational entanglements). For instance, one could mistrust somebody who resembles an ex-spouse in manners, voice, or external appearance, or be overly compliant to someone who resembles a childhood friend.

In ''The Psychology of the Transference'', [[Carl Jung]] states that within the transference [[dyad (sociology)|dyad]] both participants typically experience a variety of opposites, that in love and in psychological growth, the key to success is the ability to endure the tension of the opposites without abandoning the process, and that this tension allows one to grow and to transform.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Jung|Jung, Carl C.]] ''The Psychology of the Transference'', Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-01752-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only in a personally or socially harmful context can transference be described as a pathological issue. A modern, social-cognitive perspective on transference explains how it can occur in everyday life. When people meet a new person who reminds them of someone else, they unconsciously infer that the new person has traits similar to the person previously known.&lt;ref name="soccogtrans"&gt;Andersen, S. M. &amp; Berk., M. (1998). The social-cognitive model of transference: Experiencing past relationships in the present. ''Current Directions in Psychological Science, 7(4)'', 109-115.&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective has generated a wealth of research that illuminated how people tend to repeat relationship patterns from the past in the present.

High-profile serial killers often transfer unresolved rage toward previous love or hate-objects onto "surrogates", or individuals resembling or otherwise calling to mind the original object of that hate. It is believed in the instance of [[Ted Bundy]], he repeatedly killed brunette women who reminded him of a previous girlfriend with whom he had become infatuated, but who had ended the relationship, leaving Bundy rejected and pathologically rageful (Bundy, however, denied this as a motivating factor in his crimes).&lt;ref&gt;"Michaels, S. G., &amp; Aynesworth, H. (2000). ''Ted Bundy: Conversations with a killer'', Dallas: Authorlink.&lt;/ref&gt; This notwithstanding, Bundy's behavior could be considered pathological insofar as he may have had [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] or [[antisocial personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Describing Ted Bundy’s Personality and Working towards DSM-V. Douglas B. Samuel and Thomas A. Widiger. Department of Psychology at the University of Kentucky.Independent Practitioner (2007), 27 (1), pp. 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; If so, normal transference mechanisms cannot be held causative of his homicidal behavior.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

[[Sigmund Freud]] held that transference plays a large role in male homosexuality. In ''The Ego and the Id'', he claimed that eroticism between males can be an outcome of a "[psychically] non-economic" hostility, which is unconsciously subverted into love and sexual attraction.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1960). ''The ego and the id''. J. Strachey (Ed.). (J. Riviere, Trans.). New York: W.W. Norton. (Original work published 1923)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transference and countertransference during psychotherapy ==
In a therapy context, transference refers to redirection of a patient's feelings for a significant person to the therapist. Transference is often manifested as an erotic attraction towards a therapist, but can be seen in many other forms such as rage, hatred, mistrust, [[parentification]], extreme dependence, or even placing the therapist in a god-like or guru status.  When Freud initially encountered transference in his therapy with patients, he thought he was encountering patient resistance, as he recognized the phenomenon when a patient refused to participate in a session of [[Free association (psychology)|free association]]. But what he learned was that the analysis of the transference was actually the work that needed to be done: "the transference, which, whether affectionate or hostile, seemed in every case to constitute the greatest threat to the treatment, becomes its best tool".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; The focus in [[psychodynamic psychotherapy]] is, in large part, the therapist and patient recognizing the transference relationship and exploring the relationship's meaning.  Since the transference between patient and therapist happens on an unconscious level, psychodynamic therapists who are largely concerned with a patient's unconscious material use the transference to reveal unresolved conflicts patients have with childhood figures.

[[Countertransference]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Horacio Etchegoyen]]: ''The Fundamentals of Psychoanalytic Technique'', Karnac Books ed., New Ed, 2005, {{ISBN|1-85575-455-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
is defined as redirection of a therapist's feelings toward a patient, or more generally, as a therapist's emotional entanglement with a patient.  A therapist's attunement to their own countertransference is nearly as critical as understanding the transference.  Not only does this help therapists regulate their emotions in the [[therapeutic relationship]], but it also gives therapists valuable insight into what patients are attempting to elicit in them.  For example, a therapist who is sexually attracted to a patient must understand the countertransference aspect (if any) of the attraction, and look at how the patient might be eliciting this attraction. Once any countertransference aspect has been identified, the therapist can ask the patient what his or her feelings are toward the therapist, and can explore how those feelings relate to unconscious motivations, desires, or fears.

Another contrasting perspective on transference and countertransference is offered in [[classical Adlerian psychotherapy]].  Rather than using the patient's transference strategically in therapy, the positive or [[negative transference]] is diplomatically pointed out and explained as an obstacle to cooperation and improvement.  For the therapist, any signs of countertransference would suggest that his or her own personal [[training analysis (psychotherapy)|training analysis]] needs to be continued to overcome these tendencies.  Andrea Celenza noted in 2010 that "the use of the analyst's countertransference remains a point of controversy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Celenza|first=Andrea|date=October 2010|title=The guilty pleasure of erotic countertransference: searching for radial true|journal=Studies in Gender and Sexuality|volume=11|issue=4|pages=175–183|doi=10.1080/15240657.2010.513222|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

"'''Two Concepts of Liberty'''" was the inaugural [[lecture]] delivered by the liberal philosopher [[Isaiah Berlin]] before the [[University of Oxford]] on 31 October 1958. It was subsequently published as a 57-page pamphlet by Oxford at the [[Clarendon Press]]. It also appears in the collection of Berlin's papers entitled ''Four Essays on Liberty'' (1969) and was more recently reissued in a collection entitled simply ''Liberty'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Four Essays on Liberty, Oxford University Press, 1969. Superseded by Liberty.&lt;/ref&gt;

The essay, with its analytical approach to the definition of political concepts, re-introduced the study of political philosophy to the methods of [[analytic philosophy]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} It is also one of Berlin's first expressions of his ethical ontology of [[value-pluralism]]. Berlin defined negative liberty (as the term "liberty" was used by [[Thomas Hobbes]] &lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', page 170&lt;/ref&gt;) as the absence of coercion or interference with agents' possible private actions, by an exterior social-body. He also defined it as a comparatively recent political ideal, which re-emerged in the late 17th century, after its slow and inarticulate birth in the Ancient doctrines of [[Antiphon (person)|Antiphon the Sophist]], the [[Cyrenaics|Cyrenaic discipleship]], and of [[Otanes]] after the death of [[Bardiya|pseudo-Smerdis]].&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', page 33&lt;/ref&gt; In an introduction to the essay, Berlin writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"As for Otanes, he wished neither to rule nor to be ruled—the exact opposite of Aristotle's notion of true civic liberty. ... [This ideal] remains isolated and, until Epicurus, undeveloped ... the notion had not explicitly emerged".&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', ''Five Essays on Liberty: An Introduction'', page 33-4&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Summary ==

=== Positive liberty ===
:"is involved in the answer to the question 'What, or who, is the source of control or interference that can determine someone to do, or be, this rather than that?' The two questions are clearly different, even though the answers to them may overlap."&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, I: "Two Concepts of Liberty",1958&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Positive liberty]] may be understood as self-mastery, and includes one's having a role in choosing who governs the society of which one is a part.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Berlin traced positive liberty from Aristotle's definition of citizenship, which is historically derived from the social role of the freemen of classical Athens: it was, Berlin argued, the liberty in choosing their government granted to citizens, and extolled, most famously, by [[Pericles]]. Berlin granted that both concepts of liberty represent valid human ideals, and that both forms of liberty are necessary in any free and civilised society.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== Negative liberty ===
:"liberty in the negative sense involves an answer to the question: 'What is the area within which the subject—a person or group of persons—is or should be left to do or be what he is able to do or be, without interference by other persons'."&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, I: "Two Concepts of Liberty",1958&lt;/ref&gt;

For Berlin, [[negative liberty]] represents a different, and sometimes contradictory, understanding of the concept of liberty, which needs to be carefully examined. Its later proponents (such as [[Tocqueville]], [[Benjamin Constant|Constant]], [[Montesquieu]], [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]] and [[John Stuart Mill]],{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} who accepted [[Chrysippus]]' understanding of [[self-determination]])&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', page 171 and 260&lt;/ref&gt; insisted that constraint and discipline were the antithesis of liberty and so were (and are) less prone to confusing liberty and constraint in the manner of rationalists and the philosophical harbingers of totalitarianism.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} This concept of negative liberty, Berlin argued, constitutes an alternative, and sometimes even opposed, concept to positive liberty, and one often closer to the intuitive modern usage of the word.  Berlin considered negative liberty one of the distinguishing concepts of modern liberalism and observed
:"The fathers of liberalism--Mill and Constant--want more than this minimum: they demand a maximum degree of non-interference compatible with the minimum demands of social life. It seems unlikely that this extreme demand for liberty has ever been made by any but a small minority of highly civilized and self-conscious human beings."&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, I: "Two Concepts of Liberty",1958&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abuse of positive liberty ===
Isaiah Berlin notes that historically positive liberty has proven particularly susceptible to rhetorical abuse; especially from the 18th century onwards, it has either been paternalistically re-drawn from the third-person, or conflated with the concept of negative liberty and thus disguised underlying value-conflicts.

Berlin contended that under the influence of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[G. W. F. Hegel]], modern political thinkers often conflated positive liberty with rational action, based upon a rational knowledge to which, it is argued, only a certain elite or social group has access.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Bern, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', page 257&lt;/ref&gt; This rationalist conflation was open to political abuses, which encroached on negative liberty, when such interpretations of positive liberty were, in the nineteenth century, used to defend nationalism, paternalism, social engineering, historicism, and collective rational control over human destiny. Berlin argued that, following this line of thought, demands for freedom paradoxically could become demands for forms of collective control and discipline—those deemed necessary for the "self-mastery" or "self-determination" of nations, classes, democratic communities, and even humanity as a whole. There is thus an elective affinity, for Berlin, between positive liberty, when it is rhetorically conflated with goals imposed from the third-person that the individual is told they "should" rationally desire, and the justifications for political [[totalitarianism]], which contrary to [[value-pluralism]], presupposed that values exist in [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] harmony. {{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Dialectic of positive and negative liberty ===
Berlin did not argue that the concept of positive liberty should be rejected—on the contrary, he recognised it as one human value among many, and one necessary to any free society.&lt;ref&gt;Four Essays on Liberty, Oxford University Press, 1969. Superseded by Liberty.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that positive liberty was a genuine and valuable version of liberty, so long as it was identified with the autonomy of individuals, and not with the achievement of goals that individuals 'ought to' 'rationally' desire.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', p 39&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin argued, rather, that these differing concepts showed the plurality, and incompatibility of human values, and the need to analytically distinguish and trade-off between, rather than conflate, them.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', page 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Berlin offers in his "Two Concepts of Liberty" essay, "Where it is to be drawn is a matter of argument, indeed of haggling. Men are largely interdependent, and no man's activity is so completely private as never to obstruct the lives of others in any way. 'Freedom for the pike is death for the minnows'; the liberty of some must depend on the restraint of others. Freedom for an Oxford don, others have been known to add, is a very different thing from freedom for an Egyptian peasant."

The '''Uhehe fiscal''' (''Lanius collaris marwitzi'') is a [[bird]] in the [[Laniidae]] family.  It is [[Endemism|endemic]] to the uplands of southern and eastern [[Tanzania]]. Some taxonomic authorities treat this species as a [[subspecies]] of the [[southern fiscal]] (''Lanius collaris''). Despite its small population size and restricted range, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] has rated this species as being of "[[Least-concern species|least concern]]".

==Description==
The Uhehe fiscal is a slender, black and white bird growing to about {{convert|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar. The upper parts are dull black, with a white [[supercilium]] and white scapulars. The back, rump and upper tail coverts are dark grey, and the long tail is black. All the tail feathers except the two central ones have white spots. The wings are black except for a small white patch. The underparts are whitish, sometimes washed with buff. It could be confused with the southern fiscal, but its colouration is distinctly darker and it occurs at higher elevations.&lt;ref name=Lefranc&gt;{{cite book|author1=Norbert Lefranc |author2=Tim Worfolk |title=Shrikes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HclLAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159 |year=2013 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=978-1-4081-8756-2 |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
Little is known of the habits and ecology of this species, but they are likely to be similar to those of the southern fiscal. It seems to be a shy and rather quiet bird.&lt;ref name=Lefranc/&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
The Uhehe fiscal is found only in southern and eastern Tanzania at elevations of above {{convert|1500|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, from [[Mpwapwa]] and the [[Ukaguru Mountains]] to [[Njombe]], [[Mount Rungwe]] and [[Tukuyu]]. Its typical habitat is scrubland.&lt;ref name=Lefranc/&gt;

==Status==
The Uhehe fiscal has a total population of fewer than 10,000 breeding pairs and a restricted range, but there is no evidence of any substantial decline in numbers of birds, so the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] has assessed its conservation status as being of "[[Least-concern species|least concern]]".&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

[[File:Wall of Kindness, Dasappa Circle, Mysore.jpg|thumb|Wall of Kindness, Mysore, India. ]]
The '''wall of kindness''' ({{lang-fa|دیوار مهربانی}} ''dīvār-e mehrabānī''; {{lang-ur|دیوار مہربانی}} ''Dewar e meherbani'') is a [[Charity (practice)|charity]] work phenomenon and a kind of [[Altruism|welfare]], usually done by attaching cloth hangers from outside of houses; those encourage people to donate miscellaneous useful things such as winter clothing. It was introduced by an anonymous [[Iran]]ian,&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=kindness|first1=walls of|title=Iranians spontaneously created 'walls of kindness' to help the homeless|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-35132157|accessdate=1 January 2016|work=BBC Trending|agency=BBC|issue=What's popular and why|publisher=BBC UK|date=20 December 2015|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the practice quickly spread throughout the country. The motto of the movement are two sentences which appear on the walls: "leave if you do not need" ({{lang|fa|نیاز نداری بگذار}}) and "take [it] if you need" ({{lang|fa|نیاز داری بردار}}).&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/14/irans-walls-of-kindness-offer-help-to-the-homeless#img-1|title=Iran's 'walls of kindness' offer help to the homeless|first=Saeed Kamali|last=Dehghan|date=14 January 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

Initially started for the [[Homelessness|homeless]] people of the [[Mashhad]], Iran, the act serves a purpose to support the people in need. In response to social media, large numbers of people are taking part as a campaign and it has helped many homeless or otherwise destitute people during the cold winter weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://images.dawn.com/news/1174670|title=The wall of kindness: An Iranian venture to feed the poor comes to Pakistan|first=Zoya|last=Anwer|date=25 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2016/02/07/449021/Pakistan-happiness|title=PressTV- Wall of Kindness spreads happiness in Pakistan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wall of kindness was seen in [[Pakistan]]'s [[Karachi]] on 15 January 2016 and another one in [[China]]'s [[Liuzhou]], located in  [[Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region]] on 29 January 2016. Also students of [[Marymount International School of Rome]], in April 2016, have reproduced the idea by designating a wall with similar function and name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.cri.cn/12394/2016/01/29/4202s915117.htm|title=Wall of Kindness Seen in South China|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Xinhua|title=China Exclusive: "Wall of Kindness" provides warmth in wintry China|url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/Off_the_Wire/2016-02/01/content_37711388.htm|accessdate=9 February 2016|agency=China.org.cn|date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wall of kindness was set up in Peshawar by Serve Mankind &amp; Wadaan and afterwards it started Spreading all over Pakistan such as, [[Rawalpindi]], [[Lahore]], [[Sialkot]], [[Quetta]], [[Khuzdar]] and [[Karachi]] have witnessed similar walls where people are leaving clothes and other essential items for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/31906/have-you-visited-the-wall-of-kindness-in-karachi/|title=Have you visited the Wall of Kindness in Karachi?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kamal Siddiqi|title=Walls of kindness|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1042116/walls-of-kindness/|accessdate=9 February 2016|agency=The Express Tribune|date=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amina Khan|first1=Asad Ali Lodhi|title=The wall of kindness: Pavement goes from sex corner to charity spot|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1041533/the-wall-of-kindness-pavement-goes-from-sex-corner-to-charity-spot/|accessdate=9 February 2016|agency=The Express Tribune|date=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tara Kangarlou|title=Iranians warm up winter with ‘kindness walls’|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/12/25/iranians-warm-upwinterwithkindnesswalls.html|accessdate=9 February 2016|agency=Al Jazeera America|date=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=INP|title=‘Wall of Kindness’ appears in Lahore|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/national/08-Feb-2016/wall-of-kindness-appears-in-lahore|accessdate=9 February 2016|agency=Daily Times Pakistan|date=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Javed Aziz Khan|title=‘Wall of Kindness’ helps poor get warm clothes|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/print/95687-Wall-of-Kindness-helps-poor-get-warm-clothes|accessdate=9 February 2016|agency=THE NEWS INTERNATIONAL|date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wall of Kindness: Helping the poor while challenging stereotypes|url=http://nation.com.pk/featured/02-Feb-2016/wall-of-kindness-helping-the-poor-while-challenging-stereotypes|accessdate=9 February 2016|agency=The Nation|publisher=Nawaiwaqt Group of Newspapers|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;


A new Wall of Kindness was recently witnessed in Amman/Jordan at the Landmark Amman Hotel on November 21st, 2017, which marked the first day of rain, inviting generous souls including children to donate clothes anonymously for the most in need ahead of the winter season. After donations are received, the laundry team at the hotel picks up the clothes, cleans them, irons them, wraps them up and hangs them back so they are available for the recipients, just like brand new items.   @landmarkAmman



Similar walls known as "Neki ki Deewar" have sprung up in multiple cities across India such as [[Allahabad]], [[Bhilwara]], [[Jhalawar]], [[Mysore]], [[Chandigarh|Chandigrah]], [[Bhopal]], [[Dehradun]], [[Korba, Chhattisgarh|Korba]] and [[Kolkata]] sometimes even having more supply than demand of clothes. The walls are also serving unexpected purpose of keeping walls clean and free from spitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/neki-ki-deewar-turns-santa-claus-for-the-needy-across-india/story-Bfm7UtYxXRovfEg1Ze19yH.html|title=‘Neki ki Deewar’ turns Santa Claus for the needy across India|date=2016-12-25|newspaper=Hindustan Times|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/wall-of-kindness-bring-warmth-and-happiness-to-needy-people-in-bhopal/story-yD6hgrBwac9RHAvqPioWqI.html|title=‘Wall of kindness’ bring warmth and happiness to needy people in Bhopal|date=2016-09-18|newspaper=Hindustan Times|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millenniumpost.in/NewsContent.aspx?NID=349791|title=Wall of Kindness: Helping without boasting|website=Millennium Post|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/wall-of-kindness-bring-warmth-and-happiness-to-needy-people-in-bhopal/story-yD6hgrBwac9RHAvqPioWqI.html|title=‘Wall of kindness’ bring warmth and happiness to needy people in Bhopal|date=2016-09-18|newspaper=Hindustan Times|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170210/jsp/saltlake/story_134883.jsp |title= Wall reaches discarded stuff to needy|date=2017-10-10|newspaper= https://www.telegraphindia.com/ /|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The [[economy of Iran]] was hit when sanctions were imposed by the [[Western World]]. As the situation became worse, with an increasing number of unemployed, many could not afford clothes. Inflation caused particular difficulties for those in need. In the winter of 2015, young Iranians in Sajjad Boulevard in Mashhad came up with the idea. The main theme was to meet the demand for resources from charities. For the first time, a wall symbolizes unity rather than separation and the community has been asked to donate voluntarily. As soon as the attempt came to the attention of various social and mass media platforms, it was supported and praised by citizens as well as netizens.

Young Iranians took the chance to strengthen the bonds of community. The campaign went smoothly despite the risk of misuse and loss of resources. People were responsive and well aware of the fact that most vulnerable should get priority.
 
Winter clothing disbursed among mass number of people as a welfare had been seen before,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=concerned to reach blankets|title=Reach winter clothes to cold-hit areas swiftly: PM|url=http://www.bssnews.net/newsDetails.php?cat=0&amp;id=455096&amp;date=2014-12-13|accessdate=13 February 2016|agency=BSS|date=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but still, the idea was innovative and showed much intelligence.

==Impact ==
The sharing works of charity had a great impacts of religious point of view regarding [[Islamic]] country like Iran. Like in other religions, charitable work is considered a virtue in Islam, which has driven people to do more for humanity. Like in Iran, people in Pakistan are showing their humanity via this initiative.
