      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4573">'''Acrotomophilia''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀκρότομος "having the top cut off" (from ἄκρον ''akron'' "extremity" and -τομος ''-tomos'' from τέμνω ''temno'' "I cut") and φιλία ''philia'' "love") is a [[paraphilia]] in which an individual expresses strong sexual interest in [[amputee]]s. It is a counterpart to ''[[apotemnophilia]]'', the sexual interest in ''being'' an amputee.

==Overview==
Acrotomophiles may be attracted to [[amputee]]s because they like the way they look or they may view the amputee’s stump as a [[phallic]] object which can be used for [[sexual pleasure]]. Acrotomophiles may enjoy the idea of dominating the amputee during couples play and they may also become aroused with the thought of having to take care of an [[amputee]].

==Interests and behaviours==
In a survey of acrotomophiles, leg amputations were preferred over arm amputations, amputations of a single limb over double amputations, and amputations that left a stump over amputations that left no stump.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, D. (1983). An erotic attraction to amputees. ''Sexuality and Disability, 6,'' 3–19.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Solvang (2007), “Devotees adhere to standard conceptions of attractiveness in all other matters outside of amputations.”&lt;ref&gt;Solvang, P. (2007). The amputee body desired: Beauty destabilized? Disability re-valued? ''Sexuality and Disability, 25,'' 51–64.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Jung]]ian explanation for the fetish is that it stems from a desire to resolve discontinuities in the collective subconscious by means of distorting the geometric representation of man, which traditionally involves five points, six when focusing on male sexuality, and seven when discussing incarnations of the Logos from certain religious cultures.

==Ethical issues==
Some people question whether amputating one's own body parts or operating on a partner for the sake of sexual pleasure is ethical. For some, modifying the body is a private ritual of self-ownership and freedom of choice. Psychiatrists may make a diagnosis of [[Body integrity identity disorder]] (B.I.I.D.).&lt;ref&gt;Robin Marantz Henig. (March 22, 2005) [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/22/health/psychology/22ampu.html At War With Their Bodies, They Seek to Sever Limbs]. [[The New York Times]]. Retrieved: 2008.02.08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;fleshbot.com (March 22, 2005) [http://www.fleshbot.com/sex/found/devotees-pretenders-and-wannabes-036808.php Devotees, Pretenders and Wannabes.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223070910/http://www.fleshbot.com/sex/found/devotees-pretenders-and-wannabes-036808.php |date=February 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
The term ''amelotatism'' has also been used to describe acrotomophilia.  The sexual interest in ''being'' an amputee is ''[[apotemnophilia]]''.&lt;ref name=money&gt;[[John Money]], Kent W. Simcoe. 1984. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/k731445740p1g7q8/ Sexuality and Disability Journal. "Acrotomophilia, sex and disability: New concepts and case report".]  Springer Netherlands. ISSN 0146-1044 (Print) 1573-6717 (Online).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Janice M. Irvine]]. (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=uIJXT7ZCTCsC&amp;pg=PA4 Disorders of Desire: Sexuality And Gender In Modern American Sexology]. {{ISBN|1-59213-151-4}}. (p. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; John Money (1977) used the terms ''autoapotemnophilia'' and ''alloapotemnophilia'' to describe the erotic interest of wanting to be or appear as an amputee versus wanting amputees as sexual partners;&lt;ref&gt;Money, J., Jobaris, R., &amp; Furth, G. (1977). Apotemnophilia: Two cases of self demand amputation as a sexual preference. ''The Journal of Sex Research, 13'', 115–124.&lt;/ref&gt; neither term has been widely used since. The term ''teratophilia'' is used to describe arousal from deformed or monstrous people.&lt;ref name = Aggrawal2008&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNkNhPZQprcC&amp;pg=PA381&amp;dq=Teratophilia&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=Teratophilia | title=Forensic and Medico-Legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices | last=Aggrawal | first=Anil | authorlink=Anil Aggrawal | publisher=[[CRC Press]] | year=2008 | ISBN=1-4200-4308-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[automation]] production technology the actions performed by an automated process are executed by a program of instructions which is run during a work cycle. To execute work cycle programs, an automated system should be available to execute these  advanced functions.

==Safety monitoring==
If there is a need for workers in an automated system, a safety monitoring is required for the [[occupational safety and health]] of the workers. In a safety monitoring various steps can take place including a complete stop of the system, sounding an alarm or reducing the operating speed. Usually, limiting switches are [[sensor]]s like temperature probes, heat and smoke detectors or pressure sensitive floor pads.

==Maintenance and repair diagnostics==
There are three modes of operations which are used in a cycle of [[Condition-based maintenance|maintenance]] and repair diagnostics: status monitoring, failure diagnostics and recommendation of the repair procedure. In the status monitoring mode, the current system status is displayed. The failure diagnostics mode takes place when a failure occurs. The system will then suggest an adequate repair procedure to a team of experts.

==Error detection and recovery==
The error detection mode is a step to determine if and when a failure occurs in automated system. The possible errors can be divided into three categories. random errors, systematic errors and aberrations. While in the  error recovery mode, remedy actions take place for all detected errors.

'''Astroinformatics''' is an interdisciplinary field of study involving the combination of [[astronomy]], [[data science]], [[informatics]], and [[Information technology|information]]/[[Communications technologies|communications]] technologies.&lt;ref name="astroinfo" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pdf&gt;[http://www.math.bas.bg/~nkirov/zip/SEEDI_astro_presentation.pdf Astroinformatics and digitization of astronomical heritage], Nikolay Kirov.

==Background==

Astroinformatics is primarily focused on developing the tools, methods, and applications of [[computational science]], [[data science]], and [[statistics]] for research and education in data-oriented astronomy.&lt;ref name="astroinfo"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borne |first1=Kirk D. |title=Astroinformatics: data-oriented astronomy research and education |journal=Earth Science Informatics |date=12 May 2010 |volume=3 |issue=1–2 |pages=5–17 |doi=10.1007/s12145-010-0055-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early efforts in this direction included [[data exploration|data discovery]], [[metadata standards]] development, [[data modeling]], astronomical [[data dictionary]] development, [[data access]], [[information retrieval]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Science User Scenarios for a Virtual Observatory Design Reference Mission: Science Requirements for Data Mining|eprint=astro-ph/0008307|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[data integration]], and [[data mining]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Kargupta |editor-first1=Hillol |display-editors=etal |title=Next generation of data mining |date=2008 |location=London |isbn=9781420085860 |last1=Borne |first1=Kirk|chapter=Scientific Data Mining in Astronomy |publisher=CRC Press |pages=91–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the astronomical [[Virtual Observatory]] initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1117/12.487536|chapter=Distributed data mining in the National Virtual Observatory|title=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery: Theory, Tools, and Technology V|volume=5098|pages=211|series=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery: Theory, Tools, and Technology V|year=2003|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VOdm" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laurino |first1=O. |last2=D’Abrusco |first2=R. |last3=Longo |first3=G. |last4=Riccio |first4=G. |title=Astroinformatics of galaxies and quasars: a new general method for photometric redshifts estimation |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |date=21 December 2011 |volume=418 |issue=4 |pages=2165–2195 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.19416.x|arxiv=1107.3160 |bibcode=2011MNRAS.418.2165L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further development of the field, along with astronomy community endorsement, was presented to the [[National Research Council (United States)]] in 2009 in the Astroinformatics "State of the Profession" Position Paper for the 2010 [[Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Astroinformatics: A 21st Century Approach to Astronomy|eprint = 0909.3892 |class=astro-ph.IM|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That position paper provided the basis for the subsequent more detailed exposition of the field in the Informatics Journal paper ''Astroinformatics: Data-Oriented Astronomy Research and Education''.&lt;ref name="astroinfo" /&gt;

Astroinformatics as a distinct field of research was inspired by work in the fields of [[Bioinformatics]] and [[Geoinformatics]], and through the [[eScience]] work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Online Science'|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gray/JimGrayTalks.htm|website=Talks by Jim Gray|publisher=Microsoft Research|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)]] at [[Microsoft Research]], whose legacy was remembered and continued through the Jim Gray eScience Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Gray eScience Award|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/focus/escience/jim-gray-award.aspx|website=Microsoft Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the primary focus of Astroinformatics is on the large worldwide distributed collection of digital astronomical databases, image archives, and research tools, the field recognizes the importance of legacy data sets as well—using modern technologies to preserve and analyze historical astronomical observations. Some Astroinformatics practitioners help to [[Digital data|digitize]] historical and recent astronomical observations and images in a large [[database]] for efficient retrieval through [[World wide web|web]]-based interfaces.&lt;ref name=pdf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casca.ca/lrp2010/Docs/LRPReports/astroinformatics_lrp.pdf Astroinformatics in Canada], Nicholas M. Ball, David Schade. Retrieved 1 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Another aim is to help develop new methods and software for astronomers, as well as to help facilitate the process and analysis of the rapidly growing amount of data in the field of astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Astroinformatics' helps Astronomers explore the sky|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-10-astroinformatics-astronomers-exploring-sky.html|website=Phys.org|publisher=Heidelberg University|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astroinformatics is described as the "Fourth Paradigm" of astronomical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fourth Paradigm: Data-Intensive Scientific Discovery|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/fourth-paradigm-data-intensive-scientific-discovery/|website=Microsoft Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many research areas involved with astroinformatics, such as data mining, machine learning, statistics, visualization, scientific data management, and semantic science.&lt;ref name="VOdm"&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5618-2_9|chapter=Virtual Observatories, Data Mining, and Astroinformatics|title=Planets, Stars and Stellar Systems|pages=403|year=2013|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|isbn=978-94-007-5617-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Data mining]] and [[machine learning]] play significant roles in Astroinformatics as a [[Scientific method|scientific research]] discipline due to their focus on "knowledge discovery from data" ([[data mining|KDD]]) and "learning from data".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ball |first1=N.M. |last2=Brunner |first2=R.J. |title=Data Mining and Machine Learning in Astronomy |journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D |volume=19 |issue=7 |pages=1049 |doi=10.1142/S0218271810017160 |year=2010|arxiv=0906.2173 |bibcode=2010IJMPD..19.1049B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1063/1.3059074 |chapter=The LSST Data Mining Research Agenda |title=AIP Conference Proceedings |pages=347 |year=2008 |last1=Borne |first1=K |last2=Becla |first2=J |last3=Davidson |first3=I |last4=Szalay |first4=A |last5=Tyson |first5=J. A |last6=Bailer-Jones |first6=Coryn A.L|arxiv=0811.0167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of data collected from astronomical sky surveys has grown from gigabytes to terabytes throughout the past decade and is predicted to grow in the next decade into hundreds of petabytes with the [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope]] and into the exabytes with the [[Square Kilometre Array]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1063/1.3059076|chapter=Parametrization and Classification of 20 Billion LSST Objects: Lessons from SDSS|title=AIP Conference Proceedings|pages=359|year=2008|last1=Ivezić|first1=Ž|last2=Axelrod|first2=T|last3=Becker|first3=A.

A|last21=Bailer-Jones|first21=Coryn A.L|arxiv=0810.5155}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plethora of new data both enables and challenges effective astronomical research. Therefore, new approaches are required. In part due to this, data-driven science is becoming a recognized academic discipline. Consequently, astronomy (and other scientific disciplines) are developing information-intensive and data-intensive sub-disciplines to an extent that these sub-disciplines are now becoming (or have already become) standalone research disciplines and full-fledged academic programs. While many institutes of education do not boast an astroinformatics program, such programs most likely will be developed in the near future.

[[Informatics]] has been recently defined as "the use of digital data, information, and related services for research and knowledge generation". However the usual, or commonly used definition is "informatics is the discipline of organizing, accessing, integrating, and mining data from multiple sources for discovery and decision support." Therefore, the discipline of astroinformatics includes many naturally-related specialties including data modeling, data organization, etc. It may also include transformation and normalization methods for data integration and information visualization, as well as knowledge extraction, indexing techniques, information retrieval and data mining methods. Classification schemes (e.g., [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]], [[ontology (information science)|ontologies]], [[folksonomy|folksonomies]], and/or collaborative [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Collaborative Annotation for Scientific Data Discovery and Reuse|url=http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/Apr-13/AprMay13_RDAP_Borne.html|website=Bulletin of the ASIS&amp;T|publisher=American Society for Information Science and Technology|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) plus [[Astrostatistics]] will also be heavily involved. [[Citizen science]] projects (such as [[Galaxy Zoo]]) also contribute highly valued novelty discovery, feature meta-tagging, and object characterization within large astronomy data sets. All of these specialties enable scientific discovery across varied massive data collections, collaborative research, and data re-use, in both research and learning environments.

In 2012, two position papers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Astroinformatics in a Nutshell|url=https://asaip.psu.edu/Articles/astroinformatics-in-a-nutshell|website=asaip.psu.edu|publisher=The Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics Portal, Penn State University|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feigelson|first1=Eric|title=Astrostatistics in a Nutshell|url=https://asaip.psu.edu/Articles/astrostatistics-in-a-nutshell|website=asaip.psu.edu|publisher=The Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics Portal, Penn State University|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; were presented to the Council of the [[American Astronomical Society]] that led to the establishment of formal working groups in Astroinformatics and [[Astrostatistics]] for the profession of [[astronomy]] within the US and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Feigelson|first1=E.|last2=Ivezić|first2=Ž.|last3=Hilbe|first3=J.|last4=Borne|first4=K.|title=New Organizations to Support Astroinformatics and Astrostatistics|eprint=1301.3069|class=astro-ph.IM|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astroinformatics provides a natural context for the integration of education and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=The Revolution in Astronomy Education: Data Science for the Masses|eprint = 0909.3895 |class=astro-ph.IM|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of research can now be implemented within the classroom to establish and grow [[data literacy]] through the easy re-use of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Data in the Classroom|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/usingdata/index.html|website=Science Education Resource Center at Carleton College|publisher=National Science Digital Library|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has many other uses, such as repurposing archival data for new projects, literature-data links, intelligent retrieval of information, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Astroinformatics: Data-Oriented Astronomy|location=George Mason University, USA|url=http://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2009/PosterPapers/Poster-paper18.pdf|accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AutoChem''' is [[NASA]] release software{{clarify|date=August 2013}} that constitutes an automatic computer code generator and documenter for chemically reactive systems&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasatech.com/Briefs/Nov05/GSC_14862_1.html&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[David Lary]] between 1993 and the present. It was designed  primarily for modeling [[atmospheric chemistry]], and in particular, for chemical [[data assimilation]].

The user selects a set of chemical species. AutoChem then searches [[chemical reaction]] databases for these species and automatically constructs the [[ordinary differential equations]] (ODE) that describe the chemical system. AutoChem symbolically [[Derivative|differentiates]] the time derivatives to give the [[Jacobian matrix]], and symbolically differentiates the Jacobian matrix to give the [[Hessian matrix]] and the adjoint. The Jacobian matrix is required by many [[algorithms]] that solve the [[ordinary differential equations]] numerically, particular when the ODEs are stiff. The Hessian matrix and the adjoint are required for four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var). AutoChem documents the whole process in a set of [[LaTeX]] and [[PDF]] files.

The reactions involving the user specified constituents are extracted by the first AutoChem preprocessor program called Pick. This subset of reactions is then used by the second AutoChem preprocessor program RoC (rate of change) to generate the time derivatives, Jacobian, and Hessian. Once the two preprocessor programs have run to completion all the [[Fortran 90]] code has been generated that is necessary for modeling and assimilating the kinetic processes.

A huge observational [[database]] of many different atmospheric constituents from a host of platforms are available from the AutoChem site.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.science-softcon.de/autochem/constituentobservationaldatabase.html&lt;/ref&gt;

AutoChem has been used to perform long term chemical data assimilation of atmospheric chemistry. This assimilation was automatically documented by the AutoChem software and is available on line at CDACentral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdacentral.info/ |accessdate=2017-04-24 | title= Welcome to CDA Central |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717223237/http://www.cdacentral.info/ |archivedate=July 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Data quality is always an issue for chemical data assimilation, in particular the presence of biases. To identify and understand the biases it is useful to compare observations using [[probability distribution function]]s. Such an analysis is available on line at PDFCentral which was designed for the validation of observations from the NASA [[Aura (satellite)|Aura satellite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdfcentral.info/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223072036/http://www.pdfcentral.info/ |title=PDF Central |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 23, 2007 |accessdate=2017-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Berman Jewish DataBank''', founded as the '''North American Jewish Data Bank''', is the central online source for social scientific studies of North American Jewry and world Jewish populations and communities. The DataBank’s primary functions are to acquire and archive materials from quantitative studies of North American Jews, including data sets and reports, and to encourage and aid the production and utilization of quantitative research on North American Jews.

The DataBank maintains partnerships with the [[Berman Jewish Policy Archive]] and the [[University of Connecticut]]’s Center for Judaic Studies and Contemporary Jewish Life.

The DataBank holds more than 375 surveys and studies of North American Jews, including more than 200 local community studies usually commissioned by local [[The Jewish Federations of North America|Jewish federations]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishdatabank.org/About/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for the DataBank comes from an endowment provided by the [[Mandell and Madeleine Berman Foundation]] and from [[The Jewish Federations of North America]] (JFNA), and management is provided by JFNA. The DataBank’s professional staff includes Laurence Kotler-Berkowtiz, Director of the Berman Jewish DataBank; [[Ron Miller (sociologist)|Ron Miller]], Senior Research Consultant at the  Berman Jewish DataBank; and [[Arnold Dashefsky]], Director Emeritus and Senior Academic Consultant of the Berman Jewish DataBank.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishdatabank.org/About/staff.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berman Jewish DataBank was founded as the North American Jewish Data Bank in 1986 and operated under that name until July 2013.  Funded throughout that time by the Berman Foundation under an arrangement with the Jewish Federation system, the North American Jewish Data Bank was located at the City University of New York from 1986 until 2002, at Brandeis University (2003-04) and the University of Connecticut (2004-2013) before moving to JFNA and changing names as of July 2013.

The '''Progressive Artists' Group''', PAG, was a group of [[modern art]]ists, mainly based in [[Mumbai|Bombay]], from its formation in 1947. Though it lacked any particular style, there might be said to have been a move towards a synthesis of influences from Indian art history together with styles prevalent in Europe and North America during the first half of the 20th Century, including [[Post-Impressionist|Post-Impressionism]], [[Cubist|Cubism]] and [[Expressionistic|Expressionism]].

==History==
The Progressive Artists' Group was formed by six founder members, [[F. N. Souza]], [[S. H. Raza]],  [[M. F. Husain]], [[K. H. Ara]], [[H. A. Gade]], and [[S. K. Bakre]] (the only sculptor in the group). Others associated with the group included [[Manishi Dey]], [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], [[Akbar Padamsee]] and [[Tyeb Mehta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngmaindia.gov.in/sh-pag.asp National Gallery of Modern Art]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The group wished to break with the revivalist nationalism established by the [[Bengal school of art]] and to encourage an Indian avant-garde, engaged at an international level.  The Group was formed just months after the 14 August 1947 "Partition of India" and Pakistan that resulted in religious rioting and death of tens of thousands of people displaced by the new borders. The founders of the Progressive Artists Group often cite "the partition" as impetus for their desire for new standards in India, starting with their new style of art.&lt;ref&gt;Ratan Parimoo and Nalini Bhagwat: Progressive Artists Group of Bombay: An Overview over The Spirit of Late 1940s and Early 1950s [http://www.artnewsnviews.com/view-article.php?article=progressive-artists-group-of-bombay-an-overview&amp;iid=29&amp;articleid=800]&lt;/ref&gt;  Their intention was to "paint with absolute freedom for content and technique, almost anarchic, save that we are governed by one or two sound elemental and eternal laws, of aesthetic order, plastic co-ordination and colour composition."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saffronart.com/sitepages/ArticleDetails.aspx?Articleid=9&amp;pageno=1 Overview of India Art: Progressive Artists Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, [[Vasudeo S. Gaitonde]], [[Prafulla Dahanukar]], [[Krishen Khanna]] and [[Mohan Samant]] joined the Group. Following the departure of the two main founders Souza and Raza from India few years later, S.K. Bakre also left the group, which ultimately disbanded in 1956.

European [[Modernism]] was the most distinctive influence on the group, but its members worked in dramatically different styles, from the Expressionism of Souza to the pure abstraction of Gaitonde. Specific Indian imagery and landscapes were also adopted, particularly by Mehta and Husain. Through the incorporation and mixture of new, abstract styles with traditional Indian art elements and Media, the PAG is one of the most influential art movements in India until today. 
In 2015, F.N. Souza's painting "Birth" set a new record for Indian art with a hammer price above US$ 4 Mio, which shows the worldwide appeal of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/souzas-birth-sets-new-record-sells-for-4-m-at-christies/138070/ | title=Souza’s ‘Birth’ sets new record, sold for $4 m at Christie’s | newspaper=Financial Express | date=19 September 2015 | accessdate=9 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CALPUFF''' is an advanced, integrated [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Lagrangian puff]] modeling system for the simulation of [[atmospheric pollution dispersion]] distributed by the Atmospheric Studies Group at TRC Solutions.&lt;ref name=Cleanair&gt;[http://www.cleanairinfo.com/regionalstatelocalmodelingworkshop/documents/CALPUFF.pdf CALPUFF Status and Update]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is maintained by the model developers and distributed by TRC.
The model has been adopted by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) in its ''Guideline on Air Quality Models'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/scram001/guidance/guide/appw_03.pdf Appendix W] of 40 [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (CFR) Part 51&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[List of atmospheric dispersion models#Preferred and recommended models|preferred model]] for assessing long range transport of pollutants and their impacts on Federal Class I areas and on a case-by-case basis for certain near-field applications involving complex meteorological conditions.

The integrated modeling system consists of three main components and a set of preprocessing and postprocessing programs. The main components of the modeling system are CALMET (a diagnostic 3-dimensional [[meteorological]] model), CALPUFF (an [[air dispersion modeling|air quality dispersion model]]), and CALPOST (a postprocessing package). Each of these programs has a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). In addition to these components, there are numerous other processors that may be used to prepare geophysical (land use and terrain) data in many standard formats, meteorological data (surface, upper air, precipitation, and buoy data), and interfaces to other models such as the Penn State/[[National Center for Atmospheric Research|NCAR]] Mesoscale Model (MM5), the [[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]] (NCEP) Eta model and the RAMS meteorological model.

The CALPUFF model is designed to simulate the dispersion of buoyant, puff or continuous point and area pollution sources as well as the dispersion of buoyant, continuous line sources. The model also includes [[algorithms]] for handling the effect of downwash by nearby buildings in the path of the pollution plumes.&lt;ref name=CARB&gt;[http://www.ofcm.gov/atd_dir/pdf/calpuff.pdf General and Specific Characteristics of the model] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060806135149/http://www.ofcm.gov/atd_dir/pdf/calpuff.pdf |date=2006-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The CALPUFF model was originally developed by the Sigma Research Corporation (SRC) in the late 1980s under contract with the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB)&lt;ref name=CARB/&gt; and it was first issued in about 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arb.ca.gov/research/apr/past/a025-2a.pdf Model Formulation and Users Guide for the CALPUFF model, May 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sigma Research Corporation subsequently became part of Earth Tech, Inc. After the US EPA designated CALPUFF as a preferred model in their ''Guideline on Air Quality Models'', Earth Tech served as the designated distributor of the model.

In April 2006, ownership of the model switched from Earth Tech to the TRC Environmental Corporation.  More recently ownership transferred to E&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;ponent,&lt;ref&gt;[http://src.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; who are currently (December 2015) responsible for maintaining and distributing the model.&lt;ref name=Cleanair/&gt;

'''Carl Frederick Kraenzel''' (November 1, 1906 – July 26, 1980) was an American [[sociologist]].  Most of Kraenzel’s work focuses on the people of the [[Great Plains]], covering a range of topics including quality of life, power relations, resource use, and mental health. Kraenzel has been widely published in  a variety of professional journals, monographs, research bulletins, special reports and books in the fields of [[rural sociology]], [[Great Plains]] sociology, and natural resource sociology.  His most known work, ''The Great Plains in Transition'' describes the challenges of social life and connections to the natural environments in the North American semiarid region located between the [[98th meridian west|98th meridian]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Born in [[Hebron, North Dakota]], Kraenzel grew up on a farm in the countryside of the Northern Great Plains and witnessed first-hand the challenges of rural life and living in the region.    Kraenzel attended the University of North Dakota for his undergraduate degree, and continued on to do graduate work at the [[University of Minnesota]], [[Harvard University]], and the [[University of Wisconsin]], where he received his Ph.D in 1935. Kraenzel served as a professor of sociology at [[Montana State University]] in [[Bozeman, Montana|Bozeman]] for many years, and later at the [[University of Texas at El Paso]].

'''CLEI''', the '''Centre for the Comparative Analysis of Law and Economics, Economics of Law, Economics of Institutions''' is a research center founded in 2004 by four renowned research universities, [[Cornell University Law School]] (School of Law, John M. Olin Program in Law and Economics), [[Ecole Polytechnique]] (Pole de Recherche en Economie et Gestion), [[University of Turin]] (Dipartimenti di Economia 'S.Cognetti de Martiis', Scienze Economiche e Finanziarie 'G.Prato', Scienze  Giuridiche) and the [[University of Ghent]] (Law School, Centre for Advanced Studies in Law and Economics).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/international/study_abroad/turin.cfm Turin Interuniversity Centre for the Comparative Analysis of Law and Economics, Economics of Law, Economics of Institutions (CLEI)&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the centre has been expanded to include the following partner universities.

* [[Marburg University]]
* [[University of Eastern Piedmont]]
* [[University of Economics, Prague]]
* [[Université Paul Cézanne Aix-Marseille III]]
* [[Panthéon-Assas University]]

==Purpose==

Though the [[law and economics]] movement has continental foundations as well as roots in [[United States|American]] [[jurisprudence]], over the past fifteen years the field has grown to be dominated by the [[University of Chicago|Chicago law and economics school]].  Despite the dominance of the Chicago approach, international scholars have made vast contributions to the field, and to the broader themes of [[legal theory]] surrounding [[law and economics]].  The purpose of the [[CLEI|CLEI Center]] and its IEL (Institutions, Economics, Law) Ph.D. program is to foster an alternative approach to the comparative analysis of law and economics.  To further this mission, the CLEI Centre and the [[Collegio Carlo Alberto]] attract highly qualified economists and legal theorists from around the world to introduce students to alternative traditions in the law and economics movement.&lt;ref&gt;http://iel.carloalberto.org/ Information regarding the IEL Programme at the CLEI Centre&lt;/ref&gt;

The CLEI Centre also sponsors scholarship focusing on empirical analysis of law.&lt;ref&gt;http://iel.carloalberto.org/Research-and-Pubblication/Conferences.aspx Conference on Efficiency and the Judiciary: Law and Economics Perspectives&lt;/ref&gt;

==CLEI/IEL Program==

The centerpiece of CLEI is a three-year [[Ph.D.]] program.  The program is administered by the [[University of Turin]], graduate division.  The [[CLEI|CLEI Center]] also offers a one-year Master's program in Institutions, Economics and Law.&lt;ref&gt;http://iel.carloalberto.org/Overview/Master-IEL.aspx Description of Master's Program&lt;/ref&gt;  The coordinator of the program is Prof. Giovanni B. Ramello.

The Center sponsors conferences, visiting lecturers, and various other [[keynote address]]es.

Speakers at CLEI have included [[Guido Calabresi]], [[Duncan Kennedy (legal philosopher)|Duncan Kennedy]] and [[Ugo Mattei]].

==Location==

The CLEI centre is located in the city of [[Moncalieri]], (a suburb of the province of [[Torino]]) within the historic [[Collegio Carlo Alberto]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13438">'''Computational cognition''' (sometimes referred to as '''computational cognitive science''' or '''computational psychology''') is the study of the [[computation]]al basis of [[education|learning]] and [[inference]] by [[mathematical model]]ing, [[computer simulation]], and [[behaviorism|behavioral]] experiments. In psychology, it is an approach which develops computational models based on experimental results. It seeks to understand the basis behind the human method of [[information processing|processing of information]]. Early on computational cognitive scientists sought to bring back and create a scientific form of [[Franz Brentano|Brentano’s]] psychology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green, C., &amp; Sokal, Michael M.|first=|date=2000|title=Dispelling the "Mystery" of Computational Cognitive Science|url=|journal=History of Psychology|volume=3 | issue = 1 |pages=62–66|via=|doi=10.1037/1093-4510.3.1.62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificial intelligence==
{{Main article|Artificial intelligence}}
There are two main purposes for the productions of artificial intelligence: to produce intelligent behaviors regardless of the quality of the results, and to model after intelligent behaviors found in nature.&lt;ref name="McCorduck"/&gt;  In the beginning of its existence, there was no need for artificial intelligence to emulate the same behavior as human cognition. Until 1960s, economist [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] and [[Allen Newell]] attempted to formalize human problem-solving skills by using the results of psychological studies to develop programs that implement the same problem-solving techniques as people would. Their works laid the foundation for [[Symbolic artificial intelligence|symbolic AI]] and computational cognition, and even some advancements for [[cognitive science]] and [[cognitive psychology]].&lt;ref name="Haugeland"/&gt;

The field of symbolic AI is based on the [[physical symbol systems hypothesis]] by Simon and Newell, which states that expressing aspects of cognitive intelligence can be achieved through the manipulation of [[Physical symbol system|symbols]].&lt;ref name="Crevier"/&gt; However, [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] focused more on the initial purpose of artificial intelligence, which is to breakdown the essence of logical and abstract reasoning regardless of whether or not human employs the same mechanism.&lt;ref name="McCorduck"/&gt;

Over the next decades, the progress made in artificial intelligence started to be focused more on developing logic-based and knowledge-based programs, veering away from the original purpose of symbolic AI. Researchers started to believe that artificial intelligence may never be able to imitate some intricate processes of human cognition like [[Machine perception|perception]] or [[Machine learning|learning]]. A chief failing of AI is not being able to achieve a complete likeness to human cognition due to the lack of emotion and the impossibility of implementing it into an AI. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Megill|first=J.|date=2014|title=Emotion, cognition and artificial intelligence.|url=|journal=Minds And Machines|volume=24 | issue = 2 |pages=189–199|via=|doi=10.1007/s11023-013-9320-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;They began to take a “sub-symbolic” approach to create intelligence without specifically representing that knowledge. This movement led to the emerging discipline of [[computational model]]ing, [[connectionism]], and [[computational intelligence]].&lt;ref name="Crevier"/&gt;

==Computational modeling==
{{Main article|Computational model}}
As it contributes more to the understanding of human cognition than artificial intelligence, computational cognitive modeling emerged from the need to define various cognition functionalities (like motivation, emotion, or perception) by representing them in computational models of mechanisms and processes.&lt;ref name="Sun"/&gt; Computational models study [[complex system]]s through the use of specific algorithms and extensive [[computational resource]]s, or variables, to produce [[computer simulation]].&lt;ref name="Simulations"/&gt; Simulation is achieved by adjusting the variables, changing one alone or even combining them together, to observe the effect on the outcomes. The results help experimenters make predictions about what would happen in the real system if those similar changes were to occur. &lt;ref&gt; Sun, R. (2008). The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology. New York: Cambridge University Press. &lt;/ref&gt;

When computational models attempt to mimic human cognitive functioning, all the details of the function must be known for them to transfer and display properly through the models, allowing researchers to thoroughly understand and test an existing theory because no variables are vague and all variables are modifiable. Consider a [[Atkinson–Shiffrin memory model|model of memory built by Atkinson and Shiffrin in 1968]], it showed how rehearsal leads to long-term memory, where the information being rehearsed would be stored. Despite the advancement it made in revealing the function of memory, this model fails to provide answers to crucial questions like: how much information can be rehearsed at a time? How long does it take for information to transfer from rehearsal to long-term memory? Similarly, other computational models raise more questions about cognition than they answer, making their contributions much less significant for the understanding of human cognition than other cognitive approaches.&lt;ref name="Eysenck"/&gt; An additional shortcoming of computational modeling is its reported lack of objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Restrepo Echavarria|first=R.|date=2009|title=Russell's Structuralism and the Supposed Death of Computational Cognitive Science.|url=|journal=Minds and Machines|volume=19 | issue = 2 |pages=181–197|via=|doi=10.1007/s11023-009-9155-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John Anderson]] in his ACT-R uses the functions of computational models and the findings of cognitive science. Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational is based on the theory that the brain consists of several modules which perform specialized functions separate of each other.&lt;ref name="Eysenck"/&gt; The ACT-R model is classified as a [[Cognitivism (psychology)|symbolic]] approach to cognitive science.&lt;ref name="Polk"/&gt;

==Connectionist network==
{{Main article|Connectionism}}
Another approach which deals more with the semantic content of cognitive science is connectionism or neural network modeling. Connectionism relies on the idea that the brain consists of simple units or nodes and the behavioral response comes primarily from the layers of connections between the nodes and not from the environmental stimulus itself.&lt;ref name="Eysenck"/&gt;

Connectionist network differs from computational modeling specifically because of two functions: [[Neural backpropagation|neural back-propagation]] and [[Parallel processing (psychology)|parallel-processing]]. Neural back-propagation is a method utilized by connectionist network to show evidence of learning. After a connectionist network produce a response, the stimulated results are compared to real-life situational results. The feedback provided by the backward propagation of errors would be used to improve accuracy for the network’s subsequent responses.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; The second function, parallel-processing, stemmed from the belief that knowledge and perception are not limited to specific modules but rather are distributed throughout the cognitive networks. The present of parallel distributed processing has been shown in psychological demonstrations like the [[Stroop effect]], where the brain seems to be analyzing the perception of color and meaning of language at the same time.&lt;ref name="Rumelhart"/&gt; However, this theoretical approach has been continually disproved because the two cognitive functions for color-perception and word-forming are operating separately and simultaneously, not parallel of each other.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

The field of cognition may have benefitted from the use of connectionist network but because of the completed system, setting up the neural network models can be quite a tedious task and the results may be less interpretable than the system they are trying to model. Therefore, the results can be used as evidence for broad theory of cognition without explaining the particular process happening within the cognitive function. Other disadvantages of connectionism lie in the research methods it employs or hypothesis it tests, which has been proven inaccurate or ineffective often, taking connectionist models further from an accurate representation of how the brain functions. These issues cause neural network models to be ineffective on studying higher forms of information-processing, and hinder connectionism from advancing the general understanding of human cognition.&lt;ref name="Garson"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6480">A '''display list''' (or ''display file'') is a series of graphics commands that define an output image. The image is created ([[Rendering (computer graphics)|''rendered'']]) by executing the commands to combine various [[Geometric primitive|primitives]]. This activity is most often performed by specialized display or processing hardware partly or completely independent of the system's CPU for the purpose of freeing the CPU from the overhead of maintaining the display, and may provide output features or speed beyond the CPU's capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=OpenGL programming guide : the official guide to learning OpenGL, version 1.1 |publisher=Addison Wesley |isbn=978-0201461381 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chapter 7 - OpenGL Programming Guide |url=https://www.glprogramming.com/red/chapter07.html |website=www.glprogramming.com |publisher=Addison-Wesely |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a display device without a [[framebuffer|frame buffer]], such as the old [[Vector graphics|vector graphics displays]], the commands were executed every fraction of a second to maintain and animate the output. In modern systems, the commands need only be executed when they have changed or in order to refresh the output (e.g., when restoring a minimized window).

A display list can represent both two- and three-dimensional scenes. Systems that make use of a display list to store the scene are called [[retained mode]] systems as opposed to immediate mode systems.

One of the earliest popular systems with true display list was the [[Atari 8-bit family]]. The display list (actually called so in Atari terminology) is a series of instructions for [[ANTIC]], the video co-processor used in these machines. This program, stored in the computer's memory and executed by ANTIC in real time, can specify blank lines, any of six text modes and eight graphics modes, which sections of the screen can be horizontally or vertically fine scrolled, and trigger Display List Interrupts (called [[Raster interrupt]]s or [[Horizontal blank interrupt|HBI]] on other systems).

The [[Amstrad PCW|Amstrad PCW family]] contains a Display List function called the 'Roller RAM'. This is a 512-byte RAM area consisting of 256 16-bit vectors into RAM, one for each line of the 720 × 256 pixel display. Each vector identifies the location of 90 bytes of monochrome pixels that hold the line's 720 pixel states. The 90 bytes of 8 pixel states are actually spaced at 8-byte intervals, so there are 7 unused bytes between each byte of pixel data. This suits how the text-orientated PCW constructs a typical screen buffer in RAM, where the first character's 8 rows are stored in the first 8 bytes, the second character's rows in the next 8 bytes and so on. The Roller RAM was implemented to speed up display scrolling as it would have been unacceptably slow for its 3.4&amp;nbsp;MHz Z80 to move up the 23 KB display buffer 'by hand' i.e. in software. The Roller RAM starting entry used at the beginning of a screen refresh is controlled by a Z80-writable I/O register. Therefore, the screen can be scrolled simply by changing this I/O register.

Another system using a Display List-like feature in hardware is the [[Amiga]], which, not coincidentally, was also designed by some of the same people who made the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 8-bits]] custom hardware. The Amiga display hardware was extremely sophisticated for its time and, once directed to produce a display mode, it would continue to do so automatically for every following scan line. The computer also included a dedicated co-processor, called "[[Original Amiga chipset#Copper|Copper]]", which ran a simple program or 'Copper List' intended for modifying hardware registers in sync with the display.  The Copper List instructions could direct the Copper to wait for the display to reach a specific position on the screen, and then change the contents of hardware registers.   In effect, it was a processor dedicated to servicing [[Raster interrupt]]s.  The Copper was used by Workbench to mix multiple display modes (multiple resolutions and color palettes on the monitor at the same time), and by numerous programs to create rainbow and gradient effects on the screen. The Amiga Copper was also capable of reconfiguring the sprite engine mid-frame, with only one scanline of delay.  This allowed the Amiga to draw more than its 8 hardware sprites, so long as the additional sprites did not share scanlines (or the one scanline gap) with more than 7 other sprites. i.e., so long as at least one sprite had finished drawing, another sprite could be added below it on the screen. Additionally, the later 32-bit AGA chipset allowed drawing bigger sprites (more pixels per row) whilst retaining the same multiplexing.  Note that the Amiga also had dedicated block-shifter ("blitter") hardware, which could draw larger objects into a framebuffer. This was often used in place of, or in addition to, sprites.

In more primitive systems, the results of a display list can be simulated, though at the cost of CPU-intensive writes to certain display-mode, color-control, or other visual effect registers in the video device, rather than a series of rendering commands executed by the device.  Thus, one must create the displayed image using some other rendering process, either before or while the CPU-driven display generation executes.  In many cases, the image is also modified or re-rendered between [[film frame|frames]].  The image is then displayed in various ways, depending on the exact way in which the CPU-driven display code is implemented.

Examples of the results possible on these older machines requiring CPU-driven video include effects such as Commodore 64/128's [http://www.studiostyle.sk/dmagic/gallery/gfxmodes.htm FLI] mode, or [[Rainbow Processing]] on the ZX Spectrum.
==Deprecation==
Display lists have largely been deprecated in modern graphics architectures, as they represent a set of commands in the fixed function [[Graphics pipeline]].  Modern architectures use shaders and [[vertex buffer object|vertex buffer objects]], to avoid tying graphics performance to the [[CPU]].

The '''Doctor of Social Work''' (DSW) is a [[professional doctorate]] in [[social work]], most often offering advanced training in a professional area of practice including but not limited to; [[nonprofit organization]], [[leadership development]], and [[social justice]]. The DSW usually focuses on clinical practice or nonprofit administration. The DSW is related to, but also distinct from the more traditional [[PhD]], which is a more research-oriented degree for social workers who wish primarily to further their careers in academia or research settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Social Work Doctoral Programs |url=https://socialworklicensure.org/social-worker-education/social-work-doctoral-programs/ |website=SocialWorkLicensure.org |accessdate=November 10, 2018 |language=English |quote=There are two types of social work doctorate: the DSW and the PhD. The Doctor of Social Work or DSW has traditionally been considered a practice doctorate, as opposed to a research degree. It’s the newer degree, but it’s actually far from new. The first DSW programs came into being in the 1940’s – when today’s retirees were mere children.  There is a difference between DSW and PhD programs… sometimes. The title of the degree may have as much to do with its history as its current requirements. Each degree has had times in history when it was favored. If a school offers both degrees, one can expect the PhD to be the research-heavy one.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although different schools vary in the extent to which they emphasize each, both DSW and PhD candidates in the field of social work gain experience in education, advanced practice, teaching, supervision, research, policy analysis, administration and/or program development. As with other doctorates, a holder of a DSW is referred to using the formal title of 'doctor'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url= https://socialworklicensure.org/social-worker-education/social-work-doctoral-programs/
 |title= Social Work Doctoral Programs
 |access-date= October 12, 2018
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who hold the '''Doctor of Social Work''' work in a variety of fields and disciplines that coincide with that of [[social work]] including [[higher education]], [[health care administration]] and [[nonprofit organization]]. 

==History of the DSW degree==
Although the first doctoral degrees that were offered in the field of social work were that of PhD's, in late 1940's the '''Doctor of Social Work''' program emerged, with some of the earliest DSW degrees having been offered at [[University of Pennsylvania]] and [[Smith College]]. Some institutions that originally offered PhD programs in Social Work later converted to the DSW professional doctorate degree due to growing and improving trends in social work and in academia. 

By the 1960's and 1970's, doctoral degrees for social work increased significantly. By the early 1970's, many universities began only offering the DSW professional doctorate, surpassing that of the PhD degree in social work that was originally offered at many competing institutions. 

Over the years, great confusion lied between the PhD and the DSW with many holders of the DSW entering research based positions within higher education. Seeing that the DSW is a professional practice based doctorate, many institutions slowly began to remove the DSW from their curriculum in an effort to promote research education within the discipline. 

With many social workers and allied health professionals pursuing clinical practice based doctoral degrees in other disciplines including education, nursing, psychology, physical therapy and nutrition, the discussion to promote the DSW degree was slowly placed at the forefront. 

Understanding that not all practice based doctorates should be solely focused on advanced clinical practice, the DSW was emerged as an advanced practice [[professional doctorate]]. 

Having being an advanced practice doctoral degree, the Doctor of Social Work is an important development in community based social services encompassing components in education, social justice, social welfare and policy development/analysis. 

Holders of this degree are expected to work in a variety of fields and arenas in social service agencies, health and mental health care institutions, higher education and academia, and community service organizations.

==Time frame==

The typical time frame for completion of a Doctor of Social Work is 3 to 4 years after earning a master's degree. Some institutions however, offer an advanced alternative to the degree for those with prior knowledge and experience in social work and furthermore, for holders with other social work oriented degrees.

==Admission==

Admission to a Doctor of Social Work program in the USA is highly competitive. Typically, institutions require applicants to hold a master's degree. Applicants may also hold a MSW degree from a Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) accredited program or a related degree including but not limited to [[Master of Public Administration]] (MPA), [[Master of Public Health]] (MPA),  [[Master of Arts in Education]] (MAEd), [[Master of Science in Nursing]] (MSN), [[Master of Public Policy]] (MPP) and the [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA).

'''EIA-608''', also known as "line 21 captions" and "CEA-608",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=SCTE 21 2012 - STANDARD FOR CARRIAGE OF VBI DATA IN CABLE DIGITAL TRANSPORT STREAMS|journal=Society of Cable Telecommunications Engineers|year=2012|volume=SCTE 21|pages=13|url=http://www.scte.org/documents/pdf/Standards/SCTE%2021%202012.pdf|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; used to be the standard for closed captioning for [[NTSC]] TV [[Broadcasting|broadcasts]] in the United States, Canada and Mexico. It also specifies an "Extended Data Service", which is a means for including a VCR control service with a now/next EPG for [[NTSC]] transmissions that operates on the even line 21 field, similar to the TeleText based [[Programme Delivery Control|VPS]] that operates on line 16 which is used in [[PAL]] countries.

It was developed by the [[Electronic Industries Alliance]] and required by law to be implemented in most television receivers made in the United States.

EIA-608 captions are transmitted on either the odd or even fields of line 21 with an odd parity bit in the non-visible active video data area in NTSC broadcasts, and are also sometimes present in the [[picture user data]] in [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]] [[transmission (telecom)|transmissions]]. It uses a fixed bandwidth of 480 bit/s per line 21 field for a maximum of 32 characters per line per caption (maximum four captions) for a 30 frame broadcast.  The odd field captions relate to the primary audio track and the even field captions related to the SAP or secondary audio track which is generally a second language translation of the primary audio, such as a French or Spanish translation of an English-speaking TV show.

Raw EIA-608 caption byte pairs are becoming less prevalent as [[digital television]] replaces analog. ATSC broadcasts instead use the [[EIA-708]] caption protocol to encapsulate both the EIA-608 caption pairs as well as a native EIA-708 stream.  EIA-608 has had revisions with the addition of extended character sets to fully support the representation of the Spanish, French, German languages, and cross section of other Western European [[language]]s.  EIA-608 was also extended to support two byte characters for the [[Korean language|Korean]] and Japanese markets.  The full version of [[EIA-708]] has support for more character sets and better caption positioning options; however, because of existing EIA-608 hardware and revisions to the format, there has been little or no real world use of the format besides simple 608 to 708 inline conversions.

==Channels==
EIA-608 defines four channels of caption information, so that a program could, for example, have captions in four different languages. There are two channels, called 1 and 2 by the standard, in each of the two fields of a frame. However, the channels are often presented to users numbered simply as CC1-2 for the odd field and CC3-4 for the even field.  However due to bandwidth limitations on either field, CC1 and  CC3 are the only ones used, meaning that there has been little use for the second channel.  Early Spanish SAP captioned broadcasts first used the second channel CC2 because the original caption decoders only read the first odd field, but later switched to using CC3 for bandwidth reasons.  Due to the same bandwidth reasons XDS was never used by Spanish-speaking stations.

Within each channel, there are two streams of information which might be considered sub-channels: one carries "captions" and the other "text." The latter is not in common use due to the lack of hardware support and bandwidth available.  Text is signaled by the use of text commands and can be used for a formatted URL string with a 16-bit checksum that designates a web site that the captions relate to or a local station communication channel.

==DVD GOP User Data Insertion==
The user data structure that follows a [[H.262]] GOP header is as follows (the same would apply after an ISO/IEC 14496-2 GOP header):
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Length !! Name !! Type !! Default
|-
| 32 bits || user_data_start_code || patterned bslbf || 0x000001B2
|-
| 16 bits || user_identifier || ASCII bslbf || CC
|-
| 8 bits || user_data_type_code || uimsbf || 1
|-
| 8 bits || caption_block_size || inverted uimsbf || 0xf8
|-
| 1 bit || caption_odd_field_first || flag || 1
|-
| 1 bit || caption_filler || alignment || 0
|-
| 5 bits || caption_block_count || uimsbf || 15
|-
| 1 bit || caption_extra_field_added || flag || 0
|-
| X*24 bits || caption_block || binary || free form
|}

bslbf: bit string, left bit first ; uimsbf: unsigned integer, most significant bit first

Caption blocks are inserted after the sequence and GOP headers, so each block is for one second of video which would end up being one or two long lines or three to four short lines of text.  Also that means if the caption_block_count is greater than 30 then the block contains both interleaved caption fields and one could devise the framing rate from the caption_block_count.  However since the data is grouped together the framing rate will almost always be 30/1.001, unlike the ATSC method that inserts one byte pair for each field after the picture header making framing rates of 24/1.001 possible for HD content.  Since when a decoder does a 3:2 pull-down for NTSC output the captions will remain in sync.

This structure was designed for any digital VBI data and was optimized to carry three or more 43-byte [[Teletext]] packets. e.g. a page header and two associated lines.  For Teletext subtitles, the data_unit_id is set to 3.  In this form, captions have to be separated into byte pairs spread over frames in one second of video rather than grouped into one block as with the DVD structure.  The same is true for Teletext subtitles with more than one line of text.

==SDI/MXF [[SMPTE 291M]] Insertion==
The packet-ed structure that is inserted before the [[SMPTE 259M]] active video frame or [[Material Exchange Format|MXF]] essence video packet is coded as follows for a frame of associated video:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Length !! Name !! Type !! Default
|-
| 16 or 128 bits || ancillary_flag or&lt;br&gt;ancillary_header || patterned bslbf or&lt;br&gt;7 uimsbf || 0xFFFF or&lt;br&gt;varies
|-
| 8 bits || data_id || uimsbf || 97
|-
| 8 bits || secondary_data_id || uimsbf || 2
|-
| 8 bits || data_count || uimsbf || varies
|-
| X*24 bits || caption_data_block || binary || free form
|}

bslbf: bit string, left bit first ; uimsbf: unsigned integer, most significant bit first

This structure was designed for any digital audio or metadata that is to be synchronized  with a video frame.  SDI transports every eight bits in a 10 bit aligned packet, unlike MXF which is byte aligned and the ancillary flag bytes are replaced by 128 bit header.

==Extended Data Service==
{{main|Extended Data Services}}
The EIA-608 data stream format includes Extended Data Service (XDS), a variety of information about the transmission. It is all optional,:
* 
* 
* program name
* offensiveness rating (violence, sex, etc.)
* program category (drama, game show, etc.)

==Characters==
There are three sets of characters that the EIA-608 stream can direct the receiver to display: basic characters, special characters, and extended characters. A single two-byte EIA-608 command (represented by a single VBI line) can specify two basic characters, one special character, or one extended character.

Extended characters are a later addition to the standard and their decoding is optional.

EIA-608 provides controls for the color of the foreground and background of the text, underlining, blinking, and italics. The default color scheme is white characters on a black background, all opaque.

The Transparent Space special character implies a transparent background even in the absence of any background control commands. As the foreground of this character is a blank space, it really means a gap in the close caption text.

===Non-Caption Data===
This is used to either pad out the field line when no captions are sent or for the eXtended Data Service.

&lt;/pre&gt;

===Basic North American character set===
A command with bits 13 or 14 on directs the receiver to display two basic characters at the current cursor position for the current mode (closed caption or text). Each character is a code point (identifies the character to display), as follows.
&lt;pre&gt;
                       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
  modified 7-bit ASCII |P|  CHARACTER1 | |P|  CHARACTER2 |

                       15             8   7             0
&lt;/pre&gt;

The code is almost identical to ASCII; the exceptions are shown in red.

In the table above, SB represents a solid block. The apostrophe (code 27), which may originally have been intended to be a neutral apostrophe as in ASCII, is now recommended to be rendered as a right single quotation mark (Unicode U+2019). For a neutral single quote/apostrophe, the plain single quote from the extended character set should be used.&lt;ref&gt;CEA-608-E R-2014 standard&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special North American character set===
The only real use in North America of this set is the use of the [[Eighth note]] character to denote changes from spoken dialogue to singing or musical only scenes.

It is an acceptable broadcast engineering practice when translating EIA-608 to Teletext for PAL compatible countries to substitute this character for a [[number sign]] because of its similarity to a [[Sharp (music)|sharp]].

A command to display a special character has a first byte of 0x11 or 0x19 (depending upon channel). The second byte is a code point in the range 0x30-0x3F as follows.

&lt;pre&gt;
 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

 P = odd parity ; C = second channel toggle

TM is short for unregistered trademark and should be represented in [[superscript]] (™). TS in the table above represents a "transparent space" or [[non-breaking space]]. Finally, the [[Eighth note]] (♪) is used to denote singing or background music in captions.

===Extended Western European character set===
&lt;pre&gt;
 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 |P|0|0|1|C|0|1|S| |P|0|1|CHARACTER|
 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 15             8   7             0
 P = odd parity ; C = second channel toggle ; S = char set toggle
&lt;/pre&gt;

These extended character sets are rarely used due to most European countries using the BBC Ceefax based Teletext system.

The Ceefax system is more prone to character errors due to the greater number of data bits (337 versus 16) encoded per VBI field, these errors occur either on noise prone analog transmissions or connections.

* A command to display an extended Spanish/French or miscellaneous character has a first byte of 0x12 or 0x1A (depending upon channel).
* A command to display an extended Portuguese/German/Danish character has a first byte of 0x13 or 0x1B (depending upon channel).

SM is short for [[service mark]] and should be represented in [[superscript]].  The single quote mark is a [[Non-English usage of quotation marks|curly]] left and double quote marks are [[Non-English usage of quotation marks|curly]] left and right.  The plus signs refer to top left, top right, lower left and lower right corners for [[Box drawing characters|box drawing]].

==Non-Western Norpak Character Sets==
When used all standard and extended character sets are unused in favor of the following predefined sets, care must be taken to not emulate any control commands. This is an extension submitted to the CEC by [[Norpak]] who made a similar extension to the Teletext format for the Chinese market. The main use has been to provide double byte code point captioning to the Japanese, Taiwanese and South Korean markets.  A command to switch character sets has a first byte of 0x17 or 0x1F (depending upon channel). The second byte is a character set reference in the range 0x24-0x2A as follows

&lt;pre&gt;
 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 |P|0|0|1|C|1|1|1| |P|0|1|0|CHARSET|
 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
 15             8   7             0
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Control commands==
Bits 15 and 7 are always odd parity bits. Bit 11 is always the channel bit.

Preamble address code with masking bit 15,11 and 7 as already defined above
can be interpreted from following table
{| class="wikitable"

 P = odd parity ; C = second channel toggle
 U = underline toggle ; N = next row down toggle
 (if style or cursor position not set,
  defaults are regular white text with black background
  at cursor = 0, cursor - multiple of 4)
 text style enumerations:
  {white=0,green,blue,cyan,red,yellow,magenta,italic white}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The row bits specify which of the fifteen screen rows should contain the caption text: row 11 (0000), 1 (0010), 2 (0011), 3, 4, 12, 13, 14, 15, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 (1111).

The attributes bits allow 16 possibilities, which are: white (0000), green, blue, cyan, red, yellow, magenta, italics, indent 0, indent 4, indent 8, indent 12, indent 16, indent 20, indent 24, indent 28 (1111).

For a midrow code these are as follows: Bits 14, 13, 10, 9, 6 and 4 are always 0, bits 12, 8 and 5 are always 1. Bits 3, 2 and 1 form the color attribute 0001X10X(see the listing of attributes). Bit 0 indicates underline.

&lt;pre&gt;

 P = odd parity ; C = second channel toggle
 T = partially transparent ; U = underline toggle
 bg color enumerations:
 {white=0,green,blue,cyan,red,yellow,magenta,black}
&lt;/pre&gt;

For other control codes these are as follows: Bits 14, 13, 9, 6 and 4 are always 0, bits 12, 10 and 5 are always 1. Bit 8 chooses between line 21 and 284. Bits 3, 2, 1 and 0 identify the particular action.

The command bits allow 16 possibilities, which are: resume caption loading (0000), backspace (0001), delete to end of row (0100), roll-up captions 2-rows, roll-up captions 3 rows, roll-up captions 4-rows, flash on (0.25 seconds once per second), resume direct captioning, text restart, resume text display, erase displayed memory, carriage return, erase nondisplayed memory, end of caption (1111).

For tabs these are as follows: Bits 14, 13, 6, 4, 3, 2 are always 0, bits 12, 10, 9, 8, 5 are always 1. Bits 1 and 0 determine the number of tab offsets.

'''EcoRV''' (pronounced "eco R five") is a type II restriction [[endonuclease]] isolated from certain strains of ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. It has the alternative name Eco32I.

In [[molecular biology]], it is a commonly used [[restriction enzyme]]. It creates [[Sticky end/blunt end|blunt ends]]. The enzyme recognizes the palindromic 6-base DNA sequence 5'-GAT|ATC-3' and makes a cut at the vertical line. The complementary sequence is then 3'-CTA|TAG-5'. The ends are blunt and can be ligated into a blunt cloning site easily but with lower efficiency than sticky ends.

== Structure ==
The structure of this enzyme, and several mutants, in complex with the DNA sequence which it cuts has been solved by [[X-ray crystallography]].

The core of the enzyme consists of a five-stranded mixed β-sheet flanked by α-helices. The core is conserved in all other type II restriction endonucleases. It also has an N-terminal dimerization subdomain formed by a short α-helix, a two-stranded antiparallel -sheet, and a long α-helix. This subdomain is found only in EcoRV and PvuII.&lt;ref name="Pingoud_&amp;_Jeltsch_2001"/&gt;

== Mode of action ==

Like [[EcoRI]], EcoRV forms a [[homodimer]] in solution before binding and acting on its [[recognition sequence]].&lt;ref name=Bitinaite_et_al_2001&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bitinaite J, Wah DA, Aggarwal AK, Schildkraut I  |title=FokI dimerization is required for DNA cleavage |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=95 |issue=18 |pages=10570–10575 |year=1998|pmid=9724744  |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.18.10570 |pmc=27935 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the enzyme binds weakly to a non-specific site on the DNA. It randomly walks along the molecule until the specific recognition site is found.&lt;ref name="Pingoud_&amp;_Jeltsch_2001"/&gt; EcoRV has a high specificity for its target DNA sequence.

Binding of the enzyme induces a conformational change in the DNA, bending it by about 50°. DNA bending results in the unstacking of the bases, widening of the minor groove, and compression of the major groove. This brings the phosphodiester linkage to be broken closer to the active site of the enzyme, where it can be cleaved. Cleavage occurs within the recognition sequence, and does ''not'' require ATP hydrolysis.&lt;ref name="Pingoud_&amp;_Jeltsch_2001"/&gt;

EcoRV is the only type II restriction [[endonuclease]] known to cause a major protein-induced conformational change in the DNA.&lt;ref name=Pingoud_&amp;_Jeltsch_2001&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pingoud A, Jeltsch A |title=Structure and function of type II restriction endonucleases  |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=29 |issue=18 |pages=3705–3727 |year=2001 |pmid=11557805 |doi=10.1093/nar/29.18.3705 |pmc=55916 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

EcoRV is often used to cut open a [[plasmid]] vector to insert a [[gene]]-of-interest during [[gene cloning]]. The enzyme is supplied by many manufacturers and requires [[bovine serum albumin]] to work properly.

An '''electrotroph''' is a [[microorganism]] which can receive [[electron]]s necessary for its growth from an [[electrode]] (power supply) terminal.

The chemolithoautotrophic bacterium ''[[Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans]]'', that lives in ocean [[thermal vent]]s, has been shown to exhibit electrotrophic behavior in experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Chemolithoautotrophic Bacteria: Biochemistry and environmental biology, by Tateo Yamanaka, 2008, [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]: section 5.1.3 (p.100) "Various Growth Aspects of ''Acidithiobacillus Ferrooxidans''"&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it switches the electron source for carbon assimilation from diffusible Fe2+ ions to an electrode under the condition that electrical current is the only source of energy and electrons.&lt;ref&gt;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00994/full&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid''' ('''E-EPA''', '''icosapent ethyl''') is a [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] of the [[omega-3 fatty acid]] [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA) that is used in combination with changes in diet to lower [[triglyceride]] levels in adults with severe (≥ 500&amp;nbsp;mg/dL) [[hypertriglyceridemia]].  This was the second class of [[fish oil]]-based drug to be approved for use as a drug and was approved by the FDA in 2012.  These fish oil drugs are similar to fish oil [[dietary supplements]] but the ingredients are better controlled and have been tested in clinical trials.

The company that developed this drug, [[Amarin Corporation]], challenged the FDA's ability to limit its ability to market the drug for [[off-label use]] and won its case on appeal in 2012, changing the way the FDA regulates pharmaceutical marketing.

==Medical use==
E-EPA is used in addition to changes in diet to reduce [[triglyceride]] levels in adults with severe (≥ 500&amp;nbsp;mg/dL) [[hypertriglyceridemia]].&lt;ref name=Label&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/202057s012lbl.pdf Icosapent ethyl Label] Last revised June 2015. Check for updates at FDA label index page [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Set_Current_Drug&amp;ApplNo=202057&amp;DrugName=VASCEPA&amp;ActiveIngred=ICOSAPENT%20ETHYL&amp;SponsorApplicant=AMARIN%20PHARMS&amp;ProductMktStatus=1&amp;goto=Search.Label_ApprovalHistory here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intake of large doses (2.0 to 4.0 g/day) of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids as prescription drugs or dietary supplements are generally required to achieve significant (&gt; 15%) lowering of triglycerides, and at those doses the effects can be significant (from 20% to 35% and even up to 45% in individuals with levels greater that 500&amp;nbsp;mg/dL).  It appears that both eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) lower triglycerides, however, DHA alone appears to raise [[low-density lipoprotein]] (the variant which drives atherosclerosis; sometimes very inaccurately called: "bad cholesterol") and [[LDL-C]] values (always only a calculated estimate; not measured by labs from person's blood sample for technical and cost reasons), whilst EPA alone, does not and instead lowers the parameters aforementioned.&lt;ref name=NLApt2-2015&gt;Jacobson TA, et al, NLA Expert Panel.

===Other fish-oil based drugs===
There are other omega-3 fish oil based drugs on the market that have similar uses and mechanisms of action.&lt;ref name=2014rev/&gt;

===Dietary supplements===
There are many fish oil dietary supplements on the market.&lt;ref name=2015CompareRev/&gt;   There appears to be little difference in effect between dietary supplements and prescription forms of omega-3 fatty acids, but EPA and DHA ethyl esters (prescription forms) work less well when taken on an empty stomach or with a low-fat meal.&lt;ref name=NLApt2-2015/&gt;  The ingredients of dietary supplements are not as carefully controlled as prescription products and have not been fixed and tested in clinical trials, as prescription drugs have,&lt;ref name=emedDrugs&gt;Sweeney MET.

Updated: 14 April 2015, page accessed 1 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and the prescription forms are more concentrated, requiring fewer capsules to be taken and increasing the likelihood of compliance.&lt;ref name=2015CompareRev&gt;Ito MK.

== Side effects ==
Special caution should be taken with people who have with [[Fish Allergy|fish and shellfish allergies]].&lt;ref name=Label/&gt; In addition, as with other omega-3 fatty acids, taking E-EPA puts people who are on [[anticoagulants]] at risk for prolonged [[bleeding time]].&lt;ref name=Label/&gt;&lt;ref name=NLApt2-2015/&gt;
The most commonly reported side effect in clinical trials has been joint pain; some people also reported pain in their mouth or throat.&lt;ref name=Label/&gt;   E-EPA has not been tested in pregnant women is rated [[Pregnancy category#United States|pregnancy category C]]; it is excreted in breast milk and the effects on infants are not known.&lt;ref name=Label/&gt;

==Pharmacology==
After ingestion, E-EPA is metabolized to EPA. EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and enters circulation. Peak plasma concentration occurs about 5 hours after ingestion and the half-life is about 89 hours.   EPA is metabolized mostly in the liver like other dietary fatty acids.&lt;ref name=Label/&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
EPA, the active metabolite of E-EPA, like other omega-3 fatty acid based drugs, appears to reduce production of triglycerides in the liver, and to enhance clearance of triglycerides from circulating [[very low-density lipoprotein]] (VLDL) particles; the way it does that is not clear, but potential mechanisms include increased [[Beta oxidation|breakdown of fatty acids]]; inhibition of [[diglyceride acyltransferase]] which is involved in biosynthesis of triglycerides in the liver; and increased activity of [[lipoprotein lipase]] in blood.&lt;ref name=Label/&gt;&lt;ref name=2014rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weintraub|first1=HS|title=Overview of prescription omega-3 fatty acid products for hypertriglyceridemia|journal=Postgrad Med|date=2014|volume=126|pages=7–18|doi=10.3810/pgm.2014.11.2828|pmid=25387209|url=https://postgradmed.org/doi/10.3810/pgm.2014.11.2828|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical and chemical properties==
E-EPA is an ethyl [[ester]] of [[eicosapentaenoic acid]], which is an [[omega-3 fatty acid]].&lt;ref name=Label/&gt;

==History==
In July 2012, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved E-EPA for severe [[hypertriglyceridemia]] as an adjunct to dietary measures; [[Amarin Corporation]] had developed the drug.&lt;ref&gt;CenterWatch [http://www.centerwatch.com/drug-information/fda-approved-drugs/drug/1215/vascepa-icosapent-ethyl Vascepa (icosapent ethyl)] Page accessed 31 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

E-EPA was the second fish-oil drug to be approved, after [[omega-3 acid ethyl esters]] ([[GlaxoSmithKline]]'s Lovaza which was approved in 2004&lt;ref name=PBM2005&gt;VHA Pharmacy Benefits Management Strategic Healthcare Group and the Medical Advisory Panel.  October 2005 [http://www.pbm.va.gov/clinicalguidance/drugmonographs/Omega3acidethylestersLovazaformerlyOmacor.pdf National PBM Drug Monograph Omega-3-acid ethyl esters (Lovaza, formerly Omacor)]&lt;/ref&gt;) and sales were not as robust as Amarin had hoped. The labels for the two drugs were similar, but doctors prescribed Lovaza for people who had triglycerides lower than 500&amp;nbsp;mg/dL based on some clinical evidence.  Amarin wanted to actively market E-EPA for that population as well which would have greatly expanded its revenue, and applied to the FDA for permission to do so in 2013, which the FDA denied.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Herper for Forbes.  17 October 2013  [https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2013/10/17/why-the-fda-is-right-to-block-amarins-push-to-market-fish-oil-to-millions Why The FDA Is Right To Block Amarin's Push To Market Fish Oil To Millions]&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, in May 2015 Amarin sued the FDA for infringing its [[First Amendment]] rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Katie | last=Thomas | newspaper=New York Times | date=7 May 2015 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/business/drugmaker-sues-fda-over-right-to-discuss-off-label-uses.html | title=Drugmaker Sues F.D.A. Over Right to Discuss Off-Label Uses | accessdate=17 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in August 2015 a judge ruled that the FDA could not "prohibit the truthful promotion of a drug for unapproved uses because doing so would violate the protection of free speech."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Pollack for the New York Times. 7 August 2015 [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/business/court-forbids-fda-from-blocking-truthful-promotion-of-drug.html?_r=0 Court Forbids F.D.A. From Blocking Truthful Promotion of Drug]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ruling left open the question of what the FDA would allow Amarin to say about E-EPA, and in March 2016 the FDA and Amarin agreed that Amarin would submit specific marketing material to the FDA for the FDA to review, and if the parties disagreed on whether the material was truthful, they would seek a judge to mediate.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Thomas for the New York Times. 8 March 2016 [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/business/fda-deal-allows-amarin-to-promote-drug-for-off-label-use.html F.D.A.

'''''Ex situ'' conservation''' literally means, "off-site [[conservation movement|conservation]]". It is the process of protecting an endangered species, variety or [[breed]], of plant or animal outside its natural habitat; for example, by removing part of the population from a threatened habitat and placing it in a new location, which may be a wild area or within the care of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2014-064.pdf|title=IUCN Species Survival Commission Guidelines on the Use of Ex situ Management for Species Conservation|date=2014|website=|publisher=IUCN|access-date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbd.int/doc/legal/cbd-en.pdf|title=Convention on Biological Diversity|date=1992|website=|publisher=United Nations|access-date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which humans control or modify the natural dynamics of the managed population varies widely, and this may include alteration of living environments, reproductive patterns, access to resources, and protection from predation and mortality. ''Ex situ'' management can occur within or outside a species' natural geographic range. Individuals maintained ''ex situ'' exist outside an [[Niche (ecology)|ecological niche]]. This means that they are not under the same selection pressures as wild populations, and they may undergo [[Selective breeding|artificial selection]] if maintained ''ex situ'' for multiple generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.cabi.org/bookshop/book/9780851995229|title=Managing plant genetic diversity|last=Ramanatha Rao|first=V.|last2=Brown|first2=A. H. D.|last3=Jackson|first3=M.|publisher=CABI|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crop diversity|Agricultural biodiversity]] is also conserved in ''ex situ'' collections. This is primarily in the form of [[gene bank]]s where samples are stored in order to conserve the genetic resources of major crop plants and their [[Crop wild relatives|wild relatives]].

== Facilities  ==

===Botanical gardens, zoos, and aquariums ===
[[Botanical garden]]s, and [[zoo]]s  are the most conventional methods of Ex-situ conservation. Also in ex- situ conservation, all of which house whole, protected specimens for breeding and reintroduction into the wild when necessary and possible. These facilities provide not only housing and care for specimens of endangered species, but also have an educational value. They inform the public of the threatened status of endangered species and of those factors which cause the threat, with the hope of creating public interest in stopping and reversing those factors which jeopardize a species' survival in the first place. They are the most publicly visited ex situ conservation sites, with the WZCS (World Zoo Conservation Strategy) estimating that the 1100 organized zoos in the world receive more than 600 million visitors annually. Globally there is an estimated total of 2,107 aquaria and zoos in 125 countries. Additionally many private collectors or other not-for-profit groups hold animals and they engage in conservation or reintroduction efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ex situ plant conservation: supporting species survival in the wild|last=Guerrant|first=Edward|last2=Havens|first2=Kayri|last3=Maunder|first3=Mike|publisher=Island Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly there are approximately 2,000 botanical gardens in 148 counties cultivating or storing an estimated 80,000 [[Taxon|taxa]] of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ex situ plant conservation: supporting species survival in the wild|last=Guerrant|first=Edward|last2=Havens|first2=Karyi|last3=Maunder|first3=MIke|publisher=Island Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques for plants ==

=== Cryopreservation ===
The storage of seeds, pollen, tissue, or embryos in liquid nitrogen. This method can be used for virtually indefinite storage of material without deterioration over a much greater time-period relative to all other methods of ''ex situ'' conservation. Cryopreservation is also used for the conservation of livestock genetics through [[Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources]]. Technical limitations prevent the cryopreservation of many species, but [[cryobiology]] is a field of active research, and many studies concerning plants are underway.

=== Seed banking ===
The storage of seeds in a temperature and moisture controlled environment. This technique is used for taxa with orthodox seeds that tolerate [[desiccation]]. Seed bank facilities vary from sealed boxes to climate controlled walk-in freezers or vaults. Taxa with recalcitrant seeds that do not tolerate desiccation are typically not held in seed banks for extended periods of time.

=== Tissue culture (storage and propagation) ===
Somatic tissue can be stored ''[[in vitro]]'' for short periods of time. This is done in a light and temperature controlled environment that regulates the growth of cells. As a e''x situ'' conservation technique tissue culture is primary used for clonal propagation of vegetative tissue or immature seeds. This allows for the proliferation of clonal plants from a relatively small amount of parent tissue.

=== Field gene banking ===
An extensive open-air planting used maintain [[genetic diversity]] of wild, agricultural, or forestry species. Typically species that are either difficult or impossible to conserve in seed banks are conserved in field gene banks. Field gene banks may also be used grow and select progeny of species stored by other ''ex situ''  techniques.

=== Cultivation collections ===
Plants under [[Horticulture|horticultural]] care in a constructed landscape, typically a botanic garden or arboreta. This technique is similar to a field gene bank in that plants are maintained in the ambient environment, but the collections are typically not as genetically diverse or extensive. These collections are susceptible to hybridization, artificial selection, genetic drift, and disease transmission. Species that cannot be conserved by other ''ex situ'' techniques are often included in cultivated collections.

=== Inter situ ===
Plants are under horticulture care, but the environment is managed to near natural conditions. This occurs with either restored or semi-natural environments. This technique is primarily used for taxa that are rare or in areas where habitat has been severely degraded.

== Techniques for animals ==
[[Image:Liquid nitrogen tank.JPG|thumb|150px|A tank of [[liquid nitrogen]], used to supply a cryogenic freezer (for storing laboratory samples at a temperature of about −150 °C).]]

Endangered animal species and breeds are preserved using similar techniques.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. 2012. [http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources. FAO Animal Production and Health Guidelines.] No. 12. Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; Animal species can be preserved in [[genebank]]s, which consist of [[cryogenic]] facilities used to store living [[Spermatozoon|sperm]], [[Ovum|eggs]], or [[embryo]]s. For example, the Zoological Society of San Diego has established a "[[frozen zoo]]" to store such samples using [[cryopreservation]] techniques from more than 355 species, including mammals, reptiles, and birds.

A potential technique for aiding in reproduction of endangered species is [[interspecific pregnancy]], implanting embryos of an endangered species into the womb of a female of a related species, carrying it to term.&lt;ref name=NiasariNaslaji2009&gt;{{Cite journal

== Genetic management of captive populations ==
Captive populations are subject to problems such as [[inbreeding depression]], loss of [[genetic diversity]] and adaptations to captivity.  It is important to manage captive populations in a way that minimizes these issues so that the individuals to be introduced will resemble the original founders as closely as possible, which will increase the chances of successful [[Species reintroduction|reintroductions]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wild Mammals in Captivity: Principles and Techniques for Zoo Management|last=Kleiman|first=Devra|last2=Thompson|first2=Katerina|last3=Baer|first3=Charlotte|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the initial growth phase, the population size is rapidly expanded until a target population size is reached.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Conservation Genetics|last=Frankham|first=Dick|last2=Ballou|first2=Jon|last3=Briscoe|first3=David|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-521-70271-3|location=United Kingdom|pages=430–471}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The target population size is the number of individuals that are required to maintain appropriate levels of genetic diversity, which is generally considered to by 90% of the current genetic diversity after 100 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The number of individuals required to meet this goal varies based on potential growth rate, effective size, current genetic diversity, and generation time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Once the target population size is reached, the focus shifts to maintaining the population and avoiding genetic issues within the captive population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Minimizing mean kinship ===
Managing populations based on minimizing mean kinship values is often an effective way to increase genetic diversity and to avoid inbreeding within captive populations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Kinship is the probability that two alleles will be [[Identity by descent|identical by descent]] when one allele is taken randomly from each mating individual.  The mean kinship value is the average kinship value between a given individual and every other member of the population.  Mean kinship values can help determine which individuals should be mated.  In choosing individuals for breeding, it is important to choose individuals with the lowest mean kinship values because these individuals are least related to the rest of the population and have the least common alleles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This ensures that rarer [[allele]]s are passed on, which helps to increase genetic diversity.  It is also important to avoid mating two individuals with very different mean kinship values because such pairings propagate both the rare alleles that are present in the individual with the low mean kinship value as well as the common alleles that are present in the individual with the high mean kinship value.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This genetic management technique requires that ancestry is known, so in circumstances where ancestry is unknown, it might be necessary to use molecular genetics such as [[microsatellite]] data to help resolve unknowns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Avoiding loss of genetic diversity ===
Genetic diversity is often lost within captive populations due to the [[founder effect]] and subsequent small population sizes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Minimizing the loss of genetic diversity within the captive population is an important component of ''ex situ'' conservation and is critical for successful reintroductions and the long term success of the species, since more diverse populations have higher [[Adaptation|adaptive]] potential.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The loss of genetic diversity due to the founder effect can be minimized by ensuring that the founder population is large enough and genetically representative of the wild population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This is often difficult because removing large numbers of individuals from the wild populations may further reduce the genetic diversity of a  species that is already of conservation concern.  Maximizing the captive population size and the [[effective population size]] can decrease the loss of genetic diversity by minimizing the random loss of alleles due to [[genetic drift]] .&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Minimizing the number of generations in captivity is another effective method for reducing the loss of genetic diversity in captive populations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Avoiding adaptations to captivity ===
[[Natural selection|Selection]] favors different traits in captive populations than it does in wild populations, so this may result in adaptations that are beneficial in captivity but are deleterious in the wild.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This reduces the success of re-introductions, so it is important to manage captive populations in order to reduce adaptations to captivity.  Adaptations to captivity can be reduced by minimizing the number of generations in captivity and by maximizing the number of migrants from wild populations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Minimizing selection on captive populations by creating an environment that is similar to their natural environment is another method of reducing adaptations to captivity, but it is important to find a balance between an environment that minimizes adaptation to captivity and an environment that permits adequate reproduction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Adaptations to captivity can also be reduced by managing the captive population as a series of population fragments.  In this management strategy, the captive population is split into several sub-populations or fragments which are maintained separately.  Smaller populations have lower adaptive potentials, so the population fragments are less likely to accumulate adaptations associated with captivity.  The fragments are maintained separately until [[inbreeding]] becomes a concern.  Immigrants are then exchanged between the fragments to reduce inbreeding, and then the fragments are managed separately again.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Managing genetic disorders ===
[[Genetic disorder]]s are often an issue within captive populations due to the fact that the populations are usually established from a small number of founders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In large, [[Outcrossing|outbreeding]] populations, the frequencies of most deleterious alleles are relatively low, but when a population undergoes a bottleneck during the founding of a captive population, previously rare alleles may survive and increase in number.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Further inbreeding within the captive population may also increase the likelihood that deleterious alleles will be expressed due to increasing [[Zygosity|homozygosity]] within the population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The high occurrence of genetic disorders within a captive population can threaten both the survival of the captive population and its eventual reintroduction back into the wild.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laikre|first=Linda|date=1999|title=Hereditary Defects and Conservation Genetic Management of Captive Populations|url=|journal=Zoo Biology|doi=10.1002/(sici)1098-2361(1999)18:2&lt;81::aid-zoo1&gt;3.0.co;2-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the genetic disorder is [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]], it may be possible to eliminate the disease completely in a single generation by avoiding breeding of the affected individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  However, if the genetic disorder is [[Recessive allele|recessive]], it may not be possible to completely eliminate the allele due to its presence in unaffected [[Zygosity|heterozygotes]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In this case, the best option is to attempt to minimize the frequency of the allele by selectively choosing mating pairs.  In the process of eliminating genetic disorders, it is important to consider that when certain individuals are prevented from breeding, alleles and therefore genetic diversity are removed from the population; if these alleles aren't present in other individuals, they may be lost completely.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Preventing certain individuals from the breeding  also reduces the effective population size, which is associated with problems such as the loss of genetic diversity and increased inbreeding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Examples ==
[[Showy Indian clover]], ''Trifolium amoenum'', is an example of a species that was thought to be extinct, but was rediscovered in 1993&lt;ref&gt;Connors, P. G. (1994) [http://docubase.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/pl_dochome?query_src=pl_search&amp;collection=Fremontia&amp;id=158 ''Rediscovery of showy Indian clover'']. Fremontia 22: 3–7&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of a single plant at a site in western [[Sonoma County]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Arcata Division, 1655 Heindon Road, Arcata, Ca.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeds were harvested and currently grown in ex situ facilities.

The [[Wollemi pine]] is another example of a plant that is being preserved via ''ex situ'' conservation, as they are being grown in nurseries to be sold to the general public.

== Drawbacks ==
''Ex situ'' conservation, while helpful in humankind's efforts to sustain and protect our environment, is rarely enough to save a species from extinction. It is to be used as a last resort, or as a supplement to [[in situ conservation]] because it cannot recreate the habitat as a whole: the entire [[genetic variation]] of a species, its [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] counterparts, or those elements which, over time, might help a species adapt to its changing surroundings. Instead, ''ex situ'' conservation removes the species from its natural ecological contexts, preserving it under semi-isolated conditions whereby natural evolution and adaptation processes are either temporarily halted or altered by introducing the specimen to an unnatural habitat. In the case of [[cryogenic]] storage methods, the preserved specimen's adaptation processes are (quite literally) frozen altogether. The downside to this is that, when re-released, the species may lack the genetic adaptations and mutations which would allow it to thrive in its ever-changing natural habitat.

Furthermore, ''ex situ'' conservation techniques are often costly, with cryogenic storage being economically infeasible in most cases since species stored in this manner cannot provide a profit but instead slowly drain the financial resources of the government or organization determined to operate them. [[Seedbank]]s are ineffective for certain plant [[genus|genera]] with recalcitrant seeds that do not remain fertile for long periods of time. Diseases and pests foreign to the species, to which the species has no natural defense, may also cripple crops of protected plants in ''ex situ'' plantations and in animals living in ''ex situ'' breeding grounds. These factors, combined with the specific environmental needs of many species, some of which are nearly impossible to recreate by man, make ''ex situ'' conservation impossible for a great number of the world's endangered flora and fauna.

The '''theory of facilitated variation''' demonstrates how seemingly complex biological systems can arise through a limited number of regulatory genetic changes, through the differential re-use of pre-existing developmental components.&lt;ref name="Kirschner2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirschner|first1=Marc W.|last2=Gerhart|first2=John C.|title=The plausibility of life : resolving Darwin's dilemma|date=2005|publisher=Yale Univ.

Kirschner]] (a professor and chair at the Department of Systems Biology, [[Harvard Medical School]]) and John C. Gerhart (a professor at the Graduate School, [[University of California, Berkeley]]).

The theory of facilitated variation addresses the nature and function of phenotypic variation in [[evolution]]. Recent advances in [[cell biology|cellular]] and [[evolutionary developmental biology]]  shed light on a number of mechanisms for generating novelty. Most anatomical and physiological traits that have evolved since the Cambrian are, according to Kirschner and Gerhart, the result of regulatory changes in the usage of various conserved core components that function in development and physiology.&lt;ref name="Gerhart2007" /&gt; Novel traits arise as novel packages of modular core components, which requires modest genetic change in regulatory elements. The modularity and adaptability of developmental systems reduces the number of regulatory changes needed to generate adaptive phenotypic variation, increases the probability that genetic mutation will be viable, and allows organisms to respond flexibly to novel environments. In this manner, the conserved core processes facilitate the generation of adaptive phenotypic variation, which natural selection subsequently propagates.&lt;ref name="Kirschner2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerhart2007" /&gt;

==Description of the theory==
The theory of facilitated variation consists of several elements.&lt;ref name="Kirschner2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerhart2007" /&gt; Organisms are built from a set of highly conserved modules called "core processes" that function in development and physiology, and have remained largely unchanged for millions (in some instances billions) of years. Genetic mutation leads to regulatory changes in the package of core components (i.e. new combinations, amounts, and functional states of those components) exhibited by an organism. Finally, the altered combinations, amounts, and states of the conserved components function to develop and operate a new trait on which natural selection acts. Because of their modular organization, adaptability (e.g. arising through exploratory processes) and compartmentation, developmental systems tend to produce facilitated (i.e. functional and adaptive) phenotypic variation when challenged by genetic mutation or novel environmental conditions.

===Conserved core components===
Animals are built from a tool kit of components (e.g. like lego bricks). Most of the core components are conserved across diverse phyla of the animal kingdom. Examples of core components are:
* DNA replication, 
* DNA transcription to RNA, 
* translation of RNA to protein,
* formation of microfilament and microtubule cytoskeletons, 
* cell–cell signaling pathways,
* cell adhesion processes, 
* anteroposterior axis formation 

Additional core processes, such as appendage and limb formation in arthropods and tetrapods, respectively, are combinations of different conserved core processes linked in new regulatory configurations, and conserved in their entirety. 

===Weak regulatory linkage===
Different core processes become linked, through differential regulation, in different combinations, and operate in different amounts, states, times, and places, to generate new anatomical and physiological traits. These regulatory linkages can be made and changed easily, a phenomenon that Kirschner and Gerhart call “weak regulatory linkage”. Regulatory signals can switch on and off the core components to elicit complex responses. Although the signal seems to control the response, typically the responding core process can produce the output by itself but inhibits itself from doing so. All the signal does is interferes with this self-inhibition. Regulatory change is easily effected because conserved core processes have switch-like behavior and alternative outputs already built into them, which means that regulation does not need to coevolve with the functional output. 

===Exploratory processes===
Some conserved core processes, called "exploratory processes", have the ability to generate many different phenotypical outcomes or states. Examples include:
* the formation of microtubule structures, 
* the development of the nervous system (i.e. connecting of axons and target organs), 
* synapse elimination, 
* muscle patterning, 
* the production of blood vessels, 
* vertebrate immune system, 
* animal learning

Exploratory processes first generate a very large amount of physiological variation, often at random, and then select or stabilize the most useful ones, with the rest disappearing or dying back. Hence, exploratory processes resemble a Darwinian process operating during development. 

For example, as the vascular system develops, blood vessels expand to regions with insufficient oxygen supply. There is no predetermined genetically specified map for the distribution of blood vessels in the body, but the [[vascular system]] responds to signals from hypoxic tissues, whilst unrequired vessels in well-oxygenated tissues die back. Exploratory processes are powerful because they provide organisms with a tremendous scope for [[adaptation (biology)|adaptation]].

===Compartmentation===
Ancient regulatory processes (evolved in pre-Cambrian animals) allow the re-use of core processes in different combinations, amounts, and states in some regions of the body, or certain times in development, while decreasing their chances of generating disruptive or maladaptive pleiotropic effects elsewhere in the organism. Spatial compartmentation of transcriptional regulation and cell–cell signaling are examples. The vertebrate embryo is organized spatially into perhaps 200 compartments, each uniquely defined by its expression of one or a few key genes encoding transcription factors or signaling molecules. An example of compartmentation is found in the developing spine: all vertebrae contain bone-forming cells, but those in the chest form ribs, whereas those in the neck do not, because they arose in different compartments (expressing different [[Hox genes]]). Other forms of regulatory compartmentation include different cell types, developmental stages, and sexes.

==Example: evolution of the wing==
Gerhart and Kirschner&lt;ref name="Gerhart2007" /&gt; give the example of the evolution of a bird or bat wing from a tetrapod forelimb. They explain how, if bones undergo regulatory change in length and thickness as a result of genetic mutation, the muscles, nerves and vasculature will accommodate to those changes without themselves requiring independent regulatory change.  Studies of limb development show that muscle, nerve, and vascular founder cells originate in the embryonic trunk and migrate into the developing limb bud, which initially contains only bone and dermis precursors. Muscle precursors are adaptable; they receive signals from developing dermis and bone and take positions relative to them, wherever they are. Then, as noted previously, axons in large numbers extend into the bud from the nerve cord; some fortuitously contact muscle targets and are stabilized, and the rest shrink back. Finally, vascular progenitors enter. Wherever limb cells are hypoxic, they secrete signals that trigger nearby blood vessels to grow into their vicinity. Because of the adaptability conferred by exploratory processes, the co-evolution of bones, muscles, nerves and blood vessels is not required. Selection does not have to coordinate multiple independently varying parts. This not only means that viable phenotypes can easily be generated with little genetic change, but also that genetic mutations are less likely to be lethal, that large phenotypic changes can be favored by selection, and that phenotypic variation is functional and adaptive (i.e. ‘facilitated’). 

==Computational analyses==
The theory of facilitated variation is supported by computational analyses of the evolution of regulatory networks. These studies confirm that phenotypic variability can be directed towards phenotypes with high fitness even when mutations are randomly distributed, and even when challenged with novel environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="Parter2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parter|first1=Merav|last2=Kashtan|first2=Nadav|last3=Alon|first3=Uri|title=Facilitated Variation: How Evolution Learns from Past Environments To Generalize to New Environments|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|date=7 November 2008|volume=4|issue=11|pages=e1000206|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000206|url=http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000206|language=en|issn=1553-7358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crombach2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crombach|first1=Anton|last2=Hogeweg|first2=Paulien|title=Evolution of Evolvability in Gene Regulatory Networks|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|date=11 July 2008|volume=4|issue=7|pages=e1000112|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000112|url=http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000112|language=en|issn=1553-7358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Draghi2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Draghi|first1=J.|last2=Wagner|first2=G.

==Facilitated variation and evolution==
In the classical [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] view, a large number of successive [[mutation]]s, each selected for its usefulness to the survival of the organism, is required to produce novel structures such as wings, limbs, or the brain. Alternatively, facilitated variation asserts that the physiological adaptability of core processes and properties such as weak linkage and exploratory processes enable proteins, cells, and body structures to interact in numerous ways that can lead to the creation of novelty with a limited number of genes, and a limited number of mutations.

Therefore, the role of mutations is often to change how, where, and when the genes are expressed during the [[developmental biology|development of the embryo]] and adult. The burden of creativity in evolution does not rest on selection alone. Through its ancient repertoire of core processes, the current phenotype of the animal determines the kind, amount, and viability of phenotypic variation the animal can produce in response to regulatory change. In emphasizing the adaptability of organisms, and their ability to produce functional phenotypes even in the face of mutation or environmental change, Kirschner and Gerhart’s theory builds upon earlier ideas by James Baldwin&lt;ref name="Baldwin1896"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldwin|first1=J. Mark|title=A New Factor in Evolution|journal=The American Naturalist|date=1 June 1896|volume=30|issue=354|pages=441–451|doi=10.1086/276408|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/276408|issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Baldwin effect]]), Ivan Schmalhausen,&lt;ref name="Schmalhausen1986"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmalhausen|first1=II|editor1-last=Dobzhansky|editor1-first=T|title=Factors in Evolution: The Theory of Stabilizing Selection|date=1986|publisher=Univ of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conrad Waddington&lt;ref name="Waddington1957"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waddington|first1=C. H.|title=The Strategy of the Genes|date=1957|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[genetic assimilation]] and accommodation), and Mary Jane West-Eberhard&lt;ref name="West-Eberhard2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=West-Eberhard|first1=Mary Jane|title=Developmental plasticity and evolution|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195122350}}&lt;/ref&gt; (‘genes are followers not leaders’). More recently, the theory of facilitated variation has been embraced by advocates of an [[extended evolutionary synthesis]],&lt;ref name="Laland2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laland|first1=Kevin|last2=Uller|first2=Tobias|last3=Feldman|first3=Marc|last4=Sterelny|first4=Kim|last5=Müller|first5=Gerd B.|last6=Moczek|first6=Armin|last7=Jablonka|first7=Eva|last8=Odling-Smee|first8=John|last9=Wray|first9=Gregory A.|last10=Hoekstra|first10=Hopi E.|last11=Futuyma|first11=Douglas J.|last12=Lenski|first12=Richard E.|last13=Mackay|first13=Trudy F.

However, some evolutionary biologists remain skeptical as to whether facilitated variation adds a great deal to evolutionary theory.&lt;ref name=Charlesworth2005&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Charlesworth | first=Brian | year=2005 | title=On the Origins of Novelty and Variation | journal=Science | volume=310 | issue=5754 | pages=1619–1620 | doi=10.1126/science.1119727 | url=http://toriah.org/articles/charlesworth-2005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refutation of Intelligent Design==
[[Creationism|Creationists]] and advocates of [[Intelligent Design]] have argued that [[complex traits]] cannot evolve through successive small modifications to pre-existing functional systems. The theory of facilitated variation challenges this idea of [[irreducible complexity]] by explaining how random mutation can cause substantial and adaptive changes within a species. It explains how the individual organism can change from a passive target of natural selection, to an active player in the 3-billion-year history of evolution. Kirschner and Gerhart's theory thereby provides a scientific rebuttal to modern critics of evolution who champion [[Intelligent Design]].

      <comment>I deleted the line which says Selwyn and Caius specialise in Politics &amp; Social Sciences and therefore offer better teaching. There are no citations for this, and as a student studying HSPS at Cambridge, I have never heard of this special arrangement and this misinformation could confuse potential applicants.</comment>

[[File:Alison Richard Building, Cambridge university.jpg|thumb|Alison Richard Building]]
The '''Faculty of Human, Social, and Political Science''' at the [[University of Cambridge]] was created in 2011 out of a merger of the Faculty of Archaeology and Anthropology and the Faculty of Politics, Psychology, Sociology and International Studies. Many Cambridge HSPS students go on to work in politics and government in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, and China. Other graduate destinations include the United Nations, World Bank, World Economic Forum, and various NGO-groups.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsps.cam.ac.uk/ Faculty of Human, Social, and Political Science]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Faculty houses 3 departments: Department of Archaeology and Anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archanth.cam.ac.uk/ Department of Archaeology and Anthropology]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Department of Politics and International Studies, University of Cambridge|Department of Politics and International Studies]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polis.cam.ac.uk/ Department of Politics and International Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; and Department of Sociology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociology.cam.ac.uk/ Department of Sociology]&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these departments has a worldwide reputation for teaching and research, and the undergraduate curriculum (Tripos) is designed to serve both students who have a clear disciplinary commitment at the time of application as well as those who want a broader multidisciplinary degree. Students with a passion for politics can take advantage of links with such departments as Economics and History, those with interests in Sociology can draw on Anthropology and Geography, while those dedicated to pursuing an archaeology career can specialise from the first year or combine this with Biological and Social Anthropology.

Undergraduate students study several disciplines in their first year and then specialise in one or two disciplines in their second and third years. Clearly specified tracks (Archaeology, Biological Anthropology, Politics, Psychology, Social Anthropology, Sociology, or a combination of disciplines) ensure that students graduate with appropriate intellectual and professional skills. Assyriology and Egyptology are also possible specialisations, within the Archaeology track.

At the postgraduate level, there are established one-year M.Phils in Archaeology (including Assyriology and Egyptology), Biological Anthropology, International Studies, Social Anthropology and Sociology. A new M.Phil in Politics was launched in 2008. Ph.D students conduct research within a wide range of subjects within Archaeology, Assyriology, Egyptology, Biological and Social Anthropology, Politics &amp; International Studies and Sociology.

The Faculty is currently spread across several sites. The SPS Library (now affiliated with the University Library) and the Department of Sociology are on Free School Lane at the [[New Museums Site]]. The Department of Politics &amp; International Studies is currently located at the Alison Richard Building on the [[Sidgwick Site]]. The Department of Archaeology &amp; Anthropology is spread across the Downing Site, New Museums Site, and Henry Wellcome Building.

==Teaching==
'''Tripos (BA)'''

An Archaeology and Anthropology Tripos has been taught at Cambridge for more than a century. A Politics, Psychology and Sociology [[Tripos]] (previously known as Social and Political Sciences, "SPS") has been running at [[Cambridge University]], in some form, since 1970.  From 2013, the PPS and A&amp;A Triposes will be replaced by the Human, Social, and Political Sciences Tripos (HSPS), which will offer students the opportunity to explore a wide range of multi-disciplinary options before specialising in one or two subjects, or to specialise from the first year, according to their interests. 

'''Postgraduate (MPhil/PhD)'''

The Faculty teaches seven masters programmes in  Politics, International Studies, Sociology, Social Anthropology, Social and Developmental Psychology, Archaeology (including Assyriology and Egyptology), Biological Anthropology. The Faculty also has around 200 students studying for doctorates at any one time. Many graduate students go on to work in politics and government in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, and China. Other graduate destinations include the [[United Nations]], [[World Bank]], [[World Economic Forum]], and various NGO-groups.

==Applications==
The number of applicants per place for Politics, Psychology and Sociology has traditionally been one of the highest in Cambridge. On average, there are six applications per offered place, though this ratio is better at some colleges such as Murray Edwards. Colleges with particular teaching strength in Human, Social, and Political Science include [[Selwyn College, Cambridge|Selwyn]], [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius]], [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens']], [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]], [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge|Sidney Sussex]], [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|Corpus Christi]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/statistics/subjects.html#pps http://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/apply/statistics ;]&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers of applications for the new HSPS BA course remain high across all colleges. Typical offers for the course are A*AA at A Level, or 40–42 points out of 45 with 776 or 777 at Higher Level in the International Baccalaureate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hsps.cam.ac.uk/prospective-students/hsps-leaflet&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2008-2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdp.cam.ac.uk/annual_report/sdp_annual_report_2008_2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; the MPhil in Social and Developmental Psychology received 66 applications, with 7 starting the course in October 2008. The MPhil in Modern Society and Global Transformations saw 99 applicants, with 26 starting the course in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociology.cam.ac.uk/annual_report/sociology_annual_report_2008-09.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Full-Scale Tunnel'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/rn_FSTdemo.html Langley News (NASA)]&lt;/ref&gt; (abbreviated '''FST''', also known as the '''30-by 60-Foot Tunnel'''&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt;) was a [[wind tunnel]] at [[NASA]]'s [[Langley Research Center]]. It was a [[National Historic Landmark]].

In 1929, [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] began construction of the world's first full-scale wind tunnel. The design team was led by Smith J. DeFrance. The tunnel was completed in 1931 (dedicated 27 May) at a cost just under $900,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crgis.ndc.nasa.gov/historic/643 NASA]&lt;/ref&gt; It was a double-return tunnel capable of moving air at speeds up to 118 miles/hour (190&amp;nbsp;km/h) through its circuit. It had a 30&amp;nbsp;ft by 60&amp;nbsp;ft (9.1 m x 18.3 m) open throat, which is capable of testing aircraft with spans of 40&amp;nbsp;ft (12.2 m).The wind tunnel is a double-return, atmospheric pressure tunnel with two fans powered by 4,000&amp;nbsp;hp electric motors.

The [[Vought O2U Corsair|Vought O3U-1 biplane observation]] airplane was the first complete airplane tested in the tunnel. After that, it was used to test virtually every high-performance aircraft used by the [[United States]] in [[World War II]]. For much of the war, when it was operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the full-scale tunnel was the only tunnel in the free world large enough to perform these tests.

[[File:Man examining fan of Langley Research Center 16 foot transonic wind tunnel.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Maintenance on the fan]]

After the war, many types of aircraft were tested in the tunnel including the [[Harrier Jump Jet]] fighter, the [[F-16]], the [[Boeing 2707|American supersonic transport]], the [[Space Shuttle]] and [[Moon landing|Lunar Landing Test Vehicle]]. During the 1950s and 1960s, the tunnel was modified and upgraded several times. The principal improvement was adding the ability to test free-flying scale models in the test throat.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/30X60.html NASA Langley's 30- by 60-foot Tunnel]&lt;/ref&gt; The wind tunnel was in use through the 2000s, testing procedures such as free-flight and high angle of attack.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Landmarks.html#FST NASA Langley's National Historic Landmarks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509185106/http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Landmarks.html |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heat transfer''' is a discipline of [[thermal engineering]] that concerns the generation, use, conversion, and exchange of [[thermal energy]] ([[heat]]) between physical systems. Heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms, such as [[thermal conduction]], [[convective heat transfer|thermal convection]], [[thermal radiation]], and transfer of energy by [[phase changes]]. Engineers also consider the transfer of mass of differing chemical species, either cold or hot, to achieve heat transfer. While these mechanisms have distinct characteristics, they often occur simultaneously in the same system.

Heat conduction, also called diffusion, is the direct microscopic exchange of kinetic energy of particles through the boundary between two systems. When an object is at a different [[temperature]] from another body or its surroundings, [[heat]] flows so that the body and the surroundings reach the same temperature, at which point they are in [[thermal equilibrium]]. Such spontaneous heat transfer always occurs from a region of high temperature to another region of lower temperature, as described in the [[second law of thermodynamics]].

Heat convection occurs when bulk flow of a fluid (gas or liquid) carries heat along with the flow of matter in the fluid. The flow of fluid may be forced by external processes, or sometimes (in gravitational fields) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the fluid (for example in a fire plume), thus influencing its own transfer. The latter process is often called "natural convection". All convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion, as well. Another form of convection is forced convection. In this case the fluid is forced to flow by use of a pump, fan or other mechanical means.

Thermal radiation occurs through a [[vacuum]] or any [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] [[Optical medium|medium]] ([[solid]] or [[fluid]] or [[gas]]). It is the transfer of energy by means of [[photons]] in [[electromagnetic waves]] governed by the same laws.&lt;ref name=Geankoplis&gt;{{cite book |last=Geankoplis |first=Christie John |year=2003 |title=Transport Processes and Separation Principles |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-101367-X |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; K is thermal conductivity. T1-T2 is the temperature difference between the two ends.A is the area of cross section.If the area of cross section is not uniform the equation can only be applied to thin layer

==Overview==
{{See also |Heat transfer physics}}
[[File:Erbe.gif|thumb|300px|Earth's long wave thermal [[Earth's energy budget#Outgoing energy|radiation]] intensity, from clouds, atmosphere and surface.]]
[[Heat]] is defined in physics as the transfer of [[thermal energy]] across a well-defined boundary around a [[thermodynamic system]]. The [[thermodynamic free energy]] is the amount of work that a thermodynamic system can perform. [[Enthalpy]] is a [[thermodynamic potential]], designated by the letter "H", that is the sum of the [[internal energy]] of the system (U) plus the product of [[pressure]] (P) and [[volume]] (V). [[Joule]] is a unit to quantify [[energy]], work, or the amount of heat.

Heat transfer is a [[process function]] (or path function), as opposed to [[functions of state]]; therefore, the amount of heat transferred in a [[thermodynamic process]] that changes the [[thermodynamic state|state]] of a [[thermodynamic system|system]] depends on how that process occurs, not only the net difference between the initial and final states of the process.

Thermodynamic and [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]] heat transfer is calculated with the [[heat transfer coefficient]], the [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]] between the [[heat flux]] and the thermodynamic driving force for the flow of heat. Heat flux is a quantitative, vectorial representation of heat-flow through a surface.&lt;ref name=NJIT&gt;{{cite web |publisher=New Jersey Institute of Technology, Chemical Engineering Departement |title=B.S. Chemical Engineering |url=http://catalog.njit.edu/undergraduate/programs/chemicalengineering.php |accessdate=9 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210121252/http://catalog.njit.edu/undergraduate/programs/chemicalengineering.php |archivedate=10 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In engineering contexts, the term ''heat'' is taken as synonymous to thermal energy. This usage has its origin in the [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot#The second law of thermodynamics|historical interpretation]] of heat as a fluid (''Caloric'') that can be transferred by various causes,&lt;ref name=lienhard&gt;

[[Thermal engineering]] concerns the generation, use, conversion, and exchange of heat transfer.

A. |year=2012 |title=Socioeconomic impacts of heat transfer research |journal=International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer |volume=39 |issue=10 |pages=1467–1473 |doi=10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2012.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms, such as [[thermal conduction]], [[convective heat transfer|thermal convection]], [[thermal radiation]], and transfer of energy by [[phase changes]].

==Mechanisms==
The fundamental modes of heat transfer are:

;[[Advection]]
: Advection is the transport mechanism of a [[fluid]] from one location to another, and is dependent on [[Motion (physics)|motion]] and [[momentum]] of that fluid.
;[[Thermal conduction|Conduction]] or [[Heat conduction|diffusion]] 
: The transfer of energy between objects that are in physical contact. [[Thermal conductivity]] is the property of a material to conduct heat and evaluated primarily in terms of [[Heat conduction#Fourier.27s law|Fourier's Law]] for heat conduction.
;[[Convective heat transfer|Convection]]
: The transfer of energy between an object and its environment, due to fluid motion. The average temperature is a reference for evaluating properties related to convective heat transfer.
;[[Thermal radiation|Radiation]]
: The transfer of energy by the emission of [[electromagnetic radiation]].

===Advection===
By transferring matter, energy—including thermal energy—is moved by the physical transfer of a hot or cold object from one place to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mass transfer |url=https://www.thermalfluidscentral.org/encyclopedia/index.php/Mass_Transfer |work=Thermal-FluidsPedia |publisher=Thermal Fluids Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be as simple as placing hot water in a bottle and heating a bed, or the movement of an iceberg in changing ocean currents. A practical example is [[thermal hydraulics]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} This can be described by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;Q=v \rho c_p \Delta T&lt;/math&gt;

where 
*Q is heat flux (W/m²), 
*ρ is density (kg/m³), 
*&lt;math&gt;c_p&lt;/math&gt; is heat capacity at constant pressure (J/kg·K), 
*ΔT is the change in temperature (K), 
*&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is velocity (m/s).

===Conduction===
{{main|Thermal conduction}}
On a microscopic scale, heat conduction occurs as hot, rapidly moving or vibrating atoms and molecules interact with neighboring atoms and molecules, transferring some of their energy (heat) to these neighboring particles. In other words, heat is transferred by conduction when adjacent atoms vibrate against one another, or as electrons move from one atom to another. Conduction is the most significant means of heat transfer within a solid or between solid objects in [[thermal contact]]. Fluids—especially gases—are less conductive. [[Thermal contact conductance]] is the study of heat conduction between solid bodies in contact.&lt;ref name=Abbott&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=J.M. |last2=Smith |first2=H.C. |last3=Van Ness |first3=M.M. |title=Introduction to Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics |year=2005 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=Boston, Montreal |isbn=0-07-310445-0 |edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of heat transfer from one place to another place without the movement of particles is called conduction. Example: Heat transfer through Metal rods.{{clarify|date=December 2016}} ''Steady state conduction'' (see [[Fourier's law]]) is a form of conduction that happens when the temperature difference driving the conduction is constant, so that after an equilibration time, the spatial distribution of temperatures in the conducting object does not change any further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Heat conduction |url=https://www.thermalfluidscentral.org/encyclopedia/index.php/Heat_Conduction |work=Thermal-FluidsPedia |publisher=Thermal Fluids Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; In steady state conduction, the amount of heat entering a section is equal to amount of heat coming out.&lt;ref name="Abbott"/&gt;

''Transient conduction'' (see [[Heat equation]]) occurs when the temperature within an object changes as a function of time. Analysis of transient systems is more complex and often calls for the application of approximation theories or numerical analysis by computer.&lt;ref name="Abbott"/&gt;

===Convection===
{{main|Convection}}
The flow of fluid may be forced by external processes, or sometimes (in gravitational fields) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the fluid (for example in a fire plume), thus influencing its own transfer. The latter process is often called "natural convection". All convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion, as well. Another form of convection is forced convection. In this case the fluid is forced to flow by using a pump, fan or other mechanical means.

[[Convective heat transfer]], or convection, is the transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement of [[fluids]], a process that is essentially the transfer of heat via [[mass transfer]]. Bulk motion of fluid enhances heat transfer in many physical situations, such as (for example) between a solid surface and the fluid.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convection is usually the dominant form of heat transfer in liquids and gases. Although sometimes discussed as a third method of heat transfer, convection is usually used to describe the combined effects of heat conduction within the fluid (diffusion) and heat transference by bulk fluid flow streaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Convective heat transfer |url=https://www.thermalfluidscentral.org/encyclopedia/index.php/Convective_Heat_Transfer |work=Thermal-FluidsPedia |publisher=Thermal Fluids Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of transport by fluid streaming is known as advection, but pure advection is a term that is generally associated only with mass transport in fluids, such as advection of pebbles in a river. In the case of heat transfer in fluids, where transport by advection in a fluid is always also accompanied by transport via heat diffusion (also known as heat conduction) the process of heat convection is understood to refer to the sum of heat transport by advection and diffusion/conduction.

Free, or natural, convection occurs when bulk fluid motions (streams and currents) are caused by buoyancy forces that result from density variations due to variations of temperature in the fluid. ''Forced'' convection is a term used when the streams and currents in the fluid are induced by external means—such as fans, stirrers, and pumps—creating an artificially induced convection current.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Convection-cooling====
{{See also |Nusselt number}}
Convective cooling is sometimes described as [[Convective heat transfer#Newton's law of cooling|Newton's law of cooling]]: 
{{Quotation|''The rate of heat loss of a body is proportional to the temperature difference between the body and its surroundings''.}} However, by definition, the validity of Newton's law of Cooling requires that the rate of heat loss from convection be a linear function of ("proportional to") the temperature difference that drives heat transfer, and in convective cooling this is sometimes not the case. In general, convection is not linearly dependent on temperature gradients, and in some cases is strongly nonlinear. In these cases, Newton's law does not apply.

===Convection vs. conduction===
In a body of fluid that is heated from underneath its container, conduction and convection can be considered to compete for dominance. If heat conduction is too great, fluid moving down by convection is heated by conduction so fast that its downward movement will be stopped due to its [[buoyancy]], while fluid moving up by convection is cooled by conduction so fast that its driving buoyancy will diminish. On the other hand, if heat conduction is very low, a large temperature gradient may be formed and convection might be very strong.

The [[Rayleigh number]] (&lt;math&gt;\rm Ra &lt;/math&gt;) is the product of the Grashof (&lt;math&gt;\rm Gr &lt;/math&gt;) and Prandtl (&lt;math&gt;\rm Pr &lt;/math&gt;) numbers. It is a measure which determines the relative strength of conduction and convection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Incropera |first1=Frank P. |display-authors=etal |date=2012 |title=Fundamentals of heat and mass transfer |page=603 |edition=7th |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-64615-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Ra}=\mathrm{Gr}\cdot\mathrm{Pr}=\frac{g \Delta \rho L^3} {\mu \alpha}=\frac{g \beta \Delta T L^3} {\nu \alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

where
*''g'' is acceleration due to gravity,
*ρ is the density with &lt;math&gt;\Delta \rho&lt;/math&gt; being the density difference between the lower and upper ends,
*μ is the [[dynamic viscosity]],
*α is the [[Thermal diffusivity]],
*β is the volume [[thermal expansivity]] (sometimes denoted ''α'' elsewhere),
*''T'' is the temperature, 
*ν is the [[kinematic viscosity]], and
*''L'' is characteristic length.

The Rayleigh number can be understood as the ratio between the rate of heat transfer by convection to the rate of heat transfer by conduction; or, equivalently, the ratio between the corresponding timescales (i.e. conduction timescale divided by convection timescale), up to a numerical factor. This can be seen as follows, where all calculations are up to numerical factors depending on the geometry of the system.

The buoyancy force driving the convection is roughly &lt;math&gt;g \Delta \rho L^3&lt;/math&gt;, so the corresponding pressure is roughly &lt;math&gt;g \Delta \rho L &lt;/math&gt;. In [[steady state]], this is canceled by the shear stress due to viscosity, and therefore roughly equals &lt;math&gt;\mu V/L=\mu /T_{\rm conv} &lt;/math&gt;, where ''V'' is the typical fluid velocity due to convection and &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm conv}&lt;/math&gt; the order of its timescale.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The conduction timescale, on the other hand, is of the order of &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm cond}=L^2/ \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

Convection occurs when the Rayleigh number is above 1,000–2,000.

===Radiation===
[[File:Hot metalwork.jpg|thumb|left|Red-hot iron object, transferring heat to the surrounding environment through thermal radiation]]
[[Thermal radiation]] occurs through a [[vacuum]] or any [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] [[Optical medium|medium]] ([[solid]] or [[fluid]] or [[gas]]). It is the transfer of energy by means of [[photons]] in [[electromagnetic waves]] governed by the same laws.&lt;ref name=Geankoplis /&gt;

[[Thermal radiation]] is energy emitted by matter as electromagnetic waves, due to the pool of [[thermal energy]] in all matter with a temperature above [[absolute zero]]. Thermal radiation propagates without the presence of matter through the [[vacuum]] of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Radiation |url=https://www.thermalfluidscentral.org/encyclopedia/index.php/Radiation |work=Thermal-FluidsPedia |publisher=Thermal Fluids Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal radiation is a direct result of the random movements of atoms and molecules in matter. Since these atoms and molecules are composed of charged particles ([[proton]]s and [[electron]]s), their movement results in the emission of [[electromagnetic radiation]], which carries energy away from the surface.

The [[Stefan-Boltzmann equation]], which describes the rate of transfer of radiant energy, is as follows for an object in a vacuum :

:&lt;math&gt; Q=\epsilon \sigma T^4. &lt;/math&gt;

For radiative transfer between two objects, the equation is as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; Q=\epsilon \sigma (T_a^4 - T_b^4), &lt;/math&gt;

where 
*''Q'' is the heat flux, 
*ε is the [[emissivity]] (unity for a [[black body]]), 
*σ is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]], and 
*''T'' is the absolute temperature (in [[kelvin]]s or [[degrees Rankine]]).
Radiation is typically only important for very hot objects, or for objects with a large temperature difference.

Radiation from the sun, or solar radiation, can be harvested for heat and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mojiri |first1=A |year=2013 |title=Spectral beam splitting for efficient conversion of solar energy—A review |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=28 |issue=|pages=654–663 |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2013.08.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike conductive and convective forms of heat transfer, thermal radiation can be concentrated in a small spot by using reflecting mirrors, which is exploited in [[concentrating solar power]] generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=Robert A. |last2=Phelan |first2=Patrick E. |last3=Otanicar |first3=Todd P. |last4=Walker |first4=Chad A. |last5=Nguyen |first5=Monica |last6=Trimble |first6=Steven |last7=Prasher |first7=Ravi |title=Applicability of nanofluids in high flux solar collectors |url=http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1019&amp;context=mech_fac |journal=Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy |date=March 2011 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=023104 |doi=10.1063/1.3571565}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the sunlight reflected from mirrors heats the [[PS10 solar power tower]] and during the day it can heat water to {{convert|285|°C|°F}}.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Phase transition==
[[Image:Lightning in Arlington.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Lightning]] is a highly visible form of [[energy]] transfer and is an example of plasma present at Earth's surface. Typically, lightning discharges 30,000 amperes at up to 100 million volts, and emits light, radio waves, X-rays and even gamma rays.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/rhessi_tgf.html Flashes in the Sky: Earth's Gamma-Ray Bursts Triggered by Lightning]&lt;/ref&gt; Plasma temperatures in lightning can approach 28,000 kelvins (27,726.85 °C) (49,940.33 °F) and electron densities may exceed 10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.]]
[[Phase transition]] or phase change, takes place in a [[thermodynamic system]] from one phase or [[state of matter]] to another one by heat transfer. Phase change examples are the melting of ice or the boiling of water.
The [[Mason equation]] explains the growth of a water droplet based on the effects of heat transport on [[evaporation]] and condensation.

Phase transitions involve the [[State of matter#The four fundamental states|four fundamental states of matter]]:
*[[Solid]] – Deposition, freezing and solid to solid transformation.
*[[Gas]] – Boiling / evaporation, [[Plasma recombination|recombination ]]/ [[deionization]], and [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]].
*[[Liquid]] – Condensation and [[Melting|melting / fusion]].
*[[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] – [[Ionization]].

===Boiling===
[[Image:Kochendes wasser02.jpg|thumb|left|Nucleate boiling of water.]]
The [[boiling point]] of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=David.E. Goldberg |title=3,000 Solved Problems in Chemistry |edition=1st |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1988 |isbn=0-07-023684-4 |at=Section 17.43, page 321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Louis Theodore, R. Ryan Dupont and Kumar Ganesan (Editors) |title=Pollution Prevention: The Waste Management Approach to the 21st Century |publisher=CRC Press |year=1999 |isbn=1-56670-495-2 |at=Section 27, page 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the liquid [[Evaporation|evaporates]] resulting in an abrupt change in vapor volume.

Saturation temperature means boiling point. The saturation temperature is the temperature for a corresponding saturation pressure at which a liquid boils into its vapor phase. The liquid can be said to be saturated with thermal energy. Any addition of thermal energy results in a phase transition.

At standard atmospheric pressure and '''low temperatures''', no boiling occurs and the heat transfer rate is controlled by the usual single-phase mechanisms. As the surface temperature is increased, local boiling occurs and vapor bubbles nucleate, grow into the surrounding cooler fluid, and collapse. This is ''sub-cooled nucleate boiling'', and is a very efficient heat transfer mechanism. At high bubble generation rates, the bubbles begin to interfere and the heat flux no longer increases rapidly with surface temperature (this is the [[Nucleate boiling#Departure from nucleate boiling|departure from nucleate boiling]], or DNB).

At similar standard atmospheric pressure and '''high temperatures''', the hydrodynamically-quieter regime of [[Boiling#Film|film boiling]] is reached. Heat fluxes across the stable vapor layers are low, but rise slowly with temperature. Any contact between fluid and the surface that may be seen probably leads to the extremely rapid nucleation of a fresh vapor layer ("spontaneous [[nucleation]]"). At higher temperatures still, a maximum in the heat flux is reached (the [[critical heat flux]], or CHF).

The [[Leidenfrost Effect]] demonstrates how nucleate boiling slows heat transfer due to gas bubbles on the heater's surface. As mentioned, gas-phase thermal conductivity is much lower than liquid-phase thermal conductivity, so the outcome is a kind of "gas thermal barrier".

===Condensation===
[[Condensation]] occurs when a vapor is cooled and changes its phase to a liquid. During condensation, the [[latent heat of vaporization]] must be released. The amount of the heat is the same as that absorbed during vaporization at the same fluid pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Tro |first=Nivaldo |year=2008 |title=Chemistry: A Molecular Approach |publisher=Prentice Hall |pages=479 |isbn=|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |quote=When a substance condenses from a gas to a liquid, the same amount of heat is involved, but the heat is emitted rather than absorbed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several types of condensation:
* Homogeneous condensation, as during a formation of fog.
* Condensation in direct contact with subcooled liquid.
* Condensation on direct contact with a cooling wall of a heat exchanger: This is the most common mode used in industry:
** Filmwise condensation is when a liquid film is formed on the subcooled surface, and usually occurs when the liquid wets the surface.
** Dropwise condensation is when liquid drops are formed on the subcooled surface, and usually occurs when the liquid does not wet the surface.
:Dropwise condensation is difficult to sustain reliably; therefore, industrial equipment is normally designed to operate in filmwise condensation mode.

===Melting===
[[File:Melting icecubes.gif|thumb|Ice melting]]
[[Melting]] is a thermal process that results in the phase transition of a substance from a [[solid]] to a [[liquid]]. The [[internal energy]] of a substance is increased, typically with heat or pressure, resulting in a rise of its temperature to the [[melting point]], at which the ordering of ionic or molecular entities in the solid breaks down to a less ordered state and the solid liquefies. Molten substances generally have reduced viscosity with elevated temperature; an exception to this maxim is the element [[sulfur]], whose viscosity increases to a point due to [[polymerization]] and then decreases with higher temperatures in its molten state.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan (2011) ''Sulfur'', Encyclopedia of Earth, eds. A. Jorgensen and C. J. Cleveland, National Council for Science and the environment, Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modeling approaches==
Heat transfer can be modeled in the following ways.

===Climate models===
[[Climate models]] study the [[Thermal radiation|radiant heat transfer]] by using quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice.

===Heat equation===
The [[heat equation]] is an important [[partial differential equation]] that describes the distribution of heat (or variation in temperature) in a given region over time. In some cases, exact solutions of the equation are available;&lt;ref name="Wendl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wendl |first=M. C. |date=2012 |title=Theoretical Foundations of Conduction and Convection Heat Transfer |url=http://wendl.weebly.com/textbook.html |location=|publisher=Wendl Foundation |page=|isbn=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other cases the equation must be solved numerically using [[Computational fluid dynamics|computational methods]].

===Lumped system analysis===
Lumped system analysis often reduces the complexity of the equations to one first-order linear differential equation, in which case heating and cooling are described by a simple exponential solution, often referred to as [[Newton's law of cooling]].

System analysis by the [[lumped capacitance model]] is a common approximation in transient conduction that may be used whenever heat conduction within an object is much faster than heat conduction across the boundary of the object. This is a method of approximation that reduces one aspect of the transient conduction system—that within the object—to an equivalent steady state system. That is, the method assumes that the temperature within the object is completely uniform, although its value may be changing in time.

In this method, the ratio of the conductive heat resistance within the object to the convective heat transfer resistance across the object's boundary, known as the ''[[Biot number]]'', is calculated. For small Biot numbers, the approximation of ''spatially uniform temperature within the object'' can be used: it can be presumed that heat transferred into the object has time to uniformly distribute itself, due to the lower resistance to doing so, as compared with the resistance to heat entering the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to simplify for small Biot numbers |url=http://www.pirobloc.com/en/blog-en/how-to-simplify-for-small-biot-numbers |accessdate=December 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engineering==
[[File:Nelson tulsa test.jpg|thumb|right|Heat exposure as part of a fire test for firestop products]]
Heat transfer has broad application to the functioning of numerous devices and systems. Heat-transfer principles may be used to preserve, increase, or decrease temperature in a wide variety of circumstances.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Heat transfer methods are used in numerous disciplines, such as [[automotive engineering]], [[thermal management of electronic devices and systems]], [[HVAC|climate control]], [[thermal insulation|insulation]], [[process (engineering)|materials processing]], and [[power station]] engineering.

===Insulation, radiance and resistance===
[[Thermal insulation|Thermal insulators]] are materials specifically designed to reduce the flow of heat by limiting conduction, convection, or both. [[Thermal resistance]] is a heat property and the measurement by which an object or material resists to heat flow (heat per time unit or thermal resistance) to temperature difference.

[[Radiance]] or spectral radiance are measures of the quantity of radiation that passes through or is emitted. [[Radiant barrier]]s are materials that [[Reflection (physics)|reflect]] radiation, and therefore reduce the flow of heat from radiation sources. Good insulators are not necessarily good radiant barriers, and vice versa. Metal, for instance, is an excellent reflector and a poor insulator.

The effectiveness of a radiant barrier is indicated by its '''reflectivity''', which is the fraction of radiation reflected. A material with a high reflectivity (at a given wavelength) has a low emissivity (at that same wavelength), and vice versa. At any specific wavelength, reflectivity=1 - emissivity. An ideal radiant barrier would have a reflectivity of 1, and would therefore reflect 100 percent of incoming radiation. [[Vacuum flasks]], or Dewars, are [[silvered]] to approach this ideal. In the vacuum of space, satellites use [[multi-layer insulation]], which consists of many layers of aluminized (shiny) [[Mylar]] to greatly reduce radiation heat transfer and control satellite temperature.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Devices===
[[Image:heat engine.png|300px|thumb|right|Schematic flow of energy in a heat engine.]]
A [[heat engine]] is a system that performs the conversion of a flow of [[thermal energy]] (heat) to [[mechanical energy]] to perform [[mechanical work]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamentals of Classical Thermodynamics'', 3rd ed. p. 159, (1985) by G. J. Van Wylen and R. E. Sonntag: "A heat engine may be defined as a device that operates in a thermodynamic cycle and does a certain amount of net positive work as a result of heat transfer from a high-temperature body and to a low-temperature body. Often the term heat engine is used in a broader sense to include all devices that produce work, either through heat transfer or combustion, even though the device does not operate in a thermodynamic cycle. The internal-combustion engine and the gas turbine are examples of such devices, and calling these heat engines is an acceptable use of the term."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mechanical efficiency of heat engines'', p. 1 (2007) by James R. Senf: "Heat engines are made to provide mechanical energy from thermal energy."&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[thermocouple]] is a temperature-measuring device and widely used type of temperature sensor for measurement and control, and can also be used to convert heat into electric power.

A [[thermoelectric cooler]] is a solid state electronic device that pumps (transfers) heat from one side of the device to the other when electric current is passed through it. It is based on the [[Peltier effect]].

A [[thermal diode]] or [[thermal rectifier]] is a device that causes heat to flow preferentially in one direction.

====Heat exchangers====
A [[heat exchanger]] is used for more efficient heat transfer or to dissipate heat. Heat exchangers are widely used in [[refrigeration]], [[air conditioning]], [[space heating]], [[power generation]], and chemical processing. One common example of a heat exchanger is a car's radiator, in which the hot [[coolant|coolant fluid]] is cooled by the flow of air over the radiator's surface.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Common types of heat exchanger flows include parallel flow, counter flow, and cross flow. In parallel flow, both fluids move in the same direction while transferring heat; in counter flow, the fluids move in opposite directions; and in cross flow, the fluids move at [[right angle]]s to each other. Common constructions for heat exchanger include shell and tube, [[Heat exchanger#Double pipe heat exchanger|double pipe]], extruded finned pipe, spiral fin pipe, u-tube, and stacked plate.{{Elucidate|date=November 2010}}

A [[heat sink]] is a component that transfers heat generated within a solid material to a fluid medium, such as air or a liquid. Examples of heat sinks are the heat exchangers used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems or the radiator in a car. A [[heat pipe]] is another heat-transfer device that combines thermal conductivity and phase transition to efficiently transfer heat between two solid interfaces.

==Applications==

===Architecture===
[[Efficient energy use]] is the goal to reduce the amount of energy required in heating or cooling. In architecture, condensation and [[air current]]s can cause cosmetic or structural damage. An [[energy audit]] can help to assess the implementation of recommended corrective procedures. For instance, insulation improvements, air sealing of structural leaks or the addition of energy-efficient windows and doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EnergySavers: Tips on Saving Money &amp; Energy at Home |url=http://www.energysavers.gov/pdfs/energy_savers.pdf |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |accessdate=March 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Smart meter]] is a device that records electric energy consumption in intervals. 
* [[Thermal transmittance]] is the rate of transfer of heat through a structure divided by the difference in temperature across the structure. It is expressed in watts per square meter per kelvin, or W/(m²K). Well-insulated parts of a building have a low thermal transmittance, whereas poorly-insulated parts of a building have a high thermal transmittance.
* [[Thermostat]] is a device to monitor and control temperature.

===Climate engineering===
{{See also |Anthropogenic heat}}
[[File:Biochar.jpg|thumb|300px|An example application in climate engineering includes the creation of [[Biochar]] through the [[pyrolysis]] process. Thus, storing greenhouse gases in carbon reduces the radiative forcing capacity in the atmosphere, causing more long-wave ([[infrared]]) radiation out to Space.]]
[[Climate engineering]] consists of [[carbon dioxide removal]] and [[solar radiation management]]. Since the amount of [[carbon dioxide]] determines the [[radiative balance]] of Earth atmosphere, carbon dioxide removal techniques can be applied to reduce the [[radiative forcing]]. Solar radiation management is the attempt to absorb less solar radiation to offset the effects of [[greenhouse gases]].

===Greenhouse effect===
[[File:The green house effect.svg|300px|thumb|A representation of the exchanges of energy between the source (the [[Sun]]), the Earth's surface, the [[Earth's atmosphere]], and the ultimate sink [[outer space]]. The ability of the atmosphere to capture and recycle energy emitted by the Earth surface is the defining characteristic of the greenhouse effect.]]
The [[greenhouse effect]] is a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary surface is absorbed by atmospheric greenhouse gases, and is re-radiated in all directions. Since part of this re-radiation is back towards the surface and the lower atmosphere, it results in an elevation of the average surface temperature above what it would be in the absence of the gases.

===Heat transfer in the human body===
{{See also |Wet-bulb temperature}}
The principles of heat transfer in engineering systems can be applied to the human body in order to determine how the body transfers heat. Heat is produced in the body by the continuous metabolism of nutrients which provides energy for the systems of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, Carl; Bibb, Lewis. (1913). "The Human Body and Its Enemies". World Book Co., p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; The human body must maintain a consistent internal temperature in order to maintain healthy bodily functions. Therefore, excess heat must be dissipated from the body to keep it from overheating. When a person engages in elevated levels of physical activity, the body requires additional fuel which increases the metabolic rate and the rate of heat production. The body must then use additional methods to remove the additional heat produced in order to keep the internal temperature at a healthy level.

[[Convective heat transfer|Heat transfer by convection]] is driven by the movement of fluids over the surface of the body. This convective fluid can be either a liquid or a gas. For heat transfer from the outer surface of the body, the convection mechanism is dependent on the surface area of the body, the velocity of the air, and the temperature gradient between the surface of the skin and the ambient air.&lt;ref name="Cengel, Yunus A 2010"&gt;Cengel, Yunus A. and Ghajar, Afshin J. "Heat and Mass Transfer: Fundamentals and Applications", McGraw-Hill, 4th Edition, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The normal temperature of the body is approximately 37&amp;nbsp;°C. Heat transfer occurs more readily when the temperature of the surroundings is significantly less than the normal body temperature. This concept explains why a person feels “cold” when not enough covering is worn when exposed to a cold environment. Clothing can be considered an insulator which provides thermal resistance to heat flow over the covered portion of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Tao, Xiaoming. "Smart fibres, fabrics, and clothing", Woodhead Publishing, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; This thermal resistance causes the temperature on the surface of the clothing to be less than the temperature on the surface of the skin. This smaller temperature gradient between the surface temperature and the ambient temperature will cause a lower rate of heat transfer than if the skin were not covered.

In order to ensure that one portion of the body is not significantly hotter than another portion, heat must be distributed evenly through the bodily tissues. Blood flowing through blood vessels acts as a convective fluid and helps to prevent any buildup of excess heat inside the tissues of the body. This flow of blood through the vessels can be modeled as pipe flow in an engineering system. The heat carried by the blood is determined by the temperature of the surrounding tissue, the diameter of the blood vessel, the [[Viscosity|thickness of the fluid]], velocity of the flow, and the heat transfer coefficient of the blood. The velocity, blood vessel diameter, and the fluid thickness can all be related with the [[Reynolds Number]], a dimensionless number used in fluid mechanics to characterize the flow of fluids.

[[Latent heat]] loss, also known as evaporative heat loss, accounts for a large fraction of heat loss from the body. When the core temperature of the body increases, the body triggers sweat glands in the skin to bring additional moisture to the surface of the skin. The liquid is then transformed into vapor which removes heat from the surface of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilmore|first1=Jack H.|last2=Costill|first2=David L.|last3=Kenney|first3=Larry|title=Physiology of Sport and Exercise|date=2008|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=9781450477673|page=256|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of evaporation heat loss is directly related to the vapor pressure at the skin surface and the amount of moisture present on the skin.&lt;ref name="Cengel, Yunus A 2010"/&gt; Therefore, the maximum of heat transfer will occur when the skin is completely wet. The body continuously loses water by evaporation but the most significant amount of heat loss occurs during periods of increased physical activity.

===Cooling techniques===

====Evaporative cooling====
[[File:Air cooler.jpg|right|thumbnail|A traditional air cooler in [[Mirzapur]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]]]
[[Evaporative cooling]] happens when water vapor is added to the surrounding air. The energy needed to evaporate the water is taken from the air in the form of sensible heat and converted into latent heat, while the air remains at a constant [[enthalpy]]. Latent heat describes the amount of heat that is needed to evaporate the liquid; this heat comes from the liquid itself and the surrounding gas and surfaces. The greater the difference between the two temperatures, the greater the evaporative cooling effect. When the temperatures are the same, no net evaporation of water in air occurs; thus, there is no cooling effect.

====Laser cooling====
In [[quantum physics]], [[laser cooling]] is used to achieve temperatures of near [[absolute zero]] (−273.15&amp;nbsp;°C, −459.67&amp;nbsp;°F) of atomic and molecular samples to observe unique [[quantum effects]] that can only occur at this heat level.

* [[Doppler cooling]] is the most common method of laser cooling. 
* [[Sympathetic cooling]] is a process in which particles of one type cool particles of another type. Typically, atomic ions that can be directly laser-cooled are used to cool nearby ions or atoms. This technique allows cooling of ions and atoms that cannot be laser cooled directly.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

====Magnetic cooling====
{{main|Magnetic refrigeration|Magnetic evaporative cooling}}
[[Magnetic evaporative cooling]] is a process for lowering the temperature of a group of atoms, after pre-cooled by methods such as laser cooling. Magnetic refrigeration cools below 0.3K, by making use of the [[Magnetic refrigeration#The magnetocaloric effect|magnetocaloric effect]].

====Radiative cooling====
[[Radiative cooling]] is the process by which a body loses heat by radiation. [[Earth's energy budget#Outgoing energy|Outgoing]] energy is an important effect in the [[Earth's energy budget#Outgoing energy|Earth's energy budget]]. In the case of the Earth-atmosphere system, it refers to the process by which long-wave (infrared) radiation is emitted to balance the absorption of short-wave (visible) energy from the Sun. Convective transport of heat and evaporative transport of latent heat both remove heat from the surface and redistribute it in the atmosphere.

===Thermal energy storage===
[[Thermal energy storage]] includes technologies for collecting and [[Energy storage|storing energy]] for later use. It may be employed to balance energy demand between day and nighttime. The thermal reservoir may be maintained at a temperature above or below that of the ambient environment. Applications include space heating, domestic or process hot water systems, or generating electricity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9859">'''Household archaeology''' has a long history of anthropological inquiry. [[archaeology|Archaeological]] investigations of the household serve as a microcosm for the greater social universe. The household serves as a space for socialization processes. Household archaeology focuses on the household as a social unit, and involves research on the household's dwelling and other related architecture, material culture, features, and larger sociopolitical organizations that are associated with a specific culture. Household social relationships have been associated as serving as an "atom" for society.&lt;ref name=Yanagiasako&gt;Yanagiasako, Sylvia (1979), Family and Household: The Analysis of Domestic Groups. ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', 8: pp. 161-205, [[Annual Reviews (publisher)|Annual Reviews]].&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, household studied effectively convey information pertaining to flexible economic and ecological conditions&lt;ref name=Yanagiasako/&gt; Household activity encompasses spheres of activity related to function and how people act. Household archaeology redefines the notion of the household and the domestic by challenging notions of what households are, how they operate and the social implications of such analysis. The material culture provides information about such activities. Households are families, domestic groups, and co-habitations. Households function in a variety of fashions.

==History of Theoretical Background==
Household archaeology involves investigations of [[household]] activities. It encompasses social formation processes, [[family]] or co-residential organization and the [[material culture]] associated with such activities. Scholarly inquiry into household studies began in the 1960s with research emphasis upon a micro-scale analysis of social groups.&lt;ref name=Bender&gt;Bender, Donald (1967), A Refinement of the Concept of Household: Families, Co-Residence and Domestic Functions. ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' 65(5): pp. 493-504, Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Households are commonly referred to as the most basic social unit.&lt;ref name=Yanagiasako/&gt; Households operate within social and economic processes aimed to structure general conditions of social life. "Household" and "family" are social phenomena. According to Bender, these constructions are "logically distinct and, under certain circumstances, vary independently of each other." &lt;ref name=Bender/&gt; The household has three elements: the social (demographic), the material (possessions and dwellings) and the behavioral (activities).&lt;ref name=Wilk&gt;Wilk, Richard and William Rathje (1982), Household Archaeology. ''American Behavioral Scientist'', 25(6): pp.617-639.&lt;/ref&gt; Household membership employs a variety of strategies and behaviors. Household archaeology is concerned with the [[material culture]] remaining from basic activity patterns as a result of human behavior.

==Archaeological implications==
The material record thoroughly represents the intimate spaces of everyday life. It challenges how to formulate questions about everyday experiences. How people construct and interact with the world around them provide material evidence of a specific worldview.&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;Dictionary.com (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/worldview Based on the Random House Dictionary, © Random House, Inc. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The household consists of the social (demographic and relationships of its members), the material aspect (dwelling and structures), and the behavioral aspect (activities it performs).&lt;ref name=Wilk/&gt; A household can be considered as “a corporate body organized by reference to shared practices and [a] common estate.” &lt;ref name=Robin&gt;Robin, Cynthia (2003). New Directions in Classic Maya Household Archaeology. ''Journal of Archaeological Research'' 11(2): 307-356.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archaeology of religion and ritual|Religion, rituals]] and social activities are often organized at the household level and reinforced by habitual actions through time. Human agency also affects conceptions of household ideology.&lt;ref name=dictionary/&gt; Scientific inquiry within household archaeology is a balance between theoretical arguments and empirical data to support or refute the evidence. Household archaeology is a platform for examining inequality. Whether gender, social or material, inequality exists in archaeological analysis.

==General topics==
===Defining the household===
The term "family" today implies a kinship tie, while domestic groups are associated with function and co-residence simply implies shared dwelling space.&lt;ref name=Yanagiasako/&gt; A household can be any of these. Household function is concerned with production, consumption, reproduction and socialization. These functions can be interpreted archaeologically. Domestic chores have historically been associated with a gendered division of labor and tasks associated with maintaining the household chores and child rearing.

===Gender===
Historically, a presumed gendered binary exists associating men with the “public” sphere and women with the “private” sphere. This often is explained by the historical division of labor in [[hunter-gatherer]] societies where men were responsible for food procurement of large game and women were responsible for child-rearing and gathering plant food sources. [[Friedrich Engels]] argued that the sexual division of labor was an "outgrowth of nature" because men went to war, and hunted while women cared for the house and prepared food.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;[[Henrietta Moore|Moore, Henrietta]] (1988). Kinship, Labour and Household: Understanding Women’s Work. ''Feminism and Anthropology'', pp. 43-72. University of Minnesota Press: Minneapolis.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument is unacceptable today. Women are engaged in productive, active work inside and outside the home all over the world.&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt; Anthropological inquiry into the sexual division of labor in the domestic domain began with [[Ester Boserup]]'s work on women and economic development.&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt; A universally assumed Western division between the “domestic/house/private” space versus the “public/exterior male world” exists. This launched a structured division between gendered social worlds.  Women have made a substantial contribution to subsistence activities and household production. The structured system of social relationships also implies an “idealized” gendered identity associated with a public vs. private dichotomy. Political actions and socioeconomic motivations aid male and female actions in domestic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, H. (1981) Family as the Locus of Gender, Class and Political Struggle: The Example of Housework. In ''Signs'' 6(3): 366-394.&lt;/ref&gt; The mother-child relationship is often associated with the nucleus of all family groups. Reproduction involves physical reproduction, child rearing and socialization. Households can be organized to collectively achieve these tasks. [[Gender]] themes resonate as a result of this action. Household studies of space and place often involve function and activity. Site layouts, and conceptions of households provide information about [[gender]] roles in the past.

===Household space===
The dwelling itself serves as a material, functional space. The house serves as a "privileged entity" for studying intimate spaces of inside space.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaston Bachelard|Bachelard, Gaston]] (1994) 'The House, From Cellar to Garret, The Significance of the Hut'. In ''[[The Poetics of Space]]'', translated by Maria Jolas, Pp.3-37. Orion Press: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Storage space can assess a socially constructed identity. This process allows groups to apply spatial and social meaning to control knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Hendon, Julia A. (2000) Having and Holding: Storage, Memory, Knowledge, and Social Relations. In ''American Anthropologist'' 102(1): 42-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, discard behavior reflects how acquisition and use reflects patterns of daily life.&lt;ref&gt;LeeDecker, Charles (1994) Discard Behavior on Domestic Historic Sites: Evaluation of Contexts of Domestic Household Consumption Patterns. In ''Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory'', 1(4): pp. 345-375.&lt;/ref&gt; Particular spaces within the dwelling itself are reserved to accomplish household tasks. For example, the [[kitchen]] is reserved for cooking and the [[bedroom]] is reserved for sleeping. However, not all cultures adhere to such traditions.

==Methodology==
Multiple lines of evidence prove to be most useful in household archaeological studies. [[Human settlement]] patterns, site formation processes, and [[material culture]] help to organize household studies that bridge theoretical and methodological interpretations of archaeological assemblages. [[Botanical]], [[Faunal assemblage]], [[ceramic]], privy, [[historical documents]], [[art history]], and [[refuse]] data provide information for methodological applications of household archaeology. Household Archaeology employs a dynamic interaction between theoretical and practical. Applications of “longue durée,” an [[Ethnohistory]] approach are suggested as a method for household anthropological [[Archaeology]]. Joyce employed such methods in examining the socialization processes for [[Aztec]] children.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, Rosemary (2000). Girling the Girl and Boying the Boy. In ''Human Lifecycles, World Archaeology''. 31(3): 473-483.&lt;/ref&gt; Household archaeology encompasses the space outside the dwelling itself. New scientific analysis allow households to be examined using new techniques such as soil chemistry, bone chemistry, and [[Paleoethnobotany]].&lt;ref name=Robin/&gt; Uniquely preserved examples allow archaeologists to examine households carefully and devise new techniques for analysis.

'''Immunotoxicology''' (sometimes abbreviated as '''ITOX''') is the study of [[immune]] dysfunction resulting from exposure of an organism to a [[xenobiotic]]. The immune dysfunction may take the form of [[immunosuppression]] or alternatively, [[allergy]], [[autoimmunity]] or any number of [[inflammation|inflammatory]]-based diseases or pathologies. Because the [[immune system]] plays a critical role in host resistance to [[disease]] as well as in normal [[homeostasis]] of an organism, identificantion of immunotoxic [[risk]] is significant in the protection of human, animal and [[wildlife]] [[health]].

In the non-adult ([[embryo]], [[fetus]], [[neonate]], [[juvenile (organism)|juvenile]], [[adolescent]]) this study is referred to as '''Developmental Immunotoxicology''' (commonly abbreviated as '''DIT'''). For most toxicants examined to date, the developing immune system exhibits a heightened sensitivity compared with that of an adult.  For this reason, DIT screening has applications to human, animal and wildlife health protection.
Immunotoxicological responses sometimes leads to extreme health conditions, as we know it is an immunodisfunction problem it becomes fatal. Different people give different type of response to a certain drug as it gets interacted with their immune system. Some people show [[hypersensitivity]] to a specific drug.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6767">An '''interface control document''' ('''ICD''') in [[systems engineering]] 
&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolter J. Fabrycky]], [[Benjamin S. Blanchard]] (2005). ''Systems Engineering and Analysis''. Prentice-Hall, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and [[software engineering]], provides a record of all interface information (such as drawings, diagrams, tables, and textual information) generated for a project.&lt;ref&gt;DATA ITEM DESCRIPTION, Interface Control Document (ICD), DI-SESS-81248B (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  The underlying interface documents provide the details and describe the interface or interfaces between [[subsystems]] or to a [[system]] or [[subsystem]].

== Overview ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=February 2018}}
An ICD is the umbrella document over the system interfaces; examples of what these interface specifications should describe include:
* The inputs and outputs of a single system, documented in individual SIRS{{explain|date=February 2018}} and HIRS{{explain|date=February 2018}} documents, would fall under "The Wikipedia Interface Control Document."
* The interface between two systems or subsystems, e.g. "The Doghouse to Outhouse Interface" would also have a parent ICD.
* The complete interface protocol from the lowest physical elements (e.g., the mating plugs, the electrical signal voltage levels) to the highest logical levels (e.g., the level 7 [[application layer]] of the [[OSI model]]) would each be documented in the appropriate interface requirements spec and fall under a single ICD for the "system".

The purpose of the ICD is to control and maintain a record of system interface information for a given project. This includes all possible inputs to and all potential outputs from a system for some potential or actual user of the system.  The internal interfaces of a system or subsystem are documented in their respective interface requirements specifications, while human-machine interfaces might be in a [[system design]] document (such as a [[software design document]]){{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}.

Interface control documents are a key element of [[systems engineering]] as they control the documented interface(s) of a system, as well as specify a set of interface versions '''that work together''', and thereby bound the requirements.

== Characteristics ==
An [[application programming interface]] is a form of interface for a software system, in that it describes how to access the functions and services provided by a system via an interface. If a system producer wants others to be able to use the system, an ICD and interface specs (or their equivalent) is a worthwhile investment.

An ICD should only describe the detailed interface documentation itself, and not the characteristics of the systems which use it to connect.  The function and logic of those systems should be described in their own requirements and design documents as needed (there are DIDs for all of these).  In this way, independent teams can develop the connecting systems which use the interface specified, without regard to how other systems will react to data and signals which are sent over the interface.  For example, the ICD and associated interface documentation must include information about the size, format, and what is measured by the data, but not any ultimate ''meaning'' of the data in its intended use by any user.

An adequately defined interface will allow one team to test its implementation of the interface by simulating the opposing side with a simple communications simulator.  Not knowing the business logic of the system on the far side of an interface makes it more likely that one will develop a system that does not break when the other system changes its business rules and logic.  (Provision for limits or sanity checking should be pointedly avoided in an interface requirements specification.) Thus, good modularity and abstraction leading to easy maintenance and extensibility are achieved.

== Criticism ==
Critics of requirements documentation and systems engineering in general often complain of the over-emphasis on documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowler

It may be an (evolving) table of ''goes-intos'' and ''comes-out-ofs'', a dynamic database representing each subsystem as a DB view, a set of interaction diagrams, etc.

ICDs are often used where subsystems are developed asynchronously in time, since they provide a structured way to communicate information about subsystems interfaces between different subsystem design teams.

'''The International Summer University''' is a short-term program that is held during the summer season by the [[University of Kassel]] every year. In addition to the international master programs,&lt;ref&gt;See the list of [http://cms.uni-kassel.de/unicms/index.php?id=study International Study Programmes] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; University Kassel organizes the ISU as one of its internationalization strategies.

The program of the ISU is designed for university students as well as researchers and professionals who want to learn more about [[Germans|German]] and European perspectives in [[Environmental Sciences]] and German Language &amp; Culture. Environmental science has been one of the strengths of Uni Kassel since its foundation in 1971. During the winter season the University Kassel offers the [[International Winter University (IWU) Kassel]]. The theme “sustainability” does not only cover the academic content of the ISU/IWU, but also the program design which encourages continuous learning within and outside classrooms.

==History and development of the programme==
The International Summer University started as one of the Hessen International Summer Universities that have been designed to attract international students to [[Hessen]].&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.isu-hessen.de Hessen International Summer Universities (ISU) homepage] for reference.&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 2001, ISU offers short-term credit-bearing academic program featuring the strengths of University Kassel in the areas of Environmental Sciences and German Language &amp; Culture studies. Apart from the academic components with specific foci, ISU is unique in its host-family program for students to experience first-hand German lifestyle. The University’s long-standing partnerships with industries in the region and experiences in university-industry [[knowledge transfer]] also bring additional benefit to ISU students by giving them opportunities to witness the application of academic knowledge in industrial settings.

Since its inception, ISU has brought some 50 international students to Kassel every year. Some of these students returned to Kassel for further studies and many of them have become the ambassadors of the University and the city of Kassel in their home countries.

The uniqueness of ISU lies in the concern for the [[sustainability]] of global environment and [[cultural heritage]]. While ISU Kassel embraces [[globalization]] and [[innovation]] in the study program, the best practices of the program have been kept – arrangement of host families – to ensure that the visiting students are fully engaged in the [[local community]] and culture during their short stay in [[Kassel]]. Students are arranged to live with carefully selected host families and to practice their classroom knowledge with tandem partners and tutors. Workshops (e.g. German dancing, cooking, sports), field trips and excursions in Kassel and neighboring areas are also organized to introduce local culture and traditions to the students. Since the program is held during the term time, ISU students also have abundant opportunities to meet local students and participate in student activities on campus.



==Program of study==
The study program of ISU includes German language courses which are designed to meet the criteria of the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] (European Language Portfolio) at the following levels: A1, B1 and C1. Students will study in small groups under the supervision of experienced teachers qualified in "'teaching German as a foreign language"'. Interactive and innovative teaching methods are characteristics of this German language course.

The seminars for the engineering module usually cover the following topics: [[adaptation to global warming|adaptation strategies to climate change]], [[earthquake engineering]], [[environmental engineering]], and integrated environmental science [[environmental science]]. Seminars for the German culture module usually covers topics such as [[history of germany]], German politics of the 20th century, [[intercultural communication]], and [[Grimm's Fairy Tales|German fairy tales]]. Students proficient in German language may choose the German-taught seminar of "Deutsche Geschichte und Politik im 20. Jahrhundert".

Students will be awarded 9 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] upon completion of the German language course and two academic seminars in either the engineering module or culture module. The seminars are taught by experienced faculty members in English and optionally in German. Students of the engineering module are arranged to visit industrial partners. Students from the cultural module are arranged to visit the museums and cultural establishments in Kassel.&lt;ref&gt;See a list of [http://www.kassel.de/englisch/culture/museums/ museums] in Kassel.&lt;/ref&gt;

==About Kassel and Uni Kassel==


[[Kassel]] is a mid-sized city located in northern Hessen in the center of Germany. The city has around 198,500 inhabitants and a total area of 107 km2. Kassel is known as the "Capital of the [[German Fairy Tale Route]]" for it is the place where [[Jacob Grimm]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]] spent more than 30 years of their lives to collect and compile the [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]] (German: ''Grimms Märchen'') collection. Kassel is also the city of "[[documenta]]" where the world’s largest exhibition of contemporary art takes place every five years.

In 1971, Uni Kassel was founded in the city of Kassel as a reform university. The University is one of the first universities to have developed an international and inter-disciplinary perspective in research and learning. Being the youngest public university in the state of Hessen, it has currently a student population of over 25,000, which includes some 3,200 international students from over 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt;See the University of Kassel's [https://www.uni-kassel.de/uni/en/international-service/coming-to-kassel/facts-and-figures/ "Facts and figures"] page.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Journal Citation Reports''''' ('''''JCR''''') is an [[annual publication]] by [[Clarivate Analytics]] (previously the intellectual property of [[Thomson Reuters]]). It has been integrated with the [[Web of Science]] and is accessed from the Web of Science-Core Collections. It provides information about [[academic journal]]s in the [[natural sciences]] and [[social sciences]], including [[impact factor]]s. The ''JCR'' was originally published as a part of ''[[Science Citation Index]]''. Currently, the ''JCR'', as a distinct service, is based on [[citation]]s compiled from the ''[[Science Citation Index Expanded]]'' and the ''[[Social Science Citation Index]]''.&lt;ref name=evolves&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garfield |first=Eugene |year=2007 |title=The evolution of the Science Citation Index |journal=[[International Microbiology]] |doi=10.2436/20.1501.01.10 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=65–69 |url=http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/barcelona2007a.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JCRhome&gt;{{cite web |year=2010 |title=Overview |work=Journal Citation Reports |publisher=Thomson Reuters |url=http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/science_products/a-z/journal_citation_reports |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625025211/http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/science_products/a-z/journal_citation_reports |archivedate=2010-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web |year=2010 |title=About Us |publisher=Thomson Reuters |url=http://thomsonreuters.com/about/ |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VenSep2009&gt;{{cite journal |last=Venkatraman |first=Archana |date=Sep 2009 |title=Journals cherish IF status symbol: but impact factor is not the only citation metric that matters |newspaper=[[Information World Review]] |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic journal information==
The information given for each journal includes:
* the basic bibliographic information of publisher,  title abbreviation, language, ISSN
* the subject categories (there are 171 such categories in the sciences and 54 in the social sciences)

==Citation information==
* Basic citation data:
** the number of articles published during that year and
** the number of times the articles in the journal were cited during the year by later articles in itself and other journals,
* detailed tables showing
** the number of times the articles in the journal were cited during the year by later articles in itself and other journals,
** the number of citations made from articles published in the journal that year to it and other specific individual journals during each of the most recent ten years (the 20 journals most cited are included)
** the number of times articles published in the journal during each of the most recent 10 years were cited by individual specific journals during the year (the twenty journals with the greatest number of citation are given)
* and several measures derived from these data for a given journal: its ''[[impact factor]]'', ''[[immediacy index]]'', etc.

There are separate editions for the sciences and the social sciences; the 2013 science edition includes 8,411 journals, and the 2012 social science edition contains 3,016 titles. The issue for each year is published the following year, after the citations for the year have been published and the information processed.

The publication is available online (''JCR on the Web''), or in CD format (''JCR on CD-ROM''); it was originally published in print, with the detailed tables on [[microfiche]].

==Release schedule==
In recent years, it is often released in the middle of June. For example, the 2017 Journal Citation Reports, based on 2016 data, was released on Jun 14, 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://clarivate.com/blog/the-2017-jcr-release-is-here/|title=The 2017 JCR Release is Here! - Clarivate|date=14 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[planetary science]], the '''Kombayashi–Ingersoll limit''' represents the maximum solar flux a planet can handle without a [[runaway greenhouse effect]] setting in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kombayashi, M. |date=1967 |title=Discrete equilibrium temperatures of a hypothetical planet with the atmosphere and the hydrosphere of one component-two phase system under constant solar radiation |journal=J. Meteor. Soc. Japan |volume=45 |pages=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ingersoll, A. P. |date=1969 |title=The runaway greenhouse: A history of water on Venus |journal=J. Atmos. Sci. |volume=26 |pages=1191–1198 |doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1969)026&lt;1191:TRGAHO&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode=1969JAtS...26.1191I }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pierre"&gt;Raymond T. Pierrehumbert. Principles of Planetary Climate. Cambridge University Press. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

For planets with temperature-dependent sources of [[greenhouse gases]] such as liquid water and [[Optical depth|optically thin]] atmospheres the [[outgoing longwave radiation]] curve (which indicates how fast energy can be radiated away by the planet) flattens at high temperatures, reaching a horizontal [[asymptote]] – the Kombayashi–Ingersoll limit itself. Since the equilibrium temperature is the intersection of this curve and a horizontal line representing solar flux, for fluxes above this point the planet heats up indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticalscience.com/print.php?r=262|title=Does positive feedback necessarily mean runaway warming?|accessdate=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kasting estimated the limit for Earth to be 320 watts per square meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kasting, J. F. |title=Runaway and moist greenhouse atmospheres and the evolution of Earth and Venus |journal=Icarus |volume=74 |pages=472–494 |date=1988 |doi=10.1016/0019-1035(88)90116-9 |pmid=11538226 |issue=3|bibcode=1988Icar...74..472K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The limit is relevant for estimating the inner edge of the [[circumstellar habitable zone]]. However, the limit also depends on the surface gravity of the planet, making heavy worlds somewhat more resistant to the runaway effect.&lt;ref name="Pierre" /&gt;

The '''Livescribe''' paper-based computing platform consists of a [[digital pen]], [[digital paper]], software applications, and developer tools.

Central to the Livescribe platform is the ''smartpen,'' a ballpoint pen with an embedded computer and digital audio recorder. When used with [[Anoto|Anoto digital paper]], it records what it writes for later uploading to a computer, and synchronizes those notes with any audio it has recorded. This allows users to replay portions of a recording by tapping on the notes they were taking at the time the recording was made. It is also possible to select which portion of a recording to replay by clicking on the relevant portion of a page on-screen, once it has been synced to the Livescribe Desktop software.

Jim Marggraff, inventor of the [[LeapFrog]] [[Fly (pentop computer)|FLY]] Pentop computer and creator of the LeapPad Learning System, left Leapfrog in 2005 to form Livescribe.

In November 2015, Livescribe announced its acquisition by Anoto for $15m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Sweden’s Anoto Buys Digital Pen Maker Livescribe For $15M|url = https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/06/swedens-anoto-buys-digital-pen-maker-livescribe-for-15m/|website = TechCrunch|accessdate = 2015-11-06|first = Ingrid|last = Lunden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The smartpen==
[[Image:livescribeecho.png|thumb|The Livescribe Echo Pen]]
A Livescribe smartpen is about the size and weight of a large pen (5/8" x 6 1/8"), and is equipped with a removable ball-point ink cartridge, a microphone to record audio, a speaker for playback, a small [[Organic LED|OLED]] display, an infra-red camera, and internal flash memory that captures handwritten notes, audio and drawings.

The user can choose to record audio in addition to the handwritten text. Recorded audio is kept indexed with the handwritten text—tapping on a written word starts playback of the recorded audio from that part of the recording.

The smartpen allows the installation of as many applications as there is memory, and ships with several applications. If tapped on the correct images, it can function as a calculator, for example, or can translate words (the translator software as shipped includes only 21 words in a small selection of languages - as of September 2010 there are no public plans to make a full version of this translator available &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescribe.com/forums/showpost.php?p=24665&amp;postcount=7 |title=Livescribe Forums - Translator App thread |accessdate=December 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Livescribe has made four versions of its smartpen: Pulse, Echo, Sky Wi-Fi (or Livescribe Wi-Fi), and Livescribe 3. The pens can store about 100 hours of audio per gigabyte. 
* The Pulse smartpen, released in March 2008, is available with either 1, 2 or 4 Gigabytes of flash storage. It requires a special USB cradle and uses a 2.5mm headphone jack.&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-20010876-56.html |title=Livescribe writes digital pen's next chapter |first=Ina |last=Fried |authorlink=Ina Fried |date=July 18, 2010 |work=Beyond Binary - CNET News |publisher=[[CNET Networks]] |accessdate=July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The Echo smartpen, released in July 2010, comes with either 2GB, 4GB or 8 GB of memory. Compared to the Pulse smartpen, it is less round in shape and uses more standardized connection ports. The Echo integrates with the Desktop software via a standard [[Universal Serial Bus#Connector types|micro USB]] cable and can connect to headphones with a more common 3.5-millimeter [[audio jack|jack]].&lt;ref name="cnet" /&gt; 
* In October 2012, Livescribe announced the Sky Wi-Fi smartpen, which uses [[Wi-Fi]] to transfer the notes and audio to [[Evernote]] without using the proprietary Livescribe Desktop software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techland.time.com/2012/10/29/livescribe-sky-smartpen-review/ |title=Review: Livescribe’s Smartpen Gets Wi-Fi, Embraces Evernote |first=Harry |last=McCracken |authorlink=Harry McCracken |date=October 29, 2012 |work=Technologizer |publisher=Time Inc. |accessdate=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the European Union, this product is sold as the "Livescribe Wi-Fi smartpen" due to a trademark dispute with [[BSkyB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/18/bskyb-livescribe-sky-wi-fi-smartpen|title = BSkyB reaches settlement with Livescribe over Sky Wi-Fi Smartpen|last = Halliday|first = Josh|date = 2013-02-08|work = The Guardian|accessdate = 2014-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 2013, the Livescribe 3 was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescribe.com/blog/noteworthy/2013/11/13/livescribe-3-%e2%80%93-inquiring-minds-want-to-know/ |title=Livescribe 3 – Inquiring Minds Want to Know! |date=November 13, 2013 |publisher=Livescribe, Inc. |accessdate=December 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BT 4.0) to store the page content and audio on a smart phone. The physical design made key changes. The OLED screen and the microphone were omitted and the smart phone's display and microphone were used instead. The pen's battery life improved and also still holds the written page content.

==Availability for operating systems==
The product was initially available only for use with Microsoft Windows-based computers, but version 1.0 of Livescribe Desktop for the Mac was made available via download in March 2009.&lt;ref name="Mac Ver 1.0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescribe.com/press/releases/release_090303.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305190757/http://www.livescribe.com/press/releases/release_090303.html |archivedate=March 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires OS X 10.5.5 or higher, and was one of nine products designated as "Best of Show" at Macworld Expo 2009.&lt;ref name="Best of Show Macworld 2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/138002/2009/01/bos2009.html |title=Expo Best of Show 2009 |website=Macworld.com |date=2009-01-07 |accessdate=2016-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116152135/http://www.macworld.com/article/138002/2009/01/bos2009.html |archivedate=2012-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no official Linux version at this time, however, there have been efforts to make the product work with Linux, such as LibreScribe and Smartpen-Browser. Livescribe has provided a user forum at the request of Linux users.&lt;ref name="Linux"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescribe.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=7 |title=Support Home Page |website=Livescribe.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's release of [[Mac OS X Snow Leopard|Snow Leopard]] caused functionality and compatibility issues with Livescribe's driver installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescribe.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3762 |title=Snow Leopard Issue

Handwriting recognition functionality is provided by a third-party application, MyScript by [[Vision Objects]] Inc., which sells separately for $29.95. As of August 2009, this is available on both Microsoft Windows and Mac (Intel-processor) systems.

The Livescribe 3 currently has support on iOS and Android. It does not have support on Windows or Windows Phone.

==Paper, applications, and sharing==
[[File:LiveScribe Dot Paper - Mar 2013 01.jpg|180px|thumbnail|right|LiveScribe Dot Paper]]
Livescribe's special paper that allows the recording of notes uses a patented dot-positioning system licensed from [[Anoto]].

===The pattern===
As with all Anoto pattern-based pens, the smartpen can only determine its position on the page when used with paper pre-printed with the dot pattern. Livescribe sells notebooks in several styles, and users can also print their own dot paper with a laser printer capable of at least 600 dpi.  (A color or monochrome laser printer works.)&lt;ref name=faq/&gt;

The Anoto pattern consists of numerous small black dots in patterns that are essentially invisible to the human eye, but can be detected by the pen's infrared camera. The pattern indicates the exact position of the digital pen on the page, and each page has a unique identity so that they can be distinguished from each other.&lt;ref name="Anoto Digital Paper Presskit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anoto.com/?id%3D906 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721235654/http://www.anoto.com/?id=906 |archivedate=July 21, 2010 }}R&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sharing===
Notes and audio can be sent to other users as a "pencast" through the Livescribe Desktop software. The Livescribe Connect service, launched in May 2011, allows pencasts to be sent through e-mail, [[Evernote]], Facebook, Google Docs, and other methods. These can also be saved as an interactive Pencast PDF that can be viewed with versions 10 and higher of Adobe Reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/05/livescribe-connect/ |title=Livescribe Connect Shares Smartpen Notes to Facebook, E-Mail |journal=Wired |author=Bonnington, Christina |date=May 23, 2011 |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While compatibility with OneNote 2010 was initially available, LiveScribe has not provided connectivity support for OneNote 2013.

==Developer tools==
Livescribe developed a Penlet SDK to allow application development for the smartpen. The SDK was based on Java, and applications ran directly on the pen itself. Applications could display text and menus, as well as produce audio feedback. A Desktop SDK for Microsoft and Macintosh operating systems was also promised, to allow developers to access files stored on the pen.

On June 2, 2009, Livescribe announced the pre-release version of the SDK 1.0 for Windows at the 2009 JavaOne Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescribe.com/press/releases/release_090602.html |title=Livescribe Pre–Releases Platform SDK 1.0 for Its Smartpen Computing Platform |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in December 2009, with the announcement of the global developer challenge to "...encourage the creation of compelling applications for the Pulse smartpen in 2010 and beyond."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Press release |url=http://www.livescribe.com/press/releases/release_091207.html |publisher=LiveScribe |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
On April 27, 2010, Livescribe announced the winners of the Developer Challenge:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescribe.com/fr/press/releases/release_100427.html |title=Press Center |website=Livescribe.com |date=2010-04-27 |accessdate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Livescribe announced the closure of its third-party developer program. Livescribe’s official reason for shutting the development program  was to concentrate on "cloud access, storage and services."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescribe.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/LDApp.woa/wa/DeveloperOverviewPage |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816020817/http://www.livescribe.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/LDApp.woa/wa/DeveloperOverviewPage |archivedate=August 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The closure of the developer program upset the developer community who had invested in the program, many of whom maintain an active campaign to convince Livescribe to bring back the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://getsatisfaction.com/livescribe/topics/tommy-1l7gjj |title=Bring back the Developer Program!!!|website=Getsatisfaction.com |accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hackaday.com/2011/07/01/livescribe-shuts-down-developer-program/ |title=Livescribe shuts down developer program |accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://support.livescribe.com/entries/21042243-user-petition-to-bring-back-the-sdk-c-mon |title=User Petition To Bring Back The SDK...

''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'' rated the original Livescribe Pulse pen 93/100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/product/31717/review/pulse_smartpen.html |title=Livescribe Pulse Smartpen |last=Moynihan |first=Tim |date=June 20, 2008 |accessdate=August 19, 2012 |journal=PC World}}&lt;/ref&gt; A September 2011 review in the [[Associated Press]] compared the Livescribe Echo pen to an iPad for the purpose of note-taking and concluded that the Echo is "the best tool".&lt;ref&gt;Svensson, Peter (September 14, 2011).

Some users have noted that ambient noise can be a problem. The built-in microphone on the pen can pick up small amounts of noise from writing on paper, and adjacent ambient noise is often louder than a far away speaker. However, the included headphones have embedded microphones that reduce this ambient noise. (Headphones for the Echo must be purchased separately).

The smartpen's portable size and audio recording capabilities have led some people to question the ethics and legality of using the device. For example, in 2009, Delta Air Lines accused the manager of [[Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta's airport]] of using a Livescribe pen to illegally record a meeting of city and airline officials without their consent. The City of Atlanta concluded an investigation of this matter the following year and failed to find sufficient evidence that the airport manager intentionally sought to record the airline's private conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ajc.com/business/spy-pen-jolts-talks-319303.html |newspaper=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |title=Spy pen jolts talks between airport, Delta |last1=Stirgus |first1=Eric |last2=Yamanouchi |first2=Kelly |date=February 22, 2010 |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livescribe urges its customers to "behave ethically and demonstrate common courtesy when it comes to personal privacy" as they would with common devices such as cameras and cellular telephones.&lt;ref name=faq/&gt;

Some users have expressed frustration with the perceived lack of responsiveness to requests for functionality improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://getsatisfaction.com/livescribe/topics/listen_to_the_responses_complaints_of_your_customers |title=Listen to the Responses/Complaints of your Customers |website=Getsatisfaction.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the most requested improvements are the ability to print forms onto dot pattern paper and a day planner for use with the pen system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://getsatisfaction.com/livescribe/ideas/popular |title=Popular ideas |website=Getsatisfaction.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These requests began to surface soon after release of the pen 
system, however responses from the company are infrequent and tend to be perfunctory.&lt;ref&gt;Note low ratio of participation by company personnel in previously cited forum threads.&lt;/ref&gt;

==OLED problems==
There appear to be design flaws with the OLED display or possibly with the firmware on the Pulse, Echo and Sky (WiFi) models. The OLED fades after one to three years, making the pen significantly more difficult to use because it is no longer possible to see if the pen is on or not and customers need to rely on the audio feedback alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://getsatisfaction.com/livescribe/topics/display_went_dark |title=Display went dark |website=Getsatisfaction.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fading issue is a known disadvantage of OLEDs and results in a limited lifespan. Users have complained to Livescribe, and the company's official response is to point users to tips on pen maintenance and then suggest that users buy a new pen at a deep discount as a replacement. Some users who received a replacement saw it plagued by the same problem. However, the company has taken advantage of ongoing improvements in OLED technology and, as of January 1, 2015, now offers a 3-year warranty on new smartpens (including the discounted replacements).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livescribe.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/735/kw/oled%20warranty |title=20109 - ECHO/WIFI - Smartpen OLED Screen Warranty Extension to 3-Years |website=Livescribe.custhelp.com |date=2015-01-01 |accessdate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The OLED issue has alienated some Livescribe users, especially with the high price tags of the accessories and of the smartpen itself.
Once the OLED display fails:
Many cellphone cameras can see the IR light emitted when the pen is on so using the camera to look at the front of the pen and depressing the ink cartridge is one way of determining the operating status. Additionally, using the Volume Up/Down icons will cause a beep when the pen is on. Unfortunately, there is no way to determine if the pen is actually recording audio without the OLED indications thus rendering useless one of its primary functions. Livescribe offers free, fully warrantied replacements to customers who experience an issue with their OLED displays when their pen is in warranty. For US customers whose smartpens are out-of-warranty, the company offers replacement options that allow customers to purchase a fully warrantied replacement pen for a discounted price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://livescribe.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/731/kw/oled%20warranty/related/1] {{dead link|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25996">'''Nearest neighbor search''' ('''NNS'''), as a form of proximity search,  is the [[optimization problem]] of finding the point in a given set that is closest (or most similar) to a given point. Closeness is typically expressed in terms of a dissimilarity function: the less similar the objects, the larger the function values. Formally, the nearest-neighbor (NN) search problem is defined as follows: given a set ''S'' of points in a space ''M'' and a query point ''q''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M'', find the closest point in ''S'' to ''q''. [[Donald Knuth]] in vol. 3 of ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'' (1973) called it the '''post-office problem''', referring to an application of assigning to a residence the nearest post office. A direct generalization of this problem is a ''k''-NN search, where we need to find the ''k'' closest points.

Most commonly ''M'' is a  [[metric space]] and dissimilarity is expressed as a [[distance metric]], which is symmetric and satisfies the [[triangle inequality]]. Even more common, ''M'' is taken to be the ''d''-dimensional [[vector space]] where dissimilarity is measured using the [[Euclidean distance]], [[Taxicab geometry|Manhattan distance]] or other [[Statistical distance|distance metric]]. However, the dissimilarity function can be arbitrary. One example are asymmetric [[Bregman divergence]]s, for which the triangle inequality does not hold.&lt;ref name=Cayton2008&gt;{{Cite journal

==Methods==

Various solutions to the NNS problem have been proposed.  The quality and usefulness of the algorithms are determined by the time complexity of queries as well as the space complexity of any search data structures that must be maintained. The informal observation usually referred to as the [[curse of dimensionality]] states that there is no general-purpose exact solution for NNS in high-dimensional Euclidean space using polynomial preprocessing and polylogarithmic search time.

=== Exact methods ===

====Linear search====
The simplest solution to the NNS problem is to compute the distance from the query point to every other point in the database, keeping track of the "best so far".  This algorithm, sometimes referred to as the naive approach, has a [[running time]] of ''O''(''dN'') where ''N'' is the [[cardinality]] of ''S'' and ''d'' is the dimensionality of ''M''.  There are no search data structures to maintain, so linear search has no space complexity beyond the storage of the database. Naive search can, on average, outperform space partitioning approaches on higher dimensional spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A quantitative analysis and performance study for similarity search methods in high dimensional spaces|last1=Weber|first1=Roger|last2=Schek|first2=Hans-J.|last3=Blott|first3=Stephen | url=http://www.vldb.org/conf/1998/p194.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Space partitioning====
Since the 1970s, [[branch and bound]] methodology has been applied to the problem. In the case of Euclidean space this approach is known as [[spatial index]] or spatial access methods. Several [[Space partitioning|space-partitioning]] methods have been developed for solving the NNS problem.  Perhaps the simplest is the [[k-d tree]], which iteratively bisects the search space into two regions containing half of the points of the parent region.  Queries are performed via traversal of the tree from the root to a leaf by evaluating the query point at each split. Depending on the distance specified in the query, neighboring branches that might contain hits may also need to be evaluated. For constant dimension query time, average complexity is ''O''(log&amp;nbsp;''N'') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An introductory tutorial on KD trees|author=Andrew Moore | url=http://www.autonlab.com/autonweb/14665/version/2/part/5/data/moore-tutorial.pdf?branch=main&amp;language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of randomly distributed points, worst case complexity is ''O''(''kN''^(1-1/''k''))&lt;ref name=Lee1977&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternatively the [[R-tree]] data structure was designed to support nearest neighbor search in dynamic context, as it has efficient algorithms for insertions and deletions such as the [[R* tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | doi = 10.1145/223784.223794| chapter = Nearest neighbor queries| title = Proceedings of the 1995 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data  – SIGMOD '95| pages = 71| year = 1995| last1 = Roussopoulos | first1 = N. | last2 = Kelley | first2 = S. | last3 = Vincent | first3 = F. D. R. | isbn = 0897917316}}&lt;/ref&gt; R-trees can yield nearest neighbors not only for Euclidean distance, but can also be used with other distances.

In case of general metric space branch and bound approach is known under the name of [[metric trees]]. Particular examples include [[vp-tree]] and [[BK-tree]].

Using a set of points taken from a 3-dimensional space and put into a [[Binary space partitioning|BSP tree]], and given a query point taken from the same space, a possible solution to the problem of finding the nearest point-cloud point to the query point is given in the following description of an algorithm.  (Strictly speaking, no such point may exist, because it may not be unique.  But in practice, usually we only care about finding any one of the subset of all point-cloud points that exist at the shortest distance to a given query point.)  The idea is, for each branching of the tree, guess that the closest point in the cloud resides in the half-space containing the query point.  This may not be the case, but it is a good heuristic.  After having recursively gone through all the trouble of solving the problem for the guessed half-space, now compare the distance returned by this result with the shortest distance from the query point to the partitioning plane.  This latter distance is that between the query point and the closest possible point that could exist in the half-space not searched.  If this distance is greater than that returned in the earlier result, then clearly there is no need to search the other half-space.  If there is such a need, then you must go through the trouble of solving the problem for the other half space, and then compare its result to the former result, and then return the proper result.  The performance of this algorithm is nearer to logarithmic time than linear time when the query point is near the cloud, because as the distance between the query point and the closest point-cloud point nears zero, the algorithm needs only perform a look-up using the query point as a key to get the correct result.

=== Approximation methods ===
An approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm is allowed to return points, whose distance from the query is at most &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; times the distance from the query to its nearest points. The appeal of this approach is that, in many cases, an approximate nearest neighbor is almost as good as the exact one. In particular, if the distance measure accurately captures the notion of user quality, then small differences in the distance should not matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Andoni|first=A.|last2=Indyk|first2=P.|date=2006-10-01|title=Near-Optimal Hashing Algorithms for Approximate Nearest Neighbor in High Dimensions|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4031381/|journal=2006 47th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS'06)|pages=459–468|doi=10.1109/FOCS.2006.49|isbn=978-0-7695-2720-8|citeseerx=10.1.1.142.3471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greedy search in proximity neighborhood graphs====
Proximity graph methods (such as HNSW&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Malkov|first=Yury|last2=Yashunin|first2=Dmitry|date=2016|title=Efficient and robust approximate nearest neighbor search using Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs|eprint=1603.09320|class=cs.DS}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are considered the current state-of-the-art for the approximate nearest neighbors search.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://erikbern.com/2018/06/17/new-approximate-nearest-neighbor-benchmarks.html|title=New approximate nearest neighbor benchmarks|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.benfrederickson.com/approximate-nearest-neighbours-for-recommender-systems/|title=Approximate Nearest Neighbours for Recommender Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The methods are based on greedy traversing in proximity neighborhood graphs &lt;math&gt;G(V,E)&lt;/math&gt;in which every point &lt;math&gt;x_i \in S &lt;/math&gt; is uniquely associated with vertex &lt;math&gt;v_i \in V &lt;/math&gt;. The search for the nearest neighbors to a query ''q'' in the set ''S'' takes the form of searching for the vertex in the graph &lt;math&gt;G(V,E)&lt;/math&gt;.
The basic algorithm - greedy search, works as follows: search starts from an enter-point vertex &lt;math&gt;v_i \in V &lt;/math&gt; by computing the distances from the query q to each vertex of its the neighborhood &lt;math&gt;\{v_j:(v_i,v_j) \in E\}&lt;/math&gt;, and then finds a vertex with the minimal distance value. If the distance value between the query and the selected vertex is smaller than the one between the query and the current element, then the algorithm moves to the selected vertex, and it becomes new enter-point. The algorithm stops when it reaches a local minimum: a vertex whose neighborhood does not contain a vertex that is closer to the query than the vertex itself.

The idea of proximity neighborhood graphs was exploited in multiple publications, including the seminal paper by Arya and Mount,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arya|first1=Sunil|last2=Mount|first2=David|date=1993|title=Approximate Nearest Neighbor Queries in Fixed Dimensions|journal=Proceedings of the Fourth Annual {ACM/SIGACT-SIAM} Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, 25–27 January 1993, Austin, Texas.|pages=271–280}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the VoroNet system for the plane,&lt;ref name="voroNet"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Olivier|first1=Beaumont|last2=Kermarrec|first2=Anne-Marie|last3=Marchal|first3=Loris|last4=Rivière|first4=Etienne|year=2006|title=VoroNet: A scalable object network based on Voronoi tessellations|journal=INRIA|volume=RR-5833|issue=1|pages=23–29|doi=10.1007/BF00263763|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the RayNet system for the &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}^n&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="rayNet"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Olivier|first1=Beaumont|last2=Kermarrec|first2=Anne-Marie|last3=Rivière|first3=Etienne|year=2007|title=Peer to Peer Multidimensional Overlays: Approximating Complex Structures|journal=Principles of Distributed Systems|volume=4878|issue=|pages=315–328|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-77096-1_23|isbn=978-3-540-77095-4|postscript=.|citeseerx=10.1.1.626.2980}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Metrized Small World&lt;ref name="msw2014"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Malkov|first1=Yury|last2=Ponomarenko|first2=Alexander|last3=Krylov|first3=Vladimir|last4=Logvinov|first4=Andrey|year=2014|title=Approximate nearest neighbor algorithm based on navigable small world graphs|journal=Information Systems|volume=45|pages=61–68|doi=10.1016/j.is.2013.10.006|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and HNSW&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; algorithms for the general case of spaces with a distance function. These works were preceded by a pioneering paper by Toussaint, where he introduced a concept of a ''relative neighborhood'' graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Toussaint|first1=Godfried|date=1980|title=The relative neighbourhood graph of a finite planar set|journal=Pattern Recognition|volume=12|issue=4|pages=261–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Locality sensitive hashing====

[[Locality sensitive hashing]] (LSH) is a technique for grouping points in space into 'buckets' based on some distance metric operating on the points. Points that are close to each other under the chosen metric are mapped to the same bucket with high probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=A. Rajaraman  |author2=J. Ullman |lastauthoramp=yes | url=http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds.html |title=Mining of Massive Datasets, Ch. 3 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nearest neighbor search in spaces with small intrinsic dimension====

The [[cover tree]] has a theoretical bound that is based on the dataset's [[doubling constant]]. The bound on search time is ''O''(''c''&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') where ''c''  is the [[Expansivity constant|expansion constant]] of the dataset.

====Projected radial search====

In the special case where the data is a dense 3D map of geometric points, the projection geometry of the sensing technique can be used to dramatically simplify the search problem.
This approach requires that the 3D data is organized by a projection to a two dimensional grid and assumes that the data is spatially smooth across neighboring grid cells with the exception of object boundaries.
These assumptions are valid when dealing with 3D sensor data in applications such as surveying, robotics and stereo vision but may not hold for unorganized data in general.
In practice this technique has an average search time of ''O''(''1'')  or ''O''(''K'')  for the ''k''-nearest neighbor problem when applied to real world stereo vision data.
&lt;ref name=panSearch/&gt;

====Vector approximation files====

In high dimensional spaces, tree indexing structures become useless because an increasing percentage of the nodes need to be examined anyway. To speed up linear search, a compressed version of the feature vectors stored in RAM is used to prefilter the datasets in a first run. The final candidates are determined in a second stage using the uncompressed data from the disk for distance calculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Approximation-Based Data Structure for Similarity Search|last1=Weber|first1=Roger|last2=Blott|first2=Stephen|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/83e4/e3281411ffef40654a4b5d29dae48130aefb.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Compression/clustering based search====
The VA-file approach is a special case of a compression based search, where each feature component is compressed uniformly and independently. The optimal compression technique in multidimensional spaces is [[Vector Quantization]] (VQ), implemented through clustering. The database is clustered and the most "promising" clusters are retrieved. Huge gains over VA-File, tree-based indexes and sequential scan have been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Adaptive cluster-distance bounding for similarity search in image databases|last1=Ramaswamy|first1=Sharadh|last2=Rose|first2=Kenneth|journal=ICIP|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Adaptive cluster-distance bounding for high-dimensional indexing|last1=Ramaswamy|first1=Sharadh|last2=Rose|first2=Kenneth|journal=TKDE|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also note the parallels between clustering and LSH.

==Variants==

There are numerous variants of the NNS problem and the two most well-known are the [[K-nearest neighbor algorithm|''k''-nearest neighbor search]] and the [[ε-approximate nearest neighbor search]].

===&lt;span id="K-nearest neighbor"&gt; ''k''-nearest neighbors &lt;/span&gt;===

[[K-nearest neighbor algorithm|''k''-nearest neighbor search]] identifies the top ''k'' nearest neighbors to the query.  This technique is commonly used in predictive analytics to estimate or classify a point based on the consensus of its neighbors. ''k''-nearest neighbor graphs are graphs in which every point is connected to its ''k'' nearest neighbors.

===Approximate nearest neighbor===
In some applications it may be acceptable to retrieve a "good guess" of the nearest neighbor. In those cases, we can use an algorithm which doesn't guarantee to return the actual nearest neighbor in every case, in return for improved speed or memory savings. Often such an algorithm will find the nearest neighbor in a majority of cases, but this depends strongly on the dataset being queried.

Algorithms that support the approximate nearest neighbor search include [[Locality-sensitive hashing#LSH algorithm for nearest neighbor search|locality-sensitive hashing]], [[best bin first]] and [[balanced box-decomposition tree]] based search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=S.|last1=Arya|author2-link=David Mount|first2=D. M.|last2=Mount|author3-link=Nathan Netanyahu|first3=N. S.|last3=Netanyahu|first4=R.|last4=Silverman|first5=A.|last5=Wu|title=An optimal algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor searching|journal= Journal of the ACM|volume=45|number=6|pages=891–923|date=1998|url=http://www.cse.ust.hk/faculty/arya/pub/JACM.pdf|doi=10.1145/293347.293348|citeseerx=10.1.1.15.3125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nearest neighbor distance ratio===

[[Nearest neighbor distance ratio]] do not apply the threshold on the direct distance from the original point to the challenger neighbor but on a ratio of it depending on the distance to the previous neighbor. It is used in [[Content-based image retrieval|CBIR]] to retrieve pictures through a "query by example" using the similarity between local features. More generally it is involved in several [[Pattern matching|matching]] problems.

===Fixed-radius near neighbors===

[[Fixed-radius near neighbors]] is the problem where one wants to efficiently find all points given in [[Euclidean space]] within a given fixed distance from a specified point. The data structure should work on a distance which is fixed however the query point is arbitrary.

===All nearest neighbors===

For some applications (e.g. [[entropy estimation]]), we may have ''N'' data-points and wish to know which is the nearest neighbor ''for every one of those N points''. This could of course be achieved by running a nearest-neighbor search once for every point, but an improved strategy would be an algorithm that exploits the information redundancy between these ''N'' queries to produce a more efficient search. As a simple example: when we find the distance from point ''X'' to point ''Y'', that also tells us the distance from point ''Y'' to point ''X'', so the same calculation can be reused in two different queries.

Given a fixed dimension, a semi-definite positive norm (thereby including every  [[lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; norm]]), and ''n'' points in this space, the nearest neighbour of every point can be found in ''O''(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') time and the ''m'' nearest neighbours of every point can be found in ''O''(''mn''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Primary Care Progress (PCP)''' is a national [[non-profit organization]] advocating for and facilitating the revitalization of [[primary care]] in the United States [[health care]] system. It trains and organizes an interprofessional network of care providers and trainees - doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, physician assistants and others - and is inspired by what a 2009 report by the Network for Excellence in Health Innovation ([[NEHI]]) described as a crisis in primary care delivery: an increased demand on primary care by older, sicker patients and decreased supply of primary care practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remaking Primary Care: From Crisis to Opportunity|url=http://www.nehi.net/writable/publication_files/file/primary_care_from_crisis_to_opportunity_background_paper.pdf|publisher=Network for Excellence in Health Innovation|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence shows primary care provides better care at lower cost, yet when compared to medical specialty disciplines it is funded less in the United States than any other developed country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A new Center for Primary Care|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/10/hms-launches-center-for-primary-care/|newspaper=Harvard Gazette|date=Oct 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Primary care providers are generally overworked and underpaid compared to specialists, and many are disillusioned. This has resulted in fewer and fewer students choosing primary care training, and many providers retiring early or switching careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A new Center for Primary Care|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/10/hms-launches-center-for-primary-care/|newspaper=Harvard Gazette|date=Oct 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, PCP offers a community for primary care providers, trainees and faculty to connect and support each other. It provides relational [[leadership development]] training and coaching for building health care teams, improving primary care delivery and organizing for change. PCP focuses on students and trainees through its network of over 50 chapters at health professions institutions around the country. Chapters initiatives range from launching student-run free clinics, to changing curriculums, to organizing their local primary care community.

PCP partners with [[Jeffrey Brenner]]’s Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers and the [[Association of American Medical Colleges]] on the Interprofessional Student Hotspotting Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Hotspotting Mini-Grant Project|url=https://www.aamc.org/initiatives/hotspotter/|publisher=Association of American Medical Colleges}}&lt;/ref&gt; an initiative providing teams of health professions students with the knowledge and opportunity to work with high-risk patients to improve their care.

== Media coverage ==
In 2010, PCP president and co-founder Dr. Andrew Morris-Singer discussed on CNN the crisis in primary care and what is being done to address it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primary Care Progress on CNN|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXqe6w9r8Ss|publisher=CNN|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCP’s role in the creation of [[Harvard Medical School]]’s Center for Primary Care - which included a series of town hall meetings with hundreds of attendees - was described in a ''[[Harvard Gazette]]'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A new Center for Primary Care|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/10/hms-launches-center-for-primary-care/|newspaper=Harvard Gazette|date=Oct 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, PCP was featured in the [[American College of Physicians]]’ IMpact Newsletter as a “new national organization dedicated to engaging local communities to promote primary care, innovate in care delivery and prepare the next generation of leaders in primary care” by “building a grassroots network of advocates who share the vision of a health care system built on a robust foundation of primary care.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primary Care Progress Engages Trainees in Transformation of Primary Care|url=https://www.acponline.org/medical_students/impact/archives/2011/02/feature/|publisher=American College of Physicians|date=Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, President Morris-Singer wrote a blog post for KevinMD.com calling for a primary care “workforce surge,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It’s time for a primary care workforce surge|url=http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2012/03/time-primary-care-workforce-surge.html|publisher=KevinMD.com|date=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another for the Health Care Blog on revitalizing the primary care training “pipeline” through a multifaceted approach to overcome the financial, academic, cultural and political challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reviving the Pipeline: A Call to Action For All|url=http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2012/08/11/reviving-the-pipeline-a-call-to-action-for-all/|publisher=The Health Care Blog|date=Aug 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also featured in a ''New York Times'' article on initiatives encouraging students to consider primary care careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luring Students Into Family Medicine|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/us/10iht-educlede10.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all|newspaper=The New York Times|date=Sep 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representing PCP, in 2013 Dr. Morris-Singer was a panelist for a Congressional briefing on primary care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why We Need Robust Primary Care in the US, and What Congress Can Do to Help|url=http://www.primarycareprogress.org/connect/events/item/14/161|date=March 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCP was also featured in 2013 articles on the primary care crisis by the Associated Press&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newly insured to deepen primary care doctor gap|url=https://news.yahoo.com/newly-insured-deepen-primary-care-doctor-gap-141711587.html|publisher=Associated Press|date=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Association of Health Care Journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Future of primary care: Who will take care of you?|url=http://healthjournalism.org/blog/2013/05/future-of-primary-care-who-will-take-care-of-you/|publisher=Association of Health Care Journalists|date=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, MedPage Today published a piece about Primary Care Progress’ [[grassroots]] efforts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grassroots Group Aims to Renew Primary Care|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/PrimaryCare/GeneralPrimaryCare/45977|publisher=MedPage Today|date=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Atlantic’s story “Why I’m Becoming a Primary Care Doctor” included insight from President Morris-Singer on the stigmatization of primary care careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why I'm Becoming a Primary-Care Doctor|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/why-im-becoming-a-primary-care-doctor/379231/|magazine=The Atlantic|date=Sep 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New England Public Radio highlighted the work of PCP in two 2015 pieces about the future of primary care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Path To Primary Care: Who Will Be The Next Generation Of Frontline Doctors|url=http://nepr.net/news/2014/12/31/the-path-to-primary-care-who-will-be-the-next-generation-of-frontline-doctors//379231/|publisher=New England Public Radio|date=Jan 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raising The Stakes For Primary Care: Advocates Try To Make Field More Attractive|url=http://nepr.net/news/2015/01/23/raising-the-stakes-for-primary-care-advocates-try-to-make-field-more-attractive/|publisher=New England Public Radio|date=Jan 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  '''''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy''''' (''PRIA'') is the journal of the [[Royal Irish Academy]], founded in 1785 to promote the study of [[science]], [[polite literature]], and [[antiquities]]. It was known as several titles over the years:
*1836-1866: ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy''
*1870-1884: ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Science''
*1879: ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Polite Literature and Antiquities''
*1889-1901: ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy''

In 1902, the journal split into three sections ''Section A: Mathematical and Physical Sciences'', ''Section B: Biological, Geological, and Chemical Science'' and ''Section C: Archaeology, Culture, History, Literature''. ''Section A'' is now published as ''Mathematical Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy'' since 1998, and ''Section B'' is now published as ''Biology and Environment: Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy''. ''Section C'' is now ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy: Archaeology, Culture, History, Literature''.

'''Robert Louis Geddes''', (born December 7, 1923) is an American [[architect]], planner, writer, educator, former principal of the firm Geddes Brecher Qualls Cunningham (GBQC), and dean emeritus of the [[Princeton University School of Architecture]] (1965-1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soa.princeton.edu/content/robert-geddes|title=Robert Geddes|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As principal of GBQC, select major projects include Pender Labs at the [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], the [[Philadelphia Police Department|Philadelphia Police Headquarters]], the [[Liberty State Park]] master plan, the [[Philadelphia]] Center City master plan, and his best-known work, the Dining Commons, Birch Garden, and Academic Building at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. He is a [[Fellow of the American Institute of Architects]]; recipient of honorary doctorates from [[Princeton University]], [[City College of New York]], and the [[New Jersey Institute of Technology|New Jersey School of Architecture/NJIT]]; recipient of the Topaz Award from the [[American Institute of Architects]] and the [[Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture]], and, along with his firm, is the recipient of the [[Architecture Firm Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soa.princeton.edu/content/robert-geddes|title=Robert Geddes|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Geddes was born Robert Leon Goldberg on December 7, 1923 in [[Philadelphia]], the only child of Louis J. Geddes (born Goldberg) and Kate Geddes (born Malmed), both of Ukrainian-Jewish families settled in [[Woodbine, New Jersey]] by [[Maurice de Hirsch]]. He grew up and attended elementary school in [[Ventnor City, New Jersey]];&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Eugenia. [https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/174487446/ "With an eye on the human element, an architect gives substance to ideas"], ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', May 6, 1984. Accessed August 8, 2018. "Born in Philadelphia in 1923, he grew up in Ventnor."&lt;/ref&gt; John Burroughs Middle School in the [[Hancock Park, Los Angeles]] neighborhood of Los Angeles; and graduated from [[Atlantic City High School]] in 1941.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} He started university studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], transferring to [[Yale University]] in the fall of 1942 due to concerns over transcontinental travel after the start of World War II. His university studies were interrupted by three years in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] from 1942 to 1945.  He left Yale in 1947 for the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], where he earned an M. Arch. in 1950.

==Professional career==
'''Architect'''

In 1953, he co-founded a collaborative practice, Geddes Brecher Qualls Cunningham: Architects (also known as GBQC Architects), in Philadelphia, later adding an office in Princeton. Prior to founding GBQC, he worked briefly for Hugh Stubbins, Jr. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. GBQC won national and international competitions and awards, starting with being runner-up in the Sydney Opera House design competition (1955). He was GBQC design partner or co-partner for the Pender Labs at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania; the Police Headquarters of the City of Philadelphia; Richard Stockton College in New Jersey; Hill Hall at Rutgers University-Newark; the College of Liberal Arts of Southern Illinois University; the Architects Housing in Trenton, New Jersey; Princeton Community Housing’s Griggs Farm neighborhood; and probably best known, the Dining Hall and Birch Garden quad at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He was elected a Fellow of the National Academy of Design, and GBQC was awarded the highest professional honor of the American Institute for Architects, the Architecture Firm Award (1979), for “design quality, respect for the environment, and social concern.”

'''Urbanist'''

He was the urban design consultant for the Center City Plan of Philadelphia (1988), and for the Third Regional Plan of New York for the Regional Plan Association (1996). GBQC won first prize in the international design competition for Vienna-South urban extension (1972), and the GBQC master plan for Liberty State Park was exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art (1979). He worked with the City University of New York’s Newman Institute on alternatives for the Hudson Yards in midtown Manhattan. He co-founded the civic association, Princeton Future, which created the concept design for the new plaza, housing and parking in downtown Princeton, New Jersey. For the United Nations Center for Human Settlements, he directed the “UNCHS Conference on Cities in North America”, produced its report “Cities in Our Future”, published by Island Press, and wrote for the journal American Prospect, “Metropolis Unbound: The Sprawling American City and the Search for Alternatives.”

'''Educator'''

After studying at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in the post-war Walter Gropius and Joseph Hudnut era, he taught architecture and civic design at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design (formerly University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Fine Arts) from 1951 to 1965.

He moved to Princeton University in 1965 to become the first Dean of the School of Architecture, and is now William Kennan Professor Emeritus. Under his leadership over 17 years, the School of Architecture emerged as a major center for the exchange of architectural ideas, while retaining its small size and close connections with the rest of the university.

In 1990, he was appointed the Henry Luce Professor of Architecture, Urbanism, and History at New York University, and was elected a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities. 
He pioneered in connecting architecture with the humanities and social sciences, and with public affairs and urban design, and is best known for his undergraduate course at Princeton and NYU, Architecture 101, “Buildings, Landscapes, and Cities.” He was co-author of the Princeton Report on Architectural Education for the American Institute of Architects (1967).

==Regulation==
===United States===
[[File:Hyperion plant.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Hyperion sewage treatment plant|Hyperion Wastewater Treatment Plant]] in Los Angeles, California is one of the largest municipal plants in the United States.]]
[[Sewage treatment]] systems in the United States are subject to the [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) and are regulated by federal and [[U.S. state|state]] environmental agencies. In most states, local sewage plants receive discharge permits from state agencies; in the remaining states and [[Insular area#Inhabited 2|territories]], permits are issued by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-state-program-information#tab-2 |title=NPDES State Program Information |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-02-06 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment plants, known as [[publicly owned treatment works]] (POTW) in CWA parlance, must protect the health and welfare of the local population by ensuring that wastewater does not contaminate the local potable water supply, nor violate additional [[Clean Water Act#Water Quality Standards Program|water quality standards]] that protect the ecological health of the water body. 

The basic national standard for U.S. municipal treatment plants is the '''Secondary Treatment Regulation'''.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (1989). "Secondary Treatment Regulation." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{uscfr|40|133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most plants in the U.S. must meet this [[secondary treatment]] standard. The permit authority (state agency or EPA) can compel a POTW to meet a higher standard, if there are applicable water quality standards for the receiving water body. For water bodies with stringent standards, such as [[Lake Tahoe]], POTWs must treat their discharges to [[Sewage treatment#Tertiary treatment|tertiary treatment]] levels, and then pump all treated water out of the drainage basin so that no effluent ever drains to a certain body of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-limits |title=NPDES Permit Limits |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-11-29 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such higher standards may require the POTW to construct improvements to its plant(s). If not in compliance with its permit and regulations, POTWs may be subject to heavy fines. Regulation is therefore often the driving force behind increasing sewage treatment costs in the United States, and is directly linked to the high cost of constructing or expanding a sewage treatment facility.

Many large cities in the U.S. operate [[combined sewer]]s, which collect sewage and [[stormwater]] runoff in a single pipe system leading to the treatment plant. Combined sewers can cause serious water pollution problems due to combined sewer overflows, which are caused by large variations in flow between dry and wet weather. These overflows can lead to violation of the Secondary Treatment Regulation and/or water quality standards. Discharge permits for these POTWs typically have additional requirements that require facility improvements to reduce or eliminate the overflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/combined-sewer-overflows-csos |title=Combined Sewer Overflows |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-12-16 |website=NPDES |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
In England and Wales, [[Ofwat]] regulates charges and service standards. In [[England]] environmental standards and their achievement for sewage disposal are regulated by the [[Environment Agency]]. In [[Wales]] environmental regulation is undertaken by [[Natural Resources Wales]]. In [[Scotland]] the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]] fulfils the environmental regulation role and the [[Water Industry Commission for Scotland]] undertakes the economic regulatory role.

==Administration==
===United States===
Sewer systems are usually administered on the local level, usually citywide, and usually by the city itself. These systems, which may operate independently or as a subdivision of a city or other municipal agency, are typically operated as ''Enterprises'', meaning that they produce enough revenues to fund their own activities.

Revenues are usually generated through two charges to customers: ''connection fees'' and ''use charges''. Connection fees are charged once to new customers as they connect to the sanitary sewer collection system, and are usually designed to recover [[capital investments]] made by the enterprise to serve its customers. Use charges are periodic charges for ongoing use of the system, and are designed to recover [[operations and maintenance]] expenses. Both connection fees and use charges are typically proportionate to the amount and strength of wastewater expected to be generated by each customer. Therefore, a single family residence would pay much smaller fees and charges than a food processing plant.

Some POTWs are eligible for low-interest loans to finance system improvements, from the [[Clean Water State Revolving Fund]]. This program is administered by EPA and state agencies, using a combination of federal and state funds.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2012). [http://water.epa.gov/grants_funding/cwsrf/cwsrf_index.cfm "Clean Water State Revolving Fund."]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In [[England]] sewerage and sewage disposal is undertaken by relatively few large private companies, including several multi-national companies. In [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]] a "not for profit" company is the responsible body, however in Wales almost all the operational work is sub-[[subcontractor|contract]]ed by others. Charges to domestic users are based either on the metered volume of incoming water or on the notional value of the property ([[Rates (tax)|rateable]] basis).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28300">{{Semiotics}}
In [[semiotics]], a '''sign''' is anything that [[communicate|communicates]] a [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] that is not the sign itself to the interpreter of the sign. The meaning can be intentional such as a word uttered with a specific meaning, or unintentional, such as a [[symptom]] being a sign of a particular medical condition. Signs can communicate through any of the [[senses]], visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, or taste.

Two major theories describe the way signs acquire the ability to transfer information. Both theories understand the defining property of the sign as a relation between a number of elements. In the tradition of semiotics developed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (referred to as semiology) the sign relation is dyadic, consisting only of a form of the sign (the signifier) and its meaning (the signified). Saussure saw this relation as being essentially arbitrary (the principle of '''semiotic arbitrariness'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;), motivated only by social convention. Saussure's theory has been particularly influential in the study of linguistic signs. The other major [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs|semiotic theory]], developed by [[C. S. Peirce]], defines the sign as a triadic relation as "something that stands for something, to someone in some capacity"&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcel Danesi]] and Paul Perron, ''Analyzing Cultures''.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that a sign is a relation between the sign vehicle (the specific physical form of the sign), a sign object (the aspect of the world that the sign carries meaning about) and an interpretant (the meaning of the sign as understood by an interpreter). According to Peirce signs can be divided by the type of relation that holds the sign relation together as either [[icon]]s, indices or [[symbols]]. Icons are those signs that signify by means of similarity between sign vehicle and sign object (e.g. a portrait, or a map), indices are those that signify by means of a direct relation of contiguity or causality between sign vehicle and sign object (e.g. a symptom), and symbols are those that signify through a law or arbitrary social convention.

==Dyadic signs==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Intension]] --&gt;
According to [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] (1857–1913), a sign is composed of the ''signifier''&lt;ref name="definition"&gt;Mardy S. Ireland defines a signifier as:&lt;br&gt;A unit of something (i.e., a word, gesture) that can carry ambiguous/multiple meanings (e.g., as U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] once said, "It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is', is")&lt;br&gt;{{cite book

}} p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; (''signifiant''), and the ''signified'' (''signifié''). These cannot be conceptualized as separate entities but rather as a mapping from significant differences in sound to potential (correct) differential denotation. The Saussurean sign exists only at the level of the [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] system, in which signs are defined by their relative and hierarchical privileges of co-occurrence. It is thus a common misreading of Saussure to take signifiers to be anything one could speak, and signifieds as things in the world. In fact, the relationship of language to [[langue and parole|parole]] (or speech-in-context) is and always has been a theoretical problem for linguistics (cf. Roman Jakobson's famous essay "Closing Statement: Linguistics and Poetics" et al.).

A famous thesis by Saussure states that the relationship between a sign and the real-world thing it denotes is an arbitrary one. There is not a natural relationship between a word and the object it refers to, nor is there a causal relationship between the inherent properties of the object and the nature of the sign used to denote it. For example, there is nothing about the physical quality of paper that requires denotation by the phonological sequence ‘paper’. There is, however, what Saussure called ‘relative motivation’: the possibilities of signification of a signifier are constrained by the [[compositionality]] of elements in the linguistic system (cf. [[Emile Benveniste]]'s paper on the arbitrariness of the sign in the first volume of his papers on general linguistics).  In other words, a word is only available to acquire a new meaning if it is identifiably ''different'' from all the other words in the language and it has no existing meaning. [[Structuralism]] was later based on this idea that it is only within a given system that one can define the distinction between the levels of system and use, or the semantic "value" of a sign.

==Triadic signs==
[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) proposed a different theory. Unlike Saussure who approached the conceptual question from a study of [[linguistics]] and [[phonology]], Peirce, the so-called father of the [[Pragmaticism|Pragmatist school]] of philosophy, extended the concept of sign to embrace many other forms. He considered "word" to be only one particular kind of sign, and characterized sign as any mediational means to [[understanding]]. He covered not only artificial, linguistic, and symbolic signs, but also all semblances (such as kindred sensible qualities), and all indicators (such as mechanical reactions). He counted as symbols all terms, propositions, and arguments whose interpretation is based upon convention or habit, even apart from their expression in particular languages. He held that "all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs".&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., ''Collected Papers'', v. 5, paragraph 448 footnote, from "The Basis of Pragmaticism" in 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; The setting of Peirce's study of signs is philosophical logic, which he defined as formal semiotic,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S., 1902, Application to the Carnegie Institution, Memoir 12, "On the Definition of Logic", [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-05.htm#m12 Eprint]. Note that by "logic" Peirce means a part of philosophy, not the mathematics of logic. (See [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)]].&lt;/ref&gt; and characterized as a normative field following esthetics and ethics, as more basic than metaphysics,&lt;ref&gt;On his classifications, see Peirce, C.S. (1903), ''Collected Peirce'' v. 1, paragraphs 180–202 [http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/cl_o_sci_03.htm Eprint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105121054/http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/cl_o_sci_03.htm |date=2011-11-05 }} and (1906) "The Basis of Pragmaticism" in ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 372–3. For relevant quotes, see "Philosophy" and "Logic" in the ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and as the art of devising methods of research.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S., 1882, "Introductory Lecture on the Study of Logic" delivered September 1882, ''Johns Hopkins University Circulars'', v. 2, n. 19, pp. 11–12, November 1892, ''Google Book'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=E0YFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22art+of+devising+methods+of+research%22 Eprint]. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers'' v. 7, paragraphs 59–76, ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp. 210–14, and ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'' v. 4, pp. 378–82.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that, since all thought takes time, all thought is in signs,&lt;ref name=QCCF&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1868), "Questions concerning certain Faculties claimed for Man" (''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/question/qu-frame.htm Eprint]), ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' vol. 2, pp. 103–114. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 213–63.&lt;/ref&gt; that all thought has the form of inference (even when not conscious and deliberate),&lt;ref name=QCCF/&gt; and that, as inference, "logic is rooted in the social principle", since inference depends on a standpoint that, in a sense, is unlimited.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1878) "The Doctrine of Chances", ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 604–15, 1878, reprinted in ''Collected Papers'', v. 2, paragraphs 645–68, ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'' v. 3, pp. 276–90, and ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp. 142–54. "...death makes the number of our risks, the number of our inferences, finite, and so makes their mean result uncertain. The very idea of probability and of reasoning rests on the assumption that this number is indefinitely great. .... ...logicality inexorably requires that our interests shall not be limited. .... Logic is rooted in the social principle."&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a theory not of language in particular, but rather of the production of meaning, and it rejects the idea of a static relationship between a sign and what it represents: its ''object''. Peirce believed that signs are meaningful through recursive relationships that arise in sets of three.

Even when a sign represents by a resemblance or factual connection independent of interpretation, the sign is a sign only insofar as it is at least potentially interpretable by a mind and insofar as the sign is a determination of a mind or at least a ''quasi-mind'', that functions as if it were a mind, for example in crystals and the work of bees&lt;ref&gt;See under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/quasimind.html Quasi-mind]" in the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt;—the focus here is on sign action in general, not on psychology, linguistics, or social studies (fields Peirce also pursued).

A sign depends on an object in a way that enables (and, in a sense, determines) an interpretation, an ''interpretant'', to depend on the object ''as the sign depends on the object''. The interpretant, then, is a further sign of the object, and thus enables and determines still further interpretations, further interpretant signs. The process, called ''[[semiosis]]'', is irreducibly triadic, Peirce held, and is logically structured to perpetuate itself. It is what defines sign, object, and interpretant in general.&lt;ref&gt;For Peirce's definitions of ''sign'' and ''semiosis'', see under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/sign.html Sign]" and "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/semiosis.html Semiosis, semeiosy]" in the ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''; and "[http://perso.numericable.fr/robert.marty/semiotique/access.htm 76 definitions of sign by C. S. Peirce]" collected by Robert Marty. Peirce's "[http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/ep/ep2/ep2book/ch02/ep2ch2.htm What Is a Sign]" (MS 404 of 1894, ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 4–10) provides intuitive help.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] (1990: 7) put it, "the process of referring effected by the sign is ''infinite''." (Note also that Peirce used the word "determine" in the sense not of strict determinism, but of effectiveness that can vary like an influence.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Peirce said "determined (i.e., specialized, ''bestimmt'')" in a letter to William James, dated 1909, see p. 492 in ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Peirce further characterized the three [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)|semiotic elements]] as follows:&lt;ref&gt;For Peirce's definitions of ''immediate object'' and the rest, see the ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Sign'' (or ''representamen''&lt;ref&gt;Pronounced with the “a” long and stressed: {{IPAc-en|ˌ|r|ɛ|p|r|ᵻ|z|ɛ|n|ˈ|t|eɪ|m|ə|n}}. See [[wiktionary:representamen]].&lt;/ref&gt;): that which represents the denoted object (cf. Saussure's "signifier").
# ''Object'' (or ''semiotic object''): that which the sign represents (or as some put it, [[Encode (semiotics)|encodes]]). It can be anything thinkable, a law, a fact, or even a possibility (a semiotic object could even be fictional, such as [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]); those are partial objects; the total object is the [[universe of discourse]], the totality of objects in that world to which one attributes the partial object. For example, perturbation of Pluto's orbit is a sign about Pluto, but not only about Pluto. The object may be
## ''immediate'' to the sign, the object as represented in the sign, or
## ''dynamic'', the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded.
# ''Interpretant'' (or ''interpretant sign''): a sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a further sign by interpreting (or, as some put it, [[Decode (semiotics)|decoding]]) the sign. The interpretant may be:
##''immediate'' to the sign, a kind of possibility, all that the sign is suited to immediately express, for instance a word's usual meaning;
##''dynamic'', that is, the meaning as formed into an actual effect, for example an individual translation or a state of agitation, or
##''final'' or ''normal'', that is, the ultimate meaning that inquiry taken far enough would be destined to reach. It is a kind of norm or ideal end, with which an actual interpretant may, at most, coincide.

Peirce explained that signs mediate between their objects and their interpretants in semiosis, the triadic process of determination. In semiosis a ''first'' is determined or influenced to be a sign by a ''second'', as its object. The object determines the sign to determine a ''third'' as an interpretant. ''Firstness'' itself is one of [[Categories (Peirce)|Peirce's three categories of all phenomena]], and is quality of feeling. Firstness is associated with a vague state of mind as feeling and a sense of the possibilities, with neither compulsion nor reflection. In semiosis the mind discerns an appearance or phenomenon, a potential sign. ''Secondness'' is reaction or resistance, a category associated with moving from possibility to determinate actuality. Here, through experience outside of and collateral to the given sign or sign system, one recalls or discovers the object the sign refers to, for example when a sign consists in a chance semblance of an absent but remembered object. It is through one's collateral experience&lt;ref&gt;In that context Peirce speaks of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms. See pp. 404–9 in "Pragmatism" in ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 2. Ten quotes on collateral experience from Peirce provided by [[Joseph Morton Ransdell|Joseph Ransdell]] can be viewed [http://lyris.ttu.edu/read/messages?id=57101 here] at peirce-l's Lyris archive.&lt;/ref&gt; that the object determines the sign to determine an interpretant. ''Thirdness'' is representation or mediation, the category associated with signs, generality, rule, continuity, habit-taking, and purpose. Here one forms an interpretant expressing a meaning or ramification of the sign about the object. When a second sign is considered, the initial interpretant may be confirmed, or new possible meanings may be identified. As each new sign is addressed, more interpretants, themselves signs, emerge. It can involve a mind's reading of nature, people, mathematics, anything.

Peirce generalized the communicational idea of utterance and interpretation of a sign, to cover all signs:&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1906), "Prolegomena To an Apology For Pragmaticism", ''[[The Monist]]'', v. XVI, n. 4, pp. 492–546, see pp. 523–4, ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA523 Eprint]. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers'' v. 4, paragraphs 530–72, see 551.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Admitting that connected Signs must have a Quasi-mind, it may further be declared that there can be no isolated sign. Moreover, signs require at least two Quasi-minds; a ''Quasi-utterer'' and a'' Quasi-interpreter''; and although these two are at one (i.e., are one mind) in the sign itself, they must nevertheless be distinct. In the Sign they are, so to say, ''welded''. Accordingly, it is not merely a fact of human Psychology, but a necessity of Logic, that every logical evolution of thought should be dialogic.}}

According to Nattiez, writing with [[Jean Molino]], the tripartite definition of sign, object, and interpretant is based on the "[[Trace (semiology)|trace]]" or [[neutral level]], Saussure's "sound-image" (or "signified", thus Peirce's "representamen"). Thus, "a symbolic form...is not some 'intermediary' in a process of 'communication' that transmits the meaning intended by the author to the audience; it is instead the result of a complex ''process'' of creation (the [[poietic]] process) that has to do with the form as well as the content of the work; it is also the point of departure for a complex process of reception (the ''esthesic'' process that ''reconstructs'' a 'message'").
(ibid, p.&amp;nbsp;17)

Peirce's theory of the sign therefore offered a powerful analysis of the signification system, its codes, and its processes of inference and learning—because the focus was often on natural or cultural context rather than linguistics, which only analyses usage in slow-time whereas human semiotic interaction in the real world often has a chaotic blur of language and signal exchange. Nevertheless, the implication that triadic relations are structured to perpetuate themselves leads to a level of complexity not usually experienced in the routine of message creation and interpretation. Hence, different ways of expressing the idea have developed.

===Classes of triadic signs===
By 1903&lt;ref name=9signs/&gt; Peirce came to [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)|classify signs]] by three universal trichotomies dependent on his three categories (quality, fact, habit). He classified any sign:&lt;ref&gt;For more as to the definitions, terminology, and development of the classifications, see the ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''&lt;/ref&gt; 
# by what stands as the sign — either (''qualisign'', also called a ''tone'') a quality — or (''sinsign'', also called ''token'') an individual fact — or (''legisign'', also called ''type'') a rule, a habit;
# by how the sign stands for its object — either (''icon'') by its own quality, such that it resembles the object, regardless of factual connection and of interpretive rule of reference — or (''index'') by factual connection to its object, regardless of resemblance and of interpretive rule of reference — or (''symbol'') by rule or habit of interpreted reference to its object, regardless of resemblance and of factual connection; and
# by how the sign stands for its object to its interpretant — either (''rheme'', also called ''seme'',&lt;ref&gt;In 1902 Peirce used the word "seme" instead for an index, especially an indexical sinsign. See ''Collected Papers'' v. 2, paragraph 283.&lt;/ref&gt; such as a term) as regards quality or possibility, as if the sign were a qualisign, though it can be qualisign, sinsign, or legisign — or (''dicisign'', also called ''pheme'', such as a proposition) as regards fact, as if the sign were an index, though it can be index or symbol — or (''argument'', also called ''delome''&lt;ref&gt;Peirce said, "pronounce deeloam, from ''δήλωμα''", Peirce (1906), "Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmaticism", The Monist, v. 16, n. 4, pp. 492–546, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA507 507]. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers'' v. 4, paragraphs 530–572, see 538. [http://www.existentialgraphs.com/peirceoneg/prolegomena.htm Eprint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905164710/http://www.existentialgraphs.com/peirceoneg/prolegomena.htm |date=2007-09-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;) as regards rule or habit. This is the trichotomy of all signs as building blocks in an inference process.
* Any qualisign is an icon. Sinsigns include some icons and some indices. Legisigns include some icons, some indices, and all symbols.
* Any icon is a rheme. Indices (be they sinsigns or legisigns) include some rhemes and some dicisigns. Symbols include some rhemes, some dicisigns, and all arguments.
{{C. S. Peirce ninefold sign table}}
Because of those classificatory interdependences, the three trichotomies intersect to form ten (rather than 27) classes of signs. There are also various kinds of meaningful combination. Signs can be attached to one another. A photograph is an index with a meaningfully attached icon. Arguments are composed of dicisigns, and dicisigns are composed of rhemes. In order to be embodied, legisigns (types) need sinsigns (tokens) as their individual replicas or instances. A symbol depends as a sign on how it ''will'' be interpreted, regardless of resemblance or factual connection to its object; but the symbol's individual embodiment is an index to your experience of the object. A symbol is instanced by a specialized indexical sinsign. A symbol such as a sentence in a language prescribes qualities of appearance for its instances, and is itself a replica of a symbol such as a proposition apart from expression in a particular language. Peirce covered both semantic and syntactical issues in his theoretical grammar, as he sometimes called it. He regarded formal semiotic, as logic, as furthermore encompassing study of arguments ([[Abductive reasoning|hypothetical]], [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]]) and inquiry's methods including [[pragmatism]]; and as allied to but distinct from logic's pure mathematics.

Peirce sometimes referred to the “ground” of a sign. The ground is the pure abstraction of a quality.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1867), "[[s:On a New List of Categories|On a New List of Categories]]", ''Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences'', v. 7 (1868), pp. 287–98. (Delivered orally by Peirce in 1867 and distributed by him in 1867 as part of an extract).&lt;/ref&gt; A sign's ground is the ''respect'' in which the sign represents its object, e.g. as in [[literal and figurative language]]. For example, an icon ''presents'' a characteristic or quality attributed to an object, while a symbol ''imputes'' to an object a quality either presented by an icon or symbolized so as to evoke a mental icon.

Peirce called an icon apart from a label, legend, or other index attached to it, a "hypoicon", and divided the hypoicon into three classes: (a) the ''image'', which depends on a simple quality; (b) the ''diagram'', whose internal relations, mainly dyadic or so taken, represent by analogy the relations in something; and (c) the ''metaphor'', which represents the representative character of a sign by representing a parallelism in something else.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, ''Collected Papers'' v. 2, paragraphs 276–7, written circa 1902. See under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/diagram.html Diagram]" in the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; A diagram can be geometric, or can consist in an array of algebraic expressions, or even in the common form "All __ is ___" which is subjectable, like any diagram, to logical or mathematical transformations. Peirce held that mathematics is done by diagrammatic thinking — observation of, and experimentation on, diagrams. Peirce developed for deductive logic a system of visual [[existential graph]]s, which continue to be researched today.

==20th-century theories==
It is now agreed that the effectiveness of the acts that may convert the message into text (including speaking, writing, drawing, music and physical movements) depends upon ''the knowledge of the sender''. If the sender is not familiar with the current language, its codes and its culture, then he or she will not be able to say anything at all, whether as a visitor in a different language area or because of a medical condition such as [[aphasia]] (see [[Roman Jakobson]]).

Modern theories deny the [[Saussure|Saussurian]] distinction between signifier and signified&lt;!--implicit in SD--&gt;, and look for meaning not in the individual signs, but in their context and the framework of potential meanings that could be applied. Such theories assert that language is a collective memory or cultural history of all the different ways in which meaning has been communicated, and may to that extent, constitute all life's experiences (see [[Louis Hjelmslev]]). Hjelmslev did not consider the sign to be the smallest [[semiotic]] unit, as he believed it possible to decompose it further; instead, he considered the "internal structure of language" to be a system of ''[[figurae]]'', a concept somewhat related to that of [[figure of speech]],&lt;!--cites follow--&gt; which he considered to be the ultimate semiotic unity.&lt;ref name="Hjelmslev43"&gt;Hjelmslev [1943] ''[[Prolegomena]] to a Theory of Language'', pp.47, 65, 67, and cf. 6.26, 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beaugrande91"&gt;[[Robert de Beaugrande]] (1991) ''[Linguistic Theory: The Discourse of  Fundamental Works]'', section on [http://www.beaugrande.com/LINGTHERHjelmslev.htm Louis Hjelmslev].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Noth90"&gt;[[Nöth, Winfried]] (1990) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rHA4KQcPeNgC Handbook of semiotics]'', pp.66, 70-1 section 3&lt;/ref&gt;

This position implies that speaking is simply one more form of behaviour and changes the focus of attention from the text as language, to the text as a [[Knowledge representation|representation]] of purpose, a functional version of the [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]]. But, once the message has been transmitted, the text exists independently.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Hence, although the writers who co-operated to produce this page exist, they can only be represented by the signs actually selected and presented here. The interpretation process in the receiver's mind may attribute meanings completely different from those intended by the senders. But, why might this happen? Neither the sender nor the receiver of a text has a perfect grasp of all language. Each individual's relatively small ''stock'' of knowledge is the product of personal experience and their attitude to learning. When the [[audience]] receives the message, there will always be an excess of connotational meanings available to be applied to the particular signs in their context (no matter how relatively complete or incomplete their knowledge, the [[cognitive]] process is the same).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The first stage in understanding the message is therefore, to suspend or defer judgement until more information becomes available. At some point, the individual receiver decides which of all possible meanings represents the best possible fit. Sometimes, uncertainty may not be resolved, so meaning is indefinitely deferred, or a provisional or approximate meaning is allocated. More often, the receiver's desire for [[Closure (psychology)|closure]] (see [[Gestalt psychology]]) leads to simple meanings being attributed out of prejudices and without reference to the sender's intentions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Postmodern theory==
In [[critical theory]], the notion of sign is used variously. 

{{Quote|Many postmodernist theorists postulate a complete disconnection of the signifier and the signified. An [[Floating signifier|'empty' or 'floating signifier']] is variously defined as a signifier with a vague, highly variable, unspecifiable or non-existent signified. Such signifiers mean different things to different people: they may stand for many or even any signifieds; they may mean whatever their interpreters want them to mean.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Chandler, ''Semiotics: The Basics'', Routledge 2007, page 78&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Social science fiction''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[science fiction]], usually (but not necessarily) [[soft science fiction]], concerned less with [[technology in science fiction|technology]]/[[space opera]] and more with speculation about society. In other words, it "absorbs and discusses anthropology" and speculates about human behavior and interactions.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;"[http://archaeology.about.com/od/fictionstoriesandnovels/Archaeology_in_Fiction_Stories_and_Novels.htm Archaeology in Fiction, Stories, and Novels]". [[about.com]]. May 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploration of fictional societies is a significant aspect of science fiction, allowing it to perform predictive (''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895); ''[[The Final Circle of Paradise]]'', 1965) and precautionary (''[[Brave New World]]'', 1932; ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', 1949; ''[[Childhood's End]]'',  ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', 1953) functions, to criticize the contemporary world (''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', 1726; the [[Alexander Gromov|works of Alexander Gromov]], 1995 - Present) and to present solutions (''[[Walden Two]]'', ''[[Freedom™]]''), to portray alternative societies (''[[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky#Noon Universe|World of the Noon]]'') and to examine the implications of ethical principles, as for example in the [[Sergei Lukyanenko bibliography|works]] of [[Sergei Lukyanenko]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== In English ==

'''Social fiction''' is a broad term to describe any work of [[speculative fiction]] that features social commentary (as opposed to, say, hypothetical technology) in the foreground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/social-science-fiction|title=Social Science Fiction - Dictionary definition of Social Science Fiction - Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social science fiction is a subgenre thereof, where social commentary (cultural or political) takes place in a sci-fi universe. [[Utopian and dystopian fiction]] is a classic, polarized genre of social science fiction, although most works of science fiction can be interpreted as having social commentary of some kind or other as an important feature. It is not uncommon, therefore, for a sci-fi work to be labeled as social sci-fi as well as numerous other categories.

[[Thomas More]]'s book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516) represents an early example of the genre.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Another early classic writer, [[Jonathan Swift]], penned critical views on current society—his most famous work, ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1726), is an example of a novel that is partially social science fiction (with such classic sci-fi elements as pioneering in strange new worlds and experimenting with variations of the human anatomy) and partially high fantasy (e.g., fantastical races that satirize various sectors of society).

One of the writers who used science fiction to explore the sociology of  near-future topics was [[H. G. Wells]], with his classic ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895) revealing the human race diverging into separate branches of [[Eloi]]s and [[Morlock]]s as a consequence of [[Social class|class inequality]]: a happy pastoral society of Elois preyed upon by the Morlocks but yet needing them to keep their world functioning—a thinly veiled criticism of capitalist society, where the exploiter class, or the bourgeoisie, is symbolized by the useless, frivolous Elois, and the exploited working class, or the proletariat, is represented by the subterranean-dwelling, malnourished Morlocks. Wells' ''[[The Sleeper Awakes]]'' (1899, 1910) predicted the spirit of the 20th century: technically advanced, undemocratic and bloody. Next to prognoses of the future of society if current social problems persisted, as well as depictions of alien societies that are exaggerated versions of ours (exemplified by ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' of 1897), Wells also heavily criticized the then-popular concept of vivisection, experimental "psychiatry" and research that was done for the purpose of restructuring the human mind and memory (clearly emphasized in ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]'', 1896).

Other early examples of influential novels include ''[[Vril|Vril, the Power of the Coming Race]]'' (1871) by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]],  ''[[Erewhon]]'' (1872) by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], [[Looking Backward|''Looking Backward: 2000-1887'']] (1888) by [[Edward Bellamy]] and ''[[News from Nowhere]]'' (1890) by [[William Morris]]

In the U.S. the new trend of science fiction away from gadgets and space opera and toward speculation about the human condition{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} was championed in pulp magazines of the 1940s by authors such as [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and by [[Isaac Asimov]], who coined the term "social science fiction" to describe his own work.&lt;ref&gt;In his essay appearing in ''Modern Science Fiction: Its Meaning and Its Future'' (ed. [[Reginald Bretnor]], 1953).&lt;/ref&gt; The term is not often used today except in the context of referring specifically to the changes that took place in the 1940s,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} but the subgenre it defines is still a mainstay of science fiction.

Utopian fiction eventually gave birth to a negative and often more cynical genre, known as [[dystopia]]n: [[Aldous Huxley]]'s "negative utopia" ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) and, ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945) and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949) by [[George Orwell]]. "The thought-destroying force" of [[McCarthyism]] influenced [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1953). Examples of [[young adult fiction|young adult]] dystopian fiction include ''[[The Hunger Games (novel)|The Hunger Games]]'' (2008) by [[Suzanne Collins]], ''[[The House of the Scorpion]]'' (2002) by [[Nancy Farmer]], ''[[Divergent (novel)|Divergent]]'' (2011) by [[Veronica Roth]], ''[[The Maze Runner]]'' (2009) by [[James Dashner]], and ''[[Delirium (Lauren Oliver novel)|Delirium]]'' (2011) by [[Lauren Oliver]].

''[[The Chrysalids]]'' (1955) by [[John Wyndham]] explored the society of several telepathic children in a world hostile to such differences. [[Robert Sheckley]] studied polar civilizations of criminal and stability in his 1960 novel ''[[The Status Civilization]]''.

The modern era of social science fiction began with the 1960s,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} when authors such as [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Brian Aldiss]], [[William Gibson]] and [[Frank Herbert]] wrote novels and stories that reflected real-world political developments and ecological issues, but also experimented in creating hypothetical societies of the future or of parallel populated planets. Ellison's main theme was the protest against increasing militarism. [[Kurt Vonnegut]] wrote ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' (1969), which used the science-fiction storytelling device of [[time travel in fiction|time-travel]] to explore anti-war, moral, and sociological themes. [[Frederik Pohl]]'s series ''[[Gateway (novel)|Gateway]]'' (1977–2004) combined social science fiction with [[hard science-fiction]]. Modern exponents of social science fiction in the [[John W. Campbell|Campbellian]]/[[Robert A. Heinlein|Heinlein]] tradition include [[L. Neil Smith]] who wrote both ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' (1981) and ''[[Pallas (Heinlein)|Pallas]]'', which dealt with [[Alternate future|alternative "sideways in time" futures]] and what a libertarian society would look like. He is considered{{by whom|date=March 2015}} the heir to [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s [[individualism]] and [[libertarianism]] in science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Fitting, Peter. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20719029 "Utopias Beyond Our Ideals: The Dilemma of the Right-Wing Utopia."] Utopian Studies. Vol. 2, No. 1/2, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Today, the tradition is continued, although the term may be out of use. --&gt;[[Kim Stanley Robinson]] explored different models of the future in his ''[[Three Californias Trilogy]]'' (1984, 1988, 1990)&lt;!-- and carried out extensive studies of Mars colonization in ''[[Mars trilogy]]'' (1992, 1993, 1996) --&gt;.

''[[The Saga of Recluce]]'' (1991–present), by [[L. E. Modesitt, Jr.]] represents a fusion of science fiction and [[fantasy]] that can be described{{by whom|date=March 2015}} as social science fiction. The 13 books of the series describe the changing relationships between two technologically advanced cultures and the cultures of a primitive world to which each is involuntarily transported. Themes of gender stereotyping, sexism, ethics, economics, environmentalism and politics are explored in the course of the series, which examines the world through the eyes of all its protagonists.

[[Doris Lessing]] won the 2007 Nobel Prize for literature. Although mostly known for her mainstream works, she wrote numerous notable works of social science fiction, including ''[[Memoirs of a Survivor]]'' (1974), ''[[Briefing for a Descent into Hell]]'' (1971), the ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series (1974–1983), and ''[[The Cleft]]'' (2007).

==Changes in response to drought==
Drought and water stress have varying effects on specific leaf area. In a variety of species, drought decreases specific leaf area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Casper | first1 = B.

N. | last3 = Kempenich | first3 = H. | last4 = Seltzer | first4 = S. | last5 = Xavier | first5 = K. | year = 2001 | title = Drought prolongs leaf life span in the herbaceous desert perennial Cryptantha flava | url = | journal = Functional Ecology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 740–747 | doi=10.1046/j.0269-8463.2001.00583.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marron | first1 = N. | last2 = Dreyer | first2 = E. | last3 = Boudouresque | first3 = E. | last4 = Delay | first4 = D. | last5 = Petit | first5 = J.-M. | last6 = Delmotte | first6 = F.

G. | last2 = Lazo | first2 = Y. O. | last3 = Linares | first3 = J. C. | last4 = Luque | first4 = A. | last5 = Martínez | first5 = F. | last6 = Seco | first6 = J.

B. | last2 = Forseth | first2 = I. N. | last3 = Kempenich | first3 = H. | last4 = Seltzer | first4 = S. | last5 = Xavier | first5 = K. | year = 2001 | title = Drought prolongs leaf life span in the herbaceous desert perennial Cryptantha flava | url = | journal = Functional Ecology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 740–747 | doi=10.1046/j.0269-8463.2001.00583.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a logical observation, as a relative decrease in surface area would mean that there would be fewer ways for water to be lost. Species with typically low specific leaf area values are geared for the conservation of acquired resources, due to their large dry matter content, high concentrations of cell walls and secondary metabolites, and high leaf and root longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marron | first1 = N. | last2 = Dreyer | first2 = E. | last3 = Boudouresque | first3 = E. | last4 = Delay | first4 = D. | last5 = Petit | first5 = J.-M. | last6 = Delmotte | first6 = F. M. | last7 = Brignolas | first7 = F. | year = 2003 | title = Impact of successive drought and re-watering cycles on growth and specific leaf area of two Populus canadensis (Moench) clones,"Dorskamp"and "Luisa_Avanzo" | url = | journal = Tree physiology | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 1225–1235 | doi=10.1093/treephys/23.18.1225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some other species, such as Poplar trees, specific leaf area will decrease overall, but there will be  an increase in specific leaf area until the leaf has reached its final size. After the final size has been reached, the specific leaf area will then begin decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marron | first1 = N. | last2 = Dreyer | first2 = E. | last3 = Boudouresque | first3 = E. | last4 = Delay | first4 = D. | last5 = Petit | first5 = J.-M. | last6 = Delmotte | first6 = F. M. | last7 = Brignolas | first7 = F. | year = 2003 | title = Impact of successive drought and re-watering cycles on growth and specific leaf area of two Populus canadensis (Moench) clones,"Dorskamp"and "Luisa_Avanzo" | url = | journal = Tree physiology | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 1225–1235 | doi=10.1093/treephys/23.18.1225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research has shown increasing specific leaf area values in plants under water limitation. An example of increasing specific leaf area values as a result of drought stress is the birch tree species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aspelmeier | first1 = S. | last2 = Leuschner | first2 = C. | year = 2006 | title = Genotypic variation in drought response of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth): leaf and root morphology and carbon partitioning | url = | journal = Trees | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 42–52 | doi=10.1007/s00468-005-0011-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birch tree specific leaf area values significantly increased after two dry seasons, though the authors did note that, in typical cases, lowered specific leaf area values are seen as an adaptation to drought stress.

The '''State Institute for Music Research''' ({{lang-de|Staatliches Institut für Musikforschung}} or ''SIMPK'') is a [[Musicology|musicological]] research facility in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] for the study of [[Musical Instruments]], [[Music History]], [[Music Theory]] and [[Music technology]]. It is an agency of the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]] and operates the [[Berlin Musical Instrument Museum]].

==History==
The current Institute is a direct descendant of several institutions of the former [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. In 1888, a formalized collection of ancient musical instruments was established at the Prussian Royal Academy of Music. By 1902, the collection had grown substantially through the financial support of [[Wilhelm II]].  In 1919 [[Curt Sachs]], one of the founders of the field of [[organology]] (the study of musical instruments), was appointed the first Director of the instrument collection. In 1917, an Institute for Musicological Research was also founded under the patronage of [[Prince Adolf of Schaumburg-Lippe]] in [[Bückeburg]].

At the start of the [[Third Reich]] in 1933, Sachs was dismissed and forced to emigrate by the [[Nazi Party]]. In 1935 a new National Institute for German Music Research was founded in Berlin, led by [[Max Seiffert]], incorporating the old Royal College and the [[Bückeburg]] Institute. [[World War II]] then saw the nearly complete destruction of the Institute and the Museum. In 1943, the instruments, scores and library collections were evacuated from Berlin to protect them from [[Bombing of Berlin during World War II|Allied bombing]]. Despite extensive security, the majority were lost. In January 1945, "by Decree of the Reich Minister for Science, Education and Education", the Institute was closed. At war's end, only 700 of the original 4,000 musical instruments survived.

After the war, what remained of the Institute came under the direct control of the [[West Berlin]] city government and a painstaking reconstruction began, with a focus on the valuable instruments collection. In 1949 it was given accommodations at [[Charlottenburg Palace]]. On the 200th anniversary of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s death in 1950, the Institute held the first chamber music concert on historic instruments. In 1962 the Institute came under the administration of the newly created [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]], and the Department for Musical Acoustics was established in 1965 through a grant from the [[Fritz Thyssen]] Foundation. A ceremony was held to lay the foundation stone for the Institute's current building in 1979 on the [[Kulturforum]], which opened to the public in 1984.

==Organization==

===Division I: Musical Instruments Museum ===
The [[Berlin Musical Instrument Museum]] or "MIM" collects instruments from the European [[art music]] school from the 16th to the 21st century. It holds about 3,200 instruments, of which 800 can be seen on permanent display. Those that are playable are played regularly. It is one of the most representative collections in Germany in its diversity. The museum also operates a restoration workshop and has its own concert hall with an active program of chamber concerts.

===Division II: Music Theory and Music History===
This department conducts large-scale research projects in the fields of [[Music Theory]] and [[Music History]] from antiquity to the present. It also operates the Institute's library with a special focus on [[organology]] and the [[Second Viennese School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sim.spk-berlin.de/wiener_schule_301.html The conceptual plan to edit the correspondence of the Second Viennese School]&lt;/ref&gt; It also manages the German National contribution to the [[RILM]] Abstract of Music Literature. Bibliographical work of the Institute is currently organized in the form of interactive database 
[[Bibliography of Music Literature|'''BMS ''online''''']].

===Division III: Acoustics and Music technology===
This Department researches [[Recording studio]] technology, services the Institute's Electronic equipment, and manages the full digitization its resources. One major project captures the sounds of the historic musical instruments in the Museum systematically and them develops mathematical models to describe them. Recordings from concerts at the Museum are also part of the tasks of the Department. [[Digital recording]] studio space allows it to create high-quality master CDs in-house.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9432">The '''Tanabe Hisao Prize''' ({{lang-ja|田辺尚雄音楽賞 or 田辺尚雄賞}}) (often known more simply as the "Tanabe Prize") was created in 1983 by the Tōyō Ongaku Gakkai ({{lang-ja|東洋音楽学会}}, "Society for Research in Asiatic Music"), the oldest musicological society of [[Japan]] (headquartered in [[Tokyo]]).  The prize is named after the musicologist [[Tanabe Hisao]] ({{lang-ja|田辺尚雄}},1883–1984), one of the founding members of the society.  The prize is awarded annually to one or several individuals or groups who have published an outstanding work of Asian [[musicology]]  during the previous year, one that "promotes further research in Asian musicology and contributes to Japanese scholarship."  It is generally considered the most prestigious award in the field of Asian musicology awarded in Japan.

{{italic title}}
The '''''German Academy of the Noble Arts of Architecture, Sculpture and Painting''''', or '''''Teutsche Academie''''', refers to a comprehensive dictionary of art by [[Joachim von Sandrart]] published in the late 17th century. The first version was published in 1675 and it included a compilation of artist biographies  that were later accompanied by illustrations by [[Richard Collin]] for a 1683 Latin edition by [[Christianus Rhodius]]. The list of portrait illustrations follows and is in page order. Most of the biographies were translated into German from earlier work by [[Karel van Mander]] and [[Cornelis de Bie]], but Sandrart had travelled extensively in Europe and added many original biographies of German-born artists to his list. The illustrated portraits of artists born before his time were mostly based on 17th-century engravings by [[Hieronymus Cock]] and [[Jan Meyssens]], many of which had also been re-published in De Bie's [[Het Gulden Cabinet]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4864">'''Time-triggered architecture''' (abbreviated as '''TTA'''), also known as a '''time-triggered system''', is a computer system that executes one or more sets of tasks according to a pre-determined and set task schedule.&lt;ref name="PTTES"&gt;Pont, M.J. (2001) "Patterns for Time-Triggered Embedded Systems", Addison-Wesley / ACM Press.  {{ISBN|0-201-331381}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of a TT system will typically involve use of a single interrupt that is linked to the periodic overflow of a timer.  This interrupt may drive a task scheduler (a restricted form of [[real-time operating system]]).  The scheduler will{{mdashb}}in turn{{mdashb}}release the system tasks at predetermined points in time.&lt;ref name="PTTES"/&gt;

== History and development ==

Because they have highly deterministic timing behaviour, TT systems have been used for many years to develop [[safety-critical]] aerospace and related systems.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;Ward, N. J. (1991) "The static analysis of a safety-critical avionics control system", in Corbyn, D.E. and Bray, N. P. (Eds.) "Air Transport Safety: Proceedings of the Safety and Reliability Society Spring Conference, 1991" Published by SaRS, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of TT systems was popularised by the publication of ''Patterns for Time-Triggered Embedded Systems'' (PTTES) in 2001&lt;ref name="PTTES"/&gt; and the related introductory book ''Embedded C'' in 2002.&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;Pont, M.J. (2002) "Embedded C", Addison-Wesley.  {{ISBN|0-201-79523-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The PTTES book also introduced the concepts of time-triggered hybrid schedulers (an architecture for time-triggered systems that require task pre-emption) and shared-clock schedulers (an architecture for distributed time-triggered systems involving multiple, synchronised, nodes).&lt;ref name="PTTES"/&gt;

Since publication of PTTES, extensive research work on TT systems has been carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Athaide, K.F., Pont, M.J. and Ayavoo, D. (2008) "Deploying a time-triggered shared-clock architecture in a multiprocessor system-on-chip design", in Proceedings of the 4th UK Embedded Forum (September 2008, Southampton, UK).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ayavoo, D., Pont, M.J., Short, M. and Parker, S. (2007) "Two novel shared-clock scheduling algorithms for use with CAN-based distributed systems", Microprocessors and Microsystems, 31(5): 326–334.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chan, K.L. and Pont, M.J. (2010) "Real-time non-invasive detection of timing-constraint violations in time-triggered embedded systems", Proceedings of the 7th IEEE International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems, Bradford, UK, 2010, pp.1978–1986. Published by IEEE Computer Society. {{ISBN|978-0-7695-4108-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gendy, A.K. and Pont, M.J. (2008) "Automatically configuring time-triggered schedulers for use with resource-constrained, single-processor embedded systems", IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 4(1): 37–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Z.M. and Pont, M.J. (2008) "Reducing the impact of task overruns in resource-constrained embedded systems in which a time-triggered software architecture is employed", Transactions of the Institute of Measurement and Control, Vol. 30: pp.427–450.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phatrapornnant, T. and Pont, M.J. (2006) "Reducing jitter in embedded systems employing a time-triggered software architecture and dynamic voltage scaling", IEEE Transactions on Computers, 55(2): 113–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current applications ==

Time-triggered systems are now commonly associated with international safety standards such as [[IEC 61508]] (industrial systems), [[ISO 26262]] (automotive systems), [[IEC 62304]] (medical systems) and [[IEC 60730]] (household goods).

== Alternatives ==

Time-triggered systems can be viewed as a subset of a more general event-triggered (ET) system architecture (see [[event-driven programming]]).

Implementation of an ET system will typically involve use of multiple interrupts, each associated with specific periodic events (such as timer overflows) or aperiodic events (such as the arrival of messages over a communication bus at random points in time).  ET designs are traditionally associated with the use of what is known as a [[real-time operating system]] (or RTOS), though use of such a software platform is not a defining characteristic of an ET architecture.&lt;ref name="PTTES"/&gt;

A '''total station''' ('''TS''') or '''total station theodolite''' ('''TST''') is an electronic/optical instrument used for [[surveying]] and [[Construction|building construction]].  It is an electronic  transit [[theodolite]] integrated with [[Rangefinder|electronic distance measurement]] (EDM) to measure both vertical and horizontal angles and the slope distance from the instrument to a particular point, and an on-board computer to collect data and perform [[triangulation (surveying)|triangulation]] calculations.&lt;ref name="KavanaghBird1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kavanagh|first1=Barry F. |last2=Bird|first2=S. J. Glenn |title=Surveying: Principles and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Io8rAQAAMAAJ|edition=4th|year=1996|publisher=Prentice Hall|pp=257-264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robotic]] or motorized total stations allow the operator to control the instrument from a distance via remote control. This eliminates the need for an assistant staff member as the operator holds the [[retroreflector]] and controls the total station from the observed point. These motorized total stations can also be used in automated setups knows as Automated Motorized Total Station (AMTS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Passagen und Passanten, Shopping Malls und Konsumentinnen |url=List of shopping malls in Finland |website=Shopping Malls |publisher=VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften |accessdate=21 November 2018 |pages=55–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

=== Angle measurement ===

Most total station instruments measure angles by means of electro-optical scanning of extremely precise digital bar-codes etched on rotating glass cylinders or discs within the instrument. The best quality total stations are capable of measuring angles to 0.5 [[arc-second]]. Inexpensive "construction grade" total stations can generally measure angles to 5 or 10 arc-seconds.

=== Distance measurement ===
{{main|Distance measurement}}

Measurement of distance is accomplished with a modulated  [[infrared]] carrier signal, generated by a small solid-state emitter within the instrument's optical path, and reflected by a prism reflector or the object under survey. The modulation pattern in the returning signal is read and interpreted by the computer in the total station. The distance is determined by emitting and receiving multiple frequencies, and determining the integer number of [[wavelengths]] to the target for each [[frequency]]. Most total stations use purpose-built glass [[prism (surveying)]] reflectors for the EDM signal. A typical total station can measure distances with an accuracy of about {{convert|1.5|mm|ft|sp=us}} + 2 parts per million over a distance of up to {{convert|1500|m|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leica-geosystems.us/en/Construction-Surveying-TPS-Leica-FlexLine-TS020609_72053.htm ''Leica Flexline TS02/06/09'']. (2008). Leica Geosystems. See datasheet for model TS06 (PDF). Retrieved 27 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflectorless total stations can measure distances to any object that is reasonably light in color, up to a few hundred [[metre|meters]].

=== Coordinate measurement ===

The coordinates of an unknown point relative to a known coordinate can be determined using the total station as long as a direct line of sight can be established between the two points. Angles and distances are measured from the total station to points under survey, and the [[coordinate]]s (X, Y, and Z or easting, northing and [[elevation]]) of surveyed points relative to the total station position are calculated using [[trigonometry]] and [[triangulation]].
To determine an absolute location a Total Station requires line of sight observations and can be set up over a known point or with line of sight to 2 or more points with known location, called [[Resection (Free Stationing)|free stationing]].&lt;ref name = TS11&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leica-geosystems.us/common/shared/downloads/inc/downloader.asp?id=14376 | date = n.d. | title = Leica Viva TS11 Datasheet | publisher = Leica Geosystems - Americas | accessdate = June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Free Stationing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Purpose, Advantage, and Objective of Resection Setup|url=http://trl.trimble.com/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-406432/SC_Purpose,%20advantage%20and%20objective%20of%20resection%20setup.htm|website=Trimble Knowledge Center|publisher=Trimble|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason, some total stations also have a [[GNSS|Global Navigation Satellite System]] receiver and do not require a direct line of sight to determine coordinates. However, GNSS measurements may require longer occupation periods and offer relatively poor accuracy in the vertical axis.&lt;ref name = TS11/&gt;

=== Data processing ===

Some models include internal electronic data storage to record distance, horizontal angle, and vertical angle measured, while other models are equipped to write these measurements to an external [[data logger|data collector]], such as a hand-held computer.

When data is downloaded from a total station onto a computer, application software can be used to compute results and generate a [[map]] of the surveyed area. The newest generation of total stations can also show the map on the touch-screen of the instrument immediately after measuring the points.

== Applications ==

Total stations are mainly used by [[land surveyor]]s and [[civil engineers]], either to record features as in topographic surveying or to set out features (such as roads, houses or boundaries). They are also used by archaeologists to record excavations and by police, crime scene investigators, private accident reconstructionists and insurance companies to take measurements of scenes.  

=== Mining ===
Total stations are the primary survey instrument used in [[mining]] surveying.

A total station is used to record the absolute location of the tunnel walls, ceilings (backs), and floors as the [[drift (mining)|drifts]] of an underground mine are driven. The recorded data are then downloaded into a [[CAD program]], and compared to the designed layout of the tunnel.

The survey party installs control stations at regular intervals. These are small steel plugs installed in pairs in holes drilled into walls or the back. For wall stations, two plugs are installed in opposite walls, forming a line perpendicular to the drift. For back stations, two plugs are installed in the back, forming a line parallel to the drift.

A set of plugs can be used to locate the total station set up in a drift or tunnel by processing measurements to the plugs by intersection and [[Resection (orientation)|resection]].

=== Mechanical and electrical construction ===
Total stations have become the highest standard for most forms of construction layout.{{According to whom|date=December 2016}}

They are most often used in the X and Y axis to lay out the locations of penetrations out of the underground utilities into the foundation, between floors of a structure, as well as roofing penetrations.

Because more commercial and industrial construction jobs have become centered around [[building information modeling]] (BIM), the coordinates for almost every pipe, conduit, duct and hanger support are available with digital precision.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=December 2016}} The application of communicating a virtual model to a tangible construction potentially eliminates labor costs related to moving poorly measured systems, as well as time spent laying out these systems in the midst of a full blown construction job in progress.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Meteorology===
[[Meteorologists]] also use total stations to track [[weather balloon]]s for determining upper-level winds.  With the average ascent rate of the weather balloon known or assumed, the change in azimuth and elevation readings provided by the total station as it tracks the weather balloon over time are used to compute the wind speed and direction at different altitudes.  Additionally, the total station is used to track ceiling balloons to determine the height of cloud layers.  Such upper-level wind data is often used for aviation weather forecasting and rocket launches.

The '''Wrocław University of [[Economics]]''' ''(Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny we Wrocławiu)'' is one of ten public [[university|universities]] located in [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]]. Originally established in 1947 as a private business school (then named ''Wyższa Szkoła Handlowa'', or "Trade College"), it was nationalized in 1954 under the name ''Wyższa Szkoła Ekonomiczna'', "College of Economics"). In October 1974 it was named  after the Polish economist [[Oskar Lange]], although his name does not occur in the official English name of the university. Changing the name to the Wrocław University of Economics ''(Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny we Wrocławiu)'' in 2008 removed [[Oskar Lange]] from the name of the University.

The main campus with three out of four departments is located on Ulica Komandorska near the center of Wrocław, whereas one faculty (Regional Economy and Tourism) resides in a separate campus in [[Jelenia Góra]].

The university comprises the following schools (faculties):
*School of Economic Sciences
*School of Engineering and Economics
*School of Management, Computer Science and Finance
*School of Regional Economy and Tourism (Jelenia Góra)

Altogether it employs 784 academic teachers including 142 professors. There is strong interest in economic studies, in the current academic year  the University has about 17,000 students, and so far it has produced over 70,000 graduates.
