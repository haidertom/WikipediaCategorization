[[File:Circus-Parade white-bandwagon Jul09.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A literal "bandwagon", from which the metaphor is derived.]]
The '''bandwagon effect''' is a phenomenon whereby the rate of uptake of beliefs, ideas, [[fads and trends]] increases the more that they have already been adopted by others. In other words, the bandwagon effect is characterized by the probability of individual adoption increasing with respect to the proportion who have already done so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Colman |title=Oxford Dictionary of Psychology |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |page=77 |isbn=0-19-280632-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As more people come to believe in something, others also "hop on the bandwagon" regardless of the underlying evidence.

The tendency to follow the actions or beliefs of others can occur because individuals directly prefer to conform, or because individuals derive information from others. Both explanations have been used for evidence of [[conformity]] in psychological experiments. For example, social pressure has been used to explain [[Asch conformity experiments|Asch's conformity experiments]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Asch |first=S. E. |year=1955 |title=Opinions and social pressure |journal=Scientific American |volume=193 |pages=31–35 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1155-31 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and information has been used to explain [[Muzafer Sherif#Autokinetic effect experiments|Sherif's autokinetic experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sherif |first=M. |year=1936 |title=The psychology of social norms |location=New York |publisher=Harper Collins }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this concept, the increasing popularity of a product or phenomenon encourages more people to "get on the bandwagon", too. The bandwagon effect explains why there are fashion trends.&lt;ref name="LongFox2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D. Stephen Long|author2=Nancy Ruth Fox|title=Calculated Futures: Theology, Ethics, and Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82SruCvd69UC&amp;pg=PT62|accessdate=30 August 2013|year=2007|publisher=Baylor University Press|isbn=978-1-60258-014-5|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When individuals make [[rationality|rational]] choices based on the information they receive from others, economists have proposed that [[information cascades]] can quickly form in which people decide to ignore their personal information signals and follow the behavior of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bikhchandani |first=Sushil |last2=Hirshleifer |first2=David |last3=Welch |first3=Ivo |year=1992 |title=A Theory of Fads, Fashion, Custom, and Cultural Change as Informational Cascades |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=100 |issue=5 |pages=992–1026 |doi= 10.1086/261849|jstor=2138632 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cascades explain why behavior is fragile—people understand that they are based on very limited information. As a result, fads form easily but are also easily dislodged. Such informational effects have been used to explain political bandwagons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lohmann |first=S. |year=1994 |title=The Dynamics of Informational Cascades: The Monday Demonstrations in Leipzig, East Germany, 1989-91 |journal=World Politics |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=42–101 |jstor=2950679 |doi=10.2307/2950679 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The definition of a bandwagon is a wagon which carries a band during the course of a parade, circus or other entertainment event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bandwagon |publisher=Dictionary.com |title= Bandwagon |accessdate=2007-03-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070312031504/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bandwagon| archivedate= 12 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "jump on the bandwagon" first appeared in American politics in 1848 when [[Dan Rice]], a famous and popular circus clown of the time, used his bandwagon and its music to gain attention for his political campaign appearances. As his campaign became more successful, other politicians strove for a seat on the bandwagon, hoping to be associated with his success. Later, during the time of [[William Jennings Bryan]]'s 1900 presidential campaign, bandwagons had become standard in campaigns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wordwizard.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=6642 |title=Bandwagon Effect |accessdate=2007-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the phrase "jump on the bandwagon" was used as a derogatory term, implying that people were associating themselves with success without considering that with which they associated themselves.

The bandwagon effect occurs in voting:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nadeau |first=Richard |first2=Edouard |last2=Cloutier |first3=J.-H. |last3=Guay |title=New Evidence About the Existence of a Bandwagon Effect in the Opinion Formation Process |journal=International Political Science Review |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=203–213 |year=1993 |doi=10.1177/019251219301400204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; some people vote for those candidates or parties who are likely to succeed (or are proclaimed as such by the media), hoping to be on the "winner's side" in the end.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The bandwagon effect has been applied to situations involving majority opinion, such as political outcomes, where people alter their opinions to the majority view.{{sfn|McAllister| Studlar|1991}} Such a shift in opinion can occur because individuals draw inferences from the decisions of others, as in an [[informational cascade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dumaguetemetropost.com/beware-of-the-bandwagon-effect-other-cognitive-biases-p7272-99.htm|title=Beware of the bandwagon effect, other cognitive biases|website=dumaguetemetropost.com|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Because of time zones, election results are broadcast in the eastern parts of the United States while polls are still open in the west. This difference has led to research on how the behavior of voters in western United States is influenced by news about the decisions of voters in other time zones. In 1980, [[NBC News]] declared [[Ronald Reagan]] to be the winner of the presidential race on the basis of the exit polls several hours before the voting booths closed in the west.

It is also said to be important in the American presidential primary elections. States all vote at different times, spread over some months, rather than all on one day. Some states (Iowa, New Hampshire) have special precedence to go early while others choose to wait until a certain date. This is often said to give undue influence to these states, a win in these early states is said to give a candidate the "[[The Big Mo|Big Mo]]" (momentum) and has propelled many candidates to win the nomination. Because of this, other states often try front loading (going as early as possible) to make their say as influential as they can. In the 2008 presidential primaries two states had all or some of their delegates banned from the convention by the central party organizations for voting too early.&lt;ref&gt;(2007, October 22). 5 States May Use Half Of GOP [Supplemental Material]. ''USA Today''. Retrieved from https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2007-10-22-gop-delegates_N.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,294601,00.html |title=Florida Democrats Stripped of Convention Delegates Due to Early Primary |work=FOX News |date=2007-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies have tested this theory of the bandwagon effect in political decision making. In the [[#CITEREFGoidelShields1994|1994 study]] of Robert K. Goidel and Todd G. Shields in ''[[The Journal of Politics]]'', 180 students at the University of Kentucky were randomly assigned to nine groups and were asked questions about the same set of election scenarios. About 70% of subjects received information about the expected winner.{{sfn|Goidel|Shields|1994|p=807}} Independents, which are those who do not vote based on the endorsement of any party and are ultimately neutral, were influenced strongly in favor of the person expected to win.{{sfn|Goidel|Shields|1994|pp=807-808}} Expectations played a significant role throughout the study. It was found that independents are twice as likely to vote for the Republican candidate when the Republican is expected to win. From the results, it was also found that when the Democrat was expected to win, independent Republicans and weak Republicans were more likely to vote for the Democratic candidate.{{sfn|Goidel|Shields|1994|p=808}}

A study by Albert Mehrabian, reported in the ''[[Journal of Applied Social Psychology]]'' ([[#CITEREFMehrabian1998|1998]]), tested the relative importance of the bandwagon (rally around the winner) effect versus the [[underdog (competition)|underdog]] (empathic support for those trailing) effect. Bogus poll results presented to voters prior to the 1996 Republican primary clearly showed the bandwagon effect to predominate on balance. Indeed, approximately 6% of the variance in the vote was explained in terms of the bogus polls, showing that poll results (whether accurate or inaccurate) can significantly influence election results in closely contested elections. In particular, assuming that one candidate "is an initial favorite by a slim margin, reports of polls showing that candidate as the leader in the race will increase his or her favorable margin".{{sfn|Mehrabian|1998|p=2128}} Thus, as poll results are repeatedly reported, the bandwagon effect will tend to snowball and become a powerful aid to leading candidates.

During the 1992 U.S. presidential election, Vicki G. Morwitz and Carol Pluzinski conducted a study, which was published in ''The Journal of Consumer Research'' ([[#CITEREFMorwitzPluzinski1996|1996]]). At a large northeastern university, some of 214 volunteer business students were given the results of student and national polls indicating that [[Bill Clinton]] was in the lead. Others were not exposed to the results of the polls. Several students who had intended to vote for Bush changed their minds after seeing the poll results.{{sfn|Morwitz|Pluzinski|1996|pp=58-64}}

Additionally, British polls have shown an increase to public exposure. Sixty-eight percent of voters had heard of the general election campaign results of the opinion poll in 1979. In 1987, this number of voters aware of the results increased to 74%.{{sfn|McAllister| Studlar|1991| p=725}} According to British studies, there is a consistent pattern of apparent bandwagon effects for the leading party.

In a study published in the ''[[European Economic Review]]'' (2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morton|first=Rebecca|first2=Mueller|last2=Daniel|first3=Page |last3=Lionel|first4=Torgler|last4=Benno|title=Exit polls, turnout, and bandwagon voting: Evidence from a natural experiment |journal=European Economic Review |volume=77 |pages=65–81 |year=2015 |doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2015.03.012|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292115000483}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morton and co-authors, used the large number of time zones across French overseas territories, to study the bandwagon effect. Before 2002, all territories were voting on Sunday in the presidential elections. For that reason, voters in territories located to the West of mainland France (e.g. French Guyana) could observe the exit polls from mainland France before the close of their local polling booths. After 2002, a law was passed for these territories to vote on Saturday, in order to avoid this situation. The authors observed a bandwagon effect: when voters from Western territories could observe the winner in mainland France, this candidate was doing much better locally. After 2002, when voting in these territories took place before mainland France, this bandwagon voting disappeared.

==In microeconomics==
{{See also|Network effect|Veblen good}}
In [[microeconomics]], bandwagon effects may play out in interactions of demand and preference.&lt;ref name="harvey"&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink= Harvey Leibenstein |first= Harvey |last= Leibenstein |title= Bandwagon, Snob, and Veblen Effects in the Theory of Consumers' Demand |journal= [[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |year= 1950 |volume= 64 |issue= 2 |pages= 183–207 |doi= 10.2307/1882692 |jstor= 1882692 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=June 2018}} The bandwagon effect arises when people's preference for a commodity increases as the number of people buying it increases. This interaction potentially disturbs the normal results of the theory of [[supply and demand]], which assumes that consumers make buying decisions solely based on price and their own personal preference.

Gary Becker has argued that bandwagon effects could be so strong as to make the [[demand curve]] slope upward.&lt;ref&gt;

 | quote = In Gary Becker's (1991) theory of bandwagon effects, a portion of market demand is positively sloped. In this, he ignores Harvey Leibenstein's (1950) hypothesis that market demands for bandwagon goods are everywhere negatively sloped (stemming from scarcity imposed constraints). A substantial literature now invokes Becker's bandwagon, also ignoring Leibenstein.

== In medicine ==
Medical bandwagons have been identified as “the overwhelming acceptance of unproved but popular ideas”. They have led to inappropriate therapies for numerous numbers of patients, and have impeded the development of more appropriate treatment.

In Lawrence Cohen and Henry Rothschild's exposition ''The Bandwagons of Medicine'' (1979) several of these therapeutic misadventures, some of which persisted for centuries before they were abandoned, substituted by another bandwagon, or replaced by a scientifically valid alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=L|last2=Rothschild|first2=H|title=The bandwagons of medicine|journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|date=1979|volume=22|issue=4|pages=531–8|pmid=226929|doi=10.1353/pbm.1979.0037}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient serpent cult of Aesculapius, in which sacred snakes licked the afflicted as treatment of their diseases, is an example of a bandwagon gathering momentum based on a strong personality, in this case a Roman god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1091-255X(02)00054-9|pmid=12504215|title=The Bandwagon Effect|journal=Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery|volume=6|issue=6|pages=787–794|year=2002|last1=Rikkers|first1=L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One who supports a particular sports team, despite having shown no interest in that team until it started gaining success, can be considered a "bandwagon fan". One recent example in the United States is the [[Golden State Warriors]], who rose to prominence by winning the [[2015 NBA Finals]], followed by a record-breaking 73-9 record [[2015-16 NBA season|the following year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/standings|title=NBA Preseason Season Conference Standings - National Basketball Association|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, sales of point guard [[Stephen Curry]]'s jersey skyrocketed. Curry merchandise sales in the first two weeks of the [[2015–16 NBA season|2015–2016 season]] were 453% higher than in the first two weeks of the [[2014–15 NBA season|2014–2015 season]], including a 581% increase in sales of his jersey; his merchandise was a top-seller in 38 of the 50 U.S. states, and the Warriors' merchandise became the best-selling of any NBA team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2015/11/11/steph-curry-jersey-sales-up-nearly-600-over-last-year/#3e1bc08b15db|title=Steph Curry Jersey Sales Up Nearly 600% Over Last Year|last=Badenhausen|first=Kurt|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bench Around the Lake''''' is a public artwork by [[Danes|Danish]] artist [[Jeppe Hein]], located in the [[100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park]], in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name="100Acres"&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |title=100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art &amp; Nature Park |publisher= [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] |year= 2011 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artwork consists of fifteen individually designed yellow [[Interactive art|interactive]] [[Bench (furniture)|bench]] installations strategically placed throughout the park location. Some of the benches consist of multiple components or sections within one site.

==Description==
The artwork consists of fifteen bright [[yellow]] benches of different shapes, sizes and designs made of [[powder coated]] [[galvanized steel]]. The benches are placed at specific sites, as decided by the artist, throughout the park which borders the bank of the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]]. Hein describes the work as "one long bench that emerges from the ground and then twists, turns, and submerges again in several locations,".&lt;ref name="100Acres"/&gt;

==Historical Information==

''Bench Around the Lake'' is a re-interpretation of Hein's ''[[Modified Social Benches]]'' which manipulate the traditional concept of a park bench. With this artwork series Hein hopes to challenge the idea of a bench being a passive object used for sitting, as well as to promote visitors to interact with the artwork in different ways and to explore more secluded or less-used areas of the park.&lt;ref name="100Acres"/&gt; This series of benches also coincided with Hein's May 2010 temporary installation of ''[[Distance (sculpture)|Distance]]'' inside the museum.&lt;ref name="ArtDailyorg"&gt;{{cite web | author=Sarah Green | year=2010 | title=Exhibition of Interactive Work by Artist Jeppe Hein Announced in Indianapolis  | work= | publisher=Art Daily | url=http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=2&amp;int_new=35739&amp;int_modo=1 | accessdate= 10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location History===

Working with IMA staff and Indianapolis-based [[landscape architect]] Eric Fulford, Hein selected the locations for the benches which are placed throughout the 35-acre park. The benches appear along the [[beach]]es on the [[lake]] and [[river]], a [[gully]], by fallen [[tree]]s, the park's [[Ruth Lilly Visitors Pavilion]] and other spots throughout the park's many pathways.&lt;ref name="100Acres"/&gt; The artwork was fabricated in Germany and shipped to Indianapolis and installed at the IMA by their Design and Installation crew.  The artwork was fully installed by the park's opening in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheets.|first=Hilarie M.|title=100 Acres to Roam, No Restrictions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/arts/design/13park.html|accessdate=2011-08-28|date=June 29, 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On creating the artwork Hein states: "Once you start to experience them sequentially, you'll feel that connection between them," encouraging interaction with the artworks by visitors and the appearance of tunneling the benches have within the environment. "They are a tool for communication, and create a kind of social playroom," Hein states, referring to the functional aspects of each bench. He describes one bench as the "kissing bench" due to the sliding factor the bench has, bringing together those who sit upon it regardless of their desire to be close.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news | author=Hilarie Sheets | year=2010 | title=100 Acres to Roam, No Restrictions  | work=Art &amp; Design  | publisher=The New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/arts/design/13park.html?fta=y&amp;pagewanted=all | accessdate= 4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3800">In [[computational complexity theory]] the '''Blum axioms''' or '''Blum complexity axioms''' are [[axioms]]  that specify desirable properties of complexity measures on the set of [[computable function]]s. The axioms were first defined by [[Manuel Blum]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Blum | first = Manuel | authorlink = Manuel Blum| title = A Machine-Independent Theory of the Complexity of Recursive Functions | doi = 10.1145/321386.321395 | journal = [[Journal of the ACM]]| volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 322–336| year = 1967 | url = http://port70.net/~nsz/articles/classic/blum_complexity_1976.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, [[Blum's speedup theorem]] and the [[Gap theorem]] hold for any complexity measure satisfying these axioms. The most well-known measures satisfying these axioms are those of time (i.e., running time) and space (i.e., memory usage).

== Definitions ==

A '''Blum complexity measure''' is a pair &lt;math&gt;(\varphi, \Phi)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; a [[Gödel numbering]] of the [[partial computable function]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; and a computable function
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbf{P}^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt;
which satisfies the following '''Blum axioms'''. We write &lt;math&gt;\varphi_i&lt;/math&gt; for the ''i''-th [[partial computable function]] under the Gödel numbering &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Phi_i&lt;/math&gt; for the partial computable function &lt;math&gt;\Phi(i)&lt;/math&gt;.
* the [[domain (mathematics)|domains]] of &lt;math&gt;\varphi_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Phi_i&lt;/math&gt; are identical.
* the set &lt;math&gt;\{(i,x,t) \in \mathbb{N}^3 | \Phi_i(x) = t\}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Recursive_language|recursive]].

=== Examples ===

*  &lt;math&gt;(\varphi, \Phi)&lt;/math&gt; is a complexity measure, if &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is either the time or the memory (or some suitable combination thereof) required for the computation coded by ''i''.
*  &lt;math&gt;(\varphi, \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; is ''not'' a complexity measure, since it fails the second axiom.

=== Notes ===

A Blum complexity measure is defined using computable functions without any reference to a specific [[model of computation]]. In order to make the definition more accessible we rephrase the Blum axioms in terms of [[Turing machine]]s: 

A ''Blum complexity measure'' is a function &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; from pairs (Turing machine &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, input &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;) to the natural numbers union infinity. Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; should satisfy the following axioms:

* &lt;math&gt;\Phi(M,x)&lt;/math&gt; is finite if and only if &lt;math&gt;M(x)&lt;/math&gt; [[halting problem|halts]]
* There is an algorithm which, on input &lt;math&gt;(M,x,n)&lt;/math&gt; decides if &lt;math&gt;\Phi(M,x)=n&lt;/math&gt;

For example, suppose &lt;math&gt;\Phi(M,x)&lt;/math&gt; gives the number of time steps that the machine ''M'' runs for on input ''x'' before halting. The first axiom is clear; the second follows because a [[universal Turing machine]] can simulate ''M'' on ''x'' while counting its steps. If ''M'' exceeds ''n'' steps, it can halt and reject, so there is no need to determine if ''M'' halts on ''x''.

== Complexity classes ==

For a [[total computable function]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; [[complexity class]]es of computable functions can be defined as
:&lt;math&gt;C(f) := \{ \varphi_i \in \mathbf{P}^{(1)} | \forall x.\ \Phi_i(x) \leq f(x) \}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C^0(f) := \{ h \in C(f) | \mathrm{codom}(h) \subseteq \{0,1\} \}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C(f)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all computable functions with a complexity less than &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;C^0(f)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all [[boolean-valued function]]s with a complexity less than &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. If we consider those functions as [[indicator function]]s on sets, &lt;math&gt;C^0(f)&lt;/math&gt; can be thought of as a complexity class of sets.

In [[abstract algebra]], a '''Boolean algebra''' or '''Boolean lattice''' is a [[complemented lattice|complemented]] [[distributive lattice]]. This type of [[algebraic structure]] captures essential properties of both [[Set (mathematics)|set]] operations and [[logic]] operations. A Boolean algebra can be seen as a generalization of a [[power set]] algebra or a [[field of sets]], or its elements can be viewed as generalized [[truth value]]s. It is also a special case of a [[De Morgan algebra]] and a [[Kleene algebra (with involution)]].

Every Boolean algebra [[Boolean algebra (structure)#Boolean rings|gives rise]] to a [[Boolean ring]], and vice versa, with ring multiplication corresponding to [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] or [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] ∧, and ring addition to [[exclusive or|exclusive disjunction]] or [[symmetric difference]] (not [[logical disjunction|disjunction]] ∨). However, the theory of Boolean rings has an inherent asymmetry between the two operators, while the axioms and theorems of Boolean algebra express the symmetry of the theory described by the [[Duality principle (Boolean algebra)|duality principle]].&lt;ref&gt;Givant and [[Paul Halmos]], 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;20&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==  &lt;!-- [[Boolean algebra (history)]] redirects here --&gt;

The term "Boolean algebra" honors [[George Boole]] (1815–1864), a self-educated English mathematician. He introduced the [[algebraic system]] initially in a small pamphlet, ''The Mathematical Analysis of Logic'', published in 1847 in response to an ongoing public controversy between [[Augustus De Morgan]] and [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]], and later as a more substantial book, ''[[The Laws of Thought]]'', published in 1854. Boole's formulation differs from that described above in some important respects. For example, conjunction and disjunction in Boole were not a dual pair of operations. Boolean algebra emerged in the 1860s, in papers written by [[William Jevons]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. The first systematic presentation of Boolean algebra and [[distributive lattice]]s is owed to the 1890 ''Vorlesungen'' of [[Ernst Schröder]]. The first extensive treatment of Boolean algebra in English is [[A. N. Whitehead]]'s 1898 ''Universal Algebra''. Boolean algebra as an axiomatic algebraic structure in the modern axiomatic sense begins with a 1904 paper by [[Edward V. Huntington]]. Boolean algebra came of age as serious mathematics with the work of [[Marshall Stone]] in the 1930s, and with [[Garrett Birkhoff]]'s 1940 ''Lattice Theory''. In the 1960s, [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]], [[Dana Scott]], and others found deep new results in [[mathematical logic]] and [[axiomatic set theory]] using offshoots of Boolean algebra, namely [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] and [[Boolean-valued model]]s.

== Definition ==

A '''Boolean algebra''' is a six-[[tuple]] consisting of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'', equipped with two [[binary operation]]s ∧ (called "meet" or "and"), ∨ (called "join" or "or"), a [[unary operation]] ¬ (called "complement" or "not") and two elements 0 and 1 (called "bottom" and "top", or "least" and "greatest" element, also denoted by the symbols ⊥ and ⊤, respectively), such that for all elements ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' of ''A'', the following [[axiom]]s hold:&lt;ref&gt;Davey, Priestley, 1990, p.109, 131, 144&lt;/ref&gt;

::{| cellpadding=5
|''a'' ∨ (''b'' ∨ ''c'') = (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∨ ''c''
|''a'' ∧ (''b'' ∧ ''c'') = (''a'' ∧ ''b'') ∧ ''c''
| [[associativity]]
|-
|''a'' ∨ ''b'' = ''b'' ∨ ''a''
|''a'' ∧ ''b'' = ''b'' ∧ ''a''
| [[commutativity]]
|-
|''a'' ∨ (''a'' ∧ ''b'') = ''a''
|''a'' ∧ (''a'' ∨ ''b'') = ''a''
| [[Absorption law|absorption]]
|-
|''a'' ∨ 0 = ''a''
|''a'' ∧ 1 = ''a''
| [[identity element|identity]]
|-
|''a'' ∨ (''b'' ∧ ''c'') = (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∧ (''a'' ∨ ''c'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|''a'' ∧ (''b'' ∨ ''c'') = (''a'' ∧ ''b'') ∨ (''a'' ∧ ''c'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| [[distributivity]]
|-
|''a'' ∨ ¬''a'' = 1
|''a'' ∧ ¬''a'' = 0
| [[complemented lattice|complements]]
|}
Note, however, that the absorption law and even the associativity law can be excluded from the set of axioms as they can be derived from the other axioms (see [[Boolean algebra (structure)#Axiomatics|Proven properties]]).

A Boolean algebra with only one element is called a '''trivial Boolean algebra''' or a '''degenerate Boolean algebra'''. (Some authors require 0 and 1 to be ''distinct'' elements in order to exclude this case.)

It follows from the last three pairs of axioms above (identity, distributivity and complements), or from the absorption axiom, that
::''a'' = ''b'' ∧ ''a'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if and only if &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''a'' ∨ ''b'' = ''b''.
The relation ≤ defined by ''a'' ≤ ''b'' if these equivalent conditions hold, is a [[partial order]] with least element 0 and greatest element 1. The meet ''a'' ∧ ''b'' and the join ''a'' ∨ ''b'' of two elements coincide with their [[infimum]] and [[supremum]], respectively, with respect to ≤.

The first four pairs of axioms constitute a definition of a [[bounded lattice]].

It follows from the first five pairs of axioms that any complement is unique.

The set of axioms is [[duality (order theory)|self-dual]] in the sense that if one exchanges ∨ with ∧ and 0 with 1 in an axiom, the result is again an axiom. Therefore, by applying this operation to a Boolean algebra (or Boolean lattice), one obtains another Boolean algebra with the same elements; it is called its '''dual'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Boolean Algebra|first=R. L.|last=Goodstein|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2012|isbn=9780486154978|chapter=Chapter 2: The self-dual system of axioms|pages=21ff|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0fxW2KiyxWwC&amp;pg=PA21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

* The simplest non-trivial Boolean algebra, the [[two-element Boolean algebra]], has only two elements, 0 and 1, and is defined by the rules:

|
{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"

:* It has applications in [[logic]], interpreting 0 as ''false'', 1 as ''true'', ∧ as ''and'', ∨ as ''or'', and ¬ as ''not''. Expressions involving variables and the Boolean operations represent statement forms, and two such expressions can be shown to be equal using the above axioms if and only if the corresponding statement forms are [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]].

:* The two-element Boolean algebra is also used for circuit design in [[electrical engineering]]&lt;ref&gt;Strictly, electrical engineers tend to use additional states to represent other circuit conditions such as high impedance - see [[IEEE 1164]] or [[IEEE 1364]].&lt;/ref&gt;; here 0 and 1 represent the two different states of one [[bit]] in a [[digital circuit]], typically high and low [[voltage]]. Circuits are described by expressions containing variables, and two such expressions are equal for all values of the variables if and only if the corresponding circuits have the same input-output behavior. Furthermore, every possible input-output behavior can be modeled by a suitable Boolean expression.

:* The two-element Boolean algebra is also important in the general theory of Boolean algebras, because an equation involving several variables is generally true in all Boolean algebras if and only if it is true in the two-element Boolean algebra (which can be checked by a trivial [[brute force search|brute force]] algorithm for small numbers of variables). This can for example be used to show that the following laws (''Consensus theorems'') are generally valid in all Boolean algebras:
:** (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∧ (¬''a'' ∨ ''c'') ∧ (''b'' ∨ ''c'') ≡ (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∧ (¬''a'' ∨ ''c'')
:** (''a'' ∧ ''b'') ∨ (¬''a'' ∧ ''c'') ∨ (''b'' ∧ ''c'') ≡ (''a'' ∧ ''b'') ∨ (¬''a'' ∧ ''c'')

* The [[power set]] (set of all subsets) of any given nonempty set ''S'' forms a Boolean algebra, an [[algebra of sets]], with the two operations ∨ := ∪ (union) and ∧ := ∩ (intersection). The smallest element 0 is the [[empty set]] and the largest element 1 is the set ''S'' itself.

:* After the two-element Boolean algebra, the simplest Boolean algebra is that defined by the [[power set]] of two atoms:

| 1 || b || a || 0
|}
|}

* The set of all subsets of ''S'' that are either finite or [[cofinite]] is a Boolean algebra, an [[algebra of sets]].
* Starting with the [[propositional calculus]] with κ sentence symbols, form the [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra|Lindenbaum algebra]] (that is, the set of sentences in the propositional calculus modulo [[logical equivalence]]).  This construction yields a Boolean algebra.  It is in fact the [[free Boolean algebra]] on κ generators.  A truth assignment in propositional calculus is then a Boolean algebra homomorphism from this algebra to the two-element Boolean algebra.
* Given any [[linearly ordered]] set ''L'' with a least element, the interval algebra is the smallest algebra of subsets of ''L'' containing all of the half-open intervals [''a'', ''b'') such that ''a'' is in ''L'' and ''b'' is either in ''L'' or equal to ∞.  Interval algebras are useful in the study of [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra]]s; every countable Boolean algebra is isomorphic to an interval algebra.

[[File:Lattice T 30.svg|thumb|x150px|[[Hasse diagram]] of the Boolean algebra of divisors of 30.]]
* For any [[natural number]] ''n'', the set of all positive [[divisor]]s of ''n'', defining ''a''≤''b'' if ''a'' [[divides]] ''b'', forms a [[distributive lattice]]. This lattice is a Boolean algebra if and only if ''n'' is [[square-free integer|square-free]]. The bottom and the top element of this Boolean algebra is the natural number 1 and ''n'', respectively. The complement of ''a'' is given by ''n''/''a''. The meet and the join of ''a'' and ''b'' is given by the [[greatest common divisor]] (gcd) and the [[least common multiple]] (lcm) of ''a'' and ''b'', respectively. The ring addition ''a''+''b'' is given by lcm(''a'',''b'')/gcd(''a'',''b''). The picture shows an example for ''n'' = 30. As a counter-example, considering the non-square-free ''n''=60, the greatest common divisor of 30 and its complement 2 would be 2, while it should be the bottom element 1.
* Other examples of Boolean algebras arise from [[topology|topological spaces]]: if ''X'' is a topological space, then the collection of all subsets of ''X'' which are [[Clopen set|both open and closed]] forms a Boolean algebra with the operations ∨ := ∪ (union) and ∧ := ∩ (intersection).
* If ''R'' is an arbitrary [[mathematical ring|ring]] and we define the set of ''central idempotents'' by &lt;br&gt; ''A'' = { ''e'' ∈ ''R'' : ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e'', ''ex'' = ''xe'', ∀''x'' ∈ ''R'' } &lt;br&gt; then the set ''A'' becomes a Boolean algebra with the operations ''e'' ∨ ''f'' := ''e'' + ''f'' - ''ef'' and ''e'' ∧ ''f'' := ''ef''.

== Homomorphisms and isomorphisms ==
&lt;!-- "Boolean homomorphism" redirects here --&gt;

A ''[[homomorphism]]'' between two Boolean algebras ''A'' and ''B'' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B'' such that for all ''a'', ''b'' in ''A'':

: ''f''(''a'' ∨ ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') ∨ ''f''(''b''),
: ''f''(''a'' ∧ ''b'') = ''f''(''a'') ∧ ''f''(''b''),
: ''f''(0) = 0,
: ''f''(1) = 1.

It then follows that ''f''(¬''a'') = ¬''f''(''a'') for all ''a'' in ''A''. The [[class (set theory)|class]] of all Boolean algebras, together with this notion of morphism, forms a [[full subcategory]] of the [[category theory|category]] of lattices.
&lt;!--The constant function with ''f''(''a'') = 1 for all ''a'' in ''A'' satisfies the first, second, and fourth conditions but not the third (unless ''B'' is the degenerate singleton Boolean algebra with 0 = 1), so it is not a Boolean algebra homomorphism.--&gt;

An ''isomorphism'' between two Boolean algebras ''A'' and ''B'' is a homomorphism ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B'' with an inverse homomorphism, that is, a homomorphism ''g'' : ''B'' → ''A'' such that the [[function composition|composition]] ''g'' ◌ ''f'': ''A'' → ''A'' is the [[identity function]] on ''A'', and the composition ''f'' ◌ ''g'': ''B'' → ''B'' is the identity function on ''B''.  A homomorphism of Boolean algebras is an isomorphism if and only if it is [[bijection|bijective]].

== Boolean rings ==
{{Main article|Boolean ring}}
Every Boolean algebra (A, ∧, ∨) gives rise to a [[ring (algebra)|ring]] (''A'', +, ·) by defining ''a'' + ''b'' := (''a'' ∧ ¬''b'') ∨ (''b'' ∧ ¬''a'') = (''a'' ∨ ''b'') ∧ ¬(''a'' ∧ ''b'') (this operation is called [[symmetric difference]] in the case of sets and [[Truth table#Exclusive disjunction|XOR]] in the case of logic) and ''a'' · ''b'' := ''a'' ∧ ''b''. The zero element of this ring coincides with the 0 of the Boolean algebra; the multiplicative identity element of the ring is the 1 of the Boolean algebra. This ring has the property that ''a'' · ''a'' = ''a'' for all ''a'' in ''A''; rings with this property are called [[Boolean ring]]s.

Conversely, if a Boolean ring ''A'' is given, we can turn it into a Boolean algebra by defining ''x'' ∨ ''y'' := ''x'' + ''y'' + (''x'' · ''y'') and ''x'' ∧ ''y'' := ''x'' · ''y''.
&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hsiang, 1985, p.260&lt;/ref&gt;
Since these two constructions are inverses of each other, we can say that every Boolean ring arises from a Boolean algebra, and vice versa. Furthermore, a map ''f'' : ''A'' → ''B'' is a homomorphism of Boolean algebras if and only if it is a homomorphism of Boolean rings. The [[category theory|categories]] of Boolean rings and Boolean algebras are equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cohn|2003}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VESm0MJOiDQC&amp;pg=PA81 p.&amp;nbsp;81].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hsiang (1985) gave a [[Abstract rewriting system|rule-based algorithm]] to [[Word problem (mathematics)|check]] whether two arbitrary expressions denote the same value in every Boolean ring.
&lt;!---probably too much details(?):---
Hsiang (1985) gave a [[Confluence (abstract rewriting)|confluent]] and [[Abstract_rewriting_system#Termination_and_convergence|terminating]] [[Abstract rewriting system|rewrite system]] for Boolean rings, thus solving their [[Word problem (mathematics)|word problem]]: to check whether two arbitrary expressions ''s'' and ''t'' denote the same value in every Boolean ring, apply rewrite rules to ''s'' as long as possible, resulting in an expression ''s''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, obtain ''t''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; from ''t'' in a similar way, and check whether ''s''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are literally identical, except for different parenthezation and order of operands of "+" or "·".
---&gt;
More generally, Boudet, [[Jean-Pierre Jouannaud|Jouannaud]], and Schmidt-Schauß (1989) gave an algorithm to [[Unification (computer science)#Particular background knowledge sets E|solve equations]] between arbitrary Boolean-ring expressions.
Employing the similarity of Boolean rings and Boolean algebras, both algorithms have applications in [[automated theorem proving]].

An ''ideal'' of the Boolean algebra ''A'' is a subset ''I'' such that for all ''x'', ''y'' in ''I'' we have ''x'' ∨ ''y'' in ''I'' and for all ''a'' in ''A'' we have ''a'' ∧ ''x'' in ''I''. This notion of ideal coincides with the notion of [[ring ideal]] in the Boolean ring ''A''. An ideal ''I'' of ''A'' is called ''prime'' if ''I'' ≠ ''A'' and if ''a'' ∧ ''b'' in ''I'' always implies ''a'' in ''I'' or ''b'' in ''I''. Furthermore, for every ''a'' ∈ ''A'' we have that ''a'' ∧ ''-a'' = 0 ∈ ''I'' and then ''a'' ∈ ''I'' or ''-a'' ∈ ''I'' for every ''a'' ∈ ''A'', if ''I'' is prime. An ideal ''I'' of ''A'' is called ''maximal'' if ''I'' ≠ ''A'' and if the only ideal properly containing ''I'' is ''A'' itself. For an ideal ''I'', if ''a'' ∉ ''I'' and ''-a'' ∉ ''I'', then ''I'' ∪ {''a''} or ''I'' ∪ {''-a''} is properly contained in another ideal ''J''. Hence, that an ''I'' is not maximal and therefore the notions of prime ideal and maximal ideal are equivalent in Boolean algebras. Moreover, these notions coincide with ring theoretic ones of [[prime ideal]] and [[maximal ideal]] in the Boolean ring ''A''.

The dual of an ''ideal'' is a ''filter''. A ''filter'' of the Boolean algebra ''A'' is a subset ''p'' such that for all ''x'', ''y'' in ''p'' we have ''x'' ∧ ''y'' in ''p'' and for all ''a'' in ''A'' we have ''a'' ∨ ''x'' in ''p''. The dual of a ''maximal'' (or ''prime'') ''ideal'' in a Boolean algebra is ''[[ultrafilter]]''. Ultrafilters can alternatively be described as [[2-valued morphism]]s from ''A'' to the two-element Boolean algebra. The statement ''every filter in a Boolean algebra can be extended to an ultrafilter'' is called the ''[[Boolean prime ideal theorem#The ultrafilter lemma|Ultrafilter Theorem]]'' and cannot be proven in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]], if [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] is [[consistent]]. Within ZF, it is strictly weaker than the [[axiom of choice]].
The Ultrafilter Theorem has many equivalent formulations: ''every Boolean algebra has an ultrafilter'', ''every ideal in a Boolean algebra can be extended to a prime ideal'', etc.

== Representations ==

It can be shown that every ''finite'' Boolean algebra is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra of all subsets of a finite set.  Therefore, the number of elements of every finite Boolean algebra is a [[power of two]].

[[Marshall H. Stone|Stone's]] celebrated ''[[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras|representation theorem for Boolean algebras]]'' states that ''every'' Boolean algebra ''A'' is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra of all [[clopen set|clopen]] sets in some ([[compact space|compact]] [[totally disconnected]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]) topological space.

The first axiomatization of Boolean lattices/algebras in general was given by the English philosopher and mathematician [[Alfred North Whitehead]] in 1898.&lt;ref name="PadmanabhanRudeanu2008"&gt;Padmanabhan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JlXSlpmlSv4C&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.&amp;nbsp;73]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, 1898, p.37&lt;/ref&gt;
It included the [[#Definition|above axioms]] and additionally ''x''∨1=1 and ''x''∧0=0.
In 1904, the American mathematician [[Edward V. Huntington]] (1874–1952) gave probably the most parsimonious axiomatization based on ∧, ∨, ¬, even proving the associativity laws (see box).&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, 1904, p.292-293, (first of several axiomatizations by Huntington)&lt;/ref&gt;
He also proved that these axioms are [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, 1904, p.296&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1933, Huntington set out the following elegant axiomatization for Boolean algebra.  It requires just one binary operation + and a [[unary functional symbol]] ''n'', to be read as 'complement', which satisfy the following laws:

# ''Commutativity'': ''x'' + ''y'' = ''y'' + ''x''.
# ''Associativity'': (''x'' + ''y'') + ''z'' = ''x'' + (''y'' + ''z'').
# ''Huntington equation'': ''n''(''n''(''x'') + ''y'') + ''n''(''n''(''x'') + ''n''(''y'')) = ''x''.

[[Herbert Robbins]] immediately asked: If the Huntington equation is replaced with its dual, to wit:

:4. ''Robbins Equation'': ''n''(''n''(''x'' + ''y'') + ''n''(''x'' + ''n''(''y''))) = ''x'',

do (1), (2), and (4) form a basis for Boolean algebra? Calling (1), (2), and (4) a ''Robbins algebra'', the question then becomes: Is every Robbins algebra a Boolean algebra? This question (which came to be known as the [[Robbins conjecture]]) remained open for decades, and became a favorite question of [[Alfred Tarski]] and his students. In 1996, [[William McCune]] at [[Argonne National Laboratory]], building on earlier work by Larry Wos, Steve Winker, and Bob Veroff, answered Robbins's question in the affirmative: Every Robbins algebra is a Boolean algebra. Crucial to McCune's proof was the [[automated reasoning program]] [[EQP]] he designed. For a simplification of McCune's proof, see Dahn (1998).

Removing the requirement of existence of a unit from the axioms of Boolean algebra yields "generalized Boolean algebras". Formally, a [[distributive lattice]] ''B'' is a generalized Boolean lattice, if it has a smallest element 0 and for any elements ''a'' and ''b'' in ''B'' such that ''a'' ≤ ''b'', there exists an element ''x'' such that a ∧ x = 0 and a ∨ x = b. Defining a ∖ b as the unique ''x'' such that (a ∧ b) ∨ x = a and (a ∧ b) ∧ x = 0, we say that the structure (B,∧,∨,∖,0) is a ''generalized Boolean algebra'', while (B,∨,0) is a ''generalized Boolean [[semilattice]]''. Generalized Boolean lattices are exactly the [[Ideal (order theory)|ideals]] of Boolean lattices.

A structure that satisfies all axioms for Boolean algebras except the two distributivity axioms is called an [[orthocomplemented lattice]]. Orthocomplemented lattices arise naturally in [[quantum logic]] as lattices of closed subspaces for separable [[Hilbert space]]s.

'''Chöd''' ({{bo|t=གཅོད|w=gcod}} lit. 'to sever'&lt;ref&gt;"Chöd Teachings &amp; Practice His Eminence Garchen Rinpoche January 1–5, 2011, 9:00&amp;nbsp;am to 5:00&amp;nbsp;pm Chöd literally means "to sever." What we sever is not anything in the outside world, but rather we cut through our ego-clinging, which is the very root of our afflictive emotions and suffering." - current version of http://www.garchen.net/schedule.html&lt;/ref&gt;), is a spiritual practice found primarily in the [[Nyingma]] and [[Kagyu]] schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] (where it is classed as [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]]).&lt;ref name=chaoul&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaoul|first=M Alejandro|title=Chod practice in the Bon tradition|date=2009|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=9781559392921}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as "Cutting Through the Ego,",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodhicitta.net/Chod.htm|title=Chod - Cutting Through the Ego|last=Rinpoche|first=Yangthang |year=1991|accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the practices are based on the [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]] or "Perfection of Wisdom" sutras, which expound the "[[Śūnyatā|emptiness]]" concept of [[Buddhist philosophy]].

According to [[Mahayana]] Buddhists, emptiness is the ultimate wisdom of understanding that all things lack inherent existence. Chöd combines prajñāpāramitā philosophy with specific meditation methods and  [[Vajrayana|tantric]] ritual. The chod practitioner seeks to tap the power of fear through activities such as rituals set in graveyards, and visualisation of offering their bodies in a [[ganachakra|tantric feast]] in order to put their understanding of emptiness to the ultimate test.{{sfn|Machig Labdrön|2003|p=55}}

==Nomenclature, orthography and etymology==
{{bo|t=གཅོད་སྒྲུབ་ཐབས་|w=gcod sgrub thabs}} and [[Sanskrit]] ''chedasādhanā'' both literally mean "cutting practice".

In [[Standard Tibetan]] (the prestige dialect associated with Buddhism that is based on the speech of [[Lhasa]]), the pronunciation of ''gcod'' is [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] /{{IPA|tɕøː}}/.

==Key elements of the practice==
Chöd literally means "cutting through". It cuts through [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|hindrances and obscurations]], sometimes called 'demons' or 'gods'. Examples of demons are [[ignorance]], [[anger]] and, in particular, the [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualism]] of perceiving the self as inherently meaningful, contrary to the Buddhist doctrine of [[anatta|no-self]]. The practitioner is fully immersed in the ritual:  "With a stunning array of visualizations, song, music, and prayer, it engages every aspect of one’s being and effects a powerful transformation of the interior landscape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harding|first=Sarah|title=Machik's Complete Explanation Clarifing the Meaning of Chod|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|year=2003|chapter=Preface|isbn=1-55939-182-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dzogchen]] forms of Chöd enable the practitioner to maintain [[rigpa|primordial awareness]] free from fear. Here, the Chöd ritual essentialises elements of [[phowa]], [[ganachakra|gaṇacakra]], [[pāramitā]] and [[lojong]]&lt;ref&gt;Thrangu, Khenchen &amp; Klonk, Christoph (translator) &amp; Hollmann, Gaby (editor and annotator)(2006). [http://www.rinpoche.com/teachings/chod.htm Chod – The Introduction &amp; A Few Practices]. (accessed: September 28, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Six Yogas of Naropa#Pure illusory body|pure illusory body]], [[mandala]], [[brahmavihara|brahmavihāra]], [[Ösel (yoga)|ösel]] and [[tonglen]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jigme Lingpa]] (revealed; undated); Liljenberg, Karen (translator; 2006). [http://www.zangthal.co.uk/files.html The Longchen Nyingthig Chöd Practice: "The Loud Laugh of the Dakini"]. (accessed: September 28, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chöd usually commences with phowa, in which the practitioner visualises their [[mindstream]] as the [[Five Pure Lights]] leaving the body through the aperture of the [[sahasrara]] at the top of the head. This is said to ensure psychic integrity of, and compassion for the [[sādhaka]] or practitioner.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} In most versions of the [[sādhanā]], the mindstream precipitates into a [[tulpa]] simulacrum of [[Vajrayogini|Vajrayoginī]]. In [[sambhogakāya]] attained through visualization, the sādhaka offers a gaṇachakra of their own physical body to the "four" guests: the [[Three Jewels]], [[dakini]]s, [[dharmapala]]s and beings of the [[Bhavacakra|bhavachakra]], the ever-present [[lokapala]] and the [[preta]]s. The rite may be protracted with separate offerings to each [[mandala|maṇḍala]] of guests, or significantly abridged. Many versions of the chod sādhana' still exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lionsroar.name/tantric_glossary.htm Tantric Glossary:Chöd] (September 29, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The chöd sadhana generally includes music, song and also a dance.

Chöd, like all tantric systems, has outer, inner and secret aspects. They are described in an [[evocation]] sung to Nyama Paldabum by [[Milarepa]]:
{{quote|External chod is to wander in fearful places where there are deities and demons. Internal chod is to offer one's own body as food to the deities and demons. Ultimate chod is to realize the true nature of the mind and cut through the fine strand of hair of subtle ignorance. I am the yogi who has these three kinds of chod practice.&lt;ref name="Thrangu, Khenchen 2007"&gt;Thrangu, Khenchen &amp; Klonk, Christoph (translator) &amp; Hollmann, Gaby (editor and annotator)(2006). ''Chod – The Introduction &amp; A Few Practices''. Source: [http://www.rinpoche.com/teachings/chod.htm] (accessed: November 2, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; }}
Chöd is now a staple of the advanced ''sādhana'' of Tibetan Buddhism. It is practiced worldwide following dissemination by the [[Tibetan diaspora]].

[[Vajrayogini]] is a key figure in the advanced practice of Chöd, where she appears in her Kālikā ({{bo|w=khros ma nag mo}}) or [[Vajravārāhī]] ({{bo|w=rdo rje phag mo}}) forms. The practices of Tröma Nagmo "Extremely Wrathful Black Mother" associated with the Dakini Tröma Nagmo (the black form of Vajrayogini) were also propagated by Machig Labdrön. "The particular transmission which His Holiness will give descends from [[Dudjom Lingpa]], who received it in a direct vision of the Indian Mahasiddha, [[Saraha]]. This practice emphasizes cutting through grasping at the dualistic mind to realize complete selfless compassion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omura.com/k_lingpa/Klingpa2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the forms of this style of Chöd can be found in the [[Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje|Dudjom Tersar]] lineage.

==Indian antecedents==
"Chöd was never a unique, monolithic tradition. One should really speak of Chöd tradition'''s''' and lineage'''s''' since Chöd has never constituted a school."{{sfn|Edou|1996|page=7}}

A form of Chöd was practiced in India by Buddhist [[Mahasiddha|mahāsiddha]]s prior to the 10th century.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite book|last=Edou|first=Jérôme|title=Machig Labdrön and the Foundations of Chöd|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|year=1996|isbn=978-1-55939-039-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQULAAAAYAAJ&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two practices of Chöd in Buddhism and in [[Bön]] are distinct lineages.&lt;ref name=chaoul /&gt;

There are two main Chöd traditions within Buddhism, the "Mother" and "Father" lineages. [[Dampa Sangye]] is known as the "Father of Chöd" and [[Machig Labdrön]], founder of the Mahamudra Chöd [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]]s, as the "Mother of Chöd".

Bön traces the origin of Chöd to the ''Secret Mother Tantra'', the seventh of the Nine Vehicles of Bön practice. There are four distinct styles of Chöd practice.&lt;ref name=chaoul /&gt;

Chöd developed outside the monastic system. It was subsequently adopted by the monastic lineages. As an internalization of an outer ritual, Chöd involves a form of self-sacrifice: the practitioner visualizes their own body as the offering at a ganachakra. The purpose of the practice is to engender a sense of victory and fearlessness.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} These two qualities are represented iconographically by the [[dhvaja|victory banner]] and the [[kartika (knife)|ritual knife]]. The banner symbolizes overcoming obstacles and the knife symbolizes cutting through the ego. The practitioner may cultivate imaginary fearful or painful situations since they help the practitioner's work of cutting through attachment to the self. Machig Labdrön said, "To consider adversity as a friend is the instruction of Chöd".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edou|first=Jérôme|title=Machig Labdrön and the Foundations of Chöd|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|year=1996|page=43|isbn=978-1-55939-039-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQULAAAAYAAJ&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chödpa as 'mad saints'===
[[Sarat Chandra Das]], writing at the turn of the 20th Century, equated the Chöd practitioner ({{bo|t=གཅོད་པ|w=gcod pa}}) with the Indian ''[[avadhuta|avadhūta]]'', or "mad saint".&lt;ref&gt;Sarat Chandra Das, Graham Sandberg &amp; Augustus William Heyde (1902). ''Tibetan-English Dictionary with Sanskrit Synonyms''. Calcutta, India: Bengal Secretariat Book Depot, p.20. Source: [https://books.google.com/books?id=8AbIHweo7PMC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=Avadhauts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=otPppa3w8u&amp;sig=dKZoJzveyvIBeRlj60nHoBSIBWY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=b9VwS5DEH8qHkAWYp9SFCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Avadhauts&amp;f=false] (accessed: Tuesday February 9, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Avadhūtas'' - called [[nyönpa]] in Tibetan Buddhism - are renowned for expressing their spiritual understanding through "[[crazy wisdom]]" inexplicable to ordinary people. Chöd practitioners are a type of Mad Saint particularly respected, feared or held in awe due to their roles as  denizens of the [[charnel ground]]. According to [[Tibetology|tibetologist]] Jérôme Édou, Chod practitioners were often associated with the role of [[shamanism|shaman]] and [[exorcist]]:
{{quote|The Chö[d]pa's very lifestyle on the fringe of society - dwelling in the solitude of burial grounds and haunted places, added to the mad behavior and contact with the world of darkness and mystery - was enough for credulous people to view the Chödpa in a role usually attributed to shamans and other exorcists, an assimilation which also happened to medieval European shepherds. Only someone who has visited one of Tibet's charnel fields and witnessed the offering of a corpse to the vultures may be able to understand the full impact of what the Chöd tradition refers to as places that inspire terror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edou|first=Jérôme|title=Machig Labdrön and the Foundations of Chöd|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|year=1996|isbn=978-1-55939-039-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQULAAAAYAAJ&amp;}}, p.61&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Iconography==
In Chöd, the adept symbolically offers the flesh of their body in a form of [[ganachakra|gaṇacakra]] or tantric feast. [[Iconography|Iconographically]], the skin of the practitioner's body may represent surface reality or ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]''. It is cut from bones that represent the true reality of the [[mindstream]]. Commentators have pointed out the similarities between the Chöd ritual and the prototypical [[initiation]] of a [[Shamanism|shaman]], although one writer identifies an essential difference between the two in that the shaman's initiation is involuntary whilst a Chodpa chooses to undertake the ritual death of a Chod ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alliance|first=Tsultrim|title=Women of Wisdom|year=1984|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|isbn=1559398949|page=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ijwIHDd13cC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=chod+ritual+shaman+initiation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m7wtUsD2FfOg7Abq7IGoDw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=chod%20ritual%20shaman%20initiation&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditionally, Chöd is regarded as challenging, potentially dangerous and inappropriate for some practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Eliade|Eliade, Mircea]] (1989), "Histoire des croyances et des idées religieuses" Tome 3, § 316, Ed. Payot. {{ISBN|978-2-228-88160-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ritual objects ===
[[File:Chöd practitioners at Boudhanath stupa.jpg|thumb|Chöd practitioners at Boudhanath stupa]]
Practitioners of the Chöd ritual, ''Chödpa,'' use a [[kangling]] or human thighbone trumpet, and a Chöd drum, a hand drum similar to but larger than the [[damaru|ḍamaru]] commonly used in Tibetan ritual. In a version of the Chöd [[sādhanā]] of [[Jigme Lingpa]] from the  ''[[Longchen Nyingthig]]'', five [[Kīla (Buddhism)|ritual knives]] are employed to demarcate the [[mandala|maṇḍala]] of the offering and to affix the [[five wisdoms]].&lt;ref&gt;Jigme Lingpa (revealed; undated); Liljenberg, Karen (translator; 2006)[http://www.zangthal.co.uk/files.html The Longchen Nyingthig Chöd Practice "The Loud Laugh of the Dakini"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Key to the iconography of Chöd is the [[Kartika (knife)|{{IAST|kartikā}}]] ({{bo|t=གྲི་གུ,་སྐྱི་གྲི|w=gri gu, skyi gri}}), a half-moon blade knife for skinning an animal and for [[Scraper (archaeology)|scraping hides]]. The practitioner symbolically uses a kartika to separate the [[Bodymind (in meditation traditions)|bodymind]] from the [[mindstream]] in ritual.&lt;ref name="keithdowman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keithdowman.net/essays/guide.htm|title=Keith Dowman / Buddhist Guide to the Kathmandu Valley|publisher=keithdowman.net|accessdate=2014-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kartika imagery in Chöd rituals provides the practitioner with an opportunity to realize Buddhist doctrine:{{quote|The Kartika (Skt.) or curved knife symbolizes the cutting of conventional wisdom by the ultimate insight into [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]]. It is usually present as a pair, together with the [[kapala|skullcup]], filled with wisdom nectar. On a more simple level, the skull is a reminder of (our) [[impermanence]]. Between the knife and the handle is a [[makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]]-head, a mythical monster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/tantra_symbols.html Tantric Symbols]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Origins of the practice==
[[File:Machik Labdron.jpg|thumb|Machik Labdron]]
[[File:Padampa Sanggye.jpg|thumb|Padampa Sanggye]]
Some sources have described [[Machig Labdrön]] as the founder of the practice of Chöd.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, Stephen (1973). ''The Cult of Tara''. University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-03635-2}} p.47&lt;/ref&gt;  This is accurate in that she is the founder of the Tibetan Buddhist Mahamudrā Chöd [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]]s. Machig Labdrön is credited with providing the name "Chöd" and developing unique approaches to the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Thrangu, Khenchen &amp; Klonk, Christoph (translator) &amp; Hollmann, Gaby (editor and annotator)(2006). [http://www.rinpoche.com/teachings/chod.htm Chod – The Introduction &amp; A Few Practices]. (accessed: November 2, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Biographies suggest it was transmitted to her via sources of the mahāsiddha and tantric traditions.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt; She did not found the [[Dzogchen]] lineages, although they do recognize her, and she does not appear at all in the Bön Chöd lineages.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt; Among the formative influences on Mahamudrā Chöd was [[Dampa Sangye]]'s ''Pacification of Suffering'' ({{bo|w=zhi byed}}).

===The transmission of Chöd to Tibet===
There are several [[Hagiography|hagiographic]] accounts of how Chöd came to Tibet.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;  One [[Namtar (biography)|namtar]] (spiritual biography) asserts that shortly after [[Kamalaśīla]] won his famous debate with [[Moheyan]] as to whether Tibet should adopt the "sudden" route to enlightenment or his "gradual" route, Kamalaśīla used the technique of [[phowa]] to transfer his [[mindstream]] to animate a corpse polluted with contagion in order to safely move the hazard it presented. As the mindstream of Kamalaśīla was otherwise engaged, a mahasiddha by the name of Dampa Sangye came across the vacant "physical basis"&lt;ref&gt;''kuten''&lt;/ref&gt; of Kamalaśīla. Padampa Sangye, was not karmically blessed with an aesthetic corporeal form, and upon finding the very handsome and healthy empty body of Kamalaśīla, which he assumed to be a newly dead fresh corpse, used phowa to transfer his own mindstream into Kamalaśīla's body. Padampa Sangye's mindstream in Kamalaśīla's body continued the ascent to the Himalaya and thereby transmitted the Pacification of Suffering teachings and the Indian form of Chöd which contributed to the Mahamudra Chöd of Machig Labdrön. The mindstream of Kamalaśīla was unable to return to his own body and so was forced to enter the vacant body of Padampa Sangye.&lt;ref name="Thrangu, Khenchen 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lionsroar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lionsroar.name/tantric_glossary.htm|title=Tantric Glossary|publisher=lionsroar.name|accessdate=2014-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third Karmapa: systematizer of Chöd===
Chöd was a marginal and peripheral practice, and the Chödpas who engaged in it were from outside traditional Tibetan Buddhist and Indian monastic institutions, with a contraindication against all but the most advanced practitioners to go to the [[charnel ground]]s to practice. Texts concerning Chöd were both exclusive and rare in the early tradition school.{{sfn|Edou|1996|p=7}} Indeed, due to the itinerant and nomadic lifestyles of practitioners, they could carry few texts. Hence they were also known as ''kusulu'' or ''kusulupa'', that is, studying texts rarely whilst focusing on meditation and [[praxis (process)|praxis]]: "The nonconventional attitude of living on the fringe of society kept the Chödpas aloof from the wealthy monastic institutions and printing houses. As a result, the original Chöd texts and commentaries, often copied by hand, never enjoyed any wide circulation, and many have been lost forever."{{sfn|Edou|1996|p=7}}

[[Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama]], (1284–1339) was an  important systematizer of Chöd teachings and significantly assisted in their promulgation within the literary and practice lineages of the Kagyu, Nyingma, and particularly Dzogchen.{{citation needed|date=September 2013|reason=Is Dzogchen not Nyingma?}} It is in this transition from the charnel grounds to the monastic institutions of Tibetan Buddhism that the rite of Chöd became an inner practice; the charnel ground became an internal imaginal environment. Schaeffer&lt;ref&gt;1995: p.15&lt;/ref&gt; conveys that the Third Karmapa was a systematizer of the Chöd developed by Machig Labdrön and lists a number of his works in Tibetan on Chöd. Amongst others, the works include redactions, outlines and commentaries.

{{quote|Rang byung was renowned as a systematizer of the Gcod teachings developed by Ma gcig lab sgron. His texts on Gcod include the ''Gcod kyi khrid yig''; the ''Gcod bka{{'}} tshoms chen mo{{'}}i sa bcad'' which consists of a topical outline of and commentary on Ma gcig lab sgron's  ''Shes rab kyi pha rol tu phyin pa zab mo gcod kyi man ngag gi gzhung bka{{'}} tshoms chen mo ''; the  ''Tshogs las yon tan kun {{'}}byung''; the lengthy ''Gcod kyi tshogs las rin po che{{'}}i phren ba {{'}}don bsgrigs bltas chog tu bdod pa gcod kyi lugs sor bzhag''; the ''Ma lab sgron la gsol ba {{'}}deb pa{{'}}i mgur ma''; the ''Zab mo bdud kyi gcod yil kyi khrid yig'', and finally the ''Gcod kyi nyams len''.{{sfn|Schaeffer|1995|p=15}}}}

==Western reports on Chöd practices==
Chöd was mostly practised outside the Tibetan monastery system by chödpas, who were ''[[yogi]]s'', ''[[yogini|yogiṇīs]]'' and ''[[ngagpa]]s'' rather than ''[[bhikkhu|bhikṣus]]'' and ''[[bhikkhuni|bhikṣuṇīs]]''. Because of this, material on Chöd has been less widely available to Western readers than some other tantric Buddhist practices. The first Western reports of Chöd came from a French adventurer who lived in Tibet, [[Alexandra David-Néel]] in her travelogue ''Magic and Mystery in Tibet,'' published in 1932. [[Walter Evans-Wentz]] published the first translation of a Chöd liturgy in his 1935 book ''Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines''. Anila Rinchen Palmo translated several essays about Chöd in the 1987 collection ''Cutting Through Ego-Clinging: Commentary on the practice of Tchod''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010|reason=believed translator not author}} Since then, Chöd has emerged more into the mainstream of both western scholarly and academic writings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5753">The '''Cleveland child abuse scandal''' was a 1987 wave of suspected child sexual abuse cases in [[Cleveland, England]].

==Background==
At this time, the administrative county of Cleveland, established in 1974 from parts of [[Yorkshire]] and [[County Durham]] in the [[Teesside]] area, included four main towns: [[Stockton-on-Tees]], [[Hartlepool]], [[Middlesbrough]] and [[Redcar]].&lt;ref name=Webmag&gt;{{cite news|last1=Charles|first1=Pragnell|title=The Cleveland Sexual Abuse Scandal|url=http://www.davidlane.org/children/choct2002/choct2002/pragnell%20cleveland%20abuse.html|accessdate=July 21, 2014|publisher=Children Webmag}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ceased to exist in 1996.

==History==
In the years prior to the scandal, levels of reported child abuse in the Cleveland area were consistent with those of other parts of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=Webmag/&gt; However, in 1987, during the period of February to July, many children living in Cleveland were removed from their homes by social service agencies and diagnosed as sexually abused.&lt;ref name="Gazette"/&gt; The 121 diagnoses were made by two [[pediatrics|paediatricians]] at a Middlesbrough hospital, Marietta Higgs and Geoffrey Wyatt, using the later-discredited diagnostic of [[reflex anal dilation]].&lt;ref name="Gazette"/&gt; When there were not enough foster homes in which to place the allegedly abused children, social services began to house the children in a ward at the local hospital.&lt;ref name=Webmag/&gt; 

Later, the test being used to establish child abuse was contested by the area police surgeon, and cooperation between the social workers, police and hospital doctors involved in diagnosis began to disintegrate.&lt;ref name=Webmag/&gt; In addition, there was public concern regarding the practices being used by the local social service agency, such as the removal of children from their homes in the middle of the night.&lt;ref name=Webmag/&gt; In May 1987, parents marched from the hospital where their children were being held to the local newspaper. The resulting media coverage caused the social service agency's practices to receive public scrutiny and criticism.&lt;ref name=Webmag/&gt; In response, the Butler-Sloss report was commissioned by the Secretary of State for Social Services in July 1987 and published in 1988.&lt;ref name="Gazette"/&gt;  The report was led by [[Elizabeth Butler-Sloss]] and it concluded that most of the diagnoses were incorrect.&lt;ref name="Gazette"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/20-years-cleveland-child-sex-3729871 |title=20 years on from the Cleveland Child Sex Abuse Scandal |newspaper=GazetteLive |date=8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, 94 of the 121 children were returned to their homes.&lt;ref name="Gazette"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff writer, [http://www.childrenwebmag.com/articles/key-child-care-texts/the-cleveland-reportby-judge-elizabeth-butler-sloss The Cleveland Report] digest by Robert Shaw, Children Webmag 2011, accessed July 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 October 1991, the [[Children Act 1989]] was implemented in full as a result of the Cleveland child abuse scandal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pragnall|first1=Charles|title=Torn from their mothers' arms What are social workers for?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1323">In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''conservative functor''' is a [[functor]] &lt;math&gt;F: C \to D&lt;/math&gt; such that for any [[morphism]] ''f'' in ''C'', ''F''(''f'') being an [[isomorphism]] implies that ''f'' is an isomorphism.

==Examples==
The [[forgetful functor]]s in [[abstract algebra|algebra]], such as from '''Grp''' to '''Set''', are conservative. More generally, every [[monadic functor]] is conservative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Riehl|first=Emily|year=2016|title=Category Theory in Context|publisher=[[Courier Dover Publications]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sr09DQAAQBAJ|isbn=048680903X|access-date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the forgetful functor from '''Top''' to '''Set''' is not conservative because not every [[continuous function|continuous bijection]] is a [[homeomorphism]].

Every [[faithful functor]] from a [[balanced category]] is conservative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grandis|first=Marco|year=2013|title=Homological Algebra: In Strongly Non-Abelian Settings|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kvW6CgAAQBAJ|isbn=9814425931|access-date=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4152">'''Critical friend''' has its origins in [[critical pedagogy]] education reforms in the 1970s and arose out of the self-appraisal activity which is attributed to Desmond Nuttall.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Harold (1988) "The Advisory Service and Consultancy". In Gray, H. (Ed) ''Management Consultancy in Schools'' (1988), London: Cassell&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most widely used definitions is from 1993,
{{quote|''A critical friend can be defined as a trusted person who asks provocative questions, provides data to be examined through another lens, and offers critiques of a person’s work as a friend. A critical friend takes the time to fully understand the context of the work presented and the outcomes that the person or group is working toward. The friend is an advocate for the success of that work.''&lt;ref&gt;Costa, A. and Kallick, B.(1993) "Through the Lens of a Critical Friend". ''Educational Leadership'' 51(2) 49-51&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Andrew Hutchinson, a public sector consultant, introduced the term to the Local Government Consortium at the [[University of Warwick]] in 1998 and it is cited in several papers produced by Professor Jean Hartley of the Local Government Consortium. The critical friend is characterised as falling between the extremes of the "hostile witness" and the "uncritical lover"&lt;ref&gt;Brighouse, T. and Woods, D. (1999) ''How to Improve your School''. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; whereas earlier texts go so far as to allude to Janus in discussing the concept.&lt;ref&gt;Bolam, R., Smith, G. and Canter, H. (1978) ''Local Education Authority Advisers and the Mechanisms of Innovations''. Windsor: NFER&lt;/ref&gt;

This dichotomy appealed to Hutchinson who frequently used the term while leader of the South East Midlands Citizen's Charter Quality Network run by the [[Cabinet Office]] in Whitehall. In his time running the network he came into regular contact with fellow Lancastrian and Government Minister [[Peter Kilfoyle]] MP, Public Service Minister who was responsible for the running of the networks as minister. When Kilfoyle found himself increasingly distanced from the policy agenda of Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] and he chose to resign from Government, [[Hansard]] quotes him as saying that he wished to return to the back benches but remain a "critical friend" of the Government. 

He was misquoted in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' as they claimed that he had said that he wished to be a "candid friend" to Government. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the term critical friend has its origins in the softer sounding notion of the candid friend. Nonetheless following the resignation of Peter Kilfoyle ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper (a popular publication amongst the intelligentsia and public sector middle management) began to popularise the term which is increasingly entering into general usage. The phrase is still most commonly used in education circles but its wider use in the public sector can to a large part be attributed to Andrew Hutchinson and his natural enthusiasm for the concept, being described as 'a natural critical friend acting with positive intent' in 1999 by the then Chief Executive of [[Coventry City Council]], Iain Roxburgh, who is now Director of the Warwick Research Consortium. While a variety of useful and interesting quotations are to be found on the web&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticalfriend.eu|title=criticalfriend.eu|website=www.criticalfriend.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps the reason for the popularity of the phrase is best summed up by the following quotation,
{{quote|''The Critical Friend is a powerful idea, perhaps because it contains an inherent tension. Friends bring a high degree of unconditional positive regard. Critics are, at first sight at least, conditional, negative and intolerant of failure. Perhaps the critical friend comes closest to what might be regarded as 'true friendship' – a successful marrying of unconditional support and unconditional critique.''&lt;ref&gt;A John MacBeath; Professor of Education Leadership, Cambridge University&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

[[File:171 Magnolien.JPG|thumb|Magnolia Tree, as an introduced Species in a disturbed environment]]
'''Ecosynthesis''' is the use of [[introduced species]] to fill niches in a disrupted environment, with the aim of increasing the speed of ecological restoration. This decreases the amount of physical damage done in a disrupted landscape. An example is using willow in a stream corridor for sediment and phosphorus capture.&lt;ref&gt;Tane, Hakai (1995) Ecography. Mapping and Modelling Landscape Ecosystems. Canberra: The Murray-Darling Basin Commission&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to aid ecological restoration which, is the practice of renewing and restoring degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystems and habitats in the environment by active human intervention and action. Humans ecosynthesis to make environments more suitable for life, through restoration ecology (introduced species, vegetation mapping, habitat enhancement, remediation and mitigation.) &lt;ref&gt;Holmgren, David (2002) Permaculture. Principles and Pathways beyond Sustainability. Hepburn, Victoria: Holmgren Design Services.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planetary Ecosynthesis==
[[File:Toddkessleyimagevenus.png|thumb|Earth]] A controversial science of applying ecosynthesis to other planets to make them habitable like Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Randolph, R., &amp; McKay, C. (2014). Protecting and expanding the richness and diversity of life, an ethic for astrobiology research and space exploration. International Journal of Astrobiology, 13(1), 28-34. doi:10.1017/S1473550413000311&lt;/ref&gt; This is a futuristic science that has almost no hold on society today due to its large manufacturing costs and level of technology available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://doi-org.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/10.1007/978-0-387-09796-1 Martin Beech, (2009), Terraforming: The Creating of Habitable Worlds]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration Ecology==
Ecological restoration aims to recreate, initiate, or accelerate the recovery of an ecosystem that has been disturbed.&lt;ref name=K.&gt;[https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/restoration-ecology-13339059 K. J. Vaughn Restoration Ecology, (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Revegetation''': the establishment of vegetation on sites where it has been previously lost, often with erosion control as the primary goal.

'''Habitat enhancement''': the process of increasing the suitability of a site as habitat for some desired species.

'''Remediation''': improving an existing ecosystem or creating a new one with the aim of replacing another that has deteriorated or been destroyed.

'''Mitigation''': legally mandated remediation for loss of protected species or an [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=K./&gt;

Through [[restoration ecology]] humans can help ecosystems that we have either caused harm to or disturbed be brought back to  functional state.

==Trophic Cascade==
[[File:Gray wolf (8952676448).jpg|thumb|Gray wolf in YellowStone National Park]] A clear example of humans ecosynthesiszing would be through the introduction of a species to cause a [[trophic cascade]], which is the result of indirect effects between nonadjacent trophic levels in a food chain or food web, such as the top predator in a food chain and a plant.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Eisenberg, (2010), The wolf's tooth : keystone predators, trophic cascades, and biodiversity,[https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/lib/mun/reader.action?docID=3317488]&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous example of a trophic cascade is that of the introduction of wolves to YellowStone National Park, which had extradionary effects to the ecosystem. Yellowstone National Park had a massive population of elk because they had no predators, which caused the local [[aspen]] population and other vegetation to significantly decrease in population size. However, the introduction of wolves controlled the elk population and indirectly affected the aspen and other vegetation. This brought the ecosystem back to a sustainable life.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. White, .. C. Feller, S. Bayley Forest Ecology and Management,(2003) Predation risk and the functional response of elk–aspen herbivory&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|educational assessment, including the work of [[institutional researchers]]|other uses of the term assessment|Assessment (disambiguation)}}

'''Educational assessment''' is the systematic process of [[documenting]] and using empirical data on the [[knowledge]], [[skill]], [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s, and [[belief]]s to refine programs and improve student learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=M.J.|title=Assessing Academic Programs in Higher Education|date=2004|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assessment data can be obtained from directly examining student work to assess the achievement of learning outcomes or can be based on data from which one can make inferences about learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuh|first1=G.D.|author2=Jankowski, N.|author3=Ikenberry, S.O.|title=Knowing What Students Know and Can Do: The Current State of Learning Outcomes Assessment in U.S. Colleges and Universities|date=2014|publisher=University of Illinois and Indiana University, National Institute for Learning Outcomes Assessment |location=Urbana |url=http://www.learningoutcomeassessment.org/documents/2013%20Abridged%20Survey%20Report%20Final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assessment is often used interchangeably with test, but not limited to tests.&lt;ref&gt;National council on Measurement in Education http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorA {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722194028/http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorA |date=2017-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assessment can focus on the individual learner, the learning community (class, workshop, or other organized group of learners), a course, an academic program, the institution, or the educational system as a whole (also known as [[granularity]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The word 'assessment' came into use in an educational context after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Robert|last2=Dawson|first2=Phillip|title=A contribution to the history of assessment: how a conversation simulator redeems Socratic method|journal=Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education|date=2014|volume=39|issue=2|pages=195–204|doi=10.1080/02602938.2013.798394|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02602938.2013.798394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a continuous process, assessment establishes measurable and clear student learning outcomes for learning, provisioning a sufficient amount of learning opportunities to achieve these outcomes, implementing a systematic way of gathering, analyzing and interpreting evidence to determine how well student learning matches expectations, and using the collected information to inform improvement in student learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suskie|first1=Linda|title=Assessing Student Learning|date=2004|publisher=Anker|location=Bolton, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final purpose of assessment practices in education depends on the ''theoretical framework'' of the practitioners and researchers, their assumptions and beliefs about the nature of human mind, the origin of knowledge, and the process of learning.

==Types==
The term ''assessment'' is generally used to refer to all activities teachers use to help students learn and to gauge student progress.&lt;ref name="Black Box"&gt;Black, Paul, &amp; William, Dylan (October 1998). "Inside the Black Box: Raising Standards Through Classroom Assessment."Phi Beta Kappan.

Retrieved January 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Assessment can be divided for the sake of convenience using the following categorizations:
# Initial, formative, summative and diagnostic assessment
# Objective and subjective
# Referencing (criterion-referenced, norm-referenced, and [[ipsative]])
# Informal and formal
# Internal and external

===Placement, formative, summative and diagnostic===
Assessment is often divided into initial, formative, and summative categories for the purpose of considering different objectives for assessment practices.
* Placement assessment – Placement evaluation is used to place students according to prior achievement or personal characteristics, at the most appropriate point in an instructional sequence, in a unique instructional strategy, or with a suitable teacher&lt;ref&gt;http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED041829&lt;/ref&gt; conducted through [[placement testing]], i.e. the tests that colleges and universities use to assess college readiness and place students into their initial classes. Placement evaluation, also referred to as pre-assessment or initial assessment, is conducted prior to instruction or intervention to establish a baseline from which individual student growth can be measured. This type of an assessment is used to know what the student's skill level is about the subject. It helps the teacher to explain the material more efficiently. These assessments are not graded.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mctighe |first1=Jay |last2=O'Connor |first2=Ken |title=Seven practices for effective learning|journal=Educational Leadership|date=November 2005 |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=10–17 |url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/nov05/vol63/num03/Seven-Practices-for-Effective-Learning.aspx |accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Formative assessment]] – Formative assessment is generally carried out throughout a course or project. Formative assessment, also referred to as "educative assessment," is used to aid learning. In an educational setting, formative assessment might be a teacher (or [[peer group|peer]]) or the learner, providing feedback on a student's work and would not necessarily be used for grading purposes. Formative assessments can take the form of diagnostic, standardized tests, quizzes, oral question, or draft work. Formative assessments are carried out concurrently with instructions. The result may count. The formative assessments aim to see if the students understand the instruction before doing a summative assessment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* [[Summative assessment]] – Summative assessment is generally carried out at the end of a course or project. In an educational setting, summative assessments are typically used to assign students a course grade. Summative assessments are evaluative. Summative assessments are made to summarize what the students have learned, to determine whether they understand the subject matter well. This type of assessment is typically graded (e.g. pass/fail, 0-100) and can take the form of tests, exams or projects. Summative assessments are often used to determine whether a student has passed or failed a class. A criticism of summative assessments is that they are reductive, and learners discover how well they have acquired knowledge too late for it to be of use.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* Diagnostic assessment – Diagnostic assessment deals with the whole difficulties at the end that occurs during the learning process.

Jay McTighe and Ken O'Connor proposed seven practices to effective learning.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; One of them is about showing the criteria of the evaluation before the test. Another is about the importance of pre-assessment to know what the skill levels of a student are before giving instructions. Giving a lot of feedback and encouraging are other practices.

Educational researcher Robert Stake&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/circe/Robert_Stake.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208111942/http://ed.uiuc.edu/circe/Robert_Stake.html |archive-date=2009-02-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; explains the difference between formative and summative assessment with the following analogy: {{quote|text=When the cook tastes the soup, that's formative. When the guests taste the soup, that's summative.&lt;ref name="Stake in Scriven"&gt;Scriven, M. (1991). Evaluation thesaurus. 4th ed. Newbury Park, CA:[[Sage Publications]]. {{ISBN|0-8039-4364-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Summative and formative assessment are often referred to in a learning context as ''assessment of learning'' and ''assessment for learning'' respectively. Assessment of learning is generally summative in nature and intended to measure learning outcomes and report those outcomes to students, parents and administrators. Assessment of learning generally occurs at the conclusion of a class, course, semester or academic year. Assessment for learning is generally formative in nature and is used by teachers to consider approaches to teaching and next steps for individual learners and the class.&lt;ref name="Earl, Lorna"&gt;Earl, Lorna (2003). Assessment as Learning: Using Classroom Assessment to Maximise Student Learning. Thousand Oaks, CA, Corwin Press. {{ISBN|0-7619-4626-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common form of formative assessment is ''diagnostic assessment''. Diagnostic assessment measures a student's current knowledge and skills for the purpose of identifying a suitable program of learning. ''Self-assessment'' is a form of diagnostic assessment which involves students assessing themselves. ''Forward-looking assessment'' asks those being assessed to consider themselves in hypothetical future situations.&lt;ref name="Diagnostic assessment"&gt;Reed, Daniel. "Diagnostic Assessment in Language Teaching and Learning." Center for Language Education and Research, available at [http://clear.msu.edu/clear/newsletter/files/fall2006.pdf Google.com]. Retrieved January 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Performance-based assessment'' is similar to summative assessment, as it focuses on achievement. It is often aligned with the [[standards-based education reform]] and [[outcomes-based education]] movement. Though ideally they are significantly different from a traditional multiple choice test, they are most commonly associated with [[standards-based assessment]] which use free-form responses to standard questions scored by human scorers on a standards-based scale, meeting, falling below or exceeding a performance standard rather than being ranked on a curve. A well-defined task is identified and students are asked to create, produce or do something, often in settings that involve real-world application of knowledge and skills. Proficiency is demonstrated by providing an extended response. Performance formats are further differentiated into products and performances. The performance may result in a product, such as a painting, portfolio, paper or exhibition, or it may consist of a performance, such as a speech, athletic skill, musical recital or reading.

===Objective and subjective===
Assessment (either summative or formative) is often categorized as either objective or subjective. Objective assessment is a form of questioning which has a single correct answer. Subjective assessment is a form of questioning which may have more than one correct answer (or more than one way of expressing the correct answer). There are various types of objective and subjective questions. Objective question types include true/false answers, [[multiple choice]], multiple-response and matching questions. Subjective questions include extended-response questions and essays. Objective assessment is well suited to the increasingly popular computerized or [[e-assessment|online assessment]] format.

Some have argued that the distinction between objective and subjective assessments is neither useful nor accurate because, in reality, there is no such thing as "objective" assessment. In fact, all assessments are created with inherent biases built into decisions about relevant subject matter and content, as well as cultural (class, ethnic, and gender) biases.&lt;ref name="Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)"&gt;Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC). "What Do We Mean by e-Assessment?" JISC InfoNet. Retrieved January 29, 2009 from http://tools.jiscinfonet.ac.uk/downloads/vle/eassessment-printable.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basis of comparison===
Test results can be compared against an established criterion, or against the performance of other students, or against previous performance:

*''Criterion-referenced assessment'', typically using a [[criterion-referenced test]], as the name implies, occurs when candidates are measured against defined (and objective) criteria. Criterion-referenced assessment is often, but not always, used to establish a person's competence (whether s/he can do something). The best known example of criterion-referenced assessment is the driving test, when learner drivers are measured against a range of explicit criteria (such as "Not endangering other road users").
*''Norm-referenced assessment'' (colloquially known as "[[Bell curve grading|grading on the curve]]"), typically using a [[norm-referenced test]], is not measured against defined criteria. This type of assessment is relative to the student body undertaking the assessment. It is effectively a way of comparing students. The IQ test is the best known example of norm-referenced assessment. Many entrance tests (to prestigious schools or universities) are norm-referenced, permitting a fixed proportion of students to pass ("passing" in this context means being accepted into the school or university rather than an explicit level of ability). This means that standards may vary from year to year, depending on the quality of the cohort; criterion-referenced assessment does not vary from year to year (unless the criteria change).&lt;ref name="VirginiaTech"&gt;Educational Technologies at Virginia Tech. "Assessment Purposes." VirginiaTech DesignShop: Lessons in Effective Teaching, available at [http://www.edtech.vt.edu/edtech/id/assess/purposes.html Edtech.vt.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226164716/http://www.edtech.vt.edu/edtech/id/assess/purposes.html |date=2009-02-26 }}. Retrieved January 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Ipsative assessment]]'' is self comparison either in the same domain over time, or comparative to other domains within the same student.

===Informal and formal===
Assessment can be either ''formal'' or ''informal''. Formal assessment usually implies a written document, such as a test, quiz, or paper. A formal assessment is given a numerical score or grade based on student performance, whereas an informal assessment does not contribute to a student's final grade. An informal assessment usually occurs in a more casual manner and may include observation, inventories, checklists, rating scales, [[rubric (academic)|rubrics]], performance and portfolio assessments, participation, peer and self-evaluation, and discussion.&lt;ref name="Valencia, Sheila W"&gt;Valencia, Sheila W.

Understanding Authentic Classroom-Based Literacy Assessment (1997), available at [http://www.eduplace.com/rdg/res/litass/forms.html Eduplace.com]. Retrieved January 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal and external===
Internal assessment is set and marked by the school (i.e. teachers). Students get the mark and feedback regarding the assessment. External assessment is set by the governing body, and is marked by non-biased personnel. Some external assessments give much more limited feedback in their marking. However, in tests such as Australia's NAPLAN, the criterion addressed by students is given detailed feedback in order for their teachers to address and compare the student's learning achievements and also to plan for the future.

==Standards of quality==
In general, high-quality assessments are considered those with a high level of [[reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[validity (statistics)|validity]]. Approaches to reliability and validity vary, however.

===Reliability===
[[Reliability (statistics)|Reliability]] relates to the consistency of an assessment. A reliable assessment is one that consistently achieves the same results with the same (or similar) cohort of students. Various factors affect reliability—including ambiguous questions, too many options within a question paper, vague marking instructions and poorly trained markers. Traditionally, the reliability of an assessment is based on the following:
# Temporal stability: Performance on a test is comparable on two or more separate occasions.
# Form equivalence: Performance among examinees is equivalent on different forms of a test based on the same content.
# Internal consistency: Responses on a test are consistent across questions. For example: In a survey that asks respondents to rate attitudes toward technology, consistency would be expected in responses to the following questions:
#* "I feel very negative about computers in general."
#* "I enjoy using computers."&lt;ref name="Yu, Chong Ho"&gt;Yu, Chong Ho (2005). "Reliability and Validity." Educational Assessment. Available at [http://www.creative-wisdom.com/teaching/assessment/reliability.html Creative-wisdom.com]. Retrieved January 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reliability of a measurement x can also be defined quantitatively as:
'''&lt;math&gt;R_\text{x} = V_\text{t}/V_\text{x}&lt;/math&gt;''' where &lt;math&gt;R_\text{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the reliability in the observed (test) score, x; 
&lt;math&gt;V_\text{t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_\text{x}&lt;/math&gt; are the variability in ‘true’ (i.e., candidate’s innate performance) and measured test scores respectively. &lt;math&gt;R_\text{x}&lt;/math&gt; can range from 0 (completely unreliable), to 1 (completely reliable).
===Validity===
{{Main|Test validity}}

[[validity (statistics)|Valid]] assessment is one that measures what it is intended to measure. For example, it would not be valid to assess driving skills through a written test alone. A more valid way of assessing driving skills would be through a combination of tests that help determine what a driver knows, such as through a written test of driving knowledge, and what a driver is able to do, such as through a performance assessment of actual driving. Teachers frequently complain that some examinations do not properly assess the [[syllabus]] upon which the examination is based; they are, effectively, questioning the validity of the exam.
 
Validity of an assessment is generally gauged through examination of evidence in the following categories:
# Content – Does the content of the test measure stated objectives?
# Criterion – Do scores correlate to an outside reference? (ex: Do high scores on a 4th grade reading test accurately predict reading skill in future grades?)
# Construct – Does the assessment correspond to other significant variables? (ex: Do [[English as a second language|ESL]] students consistently perform differently on a writing exam than native English speakers?)&lt;ref name="Moskal, Barbara M., &amp; Leydens, Jon A"&gt;Moskal, Barbara M., &amp; Leydens, Jon A (2000). "Scoring Rubric Development: Validity and Reliability." Practical Assessment, Research &amp; Evaluation, 7(10). Retrieved January 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A good assessment has both validity and reliability, plus the other quality attributes noted above for a specific context and purpose. In practice, an assessment is rarely totally valid or totally reliable. A ruler which is marked wrongly will always give the same (wrong) measurements. It is very reliable, but not very valid. Asking random individuals to tell the time without looking at a clock or watch is sometimes used as an example of an assessment which is valid, but not reliable. The answers will vary between individuals, but the average answer is probably close to the actual time. In many fields, such as medical research, educational testing, and psychology, there will often be a trade-off between reliability and validity. A history test written for high validity will have many essay and fill-in-the-blank questions. It will be a good measure of mastery of the subject, but difficult to score completely accurately. A history test written for high reliability will be entirely multiple choice. It isn't as good at measuring knowledge of history, but can easily be scored with great precision. We may generalize from this. The more reliable our estimate is of what we purport to measure, the less certain we are that we are actually measuring that aspect of attainment.

It is well to distinguish between "subject-matter" validity and "predictive" validity. The former, used widely in education, predicts the score a student would get on a similar test but with different questions. The latter, used widely in the workplace, predicts performance. Thus, a subject-matter-valid test of knowledge of driving rules is appropriate while a predictively valid test would assess whether the potential driver could follow those rules.

===Evaluation standards===
In the field of [[evaluation]], and in particular [[educational evaluation]], the [[Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation]] has published three sets of standards for evaluations. "The Personnel Evaluation Standards"&lt;ref&gt;Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation. (1988). "The Personnel Evaluation Standards: How to Assess Systems for Evaluating Educators". Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1988, ''The Program Evaluation Standards'' (2nd edition)&lt;ref&gt;Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation. (1994).''The Program Evaluation Standards'', 2nd Edition. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1994, and ''The Student Evaluation Standards''&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation. (2003). ''The Student Evaluation Standards: How to Improve Evaluations of Students''. Newbury Park, CA: Corwin Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 2003.

Each publication presents and elaborates a set of standards for use in a variety of educational settings. The standards provide guidelines for designing, implementing, assessing and improving the identified form of evaluation. Each of the standards has been placed in one of four fundamental categories to promote educational evaluations that are proper, useful, feasible, and accurate. In these sets of standards, validity and reliability considerations are covered under the accuracy topic. For example, the student accuracy standards help ensure that student evaluations will provide sound, accurate, and credible information about student learning and performance.

==Summary table of the main theoretical frameworks==
The following table summarizes the main ''theoretical frameworks'' behind almost all the theoretical and research work, and the instructional practices in education (one of them being, of course, the practice of assessment). These different frameworks have given rise to interesting debates among scholars.

==Controversy==
Concerns over how best to apply assessment practices across public school systems have largely focused on questions about the use of high-stakes testing and standardized tests, often used to gauge student progress, teacher quality, and school-, district-, or statewide educational success.

===No Child Left Behind===
For most researchers and practitioners, the question is not whether tests should be administered at all—there is a general consensus that, when administered in useful ways, tests can offer useful information about student progress and curriculum implementation, as well as offering formative uses for learners.&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;American Psychological Association. "Appropriate Use of High-Stakes Testing in Our Nation's Schools." APA Online, available at &lt;!--&lt;s&gt;www.apa.org/pubinfo/testing.html. Retrieved January 29, 2009.&lt;/s&gt; Unnecessary to leave this here.--&gt; [http://www.apa.org/pubs/info/brochures/testing.aspx APA.org], Retrieved January 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The real issue, then, is whether testing practices as currently implemented can provide these services for educators and students.

President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) on January 8, 2002.  The NCLB Act reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965.  President Johnson signed the ESEA to help fight the War on Poverty and helped fund elementary and secondary schools.  President Johnson's goal was to emphasizes equal access to education and establishes high standards and accountability.  The NCLB Act required states to develop assessments in basic skills. To receive federal school funding, states had to give these assessments to all students at select grade level.

In the U.S., the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] mandates standardized testing nationwide. These tests align with state curriculum and link teacher, student, district, and state accountability to the results of these tests. Proponents of NCLB argue that it offers a tangible method of gauging educational success, holding teachers and schools accountable for failing scores, and closing the [[achievement gap]] across class and ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.ed.gov/nclb/landing.jhtml Reauthorization of NCLB]. Department of Education. Retrieved 1/29/09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of standardized testing dispute these claims, arguing that holding educators accountable for test results leads to the practice of "[[teaching to the test]]." Additionally, many argue that the focus on standardized testing encourages teachers to equip students with a narrow set of skills that enhance test performance without actually fostering a deeper understanding of subject matter or key principles within a knowledge domain.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.fairtest.org/facts/whatwron.htm What's Wrong With Standardized Testing?] FairTest.org. Retrieved January 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-stakes testing===
{{Main|High-stakes testing}}
The assessments which have caused the most controversy in the U.S. are the use of [[high school graduation examination]]s, which are used to deny diplomas to students who have attended high school for four years, but cannot demonstrate that they have learned the required material when writing exams. Opponents say that no student who has put in four years of [[seat time]] should be denied a high school diploma merely for repeatedly failing a test, or even for not knowing the required material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reform education, not exit exams |work=Daily Bruin |author=Dang, Nick |date=18 March 2003 |quote=One common complaint from failed test-takers is that they weren't taught the tested material in school.

High-stakes tests have been blamed for causing sickness and [[test anxiety]] in students and teachers, and for teachers choosing to narrow the curriculum towards what the teacher believes will be tested. In an exercise designed to make children comfortable about testing, a [[Spokane, Washington]] newspaper published a picture of a [[monster]] that feeds on fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www2.asd.wednet.edu/Pioneer/barnard/projects/04-05/art/WhatsaWASL/index.html |title=ASD.wednet.edu |access-date=2006-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225033809/http://www2.asd.wednet.edu/Pioneer/barnard/projects/04-05/art/WhatsaWASL/index.html |archive-date=2007-02-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The published image is purportedly the response of a student who was asked to draw a picture of what she thought of the state assessment.

Other critics, such as Washington State University's [[Don Orlich]], question the use of test items far beyond standard cognitive levels for students' age.&lt;ref name="Bach, Deborah, &amp; Blanchard, Jessica"&gt;Bach, Deborah, &amp; Blanchard, Jessica (April 19, 2005). "WASL worries stress kids, schools." Seattle Post-Intelligencer. Retrieved January 30, 2009 from [http://www.seattlepi.com/local/220713_wasl19.html Seattlepi.nwsource.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to portfolio assessments, simple multiple-choice tests are much less expensive, less prone to disagreement between scorers, and can be scored quickly enough to be returned before the end of the school year. [[Standardized test]]s (all students take the same test under the same conditions) often use multiple-choice tests for these reasons. Orlich criticizes the use of expensive, holistically graded tests, rather than inexpensive multiple-choice "bubble tests", to measure the quality of both the system and individuals for very large numbers of students.&lt;ref name="Bach, Deborah, &amp; Blanchard, Jessica"/&gt; Other prominent critics of high-stakes testing include [[Fairtest]] and [[Alfie Kohn]].

The use of [[IQ tests]] has been banned in some states for educational decisions, and [[norm-referenced tests]], which rank students from "best" to "worst", have been criticized for bias against minorities. Most education officials support [[criterion-referenced tests]] (each individual student's score depends solely on whether he answered the questions correctly, regardless of whether his neighbors did better or worse) for making high-stakes decisions.

===21st century assessment===
It has been widely noted that with the emergence of [[social media]] and [[Web 2.0]] technologies and mindsets, learning is increasingly collaborative and knowledge increasingly distributed across many members of a learning community. Traditional assessment practices, however, focus in large part on the individual and fail to account for knowledge-building and learning in context. As researchers in the field of assessment consider the cultural shifts that arise from the emergence of a more [[participatory culture]], they will need to find new methods of applying assessments to learners.&lt;ref name="Fadel, Charles, Honey, Margaret, &amp; Pasnik, Shelley"&gt;Fadel, Charles, Honey, Margaret, &amp; Pasnik, Shelley (May 18, 2007). "Assessment in the Age of Innovation." Education Week. Retrieved January 29, 2009 from http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2007/05/23/38fadel.h26.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment in a democratic school===
[[Sudbury model]] of democratic education schools do not perform and do not offer assessments, evaluations, transcripts, or recommendations, asserting that they do not rate people, and that school is not a judge; comparing students to each other, or to some standard that has been set is for them a violation of the student's [[right to privacy]] and to self-determination. Students decide for themselves how to measure their progress as self-starting learners as a process of self-evaluation: real lifelong learning and the proper educational assessment for the 21st century, they adduce.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (2000). [http://sudburyvalleyschool.org/essays/102008.shtml ''21st Century Schools,''] edited transcript of a talk delivered at the April 2000 International Conference on Learning in the 21st Century.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sudbury schools, this policy does not cause harm to their students as they move on to life outside the school. However, they admit it makes the process more difficult, but that such hardship is part of the students learning to make their own way, set their own standards and meet their own goals.

The no-grading and no-rating policy helps to create an atmosphere free of competition among students or battles for adult approval, and encourages a positive cooperative environment amongst the student body.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D. (1987). Chapter 20,''Evaluation,'' Free at Last — The Sudbury Valley School.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final stage of a Sudbury education, should the student choose to take it, is the graduation thesis. Each student writes on the topic of how they have prepared themselves for adulthood and entering the community at large. This thesis is submitted to the Assembly, who reviews it. The final stage of the thesis process is an oral defense given by the student in which they open the floor for questions, challenges and comments from all Assembly members. At the end, the Assembly votes by secret ballot on whether or not to award a diploma.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081016150834/http://www.mountainlaurelsudbury.org/thesis-procedure.asp ''Graduation Thesis Procedure''], Mountain Laurel Sudbury School.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessing ELL students===
A major concern with the use of educational assessments is the overall validity, accuracy, and fairness when it comes to assessing English language learners (ELL). The majority of assessments within the United States have normative standards based on the English-speaking culture, which does not adequately represent ELL populations.&lt;ref name="ehis.ebscohost.com.libdata.lib.ua.edu"&gt;http://ehis.ebscohost.com.libdata.lib.ua.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=221ae7c6-6895-4b02-bc69-759936218fba%40sessionmgr104&amp;vid=12&amp;hid=20{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, it would in many cases be inaccurate and inappropriate to draw conclusions from ELL students’ normative scores. Research shows that the majority of schools do not appropriately modify assessments in order to accommodate students from unique cultural backgrounds.&lt;ref name="ehis.ebscohost.com.libdata.lib.ua.edu"/&gt; This has resulted in the over-referral of ELL students to special education, causing them to be disproportionately represented in special education programs. Although some may see this inappropriate placement in special education as supportive and helpful, research has shown that inappropriately placed students actually regressed in progress.&lt;ref name="ehis.ebscohost.com.libdata.lib.ua.edu"/&gt;

It is often necessary to utilize the services of a translator in order to administer the assessment in an ELL student’s native language; however, there are several issues when translating assessment items. One issue is that translations can frequently suggest a correct or expected response, changing the difficulty of the assessment item.&lt;ref name="nasponline.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasponline.org/publications/cq/pdf/V38N7_CulturallyCompetentAssessment.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529041906/http://www.nasponline.org/publications/cq/pdf/V38N7_CulturallyCompetentAssessment.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the translation of assessment items can sometimes distort the original meaning of the item.&lt;ref name="nasponline.org"/&gt; Finally, many translators are not qualified or properly trained to work with ELL students in an assessment situation.&lt;ref name="ehis.ebscohost.com.libdata.lib.ua.edu"/&gt; All of these factors compromise the validity and fairness of assessments, making the results not reliable. Nonverbal assessments have shown to be less discriminatory for ELL students, however, some still present cultural biases within the assessment items.&lt;ref name="nasponline.org"/&gt;

When considering an ELL student for special education the assessment team should integrate and interpret all of the information collected in order to ensure a non biased conclusion.&lt;ref name="nasponline.org"/&gt; The decision should be based on multidimensional sources of data including teacher and parent interviews, as well as classroom observations.&lt;ref name="nasponline.org"/&gt; Decisions should take the students unique cultural, linguistic, and experiential backgrounds into consideration, and should not be strictly based on assessment results.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3176">'''Embourgeoisement''' is the theory that posits the migration of individuals into the [[bourgeoisie]] as a result of their own efforts or collective action, such as that taken by unions in the US and elsewhere in the 1930s to the 1960s{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} that established middle class status for factory [[workers]] and others that would not have been considered middle class by their employments, allowing increasing numbers of what might traditionally be classified as working-class people to assume the lifestyle and individualistic values of the so-called middle classes and hence reject commitment to collective social and economic goals. The opposite process is [[proletarianization]]. Sociologist [[John Goldthorpe]] disputed the embourgeoisement thesis in 1967.
&lt;ref name="Goldthorpe_1967"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldthorpe|first1=John|last2=Lockwood|first2=David|last3=Bechhoffer|first3=Frank|last4=Platt|first4=Jennifer|title=The Affluent Worker and the Theory of Embourgeoisement|journal=Sociology|date=January 1967|volume=1|issue=1|pages=11–31|doi=10.1177/003803856700100102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

describes this change to be a result of the  post-industrialization of society, in which there are far fewer manual labor jobs, which is the main classification of blue-collar work.  With post-industrialization, former upper-level blue-collar workers are moving to white-collar work because of the decreased availability and prestige of manual labor jobs.  Even when their actual jobs do not change, their lifestyles based on their job situation often change into a lifestyle that according to Mayer and Buckley, more closely resembles the lower-middle class than the rest of the lower blue-collar workers.  The result of this idea of embourgeoisement is that more people are incorporated into the middle-class.  As a result, there is decreased [[class consciousness]] and declining working class solidarity

.  This in turn could lead to less group action among the lower class if trying to get more rights or changes within their job field. 
The topic was widely discussed in academic circles in the 1960s following the publication of ''The Affluent Worker in the Class Structure'' {{ISBN|0-521-09533-6}} by [[John H. Goldthorpe]] in 1963.

The situation in [[Great Britain]] at the time is described in the book ''Must Labour Lose?'', written by [[Mark Abrams]] and [[Richard Rose (political scientist)|Richard Rose]].

In [[mathematics]], the '''Farey sequence''' of order ''n'' is the [[sequence]] of completely reduced [[vulgar fraction|fraction]]s, either between 0 and 1, or without this restriction,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivan M. Niven]] and Herbert S. Zuckerman, ''An Introduction to the theory of numbers'', third edition, John Wiley and Sons 1972, Definition 6.1. ''"The sequence of all reduced fractions with denominators not exceeding n, listed in order of their size, is called the Farey sequence of order n."'' With the comment: ''"This definition of the Farey sequences seems to be the most convenient. However, some authors prefer to restrict the fractions to the interval from 0 to 1."''&lt;/ref&gt; which when [[in lowest terms]] have [[denominator]]s less than or equal to ''n'', arranged in order of increasing size.

With the restricted definition, each Farey sequence starts with the value 0, denoted by the fraction &lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and ends with the value 1, denoted by the fraction &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (although some authors omit these terms).

A Farey sequence is sometimes called a Farey [[series (mathematics)|series]],{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} which is not strictly correct, because the terms are not summed. 

==Examples==
The Farey sequences of orders 1 to 8 are :
:''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = { {{sfrac|0|1}}&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt; {{sfrac|1|1}} }
:''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = { {{sfrac|0|1}}&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt; {{sfrac|1|2}}&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt; {{sfrac|1|1}} }
:''F''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = { {{sfrac|0|1}}&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt; {{sfrac|1|3}}&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt; {{sfrac|1|2}}&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt; {{sfrac|2|3}}&lt;sub&gt;,&lt;/sub&gt; {{sfrac|1|1}} }

Farey sequences are named after the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[geologist]] [[John Farey, Sr.]], whose letter about these sequences was published in the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'' in 1816. Farey conjectured, without offering proof, that each new term in a Farey sequence expansion is the [[mediant (mathematics)|mediant]] of its neighbours. Farey's letter was read by [[Cauchy]], who provided a proof in his ''Exercices de mathématique'', and attributed this result to Farey. In fact, another mathematician, [[Charles Haros]], had published similar results in 1802 which were not known either to Farey or to Cauchy.&lt;ref name=Beiler/&gt; Thus it was a historical accident that linked Farey's name with these sequences. This is an example of [[Stigler's law of eponymy]].

==Properties==
[[File:Farey diagram circle packing 5.png|thumb]]
===Sequence length and index of a fraction===
The Farey sequence of order ''n'' contains all of the members of the Farey sequences of lower orders. In particular ''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' contains all of the members of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; and also contains an additional fraction for each number that is less than ''n'' and [[coprime]] to ''n''. Thus ''F''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; consists of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; together with the fractions {{sfrac|1|6}} and {{sfrac|5|6}}. 

The middle term of a Farey sequence ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is always {{sfrac|1|2}}, 
for ''n'' &gt; 1. From this, we can relate the lengths of ''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; using [[Euler's totient function]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt; :

:&lt;math&gt;|F_n| = |F_{n-1}| + \varphi(n).&lt;/math&gt;

Using the fact that |''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;| = 2, we can derive an expression for the length of ''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|A005728}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;|F_n| = 1 + \sum_{m=1}^n \varphi(m).&lt;/math&gt;

We also have :

:&lt;math&gt;|F_n| = \frac{1}{2}\left(3+\sum_{d=1}^n\mu(d)\left\lfloor\tfrac{n}{d}\right\rfloor^2\right),&lt;/math&gt;
and by a [[Möbius inversion formula]] : 
:&lt;math&gt;|F_n| = \frac{1}{2}(n+3)n-\sum_{d=2}^n|F_{\lfloor n/d\rfloor}|,&lt;/math&gt;
where µ(''d'') is the number-theoretic [[Möbius function]], and  &lt;math&gt;\lfloor \tfrac{n}{d} \rfloor &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor function]]. 

The asymptotic behaviour of |''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''| is :

:&lt;math&gt;|F_n| \sim \frac {3n^2}{\pi^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The index &lt;math&gt;I_n(a_{k,n})=k&lt;/math&gt; of a fraction &lt;math&gt;a_{k,n}&lt;/math&gt; in the Farey sequence &lt;math&gt;F_n=\{a_{k,n} : k = 0, 1, \ldots, m_n\}&lt;/math&gt; is simply the position that &lt;math&gt;a_{k,n}&lt;/math&gt;  occupies in the sequence. This is of special relevance as it is used in an alternative formulation of the [[Riemann hypothesis]], see [[#Riemann_hypothesis|below]]. Various useful properties follow:

:&lt;math&gt;I_n(0/1) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I_n(1/n) = 1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I_n(1/2) = (|F_n|-1)/2,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I_n(1/1) = |F_n|-1 ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I_n(h/k) = |F_n|-1-I_n((k-h)/k).&lt;/math&gt;

The index of &lt;math&gt;1/k&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n/(i+1) &lt; k \leq n/i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[least common multiple]] of the first &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; numbers, &lt;math&gt;n={\rm lcm}([2,i]) &lt;/math&gt;, is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Tomas |first=Rogelio |eprint=1802.07792 |title=Partial Franel sums |class=math.NT |date=2018}} Accessed: November 18, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;I_n(1/k) = 1 + n \sum_{j=1}^{i} \frac{\varphi(j)}{j} - k\Phi(i).&lt;/math&gt;

===Farey neighbours&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Farey pair]] --&gt;===
Fractions which are neighbouring terms in any Farey sequence are known as a ''Farey pair'' and have the following properties.

If {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} and {{sfrac|''c''|''d''}} are neighbours in a Farey sequence, with {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''c''|''d''}}, then their difference {{sfrac|''c''|''d''}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} is equal to {{sfrac|1|''bd''}}.{{why|date=May 2018}} Since 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{d} - \frac{a}{b} = \frac{bc - ad}{bd},&lt;/math&gt;

this is equivalent to saying that 

:&lt;math&gt;bc - ad = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus {{sfrac|1|3}} and {{sfrac|2|5}} are neighbours in ''F''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, and their difference is {{sfrac|1|15}}.

The converse is also true. If 

:&lt;math&gt;bc - ad = 1&lt;/math&gt;

for positive integers ''a'',''b'',''c'' and ''d'' with ''a'' &lt; ''b'' and ''c'' &lt; ''d'' then {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} and {{sfrac|''c''|''d''}} will be neighbours in the Farey sequence of order max(''b,d'').

If {{sfrac|''p''|''q''}} has neighbours {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} and {{sfrac|''c''|''d''}} in some Farey sequence, with 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} &lt; \frac{p}{q} &lt; \frac{c}{d} &lt;/math&gt;

then {{sfrac|''p''|''q''}} is the [[mediant (mathematics)|mediant]] of {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} and {{sfrac|''c''|''d''}} &amp;ndash; in other words, 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{q} = \frac{a + c}{b + d}.&lt;/math&gt;

This follows easily from the previous property, since if {{nowrap|1=''bp'' – ''aq'' = ''qc'' – ''pd'' = 1}}, then {{nowrap|1=''bp'' + ''pd'' = ''qc'' + ''aq''}}, {{nowrap|1=''p''(''b'' + ''d'') = ''q''(''a'' + ''c'')}}, {{nowrap|1={{sfrac|''p''|''q''}} = {{sfrac|''a'' + ''c''|''b'' + ''d''}}}}.

It follows that if {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} and {{sfrac|''c''|''d''}} are neighbours in a Farey sequence then the first term that appears between them as the order of the Farey sequence is incremented is 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a+c}{b+d},&lt;/math&gt;

which first appears in the Farey sequence of order {{nowrap|''b'' + ''d''}}.

Thus the first term to appear between {{sfrac|1|3}} and {{sfrac|2|5}} is {{sfrac|3|8}}, which appears in ''F''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;.

The ''[[Stern–Brocot tree]]'' is a data structure showing how the sequence is built up from 0 (= {{sfrac|0|1}}) and 1 (= {{sfrac|1|1}}), by taking successive mediants.

Fractions that appear as neighbours in a Farey sequence have closely related [[continued fraction]] expansions. Every fraction has two continued fraction expansions &amp;mdash; in one the final term is 1; in the other the final term is greater than 1. If {{sfrac|''p''|''q''}}, which first appears in Farey sequence ''F&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'', has continued fraction expansions

:[0; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, 1]
:[0; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; + 1]

then the nearest neighbour of {{sfrac|''p''|''q''}} in ''F&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'' (which will be its neighbour with the larger denominator) has a continued fraction expansion

:[0; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]

and its other neighbour has a continued fraction expansion 

:[0; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sub&gt;]

For example, {{sfrac|3|8}} has the two continued fraction expansions {{nowrap|[0; 2, 1, 1, 1]}} and {{nowrap|[0; 2, 1, 2]}}, and its neighbours in ''F''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; are {{sfrac|2|5}}, which can be expanded as {{nowrap|[0; 2, 1, 1]}}; and {{sfrac|1|3}}, which can be expanded as {{nowrap|[0; 2, 1]}}.

===Applications===
Farey sequences are very useful to find rational approximations of irrational numbers.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nrich.maths.org/6596 Farey Approximation]", ''NRICH.maths.org''. Accessed: 18 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In physics systems featuring resonance phenomena Farey sequences provide a very elegant and efficient method to compute resonance locations in 1D&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite arXiv |last1=Zhenhua Li |first1=A. |last2=Harter |first2=W.G. |eprint=1308.4470v1 |title=Quantum Revivals of Morse Oscillators and Farey-Ford Geometry |class=quant-ph |date=2013}} Accessed: November 18, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and 2D.&lt;ref&gt;Tomas, R. (2014). "[http://prst-ab.aps.org/abstract/PRSTAB/v17/i1/e014001 From Farey sequences to resonance diagrams]", ''prst-ab.aps.org''. Accessed: 18 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ford circles===
[[File:Comparison_Ford_circles_Farey_diagram.svg|thumb|250px|Comparison of Ford circles and a Farey diagram with circular arcs for ''n'' from 1 to 9. Note that each arc intersects its corresponding circles at right angles. In [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Comparison_Ford_circles_Farey_diagram.svg the SVG image], hover over a circle or curve to highlight it and its terms.]]

There is a connection between Farey sequence and [[Ford circle]]s.

For every fraction ''p''/''q'' (in its lowest terms) there is a Ford circle C[''p''/''q''], which is the circle with radius 1/(2''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and centre at (''p''/''q'', 1/(2''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)). Two Ford circles for different fractions are either [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] or they are [[tangent]] to one another—two Ford circles never intersect. If 0 &lt; ''p''/''q'' &lt; 1 then the Ford circles that are tangent to C[''p''/''q''] are precisely the Ford circles for fractions that are neighbours of ''p''/''q'' in some Farey sequence.

Thus ''C''[2/5] is tangent to ''C''[1/2], ''C''[1/3], ''C''[3/7], ''C''[3/8] etc.

===Riemann hypothesis===
Farey sequences are used in two equivalent formulations of the [[Riemann hypothesis]]. Suppose the terms of &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\{a_{k,n} : k = 0, 1, \ldots, m_n\}&lt;/math&gt;. Define &lt;math&gt;d_{k,n} = a_{k,n} - k/m_n&lt;/math&gt;, in other words &lt;math&gt;d_{k,n}&lt;/math&gt; is the difference between the ''k''th term of the ''n''th Farey sequence, and the ''k''th member of a set of the same number of points, distributed evenly on the unit interval. In 1924 [[Jérôme Franel]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/resolveppn/?PID=GDZPPN00250653X Les suites de Farey et le problème des nombres premiers]", ''Nachrichten von der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, Mathematisch-Physikalische Klasse'' 1924, 198-201. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved that the statement

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{m_n} d_{k,n}^2 = O (n^r)\quad\forall r&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;

is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis, and then [[Edmund Landau]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/resolveppn/?PID=GDZPPN002506548 Bemerkungen zu der vorstehenden Abhandlung von Herrn Franel]", ''Nachrichten von der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, Mathematisch-Physikalische Klasse'' 1924, 202-206. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; remarked (just after Franel's paper) that the statement

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{m_n} |d_{k,n}| = O (n^r)\quad\forall r&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;

is also equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis.

==Next term==

A surprisingly simple algorithm exists to generate the terms of ''F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' in either traditional order (ascending) or non-traditional order (descending). The algorithm computes each successive entry in terms of the previous two entries using the mediant property given above. If {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} and {{sfrac|''c''|''d''}} are the two given entries, and {{sfrac|''p''|''q''}} is the unknown next entry, then {{sfrac|''c''|''d''}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''p''|''b''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''q''}}. Since {{sfrac|''c''|''d''}} is in lowest terms,  there must be an integer ''k'' such that ''kc''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''p'' and ''kd''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''q'', giving ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''kc''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a'' and ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''kd''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''b''. If we consider ''p'' and ''q'' to be functions of ''k'', then
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{p(k)}{q(k)}- \frac{c}{d} = \frac{cb - da}{d(kd - b)}&lt;/math&gt;
so the larger ''k'' gets, the closer {{sfrac|''p''|''q''}} gets to {{sfrac|''c''|''d''}}.

To give the next term in the sequence ''k'' must be as large as possible, subject to ''kd''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'' (as we are only considering numbers with denominators not greater than ''n''), so ''k'' is the greatest integer&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''|''d''}}. Putting this value of ''k'' back into the equations for ''p'' and ''q'' gives
:&lt;math&gt; p = \left\lfloor\frac{n+b}{d}\right\rfloor c - a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; q = \left\lfloor\frac{n+b}{d}\right\rfloor d - b&lt;/math&gt;

This is implemented in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] as:
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
def farey_function(n, descending=False):
    """Print the nth Farey sequence, either ascending or descending."""
    a, b, c, d = 0, 1, 1, n
    if descending: 
        a, c = 1, n-1
    print "%d/%d" % (a,b)
    while (c &lt;= n and not descending) or (a &gt; 0 and descending):
        k = int((n + b) / d)
        a, b, c, d = c, d, (k*c-a), (k*d-b)
        print "%d/%d" % (a,b)
&lt;/source&gt;

Brute-force searches for solutions to [[Diophantine equation]]s in rationals can often take advantage of the Farey series (to search only reduced forms).  The lines marked (*) can also be modified to include any two adjacent terms so as to generate terms only larger (or smaller) than a given term.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Routledge, "Computing Farey Series," ''[[The Mathematical Gazette]]'', Vol. ''' 92 ''' (No. 523), 55&amp;ndash;62 (March 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Four continents.png|thumb|The classical four continents]]

Europeans in the 16th century divided the world into '''four continents''': [[Africa]], [[Americas|America]], [[Asia]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Nothing was known of [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], first sighted in the early seventeenth century, or  [[Antarctica]], first sighted in the nineteenth century.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the four [[continents]] was seen to represent its quadrant of the world&amp;mdash;Europe in the north, Asia in the east, Africa in the south, and America in the west. This division fit the [[Renaissance]] sensibilities of the time, which also divided the world into four [[season]]s, four [[classical element]]s, four [[cardinal directions]], four classical [[virtues]], etc.

The '''four parts of the world'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ciappara|first=Frans|date=1998|url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/4672/1/4672_2141.PDF?UkUDh:CyT|title=Society and inquisition in Malta 1743-1798|publisher=Durhem E-Theses|location=[[Durham University]]|page=38|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''four corners of the world''' refers to the [[Americas]] (the "west"), [[Europe]] (the "north"), [[Asia]] (the "east"), and [[Africa]] (the "south"). 

==A three-cornered world==
[[File:Anaximander world map-en.svg|thumb|The ancient tripartite view of the world]]
Before the discovery of the [[New World]] a commonplace of classical and medieval geography had been the "three parts" in which, from Mediterranean and European perspectives, the world was divided: Europe, Asia and Africa. As [[Laurent de Premierfait]], the pre-eminent French translator of Latin literature in the early fifteenth century, informed his readers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Asia is one of the three parts of the world, which the authors divide in Asia, Africa and Europe. Asia extends towards the [[Orient]] as far as the rising sun (''"devers le [[Levant|souleil levant]]"''&lt;!--souliel in original: the spelling has been carefully proofread--&gt;), towards the south ("midi") it ends at the great sea, towards the occident it ends at [[Mare Nostrum|our sea]], and towards the north ("[[septentrional|septentrion]]") it ends in the [[Maeotian marshes]] and the river named ''[[Tanais|Thanaus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Asie est l'une des trois parties du monde que les auteurs divisent en Asie, Afrique et Europe. Asie se extend devers orient jusques a souleil&lt;!--souliel in original: the spelling has been carefully proofread--&gt; [[levant]], devers midi elle fine a la grant mer devers occident elle fine a notre mer, et devers septentrion elle fine aux paluz Meotides et au fleuve appellé Thanaus''; Laurent de Premierfait's expanded translation of [[Boccaccio]]'s ''[[De Casibus Virorum Illustrium]]'' (1409), quoted in Patricia M. Gathercole, "Laurent de Premierfait: The Translator of Boccaccio's De casibus virorum illustrium" ''The French Review'' '''27'''.4 (February 1954:245-252) p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:EuropaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|left|100px|''Europa:'' woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia'' 1603]]

==A fourth corner: the enlarged world==
For Laurent's French readers, Asia ended at "our sea", the [[Mediterranean]]; Europeans were only dimly aware of the [[Ural Mountains]], which divide Europe from Asia in the eyes of the modern geographer, and which represent the geological suture between two fragmentary continents, or [[craton]]s. Instead, the division between these continents in the European-centered picture was the [[Hellespont]], which neatly separated Europe from Asia. From the European perspective, into the [[Age of Discovery]], Asia began beyond the Hellespont with [[Asia Minor]], where the Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] had lain, and stretched away to unimaginably exotic and distant places&amp;mdash; "the [[Orient]]".

In the sixteenth century [[Americas|America]] too was full of exotic promise: the "[[New World]]".&lt;ref&gt;This theme is extensively explored in Hugh Honour, ''The New Golden Land: European Images of America from the Discoveries to the Present'' (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1603, [[Cesare Ripa]] published a book of emblems for the use of artists and artisans who might be called upon to depict allegorical figures. He covered an astonishingly wide variety of fields, and his work was reprinted many times. It was still being brought up-to-date in the 18th century. The illustrations reveal fixed Eurocentric perceptions of the nature of the "four corners of the world." Ripa's ''Europe'' (''illustration, left'') is the land of abundance (cornucopia) of kings and the pope, whose crowns and the papal tiara lie at her feet, and of cities.
[[Image:AsiaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|right|100px|''Asia:'' woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia,'' 1603]]
''Africa'', by contrast (''illustration, below right'') wears the elephant headdress (worn by rulers depicted on Hellenistic [[Bactria]]n coins) and is accompanied by a lion, the scorpion of the desert sands and [[Cleopatra]]'s [[asp (reptile)|asps]]. ''Asia'' (''illustration, right''), the seat of Religion, carries a smoking [[censer]] as a camel takes its ease.
[[Image:AmericaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|left|100px|''America'', woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia'' 1603]]
And the iconic image of ''America'' (''illustration, below left'') shows a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] maiden in a feathered headdress, with [[bow (weapon)|bow]] and arrow. Perhaps she represents a fabled [[Amazons|Amazon]] from the river that already carried the name.

The American millionaire philanthropist [[James Hazen Hyde]], who inherited a majority share in [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States|Equitable Life Assurance Society]], formed a collection of allegorical prints illustrating the Four Continents that are now at the [[New-York Historical Society]]; Hyde's drawings and a supporting collection of sets of porcelain table ornaments and other decorative arts illustrating the Four Continents were shared by various [[New York City]] museums.
[[Image:AfricaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|right|100px|''Africa'': woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia'' 1603]]

The Renaissance associated one major river to each of the continents.
The Four Rivers theme appears for example in the [[Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi]] in the [[Piazza Navona]] in Rome.

With the confirmed discovery that [[Australia]] was an island continent, the theme of the "Four Continents" lost much of its drive, long before a sixth continent, [[Antarctica]], was discovered. The iconography survived as the '''Four Corners of the World''', however, generally in self-consciously classicizing contexts: for instance, in New York, in front of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House]] (1907), four sculptural groups by [[Daniel Chester French]] symbolize the "Four Corners of the World."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8407">In [[mathematics]], specifically in the [[calculus of variations]], a variation {{math|''&amp;delta;f''}} of a function {{math|''f''}} can be concentrated on an arbitrarily small interval, but not a single point.
Accordingly, the necessary condition of extremum ([[functional derivative]] equal zero) appears in a [[weak formulation]] (variational form) integrated with an arbitrary function {{math|''&amp;delta;f''}}. The '''fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations''' is typically used to transform this weak formulation into the strong formulation ([[differential equation]]), free of the integration with arbitrary function. The proof usually exploits the possibility to choose {{math|''&amp;delta;f''}} concentrated on an interval on which {{math|''f''}} keeps sign (positive or negative). Several versions of the lemma are in use. Basic versions are easy to formulate and prove. More powerful versions are used when needed.

==Basic version==

:If a continuous function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on an open interval &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the equality
::&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b f(x)h(x)\,\operatorname{d}x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:for all [[compactly supported]] [[smooth function]]s &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is identically zero.&lt;ref name=J1&gt;{{harvnb|Jost|Li-Jost|1998|loc=Lemma 1.1.1 on p.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GF1&gt;{{harvnb|Gelfand|Fomin|1963|loc=Lemma 1 on p.9 (and Remark)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here "smooth" may be interpreted as "infinitely differentiable",&lt;ref name=J1 /&gt; but often is interpreted as "twice continuously differentiable" or "continuously differentiable" or even just "continuous",&lt;ref name=GF1 /&gt; since these weaker statements may be strong enough for a given task. "Compactly supported" means "vanishes outside &lt;math&gt;(c,d)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;c&lt;d&lt;b&lt;/math&gt;";&lt;ref name=J1 /&gt; but often a weaker statement suffices, assuming only that &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and a number of its derivatives) vanishes at the endpoints &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;;&lt;ref name=GF1 /&gt; in this case the closed interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; is used.

==Version for two given functions==

:If a pair of continuous functions ''f'', ''g'' on an interval (''a'',''b'') satisfies the equality
::&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b ( f(x) \, h(x) + g(x) \, h'(x) ) \, \mathrm{d}x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:for all compactly supported smooth functions ''h'' on (''a'',''b''), then ''g'' is differentiable, and ''g''' = ''f'' &amp;nbsp;everywhere.&lt;ref name=GF4&gt;{{harvnb|Gelfand|Fomin|1963|loc=Lemma 4 on p.11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=H1&gt;{{harvnb|Hestenes|1966|loc=Lemma 15.1 on p.50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The special case for ''g'' = 0 is just the basic version.

Here is the special case for ''f'' = 0 (often sufficient).

:If a continuous function ''g'' on an interval (''a'',''b'') satisfies the equality
::&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b g(x) \, h'(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:for all compactly supported smooth functions ''h'' on (''a'',''b''), then ''g'' is [[Constant function|constant]].&lt;ref name=GF2&gt;{{harvnb|Gelfand|Fomin|1963|loc=Lemma 2 on p.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If, in addition, [[continuously differentiable|continuous differentiability]] of ''g'' is assumed, then [[integration by parts]] reduces both statements to the basic version; this case is attributed to [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], while the proof of differentiability of ''g'' is due to [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]].

==Versions for discontinuous functions==

The given functions (''f'', ''g'') may be discontinuous, provided that they are [[locally integrable]] (on the given interval). In this case, [[Lebesgue integration]] is meant, the conclusions hold [[almost everywhere]] (thus, in all continuity points), and differentiability of ''g'' is interpreted as local [[absolute continuity]] (rather than continuous differentiability).&lt;ref name=J2&gt;{{harvnb|Jost|Li-Jost|1998|loc=Lemma 1.2.1 on p.13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gia&gt;{{harvnb|Giaquinta|Hildebrandt|1996|loc=section 2.3: Mollifiers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the given functions are assumed to be [[piecewise continuous]], in which case [[Riemann integration]] suffices, and the conclusions are stated everywhere except the finite set of discontinuity points.&lt;ref name=H1 /&gt;

==Higher derivatives==

:If a tuple of continuous functions &lt;math&gt;f_0,f_1,\dots,f_n&lt;/math&gt; on an interval (''a'',''b'') satisfies the equality
::&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b ( f_0(x) \, h(x) + f_1(x) \, h'(x) + \dots + f_n(x) \, h^{(n)}(x) ) \, \mathrm{d}x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:for all compactly supported smooth functions ''h'' on (''a'',''b''), then there exist continuously differentiable functions &lt;math&gt; u_0,u_1,\dots,u_{n-1} &lt;/math&gt; on (''a'',''b'') such that
::&lt;math&gt; f_0 = u'_0, \; f_1 = u_0+u'_1, \; \dots, \; f_{n-1}=u_{n-2}+u'_{n-1}, \; f_n = u_{n-1} &lt;/math&gt;
:everywhere.&lt;ref name=H2&gt;{{harvnb|Hestenes|1966|loc=Lemma 13.1 on p.105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This necessary condition is also sufficient, since the integrand becomes &lt;math&gt; (u_0 h)' + (u_1 h')' + \dots + (u_{n-1} h^{(n-1)})'. &lt;/math&gt;

The case ''n'' = 1 is just the version for two given functions, since &lt;math&gt; f=f_0=u'_0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f_1=u_0, &lt;/math&gt; thus, &lt;math&gt; f_0-f'_1 = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

In contrast, the case ''n''=2 does not lead to the relation &lt;math&gt; f_0 - f'_1 + f''_2 = 0, &lt;/math&gt; since the function &lt;math&gt; f_2 = u_1 &lt;/math&gt; need not be differentiable twice. The sufficient condition &lt;math&gt; f_0 - f'_1 + f''_2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt; is not necessary. Rather, the necessary and sufficient condition may be written as &lt;math&gt; f_0 - (f_1 - f'_2)' = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for ''n''=2, &lt;math&gt; f_0 - (f_1 - (f_2-f'_3)')' = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for ''n''=3, and so on; in general, the brackets cannot be opened because of non-differentiability.

==Vector-valued functions==

Generalization to [[vector-valued functions]] &lt;math&gt;(a,b)\to\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; is straightforward; one applies the results for scalar functions to each coordinate separately,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gelfand|Fomin|1963|loc=p.35}}&lt;/ref&gt; or treats the vector-valued case from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jost|Li-Jost|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multivariable functions==

:If a continuous [[Function of several real variables|multivariable function]] ''f'' on an open set &lt;math&gt;\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the equality
::&lt;math&gt; \int_\Omega f(x) \, h(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:for all compactly supported smooth functions ''h'' on Ω, then ''f'' is identically zero.

Similarly to the basic version, one may consider a continuous function ''f'' on the closure of Ω, assuming that ''h'' vanishes on the boundary of Ω (rather than compactly supported).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gelfand|Fomin|1963|loc=Lemma on p.22}}; the proof applies in both situations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here is a version for discontinuous multivariable functions.

:Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; be an open set, and &lt;math&gt;f\in L^2(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the equality
::&lt;math&gt; \int_\Omega f(x) \, h(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:for all compactly supported smooth functions ''h'' on Ω. Then ''f''=0 (in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, that is, almost everywhere).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jost|Li-Jost|1998|loc=Lemma 3.2.3 on p.170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
This lemma is used to prove that [[maxima and minima|extrema]] of the [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]
:&lt;math&gt; J[y] = \int_{x_0}^{x_1} L(t,y(t),\dot y(t)) \, \mathrm{d}t &lt;/math&gt;
are  [[weak solution]]s &lt;math&gt;y:[x_0,x_1]\to V&lt;/math&gt; (for an appropriate vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;) of the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]
:&lt;math&gt; {\partial L(t,y(t),\dot y(t)) \over \partial y} = {\mathrm{d} \over \mathrm{d}t} {\partial L(t,y(t),\dot y(t)) \over \partial \dot y} .&lt;/math&gt;
The Euler–Lagrange equation plays a prominent role in [[classical mechanics]] and [[differential geometry]].

'''Global Peace System''' is a concept of global [[conflict resolution]] dependent on nonviolent processes to eradicate war. It relies upon a multi-strand approach to conflict resolution, incorporating broad social and political solutions. In contemporary [[peace and conflict studies]], the concept of a global peace system has been evolving since the 1940s around the theory that there is a global infrastructure of peacebuilding and that there is a need for [[systems thinking]] in peacebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;See Zelizer 2013 and Ricigliano 2013; peacebuilding here is considered as integrated efforts in numerous sectors ranging from humanitarian relief to international development (Zelizer, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "global peace system" was coined from the work of Robert Johansen, who explored the concept in 1978's ''Toward a Dependable Place''.&lt;ref name=Mc2007&gt;McElwee 2007, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and evolution ==
An early use of the term “peace system” occurred in Kirby Page’s book ''National Defense'' (1931).&lt;ref&gt; See p. vi (paragraph 4) and pp. 348, 357; p. vi, "Confronted with an ominous world situation, shall we seek security in increased armaments or shall we put our reliance in a peace system?" The book ends (p. 357) by calling on "the individual citizen . . . to dedicate himself to the task of strengthening the peace system." &lt;/ref&gt; In a 1943 pamphlet and a 1966 book, political theorist David Mitrany stated that the prevention of wars required the creation of a peace system which he outlined.&lt;ref&gt;Mitrany 1966&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978's ''Toward a Dependable Place'', Johansen coined the term "global peace system",&lt;ref name=Mc2007/&gt; arguing that, contrary to the advocated and perceived military security in the international system, the peace system provides greater justice, economic well-being and ecological security. In a global peace system, according to Johansen, "conflict is resolved through nonviolent, political, social, and judicial processes. There are no expectations of war and no national military arsenals."&lt;ref&gt;Johansen 1978 p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Johansen called for the creation of such a system by a people’s movement.

In 1988, Robert A. Irwin stated that a peace system involves multiple war prevention layers: first, global reforms which reduce the causes of war involve non-threatening defense-policies as well as political, economic, ecological and cultural change; second, conflict resolution mechanisms on the local, regional, national and global level.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Louise Diamond and John W. McDonald authored ''Multi-track Diplomacy: a Systems Approach to Peace'', wherein they identified nine specific tracks to produce a synergy in peacebuilding: public opinion and communication, government, professional conflict resolution, business, private citizens, activism, religion, funding, and research, training and education.&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Multi-track Diplomacy "Building Peace"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diamond and McDonald 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the pair founded the United States-based non-profit organization [[Institute for Multi-track Diplomacy]] with the mission of putting into practice their systems-based approach to peacebuilding.&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Multi-track Diplomacy "Mission"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003's ''Instead of War: the Urgency and Promise of the Global Peace System'', Timothy McElwee emphasizes three major focal areas in the construction of a global peace system: (1) strengthening international norms and institutions against war; (2) eliminating the conditions that give rise to war and violence; (3) supporting and encouraging alternative means of international conflict transformation.&lt;ref&gt;McElwee 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Other sector-based approaches to peacebuilding link international development, humanitarian assistance, gender, the private sector, religion, environmental change, security, media, health and the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;Zelizer 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Kent Shifferd proposed that there is a good chance to outlaw war within the next 100 years. Examining the history of peace, Shifferd posits that there has been more peace than war in history and numerous peace movements were active even during war times. Referring to the global peace system, Shifferd states that most of what needs to be invented to end war has been invented.&lt;ref&gt;Shifferd 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Ricigliano in 2012 stated that "while...difficult to ascribe specific causation to any one group, the positive trends … indicate that the international community, practitioners, and academics have learned important lessons about ending wars and building peace.”&lt;ref&gt;Ricigliano 2012, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2013, Douglas Fry noted that the creation of a global peace system involves synergistic elements such as a transformative vision that a peace-based global system is possible, the understanding of [[interdependence]] and [[cooperation]], an added level of [[Social identity theory|social identity]] including all human beings, the creation of effective and democratic procedures of international adjudication, and peace-supporting symbols and values.&lt;ref&gt;Fry 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2003, peace ethologist [[Judith Hand]] approached the subject of a paradigm shift to a global peace system from biological, behavioral, anthropological, and gender perspectives.&lt;ref name = "WBP"&gt;2003 ''Women, Power, and the Biology of Peace''. San Diego, CA : Questpath Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "TAW"&gt;2010 Hand, Judith L. "To Abolish War." ''Journal of Aggression, Conflict, and Peace Research'' 2(4): 44-56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "SHIFT"&gt;2014 ''Shift: The Beginning of War, The Ending of War''. San Diego, CA : Questpath Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = WSHD&gt;2018 ''War and Sex and Human Destiny''. San Diego, CA: Questpath Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;. Based on the biological principles of [[sexual dimorphism]] and [[parental investment]] theory and the political principle of [[gender parity]] in government (which she termed koinoniarchy) she argued that gender parity in governing is a necessary condition, not an option, for establishment and maintenance of a global peace system.&lt;ref&gt;Hand 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Buddhism and China}}
The '''Huayan''' or '''Flower Garland''' school of [[Buddhism]] ({{cjkv|t=華嚴|p=Huáyán}}, from {{lang-sa|script=Latn|Avataṃsaka}}) is a tradition of [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhist philosophy]] that first flourished in [[China]] during the [[Tang dynasty]]. The Huayen worldview is based primarily on the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra]]'' ({{zh|t=華嚴經|p=Huáyán jīng}}). The name ''Flower Garland'' is meant to suggest the crowning glory of a Buddha's profound understanding of ultimate reality.

The Huayan School is known as [[Hwaeom]] in [[Korea]] and [[Kegon]] in [[Japan]]. This tradition also had a strong influence on [[Chan Buddhism]].

==Origins and development==
[[Image:Datong Huayan Si 2013.08.29 09-37-05.jpg|thumb|220px|Aerial view of Huayan temple, [[Datong]]]]

===Origins===
The earliest texts associated with the Avatamsaka sutra are the ''Dousha jing'' (Taisho 280), produced by [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]] in the latter part of the second century CE and the ''Pusa benye jing'' (T. 281), translated by Zhi Qian in the early to mid third century. There is evidence that these small Buddhavatamsaka sutras circulated on their own as individual scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 110.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The translation of the large Avatamsaka sutra is often dated to the [[Northern and Southern dynasties|Southern Dynasties]] (420-589) when a translation team led by Gandharan master, Buddhabhadra worked on the sutra. There is also evidence of this sutra tradition in the [[Northern and Southern dynasties|Northern Dynasties]] (386-581) where a certain  Xuangao (402-444) taught the ''Huayan samadhi''.&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 169.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Patriarchs===
The founding of the school is traditionally attributed to a series of five "patriarchs" who were instrumental in developing the schools' doctrines. These five are:{{sfn|Cook|1977|p=24}}{{sfn|Imre|2007|p=5}}
#[[Dushun]] ({{zh|t=杜順|w=Tu-Shun}}), responsible for the establishment of Huayan studies as a distinct field;
#[[Zhiyan]] ({{zh|t=智儼|w=Chih-yen}}), considered to have established the basic doctrines of the sect;
#[[Fazang]] ({{zh|t=法藏|w=Fa-tsang}}), considered to have rationalized the doctrine for greater acceptance by society;
#[[Chengguan (monk)|Chengguan]] ({{zh|t=澄觀|w=Ch'eng-kuan}}), together with Zongmi, are understood to have further developed and transformed the teachings
#[[Guifeng Zongmi]] ({{zh|t=圭峰宗密|w=Kuei-feng Tsung-mi}}), who is simultaneous a patriarch of the [[Chinese Chán]] tradition and who also incorporated Taoist and Confucian teachings.

The five monks later honored as Huayan patriarchs were erudite scholar-practitioners who connected Buddhism with Chinese traditional culture closely, creating a Buddhist historical trend in developing multiple facets while the tradition’s essence remained the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Guo Cheen |last=Chengguan |title=Translating Totality in Parts: Chengguan's commentaries and subcommentaries to the Avatamska Sutra |date=2014 |publisher=University Press of America |location=Lanham, Maryland |isbn=978-0761863090 |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=de&amp;lr=&amp;id=M8M0AwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR3&amp;dq=Chengguan+huayan&amp;ots=aQzCrGBkJF&amp;sig=Z4PXaQhAC0a5yBKRp3ZwGqEToKs#v=onepage&amp;q=Chengguan%20huayan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on their writings, exegeses, and oral teachings, these men each played a significant and distinct role in the development of the school, although there are certain aspects of this patriarchal scheme which are clearly contrived. For example, Chengguan was born 26 years after Fazang's death. According to Robert Gimello's dissertation on Chih-Yen (1976), "most if not all of the major themes of Huayen thought" can be found in the works of the second patriarch Chih-yen, particularly the classification of scriptures and theories on the Dharmadhatu. Thus he names the patriarch Chih-yen (602-668) as the crucial figure in the foundation of Huayan.&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition reached the height of its influence under Fazang, who was the Buddhist teacher of the [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu Zetian]] (684–705).{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=15}}

Another important figure in the development and popularization of Huayan thought was the lay scholar [[Li Tongxuan]] ({{zh|t=李通玄}}, 635?-730), the author of the ''Huáyán lùn'' ({{zh|t=華嚴論}}), a popular and lengthy commentary on the Avatamsaka sutra. Fazang's disciple Huiyuan (673-743) also wrote a commentary on the Avatamsaka.&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page XV.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some accounts of the school also like to extend its patriarch-ship earlier to {{IAST|[[Aśvaghoṣa]]}} and [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]].

===Stagnation===
After the time of Zongmi and Li Tongxuan the Chinese school of Huayan generally stagnated in terms of new development, and then eventually began to decline. The school, which had been dependent upon the support it received from the government, suffered severely during the Buddhist purge of 841-845, initiated by [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang]], never to recover its former strength. Nonetheless, its profound metaphysics, such as that of the [[Four Dharmadhātu]] ({{zh|t=四法界}}) of interpenetration, had a deep impact on surviving East Asian schools.

==Texts==
[[Image:Goryeo-Avatamsaka Sutra.vo.12-mid.14c.Leeum.Museum.jpg|thumb|220px|Avatamsaka Sutra, vol. 12, frontispiece in gold and silver text on indigo blue paper, mid 14th century]]
===''Avataṃsaka Sūtra''===
The Huayan school's worldview was based primarily on the content of what it considered to be the supreme Buddhist revelation, the ''[[Avataṃsaka Sūtra]]''. The ''Avataṃsaka Sūtra'' is a compilation of sutras of various length. The earliest of these texts, the ''[[Ten Stages Sutra]]'', maybe dates from the first century CE.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=46}} The Daśabhūmika Sūtra describes the ten stages on the [[Bodhisattva]]-path. The various sutras were probably joined together shortly before its translation into Chinese, at the beginning of the 5th century CE.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=46}}

The ''Avataṃsaka Sūtra'' integrates the teachings on [[śūnyatā]] and Yogacara thinking.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=46}}

The basic idea of the ''Avataṃsaka Sūtra'' is the unity of the absolute and the relative:
{{quote|All in One, One in All. The All melts into a single whole. There are no divisions in the totality of reality [...] [I]t views the cosmos as holy, as "one bright pearl," the universal reality of the Buddha. The [[Dharmakāya|universal Buddhahood]] of all reality is the religious message of the Avatamsaka-sutra.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=46-47}}}}

Each part of the world reflects the totality of the cosmos:
{{quote|In each dust-mote of these worlds&lt;br&gt;
Are countless worlds and Buddhas...&lt;br&gt;
From the tip of each hair of Buddha's body&lt;br&gt;
Are revealed the indescribable Pure Lands...&lt;br&gt;
The indescribable infinite Lands&lt;br&gt;
All ensemble in a hair's tip [of Buddha].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=47}}}}
All levels of reality are related and interpenetrated. This is depicted in the image of [[Indra's net]]. This "unity in totality allows every individual entity of the phenomenal world its uniqueness without attributing an [[Buddha-nature|inherent nature]] to anything".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=47}}

===Other texts===
Other Mahayana texts such as the ''[[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana]]'' (''Dasheng Qixin Lun'' 大乘起信論),  which was a condensation of Chinese thought on awakening and ultimate reality, influenced Huayan masters like Fazang and Zongmi, who both wrote commentaries on the text.{{sfn|Lai|2003}} The [[Lotus sutra]] was also seen as an important text in this school, though not as important as the Avatamsaka. The [[Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment]] was particularly important for Zongmi.

The Huayen patriarchs wrote numerous commentaries and original treatises on the Mahayana sutras and Huayen philosophy. Fazang for example, wrote commentaries on the Avatamsaka, the [[Lankavatara Sutra]] and the Awakening of Faith.&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 199.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the key Huayen treatises is ''On the Meditation of the Dharmadhātu'' attributed to the first patriarch [[Dushun]].{{sfn|Chang|1992|p=207}}

Another is [[Fazang]]’s ''Treatise on the Golden Lion'' which is said to have been written to explain Huayen's view of interpenetration to [[Empress Wu]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd edition, 2009, page 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and practice==
[[File:Indrasnet.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 3D rendering of Indra's net.]]

Huayan thought is mainly focused on explaining the nature of the [[Dharmadhatu]], the world as it is ultimately, from the point of view of a fully awakened being. It is often said to be the philosophical articulation of Chan meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd edition, 2009, page 139.&lt;/ref&gt; It it influenced by the Avatamsaka and Buddha nature literature as well as by the Chinese Yogacara and Madhyamaka schools. Patriarchs of the school such as Zongmi were also influenced by Chinese philosophy, particularly the classics of [[Taoism]].&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;Fox, Alan. The Practice of Huayan Buddhism, http://www.fgu.edu.tw/~cbs/pdf/2013%E8%AB%96%E6%96%87%E9%9B%86/q16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpenetration=== 
{{anchor|Interpenetration}} &lt;!-- Anchor for [[Interpenetration (Buddhism)]] from dab page: Interpenetration --&gt;
A key doctrine of Huayan is the mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena (''dharmas'') or "perfect interfusion" (''yuanrong'', 圓融). This is associated with what the Huayan sees as its unique contribution, the "[[dharmadhatu]] [[pratityasamutpada]]". This is described by Wei Daoru as the idea that "countless dharmas (all phenomena in the world) are representations of the wisdom of Buddha without exception" and that "they exist in a state of mutual dependence, interfusion and balance without any contradiction or conflict. This thought essentially argues that there is no relationship of cause and result among phenomena and that things are not formed sequentially. Instead, they constitute the world by the mutual interfusion of complete equality."&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 189.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to this theory, any phenomenon exists only as part of the total nexus of reality, its existence depends on the total network of all other things, which are all equally connected to each other and contained in each other.&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 189.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The Huayan patriarchs used various metaphors to express this, such as [[Indra's net]], a hall of mirrors and the world text. To illustrate the doctrine to [[Empress Wu]], the patriarch Fazang:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"called for a candle and placed it surrounded by mirrors on every side. When lit, the candle was reflected in each mirror, and each of the reflections in every other mirror so that in any one mirror were the images of all the others."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd edition, 2009, page 140.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This Buddhist doctrine also includes the views that:&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 190-93.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Practicing one teaching is practicing all teachings" 
*Ending one mental defilement is ending all of them
* Truth (or reality) is understood as encompassing and interpenetrating falsehood (or illusion), and vice versa
* Good is understood as encompassing and interpenetrating evil
* Similarly, all mind-made distinctions are understood as "collapsing" in the [[Śūnyatā|enlightened understanding of emptiness]] (a [[Madhyamaka|tradition]] traced back to the Buddhist philosopher [[Nagarjuna]])

===Li and Shi===
Another important distinction used by Huayan patriarchs is that of ''li'' and ''shi'', noumenon and phenomenon which was explained using the metaphor of gold and lions, or water and waves. According to Paul Williams:

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, noumenon and phenomena mutually interpenetrate and are (in a sense) identical. There is no opposition between the two. The one does not cancel out the other. Second, Fazang explains elsewhere that since all things arise interdependently (following Madhyamika), and since the links of interdependence expand throughout the entire universe and at all time (past, present, and future depend upon each other, which is to say the total dharmadhatu arises simultaneously), so in the totality of interdependence, the dharmadhatu, all phenomena are mutually interpenetrating and identical.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd edition, 2009, page 143.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Fourfold Dharmadhatu and meditation===
The theory of the Fourfold Dharmadhatu (''sifajie'', 四法界) is explained in the "Meditative Perspectives on the Huayan Dharmadhatu" (''Huayan Fajie Guanmen'', 華嚴法界觀門) and its commentaries.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is the central meditative framework for the Huayan tradition. Another key text is the  "Cessation and Contemplation in the Five Teachings of Huayan" (''Huayan wujiao zhiguan'' 華嚴五教止觀).&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Dharmadhatu is the goal of the bodhisattva's practice, the ultimate nature of reality which must be known or entered into (''ru'', 入). According to Fox, the Fourfold Dharmadhatu is "four cognitive approaches to the world, four ways of apprehending reality".The four ways of seeing reality are:&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; {{sfn|Garfield|2011|p=76}}

# All dharmas are seen as particular separate events or phenomena (shi 事). This is the mundane way of seeing.
# All events are an expression of ''li'' (理, the absolute, principle or noumenon), which is associated with the concepts of [[shunyata]],  “One Mind” (''yi xin'' 一心) and [[Buddha nature]]
# Shi and Li interpenetrate (''lishi wuai'' 理事無礙)
# All events interpenetrate (''shishi wuai'' 事事無礙), "all distinct phenomenal dharmas interfuse and penetrate in all ways" ([[Zongmi]]).

The three levels of Huayan meditation on the Dharmadhatu correspond to the last three views of the Dharmadhatu are:&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

#Meditation on “True Emptiness” 
#Illuminating the non-obstruction of principle and phenomena.
#Meditation on “universal pervasion and complete accommodation.”

According to Fox, "these dharmadhatus are not separate worlds – they are actually increasingly more holographic perspectives on a single phenomenological manifold...they more properly represent four types or orders of perspectives on experience."&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore for Huayan this practice is the solution to the problem of samsara which lies in the "fixation or attachment to a particular perspective. What we think are the essences of objects are really therefore nothing but mere names, mere functional designations, and none of these contextual definitions need necessarily interfere with any of the others."&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other practices===
According to Paul Williams, the reading and recitation of the Avatamsaka sutra was also a central practice for the tradition, for monks and laity.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd edition, 2009, page 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another practice which is highlighted in the Avatamsaka sutra is that of [[Buddhānusmṛti]] or ''nianfo''- mindfulness of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 224&lt;/ref&gt; 

The tradition also mentions two key [[samadhi]]s, the ocean-seal samadhi (Ch. ''haiyin sanmei'') and the huayan samadhi (''huayan sanmei'').&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 226-227&lt;/ref&gt; 

Layman Li Tongxuan developed a unique meditative practice based on the 9th chapter of the Avatamsaka sutra. The practice, named 'the contemplation of Buddhalight' (''joguang guan''), focused on tracing the universal light which is radiated by the Buddha in one's mind and expanding it further outwards.&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 228.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
===Sudden enlightenment===
Huayan favored the teaching of sudden enlightenment. This is because the Buddha nature is already present in all sentient beings and also because their theory of interpenetration entails that Buddhahood is already present at the first stage of a Bodhisattva's path.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd edition, 2009, page 144.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Li Tongxuan:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he first access of faith in the mind of the practitioner is in itself the culmination of the entire path, the very realization of final Buddhahood.... ‘Faith’ or confidence in the possibility of enlightenment is nothing but enlightenment itself, in an ''anticipatory and causative modality''.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd edition, 2009, page 144-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Buddhahood was seen as beyond language and stages of practice. Because practices cannot create something that is already not imminent, they were seen as simply revealing what was already there. The patriarch Zongmi formulated his own theory of awakening which was "immediate awakening followed by gradual cultivation" and the view that "immediate and gradual are not only not contradictory, but are actually complementary".&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paradox===
Huayan makes extensive use of [[paradox]] in argument and literary imagery. All three types of paradox originate in the tension between [[two truths doctrine|conventional and absolute truth]]. Huayan uses three types of paradox:
1. Emphasizing the concept of śūnyatā, first is asserted that a phenomenon X is empty, which implies that X is not X. An example from Fazang is the assertion:{{quote|[W]hen one understands that origination is without self-nature, then there is no origination.{{sfn|Wright|1982}}}}
2. Reversing the first paradox by asserting that any empty phenomenon is an expression of the absolute non-duality between emptiness and form, or the identity between conditioned, relative reality and the ultimate truth of [[tathatā]]. 
This paradox is derived from two doctrinal sources: 
* The Hua-yen concept of "true emptiness" 
* The Hua-yen interpretation of the dialectic of the One Mind in the ''[[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana]]''.
Fazang's paradoxical assertion illustrates this second type:
{{quote|When the great wisdom of perfect clarity gazes upon a minute hair, the universal sea of nature, the true source, is clearly manifest.{{sfn|Wright|1982}}}}
3. The third variation of paradox is grounded in the Hua-yen doctrine of the "nonobstruction of all phenomena" (shih shih wu-ai(k)). Each phenomenon is perceived as interpenetrating with and containing all others. This paradoxical violation of the conventional order of time and space is exemplified by Fa-tsang's famous "Essay on the Golden Lion":{{quote|In each and every hair [of the lion] there is the golden lion. All of the lions contained in each and every hair simultaneously and suddenly penetrate into one hair. [Therefore], within each and every hair there are unlimited lions.{{sfn|Wright|1982}}}}

==Classification of Buddhist teachings==
Buddhism was introduced into China in bits and pieces. When the knowledge of Buddhism grew larger, various schools attempted to get a grip on the Buddhist tradition by developing classifications of teachings,{{sfn|Lai|2003}} such as the [[Tiantai#Five Periods and Eight Teachings|Five Periods and Eight Teachings]] of the [[Tiantai|Tiantai-school]].

The Hua-yen school developed a fivefold classification:{{sfn|Buswell|1993|p=233}}
# The [[Hinayana|Hinayana-teachings]], especially the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvastivadins]]
# The [[Mahayana|Mahayana-teachings]], including [[Yogacara]], [[Madhyamaka]]
# The "Final Teachings", based on the [[Tathagatagarbha|Tathagatagarbha-teachings]], especially the [[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana|Awakening of Faith]]
# The [[Subitism|Sudden Teaching]], "which 'revealed' (''hsien'') rather than verbalised the teaching"{{sfn|Buswell|1993|p=233}}
# The Complete, or Perfect, Teachings of the Avatamsaka-sutra and the Hua-yen school.

Huayan and [[Zen|Chán]] had doctrinal arguments regarding which would be the correct concept of sudden awakening. The teachings of the Chán-school were regarded as inferior by the Hua-yen teachers. The Chán-school polemitized against this classification, by devising its own rhetorics in defense.{{sfn|Buswell|1993}}

==Influence==
The doctrines of the Huayan school ended up having profound impact on the philosophical attitudes of [[East Asian Buddhism]]. According to Wei Daoru their theory of perfect interfusion was "gradually accepted by all Buddhist traditions and it eventually permeated all aspects of Chinese Buddhism."&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 189.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Chinese Chán]] was profoundly influenced by it, though Chán also defined itself by distinguishing itself from Huayan.{{sfn|Buswell|1993}} [[Guifeng Zongmi|Tsung-mi]], the Fifth Patriarch of the Hua-yen school, also occupies a prominent position in the history of Chán. During the Song, the Hua-yen metaphysics were completely assimilated by the Chán-school.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=48}}

The '''Human Brain Project''' ('''HBP''') is a large ten-year scientific research project, based on [[Exascale computing|exascale supercomputers]], that aims to build a collaborative [[Information and communications technology|ICT]]-based scientific research infrastructure to allow researchers across Europe to advance knowledge in the fields of neuroscience, computing, and brain-related medicine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Human Brain Project, Framework Partnership Agreement https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/documents/10180/538356/FPA++Annex+1+Part+B/41c4da2e-0e69-4295-8e98-3484677d661f&lt;/ref&gt; The Project, which started on 1 October 2013, is a [[European Commission]]  [[Future and Emerging Technologies]] Flagship. The HBP is coordinated by the [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]] and is largely funded by the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/fet-flagships&lt;/ref&gt; The project coordination office is in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Human Brain Project relocates to Geneva|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/science_technology/Human_Brain_Project_relocates_to_Geneva.html?cid=37219978|accessdate=29 October 2013|newspaper=SwissInfo|date=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic goals and organisation==
[[File:Rolex Learning center.jpg|thumb|The 2013 HBP Summit–the inauguration of the Project–took place in the [[EPFL Learning Centre]] in October 2013. It brought together scientists from over 100 Partner Institutions.]]

Fundamental to the HBP approach is to investigate the brain on different spatial and temporal scales (i.e. from the molecular to the large networks underlying higher cognitive processes, and from milliseconds to years). To achieve this goal, the HBP relies on the collaboration of scientists from diverse disciplines, including neuroscience, philosophy and computer science, to take advantage of the loop of experimental data, modelling theories and simulations. The idea is that empirical results are used to develop theories, which then foster modelling and simulations which result in predictions that are in turn verified by empirical results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2016.10.046 |pmid=27809997 |title=The Human Brain Project: Creating a European Research Infrastructure to Decode the Human Brain |journal=Neuron |volume=92 |issue=3 |pages=574–581 |year=2016 |last1=Amunts |first1=Katrin |last2=Ebell |first2=Christoph |last3=Muller |first3=Jeff |last4=Telefont |first4=Martin |last5=Knoll |first5=Alois |last6=Lippert |first6=Thomas }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary objective of the HBP is to create an ICT-based research infrastructure for brain research, cognitive neuroscience and brain-inspired computing, which can be used by researchers world-wide.

The Project is divided into 12 Subprojects. Six of these develop ICT-based platforms (Subprojects 5-10), which consist of prototype hardware, software, databases, and programming interfaces. These tools are available to researchers worldwide via the HBP [[Collaboratory]]. Three Subprojects gather data on empirical neuroscience and establish theoretical foundations (Subprojects 1-4) and one is responsible for ethics and society (Subproject 12). Subproject 11 coordinates the project.

* SP7 [[High-performance computing|High-performance Analytics and Computing]] Platform: Providing the ICT capability to map the brain in unprecedented detail, construct complex models, run large simulations, and analyse large volumes of data
* SP8 [[Medical informatics|Medical Informatics]] Platform: Developing the infrastructure to share hospital and medical research data for the purpose of understanding disease clusters and their respective disease signatures
* SP9 [[Neuromorphic engineering|Neuromorphic Computing]] Platform: Developing and applying brain-inspired computing technology
* SP10 [[Neurorobotics]] Platform: Developing virtual and real robots and environments for testing brain simulations
* SP11 Management and Coordination: General coordination of the project
* SP12 Ethics and Society: Exploring the ethical and societal impact of HBP’s work

The HBP is coordinated by the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne and involves researchers from over 117 partner institutions in 19 countries across Europe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Notable Partner Institutions include the [[University of Heidelberg]], [[Forschungszentrum Jülich]], and the [[University Hospital of Lausanne]].

The scientific direction is provided by representatives from each of the HBP's Subprojects, which form the Science and Infrastructure Board (SIB). Katrin Amunts from Forschungszentrum Jülich is the Chair of the SIB. Alois Knoll from TU Munich is Vice Chair of the SIB for software. The Directorate steers the daily work of the HBP – it is led by Andreas Mortensen from EPFL. 

==Funding==
The HBP is funded by the European Commission Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT) under the Horizon 2020 framework, an EU Research and Innovation funding programme. It was one of the two initial Future Emerging Technologies (FET) Flagship projects.

The project is split into five phases, each supplied with separate funding. The call for funding for the Project's initial two-and-a-half-year 'Ramp-Up Phase' of  EUR 54 million closed in November 2013 and the results were announced in March 2014. Twenty-two projects from thirty-two organisations were selected for the initial funding of EUR 8.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Human Brain Project just got bigger |url=https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/documents/10180/538356/HBP+Competitive+Calls+Programme+-+Press+Release/e98a279e-6e08-4ad5-bd07-b125c9d63cd3?version=1.1 |accessdate=2014-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ramp-Up Phase ended on 31 March 2016. Funding is reassessed every two years using Specific Grant Agreements (SGA); the first of which began in April 2016 (ending in April 2018), and the second with a total EU funding of 88 Million Euro starting in April 2018 (ending in March 2020). The HBP's total costs are estimated at EUR 1.019 billion, of which EUR 500 million will be provided by the European Commission, EUR 500 million by national, public and private organisations, and EUR 19 million by the Core Project Ramp-Up Phase Partners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Obstacles==
One of the Project's primary hurdles is the unsystematic nature of the information collected from previous brain research. Neurological research data varies by biological organisation schemes, species studied, and by developmental stages, making it difficult to collectively use the data to replicate the brain in a model that acts as a single system.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;[http://tierra.aslab.upm.es/documents/projects/HBP_flagship_report_for_Europe.pdf "A Report to the European Commission" ] The Human Brain Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other obstacles include engineering problems involving power consumption, memory, and storage.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/discover/the-project/overview&lt;/ref&gt; For example, detailed neuron representations are very computationally expensive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/s12868-015-0162-6 |title=Simulation of alcohol action upon a detailed Purkinje neuron model and a simpler surrogate model that runs &gt;400 times faster |journal=BMC Neuroscience |volume=16 |year=2015 |last1=Forrest |first1=Michael D }}&lt;/ref&gt; and whole brain simulation is at the leading edge of our computational capability.

==Implications==
[[File:01337LOW HQ MERCK SERONO.jpg|thumb|The Human Brain Project moved to [[Campus Biotech]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/sci-tech/surprise-move_human-brain-project-relocates-to-geneva/37219978|title=Human Brain Project relocates to Geneva - SWI swissinfo.ch|website=SWI swissinfo.ch|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Technologies generated by the HBP and other similar projects offer several possibilities to other fields of research. For instance, a brain model can be used to investigate signatures of disease in the brain and the impact of certain drugs, enabling the development of better diagnosis and treatment methods. Ultimately, these technologies will likely lead to more advanced medical options available to patients at a lower cost.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;

In addition, detailed brain simulation requires significant computing power, leading to developments in supercomputing and energy-efficient, brain-inspired computing techniques. Computational developments can be extended into areas such as data mining, telecommunications, appliances, and other industrial uses.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;

The long-term ethical consequences of the Project are also considered. The Project follows a policy of Responsible Research and Innovation, and its Ethics Advisory Board is responsible for monitoring the use of human volunteers, animal subjects, and the data collected. Implications on European society, industry, and economy are investigated by the HBP Ethics and Society Programme's Foresight Lab.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/ethics-and-society Human Brain Project-Ethics and Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829141728/http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/ethics-and-society |date=29 August 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
An open letter was sent on 7 July 2014 to the European Commission by 154 European researchers (750 signatures as of 3 September 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/513027a |pmid=25186884 |title=Neuroscience: Where is the brain in the Human Brain Project? |journal=Nature |volume=513 |issue=7516 |pages=27–9 |year=2014 |last1=Frégnac |first1=Yves |last2=Laurent |first2=Gilles |bibcode=2014Natur.513...27F }}&lt;/ref&gt; complaining of the HBP's overly narrow approach, and threatening to boycott the Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open message to the European Commission concerning the Human Brain Project|url=http://www.neurofuture.eu/|accessdate=2014-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to this controversy was an internal dispute about funding for cognitive scientists who study high level brain functions, such as thought and behaviour. However, the HBP stated that there is “no question that cognition and behaviour are vital to the HBP”, explaining that cognitive neuroscience research was repositioned in the Project to allow the Core Project to focus on building the Platforms. In addition, The Open Letter called on the EC to “reallocate the funding currently allocated to the HBP core and partnering projects to broad neuroscience-directed funding to meet the original goals of the HBP—understanding brain function and its effect on society”. In its response, the HBP said that “while [neuroscience research] generates a vast amount of valuable data, there is currently no technology for sharing, organising, analysing or integrating this information, beyond papers and even databases. The HBP will provide the critical missing layer to move towards a multi-level reconstruction and simulation of the brain”. It added that “cognitive and behavioural neuroscience will become the most significant component of neuroscience in HBP over the course of the Project. However, for this to happen the Platforms have to be in place first”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/documents/10180/17646/HBP-Statement.090614.pdf|title=The Vital Role of Neuroscience in the Human Brain Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=11 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823003843/https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/documents/10180/17646/HBP-Statement.090614.pdf|archivedate=23 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Dayan]], director of computational neuroscience at [[University College London]], argued that the goal of a large-scale simulation of the brain is radically premature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientists threaten to boycott €1.2bn Human Brain Project|publisher=The Guardian|date=7 July 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/07/human-brain-project-researchers-threaten-boycott|accessdate=2014-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Geoffrey Hinton]] said that "[t]he real problem with that project is they have no clue how to get a large system like that to learn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brean |first=Joseph |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/blog.html?b=news.nationalpost.com/2014/07/08/a-billion-dollar-european-effort-to-model-the-human-brain-in-a-supercomputer-is-in-danger-of-collapsing |title=A billion-dollar European effort to model the brain in a supercomputer is in danger of collapsing |work=[[National Post]] |date=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concerns as to the project's methodology were raised by [[Robert Epstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer|title=Your brain does not process information and it is not a computer – Robert Epstein {{!}} Aeon Essays|website=Aeon|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HBP has said that its members share the uncertainty surrounding large-scale simulation, but that “reconstructing and simulating the human brain is a vision, a target; the benefits will come from the technology needed to get there. That technology, developed by the HBP, will benefit all of neuroscience as well as related fields”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2015 the project underwent a review process and the three-member executive committee, led by Markram, was dissolved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1015-36 |title=Trouble in Mind |journal=Scientific American |volume=313 |issue=4 |pages=36–42 |year=2015 |last1=Theil |first1=Stefan |bibcode=2015SciAm.313d..36T }}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced by a 22-member governing board.&lt;ref&gt;http://sciencebusiness.net/news/77294/%E2%82%AC1B-Human-Brain-Project-back-on-track-after-Commission-signs-new-contract{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "'''identifiable victim effect'''" refers to the tendency of individuals to offer greater aid when a specific, identifiable person ("victim") is observed under hardship, as compared to a large, vaguely defined group with the same need.&lt;ref name= "Jenni &amp; Loewenstein, 1997"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jenni|first=Karen|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|date=1997-05-01|title=Explaining the Identifiable Victim Effect|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007740225484|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|language=en|volume=14|issue=3|pages=235–257|doi=10.1023/A:1007740225484|issn=0895-5646}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is also observed when subjects administer [[punishment]] rather than reward. Research has shown that individuals can be more likely to mete out punishment, even at their own expense, when they are punishing specific, identifiable individuals ("perpetrators").&lt;ref name= "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Small|first=Deborah A.|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|date=2005-12-01|title=The devil you know: the effects of identifiability on punishment|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bdm.507/abstract|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|language=en|volume=18|issue=5|pages=311–318|doi=10.1002/bdm.507|issn=1099-0771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concrete images and representations are often more powerful sources of persuasion than are abstract statistics.&lt;ref name="Collins &amp; Taylor, 1988"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Rebecca L.|last2=Taylor|first2=Shelley E.|last3=Wood|first3=Joanne V.|last4=Thompson|first4=Suzanne C.|date=1988-01-01|title=The vividness effect: Elusive or illusory?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022103188900418|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(88)90041-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Ryan White]] contracted [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]] at age 13 and struggled with the disease until succumbing some six years later. Following his death, the US congress passed the [[Ryan White Care Act]], which funded the largest set of services for people living with the AIDS in the country.&lt;ref name= "Ryan"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhhr.wv.gov/oeps/std-hiv-hep/HIV_AIDS/caresupport/Pages/RyanWhiteCareAct.aspx|title=Ryan White and Care Act History|last=|first=|date=|website=dhhr.wv.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect is epitomized by the phrase (commonly attributed to [[Joseph Stalin]]) "A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic."&lt;ref&gt;http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/21/death-statistic/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The conceptualization of the identifiable victim effect as it is known today is commonly attributed to American economist [[Thomas Schelling]]. He wrote that harm to a particular person invokes “anxiety and sentiment, guilt and awe, responsibility and religion, [but]…most of this awesomeness disappears when we deal with statistical death”.&lt;ref name="Schelling, 1968"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schelling|first=Thomas, C|date=|year=1968|editor-last=Chase|title=The Life You Save May Be Your Own|url=|journal=Problems in public expenditure analysis (pp. 127–162). :|publisher=The Brookings Institution|volume=|pages=127–162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanations ==

=== ''Ex post'' vs ''ex ante'' evaluation ===

The decision to save an identifiable victim is made ''ex post'', meaning it is done ''after'' the victim is in danger. In contrast, the decision to save a statistical victim is often made ''ex ante'', as a pre-emptive measure to ''prevent'' the individual from being in danger.&lt;ref name="Weinstein, Shepard, &amp; Pliskin, 1980"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weinstein|first=M|last2=Shepard|first2=D|last3=Pliskin|first3=J|year=1980|title=The Economic Value of Changing Mortality Probabilities: A Decision-Theoretic Approach|url=|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=94 |issue=2|pages=373–396|via=|doi=10.2307/1884546}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people consider the risks of not helping a victim, they consider the probability of being responsible and blamed.&lt;ref name="Douglas, 2017"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-7B2338nHGgC&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q=douglas%20risk%20and%20blame|title=Risk and Blame|last=Douglas|first=Professor Mary|last2=Douglas|first2=Professor of Anthropology Mary|date=2013-06-17|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136490040|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This probability is much greater with identifiable victims than with statistical victims because one cannot accurately predict the likelihood of a tragedy occurring in the future and thus cannot be held responsible for tragedies that ''might'' occur in the future.&lt;ref name= "Jenni &amp; Loewenstein, 1997" /&gt; (Although, Jenni, &amp; Loewenstein (1997) have found no evidence to support the effect of ex post/ex ante on IVE)

This explanation is closest to what Thomas Schelling implied in his now-famous paper.

=== Vividness ===
Identifiable victims, as their name suggests, have features that make them identifiable. Details about their predicament, family background, educational history, etc., are shared through the media and brought to public attention. The stories are emotional, with victims often portrayed as innocent and helpless. For example, Perrault et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perrault|first=Evan K.|last2=Silk|first2=Kami J.|last3=Sheff|first3=Sarah|last4=Ahn|first4=Jisoo|last5=Hoffman|first5=Alice|last6=Totzkay|first6=Daniel|date=2015-10-02|title=Testing the Identifiable Victim Effect With Both Animal and Human Victims in Anti-Littering Messages|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/08824096.2015.1089857|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=32|issue=4|pages=294–303|doi=10.1080/08824096.2015.1089857|issn=0882-4096}}&lt;/ref&gt; tested an identifiable human victim message, in relation to an identifiable animal victim (i.e., a squirrel) using the context of the consequences of littering, and found the identifiable animal message - an innocent and helpless creature - elicited greater levels of distress and empathy than the identifiable human message. Images and videos of the victim are often shared, and the public is able to follow the victim's predicament in real-time. Studies have previously indicated that people respond more to concrete, graphic information than abstract, statistical information.&lt;ref name= "Nisbett, 1980"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Inference: Strategies and Shortcomings of Social Judgment|last=Nisbett|first=Richard|last2=Ross|first2=Lee|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1980|isbn=978-0134451305|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vividness of identifiable victims creates a sense of familiarity and social closeness(opposite of social distance).Therefore, identifiable victims elicit greater reactions from people than statistical victims. (Although, Jenni, &amp; Loewenstein (1997) have found no evidence to support this effect)

=== Certainty effect, risk-seeking for losses and loss aversion ===

The certainty effect and risk seeking for losses reinforce each other. The [[certainty effect]] is the inclination to place disproportionately greater weighting to certain outcomes than to uncertain but likely outcomes.&lt;ref name= "Kanheman &amp; Tversky, 1979"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|last2=Tversky|first2=Amos|date=1979-01-01|title=Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk|jstor=1914185|journal=Econometrica|volume=47|issue=2|pages=263–291|doi=10.2307/1914185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequences to identifiable victims are viewed as certain to occur whereas the consequences to statistical victims are viewed as probabilistic.&lt;ref name= "Jenni &amp; Loewenstein, 1997" /&gt; Research has also shown the tendency of people to be risk-seeking for losses.&lt;ref name= "Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1986"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Amos|last2=Kahneman|first2=Daniel|date=1986-01-01|title=Rational Choice and the Framing of Decisions|jstor=2352759|journal=The Journal of Business|volume=59|issue=4|pages=S251–S278}}&lt;/ref&gt; A certain loss is viewed more negatively than an uncertain loss with the same expected value. Closely related to this is people tend to be loss averse.&lt;ref name= "Kanheman &amp; Tversky, 1979" /&gt; They view saving a statistical life as a gain whereas saving an identifiable victim is seen as avoiding a loss. Together, these effects result in people being more likely to aid identifiable, certain victims than statistical, uncertain victims.

=== Response to the relative size of the reference group ===

Risk that is concentrated is perceived as greater than the same risk dispersed over a wider population. Identifiable victims are their own reference group; if they do not receive aid then the entire reference group is regarded to perish.&lt;ref name= "Jenni &amp; Loewenstein, 1997" /&gt; To illustrate this point, consider an explosion at an offshore oil rig where 50 people work. Suppose all 50 people die in the explosion, this represents 50 of the thousands of people working on offshore oil rigs. Yet, the reference group is not the thousands of people working on offshore oil rigs but rather the 50 people working on that particular offshore oil rig. Therefore, this is perceived as 50 of 50 people certain to die so by aiding them, a significant proportion of the reference group can be saved.

People's response to the proportion of the reference group that can be saved is such a significant contributor to the identifiable victim effect that this effect could be re-labelled as the “percentage of reference group saved effect”.&lt;ref name= "Jenni &amp; Loewenstein, 1997" /&gt;

== Implications and examples ==

=== Aiding ===
One implication of the identifiable victim effect is identifiable victims are more likely to be helped than statistical victims.&lt;ref name= "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Small|first=Deborah A.|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|date=2003-01-01|title=Helping a Victim or Helping the Victim: Altruism and Identifiability|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1022299422219|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=5–16|doi=10.1023/A:1022299422219|issn=0895-5646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An incident that frequently features in literature is the aid given to Jessica McClure and her family.&lt;ref name= "Loewenstein &amp; Small, 2005" /&gt; On October 14, 1987, 18-month old Jessica McClure fell into a narrow well in her aunt's home cum day-care centre in Midland, Texas.&lt;ref name= "Loewenstein &amp; Small, 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loewenstein|first=George|last2=Small|first2=Deborah|last3=Strnad|first3=Jeff|date=2005-03-01|title=Statistical, Identifiable and Iconic Victims and Perpetrators|ssrn=678281|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within hours, 'Baby Jessica', as she became known, made headlines around the US. The public reacted with sympathy towards her ordeal. While teams of rescue workers, paramedics and volunteers worked to successfully rescue 'Baby Jessica' in 58 hours, a total of $700,000 was amassed in that time. Even after being discharged from hospital, the McClure family were flooded with cards and gifts from members of the public as well as a visit from then-Vice President George H.W. Bush and a telephone call from then-President Ronald Reagan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/baby-jessica-rescued-from-a-well-as-the-world-watches|title=October 16, 1987 : Baby Jessica rescued from a well as the world watches|first=|date=2011|website=history.com|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-12|quote=|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Punishment ===
The identifiable victim effect is suggested to be a specific case of a more general 'identifiable other effect'.&lt;ref name= "Loewenstein &amp; Small, 2005" /&gt; As such, it also has an effect on punishments. People prefer to punish identified transgressors rather than unidentified transgressors when given a choice between the two. People also exert more severe punishments on identified than unidentified transgressors.&lt;ref name= "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005" /&gt;

Individuals are also more likely to assign blame to an identified transgressor if they feel they have been wronged. There is also an increased desire for harsh punishments that persists even when self-sacrifice is required in order to punish the transgressor. This effect can possibly be explained by the increased anger felt towards an identified rather than an unidentified transgressor. This supports the theory of “vividness” as a source of the identifiable victim effect (Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005).&lt;ref name = "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005" /&gt;

=== Public policy ===

==== Healthcare ====

The identifiable victim effect may also influence healthcare, both at the individual and national level (Redelmeir &amp; Tversky, 1990).&lt;ref name= "Redelmeir &amp; Tversky, 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Redelmeir | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Tversky | first2 = A. | year = 1990 | title = Discrepancy between medical decisions for individual patients and for groups | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3840/ba46475c2c8d39bb786d304584cb84ae0a10.pdf#page=904 | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 322 | issue = 16| pages = 1162–1164 | doi=10.1056/nejm199004193221620}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the individual level, doctors are more likely to recommend expensive, but potentially life-saving, treatments to an individual patient rather than to a group of patients. This effect is not limited to medical professionals, as laymen demonstrate this same bias towards providing more expensive treatments for individual patients (Redelmeir &amp; Tversky, 1990).&lt;ref name= "Redelmeir &amp; Tversky, 1990" /&gt; On the national level, the American people are far more likely to contribute to an expensive treatment to save the life of one person rather than spend much smaller amounts on [[Preventive healthcare|preventative measures]] that could save the lives of thousands per year. A function of American [[individualism]], this nationwide bias towards expensive treatments is still prevalent today (Toufexis &amp; Bjerklie, 1993).&lt;ref name= "Toufexis &amp; Bjerklie, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toufexis | first1 = A. | last2 = Bjerklie | first2 = D. | year = 1993 | title = The ultimate choice | url = http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.nd.edu/ehost/detail/detail?sid=938602b4-df0c-46ad-9002-c3a01fe3bf00%40sessionmgr4009&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=4214&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=9308240013&amp;db=aph | journal = Time | volume = 142 | issue = 9| page = 43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ryan White Care Act =====
The need to tackle the problems faced by AIDS sufferers was brought to the political forefront as a result of the legal and social plight of one particular AIDS victim, Ryan White. His circumstances and campaign for greater funding for AIDS research were widely publicised in the media which culminated in legislation being passed to provide financial support to AIDS sufferers and their families in 1990 shortly after White's death.&lt;ref name= "Ryan" /&gt;

==== Criminal justice ====

Since the identifiable victim effect can influence punishment, it has the potential to undermine the system of trial by jury (Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005).&lt;ref name= "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005" /&gt; Jurors, when deliberating, work with an identifiable perpetrator, and thus may attach negative emotions (e.g. disgust, anger) to the individual or assign increased blame when handing down a harsh sentence. Policymakers, who are unable to see the individual offender, being almost entirely emotionally removed, may actually have intended a more lenient sentence. This may produce a harsher verdict than the legal guidelines recommend or allow. On the other extreme, jurors may feel [[sympathy]], relating with the perpetrator on a level not experienced by policymakers, leading to a milder verdict than legally appropriate or allowable (Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005).&lt;ref name = "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005" /&gt;

Typically in crime investigations, law enforcement forces conceal any information regarding the identities of the suspects until they have strong evidence that the suspects are credible. When identities of suspects are revealed through description of their features or release of their images, media coverage and public discussion on the issue grows. On one side, the public discourse can become increasingly negative and hostile, or, if the perpetrator is sympathetic, support for the perpetrator may grow. This is because people experience a greater emotional reaction towards a concrete, identifiable perpetrator than an abstract, unidentifiable one.&lt;ref name = "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005" /&gt;

=====Brady Bill =====
[[James Brady|James S. Brady]], the then-White House press secretary, was among three collateral damage victims in the attempted assassination of President Reagan in 1981. Brady was explicitly named in reports of the shooting in contrast to the other two injured, a District of Columbia police officer and a Secret Service agent. The political reaction was largely focused on the injuries of Brady which led to the enactment of the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act|Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993]]. It states that it is mandatory for firearm dealers to perform background searches on firearm purchasers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/brady-act-gun-buyer-background-checks-3321492|title=Brady Act Gun Buyer Background Checks|last=Longley|first=Robert|date=August 23, 2016|website=thoughtco.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business ethics ===

According to a 2016 study by Yam and Reynolds, the growing absence of the identifiable victim effect in the business world may contribute to an increase in unethical business behavior.&lt;ref name= "Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yam | first1 = K. C. | last2 = Reynolds | first2 = S. J. | year = 2016 | title = The effects of victim anonymity on unethical behavior | url = https://link-springer-com.proxy.library.nd.edu/article/10.1007/s10551-014-2367-5 | journal = Journal of Business Ethics | volume = 136 | issue = 1| pages = 13–22 | doi=10.1007/s10551-014-2367-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an increasingly [[Globalization|globalized]] business framework, the identifiable victim effect may become naturally mediated, freeing business leaders and employees alike to engage in unethical behavior without guilt or emotional distress. This may be possible because globalization results in less face-to-face contact, decreasing the identifiability of possible victims. Research suggests that business leaders, as well as workers, are more likely to engage in unethical behavior when the victims of their behavior are anonymous. At the executive level, one possible result of this is worker [[commodification]] and exploitation. At the worker level, employees of a company are possibly more likely to steal from the company or lie on a report if they do not believe this behavior will negatively affect a recognizable coworker. A decrease in recognizable coworkers could thus potentially lead to an increase in unethical behavior by workers (Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016).&lt;ref name= "Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016" /&gt; Research also suggests that outside observers, not only perpetrators, view unethical behavior as less unethical if the victim of the unethical behavior is unidentified (Gino, Shu, &amp; Bazerman, 2010).&lt;ref name= "Gino, Shu, &amp; Bazerman, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gino | first1 = F. | last2 = Shu | first2 = L. L. | last3 = Bazerman | first3 = M. H. | year = 2010 | title = Nameless + harmless = blameless: When seemingly irrelevant factors influence judgment of (un)ethical behavior | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com.proxy.library.nd.edu/science/article/pii/S0749597809001022 | journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes | volume = 111 | issue = 2| pages = 93–101 | doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2009.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could possibly result in less public outcry against unethical practices in a globalized business environment, where the victims are often unseen.

== Moderating factors ==

=== Attachment anxiety ===

High levels of [[Attachment in adults|attachment anxiety]] may increase the power of identifiable victim effect. Research indicates that individuals with high levels of attachment anxiety may donate more to identified victims and donate less to unidentified victims than the average person (Kogut &amp; Kogut, 2013).&lt;ref name="Kogut &amp; Kogut, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kogut | first1 = T. | last2 = Kogut | first2 = E. | year = 2013 | title = Exploring the relationship between adult attachment style and the identifiable victim effect in helping behavior | url = http://isiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/73400.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 4| pages = 651–660 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2013.02.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study by Kogut and Kogut, attachment anxiety may reduce the expression of [[Altruism|altruistic tendencies]], commonly demonstrated by charitable giving. Researchers hypothesize that this is because anxiously-attached individuals focus their time and energy on dealing with their own vulnerabilities, leaving them no mental energy to focus on the well-being of others. However, this would only be true of the unidentified individual. When faced with an identified victim, individuals who are anxiously attached tend to donate more money than the average individual. This aligns with past research indicating that anxiously attached people experience significantly more personal distress than those securely attached when confronted with victims in need (Mikulincer et al., 2001).&lt;ref name="Mikulincer et al., 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikulincer | first1 = M. | last2 = Gillath | first2 = O. | last3 = Halevy | first3 = V. | last4 = Avihou | first4 = N. | last5 = Avidan | first5 = S. | display-authors = 5 | last6 = et al | year = 2001 | title = Attachment theory and reactions to others' needs: Evidence that activation of the sense of attachment security promotes empathic responses | url = http://psycnet.apa.org.proxy.library.nd.edu/journals/psp/81/6/1205/ | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 81 | issue = 6| pages = 1205–1224 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.6.1205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although anxiously-attached people may participate in [[prosocial behavior]]s, such as donating money to a charity, their actions are suggested not to be the result of altruistic tendencies, but instead "positively correlated with egoistic, rather than altruistic motives for helping and volunteering."(p 652)(Kogut, T. &amp; Kogut E., 2013).&lt;ref name="Kogut &amp; Kogut, 2013" /&gt; Thus, researchers hypothesize that anxiously attached individuals are more likely to help identified victims only because they will personally benefit. This is possibly because the identified victim can fulfill the desire for personal attachment, not because the victim is in need. It is important to note that their increased helpfulness only extends to easy, effortless actions, such as donating money. It does not extend to particularly difficult or effortful actions, such as donating time (Kogut &amp; Kogut, 2013).&lt;ref name="Kogut &amp; Kogut, 2013" /&gt;

=== Guilt ===

Research suggests that guilt reduces the power of the identifiable victim effect (Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016).&lt;ref name= "Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016" /&gt; Before engaging in a behavior, an individual conducts an assessment of the possible emotional outcomes of that behavior. An individual is drawn towards behaviors that would make them happy and repulsed by those that would make them upset. Thus, a person with a high level of guilt is drawn towards altruistic acts because they serve to alleviate the negative emotions that they are experiencing. Consequently, the presence of guilt may actually increase the occurrence of altruistic behavior, such as charitable donations, regardless of whether the victim they are helping is identified or not. Research also suggests that anticipated guilt reduces the occurrence of unethical behavior that may negatively affect an identified victim (Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016).&lt;ref name= "Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016" /&gt; This may be because knowingly and negatively affecting a recognizable victim causes the individual engaging in unethical behavior to experience distress and negative emotions.

=== Reasoning style ===

Research suggests that individual differences in reasoning style moderate the identifiable victim effect (Friedrich &amp; McGuire, 2010).&lt;ref name= "Friedrich &amp; McGuire, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Friedrich | first1 = J. | last2 = McGuire | first2 = A. | year = 2010 | title = Individual differences in reasoning style as a moderator of the identifiable victim effect | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15534511003707352 | journal = Social Influence | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 182–201 | doi=10.1080/15534511003707352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two different methods of reasoning are “experiential” and “rational”. [[Cognitive-experiential self-theory#Intuitive-experiential system|Experiential thinking]] (e.g. emotionally-based thinking) is automatic, contextual and fluid, and [[Cognitive-experiential self-theory#Analytical-rational system|rational thinking]] (e.g. logically-based thinking) is deliberative, analytical, and decontextualized. Experiential thinking styles may increase the power of the identifiable victim effect, and rational thinking styles may decrease the power of the identifiable victim effect. Researchers theorize that these differences result because experiential thinkers rely on emotional responses towards an issue when making a decision. In contrast, rational thinkers analyze the situation as a whole before making a decision. Thus, a person thinking rationally would respond to all victims equally, not giving preference to those specifically named or otherwise identified, just as experiential thinkers would be drawn towards the more emotionally charged identified victim (Friedrich &amp; McGuire, 2010).&lt;ref name= "Friedrich &amp; McGuire, 2010" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
The identifiable victim effect has been contested in academia. Critics argue that, when a victim is identified, information such as age and gender of the victim are revealed and people are especially sympathetic in response to that information rather than to identifiability ''per se''.&lt;ref name= "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2003" /&gt;

In 2003, Deborah Small and George Loewenstein conducted an experiment that mitigated this issue. Identifiability was strictly limited to the ''determination'' of the victim's identity.&lt;ref name= "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2003" /&gt; Therefore, the victim had already been identified regardless of whether the participants had known anything specific about their identity or not. The circumstances of the victim were more palpable and thus elicited greater sympathy from participants. In contrast, the identities of statistical victims were not yet determined. As such, participants found it more difficult to sympathize with indeterminate victims.

=== Identification ===

In certain situations, identification of a victim can actually reduce the amount of help offered to that individual. Research suggests that if an individual is seen as responsible for their plight, people are less likely to offer help than if the victim was not identified at all (Kogut, 2011).&lt;ref name= "Kogut, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kogut | first1 = T | year = 2011 | title = Someone to blame: when identifying a victim decreases helping | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.library.nd.edu/store/10.1002/bdm.492/asset/492_ftp.pdf?v=1&amp;t=j1vk6fsl&amp;s=1a3860951722425fce0c1b7d8c04c57cc7ec8f93 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 47 | issue = 4| pages = 748–755 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2011.02.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most research dedicated to the identifiable victim effect avoids the topic of blame, using explicitly blameless individuals, such as children suffering from an illness (Kogut &amp; Ritov, 2005).&lt;ref name= "Kogut &amp; Ritov, 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kogut | first1 = T. | last2 = Ritov | first2 = I. | year = 2005 | title = The "identified victim" effect: an identified group, or just a single individual? | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.library.nd.edu/store/10.1002/bdm.492/asset/492_ftp.pdf?v=1&amp;t=j1vk6fsl&amp;s=1a3860951722425fce0c1b7d8c04c57cc7ec8f93 | journal = Journal of Behavioral Decision Making | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 157–165 | doi=10.1002/bdm.492}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are real-world situations where victims may be seen as to blame for their current situation. For example, in a 2011 study by Kogut, individuals were less likely to offer help to an AIDS victim if the victim had contracted AIDS through sexual contact than if the individual was born with AIDS. In other words, individuals were less likely to offer help to victims if they were seen as at least partially responsible for their plight. A meta-study conducted in 2016 supports these findings, reporting that charitable donations were highest when the victim showed little responsibility for their victimization (Lee &amp; Feeley, 2016).&lt;ref name= "Lee &amp; Feeley, 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = S. | last2 = Feeley | first2 = T. H. | year = 2016 | title = The identifiable victim effect: A meta-analytic review | url = http://www.tandfonline.com.proxy.library.nd.edu/doi/abs/10.1080/15534510.2016.1216891 | journal = Social Influence | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 199–215 | doi=10.1080/15534510.2016.1216891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In such cases where victim blaming is possible, identification of individuals may not induce sympathy and may actually increase negative perception of the victim (Kogut, 2011).&lt;ref name= "Kogut, 2011" /&gt; This reduction in help is even more pronounced if the individual believes in the [[Just-world hypothesis|just world hypothesis]], which is the tendency for people to blame the victim for what has happened to them. This pattern of blame results from a desire to believe that the world is predictable and orderly and that those who suffer must have done something to deserve their suffering.

=== Individual applicability  ===

Research may indicate that the identifiable victim effect only affects identified individuals, not identified groups (Kogut &amp; Ritov, 2005).&lt;ref name= "Kogut &amp; Ritov, 2005" /&gt; A 2005 study by Kogut and Ritov asked participants how much they would be willing to donate to either a critically ill child or a group of eight critically ill children. Although identification of the individual child increased donations, identification of the group of children as a whole did not. Researchers also found that, although both the individual and group evoked similar amounts of empathy, individual victims evoked more emotional distress than groups of victims. Continuing from this, researchers hypothesized that [[Psychological pain|emotional distress]], not empathy, appears to be positively correlated with desire to help, or “willingness to contribute.” This supports the idea that altruistic acts may serve as coping mechanisms to alleviate negative emotions, such as guilt (Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016).&lt;ref name= "Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016" /&gt; This also supports later research that suggests distress and sympathy are the driving emotional factors behind the identifiable victim effect (Erlandsson, Björklund, &amp; Bäckström, 2015).&lt;ref name= "Erlandsson, Björklund, &amp; Bäckström, 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erlandsson | first1 = A. | last2 = Björklund | first2 = F. | last3 = Bäckström | first3 = M. | year = 2015 | title = Emotional reactions, perceived impact and perceived responsibility mediate the identifiable victim effect, proportion dominance effect and in-group effect respectively | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com.proxy.library.nd.edu/science/article/pii/S0749597814001022 | journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes | volume = 127 | issue = | pages = 1–14 | doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2014.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter''''' is a 2011 book by [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] [[Terrence Deacon]]. The book covers topics in [[biosemiotics]], [[philosophy of mind]], and [[Abiogenesis|the origins of life]]. Broadly, the book seeks to [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistically]] explain "[[aboutness]]", that is, concepts like [[intentionality]], meaning, [[normative|normativity]], purpose, and [[function (biology)|function]]; which Deacon groups together and labels as [[ententional]] phenomena.

==Core Ideas==
Deacon's first book, ''[[The Symbolic Species]]'' focused on the [[Origin of language|evolution of human language]]. In that book, Deacon notes that much of the mystery surrounding language origins comes from a profound confusion on the nature of [[semiotic]] processes themselves. Accordingly, the focus of ''Incomplete Nature'' shifts from [[Human evolution|human origins]] to the [[origin of life]] and [[semiosis]]. ''Incomplete Nature'' can be viewed as a sizable contribution to the growing body of work positing that the problem of [[consciousness]] and the problem of the [[origin of life]] are inexorably linked.&lt;ref&gt;Slanted Truths: Essays on Gaia, Symbiosis and Evolution. Lynn Margulis, Dorion Sagan, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology, and the Sciences of Mind. Evan Thompson. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Deacon tackles these two linked problems by going back to basics. The book expands upon the classical conceptions of [[work (physics)|work]] and [[information]]  in order to give an account of [[entention]]ality that is consistent with [[eliminative materialism]] and yet does not seek to explain away or pass off as [[Epiphenomenon|epiphenominal]] the non-physical properties of [[life]].

==Constraints==
A central thesis of the book is that absence can still be efficacious. Deacon makes the claim that just as the concept of [[zero]] revolutionized mathematics, thinking about life, mind, and other [[ententional]] phenomena in terms of constraints (i.e., what is absent) can similarly help us overcome the artificial dichotomy of the [[mind body problem]]. A good example of this concept is the hole that defines the hub of a wagon wheel. The hole itself is not a physical thing, but rather a source of constraint that helps to restrict the conformational possibilities of the wheel's components, such that, on a global scale, the property of rolling emerges.  Constraints which produce [[emergence|emergent]] phenomena may not be a process which can be understood by looking at the make-up of the constituents of a pattern. Emergent phenomena are difficult to study because their complexity does not necessarily decompose into parts. When a pattern is broken down, the constraints are no longer at work; there is no hole, no absence to notice. Imagine a hub, a hole for an axle, produced only when the wheel is rolling, thus breaking the wheel may not show you how the hub emerges.

==Orthograde and contragrade==
Deacon notes that the apparent patterns of [[causality]] exhibited by living systems seem to be in some ways the inverse of the causal patterns of non-living systems.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In an attempt to find a solution to the philosophical problems associated with [[teleology|teleological]] explanations, Deacon returns to [[Aristotle's]] [[four causes]] and attempts to modernize them with [[thermodynamic]] concepts.

[[File:Orthograde and contragrade.jpg|450px|A cartoon characterization of the asymmetry implicit in thermodynamic change from a constrained ("ordered") state to a less constrained ("disordered") state, which tends to occur spontaneously (an orthograde process), contrasted with the reversed direction of change, which does not tend to occur spontaneously (a contragrade process), and so only tends to occur in response to the imposition of highly constrained external work (arrows in the image on the right).]]

'''Orthograde''' changes are caused internally. They are spontaneous changes. That is, orthograde changes are generated by the spontaneous elimination of asymmetries in a thermodynamic system in disequilibrium. Because orthograde changes are driven by the internal geometry of a changing system, orthograde causes can be seen as analogous to [[Aristotle's]] [[formal cause]]. More loosely, [[Aristotle's]] [[final cause]] can also be considered orthograde, because goal oriented actions are caused from within.&lt;ref&gt;''Incomplete Nature'', pp. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contragrade''' changes are imposed from the outside. They are non-spontaneous changes. Contragrade change is induced when one thermodynamic system interacts with the orthograde changes of another thermodynamic system. The interaction drives the first system into a higher energy, more asymmetrical state. Contragrade changes do [[work (physics)|work]]. Because contragrade changes are driven by external interactions with another changing system, contragrade causes can be seen as analogous to [[Aristotle's]] [[efficient cause]].&lt;ref&gt;''Incomplete Nature'', pp. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homeodynamics, morphodynamics, and teleodynamics==
Much of the book is devoted to expanding upon the ideas of classical [[thermodynamics]], with an extended discussion about how consistently [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|far from equilibrium systems]] can interact and combine to produce novel [[emergence|emergent]] properties. 
[[File:Homomorphoteleo.jpg|thumb|400px]]

Deacon defines three hierarchically nested levels of thermodynamic systems: '''Homeodynamic''' systems combine to produce '''morphodynamic''' systems which combine to produce '''teleodynamic''' systems. Teleodynamic systems can be further combined to produce higher orders of [[self organization]].

===Homeodynamics===
Homeodynamic systems are essentially equivalent to classical [[thermodynamic systems]] like a gas under pressure or solute in solution, but the term serves to emphasize that homeodynamics is an abstract process that can be realized in forms beyond the scope of [[thermodynamics|classic thermodynamics]]. For example, the diffuse brain activity normally associated with emotional states can be considered to be a homeodynamic system because there is a general state of equilibrium which its components (neural activity) distribute towards.&lt;ref&gt;''Incomplete Nature'', pp.561 "Experience should have clear equilibrium-tending, dissipative, and self-organizing characteristics, besides those that are intentional. These are inseparable dynamical features that literally constitute experience."&lt;/ref&gt; In general, a homeodynamic system is any collection of components that will spontaneously eliminate constraints by rearranging the parts until a maximum [[entropy]] state (disorderliness) is achieved.

===Morphodynamics===
A morphodynamic system consists of a coupling of two homeodynamic systems such that the constraint dissipation of each complements the other, producing macroscopic order out of microscopic interactions. Morphodynamic systems require constant perturbation to maintain their structure, so they are relatively rare in nature. The paradigm example of a morphodynamic system is a [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Rayleigh–Bénard cell]]. Other common examples are [[Snowflake#formation|snowflake formation]], [[whirlpools]] and the [[stimulated emission]] of [[laser]] light.

[[File:Benard cell.jpg|thumb|500px|Benard Cell]]
'''Maximum entropy production:''' The organized structure of a morphodynamic system forms to facilitate maximal entropy production. In the case of a [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Rayleigh–Bénard cell]], heat at the base of the liquid produces an uneven distribution of high energy molecules which will tend to diffuse towards the surface. As the temperature of the heat source increases, [[density]] effects come into play. Simple [[diffusion]] can no longer dissipate energy as fast as it is added and so the bottom of the liquid becomes hot and more [[buoyant]] than the cooler, denser liquid at the top. The bottom of the liquid begins to rise, and the top begins to sink - producing [[convection]] currents.

'''Two systems:''' The significant heat differential on the liquid produces two homeodynamic systems. The first is a diffusion system, where high energy molecules on the bottom collide with lower energy molecules on the top until the added kinetic energy from the heat source is evenly distributed. The second is a convection system, where the low density fluid on the bottom mixes with the high density fluid on the top until the density becomes evenly distributed. The second system arises when there is too much energy to be effectively dissipated by the first, and once both systems are in place, they will begin to interact.

'''Self organization:''' The convection creates currents in the fluid that disrupt the pattern of heat diffusion from bottom to top. Heat begins to diffuse into the denser areas of current, irrespective of the vertical location of these denser portions of fluid. The areas of the fluid where diffusion is occurring most rapidly will be the most viscous because molecules are rubbing against each other in opposite directions. The convection currents will shun these areas in favor of parts of the fluid where they can flow more easily. And so the fluid spontaneously segregates itself into cells where high energy, low density fluid flows up from the center of the cell and cooler, denser fluid flows down along the edges, with diffusion effects dominating in the area between the center and the edge of each cell.

'''Synergy and constraint:''' What is notable about morphodynamic processes is that order spontaneously emerges explicitly because the ordered system that results is more efficient at increasing entropy than a chaotic one. In the case of the [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Rayleigh–Bénard cell]], neither diffusion nor convection on their own will produce as much entropy as both effects coupled together. When both effects are brought into interaction, they constrain each other into a particular geometric form because that form facilitates minimal interference between the two processes. The orderly hexagonal form is stable as long as the energy differential persists, and yet the orderly form more effectively degrades the energy differential than any other form. This is why morphodynamic processes in nature are usually so short lived. They are self organizing, but also self undermining.

===Teleodynamics===
A teleodynamic system consists of coupling two morphodynamic systems such that the self undermining quality of each is constrained by the other. Each system prevents the other from dissipating all of the energy available, and so long term organizational stability is obtained. Deacon claims that we should pinpoint the moment when two morphodynamic systems reciprocally constrain each other as the point when [[ententional]] qualities like [[Function (biology)|function]], [[purpose]] and [[normative|normativity]] emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature pg. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

====Autogenesis====
Deacon explores the properties of teleodynamic systems by describing a chemically plausible model system called an autogen. Deacon emphasizes that the specific autogen he describes is not a proposed description of the first life form, but rather a description of the kinds of thermodynamic synergies that the first living creature likely possessed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24896328 The transition from constraint to regulation at the origin of life.] Frontiers in Bioscience. Terrence W. Deacon, Alok Srivastava, and J. Augustus Bacigalupi&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Autogenesis.jpg|thumb|500px|Autogen pg 339]]

'''Reciprocal catalysis:''' An autogen consists of two self [[Catalysts|catalyzing]] cyclical morphodynamic chemical reactions, similar to a [[chemoton]]. In one reaction, organic molecules react in a looped series, the products of one reaction becoming the reactants for the next. This looped reaction is self amplifying, producing more and more reactants until all the substrate is consumed. A side product of this reciprocally catalytic loop is a [[lipid]] that can be used as a reactant in a second reaction. This second reaction creates a boundary (either a [[microtubule]] or some other closed [[capsid]] like structure), that serves to contain the first reaction. The boundary limits [[diffusion]]; it keeps all of the necessary [[catalysts]] in close proximity to each other. In addition, the boundary prevents the first reaction from completely consuming all of the available substrate in the environment.

'''The first self:''' Unlike an isolated morphodynamic process whose organization rapidly eliminates the energy gradient necessary to maintain its structure, a teleodynamic process is self-limiting and self preserving. The two reactions complement each other, and ensure that neither ever runs to equilibrium - that is completion, cessation, and [[death]]. So, in a teleodynamic system there will be structures that embody a preliminary sketch of a [[biological function]]. The internal reaction network functions to create the [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] for the boundary reaction, and the boundary reaction functions to protect and constrain the internal reaction network. Either process in isolation would be [[abiotic]] but together they create a system with a [[normative]] status dependent on the functioning of its component parts.

&lt;!--
======Autogenesis and Autopoesis======
Deacon's model of an autogen bears a striking resemblance to the [[autopoesis|autopoetic]] theory proposed by [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela|Fransisco Varela]] in 1973. However, Deacon takes pains to differentiate teleodynamics from autopoesis.

Deacon notes that autopoiesis is an update on the [[Kantian]] reciprocal production of parts conception of organisms. The problem with this approach is that is assumes the two most critical features necessary for life (and teleodynamics): (1) how the network of co-producing components is maintained as a "unity" in such a way that its coherent organization can be reconstituted or reproduced in a new system, and (2) how this unit "self" maintains itself far-from-equilibrium. [[Autopoiesis]] is an abstract description of what must be true of an organism, without outlining how these defining properties are accomplished. Indeed, as stated, [[autopoiesis]] describes morphodynamic processes, though without an account of the thermodyanamics involved. But morphodynamic processes don't spontaneously hold together, indeed, they are organized in a way that maximally destroys the conditions that produce them because they are entirely driven by extrinsic dynamics. Essentially, [[autopoesis]] is a description of the processes defining life, while autogenesis describes how they are dynamically achieved.&lt;ref&gt;The transition from constraint to regulation at the origin of life. Frontiers in Bioscience (in press, pg 4-5). Terrence W. Deacon, Alok Srivastava, and J. Augustus Bacigalupi&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

==Work==
As with other concepts in the book, in his discussion of [[work (physics)|work]] Deacon seeks to generalize the [[Newtonian mechanics#Work and energy|Newtonian]] conception of work such that the term can be used to describe and differentiate mental phenomena - to describe "that which makes daydreaming effortless but metabolically equivalent problem solving difficult."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature, pg.365&lt;/ref&gt;  Work is generally described as "activity that is necessary to overcome resistance to change. Resistance can be either active or passive, and so work can be directed towards enacting change that wouldn't otherwise occur or preventing change that would happen in its absence."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature, pg. 366&lt;/ref&gt; Using the terminology developed earlier in the book, work can be considered to be "the organization of differences between orthograde processes such that a locus of contragrade process is created. Or, more simply, work is a spontaneous change inducing a non-spontaneous change to occur."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature, pg.371&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermodynamic work===

A thermodynamic systems capacity to do work depends less upon the total energy of the system and more upon the geometric distribution of its components. A glass of water at 20 degrees Celsius will have the same amount of energy as a glass divided in half with the top [[fluid]] at 30 degrees and the bottom at 10, but only in the second glass will the top half have the capacity to do work upon the bottom. This is because work occurs at both [[macroscopic]] and [[microscopic]] levels. Microscopically, there is constant work being performed on one molecule by another when they collide. But the potential for this microscopic work to additively sum to macroscopic work depends on there being an asymmetric distribution of particle speeds, so that the average collision pushes in a focused direction. Microscopic work is [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary but not sufficient]] for macroscopic work. A global property of asymmetric distribution is also required.

===Morphodynamic work===

By recognizing that asymmetry is a general property of work - that work is done as asymmetric systems spontaneously tend towards symmetry, Deacon abstracts the concept of work and applies it to systems whose symmetries are vastly more complex than those covered by [[classical thermodynamics]]. In a morphodynamic system, the tendency towards symmetry produces not global [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]], but a complex geometric form like a hexagonal [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection|Benard cell]] or the [[resonant frequency]] of a flute. This tendency towards convolutedly symmetric forms can be harnessed to do [[work (physics)|work]] on other morphodynamic systems, if the systems are properly coupled.

'''Resonance example:''' A good example of morphodynamic work is the induced [[resonance]] that can be observed by singing or playing a flute next to a string instrument like a harp or guitar. The vibrating air emitted from the flute will interact with the taut strings. If any of the strings are tuned to a [[resonant frequency]] that matches the note being played, they too will begin to vibrate and emit sound.

'''Contragrade change:''' When energy is added to the flute by blowing air into it, there is a spontaneous (orthograde) tendency for the system to dissipate the added energy by inducing the air within the flute to vibrate at a specific frequency. This orthograde morphodynamic form generation can be used to induce contragrade change in the system coupled to it - the taught string. Playing the flute does work on the string by causing it to enter a high energy state that could not be reached spontaneously in an uncoupled state.

'''Structure and form:''' Importantly, this is not just the macro scale propagation of random micro vibrations from one system to another. The global geometric structure of the system is essential. The total energy transferred from the flute to the string matters far less than the patterns it takes in transit. That is, the [[amplitude]] of the coupled note is irrelevant, what matters is its [[frequency]]. Notes that have a higher or lower frequency than the resonant frequency of the string will not be able to do morphodynamic work.

===Teleodynamic work===

Work is generally defined to be the interaction of two orthograde changing systems such that contragrade change is produced.&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature pg. 366&lt;/ref&gt; In teleodynamic systems, the spontaneous orthograde tendency is not to equilibriate (as in homeodynamic systems), nor to self simplify (as in morphodynamic systems) but rather to tend towards self-preservation. Living organisms spontaneously tend to [[Healing|heal]], to [[Reproduction|reproduce]] and to pursue resources towards these ends.  Teleodynamic work acts on these tendencies and pushes them in a contragrade, non-spontaneous direction. 
[[File:Reading 2.jpg|300px|thumb|Reading exemplifies the logic of teleodynamic work. A passive source of cognitive constraints is potentially provided by the letterforms on a page. A literate person has structured his or her sensory and cognitive habits to use such letterforms to reorganize the neural activities constituting thinking. This enables us to do teleodynamic work to shift mental tendencies away from those that are spontaneous (such as daydreaming) to those that are constrained by the text. Artist: [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]] (1682–1754).]]

'''Evolution as work:''' [[Natural selection]], or perhaps more accurately, [[adaptation]], can be considered to be a ubiquitous form of teleodynamic work. The othograde self-preservation and reproduction tendencies of individual organisms tends to undermine those same tendencies in conspecifics. This competition produces a constraint that tends to mold organisms into forms that are more adapted to their environments – forms that would otherwise not spontaneously persist.

For example, in a population of New Zealand [[wrybill]] who make a living by searching for grubs under rocks, those that have a bent beak gain access to more calories. Those with bent beaks are able to better provide for their young, and at the same time they remove a disproportionate quantity of grubs from their environment, making it more difficult for those with straight beaks to provide for their own young. Throughout their lives, all the [[wrybill]]s in the population do work to structure the form of the next generation. The increased efficiency of the bent beak causes that morphology to dominate the next generation. Thus an asymmetry of beak shape distribution is produced in the population - an asymmetry produced by teleodynamic work.

'''Thought as work:''' Mental problem solving can also be considered teleodynamic work. Thought forms are spontaneously generated, and task of problem solving is the task of molding those forms to fit the context of the problem at hand. Deacon makes the link between evolution as teleodynamic work and thought as teleodynamic work explicit. "The experience of being sentient is what it feels like to ''be'' evolution."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature. pg 550&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emergent causal powers====

By conceiving of work in this way, Deacon claims "we can begin to discern ''a basis for a form of causal openness'' in the universe."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature. pg.379&lt;/ref&gt; While increases in complexity in no way alter the laws of physics, by juxtaposing systems together, pathways of spontaneous change can be made available that were inconceivably improbable prior to the systems coupling. The causal power of any complex living system lies not solely in the underlying [[quantum mechanics]] but also in the global arrangement of its components. A careful arrangement of parts can constrain possibilities such that phenomena that were formerly impossibly rare can become improbably common.

==Information==
One of the central purposes of Incomplete Nature is to articulate a theory of biological [[information]]. The first formal [[Information Theory|theory of information]] was articulated by [[Claude E. Shannon|Claude Shannon]] in 1948 in his work [[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]. Shannon's work is widely credited with ushering in the [[information age]], but somewhat paradoxically, it was completely silent on questions of [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and [[reference]], i.e., what the information is ''about.'' As an engineer, Shannon was concerned with the challenge of reliably transmitting a message from one location to another. The meaning and content of the message was largely irrelevant. So, while Shannon information theory has been essential for the development of devices like [[computers]], it has left open many philosophical questions regarding the nature of information. Incomplete Nature seeks to answer some of these questions.

===Shannon information===
Shannon's key insight was to recognize a link between [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] and [[information]]. [[Entropy]] is often defined as a measurement of disorder, or randomness, but this can be misleading. For Shannon's purposes, the entropy of a system is the number of possible states that the system has the capacity to be in. Any one of these potential states can constitute a message. For example, a typewritten page can bear as many different messages as there are different combinations of characters that can be arranged on the page. The information content of a message can only be understood against the background context of all of the messages that could have been sent, but weren't. Information is produced by a reduction of entropy in the message medium. 
[[File:Information Shannon Boltzmann Darwin.jpg|thumb|500px|Three nested conceptions of information]]

===Boltzmann entropy===
Shannon's information based conception of entropy should be distinguished from the more classic [[thermodynamic]] conception of entropy developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] and others at the end of the nineteenth century. While Shannon entropy is static and has to do with the set of all possible messages/states that a signal bearing system might take, Boltzmann entropy has to do with the tendency of all dynamic systems to tend towards equilibrium. That is, there are many more ways for a collection of particles to be well mixed than to be segregated based on velocity, mass, or any other property. Boltzmann entropy is central to the theory of work developed earlier in the book because entropy dictates the direction in which a system will spontaneously tend.

===Significant information===
Deacon's addition to Shannon information theory is to propose a method for describing not just how a message is transmitted, but also how it is interpreted. Deacon weaves together Shannon entropy and Boltzmann entropy in order to develop a theory of interpretation based in teleodynamic work. Interpretation is inherently normative. Data becomes information when it has significance for its interpreter. Thus interpretive systems are teleodynamic - the interpretive process is designed to perpetuate itself. "The interpretation of something as information indirectly reinforces the capacity to do this again."&lt;ref&gt;Incomplete Nature. pg. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Index of Spousal Abuse''' (ISA) is a 30-item [[Self-report study|self-report]] scale developed to measure the severity of physical and non-physical aggression inflicted on a woman by her [[spouse]] or partner. The ISA has become a popular measure in medical settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Adult Aggression Measures|author=Coccaro, Emil|title=Aggression: Psychiatric Assessment and Treatment|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created from the [[conflict tactics scale]], one of the earliest instruments used to identify [[Intimate partner violence|violence between partners]] by measuring interpersonal aggression, in which 19 items pertain to non-physical abuse and 11 pertain to [[physical abuse]]. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (very frequently). Both of these scales are part of assessing the [[cycle of abuse]].

The '''infinite canvas''' refers to the potentially limitless space that is available to [[webcomics]] presented on the [[World Wide Web]]. The term was introduced by [[Scott McCloud]] in his 2000 book ''[[Reinventing Comics]]'', in which he suggested that webcomic creators could make a [[Web page]] as large as needed to contain a comic page of any conceivable size. This infinite canvas would create an endless amount of storytelling benefits and would allow creators much more freedom in how they present their artwork.

Journalists responded skeptically to McCloud's idea of the infinite canvas, as five years after ''Reinventing Comics'', the concept had not taken off in large proportions yet. Webcomics were primarily presented in the form of [[comic strips]], which fit easily on a screen. Various webcomic creators have experimented with the infinite canvas, however, and extending comics to beyond what is possible in print has gained some popularity over the years.

==Description==
[[File:Comic reading order.png|thumb|right|McCloud considered the reading order for a traditional comic page complex, as adjacent panels do not always represent "adjacent" moments.&lt;ref name=ReinventingComics /&gt;|alt=Nine empty panels are shown in a 3-by-3 grid. Arrows demonstrate the traditional reading order, pointing from the first panel of the first row to the third panel of the first row, down to the first panel of the second row and so on.]]
In [[comic books]], the panels of each page are laid out in such as a way to fit perfectly on the page, forcing cartoonists into a relatively small set of possible panel lay-outs per page. In his 2000 book ''Reinventing Comics'', cartoonist Scott McCloud proposed a solution for this situation in the form of the web page. Instead of using the monitor on which a webcomic is read as a "page", McCloud suggested using it as a "window" upon an infinite canvas. A webcomic could be made to be infinitely large, and the cartoonist could give a reader the ability to [[zooming user interface|zoom in and out]] on it at will. McCloud claimed webcomics could be laid out in any shape: vertically like a tower, horizontally like a skyline, diagonally like a descending staircase, or even three dimensionally like a revolving cube.&lt;ref name=ReinventingComics&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Reinventing Comics]]|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|last=McCloud|first=Scott|author-link=Scott McCloud|year=2000|page=220&amp;ndash;229|isbn=0-06-095350-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David Balan of ''[[Sequart Organization]]'', webcomics with pages of limited size that use [[hyperlinks]] to move forward in the story consistently take the reader out of the experience, as there exists no visual link between any two pages. This issue is solved with a long, scrollable canvas, where the webcomic is presented as one long image. Such a webcomic may drag on, however, due to a lack of rhythm or punctuated story beats. Balan praised McCloud's 2003 webcomic ''[[The Right Number]]'' for its zooming interface, which would have the same benefits as other infinite canvas formats, but still allows for a certain rhythm to exist.&lt;ref name=Sequart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sequart.org/magazine/4728/the-right-number-–-a-new-reading-convention/|work=[[Sequart Organization]]|title=The Right Number – A New Reading Convention|last=Balan|first=David|date=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists known for making persistent use of the infinite canvas in the early 2000s include [[Cayetano Garza]], [[demian5]], [[Patrick Farley]], [[Tristan A. Farnon]] and David Gaddis.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Webcomics|publisher=[[Antarctic Press]]|last=Campbell|first=T.|date=2006-06-08|isbn=0976804395|pages=17-18, 30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations and responses==
In 2005, Sarah Boxer of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that the infinite canvas was hard to find in use, as many webcomic were sticking to a printable format. A few, however, like Nicholas Gurewitch's ''[[The Perry Bible Fellowship]]'' and [[Drew Weing]]'s ''Pup'', did make use of the format (''Pup'' won a [[Web Cartoonists' Choice Award]] in the "infinite canvas" category in 2005). Boxer pointed out that most popular webcomics either fit on a webpage easily &amp;ndash; such as Adrian Ramos's ''[[Count Your Sheep]]'' &amp;ndash; or attempted to use various aspects of the digital medium, such as [[Flash animation]] and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/17/books/comics-escape-a-paper-box-and-electronic-questions-pop-out.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|title=Comics Escape a Paper Box, and Electronic Questions Pop Out|last=Boxer|first=Sarah|date=2005-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, [[Joe Zabel]] also noted that the primary purpose for the infinite canvas would be to create lengthy and deep works on the Web, while [[comic strips]] like ''[[PvP]]'' and ''[[Penny Arcade]]'' showed to have much more success in this environment. Because of the time that would go into any page of an infinite canvas comic, Zabel deemed it unlikely for such webcomics to gain a large popularity. Journalist [[Eric Burns]], meanwhile, claimed that McCloud was mainly discussing the potential of webcomics, rather than what they are actually like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcomicsreview.com/examiner/issue050912/history1.html|publisher=''[[The Webcomics Examiner]]''|title=The Artistic History of Webcomics &amp;ndash; A Webcomics Examiner Roundtable|author=Various|year=2005|archive-date=2005-11-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124120515/http://webcomicsreview.com/examiner/issue050912/history1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in 2008, Scot McCloud said that in ''Reinventing Comics'' he was "shooting for the moon, in hopes that we could create these radical departures from traditional comics," noting that "most online comics are still pretty conservative in format and style" but also that "there have been some impressive strides in that direction." McCloud specified that he was still keeping an eye on things that needed to happen for the infinite canvas to take off, saying that "the notion of Web applications being as robust as desktop applications has placed us closer to that hope that we may finally be able to create those spaces in a seamless way online. Right now, it's very difficult to do that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xconomy.com/national/2008/09/10/the-infinite-canvas-an-interview-with-scott-mccloud-the-google-chrome-comic-guy/|work=[[Xconomy]]|title=The Infinite Canvas: An Interview with Scott McCloud, the Google Chrome Comic Guy|last=Roush|first=Wade|date=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in 2014, McCloud said that "without a reliable financial structure to support these experimental webcomics, a lot of people just turn away and get a real job, or start doing three-panel gag strips. Those have an [[Webcomics and income|economic model]] that works."&lt;ref name=2014interview&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2014/10/07/best-american-comics-2014-guest-editor-scott-mccloud-illuminates-the-range-of-modern-brilliance-in-new-must-read-qa/|work=[[the Washington Post]]|title='BEST AMERICAN COMICS 2014': Guest editor Scott McCloud illuminates the range of modern brilliance in new must-read [Q+A]|last=Cavna|first=Michael|date=2014-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the format's popularity, a large amount of cartoonists have created infinite canvas webcomics over the years; in the book ''Storytelling in the Media Convergence Age'', cartoonist Daniel Goodbrew states that "the infinite canvas has remained a popular choice among webcomic creators."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Storytelling in the Media Convergence Age: Exploring Screen Narratives|publisher=[[Springer (publisher)|Springer]]|last1=Pearson|first1=R.|last2=Smith|first2=A.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y_S3BgAAQBAJ|date=2014-12-18|isbn=1137388153}}&lt;/ref&gt; The infinite canvas has shown more success in Europe and Australia than in North America. The infinite canvas has obtained a large popularity among South Korean [[webtoons]]: McCloud noted in 2014 that "most digital comics are [[scrolling|scrollers]] in Korea."&lt;ref name=2014interview /&gt;

==Usage and augmentation==
[[File:Infinite Canvas trails.PNG|thumb|right|Scott McCloud described the possibility of linking webcomic panels using "trails", suggesting it offers distinct storytelling advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottmccloud.com/1-webcomics/icst/icst-4/icst-4.html|work=I Can't Stop Thinking!|title=Follow that Trail|last=McCloud|first=Scott|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=Blank panels of various sizes are linked by a line, guiding a reader's eyes right, down, left, diagonally up, and down again.]]
In 2005, [[Daniel Merlin Goodbrey]] created the "Tarquin Engine", a piece of Web software that uses [[Adobe Flash]] to depict an infinite canvas that a reader can freely scroll through and zoom in on. It greatly simplified the production of infinite canvas webcomics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchprofiles.herts.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-tarquin-engine(97678b47-06d7-4551-9def-5dc987991b71)/export.html|publisher=[[University of Hertfordshire]]|title=The Tarquin Engine|last=Goodbrey|first=Daniel Merlin|author-link=Daniel Merlin Goodbrey|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcomicsreview.com/?p=151&amp;page=3 |work=The Webcomics Examiner |title=Making Lightning &amp;ndash; An Interview with Scott McCloud |last=Zabel |first=Joe |author-link=Joe Zabel |date=2006-06-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324025118/http://webcomicsreview.com/?p=151&amp;page=3 |archive-date=2008-03-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tool is not widely used. In 2009, [[Microsoft Live Labs]] released an infinite canvas [[web application]], which reached a wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=hnuQBQAAQBAJ&amp;dq="The+Right+Number"+McCloud&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas|last=Booker|first=M. Keith|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|date=2014-10-28|page=1825|isbn=0313397511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Yvyes Bigerel and [[Mark Waid]] of [[Marvel Comics]] launched an initiative to create and publish digital comics under the title [[Marvel ReEvolution]]. While creating these webcomics, Bigerel and Waid were inspired by the manner in which time is experienced within comics, as the passage of time in a comic book is ultimately controlled by its reader. Rather than to allow readers to skim through the images on a whim or to increase the space between panels as McCloud suggested, the duo stacked the panels up "like a [[PowerPoint]] slideshow," forcing the reader to look at one panel at a time. According to ''[[Comic Book Resources]]'', this design directly affects how a comic is created and read, as surprises can be better controlled and a letterer could directly control the reading order of text balloons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2013/06/the-digital-evolution-from-infinite-canvas-to-infinite-comics/|publisher=''[[Comic Book Resources]]''|title=The digital evolution: from infinite canvas to infinite comics|last=Blake|first=Corey|date=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rachel Edidin of ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' said of ''Wolverine: Japan's Most Wanted'' and ''Iron Man: Fatal Frontier'' that "these are comics that truly feel native to the digital format."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/07/marvel-iron-man-infinite-comics/|work=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|title=Exclusive: Marvel Rebuilds Iron Man for the Infinite Canvas of Digital Comics|last=Edidin|first=Rachel|date=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Oculus Story Studio]] released Quill, a piece of software that allows people to create a three-dimensional world on an "infinite canvas", meant to be experienced through [[virtual reality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/oculus-new-infinite-canvas-will-make-you-question-your-place-in-the-universe|publisher=[[Motherboard (website)|Motherboard]]|title=Oculus’s New 'Infinite Canvas' Will Make You Question Your Place in the Universe|last=Cole|first=Samantha|date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2016/12/20/oculus-quill-multiple-realities/#Y8OHRbdAEPq1|work=[[Mashable]]|title=Oculus Quill shows how 'Inception'-like layered realities appear in VR|last=Strange|first=Adario|date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological factors==
A person's "...sense of personal insignificance comes from two primary experiences: (a) the developmental experience with its increasing awareness of separation and loss, transience, and the sense of lost felt perfectibility; and (b) the increasing cognitive awareness of the immutable laws of biology and the limitations of the self and others in which idealization gives way to painful reality." To deal with feelings of insignificance, "...each individual seeks [[narcissistic]] reparation through the elaboration of a personal narrative or myth, a story, which gives one's life a feeling of personal significance, meaning, and purpose." These "...myths provide the individual with a personal sense of identity, and they confirm and affirm memberships in a group or community, and provide guidelines and an idealized set of behaviors..., [and] endorse an explanation for the mysterious universe."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw JA. Narcissism as a motivational structure: the problem of personal significance. ''Psychiatry''. 2000 Fall;63(3):219-30.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{wiktionary|insignificance}}
In modern society, people living in crowded, anonymous major cities may face feelings of insignificance. [[George Simmel]]'s work has addressed the issue of how the "dissociation typical of modern city life, the freeing of the person from traditional social ties as from each other" can lead to a "loss or diminution of individuality." Moreover, when a person feels like "...just another face in the crowd, an object of indifference to strangers", it can "lead to feelings of insignificance..."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

''Theory and Practice of Group Counseling''. Cengage Learning, 2011. p.170.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''The Fear of Insignificance'', psychologist [[Carlo Strenger]] "...diagnoses the wide-spread fear of the global educated class of leading insignificant lives."&lt;ref&gt;Amazon Book Description. Available at: www.amazon.com/Fear-Insignificance-Searching-Meaning-Twenty-First/dp/0230113753. Accessed on Dec. 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Strenger warns "...that the global celebrity culture is adding fuel to the 'fear of insignificance' by undermining one’s self-image and sense of self-worth." He noted that "...over recent years people around the world have been suffering from an increasing fear of their own 'insignificance'." He argues that the "impact of the global [[infotainment]] network on the individual is to blame," because it has led to the creation of "a new species...homo globalis – global man." In this new system, people "...are defined by our intimate connection to the global infotainment network, which has turned ranking and rating people on scales of wealth and [[celebrity]] into an obsession." 

Strenger states that "...as humans we naturally measure ourselves to those around us, but now that we live in a “global village” we are comparing ourselves with the most “significant” [celebrity] people in the world, and finding ourselves wanting." He notes that "...in the past being a lawyer or doctor was a very reputable profession, but in this day and age, even high achievers constantly fear that they are insignificant when they compare themselves to [celebrity] success stories in the media. Strenger claims that this "...creates highly unstable self-esteem and an unstable society."&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt;

[[Alain de Botton]] describes some of the same issues in his book ''[[Status Anxiety]]''. Botton's book examines people's anxiety about whether they are judged a success or a failure. De Botton claims that chronic anxiety about status is an inevitable [[unintended consequence|side effect]] of any [[democracy|democratic]], ostensibly [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] [[society]].

[[Edith Wharton]] stated that “It is less mortifying to believe one's self unpopular than insignificant, and vanity prefers to assume that indifference is a latent form of unfriendliness.” &lt;ref&gt; http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/insignificance&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Tolstoy]] wrote that “If you once realize that to-morrow, if not to-day, you will die and nothing will be left of you, everything becomes insignificant!”&lt;ref&gt; http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/insignificance&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==

[[Blaise Pascal]] emphasized "the apparent insignificance of human existence, the "...dread of an unknown future", and the "...experience of being dominated by political and natural forces that far exceed our limited powers"; these elements "strike a chord of recognition with some of the existentialist writings that emerged in Europe following the Second World War."&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Desmond, "Blaise Pascal", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/pascal/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erich Fromm]] states that in modern capitalist societies, people develop a "...feeling of personal insignificance and powerlessness" due to "...economic recessions, global wars and terrorism." Fromm argues that in capitalist societies, the "...individual became subordinated to capitalist production and worked for profit's sake, for the development of new investment capital and for conspicuous spending." In making people "...work for extrapersonal ends," capitalism made people into a "servant to the very machine he built" and caused feelings of insignificance to arise.

==In religion==

[[Martin Luther]] believed that the solution to the feelings of insignificance felt by the common person "...was to accept individual insignificance, to submit, to give up individual will and strength and hope to become acceptable to God."&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm and "The Fear of Freedom.

Awe is defined in [[Robert Plutchik]]'s [[List_of_emotions#Plutchik.27s_wheel_of_emotions|Wheel of emotions]]&lt;ref name="Plutchik"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://americanscientist.org/articles/01articles/Plutchik.html |title=The Nature of Emotions |publisher=American Scientist |last=Plutchik |first=R |authorlink=Robert Plutchik |accessdate=14 April 2011 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010716082847/http://americanscientist.org/articles/01articles/Plutchik.html |archivedate=July 16, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a combination of [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]] and [[fear]]. One dictionary definition is "an overwhelming feeling of reverence, admiration, fear, etc., produced by that which is grand, sublime, extremely powerful, or the like: in awe of God; in awe of great political figures". In general awe is directed at objects considered to be more powerful than the subject, such as the breaking of huge waves on the base of a rocky cliff, the thundering roar of a massive waterfall, the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], the [[Grand Canyon]], or the vastness of open space in the cosmos.

In her column in Scientific American, [[Jennifer Ouellette]] referred to the vastness of the cosmos:&lt;ref&gt;In Praise of Insignificance
By Jennifer Ouellette | November 22, 2011. Available online at: http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/2011/11/22/in-praise-of-insignificance/. Accessed on Dec 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If one embraces an atheist worldview, it necessarily requires embracing, even celebrating, one's insignificance. It's a tall order, I know, when one is accustomed to being the center of attention. The universe existed in all its vastness before I was born, and it will exist and continue to evolve after I am gone. But knowing that doesn't make me feel bleak or hopeless. I find it strangely comforting.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In literary philosophy==
The concept of "insignificance" is also important to the literary philosophy of [[cosmicism]]. One of the prominent themes in cosmicism is the utter insignificance of humanity. [[H. P. Lovecraft]] believed that "the human race will disappear. Other races will appear and disappear in turn. The sky will become icy and void, pierced by the feeble light of half-dead stars. Which will also disappear. Everything will disappear."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Michel Houellebecq, ''[[H. P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life]]'' (1999), referenced in Andrew Riemer's [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/06/27/1056683892274.html "A nihilist's hope against hope"], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colin Wilson]] criticizes “the sense of defeat, or disaster, or futility, that seems to underlie so much...20th century literature", and its tendency "...to portray human existence as insignificant and futile." Wilson "...calls this affliction the "fallacy of insignificance", and as he explains in ''The Stature of Man'' this fallacy is unconsciously embedded in the psychology of the modern individual." Wilson argues that the "other-directed individual...is the typical person found in our modern society today and is a victim of the "fallacy of insignificance"." He claims that the "...other directed individual has been conditioned by society to lack self-confidence in their ability to achieve anything of real worth, and thus they conform to society to escape their feelings of unimportance and uselessness."&lt;ref&gt;The Stature of Man - Colin Wilson.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18790">'''Behavioral marital therapy''', sometimes called '''behavioral couples therapy''', has its origins in [[behaviorism]] and is a form of [[behavior therapy]]. The theory is rooted in [[social learning theory]] and [[behavior analysis]]. As a model, it is constantly being revised as new research presents.

==History==
Behavioral marital therapy started with simple research conducted on couples in the 1960s. Robert Weiss and Richard Stuart were the original authors of such research.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, J.P., Weiss, R.L. &amp; Birchler, G.R.(1975). A behavioral analysis of problem solving in distressed and nondistressed married and stranger dyads. ''Behavior Therapy, 6,'' 475–487.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, R.B.(1969). Operant-interpersonal treatment of marital discord. ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 33'', 675–682.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1970s Nathan Azrin published his concept of mutal reinforcement and reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;Azrin, NH, Naster, BJ, and Jone, R. (1973). Reciprocity counseling: A rapid learning-based procedure for marital counseling. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 11, 365–382.&lt;/ref&gt; Azrin stated that (1) human behavior is maintained by reinforcement on the person who performed the behavior (2) people have a tendency to treat others as they are treated and (3) mutual reinforcement accounts at least partially for concepts like friendships, joy, and love. Neil Jacobson pioneered the behavioral marital therapy approach. He published a book with Gayla Margolin, which launched a social learning model of couples therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson and Margolin (1979).''Marital therapy: Strategies based on social learning and behavior exchange principles.'' New York: Brunner/Mazel.&lt;/ref&gt; In this model of therapy, partners learn to be nicer to each other through behavioral exchange (contingency contracts), communicate better and improve their conflict-resolution skills. Early support came when Gottman found that as long as the ratio of positive to negative interactions remains at least five to one, the relationship is sturdy. When the ratio dips below there is a 94 percent chance that a couple will divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Gottman, J. M., &amp; Levenson, R. W. (1999). "What predicts change in marital interaction over time? A study of alternative models." ''[[Family Process (journal)|Family Process]]'', 38 (2), pp.143–158&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have found a role for exchanges as well.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, A.M. (1979). The quantity and quality of marital interaction related to marital satisfaction: A behavioral analysis. ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 12,'' 665–678&lt;/ref&gt;  Behavioral marital therapy model remains the most researched model of [[family therapy]] and was found to be effective for treating marital discord and depression in women.&lt;ref&gt;William O'Donohue and Kyle E. Ferguson (2006): Evidence-Based Practice in Psychology and Behavior Analysis. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 7(3)'' 335- 347 [http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the behavioral couples therapy model, in particular strategic use of the communication skills to reinforce drug abstinence and open dialogue about treatment,  were introduced as a method for getting drug abusing partners into treatment ''(see [[Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J.E., Milford, J.L and  Meyers, R.J. (2004). CRA and CRAFT: Behavioral Approaches to Treating Substance-Abusing Individuals. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 5.(4),''  391–402 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early research suggested that the components of behavioral marital therapy worked as predicted. The social exchange component led to increases in marital satisfaction in the short run. The communication training program led couples to communicate better and produced more long term changes in contingencies between couple members.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, N. S., &amp; Follette, W. C. (1985). Clinical significance of improvement resulting from two behavioral marital therapy components. ''Behavior Therapy, 16,'' 249–262.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disillusionment with the traditional model began with a study in which it was found that only 50% of couples responded to the therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen A, Atkins DC, Berns S, Wheeler J, Baucom DH, &amp; Simpson LE (2004) Traditional versus integrative behavioral couple therapy for significantly and chronically distressed married couples. ''J Consult Clin Psychol.72(2),'' 176–91&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, traditional couple therapy did not produce more significant outcomes compared to insight-oriented couple therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder DK &amp; Wills RM. (1989). Behavioral versus insight-oriented marital therapy: Effects on individual and interspousal functioning''.J Consult Clin Psychol. 57(1)'' 39–46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

Integrative behavioral couple therapy (IBCT) was developed by Neil S. Jacobson and Andrew Christensen.  The model represents a return to contextualism, functional analysis and Skinner's distinction between contingency shaped and rule governed behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, A., Jacobson, N.S. &amp; Babcock, J.C. (1995). Integrative behavioral couples therapy. In N.S. Jacobson &amp; A.S. Gurman (Eds.) Clinical Handbook for Couples Therapy (pp. 31–64). New York: Guildford.&lt;/ref&gt; Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy is "integrative" in at least two senses: First, it integrates the twin goals of acceptance and change as positive outcomes for couples in therapy. Couples who succeed in therapy usually make some concrete changes to accommodate the needs of the other but they also show greater emotional acceptance of the other. Second, IBCT integrates a variety of treatment strategies under a consistent behavioral theoretical framework. It is considered a third generation [[behavior therapy]] or sometimes called [[clinical behavior analysis]].

Both the integrative and traditional behavioral couples therapy models have origins primarily in [[behaviorism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cordova: (2003) Behavior Analysis and the Scientific Study of Couples. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 3 (4),'' 412 -425 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; While traditional behavioral couples therapy has more roots in [[social learning theory|social learning]] principles and the later model in Skinnerian behaviorism. The latter model draws heavily on the use of [[functional analysis (psychology)]] and the Skinnerian distinction between contingency shaped and rule governed behavior to balance acceptance and change in the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Cordova, J., and Eldridge, K. (2000). Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy An Acceptance-Based, Promising New Treatment for Couple Discord, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 68, 351–355.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapman and Compton: (2003) From Traditional Behavioral Couple Therapy to Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy: New Research Directions ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 4 (1),'' 17 -25 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
IBCT consists of two major phases, an evaluation/feedback phase and an active treatment phase. The first three sessions consist of an evaluation period where the therapist learns about the concerns of the couple. In the first session, the therapist usually sees both partners together, learns what brings the couple to therapy, and obtains a brief history of their relationship. The therapist may suggest couples read a self-help book during treatment that serves as a guideline for IBCT therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, A. &amp; Jacobson, N. S. (2000). ''Reconcilable Differences.'' New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Also during this first session, the therapist normally gives each partner some questionnaires to complete and bring to their individual sessions, which are the next two sessions. In these individual sessions, the therapist explores each partner's relationship concerns and individual history. In the fourth session, the therapist sees both partners together for the "feedback session." The therapist may gather some final information in the beginning of the session, but most of the session is devoted to feedback from the therapist, in which he or she describes the couple's difficulties and strengths and how therapy will try to assist the couple. A major part of the feedback session is the therapist's formulation of the couple's problems, a conceptualization of the major themes in the couple's struggles, the understandable reasons why the couple has these struggles, how their efforts to resolve the struggles so often fail, and how therapy can help. The couple actively participates in this feedback, giving their reactions, adding information, and correcting the therapist's impressions as needed.

After the feedback session, the couple can make an informed decision about whether the therapist and treatment seem right for them. Assuming they decide positively, then the active phase of treatment begins. Sessions at this point are almost always done jointly, with both members of the couple and the therapist. The focus is often on important recent incidents, positive or negative, that reflect their major theme or themes. For example, if a major theme concerned partners' difficulties in achieving emotional intimacy, the couple might discuss a recent incident in which they were able to achieve a sense of closeness with each other or an incident in which one or both reached out to the other but felt rebuffed. Similarly, if a major theme involved frequent struggles over decision-making, they might discuss a recent incident where they were able to reach agreement on a matter or an incident where they got into a negative, escalating conflict about an issue on which they disagreed. Upcoming incidents related to a couple's theme, such as a difficult, upcoming decision that the couple must make, and broader issues related to a couple's theme, such as how partners in a couple who struggles to achieve emotional intimacy react when their feelings are hurt, are also a focus of discussion. In these discussions, the therapist is often quite active, helping the partners communicate more openly, directly, and clearly, helping them identify the patterns that get them stuck, and assisting them in finding alternative ways of interacting.

The standard protocol for IBCT therapy is described in a treatment manual written for therapists.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, N.S. &amp; Christensen, A. (1996) ''Acceptance and change in couple therapy.'' New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; This standard protocol has been used in research on IBCT and includes 4 sessions for the assessment/feedback phase and an additional 20–22 sessions of active treatment. Typically sessions are conducted every week and last just short of an hour. Toward the end of therapy, sessions are often spaced more widely (e.g., every other week or longer). Thus, the typical course of therapy lasts between 6 and 12 months.

==Topics addressed==
While traditional behavioral couples therapy focused heavily on change,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, N. S., &amp; Follette, W. C. (1985). Clinical significance of improvement resulting from two behavioral marital therapy components. Behavior Therapy, 16, 249–262.&lt;/ref&gt; integrative couples therapy attempted to balance change and acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman and Compton: (2003) From Traditional Behavioral Couple Therapy to Integrative Behavioral Couple Therapy: New Research Directions ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 4 (1),'' 17 -25 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved through helping couples to better understand each other's learning history and to produce more contingency shaped changes in session and less rule governed changes for the couple. This is accomplished through therapist interventions such as turning the problem into something that happens to the couple. Some of the current research suggests that contingency shaped behavior is easier to maintain then rule governed behavior for couples.&lt;ref&gt;Mia Sevier, Kathleen Eldridge, Janice Jones, Brian D Doss, Andrew Christensen (2008). Observed communication and associated satisfaction during traditional and integrative behavioral couples therapy. ''Behavior Therapy, 39(2),'' 137–150&lt;/ref&gt; As to behavioral function, the greater the amount of escape /withdrawal behavior a couples members displays during demand situations the higher the amount of distress.&lt;ref&gt;Eldridge, K.A., Sevier, M. Jones, J., Atkins, D.C. &amp; Christensen, A. (2007). Demand-withdraw communication in severely distressed couples. Journal of Family Psychology, 21(2), 218–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrative behavioral couples therapy addresses topics such as intimacy in couples relationships&lt;ref&gt;Cordova, J. V., &amp; Scott, R. L. (2001). Intimacy: A behavioral interpretation. The Behavior Analyst, 24, 75–86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cordova, J. (2003).  Behavior Analysis and the Scientific Study of Couples.

The Behavior Analyst, 24, 213–226.&lt;/ref&gt;  and  forgiveness in couples.&lt;ref&gt;Cordova, J., Cautilli, J.D., Simon, C. &amp; Axelrod-Sabtig, R. (2006). Behavior Analysis of Forgiveness in Couples Therapy. '' IJBCT, 2.(2),''  192–208 [http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

A growing number of researchers are interested in the concept of [[behavioral momentum]] with couples. Couples seem to go through periods of ongoing improvement and other couples seem to go through periods of negative momentum. Theoretically, behaviorism has begun to focus more on romantic love.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Lev Dermer (2006): Towards Understanding The Meaning Of Affectionate Verbal Behavior;  Towards Creating Romantic Loving, ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 7.(4),''  Page 452 -480 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficacy compared to traditional behavioral couple therapy==
Integrative behavioral couples therapy seems to work slower in producing change initially but has led to a 71% improvement rate in couples.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen A, Atkins DC, Berns S, Wheeler J, Baucom DH, &amp; Simpson LE (2004) Traditional versus integrative behavioral couple therapy for significantly and chronically distressed married couples. J Consult Clin Psychol.72(2):176-91&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Integrative behavioral couples therapy does not produce as much change as traditional behavioral couples therapy but it does produce more acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Doss BD, Thum YM, Sevier M, Atkins DC, &amp; Christensen, A. (2005). Improving relationships: mechanisms of change in couple therapy. J Consult Clin Psychol. 73(4):624-33&lt;/ref&gt; At two years 69% of the Integrative behavioral couples therapy group appears to be doing better, while only 60% of the traditional group does better, while marital satisfaction was also in greater favor for the integrative behavioral couples therapy group.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen A, Atkins DC, Yi J, Baucom DH,  &amp; George WH. (2006). Couple and individual adjustment for 2 years following a randomized clinical trial comparing traditional versus integrative behavioral couple therapy.J Consult Clin Psychol. 74(6):1180–91&lt;/ref&gt; However, the traditional behavioral couples therapy group had a larger decline in negativity toward each other than did the integrative behavioral couples therapy group.&lt;ref&gt;Sevier M, Eldridge K, Jones J, Doss BD, &amp; Christensen A (2008). Observed communication and associations with satisfaction during traditional and integrative behavioral couple therapy.Behav Ther. 39(2):137-50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vs. traditional behavioral couples therapy after an affair==
Overall the state of the research of couples being treated specifically for marital [[infidelity]] is in its infancy. One study,  looked at 19 couples who had an affair. This study found that both traditional behavioral couples therapy and integrative behavioral couples therapy were effective in increasing intmacy after the affair was disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins,, D., Eldridge, K., Baucom, D. &amp; Christensen, A. (2005). Infidelity and behavioral couples therapy: Optimism in the face of betrayal. ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 73,'' 144–150.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors suggested that this is good news for couples. A greater reliance on behavioral conceptualizations of romantic love&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Lev Dermer (2006): Towards Understanding The Meaning Of Affectionate Verbal Behavior;  Towards Creating Romantic Loving. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 7.(4),''  Page 452-480&lt;/ref&gt;  [[intimacy]] and [[forgiveness]]&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, K. &amp; Baucom, D. (1998).

==Behavioral assessment of couples==

Behavior analysis uses direct observation to determine the areas for intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, A.M. (1979).

Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 42, 802–811.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional organizations==
The [[Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies]] (ABCT) has an annual conference where couple researchers and therapists can present their recent work in the field. The [[ABCT Couples Special Interest Group]] is part of ABCT and is composed of researchers whose focus is intimate relationships or clinicians whose focus is couple therapy.

The [[Association for Behavior Analysis]] International (ABA:I)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abainternational.org/ ABA:I]&lt;/ref&gt; has a special interest group in Behavioral Counseling which has many couples therapists. ABA:I has two conventions per year on in the U.S. and one Internationally. Couples researchers and therapists often present at these conferences.

The World Center for Behavior Analysis offers a certification in behavior therapy that covers Integrative Behavioral Couples Therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldcenterba.com/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718113444/http://worldcenterba.com/index.html |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3668">{{distinguish|Inner product}}

In [[mathematics]], the '''interior product''' ({{aka}} '''interior derivative''', '''interior multiplication''', '''inner multiplication''', '''inner derivative''', or '''inner derivation''') is a [[graded algebra|degree]] &amp;minus;1 [[antiderivation]] on the [[exterior algebra]] of [[differential form]]s on a [[smooth manifold]]. The interior product, named in opposition to the [[exterior product]], should not be confused with an [[inner product]]. The interior product ''ι''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;''ω'' is sometimes written as {{nowrap|''X'' ⨼ ''ω''}}.&lt;ref&gt;The character ⨼ is U+2A3C in [[Unicode]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

The interior product is defined to be the [[tensor contraction|contraction]] of a [[differential form]] with a [[vector field]].  Thus if ''X'' is a vector field on the [[manifold]] ''M'', then 
:&lt;math&gt;\iota_X\colon \Omega^p(M) \to \Omega^{p-1}(M)&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[Map (mathematics)|map]] which sends a ''p''-form ''ω'' to the (''p''&amp;minus;1)-form ''ι''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;''ω'' defined by the property that
:&lt;math&gt;( \iota_X\omega )(X_1,\ldots,X_{p-1})=\omega(X,X_1,\ldots,X_{p-1})&lt;/math&gt;
for any vector fields ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''−1&lt;/sub&gt;.

The interior product is the unique [[derivation (algebra)|antiderivation]] of degree &amp;minus;1 on the [[exterior algebra]] such that on one-forms ''α''
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\iota_X \alpha = \alpha(X) = \langle \alpha,X \rangle&lt;/math&gt;,
where {{nowrap|⟨ , ⟩}} is the [[duality pairing]] between ''α'' and the vector ''X''.  Explicitly, if ''β'' is a ''p''-form and γ is a ''q''-form, then
:&lt;math&gt; \iota_X(\beta\wedge\gamma) = (\iota_X\beta)\wedge\gamma+(-1)^p\beta\wedge(\iota_X\gamma). &lt;/math&gt;
The above relation says that the interior product obeys a graded [[Product rule|Leibniz rule]]. An operation satisfying linearity and a Leibniz rule is often called a derivative.

==Properties==
By antisymmetry of forms, 

:&lt;math&gt; \iota_X \iota_Y \omega = - \iota_Y \iota_X \omega &lt;/math&gt;

and so &lt;math&gt; \iota_X \circ \iota_X = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. This may be compared to the [[exterior derivative]] ''d'', which has the property {{nowrap|1=''d'' ∘ ''d'' = 0}}.

The interior product relates the [[exterior derivative]] and [[Lie derivative]] of differential forms by &lt;span id="Cartan formula"&gt;'''Cartan formula''' (a.k.a. '''Cartan identity''', '''Cartan homotopy formula'''&lt;ref&gt;Tu, Sec 20.5.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Cartan magic formula''')&lt;/span&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal L_X\omega = d(\iota_X \omega) + \iota_X d\omega. &lt;/math&gt;

This identity defines a duality between the exterior and interior derivatives. Cartan's identity is important in [[symplectic geometry]] and [[general relativity]]: see [[moment map]].&lt;ref&gt;There is another formula called "Cartan formula". See [[Steenrod algebra]].&lt;/ref&gt; Cartan homotopy formula is named after [[Élie Cartan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Is "Cartan's magic formula" due to Élie or Henri? | url=https://mathoverflow.net/q/39540 | accessdate=2018-06-25 | date=2010-09-21 |publisher=[[mathoverflow]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The interior product with respect to the commutator of two vector fields &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the identity
:&lt;math&gt; \iota_{[X,Y]}= \left[ \mathcal{L}_X, \iota_Y \right] . &lt;/math&gt;

According to some observers, ISIL emerged from the ideology of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], the first [[Ottoman Empire|post-Ottoman]] Islamist group dating back to the late 1920s in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hussain |first=Ghaffar |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/iraq-crisis-what-does-the-isis-caliphate-mean-for-global-jihadism-9573951.html |title=Iraq crisis: What does the Isis caliphate mean for global jihadism? |date=30 June 2014 |website=Independent |accessdate=6 July 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It adheres to global [[Jihadism|jihadist]] principles and follows the hard-line ideology of [[al-Qaeda]] and many other modern-day jihadist groups.{{r|ReutersHolmes_030214|ANS}} However, other sources trace the group's roots to [[Wahabbi movement|Wahhabism]].

According to ''[[The Economist]]'', dissidents in the former ISIL capital of [[Raqqa]] report that "all 12 of the judges who now run its court system ... are Saudis". Saudi practices also followed by the group include the establishment of [[Islamic religious police|religious police]] to root out "vice" and enforce attendance at [[salat]] prayers, the widespread use of capital punishment, and the destruction or re-purposing of any non-Sunni religious buildings.&lt;ref name="economist-behead"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Crime and punishment in Saudi Arabia: The other beheaders |magazine=The Economist |date=20 September 2014 |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21618918-possible-reasons-mysterious-surge-executions-other-beheaders |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Haykel]] has described ISIL leader [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi|Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's]] creed as "a kind of untamed Wahhabism".{{r|ISIS_NYT}} Senior Saudi religious leaders have issued statements condemning ISIL&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Staff writer |title='ISIS is enemy No. 1 of Islam,' says Saudi grand mufti |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/08/19/Saudi-mufti-ISIS-is-enemy-No-1-of-Islam-.html |accessdate=5 October 2017 |work=Al Arabiyah News English |date=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempting to distance the group from official Saudi religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Staff writer |title=Some Saudi clerics condemn Isil but preach intolerance |url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/some-saudi-clerics-condemn-isil-but-preach-intolerance-1.1383191 |accessdate=5 October 2017 |work=Gulf News |agency=Reuters |issue=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISIL aims to return to the early days of Islam, rejecting all [[Bid'ah|innovations]] in the religion, which it believes corrupts its original spirit. It condemns later caliphates and the [[Ottoman Empire]] for deviating from what it calls pure Islam, and seeks to revive the original Wahhabi project of the restoration of the caliphate governed by strict Salafist doctrine. Following Salafi-Wahhabi tradition, ISIL condemns the followers of secular law as disbelievers, putting the current Saudi Arabian government in that category.&lt;ref name=Wahhabism /&gt;

Salafists such as ISIL believe that only a legitimate authority can undertake the leadership of [[jihad]], and that the first priority over other areas of combat, such as fighting non-Muslim countries, is the purification of Islamic society. For example, ISIL regards the Palestinian Sunni group [[Hamas]] as apostates who have no legitimate authority to lead jihad and see fighting Hamas as the first step toward confrontation by ISIL with Israel.{{r|ISIS_NYT}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mamouri |first1=Ali |title=Why Islamic State has no sympathy for Hamas |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/07/islamic-state-fighting-hamas-priority-before-israel.html |date=29 July 2014 |work=Al-Monitor |accessdate=1 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801134410/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/07/islamic-state-fighting-hamas-priority-before-israel.html |archivedate=1 August 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamic eschatology ===
{{see also|Islamic eschatology}}

One difference between ISIL and other Islamist and jihadist movements, including [[al-Qaeda]], is the group's emphasis on [[Islamic eschatology|eschatology]] and [[apocalypticism]] – that is, a belief in a final [[Last Judgment#Islam|Day of Judgment]] by God, and specifically, a belief that the arrival of one known as Imam [[Mahdi]] is near. ISIL believes that it will defeat the army of "Rome" at the town of [[Dabiq, Syria|Dabiq]], in fulfilment of prophecy.&lt;ref name="what-isis-really-wants" /&gt; Following its interpretation of the [[Hadith of the Twelve Successors]], ISIL also believes that after al-Baghdadi there will be only four more legitimate caliphs.&lt;ref name="what-isis-really-wants" /&gt;

The noted scholar of militant Islamism [[Will McCants]] writes:

{{quote|text=References to the End Times fill Islamic State propaganda. It's a big selling point with foreign fighters, who want to travel to the lands where the final battles of the apocalypse will take place. The civil wars raging in those countries today [Iraq and Syria] lend credibility to the prophecies. The Islamic State has stoked the apocalyptic fire. [...] For Bin Laden's generation, the apocalypse wasn't a great recruiting pitch. Governments in the Middle East two decades ago were more stable, and sectarianism was more subdued. It was better to recruit by calling to arms against corruption and tyranny than against the Antichrist. Today, though, the apocalyptic recruiting pitch makes more sense than before. |first=William|last=McCants |source=''The ISIS Apocalypse: The History, Strategy, and Doomsday Vision of the Islamic State''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The ISIS Apocalypse: The History, Strategy, and Doomsday Vision of the Islamic State |last=McCants |first=William |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-250-08090-5 |location=New York |page=147 |url=https://www.amazon.com/The-ISIS-Apocalypse-Strategy-Doomsday/dp/1250080908}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Goals ===

Since at least 2004, a significant goal of the group has been the foundation of a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Islamic state]].&lt;ref name="Beauchamp14"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/cards/things-about-isis-you-need-to-know/isis-goal-theocracy |title=17 things about ISIS and Iraq you need to know |first=Zack |last=Beauchamp |date=2 September 2014 |website=Vox |accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dni.gov"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Abu Mohammad |title=Letter dated 9 July 2005 |url=http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/letter_in_english.pdf |accessdate=22 July 2014 |publisher=Office of the Director of National Intelligence |at=See page 2 onwards |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522153638/http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/letter_in_english.pdf |archivedate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, ISIL has sought to establish itself as a [[caliphate]], an Islamic state led by a group of religious authorities under a supreme leader – the [[caliph]] – who is believed to be the successor to Prophet [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name=Johnson14 /&gt; In June 2014, ISIL published a document in which it claimed to have traced the lineage of its leader al-Baghdadi back to Muhammad,&lt;ref name="Johnson14" /&gt; and upon proclaiming a new caliphate on 29 June, the group appointed al-Baghdadi as its caliph. As caliph, he demands the allegiance of all devout Muslims [[worldwide caliphate|worldwide]], according to Islamic jurisprudence (''[[fiqh]]'').&lt;ref name="aj140707"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/inside-story/articles/2014/7/7/isil-s-leader-emergesfromtheshadowswhoisabubakralbaghdadi.html |title=Who is the U.S. targeting in Iraq air strikes? |date=7 July 2014 |first=Laith |last=Kubba |publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISIL has detailed its goals in its ''[[Dabiq (magazine)|Dabiq]]'' magazine, saying it will continue to seize land and take over the entire Earth until its:

{{quote|text=Blessed flag...covers all eastern and western extents of the Earth, filling the world with the truth and justice of Islam and putting an end to the falsehood and tyranny of jahiliyyah [state of ignorance], even if America and its coalition despise such. |source=5th edition of ''Dabiq'', the Islamic State's English-language magazine&lt;ref name="Joscelyn"&gt;{{cite news |last=Joscelyn |first=Thomas |title=US counterterrorism efforts in Syria: A winning strategy? |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/09/us-counterterrorism-efforts-in-syria-a-winning-strategy.php |work=Long War Journal |date=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Strategy ===

Documents found after the death of Samir Abd Muhammad al-Khlifawi, a former colonel in the intelligence service of the [[Iraqi Air Force]] before the US invasion who had been described as "the strategic head" of ISIL, detailed planning for the ISIL takeover of northern Syria which made possible "the group's later advances into Iraq". Al-Khlifawi called for the infiltration of areas to be conquered with spies who would find out "as much as possible about the target towns: Who lived there, who was in charge, which families were religious, which Islamic school of religious jurisprudence they belonged to, how many mosques there were, who the imam was, how many wives and children he had and how old they were". Following this surveillance and espionage would come murder and kidnapping – "the elimination of every person who might have been a potential leader or opponent". In Raqqa, after rebel forces drove out the Assad regime and ISIL infiltrated the town, "first dozens and then hundreds of people disappeared".&lt;ref name=Reuter-4-18-2015&gt;{{cite news |last1=Reuter |first1=Christoph |date=18 April 2015 |title=The Terror Strategist: Secret Files Reveal the Structure of Islamic State |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/islamic-state-files-show-structure-of-islamist-terror-group-a-1029274.html |work=Der Spiegel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Security and intelligence expert Martin Reardon has described ISIL's purpose as being to psychologically "break" those under its control, "[...] so as to ensure their absolute allegiance through fear and intimidation," while generating, "[...]outright hate and vengeance" among its enemies.&lt;ref name=Reardon-6-7-15&gt;{{cite news |last1=Reardon |first1=Martin |title=ISIL and the management of savagery |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/07/isil-management-savagery-150705060914471.html |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jason Burke]], a journalist writing on [[Salafi jihadism]], has written that ISIL's goal is to "terrorize, mobilize [and] polarize".&lt;ref name=Gude-2015-3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jason |last=Burke |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/14/islamic-state-goes-global-paris-attacks |title=Islamic State 'Goes Global' with Paris Attacks |work=The Observer |date=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its efforts to terrorise are intended to intimidate civilian populations and force governments of the target enemy "to make rash decisions that they otherwise would not choose".

According to Iraqis, Syrians and analysts who study the group, almost all of ISIL's leaders—including the members of its military and security committees and the majority of its [[emir]]s and princes—are former Iraqi military and intelligence officers, specifically former members of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Ba'ath]] government who lost their jobs and pensions in the [[de-Ba'athification]] process after that regime was overthrown.&lt;ref name=Saddam&gt;{{cite news |last=Sly |first=Liz |title=How Saddam Hussein's former military officers and spies are controlling Isis |work=Independent |date=5 April 2015 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/how-saddam-husseins-former-military-officers-and-spies-are-controlling-isis-10156610.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Liz |last=Sly |date=4 April 2015 |title=The hidden hand behind the Islamic State militants?

The group closed the gates of the smaller Nuaimiyah dam in Fallujah in April 2014, flooding the surrounding regions, while cutting the water supply to the [[Shia]]-dominated south. Around 12,000 families lost their homes and 200&amp;nbsp;km² of villages and fields were either flooded or dried up. The economy of the region also suffered with destruction of cropland and electricity shortages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Water and Violence Link: Crisis of Survival in the Middle East |url=http://strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/63948150123-web.pdf |publisher=Strategic Foresight |location=Mumbai, India |date=December 2014 |isbn=978-81-88262-24-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Battle of Mosul (2016–17)|Battle of Mosul]] it was reported that commercially available quadcopters and drones were being used by ISIL as surveillance and weapons delivery platforms using extemporised cradles to drop grenades and other explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://defense-update.com/20161012_drone_attacks.html |title=Weaponized Mini-Drones Entering the Fight |last=Eshel |first=Tamir |date=12 October 2016 |website=[[Defense Update]] |access-date=25 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISIL drone facility became a target of Royal Air Force strike aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://defense-update.com/20170117_drones_attacked.html |title=RAF Strikes Daesh Drone Facility in Mosul |last=Eshel |first=Tamir |date=17 January 2017 |website=[[Defense Update]] |access-date=25 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-combatant recruits ===

Although ISIL attracts followers from different parts of the world by promoting the image of holy war, not all of its recruits end up in combatant roles. There have been several cases of new recruits expecting to be ''[[mujihadeen|mujahideen]]'' who have returned from Syria disappointed by the everyday jobs that were assigned to them, such as drawing water or cleaning toilets, or by the ban imposed on use of mobile phones during military training sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon |last=Tomlinson |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2855780/Indian-IS-recruit-goes-home-having-clean-toilets.html |title='ISIS made me clean the toilets... and my iPod didn't work': How disenchanted Islamic fanatics are returning home because jihad isn't as glamorous as they hoped |date=1 December 2014 |accessdate=22 January 2015 |location=London |work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women ===
ISIL publishes material directed at women. Although women are not allowed to take up arms, media groups encourage them to play supportive roles within ISIL, such as providing first aid, cooking, nursing and sewing skills, in order to become "good wives of jihad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-now-targeting-women-with-guides-on-how-to-be-the-ultimate-wives-of-jihad-9830562.html |title=Isis now targeting women with guides on how to be the 'ultimate wives of jihad' |date=31 October 2014 |accessdate=22 January 2015 |location=London |work=Independent |first=Heather |last=Saul}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Until 2016, women were generally confined to a "women's house" upon arrival which they were unallowed to leave. These houses were often small, dirty and infested with vermin and food supplyt was scarce. There they remained until they either had found a husband, or the husband they had arrived with had completed his training.After being allowed to leave the confinement, women still generally spent most of their days indoors where their lives are devoted to caring for their husbands and the vast majority of women in the conflict area have children. Mothers play an important role passing on ISIS ideology to their children. Widows are encouraged to remarry.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://english.aivd.nl/publications/publications/2017/12/14/publication-jihadist-women-a-threat-not-to-be-underestimated|title=Jihadist women, a threat not to be underestimated - Publication - pdf|last=Koninkrijksrelaties|first=Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en|date=2017-12-14|website=|publisher=[[AIVD]]|page=6|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a document entitled ''Women in the Islamic State: Manifesto and Case Study'' released by the media wing of ISIL's all-female [[Al-Khansaa Brigade|Al-Khanssaa Brigade]], emphasis is given to the paramount importance of marriage and motherhood (as early as nine years old). Women should live a life of "sedentariness", fulfilling her "divine duty of motherhood" at home, with a few exceptions like teachers and doctors.&lt;ref name="imsorfw"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Abdul-Alim |first1=Jamaal |title=ISIS 'Manifesto' Spells Out Role for Women |magazine=The Atlantic |date=8 March 2015 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/03/isis-manifesto-spells-out-role-for-women/387049/ |accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quilliam-women"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Winter |first1=Charlie |title=QUILLIAM Translation and Analysis of Islamic State Manifesto on Jihadist Brides |url=http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/press/quilliam-translation-and-analysis-of-islamic-state-manifesto-on-jihadist-brides/ |publisher=Quilliam Foundation |accessdate=23 November 2015 |date=5 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119055307/http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/press/quilliam-translation-and-analysis-of-islamic-state-manifesto-on-jihadist-brides/ |archivedate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equality for women is opposed, as is education on non-religious subjects, the "worthless worldly sciences".&lt;ref name="quilliam-women" /&gt;

====Traditional media====
In November 2006, shortly after the group's rebranding as the "Islamic State of Iraq", it established the Al-Furqan Foundation for Media Production, which produces CDs, DVDs, posters, pamphlets, and web-related propaganda products and official statements.&lt;ref name="LWJMmedia"&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Roggio |title=US targets al Qaeda's al Furqan media wing in Iraq |work=Long War Journal |date=28 October 2007 |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2007/10/us_targets_al_qaedas.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began to expand its media presence in 2013, with the formation of a second media wing, Al-I'tisam Media Foundation, in March&lt;ref name="Bilger 2014 p1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bilger|2014|p=1}}.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jihadologymedia"&gt;{{cite web |last=Zelin |first=Aaron Y. |title=New statement from the Global Islamic Media Front: Announcement on the Publishing of al-I'tiṣām Media Foundation – A Subsidiary of the Islamic State of Iraq – It Will Be Released Via GIMF |url=http://jihadology.net/2013/03/08/new-statement-from-the-global-islamic-media-front-announcement-on-the-publishing-of-al-iti%E1%B9%A3am-media-foundation-a-subsidiary-of-the-islamic-state-of-iraq-it-will-be-released-via-gimf/ |work=Jihadology |date=8 March 2013 |accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ajnad Foundation for Media Production, specialising in [[nasheed]]s and audio content, in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zelin |first=Aaron Y. |url=http://jihadology.net/2013/08/20/new-statement-from-the-islamic-state-of-iraq-and-al-sham-announcing-ajnad-foundation-for-media-production/ |title=New statement from the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Shām: "Announcing Ajnād Foundation For Media Production" |work=Jihadology |date=20 August 2013 |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-2014, ISIL established the Al Hayat Media Center, which targets Western audiences and produces material in English, German, Russian and French.&lt;ref name="FreeBeaconMedia"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gertz |first=Bill |title=New Al Qaeda Group Produces Recruitment Material for Americans, Westerners |url=http://freebeacon.com/national-security/new-al-qaeda-group-produces-recruitment-material-for-americans-westerners/ |work=The Washington Free Beacon |date=13 June 2014 |accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MEMRIMedia"&gt;{{cite web |title=ISIS Declares Islamic Caliphate, Appoints Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi As 'Caliph', Declares All Muslims Must Pledge Allegiance To Him |url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/8049.htm |publisher=MEMRI |date=30 June 2014 |accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ISIL announced its expansion to other countries in November 2014 it established media departments for the new branches, and its media apparatus ensured that the new branches follow the same models it uses in Iraq and Syria.&lt;ref name=wapo28jan&gt;{{cite news |title=The Islamic State's model |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/01/28/the-islamic-states-model/ |accessdate=30 March 2015 |work=The Washington Post |date=28 January 2015 |first=Aaron Y. |last=Zelin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then FBI Director [[James Comey]] said that ISIL's "propaganda is unusually slick," noting that, "They are broadcasting... in something like 23 languages".&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sullivan |first=Kevin |date=8 December 2014 |title=Three American teens, recruited online, are caught trying to join the Islamic State |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/three-american-teens-recruited-online-are-caught-trying-to-join-the-islamic-state/2014/12/08/8022e6c4-7afb-11e4-84d4-7c896b90abdc_story.html |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, al-Hayat began publishing a digital magazine called ''[[Dabiq (magazine)|Dabiq]]'', in a number of different languages including English. According to the magazine, its name is taken from the town of [[Dabiq (town)|Dabiq]] in northern Syria, which is mentioned in a [[hadith]] about [[Islamic eschatology|Armageddon]].&lt;ref name="JamestownDabiq"&gt;{{cite web |title=Dabiq: What Islamic State's New Magazine Tells Us about Their Strategic Direction, Recruitment Patterns and Guerrilla Doctrine |url=http://www.jamestown.org/programs/tm/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=42702&amp;cHash=0efbd71af77fb92c064b9403dc8ea838 |publisher=The Jamestown Foundation |date=1 August 2014 |accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Hayat also began publishing other digital magazines, including the Turkish language ''[[Konstantiniyye (magazine)|Konstantiniyye]]'', the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman]] word for Istanbul,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Akkoc |first=Raziye |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/islamic-state/11926022/Ankara-bombings-Islamic-State-is-main-suspect-says-Turkish-PM-Ahmet-Davutoglu.html |title=Ankara bombings: Islamic State is main suspect, says Turkish PM Ahmet Davutoglu |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=12 October 2015 |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Isabel |last=Hunter |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/suruc-bombings-turkish-president-accused-of-not-doing-enough-to-help-kurds-fight-isis-threat-across-10408839.html |title=Suruc bombings: Turkish President accused of not doing enough to help Kurds fight Isis threat across its border in Syria |work=Independent |date=22 July 2015 |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the French language ''[[Dar al-Islam (magazine)|Dar al-Islam]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jihadists Release First Issue of Pro-IS French Magazine "Dar al-Islam" |publisher=SITE Intelligence Group |date=22 December 2014 |accessdate=31 March 2016 |url=https://ent.siteintelgroup.com/Periodicals/jihadists-release-first-issue-of-pro-is-french-magazine-dar-al-islam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late 2016, these magazines had apparently all been discontinued, with Al-Hayat's material being consolidated into a new magazine called ''[[Rumiyah (magazine)|Rumiyah]]'' (Arabic for Rome).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/ISW%20The%20Virtual%20Caliphate%20Gambhir%202016.pdf |title=The Virtual Caliphate: ISIS'S Information Warfare |publisher=Institute for the Study of War|access-date=7 February 2017 |quote=As of late 2016, Rumiyah has apparently supplanted other internationally oriented publications, as al-Hayat has ceased publishing them}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social media ====
{{Main|Use of social media by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant}}

ISIL's use of [[social media]] has been described by one expert as "probably more sophisticated than [that of] most US companies".&lt;ref name="ft-20140617" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlantic socmedia"&gt;{{cite web |last=Berger |first=J.

The group is known for releasing videos and photographs of executions of prisoners, whether beheadings, shootings, caged prisoners being burnt alive or submerged gradually until drowned.&lt;ref name=cnn-12-8-15&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lee |first1=Ian |last2=Hanna |first2=Jason |title=Croatian ISIS captive reportedly beheaded |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/12/middleeast/isis-croatian-hostage/ |accessdate=12 August 2015 |publisher=CNN |date=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Abdel Bari Atwan]] described ISIL's media content as part of a "systematically applied policy". The escalating violence of its killings "guarantees" the attention of the media and public.&lt;ref name=NYRoB-7-9-2015 /&gt;

Along with images of brutality, ISIL presents itself as "an emotionally attractive place where people 'belong', where everyone is a 'brother' or 'sister'". The "most potent psychological pitch" of ISIL media is the promise of heavenly reward to dead jihadist fighters. Frequently posted in their media are dead jihadists' smiling faces, the ISIL 'salute' of a 'right-hand index finger pointing heavenward', and testimonies of happy widows.&lt;ref name=NYRoB-7-9-2015 /&gt; ISIL has also attempted to present a more "rational argument" in a series of videos hosted by the kidnapped journalist [[John Cantlie]]. In one video, various current and former US officials were quoted, such as the then US President [[Barack Obama]] and former [[CIA]] Officer [[Michael Scheuer]].&lt;ref name=nydailynews-2014-09-23&gt;{{cite news |last1=Walsh |first1=Michael |title=ISIS releases second 'lecture video' of British hostage John Cantlie |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/isis-releases-lecture-video-british-hostage-john-cantlie-article-1.1949195 |accessdate=6 October 2014 |work=Daily News |location=New York |date=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has encouraged sympathisers to initiate [[Vehicle-ramming attack|vehicle-ramming]] and [[Stabbing as a terrorist tactic|attacks]] worldwide.&lt;ref name=AttackingTheWest&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Thomas |last1=Hegghammer |first2=Petter |last2=Nesser |title=Assessing the Islamic State's Commitment to Attacking the West |work=Perspectives on Terrorism |publisher=Terrorism Research Initiative |volume=9 |issue=4 |date=9 July 2015 |issn=2334-3745 |url=http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finances ===
{{Main|Finances of ISIL}}
{{See also|Oil production and smuggling in ISIL}}

According to a 2015 study by the [[Financial Action Task Force]], ISIL's five primary sources of revenue are as follows (listed in order of significance):
* proceeds from the occupation of territory (including control of banks, petroleum reservoirs, taxation, extortion, and robbery of economic assets)
* kidnapping for ransom&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34312450 |title=Inside the Islamic State kidnap machine |date=22 September 2015 |work=BBC News|access-date=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* donations from Saudi Arabia and Gulf states, often disguised as meant for "humanitarian charity"
* material support provided by foreign fighters
* fundraising through modern communication networks&lt;ref name = FATF&gt;{{cite news |title=Financing of the Terrorist Organisation Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant |url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/Financing-of-the-terrorist-organisation-ISIL.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=19 April 2015 |publisher=Financial Action Task Force |date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, ISIL has produced annual reports giving numerical information on its operations, somewhat in the style of corporate reports, seemingly in a bid to encourage potential donors.&lt;ref name="ft-20140617" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/6/24/5834068/the-iraqi-rebels-make-annual-reports-with-infographics-we-translated |title=The surreal infographics ISIS is producing, translated |date=24 July 2014 |publisher=Vox |last1=Matthews |first1=Dylan |accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[RAND Corporation]] analysed ISIL's funding sources from documents captured between 2005 and 2010.&lt;ref name="ISIfunding" /&gt; It found that outside donations amounted to only 5% of the group's operating budgets,&lt;ref name="ISIfunding" /&gt; and that cells inside Iraq were required to send up to 20% of the income generated from kidnapping, extortion rackets and other activities to the next level of the group's leadership, which would then redistribute the funds to provincial or local cells that were in difficulties or needed money to conduct attacks.&lt;ref name="ISIfunding"&gt;{{cite news |last=Allam |first=Hannah |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/06/23/231223/records-show-how-iraqi-extremists.html |title=Records show how Iraqi extremists withstood U.S. anti-terror efforts |publisher=McClatchy News |date=23 June 2014 |accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, RAND estimated that ISIL finances from its largest source of income — oil revenues and the taxes it extracts from people under its control — had fallen from about $1.9 billion in 2014 to $870 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/12/opinion/man-without-an-isis-plan.html |title=Man Without an ISIS Plan |last=The Editorial Board |date=12 March 2017 |work=The New York Times|access-date=13 March 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was founded in 1999 by Jordanian [[Salafist jihadism|Salafi jihadist]] [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] under the name ''[[Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad|Jamāʻat al-Tawḥīd wa-al-Jihād]]'' ({{Literal translation|"The Organisation of Monotheism and Jihad"}}).&lt;ref name="winepJune14" /&gt; In a letter published by the Coalition in February 2004, Zarqawi wrote that jihadis should use bombings to start an open sectarian war so that Sunnis from the Islamic world would mobilize against assassinations carried out by Shia, specifically the Badr Brigade, against Ba'athists and Sunnis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/nea/rls/31694.htm "Zarqawi Letter"] ''State Dept. archives''&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel Derek Harvey told Reuters that "the U.S. military detained Badr assassination teams possessing target lists of Sunni officers and pilots in 2003 and 2004 but did not hold them. Harvey said his superiors told him that 'this stuff had to play itself out' – implying that revenge attacks by returning Shi'ite groups were to be expected."&lt;ref&gt;Ned Parker, [https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/mideast-crisis-iraq-militias/ "Torture by Iraqi militias: The report Washington did not want you to see"] Reuters, 14 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Jerry Burke, an adviser to the Iraqi Interior Ministry, said that in 2005 a plan from him and several colleagues to surveil and stop suspected Badr Brigade death squads in the special police forces was rejected when it got to an American Flag (General) Officer.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Wing, [http://musingsoniraq.blogspot.com/2012/02/from-bad-to-worse-how-militias-moved.html "Part two of an interview with Jerry Burke] ''Musings on Iraq'', 13 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] by Western forces, al-Zarqawi and ''Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad'' achieved notoriety in the early stages of the [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|Iraqi insurgency]] for their [[suicide attack]]s on [[Shia Islam|Shia]] mosques, civilians, Iraqi government institutions and Italian soldiers of the US-led '[[Multi-National Force – Iraq|Multi-National Force]]'.

In January 2006, AQI joined with several smaller Iraqi Sunni insurgent groups under an umbrella organisation called the [[Mujahideen Shura Council (Iraq)|Mujahideen Shura Council]] (MSC). According to counterterrorism researcher Brian Fishman, the merger was an attempt to give the group a more Iraqi flavour, and perhaps to distance al-Qaeda from some of al-Zarqawi's tactical errors, such as the [[2005 Amman bombings|2005 bombings]] by AQI of three hotels in Amman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fishman|2008|pp=48–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 June 2006, a US airstrike killed al-Zarqawi, who was succeeded as leader of the group by the Egyptian militant [[Abu Ayyub al-Masri]].&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Al-Qaeda in Iraq names new head |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5073092.stm |work=BBC News|date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al Masri"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tran |first=Mark |title=Al-Qaida in Iraq leader believed dead |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/01/iraq.alqaida |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fishman 2008 49–50"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fishman|2008|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Syrian Civil War ====
In March 2011, protests began in Syria against the Syrian government of [[Bashar al-Assad]]. In the following months, violence between demonstrators and security forces led to a gradual militarisation of the conflict.&lt;ref name="bbc14March14"&gt;{{cite web |title=Syria: The story of the conflict |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26116868 |date=14 March 2014 |accessdate=22 August 2014 |work=BBC News|first=Rania |last=Abouzeid}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, following the outbreak of the [[Syrian Civil War]], al-Baghdadi began sending Syrian and Iraqi ISI members experienced in [[guerilla warfare]] across the border into Syria to establish an organisation there. Under the name ''{{transl|ar|Jabhat an-Nuṣrah li-Ahli ash-Shām}}'' (or [[al-Nusra Front]]), it established a large presence in Sunni-majority [[Raqqa Governorate|Raqqa]], [[Idlib Governorate|Idlib]], [[Deir ez-Zor Governorate|Deir ez-Zor]], and [[Aleppo Governorate|Aleppo]] provinces.

Meanwhile, the ISIL campaign to free its imprisoned members culminated in simultaneous raids on [[Taji]] and [[Abu Ghraib prison|Abu Ghraib]] prisons in July 2013, freeing more than 500 prisoners, many of them veterans of the [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|Iraqi insurgency]].&lt;ref name="iswSeptember13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters23July13"&gt;{{cite news |title=Al Qaeda says it freed 500 inmates in Iraq jail-break |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/23/us-iraq-violence-alqaeda-idUSBRE96M0C720130723 |agency=Reuters |date=23 July 2013 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, al-Zawahiri ordered the disbanding of ISIL, putting al-Nusra Front in charge of jihadist efforts in Syria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zawahiri disbands main Qaeda faction in Syria |url=http://dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2013/Nov-08/237219-zawahiri-disbands-main-qaeda-faction-in-syria-jazeera.ashx |accessdate=8 November 2013 |work=The Daily Star |location=Beirut, Lebanon |date=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but al-Baghdadi rejected al-Zawahiri's order,&lt;ref name="aljazeera150613" /&gt; and his group continued to operate in Syria. In February 2014, after an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda publicly disavowed any relations with ISIL.&lt;ref name="AlQaedaTiesEnd" /&gt;

According to journalist Sarah Birke, there are "significant differences" between al-Nusra Front and ISIL. While al-Nusra actively calls for the overthrow of the Assad government, ISIL "tends to be more focused on establishing its own rule on conquered territory". ISIL is "far more ruthless" in building an Islamic state, "carrying out sectarian attacks and imposing sharia law immediately". While al-Nusra has a "large contingent of foreign fighters", it is seen as a home-grown group by many Syrians; by contrast, ISIL fighters have been described as "foreign 'occupiers'" by many Syrian refugees.&lt;ref name="birke3"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Birke |first=Sarah |title=How al-Qaeda Changed the Syrian War |magazine=New York Review of Books |date=27 December 2013 |url=http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/dec/27/how-al-qaeda-changed-syrian-war/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign fighters in Syria include Russian-speaking jihadists who were part of [[Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar]] (JMA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journal-neo.org/2014/01/18/rus-rost-mezhdunarodno-terroristicheskoj-ugrozy-s-territorii-sirii/ |title=Growth of International Terrorist Threat from Syria |first=Vladimir |last=Platov |journal=New Eastern Outlook |date=18 January 2014 |accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, [[Abu Omar al-Shishani]], leader of the [[Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar]] (JMA), swore an [[Bay'at|oath of allegiance]] to al-Baghdadi;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Thomas |last=Joscelyn |title=Chechen-led group swears allegiance to head of Islamic State of Iraq and Sham |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2013/11/muhajireen_army_swea.php |date=27 November 2013 |accessdate=13 July 2014 |work=Long War Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; the group then split between those who followed al-Shishani in joining ISIL and those who continued to operate independently in the JMA under new leadership.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25151104 |title=Syria crisis: Omar Shishani, Chechen jihadist leader |work=BBC News|date=3 December 2013 |accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mass killings ====
On 30 August 2016, a survey conducted by the [[Associated Press]] found that around 72 mass graves have been discovered in areas that have been liberated from ISIL control. In total, these mass graves contain the bodies of approximately 15,000 people killed by ISIL. The report stated that the mass graves were evidence of genocides conducted by ISIL in the region, including the [[genocide of Yazidis by ISIL|genocide of Yazidis]]. Seventeen graves were discovered in Syria, with the rest being found in Iraq. At least 16 of the graves in Iraq contained remains that were not counted, as they are located in dangerous conflict zones. Instead, the number of dead in these graves has been estimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Forces in Iraq and Syria discovers 72 mass graves in areas freed from ISIS |publisher=Iraqi News |date=30 August 2016 |url=http://www.iraqinews.com/iraq-war/forces-in-iraq-and-syria-discovers-72-mass-graves-areas-freed-from-isis/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November 2018, a [[United Nations]] report revealed over 200 mass graves of thousands of ISIL's victims were discovered. The grave sites, which may contain up to 12,000 bodies, were found in the northern and western Iraqi provinces of [[Nineveh Governorate|Nineveh]], [[Kirkuk Governorate|Kirkuk]], [[Saladin Governorate|Salah al-Din]] and [[Al Anbar Governorate|Anbar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/06/middleeast/mass-graves-isis-un-intl/index.html|title=200 mass graves of thousands of ISIS victims found|date=6 November 2018|work=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International criticism ===

The group has attracted widespread criticism internationally for its extremism, from governments and international bodies such as the [[United Nations]] and [[Amnesty International]]. On 24 September 2014, [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-Moon]] stated: "As Muslim leaders around the world have said, groups like ISIL – or Da'ish – have nothing to do with [[Islam]], and they certainly do not represent a state. They should more fittingly be called the 'Un-Islamic Non-State'."&lt;ref name=BanKiMoonUnIslamic&gt;{{cite web |author=Ban Ki-Moon |title=Secretary-General's remarks to Security Council High-Level Summit on Foreign Terrorist Fighters |url=https://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=8040 |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=18 November 2014 |date=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISIL has been classified a [[List of designated terrorist organizations|terrorist organisation]] by the United Nations, the European Union and its member states, the United States, Russia, India, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and many other countries (see {{see section||Classification}}). Over 60 countries are directly or indirectly waging war against ISIL (see {{see section||Countries and groups at war with ISIL}}). The group was described as a [[cult]] in a [[Huffington Post]] column by notable cult authority [[Steven Hassan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hassan |first1=Steven |title=ISIS Is a Cult That Uses Terrorism: A Fresh New Strategy |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-hassan/isis-is-a-cult-that-uses-_b_6023890.html |work=The World Post |accessdate=10 November 2014 |date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamic criticism ===
{{See also|Khawarij}}
Around the world, [[Islamic religious leaders]] have overwhelmingly condemned ISIL's ideology and actions, arguing that the group has strayed from the path of true Islam and that its actions do not reflect the religion's real teachings or virtues.&lt;ref name="ns10Mar2015"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Hasan |first=Mehdi |authorlink=Medhi Hasan |date=10 March 2015 |title=Mehdi Hasan: How Islamic is Islamic State? |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/world-affairs/2015/03/mehdi-hasan-how-islamic-islamic-state |work=[[New Statesman]] |accessdate=7 July 2015 |quote=Consider the various statements of Muslim groups such as the Organisation of Islamic Co-operation, representing 57 countries (Isis has "nothing to do with Islam"); the Islamic Society of North America (Isis's actions are "in no way representative of what Islam actually teaches"); al-Azhar University in Cairo, the most prestigious seat of learning in the Sunni Muslim world (Isis is acting "under the guise of this holy religion ... in an attempt to export their false Islam"); and even Saudi Arabia's Salafist Grand Mufti, Abdul Aziz al ash-Sheikh (Isis is "the number-one enemy of Islam").}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extremism within Islam goes back to the 7th century, to the [[Khawarij]]es. From their essentially political position, the Kharijites developed extreme doctrines which set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shia Muslims. They were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to [[takfir]], whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed worthy of death.&lt;ref name="al-Yaqoubi-[kha]"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Al-Yaqoubi |first=Muhammad |authorlink=Muhammad al-Yaqoubi |year=2015 |title=[[Refuting ISIS: A Rebuttal Of Its Religious And Ideological Foundations]] |pages=xvii–xviii |publisher=Sacred Knowledge |isbn=978-1-908224-12-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SheemaKhan&gt;{{cite news |first=Sheema |last=Khan |date=29 September 2014 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/another-battle-with-islams-true-believers/article20802390/ |title=Another battle with Islam's 'true believers' |work=The Globe and Mail |location=Toronto, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first=Usama |last=Hasan |title=The Balance of Islam in Challenging Extremism |url=http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |publisher=Quilliam Foundation |date=July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802045255/http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |archivedate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/fruits-of-the-tree-of-extremism |title=Imam Mohamad Jebara: Fruits of the tree of extremism |first=Mohamad |last=Jebara |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have also described the group not as Sunnis, but as Khawarij.&lt;ref name=SheemaKhan /&gt;&lt;ref name="al-Yaqoubi2|xvii-xviii+p.8"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Al-Yaqoubi |first=Muhammad |authorlink=Muhammad al-Yaqoubi |year=2015 |title=[[Refuting ISIS: A Rebuttal Of Its Religious And Ideological Foundations]] |pages=xvii–xviii |publisher=Sacred Knowledge |isbn=978-1-908224-12-5}} See also p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Sunni critics, including [[Salafi movement|Salafi]] and jihadist [[muftis]] such as [[Adnan al-Aroor]] and [[Abu Basir al-Tartusi]], say that ISIL and related terrorist groups are not Sunnis, but are instead modern-day Kharijites (Muslims who have stepped outside the mainstream of Islam) serving an imperial anti-Islamic agenda.&lt;ref name="econ140906"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21615634-sunni-religious-authorities-turn-against-islamic-state-slow-backlash |title=The slow backlash – Sunni religious authorities turn against Islamic State |date=6 September 2014 |newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISIL has received severe criticism from Muslim religious scholars and theologians. In late August 2014, the [[Grand Mufti]] of Saudi Arabia, [[Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al ash-Sheikh]], condemned ISIL and [[al-Qaeda]] saying, "Extremist and militant ideas and terrorism which spread decay on Earth, destroying human civilization, are not in any way part of Islam, but are enemy number one of Islam, and Muslims are their first victims".&lt;ref name=SaudiGrandMuftiCondemn&gt;{{cite news |title=Saudi Arabia's Grand Mufti denounces Islamic State group as un-Islamic |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2014/08/25/saudi-arabias-grand-mufti-denounces-islamic-state-group-as-un-islamic/ |agency=Reuters |accessdate=18 November 2014 |date=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late September 2014, 126 Sunni [[imams]] and Islamic scholars—primarily [[Sufism|Sufi]]&lt;ref name=MM141001&gt;{{cite web |url=http://muslimmatters.org/2014/10/01/muslim-scholars-letter-to-al-baghdadi-of-isis-or-isil-a-missed-opportunity/ |title=Muslim Scholars Letter to al-Baghdadi of ISIS or ISIL – A Missed Opportunity |date=1 October 2014 |first=Amad |last=Shaikh |work=Muslim Matters |accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;—from around the Muslim world signed an [[open letter]] to the Islamic State's leader al-Baghdadi, explicitly rejecting and refuting his group's interpretations of Islamic scriptures, the [[Quran]] and [[hadith]], which it used in order to justify its actions.&lt;ref name="huffpost-bagh-openlet"&gt;{{cite news |title=Muslim Scholars Release Open Letter to Islamic State Meticulously Blasting Its Ideology |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/24/muslim-scholars-islamic-state_n_5878038.html |work=HuffPost |date=24 September 2013 |first=Lauren |last=Markoe |agency=Religious News Service |accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=christianpost-2014-09-25&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Samuel |title=International Coalition of Muslim Scholars Refute ISIS' Religious Arguments in Open Letter to al-Baghdadi |url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/international-coalition-of-muslim-scholars-refute-isis-religious-arguments-in-open-letter-to-al-baghdadi-127032/ |accessdate=18 October 2014 |work=The Christian Post |date=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[You] have misinterpreted Islam into a religion of harshness, brutality, torture and murder ... this is a great wrong and an offence to Islam, to Muslims and to the entire world", the letter states.&lt;ref name=OpenLetToAlBagh /&gt; It rebukes the Islamic State for its killing of prisoners, describing the killings as "heinous [[war crime]]s" and its persecution of the [[Yazidis]] of Iraq as "abominable".

According to ''The New York Times'', "All of the most influential jihadist theorists are criticising the Islamic State as deviant, calling its self-proclaimed caliphate null and void" and they have denounced it for its beheadings of journalists and aid workers.{{r|ISIS_NYT}} ISIL is widely denounced by a broad range of Islamic clerics, including al-Qaeda-oriented clerics and Saudi clerics.{{r|HuffPost_Wahhabi|ISIS_NYT}} [[Muhammad al-Yaqoubi]] states, "It is enough of a proof of the extreme ideology of ISIS that the top leaders of Salafi-Jihadism have disclaimed it."&lt;ref name="al-Yaqoubi"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Al-Yaqoubi |first=Muhammad |authorlink=Muhammad al-Yaqoubi |year=2015 |title=[[Refuting ISIS: A Rebuttal Of Its Religious And Ideological Foundations]] |page=19 |publisher=Sacred Knowledge |isbn=978-1-908224-12-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{anchor|Khawarij}} Other critics of ISIL's brand of Sunni Islam include Salafists who previously publicly supported jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda: for example, the Saudi government official [[Saleh Al-Fawzan]], known for his extremist views, who claims that ISIL is a creation of "Zionists, Crusaders and Safavids", and the Jordanian-Palestinian writer [[Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi]], the former spiritual mentor to [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], who was released from prison in Jordan in June 2014 and accused ISIL of driving a wedge between Muslims.&lt;ref name="econ140906" /&gt;

An [[Islamic Front (Syria)|Islamic Front]] [[sharia]] court judge in Aleppo, Mohamed Najeeb Bannan, stated: "The legal reference is the Islamic Sharia. The cases are different, from robberies to drug use, to moral crimes. It's our duty to look at any crime that comes to us... After the regime has fallen, we believe that the Muslim majority in Syria will ask for an Islamic state. Of course, it's very important to point out that some say the Islamic Sharia will cut off people's hands and heads, but it only applies to criminals. And to start off by killing, crucifying etc. That is not correct at all." In response to being asked what the difference between the Islamic Front's and ISIL's version of sharia would be, he said, "One of their mistakes is before the regime has fallen, and before they've established what in Sharia is called Tamkeen [having a stable state], they started applying Sharia, thinking God gave them permission to control the land and establish a Caliphate.

Al-Qaeda and al-Nusra have been trying to take advantage of ISIL's rise, by attempting to present themselves as "moderate" compared to "extremist" ISIL, although it has the same aim of establishing sharia and a caliphate but doing so in a more gradual manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Joscelyn |first=Thomas |title=Al Qaeda appears 'moderate' compared to Islamic State, veteran jihadist says |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/10/al-qaeda-appears-moderate-compared-to-islamic-state-veteran-jihadist-says.php |work=Long War Journal |date=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Joscelyn |first=Thomas |date=26 October 2015 |title=A rare interview with an experienced Al Qaeda commander shows how the group is using ISIS to make itself look 'moderate' |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/a-rare-interview-with-an-experienced-al-qaeda-commander-shows-how-the-group-is-using-isis-to-make-itself-look-moderate-2015-10 |newspaper=Business Insider |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Joscelyn |first=Thomas |title=The Al Nusrah Front's 'inherited jihad' |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/06/inheritedjihad.php |work=Long War Journal |date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Joscelyn |first=Thomas |title=Officials from Al Nusrah Front, Ahrar al Sham vow to continue fight against Islamic State |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/07/officials-from-al-nusrah-front-ahrar-al-sham-vow-to-continue-fight-against-islamic-state.php |work=Long War Journal |date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Joscelyn |first=Thomas |date=9 February 2015 |title=Al Qaeda Uses ISIS to Try to Present Itself as Respectable, Even Moderate |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/al-qaeda-uses-isis-try-present-itself-respectable-even-moderate_845194.html |newspaper=The Weekly Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Nusra has criticised the way in which ISIL fully and immediately institutes sharia in the areas that fall under its control, since it alienates people too much.  It supports the gradual, slower approach favoured by al-Qaeda, preparing society to accept sharia and indoctrinating people through education before implementing the [[hudud]] aspects of sharia, such as throwing gays from the top of buildings, chopping limbs off, and public stoning.&lt;ref name="Joscelyn" /&gt; Al-Nusra and ISIL are both hostile towards the [[Druze]].  However, while al-Nusra has typically destroyed Druze shrines and pressured them to convert to Sunni Islam, ISIL regards the entire Druze community as a valid target for violence, as it does the [[Yazidis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Waleed |last=Rikab |url=http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/the-plight-of-syrias-druze-minority-and-u-s-options/ |title=The Plight of Syria's Druze Minority and U.S. Options |work=Syria Comment |date=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], the leader of al-Qaeda, has called for consultation ([[shura]]) within the "prophetic method" to be used when establishing the caliphate, criticising al-Baghdadi for not following the required steps. Al-Zawahiri has called upon ISIL members to close ranks and join al-Qaeda in fighting against Assad, the [[Shia]], Russia, Europe, and America and to stop the infighting between jihadist groups.  He called upon jihadists to establish Islamic entities in Egypt and the Levant, slowly implementing sharia before establishing a caliphate, and has called for violent assaults against America and the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Joscelyn |first=Thomas |title=Al Qaeda chief calls for jihadist unity to 'liberate Jerusalem' |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/11/al-qaedas-chief-calls-for-unity-to-liberate-jerusalem.php |work=Long War Journal |date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jaysh al-Islam]] group within the [[Islamic Front (Syria)|Islamic Front]] criticised ISIL, saying: "They killed the people of Islam and leave the idol worshippers ...

The current [[Grand Imam of al-Azhar]] and former president of [[al-Azhar University]], [[Ahmed el-Tayeb]], has strongly condemned the Islamic State, stating that it is acting "under the guise of this holy religion and have given themselves the name 'Islamic State' in an attempt to export their false Islam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Head of Egypt's al-Azhar condemns ISIS 'barbarity' |publisher=Al Arabiya English |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=3 December 2014 |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/12/03/Head-of-Egypt-s-al-Azhar-condemns-ISIS-barbarity-.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aawsat.net/2014/12/article55339431/egypts-al-azhar-stops-short-of-declaring-isis-apostates |first=Asharq |last=Al-Awsat |title=Egypt's Al-Azhar stops short of declaring ISIS apostates – Azhar statement rejects practice of takfirism |work=Asharq Al Awsat |date=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing the Quran, he stated: "The punishment for those who wage war against God and his Prophet and who strive to sow corruption on earth is death, crucifixion, the severing of hands and feet on opposite sides or banishment from the land.

In late December 2015, nearly 70,000 Indian Muslim clerics associated with the Indian [[Barelvi]] movement issued a [[fatwa]] condemning ISIL and similar organisations, saying they are "not Islamic organisations".

[[Mehdi Hasan]], a political journalist in the UK, said in the ''[[New Statesman]]'',

{{quote|Whether Sunni or Shia, Salafi or Sufi, conservative or liberal, Muslims – and Muslim leaders – have almost unanimously condemned and denounced ISIL not merely as un-Islamic but actively anti-Islamic.&lt;ref name="ns10Mar2015" /&gt;}}

Hassan Hassan, an analyst at the Delma Institute, wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that because the Islamic State "bases its teachings on religious texts that mainstream Muslim clerics do not want to deal with head on, new recruits leave the camp feeling that they have stumbled on the true message of Islam".&lt;ref name="guardian-traincamp" /&gt; In mid-February 2015, [[Graeme C.A.

[[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], an Egyptian [[Islamic theologian]] based in Qatar, said in his official website that the "United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the leaders of Daesh (ISIS/ISIL) terrorist group are from one species and they are two sides of the same coin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Staff writers |title=Al-Qaradawi: Rulers Of UAE And Daesh Leaders Are Two Sides Of The Same Coin {{!}} English – Middle East Press News Agency|url=http://middleeastpress.com/english/al-qaradawi-rulers-of-uae-and-daesh-leaders-are-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/|accessdate=4 August 2016|publisher=Middle East News Agency|date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Security Council]] in its [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267|Resolution 1267]] (1999) described [[Osama bin Laden]] and his al-Qaeda associates as operators of a network of [[terrorist training camp]]s.&lt;ref name=UNbinLaden&gt;{{cite web |title=Resolution 1267 (1999) Adopted by the Security Council at its 4051st meeting on 15 October 1999 |url=http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?docid=3b00f2298 |publisher=UNHCR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN's [[Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee|Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee]] first listed ISIL in its Sanctions List under the name "Al-Qaida in Iraq" on 18 October 2004, as an entity/group associated with al-Qaeda. On 2 June 2014, the group was added to its listing under the name "Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant". The [[European Union]] adopted the UN Sanctions List in 2002.&lt;ref name="berghof-foundation.org" /&gt;

Many world leaders and government spokespeople have called ISIL a terrorist group or banned it, without their countries having formally designated it as such. The following are examples:

The Government of Germany banned ISIL in September 2014. Activities banned include donations to the group, recruiting fighters, holding ISIL meetings and distributing its propaganda, [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|flying ISIL flags]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Eddy |first1=Melissa |title=Germany Bans Support for ISIS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/world/europe/germany-bans-support-of-isis.html |accessdate=19 November 2014 |work=The New York Times |date=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; wearing ISIL symbols and all ISIL activities. "The terror organisation Islamic State is a threat to public safety in Germany as well", said German politician [[Thomas de Maizière]]. He added, "Today's ban is directed solely against terrorists who abuse religion for their criminal goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sixth-sense-newspaper.de/german-news/1943-isil-banned-in-germany |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103205324/http://www.sixth-sense-newspaper.de/german-news/1943-isil-banned-in-germany |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 January 2015 |title=ISIL banned in Germany |first=Janette |last=Roberts |work=Sixth Sense |date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being a member of ISIL is also illegal in accordance with §&amp;nbsp;129a and §&amp;nbsp;129b of the [[Strafgesetzbuch|German criminal code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/18/007/1800759.pdf |title=Drucksache 18/759 |website= |publisher=Deutscher Bundestag |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, Switzerland banned ISIL's activities in the country, including propaganda and financial support of the fighters, with prison sentences as potential penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aa.com.tr/en/news/401536--switzerland-bans-isil |title=Switzerland bans ISIL |publisher=Anadolu Agency |date=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-December 2014, India banned ISIL after the arrest of an operator of a pro-ISIL Twitter account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Avaneesh |last=Pandey |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/india-bans-isis-after-government-raises-concerns-over-groups-online-presence-1759516 |title=India Bans ISIS After Government Raises Concerns Over Group's Online Presence |date=16 December 2014 |work=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan designated ISIL as a banned organisation in late August 2015, under which all elements expressing sympathy for the group would be blacklisted and sanctioned.&lt;ref name="ET" /&gt;

Media sources worldwide have described ISIL as a terrorist organisation.&lt;ref name="ISIS or ISIL? The debate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes27Aug14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ft-20140617" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCoyTop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Indonesia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ListerTop"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lister |first=Tim |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/12/world/meast/who-is-the-isis/ |title=ISIS: The first terror group to build an Islamic state? |publisher=CNN |date=13 June 2014 |accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Militia, territorial authority and other classifications ====

By 2014, ISIL was increasingly being viewed as a [[militia]] rather than just a terrorist group.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; As major Iraqi cities fell to ISIL in June 2014, Jessica Lewis, a former US Army intelligence officer at the [[Institute for the Study of War]], described ISIL at that time as

{{quote|text=not a terrorism problem anymore, [but rather] an army on the move in Iraq and Syria, and they are taking terrain. They have shadow governments in and around [[Baghdad]], and they have an aspirational goal to govern. I don't know whether they want to control Baghdad, or if they want to destroy the functions of the Iraqi state, but either way the outcome will be disastrous for Iraq.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vick |first1=Karl |last2=Baker |first2=Aryn |url=http://time.com/2859454/iraq-tikrit-isis-baghdad-mosul/ |title=Extremists in Iraq Continue March Toward Baghdad |work=Time |date=11 June 2014 |accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:London protest 2015 Ankara bombings (2).jpg|thumb|Supporters of the Turkish Labour Party protesting in London following the [[2015 Ankara bombings]]]]
Lewis has called ISIL

{{quote|text=an advanced military leadership. They have incredible command and control and they have a sophisticated reporting mechanism from the field that can relay tactics and directives up and down the line. They are well-financed, and they have big sources of manpower, not just the foreign fighters, but also prisoner escapees.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;}}

Former US Defense Secretary [[Chuck Hagel]] saw an "imminent threat to every interest we have", but former top counter-terrorism adviser [[Daniel Benjamin]] derided such talk as a "farce" that panics the public.&lt;ref name="threat"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mazzetti |first1=Mark |first2=Eric |last2=Schmitt |first3=Mark |last3=Landler |date=10 September 2014 |title=Struggling to Gauge ISIS Threat, Even as U.S. Prepares to Act |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/11/world/middleeast/struggling-to-gauge-isis-threat-even-as-us-prepares-to-act.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former British Foreign Secretary [[David Miliband]] concluded that the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] caused the creation of ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Porter |first1=Tom |date=10 August 2015 |title=Iraq War Created Isis, Concedes David Miliband |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/iraq-war-created-isis-concedes-david-miliband-1460557 |work=International Business Times |accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Pankaj Mishra]] rejects the idea that the group is a resurgence of medieval Islam, saying instead:

{{quote|text=In actuality, Isis is the canniest of all traders in the flourishing international economy of disaffection: the most resourceful among all those who offer the security of collective identity to isolated and fearful individuals. It promises, along with others who retail racial, national and religious supremacy, to release the anxiety and frustrations of the private life into the violence of the global.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/24/how-to-think-about-islamic-state |title=How to think about Islamic State |first=Pankaj |last=Mishra |work=The Guardian |date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A certain change of attitude occurred following the inauguration of US President Trump. On 28 January 2017, he issued a National Security Presidential Memorandum which called for a comprehensive plan to destroy ISIS to be formulated by the Defense Department within 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-02-02/pdf/2017-02386.pdf |title=National Security Presidential Memorandum no. 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a June 2015 [[Reuters]] report that cited "jihadist ideologues" as a source, 90% of ISIL's fighters in Iraq are Iraqi, and 70% of its fighters in Syria are Syrian. The article stated that the group has 40,000 fighters and 60,000 supporters across its two primary strongholds in Iraq and Syria.&lt;ref name="saddam"&gt;{{cite news |title=Saddam's former army is secret of Baghdadi's success |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/16/us-mideast-crisis-baghdadi-insight-idUSKBN0OW1VN20150616 |agency=Reuters |date=16 June 2015 |accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to scholar [[Fawaz Gerges]] writing in ''ISIS: A History'', some "30 percent of the senior figures" in ISIL's military command are former army and police officers from the disbanded Iraqi security forces, drawn to ISIL by the US [[De-Ba'athification]] policy and turned towards Sunni Islamism, following the US invasion of Iraq.&lt;ref name="NYRoB-7-9-2015" /&gt;

According to a poll by [[Pew Research Center]], Muslim populations of various countries have overwhelmingly negative views of ISIS with [[Lebanon]] having the most unfavorable views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/17/in-nations-with-significant-muslim-populations-much-disdain-for-isis/ft_15-11-17_isis_views/ |title= Views of ISIS Overwhelmingly Negative |date=17 November 2015 |work=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jacob Poushter191 comments |url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/17/in-nations-with-significant-muslim-populations-much-disdain-for-isis/ |title=Most dislike ISIS in Muslim countries &amp;#124; Pew Research Center |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=21 May 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505125029/http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/17/in-nations-with-significant-muslim-populations-much-disdain-for-isis/ |archivedate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most of these countries, concerns about Islamic extremism have been growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/01/concerns-about-islamic-extremism-on-the-rise-in-middle-east/ |title=Concerns about Islamic Extremism on the Rise in Middle East &amp;#124; Pew Research Center |publisher=Pewglobal.org |accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Dearlove]], former head of Britain's [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6), said that the Saudis were "deeply attracted to any militancy that can effectively challenge [[Shia Islam|Shia-dom]] [Shia version of Islam]."&lt;ref name="Saudi" /&gt; Dearlove stated that, "For ISIS to be able to surge into the Sunni areas of Iraq in the way that it has done recently has to be the consequence of substantial and sustained funding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/patrick-goodenough/saudis-deny-supporting-isis-after-former-mi6-head-speaks-substantial |title=Saudis Deny Supporting ISIS After Former MI6 Head Speaks of 'Substantial and Sustained Funding' |last=Goodenough |first=Patrick |date=9 July 2014 |publisher=CNSNews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an August 2014 email, leaked by [[WikiLeaks]], apparently from former US Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] to then counselor to Barack Obama [[John Podesta]], a memo states that both Saudi Arabia and Qatar "are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schwartz |first1=Mattathias |title=Hillary Clinton acknowledges Saudi terror financing in hacked email, hinting at tougher approach |url=https://theintercept.com/2016/10/12/hillary-clinton-acknowledges-saudi-terror-financing-in-hacked-email-hinting-at-tougher-approach/ |work=[[The Intercept]] |date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McKernan 2016"&gt;{{cite news | last=McKernan | first=Bethan | title=Hillary Clinton 'thinks Saudi Arabia funds Isis', leaked document claims | website=The Independent | date=11 October 2016 | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/hillary-clinton-emails-leak-wikileaks-saudi-arabia-qatar-isis-podesta-latest-a7355466.html | access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BelfastTelegraph.co.uk 2016"&gt;{{cite news | title=Boris Johnson's Saudi Arabia comments slapped down by PM but Hillary Clinton, German intelligence and the UN expressed similar views | website=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk | date=8 December 2016 | url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/news-analysis/boris-johnsons-saudi-arabia-comments-slapped-down-by-pm-but-hillary-clinton-german-intelligence-and-the-un-expressed-similar-views-35279794.html | access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Qatar ====

[[Qatar]] has long been accused of acting as a conduit for the flow of funds to ISIL. While there is no proof that the Qatari government is behind the movement of funds from the gas-rich nation to ISIL, it has been criticised for not doing enough to stem the flow of financing. Private donors within Qatar, sympathetic to the aims of radical groups such as [[al-Nusra Front]] and ISIL, are believed to be channeling their resources to support these organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Qatar and ISIS Funding: The U.S. Approach |url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/qatar-and-isis-funding-the-u.s.-approach |publisher=The Washington Institute |date=August 2014 |accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Islamic State: Where does jihadist group get its support? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29004253 |publisher=BBC |date=1 September 2014 |accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury Department]], a number of terrorist financiers have been operating in Qatar. Qatari citizen [[Abd Al-Rahman al-Nuaimi]] has served as an interlocutor between Qatari donors and leaders of [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]] (AQI). Nuaimi reportedly oversaw the transfer of US$2 million per month to AQI over a period of time. He is also one of several of Qatar-based al-Qaeda financiers sanctioned by the US Treasury in recent years. According to some reports, US officials believe that the largest portion of private donations supporting ISIS and al Qaeda-linked groups now comes from Qatar rather than Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Qatar Is a U.S. Ally.

In August 2014, German minister [[Gerd Müller (politician)|Gerd Müller]] accused Qatar of having links to ISIL, stating: "You have to ask who is arming, who is financing ISIS troops.

According to Mohammed Alaa Ghanem, director of government relations for the Syrian American Council, "The only report we have received on anything resembling a ceasefire was that ISIS and Sons of Golan, an FSA brigade outside Damascus, halted fighting for 24 hours to collect bodies before hostilities resumed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/16/syrian-opposition-blasts-reports-it-signed-a-truce-with-isis.html |title=Syrian Opposition Blasts Reports It Signed a Truce With ISIS |work=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt; "FSA commanders declared that they will continue that fight until ISIS is completely eradicated in Damascus suburbs.

In August 2018 Australia stripped the Australian citizenship from five terrorists who had travelled to fight with the Islamic State and barred them from entering Australia again.

The law can only be applied to individuals with double citizenship. Justice Minister [[Ard van der Steur|Ard Van der Steur]] stated the legal changes were necessary to stop jihadists from returning to the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/212749|title=Dutch Jihadists to be stripped of dual citizenship|website=Israel National News|language=en|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, four jihadists were stripped of their citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2017/sep/13/netherlands-strip-four-jihadists-of-citizenship-1656702.html|title=Netherlands strip four jihadists of citizenship|work=The New Indian Express|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2012-November 2018 period, above 310 individuals had travelled from the Netherlands to the conflict in Syria and Iraq. Of those 85 had been killed and 55 returned to the Netherlands. Of the surviving Dutch foreign fighters in the region, 135 are fighers in the conflict zone and three quarters are members of ISIS. The remaining quarter have joined [[Al-Qaeda]] affiliated groups such as [[Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham]] or [[Tanzim Hurras al-Deen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://english.aivd.nl/publications/publications/2018/11/09/the-legacy-of-syria-global-jihadism-remains-a-threat-to-europe|title=Syria’s Legacy - Global jihadism remains a threat to Europe|last=|first=|publisher=[[General Intelligence and Security Service]]|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181201090804/https://english.aivd.nl/publications/publications/2018/11/09/the-legacy-of-syria-global-jihadism-remains-a-threat-to-europe|archive-date=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Sweden ======
Up to 2018, an estimated 300 individuals had travelled from Sweden to join the civil war in Syria.&lt;ref name="ispi2018" /&gt; In March 2018 Kurdish authorities reported they had captured 41 IS supporters with either Swedish citizenship or residence permit in Sweden, of which 5 had key positions in the organisation and one was the head of the ISIL propaganda efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/kurdisk-kalla-41-is-svenskar-fangslade-i-syrien/|title=Kurdisk källa: 41 IS-svenskar fängslade i Syrien - DN.SE|date=24 March 2018|work=Dagens Nyheter|access-date=25 March 2018|language=sv-se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== United Kingdom ======
Cabinet minister [[William Hague]] stated in 2014 that up to 400 UK citizens had joined ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/16/400-uk-citizens-fighting-syria-isis-iraq-william-hague|title=Up to 400 British citizens may be fighting in Syria, says William Hague|last=Wintour|first=Patrick|last2=Watt|first2=Nicholas|date=16 June 2014|website=The Guardian|access-date=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government instituted a practice where if those who had joined had double citizenships were stripped of their UK citizenship to prevent them from arriving back in the UK. By 2017, 150 individuals had been stripped of citizenship and were thus unable to enter the United Kingdom again.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/30/uk-has-stripped-150-jihadists-and-criminals-of-citizenship|title=UK 'has stripped 150 jihadists and criminals of citizenship'|last=Association|first=Press|date=30 July 2017|website=The Guardian|access-date=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Groups expressing support for ISIL ====
The [[Terrorism Research &amp; Analysis Consortium|Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium]] (TRAC) has identified 60 jihadist groups in 30 countries that have pledged allegiance to or support for ISIL as of mid-November 2014. That many of these groups were previously affiliated with [[al-Qaeda]] suggests a shift in global jihadist leadership towards ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Riyadh |last=Mohammed |url=http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/16/ISIS-Doubles-Down-Infidels-Boosted-60-New-Terror-Groups#sthash.eYktEthB.dpuf |title=ISIS Beheads Another American As 60 New Terror Groups Join |work=The Fiscal Times |date=16 November 2014 |accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISIL's claims to territory have brought it into armed conflict with many governments, militias and other armed groups. International rejection of ISIL as a terrorist entity and rejection of its claim to even exist have placed it in conflict with countries around the world.

The Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), also referred to as the Counter-ISIL Coalition or Counter-DAESH Coalition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gulfnews.com/news/region/iraq/coalition-commanders-seek-plan-to-counter-daesh-advance-1.1398681 |title=Coalition commanders seek plan to counter Daesh advance |date=14 October 2014 |agency=Agence France-Presse |work=Gulf News}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a US-led group of nations and [[non-state actor]]s that have committed to "work together under a common, multifaceted, and long-term strategy to degrade and defeat ISIL/Daesh". According to a joint statement issued by 59 national governments and the European Union on 3 December 2014, participants in the Counter-ISIL Coalition are focused on multiple lines of effort:&lt;ref name=Anti-ISIL&gt;{{cite web |title=Joint Statement Issued by Partners at the Counter-ISIL Coalition Ministerial Meeting |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2014/12/234627.htm |date=3 December 2014 |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Supporting military operations, capacity building, and training;
# Stopping the flow of foreign terrorist fighters;
# Cutting off ISIL/Daesh's access to financing and funding;
# Addressing associated humanitarian relief and crises; and
# Exposing ISIL/Daesh's true nature (ideological delegitimisation).

[[Operation Inherent Resolve]] is the operational name given by the US to military operations against ISIL and Syrian al-Qaeda affiliates.
[[Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve]] (CJTF–OIR) is co-ordinating the military portion of the response.

The [[Arab League]], [[European Union]], [[NATO]], and [[Gulf Cooperation Council|GCC]] are part of the Counter-ISIL Coalition:&lt;ref name=Anti-ISIL /&gt;

Al-Nusra has launched many attacks and [[List of bombings during the Syrian Civil War|bombings]], mostly against targets affiliated with or supportive of the Syrian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Roggio |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2013/06/suicide_bombers_kill_14_in_dam.php |title=Suicide bombers kill 14 in Damascus |work=Long War Journal |date=11 June 2013 |accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been media reports that many of al-Nusra's foreign fighters have left to join al-Baghdadi's ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10067318/Syria-Jabhat-al-Nusra-split-after-leaders-pledge-of-support-for-al-Qaeda.html |title=Syria: Jabhat al-Nusra split after leader's pledge of support for al-Qaeda |work=The Telegraph |date=19 May 2013 |location=London |first=Richard |last=Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, after continued tensions, al-Qaeda publicly disavowed any relations with ISIL.&lt;ref name="AlQaedaTiesEnd" /&gt; However, ISIL and al-Nusra Front still cooperate with each other occasionally when they fight against the Syrian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/jabhat-al-nusra-isis-alliance-could-spread-beyond-damascus-1877819 |title=Jabhat Al-Nusra And ISIS Alliance Could Spread Beyond Damascus |first=Erin |last=Banco |newspaper=International Business Times |date=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Eugenio |last=Lilli |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/islamic-state/11230622/How-would-a-deal-between-al-Qaeda-and-Isil-change-Syrias-civil-war.html |title=How would a deal between al-Qaeda and Isil change Syria's civil war? |work=The Telegraph |location=London |date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mitchell |last=Prothero |url=http://www.sacbee.com/2014/03/04/6207631/isis-joins-other-rebels-to-thwart.html |title=ISIS joins other rebels to thwart Syria regime push near Lebanon |newspaper=The Sacramento Bee |date=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The two groups [ISIL and al-Nusra] share a nihilistic worldview, a loathing for modernity, and for the West. They subscribe to the same perverted interpretations of Islam. Other common traits include a penchant for suicide attacks, and sophisticated exploitation of the internet and social media. Like ISIL, several Al Qaeda franchises are interested in taking and holding territory; AQAP has been much less successful at it. The main differences between Al Qaeda and ISIL are largely political—and personal. Over the past decade, Al Qaeda has twice embraced ISIL (and its previous manifestations) as brothers-in-arms. |first=Bobby|last=Ghosh |source="ISIL and Al Qaeda: Terror's frenemies", ''[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bobby |last=Ghosh |url=http://qz.com/324909/isil-and-al-qaeda-terrors-frenemies/ |title=ISIL and Al Qaeda: Terror's frenemies |work=Quartz |date=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 10 September 2015, an audio message was released by al-Qaeda's leader [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] criticising ISIL's self-proclaimed caliphate and accusing it of "sedition". This was described by some media outlets as a "declaration of war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James Gordon |last=Meek |title=Al Qaeda Leader Al-Zawahiri Declares War on ISIS 'Caliph' Al-Baghdadi |url=https://news.yahoo.com/al-qaeda-leader-al-zawahiri-declares-war-isis-151231254--abc-news-topstories.html |via=Yahoo!

Human Rights Watch documented three apparent summary executions and at least ten public floggings by the Islamic Youth Shura Council, which joined ISIL in November. It also documented the beheading of three Derna residents and dozens of seemingly politically motivated assassinations of judges, public officials, members of the security forces and others. Sarah Leah Watson, Director of HRW Middle East and North Africa, said: "Commanders should understand that they may face domestic or international prosecution for the grave rights abuses their forces are committing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/11/27/libya-extremists-terrorizing-derna-residents |title=Libya: Extremists Terrorizing Derna Residents |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of ISIL's methods, the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] has stated that the group "seeks to subjugate civilians under its control and dominate every aspect of their lives through terror, indoctrination, and the provision of services to those who obey".&lt;ref name=UNRuleOfTerror/&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] has held ISIL responsible for the [[ethnic cleansing]] of ethnic and religious minority groups in northern Iraq on a "historic scale", putting entire communities "at risk of being wiped off the map of Iraq". In a special report released on 2 September 2014, the organization described how ISIL had "systematically targeted non-Arab and non-Sunni Muslim communities, killing or abducting hundreds, possibly thousands, of individuals and forcing more than 830,000 others to flee the areas it has captured since 10 June 2014". Among these people were Assyrian Christians, Turkmen Shia, Shabak Shia, [[Kaka'i]], Yazidis and Sabean Mandeans, who have lived together for centuries in [[Nineveh Province|Nineveh]] province, large parts of which have come under ISIL's control.&lt;ref name=amnestyethnic /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29026491 |date=2 September 2014 |title=Iraq crisis: Islamic State accused of ethnic cleansing |work=BBC News|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment of civilians ===

During the Iraqi conflict in 2014, ISIL released dozens of videos showing its ill treatment of civilians, many of whom had apparently been targeted on the basis of their religion or ethnicity. Navi Pillay, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, warned of war crimes being committed in the Iraqi war zone, and disclosed a UN report of ISIL militants murdering Iraqi Army soldiers and 17 civilians in a single street in Mosul.

In late 2014, ISIL released a pamphlet that focused on the treatment of female slaves.&lt;ref name="Smith – ISIS Publish Pamphlet"&gt;{{cite news |first=Amelia |last=Smith |url=http://www.newsweek.com/isis-release-questions-and-answers-pamphlet-how-treat-female-slaves-290511 |title=ISIS Publish Pamphlet On How to Treat Female Slaves |work=Newsweek |date=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Our faith condones" /&gt; It claims that the [[Quran]] allows fighters to have sex with captives, including adolescent girls, and to beat slaves as discipline.

''[[The Independent]]'' reported in 2015 that the usage of Yazidi sex slaves had created ongoing friction among fighters within ISIL. Sajad Jiyad, a Research Fellow and Associate Member at the [[Iraqi Institute for Economic Reform]], told the newspaper that many ISIL supporters and fighters had been in denial about the trafficking of kidnapped Yazidi women until a ''[[Dabiq (magazine)|Dabiq]]'' article justifying the practice was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/yazidi-sex-slaves-gangraped-in-public-by-isis-fighters-harrowing-accounts-reveal-10166875.html |title=Yazidi sex slaves 'gang-raped in public' by Isis fighters, harrowing accounts reveal |work=Independent |date=10 April 2015 |accessdate=11 April 2015 |last=Saul |first=Heather |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-infighting-tensions-rise-over-use-of-yazidi-sex-slaves-loss-of-kobani-and-poor-services-in-areas-controlled-by-group-10061457.html |title=Isis infighting: Tensions rise over use of Yazidi sex slaves, loss of Kobani and poor services in areas controlled by group |work=Independent |date=21 February 2015 |accessdate=11 April 2015 |last=Saul |first=Heather |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' said in August 2015 that "[t]he systematic rape of women and girls from the Yazidi religious minority has become deeply enmeshed in the organization and the radical theology of the Islamic State in the year since the group announced it was reviving slavery as an institution."&lt;ref name="NYT rape theology" /&gt; The article claims that ISIL is not merely exonerating but sacralising rape, and illustrated this with the testimony of escapees. One 15-year-old victim said that, while she was being assaulted, her rapist "kept telling me this is [[ibadah]]"; a 12-year-old victim related how her assailant claimed that, "by raping me, he is drawing closer to God";&lt;ref name="NYT rape theology" /&gt; and one adult prisoner told how, when she challenged her captor about repeatedly raping a 12 year old, she was met with the retort, "No, she's not a little girl, she's a slave and she knows exactly how to have sex and having sex with her pleases God."&lt;ref name="NYT rape theology" /&gt;

In December 2013, two suicide bombers stormed the headquarters of TV station Salaheddin and killed five journalists, after accusing the station of "distorting the image of Iraq's Sunni community". Reporters Without Borders reported that on 7 September 2014, ISIL seized and on 11 October publicly beheaded Raad al-Azzawi, a TV Salaheddin cameraman from the village of Samra, east of Tikrit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/10/reports-isil-executes-iraqi-journalist-20141010194149556427.html |title=ISIL 'publicly executes Iraqi journalist' |date=11 October 2014 |publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2014|October|}}, according to the Journalistic Freedoms Observatory, ISIL is holding nine journalists and has nine others under close observation in Mosul and Salahuddin province.&lt;ref name="en.rsf.org" /&gt;

During 2013 and part of 2014, an ISIL unit nicknamed [[The Beatles (terrorist cell)|the Beatles]] acquired and held 12 Western journalists hostage, along with aid workers and other foreign hostages, totalling 23 or 24 known hostages. A Polish journalist Marcin Suder was captured in July 2013 but escaped four months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/world/middleeast/horror-before-the-beheadings-what-isis-hostages-endured-in-syria.html |title=ISIS Hostages Endured Torture and Dashed Hopes, Freed Cellmates Say |work=The New York Times |first=Rukmini |last=Callimachi |date=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unit [[ISIL beheadings|executed American journalists]] [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]] and [[Steven Sotloff]] and released beheading videos. Eight of the other journalists were released for ransom: Danish journalist Daniel Rye Ottosen, French journalists Didier François, Edouard Elias, Nicolas Hénin, and Pierre Torres, and Spanish journalists Marc Marginedas, Javier Espinosa, and Ricardo García Vilanova. The unit continues to hold hostage British journalist [[John Cantlie]] and a female aid worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/24/world/middleeast/the-fate-of-23-hostages-in-syria.html |title=The Fates of 23 ISIS Hostages in Syria |first=Karen |last=Yourish |work=The New York Times |date=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyber-security group the [[Citizen Lab]] released a report finding a possible link between ISIL and a digital attack on the Syrian citizen media group [[Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently]] (RSS). Supporters of the media group received an emailed link to an image of supposed airstrikes, but clicking on the link introduced malware to the user's computer that sends details of the user's IP address and system each time it restarts. That information has been enough to allow ISIL to locate RSS supporters. "The group has been targeted for kidnappings, house raids, and at least one alleged targeted killing. At the time of that writing, ISIL was allegedly holding several citizen journalists in Raqqa", according to the Citizen Lab report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnston |first1=Chris |title=Islamic State suspected of cyber-attack on Raqqa opponents |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/19/islamic-state-cyber-attack-raqqa-opponents-isis-syria-malware |work=The Guardian |date=9 December 2014 |accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Destruction of cultural and religious heritage ===
{{Main|Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL}}
[[File:Temple of Bel, Palmyra 02.jpg|thumb|[[Temple of Bel]] in [[Palmyra]], which was destroyed by ISIL in August 2015]]

[[UNESCO]]'s Director-General [[Irina Bokova]] has warned that ISIL is destroying Iraq's cultural heritage, in what she has called "[[cultural cleansing]]". "We don't have time to lose because extremists are trying to erase the identity, because they know that if there is no identity, there is no memory, there is no history", she said. Referring to the ancient cultures of Christians, Yazidis and other minorities, she said, "This is a way to destroy identity. You deprive them of their culture, you deprive them of their history, their heritage, and that is why it goes hand in hand with genocide. Along with the physical persecution they want to eliminate – to delete – the memory of these different cultures ... we think this is appalling, and this is not acceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/video/2014/11/02/iraqs-heritage-needs-protection-from-isl?videoId=346781460 |title=Iraq's heritage needs protection from Islamic State – UNESCO |date=2 November 2014 |agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saad Eskander]], head of Iraq's National Archives said, "For the first time you have cultural cleansing... For the Yazidis, religion is oral, nothing is written. By destroying their places of worship... you are killing cultural memory. It is the same with the Christians – it really is a threat beyond belief."&lt;ref name=CSM&gt;{{cite news |first=Jane |last=Arraf |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2014/1108/Islamic-State-seeking-to-delete-entire-cultures-UNESCO-chief-warns-in-Iraq |title=Islamic State seeking to 'delete' entire cultures, UNESCO chief warns in Iraq |work=The Christian Science Monitor |date=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To finance its activities, ISIL is stealing artefacts from Syria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Franklin |last=Lamb |title=SYRIA: "Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently" |website=Intifada Palestine |url=http://www.intifada-palestine.com/2014/05/syria-raqqa-slaughtered-silently/ |date=8 May 2014 |accessdate=28 December 2014 |quote=transcript of an interview conducted by the author at the National Museum of Syria with an employee of the Directorate General of Antiquities and Museums (DGAM).

UNESCO has asked for [[United Nations Security Council]] controls on the sale of antiquities, similar to those imposed after the 2003 [[Iraq War]]. UNESCO is working with [[Interpol]], national customs authorities, museums, and major auction houses in attempts to prevent looted items from being sold.&lt;ref name=CSM /&gt; ISIL occupied [[Mosul Museum]], the second most important museum in Iraq, as it was about to reopen after years of rebuilding following the Iraq War, saying that the statues were against Islam and threatening to destroy the museum's contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Melissa |last1=Block |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/07/09/330183802/the-plight-of-mosuls-museum-iraqi-antiquities-at-risk-of-ruin |title=The Plight of Mosul's Museum: Iraqi Antiquities At Risk Of Ruin |date=9 July 2014 |publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dickey-7.7.14"&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Dickey |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/07/isis-is-about-to-destroy-biblical-history-in-iraq.html |title=ISIS Is About to Destroy Biblical History in Iraq |work=The Daily Beast |date=7 July 2014 |access-date=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISIL considers worshipping at graves tantamount to [[idolatry]], and seeks to purify the community of unbelievers. It has used bulldozers to crush buildings and archaeological sites.&lt;ref name="Dickey-7.7.14" /&gt; [[Bernard Haykel]] has described al-Baghdadi's creed as "a kind of untamed [[Wahhabism]]", saying, "For Al Qaeda, violence is a means to an ends{{sic}}; for ISIS, it is an end in itself".{{r|ISIS_NYT}} The destruction by ISIL in July 2014 of the [[Mosques and shrines of Mosul|tomb and shrine of the prophet Yunus]] – [[Jonah]] in Christianity – the 13th-century mosque of [[Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din|Imam Yahya Abu al-Qassimin]], the 14th-century shrine of prophet Jerjis – [[Saint George|St George]] to Christians – and the attempted destruction of the [[Mosques and shrines of Mosul|Hadba]] minaret at the 12th-century [[Mosques and shrines of Mosul|Great Mosque of Al-Nuri]] have been described as "an unchecked outburst of extreme Wahhabism".&lt;ref name=Al-Alawi&gt;{{cite web |last1=Al-Alawi |first1=Irfan |title=Extreme Wahhabism on Display in Shrine Destruction in Mosul |url=http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4574/jonah-shrine-destruction |publisher=Gatestone Institute |accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "There were explosions that destroyed buildings dating back to the [[Assyria]]n era", said [[National Museum of Iraq]] director Qais Rashid, referring to the destruction of the shrine of Yunus. He cited another case where "Daesh (ISIL) gathered over 1,500 manuscripts from convents and other holy places and burnt all of them in the middle of the city square".&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-30/islamic-state-pillaging-iraqi-artefacts2c-unesco-warns/5777990 |title=Islamic State: Jihadists destroying and looting Iraqi heritage sites for artefacts, UNESCO warns |publisher=ABC News |agency=Agence France-Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, ISIL reportedly bulldozed the 13th-century BC Assyrian city of [[Nimrud]], believing its sculptures to be idolatrous. [[UNESCO]] head, [[Irina Bokova]], deemed this to be a war crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nimrud: Outcry as IS bulldozers attack ancient Iraq site |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31760656 |accessdate=6 March 2015 |work=BBC News|date=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISIL has burned or stolen collections of books and papers from the various locations including the Central Library of Mosul (which they rigged with explosives and burned down),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Johnlee |last=Varghese |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/isis-burns-down-mosul-library-destroys-8000-rare-books-manuscripts-624375 |title=Isis Burns Down Mosul Library, Destroys 8,000 Rare Books and Manuscripts |publisher=Ibtimes.co.in |date=24 February 2015 |accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the library at the [[University of Mosul]], a Sunni Muslim library, a 265-year-old Latin Church and Monastery of the Dominican Fathers, and the Mosul Museum Library. Some destroyed or stolen works date back to 5000 BCE and include "Iraq newspapers dating to the early 20th century, maps and books from the Ottoman Empire, and book collections contributed by about 100 of Mosul's establishment families." The stated goal is to destroy all non-Islamic books.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13416">'''Management due diligence''' is the process of appraising a company's [[senior management]]—evaluating each individual's effectiveness in contributing to the organization's [[Strategic management|strategic objectives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Management Audit|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/management-audit.asp|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assessing company management is crucial when closing business deals. It can mean the difference between long-term success or sudden failure. It also helps the organisation understand how the teams perform their roles in context with the company's future business plan. This helps clarify the structure of the organisation's work-force.&lt;ref name="Best practice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Best practice guideline- Due Diligence|url=http://www.crelos.com/assets/Human-capital-due-diligence-the-assessment-and-development-of-management-teams.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="good manager"&gt;{{cite web|title=What makes a good manager|url=http://www.mas.org.uk/management-advisory-service/what-makes-a-good-manager.html|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The management due diligence process can be identified as an informative tool for external stakeholders, and can also be referred to as Management Assessment as it addresses the team’s dynamics and highlight the risks.&lt;ref name=Assessment&gt;{{cite web|title=Assessment and development- Management Due Diligence|url=http://www.ashleyhoyle.co.uk/leadership_development_consulting/due_diligence_management.aspx|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management assessment ==

Management assessment usually focuses on assessing the leadership skills and characteristics of the organisation's managers—such as the ability to adjust to a changing environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senior management|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/senior-management.html|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and communicate effectively with other individuals. These characteristics are key points in successful leaders.&lt;ref name="good manager"/&gt;

A leader must consider all factors concerning a strategic decision, such as possible effects on employees and customers. Engaging employees and customers in the decision process helps build better relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Five characteristics of great leaders|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3004914/5-characteristics-great-leaders|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transactions that require management due diligence==
Companies typically apply the due diligence process when they are about to engage in a major transaction with another company—such as selling or purchasing products or services, or buying (merging with or acquiring) the other company.&lt;ref name="What is"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Due Diligence and how do you perform it?|url=http://www.businessknowhow.com/money/duediligence.htm|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some transactions require a due diligence report that includes managements.&lt;ref name=Meaning&gt;{{cite web|title=Meaning of due diligence|url=http://www.jsandco.in/Uploaded%20Image/Due%20diligence.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transactions that might require managerial assessments include:

=== Mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances ===
Organizations considering a merger, acquisition or alliance should perform due diligence. This due diligence should investigate the other party's management team. Many mergers and acquisitions fail because of human resources and management-related issues, such as cultural clashes. These incidents occur because of different cultural values or different individual beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merger Due Diligence- The devil in details|url=http://www.workforce.com/articles/merger-due-diligence-the-devil-in-the-details|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid such incidents, and cut costs on the long run, management teams must be assessed thoroughly.&lt;ref name=Meaning/&gt;

=== Partnerships ===
Before organizations signs a partnership contract, they must investigate the other organization’s matters and affiliations, organizational structures, and behaviors. A management due diligence process achieves this.

=== Joint ventures and collaborations ===
When forming a relationship with another organizations, management due diligence helps an organization introduce  management structure the behavior of individuals.&lt;ref name=Meaning/&gt;

=== Management due diligence's responsibility ===
Not only buyers carry out management due diligence, but also sellers of an organization. Usually, the process of selling an organization or adopting any external growth strategies requires the sharing of warranties. These warranties require private information from the organization—possibly including information and activities that they must shield from the view of third parties. In this case, the seller should carry out due diligence to ensure secure data.&lt;ref name=Meaning/&gt;

==Importance==
Management due diligence ensures sustainable profit and growth for organisations, as it identifies the human capital components. It ensures that highly skilled people are assigned the correct jobs and responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Best practice"/&gt; It increases the chance of a good return on investment by reducing risk.&lt;ref name=Assessment/&gt;

Management due diligence identifies strengths and weaknesses of individuals in the management team and assesses their contributions to the organisation.&lt;ref name="Best practice"/&gt; It assesses management team members' abilities to reach common goals.&lt;ref name=Firefly&gt;{{cite web|title=Management Due Diligence|url=http://www.fireflypartners.co.uk/mngmentduediligence.html|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It identifies undiscovered dangers that eventually affect productivity. These might include unacknowledged motives or personal conflicts between individuals in management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Due Diligence- The management team aspect: who's driving your company|url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/contributors.asp?id=803|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It helps organizations efficiently appraise candidates for a management team position.&lt;ref name=Firefly/&gt;

Management due diligence gives an organization a basis for expectations for team and individual performance. Accordingly, the organization can determine whether managers need training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Performance appraisal for teams|url=https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/performance-management/reference-materials/historical/teams.pdf|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Since management due diligence lies in the financial analysis of a due diligence report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Due Diligence|url=http://www.icaew.com/en/members/business-resources/business-management-and-strategy/m-and-a/types-of-due-diligence|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shares the same process as creating a due diligence report with few variations. 

===Preparation===
Preparation is key to an effective management due diligence process. In this phase, organizations gain sufficient knowledge about other organizations. This helps them decide on communication methods between them and other entities, in addition to putting resources in place to promote a successful process.  After settling those issues, the organization must:

''Form a team for the analysis process'' from skilled people with enough experience. After forming the team, the organization assigns responsibilities and settles on a process timeline. The organization may fill gaps in expertise by hiring or contracting external people.

''Involve managers'' as early as possible''' as they must get to know the other organization's management team. Early introductions help managers deal with later obstacles.

''Create checklists'' tailored to particular risks associated with the other organization.

''Prepare a list of data requests'' for the information an organization needs to complete the process.&lt;ref name="Main steps"/&gt;  Such data could include the business plan's management team section,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Due Diligence information request|url=http://www.stevensonco.com/documents/Due-Diligence-Information-Request-Sample.pdf|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or management organizational structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sample Due Diligence request list|url=http://www.theventurealley.com/files/2013/08/Sample-due-diligence-request-list-Trent-Dykes.pd_1.pdf|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''After negotiations, have both parties sign a confidentiality report'' to protect sensitive data from third parties. Agree on a method to store all confidential data—for example, an online data repository&lt;ref name="Main steps"/&gt; that both parties can view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtual Data Room|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/V/Virtual_Data_Room.html|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Execution===
In this phase the organization begins analyzing gathered data. The team tries to confirm the target's representations and "soft" aspects of the target, such as its corporate culture. The team must make sure the other organization fits with its own after assessing their management quality. After gathering all the information, the team advises on whether their organization should continue to work with the other organization.

===Closure===
After the team finishes analyzing the management team, they submit a report to the final decision makers. If the team exposes irregularities or unexpected risks, the organization can bid on contract changes. If everything passes the assessment, team members switch to integration planning.&lt;ref name="Main steps"/&gt;

==Aspects==
By performing management due diligence to assess the individuals working in an organization, different aspects must be appraised. The diagram outlines the main aspects that must be evaluated. The four circles in the middle represent the basic qualities that are considered essential for an individual assessment. The bigger circle "Role" represents the duties of the individuals in a certain organization. These duties usually vary from one individual to another depending on the job description of that individual. The biggest circle representing the employing organization is located in a market, making it easy to get affected by various external factors.&lt;ref name="Best practice"/&gt; These external factors are capable of hindering the organization from achieving its strategic goals and long-term objectives, making this a challenge that has to be dealt with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=External Factors|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/external-factors.html|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the individual assessment to be precise and accurate, it must be done after the organization's requirements have been highlighted and responsibilities of each individual are clear. Having such knowledge helps the business organization overcome future challenges and move closer to strategic objectives.&lt;ref name="Best practice"/&gt;

==Key points==
Management due diligence needs:
*Clear, defined objectives—set expectations in terms of management styles and qualities in individuals
* Commitment—assess whether management resources can make the business succeed.&lt;ref name=Meaning/&gt;
* Assess strengths—recognize strengths of individual members to use them effectively
The management team is an asset to any organisation,&lt;ref name="most important"&gt;{{cite web|title=The most important assets are not on the balance sheet|url=http://www.triplepundit.com/2010/09/the-most-important-assets-are-not-on-the-balance-sheet/|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations and drawbacks==

To assure reliable data, both investor and individuals under assessment must be involved in the feedback process. This can be costly and time-consuming to both parties. Since due diligence can be a detective game, organizations must find individuals who can detect small issues and opportunities. Organizations sometimes bring in outside experts.&lt;ref name="Main steps"&gt;{{cite web|title=Due Diligence: Main steps and success factors|url=http://www.gecapital.eu/en/docs/GE_Capital_Overview_Due_Diligence.pdf|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expense of the due diligence process, and the time involved, can be softened by dividing it into two stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PRELIMINARY DUE DILIGENCE (This is the 9th article in the series on M&amp;A) |url=http://businessthinker.com/preliminary-due-diligence-this-is-the-8th-article-in-the-series-on-ma/|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Due Diligence in mergers and acquisition|url=http://www.accountingcpd.net/Due_Diligence_in_Mergers_and_Acquisitions_by_Peter_Howson|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Executives may be so interested in a deal that they ignore identified risks and move ahead—and later suffer from management issues.&lt;ref name="Main steps"/&gt; 
Information gathering can involve interviewing the management team, but the team may see them as expensive and time-consuming.&lt;ref name="What is"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interviews|url=http://compass.port.ac.uk/UoP/file/d8a7aedc-be56-461b-85e8-ae38ccf49670/1/Interviews_IMSLRN.zip/page_03.htm|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People doing the analysis might not be familiar with the organization's sector, which can lead to wrong conclusions.&lt;ref name="most important"/&gt;

[[File:Margaret Morganroth Gullette Image.jpg|thumbnail|Margaret Morganroth Gullette Image]]
'''Margaret Morganroth Gullette''' (born 1941), a Resident Scholar at the Women's Studies Research Center at Brandeis University, is a cultural critic who calls herself an age critic and theorist. She is a prize-winning writer of nonfiction, an essayist, feminist, and activist. Her contributions to the field of [[cultural studies]] of age include four books, the latest of which is ''Agewise: Fighting the New Ageism in America'' (2011). Other books of Gullette's that have been influential (in humanistic and cultural gerontology, history, literary and cultural criticism, sociology and anthropology, performance and film studies, life writing and narrative theory, fashion studies, and feminist health activism) include ''Aged by Culture'' (2004), ''Declining to Decline: Cultural Combat and the Politics of the Midlife'' (1997); and ''Safe at Last in the Middle Years: The Invention of the Midlife Progress Novel''  (1988).

== Early life and education==
Margaret Morganroth was born in Brooklyn, NY, the first child of Betty Morganroth and Martin Morganroth. She was educated through high school at public schools and received scholarships to go to college and graduate school. Morganroth Gullette holds a B.A. magna cum laude [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from Radcliffe College, a M.A. from University of California, Berkeley, and a Ph.D. from Harvard University.

==Career==
Before becoming a Scholar in the Women's Studies Research Center in 1996, she had previously worked at the Harvard-Danforth Center for Teaching and Learning and had been a visiting scholar at Harvard; the Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe; Northeastern University; Wellesley Center for Research on Women. At the Danforth (now Bok) Center, she edited ''The Art and Craft of Teaching''. She continues to publish in the field of pedagogy and education. [citation needed]

Working in the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe, Gullette found a lost novel by the late nineteenth-century English feminist, Mona Caird, ''The Daughters of Danaus'', and wrote an introduction for the Feminist Press reissue. Early in the feminist second wave, she published a feminist children's book called ''The Lost Bellybutton'' (1976). [citation needed]

She was invited to be the George A. Miller Visiting Professor, at the Center for Advanced Studies, University of Illinois (Urbana/ Champaign), in the spring of 2000. She is an Advisory Editor to the new journal, ''Age, Culture, Humanities: An Interdisciplinary Journal'', and on the book series, Aging Studies in Europe  (LIT Verlag).  She is on the Advisory Committee of the European Network on Aging (ENAS).  She was on the Advisory Committee of the ''Journal of Aging, the Humanities, and the Arts'', 2006 2010 and co editor, Age Studies Series, University Press of Virginia, 1993 1999.

== Major ideas ==
Mike Hepworth, the late British cultural gerontologist (1957–2012), in a review of Gullette's work through 1999, calls her "one of America's foremost critics  of the concept of ageing as a universal and comprehensive process of decline. She is a formidable critic of biological essentialism, defender of [[social constructionism]], and opponent of 'middle ageism'" (Hepworth 1999, Abstract), and the author of an "increasingly influential range of publications on the social construction of ageing" (Hepworth 1999, 139) and the life course in the United States.  Gullette emerged during the 1990s and beyond as "the primary theorist and practitioner of what she called 'age studies'" (Cole and Ray 2010, 17).  Gullette named the field of "age studies" in 1993 (Gullette 1993, 45–46). The term is used by the Modern Language Association and in the humanities in preference to "aging studies."

"Her principal thesis is that we are aged by culture. What she means is that much of what we experience as we get older is not the ineluctable consequence of biological ageing . . . but is socially and culturally contingent. American society, she contends, has become a rich terrain on which the social and cultural exclusion of people as they age can take place and where the ideology of ageing can flourish" (Tulle 2006: 127). Age studies tries to understand age and aging as complex, intersectional social and psychological constructions, and also as a set of mediated relationships among people located at different phases of the life course.

"Age studies sees 'age' and 'aging' in culture as resulting as much from ideologies as from biology" (Ball 2006, 214).  Gullette has said that she offers a radical social constructionism that pushes "'the natural' out of context after context" (Gullette 1997 246 n42). "Neither Featherstone and Hepworth nor Gullette denied the existence of bodily ageing, although their work has at times been interpreted as coming near to doing so, with their emphasis on the cultural constitution of the body. . . . As a result, their work has been criticised by those who see it as endorsing a false dualism of the body and the self." (Twigg, 2007)

:: "Cultural critics like Gullette (1997, 1999) and Featherstone and Hepworth (1991) have traced the ways in which culture imposes negative meanings on the bodies of older people, which are then read back as the source of those meanings. For Gullette, we are aged not by our bodies but by culture; and the response should be one of challenge and resistance, as the [sub]title of her [1997] book [''Declining to Decline''], ''Cultural Combat'', makes clear" (Twigg, 2007, 298).

"Margaret Morganroth Gullette has documented ways in which the pervasive ageism of Western cultures is often coded into a narrative structure that associates old age with inevitable decline and decay. Although this 'decline ideology' might seem to work against the futurist assumption of redemptive hope, Gullette explains that we are trained to assume the decline of the old in order to make room for the more highly valued young. To counter this tendency, Gullette urges the proliferation of 'progress narratives,' which project 'a moving image of the self through its past and onward to its better future' (Port 2012, 5–6 ) One of her theoretical moves has been to undermine the binary between "progress narrative," automatically applied to children and younger people; and "decline narrative," automatically applied to people who have aged past midlife.

Gullette's term "age autobiography" is a call for individual authors to write more knowledgeably and critically about the mediated forces that insinuate themselves into our sense of "aging."  "And once we begin to think age, a more mysterious and intangible project emerges: to discover what our own culture is serving up for us, and what each of us has consumed or resisted" (Gullette 1993, 46). "The term itself ["the master narrative of aging"] was coined by Margaret Morganroth Gullette and is designed to identify a recognizable ensemble of cultural practices. . . " (Kunow 2011, 26).  The "master narrative of decline" requires a single self going through a linear trajectory, while "the portmanteau self" is "an active concept of aging as self narrated experience, the conscious, ongoing story of one's age identity"  (Gullette 1997: 220). Fragments of Gullette's own age autobiography appear in many of her nonfiction works. Cynthia Port singles out "one powerful essay [in which] Gullette argues that the fashion system teaches us to detach ourselves from and then discard clothes and other no longer fashionable commodities as a means of training ourselves for our own obsolescence in old age":  "The Other End of the Fashion Cycle: Practicing Loss, Learning Decline" (Port 2012, n26).

Gullette has been called  "one of gerontology's few public intellectuals," who demonstrates "how a scholar works to change the minds of general readers about aging and ageism" (Ray and Cole 2010: 8).   "The whole point, as Gullette (1988, 1993, 1997) has vividly shown in her analyses of fictional representations of ageing, is to discover how our personal ideas about ageing (positive/ negative/ ambiguous) are shaped by our culture and are therefore open to the possibility of change" (Hepworth 2000, 3). Convinced that our terminology about age is impoverished, she encourages the use of terms like "aging-past-youth," aging-into-the-middle years," and "aging-into-old age" (Gullette 1998, 3–44). She argues in several books (1997, 2004, 2011) that collective sociopolitical changes are necessary.

''Staging Age'', edited by Valerie Barnes Lipscomb and Leni Marshall, gives credit to Gullette's work in establishing the field of age studies, and advancing concepts about how age can be considered a performance (Lipscomb and Marshall 2010, 1–3). She invented the term "middle ageism" (Gullette 1998, 3–44)  to name the cluster of discriminations suffered by people in their middle years, from job discrimination to "Boomer-bashing" and decline discourse about sexuality, looks, and intellectual and cognitive competence. Other concepts developed by Gullette—such as "age ideology," "being aged by culture," and the use of "progress narrative" as a way out of the binary between "positive aging" and "decline narrative"—have been adopted by scholars in a range of disciplines.

Gullette's concepts and formulations have been disseminated through a number of chapters and essays or excerpts that have appeared in anthologies, including 
''A Guide to Humanistic Studies in Aging'' (2010), 
''Narratives of Life: Mediating Age'' (Munich 2009), 
''Opposing Viewpoints: The Aging Population'' (2009),  
''Sociology: Exploring the Architecture of Everyday Life. Readings'' (2008), 
''Coming of Age: First-Generation Critics Reflect on Age, Aging and the Making of Critical Gerontology'' (2008),

Working as a  freelance writer in parallel to her scholarly career, Gullette also publishes in mainstream, feminist, and progressive newspapers, magazines, and blogs.  These include  ''New York Times'' (Week in Review, Magazine, Arts), ''Nation'', ''Ms.'', ''Dissent'', ''Boston Globe'', ''Miami Herald'', ''Chicago Tribune''; ''American Prospect'', ''American Scholar''; and  www.womensenews; www.salon.com, www.theforward.com; www.nextavenue.com, www.ontheissuesmagazine.com  She has been interviewed on "Brian Lehrer," "The Callie Crossley Show," ''CultureShocks'', "The Connection," RadioNation, WBAI, "To the Best of Our Knowledge." 	

== Critical praise ==
"In breadth of vision, scholarly integrity, and the sheer exhilaration of her writing, Gullette's work is essential reading for all who wish to understand the origins of the transformation of midlife in our times and the possibility of real changes in attitudes to ageing--personal and social--under postmodern global capitalism" (Hepworth 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;143). "Gullette's gift for storytelling enthralls readers" (Achenbaum, 2011, 723). Gullette's chapter, 'Overcoming the Terror of Forgetfulness,' in ''Agewise'' was called "the best essay on memory loss that I have read. Based partly on the author's experiences with her mother, it reveals her deep compassion and insight" (Cruikshank 2011, 26).

== Honors and awards ==
''Agewise: Fighting the New Ageism in America'' (2011) won a 2012 Eric Hoffer Book Prize. ''Aged by Culture'' (2004), was chosen as a Noteworthy Book of the year by the ''Christian Science Monitor''. It was nominated for a Pulitzer and received an Honorable Mention from the Gustavus Myers Center for the Study of Bigotry and Human Rights. ''Declining to Decline: Cultural Combat and the Politics of the Midlife'' (1997) won the Emily Toth award in 1998 for the best feminist book on American popular culture.

Gullette has held fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the American Council of Learned Societies. She held a Bunting Fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute in 1986–87 while finishing ''Safe at Last in the Middle Years''.

Her essay, "The Contagion of Euphoria," won the [[Daniel Singer Millennial Prize]] in 2008. Other essays, frequently cited as notable in ''Best American Essays'', have appeared in many literary and cultural quarterlyes, including ''Kenyon Review'', ''Michigan Quarterly Review'', ''American Scholar'', and ''Yale Review''; and in scholarly journals like ''Feminist Studies'', ''Representations'', ''New Political Science'', ''Profession'', and the ''Journal of the History of Sexuality''.  Quotations from her books appear in ''The Quotable Woman: The First Five Thousand Years'' (2010).  She is a long-term member of PEN-America, to which she was nominated by Carolyn Heilbrun and Alix Kates Shulman.  In 2005 she won the Virginia Liebeler Biennial Grant for Mature Women in Letters from the National League of American Pen Women.

In 2012 Gullette won the Marigold "Ideas for Good" Prize, which carries an award of $5000, for her work as the co-founder and director of development for The Free High School for Adults, San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua, the sister city of Newton, MA, where she lives. She has been visiting Nicaragua since 1989, finding funding for adult education programs there.

[[File:MerchantMarkThomasHortonOfIlford.png|thumb|right|Merchant's mark of Thomas Horton (d.1530), wool merchant of Iford, Wiltshire, used on Wiltshire English woollens sent to Flanders. Engraved on a monumental brass ''circa'' 1520 in Bradford-on-Avon Church]]
A '''merchant's mark''' is an emblem or device adopted by a merchant, and placed on goods or produce sold by him in order to keep track of them, or as a sign of authentication. It may also be used as a mark of identity in other contexts.

==History==
Merchants' marks are as old as the sealings of the third millennium BCE found in [[Sumer]] that originated in the [[Indus Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;Seals were used to make impressions in wet clay as a means of sealing shipments of goods.  D. H. Kelley and B. Wells, "Recent Progress in Understanding the Indus Script", ''Review of Archaeology.'' Vol. 16, No. 1 : 15-23.(1995).&lt;/ref&gt;  Impressions of cloth, strings and other packing material on the reverse of tags with seal impressions indicate that the Harappan seals were used to control economic administration and trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harappa.com/script/indusscript.html  Asko Parpola, "Study of the Indus Script", p. 52. Paper read at the 50th ICES Tokyo Session on 19 May 2005 in Tokyo.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420012826/http://www.harappa.com/script/indusscript.html |date=20 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harappa.com/seal/7.html  Geoffrey Cook, "A Unicorn Seal", ''The Ancient Indus Civilization'' (on line).]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Amphora]]e from the [[Roman Empire]] can sometimes be traced to their sources from the inscriptions on their handles.  Commercial inscriptions in [[Latin]], known as [[Titulus pictus|Tituli picti]], appear on Roman containers used for [[trade]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5x5AoxAYBsgC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=titulus+pictus&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QKKuO8MhJA&amp;sig=6a8A3voRh9fy4oVYzxGa0ed9KW4#PPA106,M1  J. Theodore Peña, ''Roman Pottery in the Archaeological Record,'' p. 106. Cambridge U. Press (2007)] {{ISBN|0-521-86541-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic merchants' marks continued to be used by [[artisan]]s and [[townspeople]] of the [[medieval]] and [[early modern]] eras&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia L. Thrupp, ''The Merchant Class of Medieval London (1300-1500).'' U. Chicago (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; to identify themselves and authenticate their goods.  These distinctive and easily recognizable marks often appeared in their [[Seal (device)|seals]]&lt;ref&gt;http://medievalwriting.50megs.com/decoration/seal6.htm Medieval Writing&lt;/ref&gt; on documents and on products made for sale.  They are often found on [[headstone]]s and in works of [[stained glass]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cvma.ac.uk/content/books/browne/browne2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008190449/http://www.cvma.ac.uk/content/books/browne/browne2.htm |archivedate=8 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }} Corpus Vitrearum Medii Aevi - Browne's Chapel&lt;/ref&gt; brass&lt;ref&gt;http://medievalwriting.50megs.com/decoration/seal6.htm| Medieval Writing&lt;/ref&gt; and stone, serving in place of [[heraldic]] imagery, which could not be used by the [[middle class]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houseofnames.com/xq/asp/keyword.merchant%27s+mark/qx/symbolism_details.htm "merchant's mark", House of Names]&lt;/ref&gt;  They were the precursors of [[hallmark]]s, [[printer's mark]]s&lt;ref&gt;http://spencer.lib.ku.edu/sc/ptrsmark.shtml University of Kansas Libraries. Kenneth Specer Research Library. Special Collections.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[trademark]]s.

To manage the risks of piracy or shipwreck, merchants often consigned a cargo to several vessels or caravans; a mark on a bale established legal ownership and avoided confusion.  Early travellers, voyagers and merchants displayed their merchant's marks as well to ward off evil.   Adventurous travellers and sailors ascribed the terrors and perils of their life to the wrath of the [[Devil]].  To counter these dangers merchants employed all sorts of religious and magical means to place their caravans, ships and merchandise under the protection of God and His Saints.

[[Image:The Variety of 4 Marks.jpg|thumb|right|The Mystical Sign of Four, also called the "Staff of Mercury".]]

One such symbol combined the mystical "Sign of Four" with the merchant's name or initials.  The "Sign of Four"&lt;ref&gt;D. Christison, "The Carvings and Inscriptions on the Kirkyard Monuments of the Scottish Lowlands; particularly in Perth, Fife, Angus, Mearns, and Lothian," in ''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland,'' Volume 36 (1901-02): Fig. 114, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; was an outgrowth of an ancient symbol adopted by the Romans and by Christianity, [[Chi Rho]] (XP), standing for the first two letters of Christus in Greek letters; this was simplified to a reversed "4" in Medieval times.  The evolution of this symbol is shown in M. J. Shah's  article.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20091027143019/http://www.geocities.com/mjshah.geo/scinde/scinde.html  Scinde District Dawks - The Premier Stamps of Asia&lt;/ref&gt; The "Sign of Four" is called the "Staff of Mercury" ([[Caduceus]]) in German and Scandinavian literature on house marks.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Homeyer: ''Die Haus- und Hofmarken'', [[Berlin]] 1870, [http://www.labarum.se/media/gudstecken.pdf Tuve Skånberg: Glömda gudstecken. Från fornkyrklig dopliturgi till allmogens bomärken] (2003) under [[Creative Commons]] BY-NC-ND 2.5 licens Lund 2003, Anders Bjønnes : ''Segltegninger fra hyllingene i Norge 1591 og 1610'', Oslo 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[joint stock company]] or limited liability company was another way to reduce a merchant's risks of loss of ships and merchandise from dangerous voyages and travel.  By [[royal charter]] a monopoly was assured and a merchant's personal liability was limited to the amount of his own investment.  If a voyage succeeded the gains accrued to all of the investors in proportion to their invested capital shares.  Modern institutions, corporations and trademarks, find some of their origins in these symbolic and legal devices for limiting physical and pecuniary [[risks]].

== The East India Company's Merchant's Mark ==
[[Image:EIC Coin 1791 Half Pice.jpg|thumb|right|Symbols on East India Company Coin: 1791 Half Pice]]
[[image:Symbols on a Blue Scinde Dawk.jpg|right|thumb|Symbols on a Blue Scinde Dawk postage stamp (1852)]]

When the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] was chartered by [[Elizabeth I]], Queen of England in 1600 it was still customary for each merchant or [[Company of Merchant Adventurers of London|Company of Merchant Adventurers]] to have a distinguishing mark which included the "Sign of Four" and served as a trademark.  The East India Company's mark was made up from a '+', a '4' and the initials EIC.

This mark forms the central emblem displayed on the [[Scinde Dawk]] postage stamps.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027143019/http://www.geocities.com/mjshah.geo/scinde/scinde.html  "Scinde District Dawks - The Premier Stamps of Asia", excerpted by M. J. Shah from Manik Jain and S.B. Kothari, '''The Silver Key to The Golden Treasure of Indian Philately.''']&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it was a central motif of the East India Company's coinage.&lt;ref&gt;East India Company coin 1791, half pice, as illustrated.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The New Mobility Agenda''' is an international institution which, although a virtual and open collaborative project today, was originally set up by an international working group meeting at the [[Royaumont Abbey|Abbey de Royaumont]] near [[Paris]] in 1974 with the support of the Parisian [[OECD]] to challenge old ideas and practices in the field of urban transport through a long term collaborative program of information exchange, education and peer support. The Agenda today draws together the experience, expertise and support of more than four thousand individuals and groups worldwide in an open collaborative peer network. One of the original proponents of this approach, Professor [[Mikoto Usui]] then director of the OECD Development Centre, referred to it in the founding meeting at the "Abbé de Royaumont as an "invisible college".  Drawing together the experience and expertise of more than four thousand individuals and groups worldwide, who are networked via a combination of websites, discussion groups and fora, and collaborative projects, the Agenda takes an approach to transportation planning, policy and practice that has gained considerable force over the last two decades—provides a leading-edge alternative to earlier (20th century) methods of looking at and providing mobility for people and goods in cities.  The Agenda has received prestigious awards for its contributions, including the [[Stockholm Environment Challenge Prize]] (2000) and the [[World Technology Environment Award]] (2002).

Like the [[sustainable transportation]] movement,  to which it is closely related, it differs from previous methods (which in fact still dominate planning, policy, investment and operations in most parts of the world) in that it takes a global or broad [[systemic approach]] to the challenges of how to get around in cities, and is especially sensitive not only to pure transport efficiency (which traditionally is interpreted in pure engineering terms as speed and volume of vehicle throughput) but equally to matters of [[sustainable development]], [[pollution]] and [[Environmental degradation|environmental impacts]]—including matters relating to [[climate change]], the reduction of [[Greenhouse gas]]es, [[resource efficiency]], [[energy conservation]], [[public health]], both personal and public economics, overall [[time saving]]s, [[public spaces]], and [[quality of life]] in communities, including relations between people in public spaces – with particular attention to [[social justice]] and the unmet needs of women, children, and others with mobility or economic or health disadvantages which are not being properly served in our present mainly [[car-based systems]] and thinking, in which other forms of transport, including  [[public transport]], play only residual roles.

== New Mobility vs. Sustainable Transportation ==
These two are closely related but not identical concepts. The term "[[Sustainable Transportation]]" had it origins in the mid-eighties and has developed over time and for the most part with particular emphasis on informing transport and environmental policy, with support from a number of university programs, NGOs and from some international and government organizations. By contrast the term New Mobility Agenda takes the issues of sustainable transportation the other way around: by emphasizing the supply side—and specifically targets projects and programs which demonstrate and achieve the basic principles behind sustainable transportation.

== Targeted near-term improvements ==
A distinguishing aspect of the new mobility approach is its emphasis on the importance of targeted near-term improvements. It does not give up at all on long term thinking, but in response to what are increasingly understood to be unacceptable levels of pressure coming from current transportation arrangements, and the speed with which this degradation is taking place, there is a growing consensus that projects and measures should be targeting substantial improvements within a period of two or four years.  In most places this also coincides with the electoral terms of those in office, thus giving those elected an opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to more sustainable transportation arrangements.

== New Mobility and New Urbanism ==
These two movements share a common base of concern about the importance of bringing new approaches to the manner in which we structure our cities.   Both key on facilitating the move to more economically and environmentally efficient higher density communities.  Collaboration between the two independent programs is just getting underway

== In Brief ==
The New Mobility Agenda looks for and coordinates a complex ''bouquet'' of overlapping mobility services in an attempt to offer a high quality multi-level alternative – or complement – to the mostly car-based transport system of the city. Services most often incorporated into this multi-level alternative transport system include: [[Travel avoidance]], [[land use planning]], [[mixed use]], [[Transportation Demand Management]], [[Telecommuting]], [[Telework]], [[e-work]], [[Public space]] management, [[Shared space]], [[Human-powered transport]], [[Walking]] and [[Walkability]] , [[Pedestrianization]], [[Promenadology]], [[Traffic Calming]], [[Cycling]], [[public bicycle systems]], [[utility cycling]], [[public transit priority systems]], [[Bus rapid transit]], [[Car diets/reduction plans]],  [[HOV]], [[Intelligent transportation system]], LOV ([[Low-Occupancy Vehicle]]), [[Park and ride]], [[Parking]], [[Road diets]], [[Single-occupancy vehicle|SOV]], [[Single Occupancy Vehicle]], [[Toll roads]],   [[Car rental]] , [[Car Free Days]], [[Carpooling]], [[Carsharing]],  [[flexible working]], [[flextime]], [[Hitch-hiking]],   [[Share taxi#Jitney|Jitney]], [[Midibus]], [[Mini-bus]], [[xTransit]],   [[Public transport]], [[Ride sharing]], [[economic instruments]], [[Congestion charging]], [[road pricing]], [[Full cost pricing]],  [[Roller skating]], [[Self-Organizing Collaborative Networks]], [[Share taxi]]s, [[Taxicab]],  [[Vanpooling]].

The individual components of ‘new mobility’, transportation modes and policies including those listed just above, are in generally broadly well understood and defined, at least at the leading edge. But what makes the whole an "agenda" stems from the fact that new mobility policies are based on the development and orchestration of extensive packages of measures which need to be brought on line over time and as experience and demonstrated competence with these new approaches develops. Hence the totality is referred to as an "agenda"

Continental Europe is leading the way in understanding and implementing the New Mobility Agenda, and the increasingly higher quality of their transportation systems performance and their life quality and environmental impacts are immediately visible to both visitors and those who live there.  German, Swiss, Dutch, Austrian, Danish, and increasingly the cities of France, Belgium, Northern Italy, and the rest of Scandinavia are joining in the new mobility/quality of life sweepstakes, driven as much by pride and strong local leadership as by purely negative factors (those these are many and important movers as well). A process has been engaged in Europe which other parts of the world are looking at and starting to emulate: cities increasingly looking at themselves and each other scanning for good ideas that they can take home and adapt for their communities.  This is thus an example of a virtuous spiral.  The [[European Commission]] has played an important supporting role in this process.

== Terminology ==
To appreciate fully what "[[new mobility]]" means, it is useful to see how it differs from "Old Mobility" (often defined as being stuck in traffic, waiting in the rain for a bus that may never come, or paying large amounts of taxpayer dollars for "improvements" that ultimately find us still late for work or waiting for that bus. (See the multi-media presentation of  A Day In The Life of New Mobility for one characterization of how it might look in day-to-day life in one city.)

What we now call  "old mobility’ thinking and practice is in effect the dominant paradigm of 20th century visions and practices. It is/was essentially oriented to the search for engineering, technological and infrastructural solutions for increasing speed and throughput capacity in specific links and at key points (including bottlenecks). The old mobility paradigm was one that has been characterized as "forecast (growth) and build".  Old mobility solutions more often than not cost a lot of money, and created a broadly shared mind-set in which the main limit to providing for yet further capacity increases within the system was constrained only by funding limitations from public sources. The old system was and is essentially hierarchical and "expert oriented and controlled". It is still dominant in many cities and parts of the world today.

(Since this entry is still in progress, here is an attempt to characterize the present arrangements and constraints that form it very broadly. By understanding these – if (a) true and (b) really a problem – we have a base for fine-tuning our proposed new solutions.  So, here is how old mobility looks from the specific vantage of the proponents of the New Mobility Agenda:

# Based on an essentially closed system (looking at "transport" in isolation from the rest)
# Hierarchical
# Top-down
# Centralized
# Statistics based (historical)
# Bounded
# Reductive
# End-state solution oriented
# Authoritarian
# Supply oriented
# Oriented to maximizing vehicle throughput and speeds
# Expert based
# Engineering-based (i.e., working "within the box", but with high technical competence)
# Binary: i.e., either "private" (i.e., car-based) or "public" transport (and nothing of importance in between)
# De facto car-based
# Costly to the community (unnecessarily)
# Costly to individuals (unnecessarily)
# Resource intensive (unnecessarily)
# Total dependence on costly imported fossil fuels (unnecessarily)
# Highly polluting
# Massive public health menace
# Destroys urban fabric
# Hardware and build solutions, technology oriented
# Treats ex-car solutions as (very!) poor cousins
# Offers poor service/economic package to elderly, handicapped, poor and young
# Sharp divide between planning, policy and operations
# Obscure (to the public) decision making processes
# Focuses on bottlenecks impeding traffic flows (i.e., builds for &gt; traffic)
# Attempts to anticipate them and build to forestall
# Searches for large projects to "solve" the problems
# These large projects and the substantial amounts involved often lead to corruption and waste of public moneys
# Still too much separation from underlying land use realities.
# Inadequate attention to transportation substitutes or complements
# Increasingly technical and tool oriented (this to the good)
# Anachronistic,
# Not doing the job that we need in 2005 and beyond!, and finally and worst of all. . .
# Creates a climate of passive citizenry and thus undermines participatory democracy and collective involvement and problem solving

The heart of new mobility policy by contrast is [[systemic complexity]], diversity, participation, wide outreach and a wide array of [[partnerships]] and other forms of synergistic interaction and collaboration.  It more often involves the orchestration of a large number of measures and policies, many of which often very small in themselves, in order to provide a dispersed modern city encompassing many different types of people and mobility needs – as opposed to the "big solution" approaches often favored in the past (whether major highway or [[road building]] or extensions, new [[Rapid transit]] ([[metros]], [[Subway (rail)|subways]] or other expensive [[rail systems]], massive central parking structures, and the like).  The goal of the planners and authorities changes radically with this new paradigm, such that rather than "solving problems" with centrally planned and executed engineering and measurement; they start to get more involved in multi-level complex problem-solving, which brings them to such quite different kinds of approaches such as community outreach and orchestration of services and the participation of a much larger number of actors and players.

The New Mobility Agenda addresses the issues on both the supply and demand sides. It thus combines Transportation Demand Management [[Transportation Demand Management|TDM]] strategies and measures for containing, channeling and limiting wasteful and encumbering private car traffic in cities, with coordinated support of a wide "bouquet" of alternative transportation arrangements.  These include various forms of [[Human-powered transport]], [[utility cycling]], [[walking]], [[public space]] improvement, electronic substitutes for travel (such as [[telework]], [[telecommuting]] or [[e-work]]) and a variety of shared and [[public transport]] strategies, new and old, including [[HOV]] (High Occupancy Vehicles), [[carpooling]], [[ride sharing]], [[car rentals]], [[taxicab]], [[Share taxi]], [[Share taxi#Jitney|Jitney]]s, and the list goes on (see long list of modes and component parts in '''Internal Links''' below).

== History ==
What is today known as the New Mobility Agenda has had many antecedents and both before and since has proceeded in many places and on many fronts as [[traffic congestion]] and more generally the weight and poor performance—environmental, economic, social, and destruction of urban fabric—of the old, mainly car-based mobility system has increasingly made itself felt in city after city around the world.  Unsurprisingly the worst problems we are seeing today are in the cities of the developing countries, and most of all in their megacities – in most of which the old mobility thinking continues to carry the day in policy and investment circles who are proving slow to adjust. Over the last two decades this movement has steadily gained force to the point where  a growing array of programs and authorities are coming together in an attempt to create more balanced transportation systems, better equipped for dealing with the highly diverse mobility needs of people of all social and economic classes in the 21st century. (See references below for some of these.)

The '''New Mobility Agenda''' provides an example of a focused, international [[Self-Organizing Collaborative Network]] applied to the challenges of transport in cities. And while its antecedents are as old as the first time anyone got stuck in traffic and wondered about how things might be better organized, the actual "New Mobility Agenda" by that name was formally kicked off in 1996 during the [[OECD]] International Conference in [[Vancouver]] [[Canada]] (24–27 March 1996) under the title ''Towards Sustainable Transportation''.

In the wake of the 1996 ''Towards Sustainable Transportation'' conference, two things happened immediately which started to give concrete expression to this new movement.

* Working in cooperation with the [[OECD]]'s program [[EST – Environmentally Sustainable Transportation]] program a long-standing open expert forum organized on the topic area under [[The Commons: Open Society Sustainability Initiative]] in 1974 decided to relaunch their existing STEP program (Sustainable Transportation Emergency Program) with the name ''New Mobility Agenda''.  This program and its extensions today  bring together more than four thousand international experts and activists working in this area, and is guided by an  International Advisory Council. These individuals and groups are at work to develop a common frame of information and understanding mediated by a collection of exchange mechanisms, including a whole series of web sites, blogs, newsgroups, and periodic conferences, both physical and using the latest low cost video and voice conferencing techniques.
* In parallel the City of [[Toronto]] launched a program, Moving the Economy with an explicit  "New Mobility" Strategy, which continues to be active.  The City has also created its own New Mobility HUB Network, which is supported by a New Mobility HUB Survey which can be usefully applied with only minor adaptations to any other community.

== Collaborative New Mobility city projects, 1 Sept. 2007 update ==

Recent collaborative projects that are presently (early 2007) getting considerable attention in specialist and policy circles around the world, include the relaunching of the Journal of World Transport Policy and Practice include the continuation of the [[Toronto]] (Canada) New Mobility Hub regional network and their latest Seamless Link program. In parallel the open group has launched the New Mobility Advisory/Briefs program which is aimed specifically to engage mayors and city leaders to give more attention to low cost remedial measures and projects offering near term relief. The Agenda has also recently created a handful of open video libraries which can be accessed via ''New Mobility Video Library.''

The New Mobility program is in its work supporting the 1 August 2006 call of  the Clinton Climate Initiative for 80% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reductions in cities over the next ten – fifteen years.  While not affiliated with the Clinton project, that is primarily looking at technology-based reforms in the largest world cities, the New Mobility program is concentrating on strategies to bring about major institutional  reforms and a massive repartitioning of the transportation arrangements of cities of all sizes, including in the high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sprawl areas that surround center cites.

The following cities are currently looking at eventual New Mobility projects and strategies: Paris, Stuttgart, Chicago, Washington DC, New York City, Vancouver, Santa Barbara (CA).

'''''Nulla poena sine lege''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "no penalty without a law") is a [[Law|legal]] principle, requiring that one cannot be punished for doing something that is not prohibited by law. This principle is accepted and codified in modern democratic states as a basic requirement of the [[rule of law]].&lt;ref&gt;A description and analysis of the principle can be found in [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1347126 Shahram Dana, Beyond Retroactivity to Realizing Justice: The Principle of Legality in International Criminal Law Sentencing, 99 JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL LAW AND CRIMINOLOGY 857 (2009) ]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "one of the most 'widely held value-judgement[s] in the entire history of human thought{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]] in ''[[Rogers v. Tennessee]]'', citing J. Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law 59 (2d ed. 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
In modern European criminal law, e.g. of the [[Constitutional Court of Germany]], the principle of ''nulla poena sine lege'' has been found to consist of four separate requirements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boot|first=M.|title=Genocide, Crimes Against Humanity, War Crimes: Nullum Crimen Sine Lege and the Subject Matter Jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court|year=2002|publisher=Intersentia|isbn=9789050952163|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6QjrSHfoEiAC&amp;pg=PA94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Nulla poena sine &lt;u&gt;praevia&lt;/u&gt; lege poenali'': There is to be no penalty without ''previous'' law. This prohibits [[ex post facto law]]s, and the retroactive application of criminal law. It is a basic [[Maxim (saying)|maxim]] in [[continental Europe]]an legal thinking. It was written by [[Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach]] as part of the Bavarian Criminal Code in 1813.

;''Nulla poena sine lege &lt;u&gt;scripta&lt;/u&gt;'': There is to be no penalty without ''written'' law. That is, criminal prohibitions must be set out in written legal instruments of general application, normally [[statute]]s, adopted in the form required by constitutional law. This excludes [[customary law]] as a basis of criminal punishment.

;''Nulla poena sine lege &lt;u&gt;certa&lt;/u&gt;'': There is to be no penalty without ''well-defined'' law. This provides that a penal statute must define the punishable conduct and the penalty with sufficient definiteness to allow citizens to foresee when a specific action would be punishable, and to conduct themselves accordingly. The rule expresses the general principle of [[legal certainty]] in matters of criminal law. It is recognised or codified in many national jurisdictions, as well as e.g. by the [[European Court of Justice]] as a "general principle of [[Law of the European Union|Union law]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klip|first=André|title=Substantive Criminal Law of the European Union|year=2011|publisher=Maklu|isbn=9789046604403|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KrkY5eZ36zAC&amp;pg=PA69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Nulla poena sine lege &lt;u&gt;stricta&lt;/u&gt;'': There is to be no penalty without ''exact'' law. This prohibits the [[Analogy#Law|application by analogy]] of statutory provisions in criminal law.

==In common law==
One complexity is the lawmaking power of judges under [[common law]]. Even in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems that do not admit judge-made law, it is not always clear when the function of interpretation of the criminal law ends and judicial lawmaking begins.

In [[English criminal law]] there are offences of [[common law]] origin. For example, [[murder]] is still a [[common law offence]] and lacks a statutory definition. The [[Homicide Act 1957]] did not include a statutory definition of murder (or any other homicidal offense). Therefore, the definition of murder was the subject of no fewer than six appeals to the House of Lords within the next 40 years (''Director of Public Prosecutions v. Smith'' [1961] A.C. 290; ''Hyam v. Director of Public Prosecutions'' [1975] A.C. 55; ''Regina v. Cunningham'' [1982] A.C. 566; ''Regina v. Moloney'' [1985] A.C. 905; ''Regina v. Hancock'' [1986] A.C. 455; ''Regina v. Woollin'' [1998] 4 A11 E.R. 103 (H.L.)).

== In natural law ==
The legal principle ''nulla poena sine lege'' as principle in natural law is due to the contention of scholars of the [[Scholasticism]] about the preconditions of a guilty conscience. In relation to the [[Ezekiel]]-commentary of [[Jerome|Sophronius Eusebius Hieronymus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Patrologiae cursus completus {{!}} sive bibliotheca universalis, integra, uniformis, commoda, oeconomica, omnium ss. patrum, doctorum scriptorum que ecclesiasticorum qui ab aevo apostolico ad usque Innocentii III tempora floruerunt (...) Series Latina, accurante J.-P. Migne, Patrologiae Tomus XXV. S. Eusebius Hieronymus. (…) Excudebat Migne (...).|last=Hieronymus|first=Sophronius Eusebius|publisher=|year=1884|isbn=|location=|pages=col. 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Francisco Suárez]] analysed the formal conditions of the punishment of [[conscience]]. Thomas located the conditions within the [[Synderesis|synderesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Summa Theologiae Ia|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=q. LXXIX art. XII. resp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him it is a formal and active part of the human soul. Understanding of activity, which is in accordance with the human nature, is formal possible due to the synderesis. Hence the synderesis contains in the works of patristic authors a law which commands how the human as human has to act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Patrologiae cursus completus {{!}} sive bibliotheca universalis, integra, uniformis, commoda, oeconomica, omnium ss. patrum, doctorum scriptorum que ecclesiasticorum qui ab aevo apostolico ad tempora concilii tridentini pro latinis et cconcilii florentini pro graecis floruerunt (...) Series Graeca Prior, accurante J.-P. Migne, Patrologiae Graecae Tomus XCIV. S. Joannes Damascenus (…) Excudebat Migne.|last=Damascenus|first=Joannes|publisher=|year=1864|isbn=|location=|pages=col. 1199}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the individual case this law is contentual definite. For the scholastic this is shown in the action of the intellect. This action is named since Thomas ''conscientia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Summa Theologiae Ia|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=q.LXXIX a.XIII. resp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A possible content of the ''conscientia'' is the punishment in concordance with the content of the synderesis, in case the human has had not act in concordance with the human nature. An example for the punishment is madness, which since antiquity is a punishment of conscience. The [[Oresteia]] is a famous example for this.

According Suárez the punishment of conscience is the insight in an obligation to act in concordance with the human nature to undo a past misdeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Suárez, Opera Omnia. Editio nova, A D. M. André, Canonico Repullensi ,(...) Thomus Quartus. Parisiis: Ludovicum Vivès, Tractatus Tertius. De bonitate et malitia humanorum actuum.|last=Suárez|first=Francisco|publisher=|year=1865|isbn=|location=|pages=Disputatio XII. Sectio II. n.1, 439.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This insight obligates to impossible actions due to the fact that the misdeed is in the past and hence it is unchangeable. Therefore the ''conscientia'' obligates in concordance with the synderesis to do an impossible action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=De bonitate et malitia humanorum actuum.|last=Suárez|first=Francisco|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Disputatio XII. sectio IV. n.729–35, 445.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the ''conscientia'' restricts conscientious persons by doing a limitation on their own will.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Summa Theologiae Ia|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=q. XLVIII. Art. V. resp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For they are unable to think about any other action than to fulfil their obligation. Inasmuch the conscientia restricts the intellect the scholastic speak of it as a ''malum'' or ''malum metaphysicum'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Summa Theologiae Ia|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=q. XLVIII. Art. V. resp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the limitation is related to a metaphysical quality of a human. The law is constituted by the human nature itself from what the ''malum metaphysicum'' is inflicted. Therefore the punishment of the conscience is executed because of a violation of [[natural law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simmert|first=Sebastian|date=2016|title=Nulla poena sine lege. Etiam sine lege poena est conscientia.|url=|journal=Rechtsphilosophie - Zeitschrift für Grundlagen des Rechts.|volume=3|pages=283–304|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In cases of universal jurisdiction==
The question of [[jurisdiction]] may sometimes come to contradict this principle. For example, [[customary international law]] allows the prosecution of [[pirate]]s by any country (applying [[universal jurisdiction]]), even if they did not commit crimes at the area that falls under this country's law. A similar principle has appeared in the recent decades with regard to crimes of [[genocide]] (see [[genocide#Genocide as a crime under domestic law|genocide as a crime under domestic law]]); and [[UN Security Council Resolution 1674]] "reaffirms the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 [[World Summit Outcome Document]] regarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity"&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/UNISPAl.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/e529762befa456f8852571610045ebef!OpenDocument Resolution 1674 (2006)]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223154915/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAl.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/e529762befa456f8852571610045ebef!OpenDocument |date=February 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; even if the State in which the population is being assaulted does not recognise these assaults as a breach of domestic law. However, it seems that universal jurisdiction is not to be expanded substantially to other crimes, so as to satisfy ''Nulla poena sine lege''.

Since the [[Nuremberg Trials]], [[penal law]] is taken to include the prohibitions of international criminal law, in addition to those of [[domestic law]]. The [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1347126 normative content of nulla poena] in international law is developed by Shahram Dana in "Beyond Retroactivity to Realizing Justice: The Principle of Legality in International Criminal Law Sentencing" published in 99 JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL LAW AND CRIMINOLOGY 857 (2009).  Thus, prosecutions have been possible of such individuals as [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[war criminal]]s&lt;ref&gt;[[Nuremberg Principles]] I &amp; II state; "Any person who commits an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible therefore and liable to punishment." and "The fact that internal law does not impose a penalty for an act which constitutes a crime under international law does not relieve the person who committed the act from responsibility under international law" respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; and officials of the [[German Democratic Republic]] responsible for the [[Berlin Wall]],&lt;ref&gt;Case of Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v. Germany (Applications nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98) (2001) 33 E.H.R.R. 31&lt;/ref&gt; even though their deeds may have been allowed or even ordered by domestic law. Also, courts when dealing with such cases will tend to look to the letter of the law at the time, even in regimes where the law as it was written was generally disregarded in practice by its own authors.

However, some legal scholars criticize this, because generally, in the legal systems of Continental Europe where the maxim was first developed, "penal law" was taken to mean [[Statutory law|statutory]] penal law, so as to create a guarantee to the individual, considered as a fundamental right, that he would not be prosecuted for an action or omission that was not considered a crime according to the statutes passed by the legislators in force at the time of the action or omission, and that only those penalties that were in place when the infringement took place would be applied. Also, even if one considers that certain actions are prohibited under general principles of international law, critics point out that a prohibition in a general principle does not amount to the establishment of a crime, and that the rules of international law also do not stipulate specific penalties for the violations.

In an attempt to address those criticisms, the statute of the recently established [[International Criminal Court]] provides for a system in which crimes and penalties are expressly set out in written law, that shall only be applied to future cases.

This principle is enshrined in several national constitutions, and a number of international instruments. See e.g. [[European Convention on Human Rights]], article 7(1); Rome Statute of the [[International Criminal Court]], articles 22 and 23.&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite journal|last=Popple|first=James|author-link=James Popple|title=The right to protection from retroactive criminal law|year=1989|journal=Criminal Law Journal|volume=13|number=4|pages=251–62|issn=0314-1160|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/~James.Popple/publications/articles/retroactive/clj.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=no|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orientation''' is a function of the [[mind]] involving awareness of three dimensions: [[time]], [[Location (geography)|place]] and [[person]].&lt;ref&gt;Berrios G E (1982) Disorientation States in Psychiatry. ''Comprehensive Psychiatry'' 23: 479-491&lt;/ref&gt; Problems with orientation lead to ''dis''orientation, and can be due to various conditions, from [[delirium]] to [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]]. Typically, disorientation is first in time, then in place and finally in person.

==Assessment==
{{manual|section|date=September 2017}}
In the context of an accident or major trauma, the [[emergency medical technician#Emergency Medical Responder|Emergency Medical Responder]] performs spiraling (increasingly detailed) assessments which guide the critical first response. Assessment of mental orientation typically lands within the immediate top three priorities: 
# '''Safety''' - Assess the area safety (potential traffic, fire, overhead/underfoot objects and collapse risks, rushing water, gunfire, chemical/radiation threats, storm conditions, downed power lines, etc.), wait for the threat to subside, or move the person to safety if and when possible, all without endangering oneself. 
# '''ABCs''' - Note conscious or unconscious then assess '''A'''irway, '''B'''reathing and '''C'''irculation factors (with priority to any potential gross or debilitating blood loss.)
# '''Orientation''' - Determine if the person is ''"awake, alert, and oriented, times three (to person, place, and time)."'' This is frequently abbreviated '''AAOx3''' which also serves as a mnemonic. The assessment involves asking the patient to repeat his own full name, his present location, and today's date. The assessment is best done right up front, ahead of moving or transporting the victim, because it may illuminate potential internal damage.
#'''Event/Situation'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pgu.edu/downloads/mental-status-exam.pdf|title=LICENSED PROFESSIONALS PRACTICE DESCRIPTION - MENTAL STATUS EXAM|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52389268|title=Handbook of psychological assessment|last=Gary.|first=Groth-Marnat,|date=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0471420182|edition= 4th|location=Hoboken, N.J.|oclc=52389268}}&lt;/ref&gt; - A fourth category is now used as well. If the person is oriented to what is going on around them, then they are said to be '''AAOx4'''. AAOx3 is not a concerning response since people are sometimes less aware of the situation due to pain, time of day, or lack of significant event.

Alternately, the letters in AAOx4 can be documented as '''COAX4'''. A person who is COAx4 is said to be "conscious, alert, &amp; oriented to person, place, time and event". When a handoff report is made, anything less than 4 is specifically noted for clarity (e.g., patient is COAx2, oriented to place and self).

Mental orientation is closely related, and often intermixed with trauma shock, including physical shock (see: [[Shock (circulatory)]]) and mental shock (see: [[Acute stress reaction]], a psychological condition in response to terrifying events.)

The exact [[brain|cerebral]] region involved in orientation is uncertain, but lesions of the [[brain stem]] and the [[cerebral hemisphere]]s have been reported to cause disorientation, suggesting that they act together in maintaining awareness and its subfunction of orientation.

==Disorientation==
{{expand section|date=September 2017}}
Disorientation is the opposite of orientation.  It is a cognitive disability in which the senses of time, direction, and [[Recognition (sociology)|recognition]] of items (things), people and places become difficult to distinguish/identify.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac M., Janca A., Sartious N., 1994.''ICD-10 Symptom Glossery For Mental Disorders,''10th ed. WHO.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of mental disorientation==
Disorientation can occur in healthy young adults as well as in the elderly or ill person. While exercising, if a person becomes dehydrated as a result of over-exertion, he or she may become disoriented to the time or place. While exercising, the body may not be able to supply enough oxygen to the brain fast enough.  Mental disorientation can be the aim of some performance art, as creators with 'audience disorientation' as a goal may work to deliberately augment sensations of time, place, person, purpose.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

A '''Photoshop contest''', or sometimes '''Photoshop battle''', is an [[online]] game, in which a [[website]] or user of an [[Internet forum]] will post a starting [[image]] — usually a [[photograph]] — and ask others to manipulate the image using some kind of [[computer graphics|graphics]] editing [[software]], such as [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[Corel Photo-Paint]], The [[GIMP]], [[PaintShop Pro]], [[Paint.NET]] or [[Paint (software)|Microsoft Paint]].   People can also use [[video editing]] software to create these images, such as [[Adobe Premiere Pro]] or [[VideoPad Video Editor|NCH VideoPad]].

While [[Photoshop (verb)|Photoshop]] is the industry standard image editing program, [[Adobe Systems]], the publisher of Photoshop, [[Adobe Photoshop#Cultural impact|discourages use]] of "Photoshop" to refer to anything other than their photo editing software, to prevent their [[trademark]] from becoming [[Generic trademark|generic]].

A large part of the humor in many of these contests involves the use of [[internet meme]]s.

Such contests have recently seen increasing participation on many blogs and forums. The popular internet community [[Reddit]] has a community called /r/photoshopbattles devoted to the contests.

A more "underground" variety of these image manipulation jokes involves the blending of celebrity faces with nude or [[pornography|pornographic]] images, often combined with references to movies, music, magazines and other forms of related [[popular culture]].

==Photoshop tennis==
'''Photoshop tennis''' (also known as '''Photoshop Pong''' or '''Photoshop battle''' (similar in its function to a "[[Turntablism#Turntablist contests|DJ battle]]" in [[hip hop music]]) is a game played through sequential alternating photoshopping of an [[image]]. Photoshop tennis originated in graphics-related [[internet forum]]s in the late-1990s/early-2000s, and shares an earlier history with online image games such as [[SITO]]'s "PANIC" (started January, 1994).&lt;ref name="SITOpanic"&gt;[http://www.sito.org/docs/tennis.html SITO Panic and Photoshop Tennis]&lt;/ref&gt;  The game was made popular by art director Jim Coudal in 2001 as "Photoshop Tennis".&lt;ref name="wiredtennis"/&gt; The matches on coudal.com have since been renamed '''Layer Tennis''',&lt;ref name="layertennis"&gt;[http://www.layertennis.com/ Coudal Partners' Layer Tennis]&lt;/ref&gt; as they are no longer restricted to the use of Adobe Photoshop.

Each match of Photoshop tennis is generally played with two competing players.&lt;ref name="wiredtennis"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2001/09/47132

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The players pick a starting image, or one is "served" by a player, then another player makes some sort of alteration to the image in any chosen image editor (matches are not exclusive to Adobe Photoshop). They then send the altered image to the other player or players, usually via [[e-mail]] or by posting the image to a Photoshop tennis forum, who then edits that image and sends it back to the first player. This process goes back and forth until a predetermined number of rounds have elapsed, or the players otherwise wish to end the game. When the final round is over, there may be an independent [[judge]] who determines who has played the best shots, and declares that person the winner, or players may play without a clear winner. Sometimes extra rules can be enforced, such as sticking to one particular [[Computer software|software package]], or keeping to a particular [[Motif (visual arts)|theme]]. &lt;!-- // Context of this sentence?

[[Image:IAO-logo.png|thumb|180px|[[Information Awareness Office]] seal with its motto ''scientia est potentia'']]
[[File:Zn_sila_logos.svg|thumb|180px|Logos science magazine [[:ru:Знание — сила|''Znanie — sila'']] ([[USSR]]/[[Russia]]) - in translation "Knowledge is power".]]
The phrase "'''''scientia potentia est'''"'' (or "'''''scientia est potentia'''''" or also "'''''scientia potestas est'''")'' is a [[Latin]] [[aphorism]] meaning "knowledge is power".  It is commonly attributed to [[Sir Francis Bacon]], although there is no known occurrence of this precise phrase in Bacon's English or Latin writings. However, the expression "''ipsa scientia potestas est"'' ('knowledge itself is power') occurs in Bacon's ''Meditationes Sacrae'' (1597). The exact phrase "''scientia potentia est"'' was written for the first time in the 1668 version of the work ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' by [[Thomas Hobbes]], who was secretary to Bacon as a young man.

The related phrase "''sapientia est potentia"'' is often translated as "wisdom is power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2004/f/speciale/altri/2004censis/dariofo/dariofo.html|title=Knowledge like challenge to every form of powers|author=Dario Fo|website=repubblica.it|date=June 13, 2004|language=italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins and parallels===

The earliest documented occurrence of the phrase "Knowledge is power" is from Imam [[Ali]] (599-661 CE), as recorded in the tenth-century book [[Nahj Al-Balagha]] (originally in Arabic). He said:

{{Quote|text=Knowledge is power and it can command obedience. A man of knowledge during his lifetime can make people obey and follow him and he is praised and venerated after his death. Remember that knowledge is a ruler and wealth is its subject.|sign=[[Imam Ali]]|source=''[[Nahj Al-Balagha]]'', Saying 146}}

Another account of this concept is found in the [[Shahnameh]] by the Persian poet [[Ferdowsi]] (940–1020 CE) who wrote: "Capable is he who is wise" (in [[Persian language|Persian]]: توانا بود هر که دانا بود).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shahnameh, first poem, couplet 14. توانا بود هر که دانا بود ز دانش دل پیر برنا بود knowledge is power with the knowledge, the heart of the old people will be young (Ferdowsi)  e.f.|url=http://shahnameh.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[hemistich]] is translated to English as "knowledge is power" or "One who has wisdom is powerful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.persianmirror.com/Article_det.cfm?id=1425&amp;getArticleCategory=59&amp;getArticleSubCategory=35 |title=The Modern Magazine for Persian Weddings, Cuisine, Culture &amp; Community |publisher=Persianmirror.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307171627/http://www.persianmirror.com/Article_det.cfm?id=1425&amp;getArticleCategory=59&amp;getArticleSubCategory=35 |archivedate=2012-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proverb in practically the same wording is found in Hebrew, in the Biblical [[Book of Proverbs]] (24:5): גֶּבֶר-חָכָם בַּעוֹז;    וְאִישׁ-דַּעַת, מְאַמֶּץ-כֹּחַ. This was translated in the latin [[Vulgata]] as "''vir sapiens et fortis est et vir doctus robustus et validus''"&lt;ref&gt;Biblia Sacra Vulgata, [https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Biblia_Sacra_Vulgata_%28Stuttgartensia%29/Proverbia  Proverbia]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[King James Version]], the first English official edition, as "A wise man is strong, a man of knowledge increaseth strength".&lt;ref&gt;Holy Bible, King James Version, [http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/1611-Bible/book.php?book=Proverbs&amp;chapter=24&amp;verse=5 Proverbs 24:5]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas Hobbes===
&lt;!--The Latin phrase "Scientia potentia est" does not appear at all in''De Homine'' (1658), chapter X. Instead, it does appear Leviathan (1668), section De Homine (of man), chapter X. --&gt;
The first known reference of the exact phrase appeared in the Latin edition of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1668; the English version had been published in 1651). This passage from Part 1 ("De Homine"), Chapter X ("De Potentia, Dignitate et Honore") occurs in a list of various attributes of man which constitute power; in this list, "sciences" or "the sciences" are given a minor position:
{{quote|''Scientia potentia est, sed parva; quia scientia egregia rara est, nec proinde apparens nisi paucissimis, et in paucis rebus. Scientiae enim ea natura est, ut esse intelligi non possit, nisi ab illis qui sunt scientia praediti''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''Opera philosophica...'', [https://archive.org/details/operaphilosophi03molegoog Volume III] (''Leviathan'' [1668]), [https://archive.org/stream/operaphilosophi03molegoog#page/n80/mode/2up p. 69]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the English version this passage reads as thus:
{{quote|''The sciences are small powers; because not eminent, and therefore, not acknowledged in any man; nor are at all, but in a few, and in them, but of a few things. For science is of that nature, as none can understand it to be, but such as in a good measure have attained it.''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''The English Works of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury...'', [https://archive.org/details/englishworkstho10hobbgoog Volume 3] (Leviathan), [https://archive.org/stream/englishworkstho10hobbgoog#page/n90/mode/2up p. 75].&lt;/ref&gt;}}
   
On a later work, ''[[De Corpore]]'' (1655), also written in Latin, Hobbes expanded the same idea:
{{quote|''The end or scope of philosophy is, that we may make use to our benefit of effects formerly seen ... for the commodity of human life ... The end of knowledge is power ... lastly, the scope of all speculation is the performing of some action, or thing to be done.''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes ''De Corpore'', Part I, Chapter I (''On Phylosophy''). In Thomas Hobbes, ''The English Works of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury...'', [https://archive.org/details/englishworkstho21hobbgoog Volume I], [https://archive.org/stream/englishworkstho21hobbgoog#page/n32/mode/2up p. 7]. From the Latin edition: Thomas Hobbes, ''Opera philosophica...'', [https://archive.org/details/operaphilosophi04molegoog Volume 1], [https://archive.org/stream/operaphilosophi04molegoog#page/n132/mode/2up p. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In Jean Hampton, ''Hobbes and the social contract tradition'' (1988), Hampton indicates that this quote is 'after Bacon' and in a footnote, that 'Hobbes was Bacon's secretary as a young man and had philosophical discussions with him (Aubrey 1898, 331).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayinsci.com/H/Hobbes_Thomas/HobbesThomas-Quotations.htm |title=Thomas Hobbes Quotes - 14 Science Quotes - Dictionary of Science Quotations and Scientist Quotes |publisher=Todayinsci.com |date=2012-01-19 |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Francis Bacon===
[[Image:Francis Bacon 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sir Francis Bacon]], "''ipsa scientia potestas est"'' (knowledge itself is power). ''Meditationes Sacrae'' (1597).]]
The closest expression in Bacon's works is, perhaps, the expression "''scientia potestas est''", found in his ''[[s:Meditationes sacrae|Meditationes Sacrae]]'' (1597), which is perhaps better translated as "knowledge is His power", because the context of the sentence refers to the qualities of God and is imbedded in a discussion of heresies that deny the power of God:
''statuuntque latiores terminos scientiae Dei quam potestatis, vel potius ejus partis potestatis Dei (nam et ipsa scientia potestas est) qua scit, quam ejus qua movet et agit: ut praesciat quaedam otiose, quae non praedestinet et praeordinet''.

The English translation of this section includes the following:

: "This canon is the mother of all canons against heresies. The cause of error is twofold : ignorance of the will of God, and ignorance or superficial consideration of the power of God. The will of God is more revealed through the Scriptures… his power more through his creatures… So is the plenitude of God’s power to be asserted, as not to involve any imputation upon his will. So is the goodness of his will to be asserted, as not to imply any derogation of his power. 
: "… Atheism and Theomachy rebels and mutinies against the power of God ; not trusting to his word, which reveals his will, because it does not believe in his power, to whom all things are possible… But of the heresies which deny the power of God, there are, besides simple atheism, three degrees…

: "The third degree is of those who limit and restrain the former opinion to human actions only, which partake of sin: which actions they suppose to depend substantively and without any chain of causes upon the inward will and choice of man; and who give a wider range to the knowledge of God than to his power; or rather to that part of God’s power (for knowledge itself is power) whereby he knows, than to that whereby he works and acts ; suffering him to fore know some things as an unconcerned looker on, which he does not predestine and preordain : a notion not unlike the figment which Epicurus introduced into the philosophy of Democritus, to get rid of fate and make room for fortune; namely the sidelong motion of the Atom; which has ever by the wiser sort been accounted a very {{nowrap|empty device." (pp.&amp;nbsp;94–95; ''Works of Bacon'',}} Vol XIV, Boston; Brown and Taggard, 1861)

Interpretation of the notion of power meant by Bacon must therefore take into account his distinction between the power of knowing and the power of working and acting, the opposite of what is assumed when the maxim is taken out of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vickers|first=Brian|title=Francis Bacon and the Progress of Knowledge|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|year=1992|volume=53|issue=3|pages=495–518|jstor=2709891}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the quotation has become a [[cliche]].

In another place, Bacon wrote,  "Human knowledge and human power meet in one; for where the cause is not known the effect cannot be produced. Nature to be commanded must be obeyed; and that which in contemplation is as the cause is in operation as the rule."&lt;ref&gt;Francis Bacon, ''[[Novum Organum]]'', Part I, Aphorism III. Boston:  Taggard &amp; Thompson, 1863, volume  VIII, pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ralph Waldo Emerson ===
[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] wrote in his essay ''Old Age'', included in the collection ''Society and Solitude'' (1870):

{{quote|''Skill to do comes of doing; knowledge comes by eyes always open, and working hands; and there is no knowledge that is not power.''&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Waldo Emerson, ''Society and Solitude'', 1892, [https://archive.org/stream/acj9362.0001.001.umich.edu#page/302/mode/2up p. 303]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Wissen ist Macht in Germany ===
After the 1871, [[unification of Germany]], "''Wissen ist Macht, geographisches Wissen ist Weltmacht''" (Knowledge is power, geographical knowledge is world power) was often used in German geography and the public discussion to support efforts for a [[German colonial empire]] after 1880. [[Justus Perthes|Julius Perthes]] e.g., used the motto for his [[Justus Perthes (publishing company)|publishing house]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article638877/Geographie-als-Weltmacht.html | title=Geographie als Weltmacht  Klett und Perthes werben für ein "Museum der Erde" in Gotha | publisher=Die Welt | date=24 June 1997 | accessdate=29 August 2014 | author=ALEXANDER U. MARTENS}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the installation of geographical research followed popular requests and was not imposed by the government.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially [[Count Otto von Bismarck|Count Bismarck]] was not much interested in German colonial adventures; his envoy [[Gustav Nachtigal]] started with the first protective areas, but was more interested in ethnological aspects.

After World War I, German geography tried to contribute to efforts to regain a world power. Scholars like [[Karl Haushofer]], a former general, and his son [[Albrecht Haushofer]] (both in close contact with Rudolf Hess) got worldwide attention with their concept of geopolitics. Associations of German geographers and school teachers welcomed the [[Machtergreifung]] and hoped to get further influence in the new regime.

The postwar geography was much more cautious; concepts of political geography and projection of power had not been widespread scholarly topics till 1989 in Germany.

Geographical knowledge is however still of importance in Germany. Germans tend to mock US politicians' and celebrities' comparable lack of interest in the topic. A Sponti ([[Außerparlamentarische Opposition]]) version of the slogan is "Wissen ist Macht, nichts wissen, macht auch nichts", a pun about the previous motto along the line "Knowledge is power, but being ignorant doesn't bother anyway". [[Joschka Fischer]] and [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] belong to those Spontis that nevertheless held powerful positions, in Fischer's case with no more formal education than a taxi driver's licence.

The German Bundeswehr Bataillon Elektronische Kampfführung 932, an [[electronic warfare]] unit based in [[Frankenberg (Eder)]], still uses the Latin version ''Scientia potentia est'' as its motto.

==Interpretation==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
Though its meaning varies from author to author, the phrase often implies{{according to whom|date=February 2017}} that with knowledge or [[education]], one's potential or abilities in life will certainly increase. Having and sharing knowledge is widely recognized as the basis for improving one's reputation and influence, thus power. This phrase may also be used as a justification for a reluctance to share information when a person believes that withholding knowledge can deliver to that person some forms of advantage. Another interpretation is that the only true power is knowledge, as everything (including any achievement) is derived from it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19944">{{Network neutrality}}

'''Search neutrality''' is a [[principle]] that [[search engine]]s should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, [[impartial]] and based solely on [[relevance]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/28/opinion/28raff.html | title=Search, but You May Not Find | publisher=The New York Times | year=2009 | accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that when a user queries a search engine, the engine should return the most relevant results found in the provider's domain (those sites which the engine has knowledge of), without manipulating the order of the results (except to rank them by relevance), excluding results, or in any other way manipulating the results to a certain [[bias]]. 
 
Search neutrality is related to [[network neutrality]] in that they both aim to keep any one organization from limiting or altering a user's access to services on the Internet. Search neutrality aims to keep the [[organic search]] results (results returned because of their relevance to the search terms, as opposed to results sponsored by advertising) of a search engine free from any manipulation, while network neutrality aims to keep those who provide and govern access to the Internet from limiting the availability of resources to access any given content.

==Background==
The term "search neutrality" in context of the internet appears as early as March 2009 in an academic paper by Andrew Odlyzko titled, "Network Neutrality, Search Neutrality, and the Never-ending Conflict between Efficiency and Fairness in Markets"&lt;ref name="odlyzko"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Odlyzko|first1=Andrew|title=Network Neutrality, Search Neutrality, and the Never-ending Conflict between Efficiency and Fairness in Markets|journal=Review of Network Economics|date=March 2009|pages=40-60|url=https://www.bsi.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/rne81.pdf|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In this paper, Odlykzo predicts that if net neutrality were to be accepted as a legal or regulatory principle, then the questions surrounding search neutrality would be the next controversies. Indeed, in December 2009 the New York Times published an opinion letter by Foundem co-founder and lead complainant in an anti-trust complaint against Google, Adam Raff, which likely brought the term to the broader public. According to Raff in his opinion letter, search neutrality ought to be "the [[principle]] that [[search engines]] should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, [[impartial]] and based solely on [[relevance]]"&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/28/opinion/28raff.html | title=Search, but You May Not Find | publisher=The New York Times | year=2009 | accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  On October 11, 2009, Adam and his wife Shivaun launched SearchNeutrality.org, an initiative dedicated to promoting investigations against Google's search engine practices &lt;ref name=raff1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.searchneutrality.org/about|website=searchneutrality.org|title=About SearchNeutrality.org|accessdate=4 July 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804021604/http://www.searchneutrality.org/about|archivedate=4 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There, the Raffs note that they chose to frame their issue with Google as "search neutrality" in order to benefit from the focus and interest on net neutrality&lt;ref name="raff1" /&gt;.

In contrast to net neutrality, answers to such questions, as "what is search neutrality?" or "what are appropriate legislative or regulatory principles to protect search neutrality?", appear to have less consensus. The idea that neutrality means equal treatment, regardless of the content, comes from debates on net neutrality &lt;ref name=grimmelmann&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1742444|title=Some Skepticism about Search Neutrality|work=The Next Digital Decade: Essays on the Future of the Internet|last1=Grimmelmann|first1=James|pages=435-461|accessdate=5 July 2017 }} &lt;/ref&gt;. Neutrality in search is complicated by the fact that search engines, by design and in implementation, are not intended to be neutral or impartial. Rather, search engines and other [[information retrieval]] applications are designed to collect and store information (indexing), receive a query from a user, search for and filter relevant information based on that query (searching/filtering), and then present the user with only a subset of those results, which are ranked from most relevant to least relevant (ranking). "Relevance" is a form of bias used to favor some results and rank those favored results. Relevance is defined in the search engine so that a user is satisfied with the results and is therefore subject to the user's preferences. And because relevance is so subjective, putting search neutrality into practice has been so contentious.

Search neutrality became a concern after [[search engines]], most notably [[Google]], were accused of search bias by other companies.&lt;ref name="jolt.law.harvard.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lao|first1=Marina|title="Neutral" Search As A Basis for Antitrust Action?|journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology Occasional Paper Series|date=July 2013|pages=1–12|url=http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/antitrust/articles/Lao.pdf|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitors and companies claim search engines systematically favor some sites (and some kind of sites) over others in their lists of results, disrupting the objective results users believe they are getting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herman|first1=Tavani|editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N.|title=Search Engines and Ethics|journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=2014|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/ethics-search/|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The call for search neutrality goes beyond traditional search engines. Sites like [[Amazon.com]] and [[Facebook]] are also accused of skewing results.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shavin|first1=Naomi|title=Are Google and Amazon the next threat to net neutrality?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/naomishavin/2014/07/02/are-google-and-amazon-the-next-threat-to-net-neutrality/|website=Forbes.com|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazon’s search results are influenced by companies that pay to rank higher in their search results while Facebook filters their newsfeed lists to conduct social experiments.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"/&gt;

== "Vertical search" spam penalties ==
In order to find information on the Web, most users make use of [[search engines]], which [[web crawler|crawl the web]], index it and show a list of results ordered by relevance. The use of search engines to access information through the web has become a key factor for [[online business]]es companies, which depend on the flow of users visiting their pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marketingtoday.com/emarketing/0305/b2b_importance_sem.htm| title=Search Engine Marketing | publisher=Marketing Today | year=2005 | accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these companies is Foundem. Foundem provides a "[[vertical search]]" service to compare products available on online markets for the U.K. Many people see these "vertical search" sites as spam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antitrust nemesis accuses Google of 'WMD program'|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/01/foundem_accuses_google_of_wmd_program_against_vertical_search_rivals/|work=The Register|publisher=The Register|accessdate=2 August 2012|author=Cade Metz|date=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2006 and for three and a half years following, Foundem’s traffic and business dropped significantly due to what they assert to be a penalty deliberately applied by Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.searchneutrality.org/foundem-google-story| title=Foundem’s Google Story| publisher=www.searchneutrality.org| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127070002/http://www.searchneutrality.org/foundem-google-story |archivedate=27 January 2010 | year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear, however, whether their claim of a penalty was self-imposed via their use of iframe HTML tags to embed the content from other websites.  At the time at which Foundem claims the penalties were imposed, it was unclear whether web crawlers crawled beyond the main page of a website using iframe tags without some extra modifications. The former SEO director OMD UK, Jaamit Durrani, among others, offered this alternative explanation, stating that “Two of the major issues that Foundem had in summer was content in iFrames and content requiring javascript to load – both of which I looked at in August, and they were definitely in place. Both are huge barriers to search visibility in my book. They have been fixed somewhere between then and the lifting of the supposed ‘penalty’. I don’t think that’s a coincidence.”&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title = Foundem vs Google redux: it was a penalty!

Most of Foundem’s accusations claim that Google deliberately applies penalties to other vertical search engines because they represent competition.&lt;ref name="policyBlog"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2010/02/committed-to-competing-fairly.html | title=Committed to competing fairly| publisher=[[Google]] | year=2010 | accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foundem is backed by a Microsoft proxy group, the 'Initiative for Competitive Online Marketplace'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Conducting Antitrust Review of Google|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/204857/texas_conducting_antitrust_review_of_google.html|work=PC World|publisher=IDG Consumer and SMB|accessdate=2 August 2012|author=Nancy Gohring|date=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other cases====
[[Google]]'s large market share (85%) has made them a target for search neutrality litigation via [[antitrust laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.searchneutrality.org/ | title=Background to EU Formal Investigation | publisher=foundem | date=November 30, 2010 | accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, Google released an article on the Google Public Policy blog expressing their concern for fair competition, when other companies at the UK joined Foundem's cause (eJustice.fr, and Microsoft's Ciao! from Bing) also claiming being unfairly penalized by Google.&lt;ref name="policyBlog" /&gt;

===The FTC’s Investigation into Allegations of Search Bias===

After two years of looking into claims that Google “manipulated its search algorithms to harm vertical websites and unfairly promote its own competing vertical properties,” the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) voted unanimously to end the antitrust portion of its investigation without filing a formal complaint against Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Agrees to Change Its Business Practices to Resolve FTC Competition Concerns In the Markets for Devices Like Smart Phones, Games and Tablets, and in Online Search|url=http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/01/google-agrees-change-its-business-practices-resolve-ftc|website=FTC.gov|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=20 November 2014|date=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FTC concluded that Google’s “practice of favoring its own content in the presentation of search results” did not violate U.S. antitrust laws.&lt;ref name="jolt.law.harvard.edu"/&gt; The FTC further determined that even though competitors might be negatively impacted by Google's changing algorithms, Google did not change its algorithms to hurt competitors, but as a product improvement to benefit consumers.&lt;ref name="jolt.law.harvard.edu"/&gt;

== Arguments ==
There are a number of arguments for and against search neutrality.

=== Pros ===
* Those who advocate search neutrality argue that the results would not be biased towards sites with more advertising, but towards sites most relevant to the user.&lt;ref name="Concurring Opinions"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/2011/02/search-neutrality-as-disclosure-and-auditing.html | title=Search Neutrality as Disclosure and Auditing | publisher=Concurring Opinions | date=February 19, 2011 | accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Search neutrality encourages sites to have more quality content rather than pay to rank higher on organic results.
* Restrains search engines from only supporting their best advertisers.&lt;ref name="Concurring Opinions"/&gt;
* Search engines would allow traffic to sites that depend on visitors, keeping their results comprehensive, impartial, and based solely on relevance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/28/opinion/28raff.html?_r=1 | title=Search, but You May Not Find | publisher=Bucknell.edu | date=December 27, 2009 | accessdate=February 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann"&gt;{{cite book | last=Grimmelmann | first=James | chapterurl=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&amp;context=james_grimmelmann | title=The Next Digital Decade: Essays on the Future of the Internet | chapter=Some Skepticism About Search Neutrality | publisher=TechFreedom | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Allows for organized, logical manipulation of search results by an objective, automatic algorithm.  At the same time, disallowing underhanded ranking of results on an individual basis.&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann"/&gt;
* Personalized search results might suppress information that disagrees with users' [[worldview]]s, isolating them in their own cultural or ideological "[[filter bubble]]s".&lt;ref name=twsT43&gt;{{cite news|first1= Lynn | last1= Parramore|title= The Filter Bubble|work= The Atlantic|quote= Since Dec. 4, 2009, Google has been personalized for everyone. So when I had two friends this spring Google "BP," one of them got a set of links that was about investment opportunities in BP. The other one got information about the oil spill....|date=  October 10, 2010|url= https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2010/10/the-filter-bubble/181427/|accessdate= April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cons ===
*Forcing search engines to treat all websites equally would lead to the removal of their biased look at the Internet. A biased view of the Internet is exactly what search users are seeking. By performing a search the user is seeking what that search engine perceives as the "best" result to their query. Enforced search neutrality would, essentially, remove this bias. Users continually return to a specific search engine because they find the "biased" or "subjective" results to fit their needs.&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann" /&gt;
*Search neutrality has the possibility of causing search engines to become stagnant. If site A is first on a [[Search engine results page|SERP]] (search engine results page) one month, and then tenth the next month search neutrality advocates cry "foul play," but in reality it is often the page's loss in popularity, relevance, or quality content that has caused the move. The case against Google brought forth by the owners of Foundem extoll this phenomenon and regulation could limit the search engine's ability to adjust ranking based on their own metrics.&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann" /&gt;
*Proponents of search neutrality desire transparency in a search engine's ranking algorithm. Requiring transparent algorithms leads to two concerns. These algorithms are the companies private [[intellectual property]] and should not be forced into the open. This would be similar to forcing a soda manufacturer to publish their recipes. The second concern is that opening the algorithm would allow spammers to exploit and target how the algorithm functions directly. This would permit spammers to circumvent the metrics in place that prevent spammed websites from being at the top of a SERP.&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann" /&gt;
*Removing a search engine's ability to directly manipulate rankings limits their ability to penalize dishonest websites that practice [[Black hat hacking|black hat]] techniques to improve their rankings. Any site who finds a way to circumvent the algorithm would benefit from a search engine's inability to manually decrease their ranking causing a spam site to gain high ranking for extended periods of time.&lt;ref name="Grimmelmann" /&gt;

[[Google]]’s "[[Google Search|Universal Search]]" system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google 2.0: Google Universal Search|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-20-google-universal-search-11232|work=Search Engine Land|publisher=Third Door Media, Inc|accessdate=2 August 2012|author=Danny Sullivan|date=16 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been identified as one of the least neutral search engine practices,{{according to whom|date=November 2011}} and following the implementation of Universal Search websites, such as [[MapQuest]], the company experienced a massive decline in web traffic. This decline has been attributed to Google linking to its own services rather than the services offered at external websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/universalsearch_20070516.html | title=Google Begins Move to Universal Search | publisher=[[Google]] | date=May 17, 2007| accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://searchengineland.com/google-maps-gaining-on-market-leader-mapquest-13103 | title=Google Maps Gaining On Market Leader Mapquest | publisher=Search Engine Land | date=January 10, 2008 | accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these claims, Google actually displays Google content on the first page, while rival search engines do not considerably less often than Microsoft's Bing which displays Microsoft content when rivals do not. Bing displays Microsoft content in first place more than twice as often as Google shows Google content in first place. This indicates that as far as there is any 'bias', Google is less biased than its principal competitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defining and Measuring Search Bias:  Some Preliminary Evidence|url=http://www.laweconcenter.org/images/articles/definingmeasuring.pdf|work=Defining and Measuring Search Bias:  Some Preliminary Evidence|publisher=International Center for Law and Economics|accessdate=2 August 2012|author=Joshua D.

The '''Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984''' (or '''SCPA''') is an act of the [[US Congress]] that makes the [[IC layout|layouts]] of [[integrated circuit]]s legally protected upon registration, and hence illegal to copy without permission.

==Background==
Prior to 1984, it was not necessarily illegal to produce a competing chip with an identical layout. As the legislative history for the SCPA explained, patent and copyright protection for chip layouts, chip ''topographies'', was largely unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;The Senate Report on the bill (S.Rep. No. 425, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. (1984)) stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the semiconductor industry, innovation is indispensable; research breakthroughs are essential to the life and health of the industry. But research and innovation in the design of semiconductor chips are threatened by the inadequacies of existing legal protection against piracy and unauthorized copying. This problem, which is so critical to this essential sector of the American economy, is addressed by the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984.... [The bill] would prohibit "chip piracy"--the unauthorized copying and distribution of semiconductor chip products copied from the original creators of such works.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Quoted in [http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/977/1555/304802/ Brooktree Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.], 977 F.2d 1555, ¶ 17 (Fed. Cir. 1992). See also ''Brooktree'', ¶¶ 21-22 (copyright and patent law ineffective).&lt;/ref&gt; This led to considerable complaint by U.S. chip manufacturers—notably, Intel, which, along with the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), took the lead in seeking remedial legislation—against what they termed "chip piracy." During the hearings that led to enactment of the SCPA, chip industry representatives asserted that a pirate could for $10,000 copy a chip design that had cost its original manufacturer upwards of $100,000 to design.

==Enactment of US and other national legislation==
In 1984 the United States enacted the '''Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984''' (the ''SCPA'') to protect the topography of semiconductor chips. The SCPA is found in  title 17, U.S. Code, sections 901-914 ([http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap9.html  17 U.S.C. §§ 901-914]).

Japan&lt;ref&gt;Japan was the first country to enact its own version of the SCPA, the Japanese "Act Concerning the Circuit Layout of a Semiconductor Integrated Circuit" of 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; and European Community (EC) countries soon followed suit&lt;ref&gt;In 1986 the EC promulgated a directive requiring its members to adopt national legislation for the protection of semiconductor topographies. Council Directive 1987/54/EEC of 16 Dec. 1986 on the ''Legal Protection of Topographies of Semiconductor Products'', art. 1(1)(b), 1987 O.J. (L 24) 36.&lt;/ref&gt; and enacted their own, similar laws protecting the topography of semiconductor chips.&lt;ref&gt;The UK enacted the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act, 1988, c. 48, § 213, after it initially took the position that its copyright law fully protected chip topographies. See [[British Leyland Motor Corp. v. Armstrong Patents Co.]]

Criticisms of inadequacy of the UK copyright approach as perceived by the US chip industry are summarized in [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=04089472 Further chip rights developments], Micro Law, IEEE Micro, Aug. 1985, pp. 91-92.

Australia passed the Circuit Layouts Act of 1989 as a ''sui generis'' form of chip protection. Korea passed the ''Act Concerning the Layout-Design of Semiconductor Integrated Circuits''&lt;/ref&gt;

Chip topographies are also protected by TRIPS, an international treaty.&lt;ref&gt;On Jan. 1, 1995, the ''Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights'' (TRIPs) (Annex 1C to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement), went into force. Part II, section 6 of TRIPs protects semiconductor chip products and was the basis for Presidential Proclamation No. 6780, March 23, 1995, under SCPA § 902(a)(2), extending protection to all present and future WTO members.&lt;/ref&gt;

==How the SCPA operates==
===''Sui generis'' law===
Although the U.S. SCPA is codified in title 17 (copyrights), the SCPA is not a [[copyright]] or [[patent]] law. Rather, it is a ''[[sui generis]]'' law resembling a [[utility model]] law or ''[[Gebrauchsmuster]]''. It has some aspects of copyright law, some aspects of patent law, and in some ways, it is completely different from either.  From ''Brooktree'', ¶ 23: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984 was an innovative solution to this new problem of technology-based industry. While some copyright principles underlie the law, as do some attributes of patent law, the Act was uniquely adapted to semiconductor mask works, in order to achieve appropriate protection for original designs while meeting the competitive needs of the industry and serving the public interest.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In general, the chip topography laws of other nations are also ''sui generis'' laws. Nevertheless, copyright and patent [[case law]] illuminate many aspects of the SCPA and its interpretation.

===Acquisition of protection by registration===
Chip protection is acquired under the SCPA by filing with the US Copyright Office an application for "mask work" registration under the SCPA, together with a filing fee. The application must be accompanied by identifying material, such as pictorial representations of the IC layers so that in the event of infringement litigation, it can be determined what the registration covers. Protection continues for ten years from the date of registration.

===Mask works===
The SCPA repeatedly refers to "mask works." The term is a relic of the original form of the bill that became the SCPA and was passed in the Senate as an amendment to the Copyright Act. The term mask work is parallel to and consistent with the terminology of the 1976 Copyright Act, which introduced the concept of "literary works," "pictorial works," "audiovisual works," and the like and protected physical embodiments of such works, such as books, paintings, video game cassettes, and the like against unauthorized copying and distribution. The terminology became unnecessary when the House of Representatives insisted on the substitution of a ''sui generis'' bill, but the SCPA as enacted still continued its use.&lt;ref&gt;See generally Thomas Hoeren, Francesca Guadagno, and Sacha Wunsch-Vincent, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291791824_Breakthrough_technologies_-_Semiconductor_innovation_and_intellectual_property ''Breakthrough Technologies – Semiconductors, Innovation and Intellectual Property''], {{smallcaps|WIPO Econ. Rsch. Working Paper No. 27}} (Nov. 2015), p. 28 (discussing introduction of term "mask work"). Hoeren discusses, ''id''. n.143, the insistence of Copyright Office General Counsel Dorothy Schrader that the copyright version of the SCPA must have a "work" to be protected, in accordance with the concept of the 1976 Copyright Act. The proponents of chip protection responded, Hoeren recounts: "She wants a 'work'? OK, she can have a 'mask work' if that will satisfy her." So that 'work' went into the next draft of the Senate bill. The mask work concept had nothing to do with ''sui generis''. It was an attempt to assimilate the chip protection sought to the copyright pattern of literary works, pictorial works, musical works,
etc. But once in the Senate bill it stayed in and was carried over to the subsequent House bill."&lt;/ref&gt; The term "mask work" is not limited to actual masks used in chip manufacture but is defined broadly in the SCPA to include the topographic creation embodied in the masks and chips. Moreover, the SCPA protects any physical embodiment of a mask work.&lt;ref&gt;The SCPA, [(17 U.S.C. § 901(a)(2))], defines a '''mask work''' as "a series of related images, however fixed or encoded, having or representing the predetermined, three-dimensional pattern of metallic, insulating, or semiconductor material present or removed from the layers of a semiconductor chip product, and in which the relation of the images to one another is such that each image has the pattern of the surface of one form of the semiconductor chip product."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enforcement===
The owner of mask work rights may pursue an alleged infringer ("chip pirate") by bringing an action for mask work infringement in federal district court. The remedies available correspond generally to those of copyright law and patent law.

===Functionality unprotected===
The SCPA does not protect functional aspects of chip designs, which is reserved to [[Patent|patent law]]. Although EPROM and other memory chips topographies are protectable under the SCPA, such protection does not extend to the information stored in chips, such as computer programs. Such information is protected, if at all, only by [[Copyright|copyright law]].

===Reverse engineering allowed===
The SCPA permits competitive emulation of a chip by means of [[reverse engineering]]. The ordinary test for illegal copying (mask work infringement) is the "[[substantial similarity]]" test of copyright law,&lt;ref&gt;''Brooktree'', ¶¶ 31-33.&lt;/ref&gt; but when the defense of reverse engineering is involved and supported by probative evidence (usually, the so-called paper trail of design and development work), the similarity must be greater.&lt;ref&gt;''Brooktree'', ¶¶ 48-66.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the accused chip topography must be substantially identical (truly copied by rote, so-called slavish copying) rather than just substantially similar for the defendant to be liable for infringement.&lt;ref&gt;See Explanatory Memorandum, Mathias-Leahy Amendments to S. 1201, 130 Cong. Rec. S12, 91617 (daily ed. Oct. 3, 1984). See also [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/977/977.F2d.1555.91-1259.91-1258.html Brooktree Corp. v.

Rev. 385, 406 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Most world chip topography protection laws provide for a reverse engineering privilege.

The '''six-hour clock''' is a traditional timekeeping system used in the [[Thai language|Thai]] and formerly the [[Lao language]] and the [[Khmer language]], alongside the official [[24-hour clock]]. Like other common systems, it counts twenty-four [[hour]]s in a day, but divides the day into four quarters, counting six hours in each. The hours in each quarter (with the exception of the sixth hour in each quarter) are told with period-designating words or phrases, which are:

*... ''mong chao'' ({{lang-th|...โมงเช้า}}, {{IPA-th|mōːŋ tɕʰáːw|}}) for the first half of daytime (07:00 to 11:59)
*''Thiang'' ... (เที่ยง) for 12:00 to 12:59
*''Bai'' ... ''mong'' ({{lang|th|บ่าย...โมง}}, {{IPA|[bàːj mōːŋ]}}) for the latter half of daytime (13:00 to 18:59)
*... ''thum'' ({{lang|th|...ทุ่ม}}, {{IPA|[tʰûm]}}) for the first half of nighttime (19:00 to 23:59)
*''Thiang Khuen'' (เที่ยงคืน) 24:00
*''Ti'' ... ({{lang|th|ตี...}}, {{IPA|[tīː]}}) for the latter half of nighttime (01:00 to 06:59)

These terms are thought to have originated from the sounds of traditional timekeeping devices. The [[gong]] was used to announce the hours in daytime, and the drum at night. Hence the terms ''mong'', an [[onomatopoeia]] of the sound of the gong, and ''thum'', that of the sound of the drum. ''Ti'' is a verb meaning ''to hit or strike'', and is presumed to have originated from the act of striking the timekeeping device itself.&lt;ref name="Unlocked"&gt;{{citation|last=Thongprasert|first=Chamnong|chapter=ทุ่ม-โมง-นาฬิกา (Thum-Mong-Nalika)|title=ภาษาไทยไขขาน (Thai Unlocked)|publisher=Prae Pitaya Press|place=Bangkok|year=1985|pages=229–237|url=http://www.royin.go.th/th/knowledge/detail.php?ID=1273|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726014744/http://www.royin.go.th/th/knowledge/detail.php?ID=1273|archivedate=2009-07-26|df=}}. {{th icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chao'' and ''bai'' translate as ''morning'' and ''afternoon'' respectively, and help to differentiate the two daytime quarters.

The sixth hours of each quarter are told by a different set of terms. The sixth hour at dawn is called ''yam rung'' ({{lang|th|ย่ำรุ่ง}}, {{IPA|[jâm rûŋ]}}), and the sixth hour at dusk is called ''yam kham'' ({{lang|th|ย่ำค่ำ}}, {{IPA|[jâm kʰâm]}}), both references to the act of striking the gong or drum in succession to announce the turning of day (''yam''), where ''rung'' and ''kham'', meaning ''dawn'' and ''dusk'', denote the time of these occurrences. The midday and midnight hours are respectively known as ''thiang'' ({{lang|th|เที่ยง}}, {{IPA|[tʰîaːŋ]}}, or ''thiang wan'', {{lang|th|เที่ยงวัน}}, {{IPA|[tʰîaːŋ wān]}}) and ''thiang khuen'' ({{lang|th|เที่ยงคืน}}, {{IPA|[tʰîaːŋ kʰɯ̄ːn]}}), both of which literally translate as ''midday'' and ''midnight''.

Midnight is also called ''song yam'' ({{lang|th|สองยาม}}, {{IPA|[sɔ̌ːŋ jāːm]}}; note that ''yam'' is a different word), a reference to the end of the second three-hour period of the night watch (''song'' translates as the number ''two''). In addition, ''hok (6) thum'' and ''ti hok'' may also be used to refer to the hours of midnight and dawn, following general usage for the other hours, although more rarely; and the fourth to sixth hours of the second daytime half may also be told as ...''mong yen'' ({{lang|th|...โมงเย็น}}, {{IPA|[mōːŋ jēn]}}), ''yen'' meaning ''evening''.

The system has been used in some form since the days of the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]],{{citation needed|date=February 2009}} but was codified similarly to its present form only in 1901 by King [[Chulalongkorn]] in ''Royal Gazette'' 17:206.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=ประกาศใช้ทุ่มโมงยาม|periodical=Royal Gazette|date=29 July 1901|issue=17|page=206|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2443/018/206.PDF|accessdate=2008-10-18}}. {{th icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, it is used only in [[colloquial speech]]. However, a corrupted form of the six-hour clock is more frequently encountered,&lt;ref name="Unlocked" /&gt; where usually the first half of daytime (including the sixth hour of the preceding quarter) is counted as in the [[twelve-hour clock]], i.e. ''hok (6) mong chao'', ''chet (7) mong'', etc., up to ''sip et (11) mong''.

The six-hour clock system was abolished in [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] during the [[French protectorate of Cambodia|French protectorate]], and the French 24-hour clock system (for example, 3h00) has been used.

A comparison of the systems is as follows:

==History==
The [[Workers' Party of Korea|Korean Workers' Party]] [[Politburo]] passed a decree in 1957 entitled “On the Transformation of the Struggle with Counterrevolutionary Elements into an All-People All-Party Movement,” which established the policy and programs for conducting its first large-scale purges of North Korean society.&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Lankov, “The Repressive System And The Political Control In North Korea,” in Severnaia Koreia: vchera i segodnia (North Korea: Yesterday and Today) (Moscow: Vostochnaia literatura, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; The May 30th Resolution and the KWP’s Intensive Guidance Project provided the basis for songbun’s socio-political classification of the entire North Korean population by dividing the entire citizenry into three distinct loyalty groups based on family background: "friendly", "neutral", and "enemy" forces.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Yong-gu, “North Korean Residents’ Songbun,” 70-75; and Andrei Lankov, “The Repressive System And The Political Control In North Korea”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
&lt;!-- Note 1957, KWP factions? --&gt;
{{quotebox|quote=Tomatoes, which are completely red to the core, are considered worthy Communists; apples, which are red only on the surface, are considered to need ideological improvement; and grapes are completely hopeless.|source=—The three main groups (core, wavering, and hostile) are metaphorically described as tomatoes, apples, and grapes, respectively.&lt;ref name=H-LH/&gt;|align=right|width=300px}}
There are three main classifications and about 50 sub-classifications. According to [[Kim Il-sung]], who spoke in 1958, the loyal "core class" constituted 25% of the North Korean population, the "wavering class" constituted 55%, and the "hostile class" constituted 20%.&lt;ref name=HRNKSongbun&gt;{{cite book|title=Marked for Life: Songbun, North Korea’s Social Classification System|publisher=Committee for Human Rights in North Korea|url=http://hrnk.org/wp-content/uploads/HRNK_Songbun_FINALFINAL.pdf|author=Robert Collins|accessdate=June 8, 2012|date=June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with a landlord, merchant, lawyer, or Christian minister in their background are given very low status.&lt;ref name=BRHLH&gt;{{cite web|title=A Look at North Korean Society|url=http://www.winzigconsultingservices.com/files/samples/kq/Helen_Hunter.html|publisher=winzigconsultingservices.com|accessdate=June 8, 2011|author=Jerry Winzig|format=book review of ''Kim Il-song's North Korea'' by Helen-Louise Hunter|quote=In North Korea, one's songbun, or socio-economic and class background, is extremely important and is primarily determined at birth.  People with the best songbun are descendants of the anti-Japanese guerrillas who fought with Kim Il-song, followed by people whose parents or grandparents were factory workers, laborers, or poor, small farmers in 1950.  "Ranked below them in descending order are forty-seven distinct groups in what must be the most class-differentiated society in the world today."  Anyone with a father, uncle, or grandfather who owned land or was a doctor, Christian minister, merchant, or lawyer has low songbun.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest status is accorded to those descended from participants in the resistance against Japanese occupation during and before World War II and to those who were factory workers, laborers or peasants as of 1950. [[Brian Reynolds Myers|B. R. Myers]], associate professor of international studies at [[Dongseo University]] in [[Busan]], South Korea, summarizes the core class as consisting of "high-ranking party cadres and their families". The wavering class is reserved for average North Koreans, whereas the "hostile" class is made of possible subversive elements (e.g. former landowners).&lt;ref name="BR Myers"/&gt;  According to [[CIA]] analyst Helen-Louise Hunter, the Communists were highly successful in turning the pre-revolutionary social structure upside down, and songbun is reflective of that. In her view, the "preferred class" consists of 30% of the population, the "ordinary people" make up the middle 40%, and "undesirables" make up the bottom 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Helen-Louise Hunter, ''Kim Il-song's North Korea'', Praeger, Westport, Connecticut, 1999, pp 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Files are maintained on every North Korean by security official and party cadres&lt;ref name=H-LH/&gt; from age 17 and updated every two years.&lt;ref name=HRNKSongbun /&gt; In general, songbun is difficult to improve, but it can be downgraded for a variety of reasons such as a lack of political enthusiasm, marrying someone of lower standing, or being convicted – or having a family member convicted – of a crime, political or otherwise.&lt;ref name=H-LH/&gt; Before the late 1960s, it was possible to conceal that a relative had bad songbun; however, the ancestry of all citizens was thoroughly checked starting with a 1966 census.&lt;ref name=H-LH/&gt; These investigations have been suggested to have been a response to the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]] which began in 1966. Kim Il-sung, afraid that Beijing would also interfere in his country, whether by invading or sponsoring a coup d'état (Chinese soldiers had been sent previously on "provocative incursions" into Korea), aimed to increase internal security by classifying his citizens.&lt;ref name="BR Myers"&gt;{{cite book|author=B.R. Myers|title=The Cleanest Race: How North Koreans See Themselves and Why It Matters|location=Hoboken, NJ|publisher=Melville House Publishing|year=2010|ISBN=978-1-933633-91-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These investigations were repeated several times in subsequent years, for reasons varying from suspected corruption in previous checks to weeding out possible opposition.&lt;ref name=H-LH/&gt;

U.S. journalist [[Barbara Demick]] describes this "class structure" as an updating of the hereditary "[[caste system]]", combining [[Confucianism]] and [[Stalinism]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Demick, ''Nothing to Envy: Love, Life and Death in North Korea,'' Fourth Estate, London, 2010, pp 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  She claims that a bad family background is called "tainted blood", and that by law this "tainted blood" lasts for three generations.&lt;ref&gt;Demick, pp 28, 197, 202.&lt;/ref&gt; She asserts, however, that North Koreans are not told of their classification, and that children can grow up without knowing about their family status.&lt;ref&gt;Demick, p 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, analyst Helen-Louise Hunter describes songbun as "class background" and says that it is not officially published or precisely defined.&lt;ref&gt;Helen-Louise Hunter, ''Kim Il-song's North Korea'', Praeger, Westport, Connecticut, 1999, pp 3, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[North Korean government]], on the contrary, proclaims that all citizens are equal and denies any discrimination on the basis of family background.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kinu.or.kr/eng/pub/pub_04_01.jsp?bid=DATA04&amp;page=1&amp;num=32&amp;mode=view KINU White Paper on Human Rights in North Korea 2011, p. 216, 225]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==

Under Kim Jong-il, things are different—your family background still matters, but money nowadays is more important than social background.|source=—Description of songbun by a North Korean refugee born in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name="Lankov2011"/&gt;|align=left|width=300px}}
Since the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] in the late 1980s to early 1990s, the importance of songbun has decreased. Before the collapse, the North Korean economy was heavily subsidized by the bloc. Through these funds, the government was able to provide all material goods, so income could only be derived by working in industry or the bureaucracy. As a result, one's ability to obtain goods from the distribution system, where one could live, what career was pursued, or how much one could advance in society depended solely on their songbun, which made it the "single-most important factor that determined the life of a North Korean". Before the centralized system's collapse—which led to [[North Korean famine|famine]]—the government had "near-complete control of an individual's life"; ergo, the only way to increase one's status or affluence was by advancing through the bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="Lankov2011"/&gt;

During the 1994 to 1998 [[North Korean famine]] itself — when up to 2.5 million died — the songbun system "often determined who ate and who starved", according to Brian Hook.&lt;ref name="HOOK-nyt-2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=HOOK|first1=BRIAN H.|title=The Parasites Feeding on North Koreans|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/24/opinion/north-korea-songbun.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=opinion-c-col-right-region&amp;region=opinion-c-col-right-region&amp;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-right-region|accessdate=25 November 2017|agency=New York Times|date=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the centralized system collapsed, the importance of songbun decreased. To survive, capitalism was "rediscovered", and the average North Korean now derives most of his or her income through private enterprise. When these private markets started, it was instead more advantageous to be part of the hostile class, because they were not as dependent on the government as were those with better songbun. Military service has decreased in popularity; previously, after seven to ten years of service, a North Korean man could hope to become a low-level bureaucrat, but nowadays it is more profitable to engage in private enterprise. Songbun remains important to members of the government elite, but for the majority of North Koreans, wealth has become more important than songbun when defining one's place in society.&lt;ref name="Lankov2011" /&gt;

A prominent example of songbun involves [[Ko Yong-hui]], the mother of present leader [[Kim Jong-un]]. Ko was born in [[Osaka]], Japan, which would make her part of the hostile class because of her Korean-Japanese heritage; furthermore, her grandfather worked in a sewing factory for the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].&lt;ref name="DNK0626"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00400&amp;num=9418 |title=Happy Birthday, Ko Young Hee |publisher=[[Daily NK]] |accessdate=2012-07-01 |date=2012-06-26 |author=Ko Young-ki |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012015947/http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00400&amp;num=9418 |archivedate=2013-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Before an internal propaganda film was released, after the ascension of Kim Jong-un, there were three attempts made to idolize Ko, in a style similar to that associated with [[Kang Pan-sŏk]], mother of Kim Il-sung, and [[Kim Jong-suk]], mother of [[Kim Jong-il]] and the first wife of Kim Il-sung.&lt;ref name="DNK0630"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailynk.com/english/read.php?num=9441&amp;cataId=nk00100 |title="Great Mother" revealed to World |publisher=[[Daily NK]] |accessdate=2012-07-01 |date=2012-06-30 |author=Cho Jong-ik |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924042103/http://dailynk.com/english/read.php?num=9441&amp;cataId=nk00100 |archivedate=2014-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These previous attempts at idolization had failed, and they were stopped after Kim Jong-il's 2008 stroke.&lt;ref name="DNK0626"/&gt; 
The building of a cult of personality around Ko encounters the problem of her bad songbun, as making her identity public would undermine the Kim dynasty's pure bloodline.&lt;ref name="DNK0626"/&gt; Ko's real name or other personal details have not been publicly revealed (her origins could be figured out, as she worked with [[Mansudae Art Troupe]] in Pyongyang), so she is referred to as "Mother of Korea" or "Great Mother", and the most recent propaganda film called its main character "Lee Eun-mi". The complications of Ko's songbun were such that after Kim Jong-il's death, her personal information, including name, became state secrets.&lt;ref name="DNK0630"/&gt; While songbun is usually passed from the father,&lt;ref name="Lankov2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/ML03Dg01.html|title=North Korea's new class system|author=[[Andrei Lankov]]|publisher=[[Asia Times]]|date=2011-12-03|accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ko's background has the "lowest imaginable status qualities" for a North Korean.&lt;ref name="DNK0626"/&gt;

Art by [[Oscar Jimenez (comics)|Oscar Jimenez]].]]

A '''speedster''' is a character whose powers primarily relate to '''superhuman speed'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (also known as '''superspeed'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA; 'Superspeed (fiction)' redirects here--&gt;). Primary abilities shared by all speedsters include running at speeds far in excess of human capability (to varying degrees) and resistance to the side effects (air resistance, inability to breathe, dynamic shock resulting from contact with objects at high speed, etc.) that result from such velocity. In almost all cases, speedsters are able to physically attack opponents by striking them while at high speed to impart huge amounts of kinetic energy without suffering harm, although this has on rare occasion been [[wikt:lampshade#Verb|lampshaded]] by characters discovering that they cannot do this and suffering severe injury from the attempt. A variety of other powers have been attributed to speedsters depending on the story, the origin of the power, and the established continuity and rules of a given universe.

==Plausibility and artistic license==
The use of speedsters in fiction requires [[artistic license]] due to the laws of [[physics]] that would prohibit such abilities.  Moving at the speed of sound, for example, would create [[sonic boom]]s that are usually not heard in such stories.  An enormous amount of energy would be required to achieve such speeds, and as some speedsters can actually move close to or at the [[speed of light]], this would cause them to gain near-infinite mass, according to the laws of [[theory of relativity|relativity]].

For example, the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' states that the character [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] maintains speeds which can be considered "modest," especially when carrying a passenger. The Handbook also concedes that a solid object moving in the Earth’s atmosphere at several times the speed of sound or faster would wreak havoc on the planet and that moving at such speeds would prohibit Northstar from breathing, while the generated wind/friction would ravage his body. On the other hand, the Handbook states that the character [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] was born with adaptations that make higher speeds possible, such as enhanced [[cardiovascular]], [[respiratory]], [[musculature]], and [[Digestion|digestive]] systems, a more efficient [[metabolism]] (which has been a weakness for some incarnations of [[The Flash (2014 TV series)|the Flash]], calling themselves "[[Justice League (film)|snack holes]]"), better lubricated joints, [[tendon]]s with the [[tensile strength]] of spring steel, unidentified bone composition that can withstand the dynamic shock of his touching the ground at speeds over 100 miles an hour, and a brain that can process information fast enough for him to react to his surroundings at high speed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'', by Mark Gruenwald and Peter Sanderson; Volume Five; Pages 55 &amp; 128.&lt;!-- Bibliographic information here is needed. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In comics published by [[DC Comics]], the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] family of speedsters derive their abilities from an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|extradimensional]] energy source known as the [[Speed Force (DC Comics)|Speed Force]], which grants them superspeed and various other abilities required to use it, such as durability.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbr.com/speed-force-facts/&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Speed Force is not the source from which other DC characters with superspeed such as [[Superman]] or [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel/Shazam]] derive their powers.

Writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] maintained modest abilities for the speedster character Danny Hilltop in his series ''[[John Byrne’s Next Men]]''.  Although Danny can keep pace with a race car, the friction generated by his speed melts any footwear he wears, burning his feet.  Thus he runs barefoot, having toughened the soles of his feet through a regimen of pounding increasingly harder materials (sand, gravel and then broken rock).&lt;ref&gt;John Byrne’s Next Men #7; September 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  The costume he wears has a built-in guidance system.

Other writers choose not to offer any scientific explanations for the questions raised by the actual use of such abilities.

Comic book writer [[Peter David]], whose run on the series ''[[Young Justice]]'' included the junior speedster [[Impulse (DC Comics)|Impulse]], has opined that speedsters are inherently difficult to write, saying:
{{cquote|Speedsters make me nervous, because if you play them accurately, they're impossible to beat...The moment someone sees him coming, it's too late.  You shout, "It's the Flash!" and you haven't even got "It's" out before you're done&lt;ref&gt;[http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/000870.html Question and answer with Peter David]&lt;/ref&gt;...I could deal with Impulse because he was easily distracted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/000943.html Further discussion with Peter David]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Some speedsters may also end up destroying their surroundings or entire astronomical structures around them by their sheer speed alone if they are not careful enough. For example, [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Saitama|Saitama]] from ''[[One-Punch Man]]'' accidentally destroyed a large portion of the Moon when he jumped back to Earth from it within ten seconds during his battle with [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Boros|Boros]].

==In other media==
[[File:Tachyon1.jpg|thumb|A [[webcomic]] speedster character.]]Speedsters in other media include [[Daphne Millbrook]] (played by Brea Grant), a character in the [[NBC]] television [[superhero]] drama ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]''. Daphne first appeared in that series' third season in 2008, initially as a [[supervillain|villain]].&lt;ref&gt;The character is referred to as a "speedster" on Page 3 of the August 25, 2008 ''[[TV Guide]]'', and refers to herself as such in "[[The Second Coming (Heroes)|The Second Coming]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many characters exist in other media such as [[film]], [[video games]], [[anime]] and [[manga]] who possess the abilities to perform feats at incredible speeds that exceed the abilities of those around them.  Examples include the video game character [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], and the animated cartoon characters [[Speedy Gonzales]], the [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner|Road Runner]], Morton of ''[[Horton Hears A Who! (film)|Horton Hears A Who!]]'', several [[Ben 10]] Aliens including [[List of Ben 10 aliens#XLR8|XLR8]], [[List of Ben 10 aliens#Jetray|Jetray]], and [[List of Ben 10 aliens#Fasttrack|Fasttrack]], [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Rainbow Dash|Rainbow Dash]] (and in one case, Pinkie Pie taking on an alter ego called 'Filisecond' in a comic book universe) from ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'', [[Saitama (One Punch Man)|Saitama]], [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Speed o' Sound Sonic|Speed o' Sound Sonic]], [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Flashy Flash|Flashy Flash]] and several other characters of ''[[One-Punch Man]]'', several Stand users and almost all other characters from ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'', [[Goku]], [[Vegeta]], [[Frieza]], [[Beerus]], [[Whis]], [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Jiren|Jiren]] and practically every single character in the entire ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' franchise and [[Dashiell Robert Parr|Dash Parr]] of ''[[The Incredibles]]''. [[Lab Rats (U.S. TV series)#Cast and characters|Bree Davenport]], the superhero from ''[[Lab Rats (U.S. TV series)|Lab Rats]]'' is the one the characters depend on to take them to mission sights.

[[File:TheTwoCultures.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Oxford University Press|OUP]])]]
'''''The Two Cultures''''' is the first part of an influential 1959 [[Rede Lecture]] by [[United Kingdom|British]] scientist and novelist [[C. P. Snow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Snow| first= Charles Percy | title = The Two Cultures |year=2001 | origyear = 1959 |publisher=Cambridge University Press| location= London | isbn = 978-0-521-45730-9 | page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = TLS /&gt; Its thesis was that "the intellectual life of the whole of western society" was split into the titular two cultures – namely the [[science]]s and the [[humanities]] – and that this was a major hindrance to solving the world's problems.

'''''The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution''''' (1959) was a published version of the lectures in book form. 

==The lecture==
The talk was delivered 7 May 1959 in the [[Senate House (University of Cambridge)|Senate House]], Cambridge, and subsequently published as ''The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution''. The lecture and book expanded upon an article by Snow published in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' of 6 October 1956, also entitled ''The Two Cultures''.{{Sfn | Snow | 2013}}  Published in book form, Snow's lecture was widely read and discussed on both sides of the Atlantic, leading him to write a 1963 follow-up, ''The Two Cultures: And a Second Look: An Expanded Version of The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Two Cultures: And a Second Look: An Expanded Version of The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution |last=Snow |first=Charles Percy |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow's position can be summed up by an often-repeated part of the essay:
{{Quote |A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standards of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]]. The response was cold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is the scientific equivalent of: ''Have you read a work of [[Shakespeare]]'s?''&lt;ref name= Nature&gt;{{cite journal |title=Across the Great Divide |journal=Nature Physics |year=2009 |volume=5 |issue=5 |page=309 |url = http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v5/n5/full/nphys1258.html |doi= 10.1038/nphys1258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I now believe that if I had asked an even simpler question – such as, What do you mean by [[mass]], or [[acceleration]], which is the scientific equivalent of saying, ''Can you read?'' – not more than one in ten of the highly educated would have felt that I was speaking the same language. So the great edifice of modern [[physics]] goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the [[western world]] have about as much insight into it as their [[neolithic]] ancestors would have had.&lt;ref name=Nature /&gt;}}

In 2008, ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' included ''The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution'' in its list of the 100 books that most influenced Western public discourse since the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name = TLS&gt;{{cite news| url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article5418361.ece | location = London | work= The Times | title= The hundred most influential books since the war | date=30 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow's Rede Lecture condemned the [[British education]]al system as having, since the [[Victorian era]], over-rewarded the humanities (especially [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]) at the expense of scientific and [[engineering]] education, despite such achievements having been so decisive in winning the [[Second World War]] for the Allies.&lt;ref name=Jardine&gt;{{cite journal | title = CP Snow's Two Cultures Revisited | last = Jardine | first = Lisa | authorlink = Lisa Jardine | journal = Christ's College Magazine | year = 2010 | pages = 48–57 | format = PDF | url = http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/cms_misc/media/Publications_Christs_Magazine_2010_web.pdf | accessdate = 2012-02-13 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120417151018/http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/cms_misc/media/Publications_Christs_Magazine_2010_web.pdf | archivedate = 17 April 2012 | df = dmy-all }} Jardine's 2009 C. P. Snow Lecture honored the 50th anniversary of Snow's Rede Lecture. She places Snow's lecture into its historical context, and emphasizes the expansion of certain elements of the Rede Lecture in Snow's Godkin Lectures at Harvard University in 1960. These were ultimately published as {{cite book |title = Science and Government |publisher=New American Library |year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in practice deprived British [[elite]]s (in politics, administration, and industry) of adequate preparation to manage the modern scientific world. By contrast, Snow said, [[German education|German]] and [[American schools]] sought to prepare their citizens equally in the sciences and humanities, and better scientific teaching enabled these countries' rulers to compete more effectively in a scientific age. Later discussion of ''The Two Cultures'' tended to obscure Snow's initial focus on differences between British systems (of both schooling and [[social class]]) and those of competing countries.&lt;ref name=Jardine /&gt;

== Implications and influence ==
The literary critic [[F. R. Leavis]] called Snow a "public relations man" for the scientific establishment in his essay ''Two Cultures?: The Significance of C. P. Snow'', published in ''[[The Spectator]]''.  The article attracted a great deal of negative correspondence in the magazine's letters pages.&lt;ref name=kimball&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kimball |first=Roger |url = http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/-The-Two-Cultures--today-4882 |title=The Two Cultures' today: On the C. P. Snow–F. R. Leavis controversy | journal=[[The New Criterion]] |date=12 February 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1963 book Snow appeared to revise his thinking and was more optimistic about the potential of a mediating third culture.  This concept was later picked up in {{Citation | year = 1995 | title = The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution | author-link = John Brockman (literary agent)| first = John | last = Brockman| title-link = The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution }}. Introducing the reprinted {{Citation | title = The Two Cultures | year = 1993}}, [[Stefan Collini]]{{Sfn | Collini | 1993 | p = lv}} has argued that the passage of time has done much to reduce the cultural divide Snow noticed, but has not removed it entirely.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s ''[[The Hedgehog, the Fox, and the Magister's Pox]]'' provides a different perspective. Assuming the [[dialectical]] interpretation, it argues that Snow's concept of "two cultures" is not only off the mark, it is a damaging and short-sighted viewpoint, and that it has perhaps led to decades of unnecessary fence-building.

[[Simon Critchley]], in ''Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction'' suggests:{{Sfn | Critchley | 2001 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=syhsLJ1eMOEC&amp;pg=PA49  49]}}
{{Quote |[Snow] diagnosed the loss of a common culture and the emergence of two distinct cultures: those represented by scientists on the one hand and those Snow termed 'literary intellectuals' on the other. If the former are in favour of social reform and progress through science, technology and industry, then intellectuals are what Snow terms 'natural [[Luddites]]' in their understanding of and sympathy for advanced industrial society. In [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]]'s terms, the division is between [[Jeremy Bentham|Benthamites]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridgeans]].|Simon Critchley}}

That is, Critchley argues that what Snow said represents a resurfacing of a discussion current in the mid-nineteenth century. Critchley describes the Leavis contribution to the making of a controversy as "a vicious ''ad hominem'' attack"; going on to describe the debate as "a familiar clash in English cultural history" citing also [[T. H. Huxley]] and [[Matthew Arnold]].{{Sfn | Critchley | 2001 | p = 51}}{{Sfn | Collini | 1993 | p = xxxv}}

In his opening address at the [[Munich Security Conference]] in January 2014, the Estonian president [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] said that the current problems related to security and freedom in cyberspace are the culmination of absence of dialogue between "the two cultures": "Today, bereft of understanding of fundamental issues and writings in the development of liberal democracy, computer geeks devise ever better ways to track people... simply because they can and it's cool. Humanists on the other hand do not understand the underlying technology and are convinced, for example, that tracking meta-data means the government reads their emails."&lt;ref&gt;Ilves, Toomas Hendrik: "[http://www.president.ee/en/official-duties/speeches/9796-qrebooting-trust-freedom-vs-security-in-cyberspaceq/index.html Rebooting Trust?

Contrasting scientific and humanistic knowledge is a repetition of the ''[[Methodenstreit]]'' of 1890 German universities.&lt;ref name="Brint2002p212"&gt;{{Citation | last = Brint | first = Steven G | year = 2002 | title = The Future of the City of Intellect: The Changing American University | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TDfrzER0obYC&amp;pg=PA212 | pages = 212–3 | quote = positivism-versus-interpretation language [...] these fractal distinctions are generally quite old. Most of them have been around at least since the celebrated ''Methodenstreit'' of the German universities in the late nineteenth century. CP Snow's "two cultures" argument captures a later instantiation of them. [...] In negotiating the complexities of social scientific and humanistic knowledge, it is extremely helpful to have a dichotomy like positivism versus interpretation, because it saves our having to remember the exact degree of positivism of any scholarly group. [...] Every single social science discipline has internal debates about positivism/interpretation, narrative/analysis, and so on. The narrative/analytic debate may look very different in economics, anthropology, and English. But underneath all the surface differences it is quite similar.| isbn = 9780804745314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A quarrel in 1911 between [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Giovanni Gentile]] on the one hand and [[Federigo Enriques]] on the other one [https://books.google.it/books?id=oXjMYIonXTYC&amp;pg=PA422&amp;lpg=PA422&amp;dq=1911+croce+gentile+enriques+fight&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y-I3OzBiJi&amp;sig=KYsoohR9-x53CW8pBXJbYflTqGU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjzrcu80JDeAhWKk4sKHUdaCgEQ6AEwD3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false is believed] to have had enduring effects in the separation of the two cultures in Italy and to the predominance of the views of (objective) idealism over those of (logical) positivism.

"'''The captain goes down with the ship'''" is an [[idiom]] and maritime tradition that a [[sea captain]] holds ultimate responsibility for both his ship and everyone embarked on it, and that in an emergency, he will either save them or die trying. Although often connected to the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the RMS ''Titanic'']] in 1912 and its captain, [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward J. Smith]], the phrase precedes ''Titanic'' by at least 11 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=John |first=Alix |title=The Night-hawk: A Romance of the '60s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DrUXAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22captain%20goes%20down%20with%20his%20ship%22&amp;pg=PA249#v=onepage&amp;q=%22captain%20goes%20down%20with%20his%20ship%22&amp;f=false |date=1901 |publisher=Frederick A. Stokes |location=New York |pages=249 |quote=...for, if anything goes wrong a woman may be saved where a captain goes down with his ship.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most instances, the captain of the ship forgoes his own rapid departure of a ship in distress, and concentrates instead on saving other people. It often results in either the death or belated rescue of the captain as the last person on board.

==History==
The concept is closely related to another protocol from the nineteenth century, "[[women and children first]]." Both reflect the Victorian ideal of [[chivalry]] in which the upper classes were expected to emulate a morality tied to sacred honour, service, and respect for the disadvantaged. The actions of the captain and men during the sinking of {{HMS|Birkenhead|1845|6}} in 1852 prompted praise from many due to the sacrifice of the men who saved the women and children by evacuating them first. [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem "Soldier an' Sailor Too" and [[Samuel Smiles]]' ''[[Self-Help (book)|Self-Help]]'' both highlighted the valour of the men who stood at attention and played in the band as their ship was sinking.

==Social and legal responsibility==
The idiom literally means that a captain will be the last person to leave a ship alive before its sinking or utter destruction, and if unable to evacuate the crew and passengers, the captain will not save himself even if he can.&lt;ref name=bbc2012&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16611371 |title=Must a captain be the  one off a sinking ship? |work=[[BBC News]] |date=18 January 2012 |accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a social context, especially as a [[mariner]], the captain will feel compelled to take this responsibility as a type of [[Norm (social)|social norm]]. Shirking this responsibility in a crisis would go against societal [[mores]] because of the offender's lack of [[ethics]].

In [[maritime law]], the ship's master's responsibility for his vessel is paramount no matter what its condition, so abandoning a ship has legal consequences, including the nature of [[salvage rights]]. So even if a captain abandons his ship in distress, he is generally responsible for it in his absence and would be compelled to return to the ship until danger to the vessel has relented. If a naval captain evacuates a vessel in wartime, it may be considered a [[capital offence]] similar to desertion unless he subsequently returns to the ship at his first opportunity to prevent its capture and rescue the crew.

Abandoning a ship in distress may be considered a crime that can lead to imprisonment.&lt;ref name=bbc2012 /&gt; Captain [[Francesco Schettino]], who left his ship in the midst of the [[Costa Concordia disaster|''Costa Concordia'' disaster]], was not only widely reviled for his actions, but lost his final appeal against his 16-year Italian prison sentence including one year for abandoning his passengers, five years for causing the shipwreck, and ten years for manslaughter of its victims. Abandoning ship is a maritime crime that has been on the books for centuries in Spain, Greece and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/17/travel/cruise-ship-passenger-safety/index.html?_s=PM:TRAVEL |title=In a cruise ship crisis, what should happen? |first=Katia |last=Hetter |work=CNN |date=19 January 2012 |accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Korean law may also require the captain to rescue himself last.&lt;ref name=drewmouawad&gt;{{cite news |title=Breaking Proud Tradition, Captains Flee and Let Others Go Down With Ship |first1=Christopher |last1=Drew |first2=Jad |last2=Mouawad |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 19, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/world/asia/in-sad-twist-on-proud-tradition-captains-let-others-go-down-with-ship.html?_r=0 |accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Finland the Maritime Law (''Merilaki'') states that the captain must do everything in his power to save everyone on board the ship in distress and that unless his life is in immediate danger, he shall not leave the vessel as long as there is reasonable hope that it can be saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1994/19940674 |title=Merilaki 6 Luku 12 §. 15.7.1994/674 - Ajantasainen lainsäädäntö |work=FINLEX, database of Finnish Acts and Decrees |year=2015 |accessdate=6 June 2015 |language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, abandoning the ship is not explicitly illegal, but the captain could be charged with other crimes, such as [[manslaughter]], which encompass [[common law]] precedent passed down through centuries. It is not illegal under international maritime law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Longstreth |first=Andrew |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/20/us-italy-ship-maritimelaw-idUSTRE80J1R020120120 |title=Cowardice at sea is no crime&amp;nbsp;– at least in the U.S. |publisher=Reuters |date= |accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*May 30, 1918: When the Italian [[Steamship|steamer]] ''Pietro Maroncelli'' was torpedoed by the German submarine [[SM UB-49|''UB 49'']] and started to sink, Italian Rear Admiral Giovanni Viglione, who was on board as the convoy commodore, ordered all the survivors into the lifeboats, then chose to stay aboard and to go down with the ship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/4800.html Steamer Pietro Maroncelli - Uboat.net]&lt;/ref&gt;
*November 1, 1918: In the last days of [[Adriatic Campaign of World War I|World War I]], [[Croat]]ian [[Rear admiral]] [[Janko Vuković]], the first day he was appointed fleet commander, chose to go down with his [[flagship]] {{SMS|Viribus Unitis}} in [[Pula]] harbor as [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] frogmen sank it with two 200-kg mines.
*November 23, 1939. [[HMS Rawalpindi|HMS ''Rawalpindi'']], a British armed merchant cruiser (a converted passenger ship) encountered  the German battleships ''[[German battleship Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]]'' and ''[[German battleship Gneisenau|Gneisenau]]'' north of the [[Faroe Islands]]. Her captain, [[Edward Coverley Kennedy]], despite being hopelessly outgunned, ordered an attack. He went down with his ship.
*June 27, 1940. When [[Italian submarine Console Generale Liuzzi|Italian submarine ''Console Generale Liuzzi'']] was forced to surface by British destroyers in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Lorenzo Bezzi, ordered his crew to abandon ship and then scuttled the submarine, going down with it.
*October 21, 1940. During the [[Attack on convoy BN 7|Battle of Harmil Island]], Italian destroyer ''Francesco Nullo'' was fatally damaged by [[HMS Kimberley (F50)|HMS ''Kimberley'']]. Her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander [[Costantino Borsini]], chose to go down with his ship; seaman Vincenzo Ciaravolo, his attendant, chose to follow him.
*November 5, 1940. German pocket battleship ''[[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|Admiral Scheer]]'' encountered Allied [[Convoy HX 84]] in the North Atlantic. The convoy consisted of 38 merchant ships escorted by [[HMS Jervis Bay|HMS ''Jervis Bay'']], an ocean liner newly armed with guns of 1890s design. Her captain, [[Edward Fegen]] [[Victoria Cross|VC]], signalled the convoy to scatter, and attacked the enemy. ''Jervis Bay'' was hopelessly outranged and outgunned, and was sunk; her captain and many of her crew went down with her. The sacrifice bought enough time for 31 of the convoy to make it to safety.
*May 24, 1941: During the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]], [[HMS Hood|HMS ''Hood'']] suffered a direct hit and magazine explosion, which sank the ship in three minutes. Only three people survived the disaster. One of the survivors, [[Ted Briggs]], said in interviews after the sinking that [[Lancelot Holland|Admiral Holland]] was last seen sitting in his chair, making no attempt to escape from the sinking ship. 
*May 27, 1941: Captain [[Ernst Lindemann]] of the [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] was said to be with his combat messenger, a leading seaman, and apparently trying to persuade his messenger to save himself. In this account, his messenger took Lindemann's hand and the two walked to the forward flagmast. As the ship turned over, the two stood briefly to attention, then Lindemann and his messenger saluted. As the ship rolled to port, the messenger fell into the water. Lindemann continued his salute while clinging to the flagmast, going down with the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Grützner 2010, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGowen 1999, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;
*December 10, 1941: Admiral Sir [[Tom Phillips (Royal Navy officer)|Tom Phillips]] and Captain [[John Leach (Royal Navy officer)|John Leach]] both went down with the [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|Prince of Wales]] during [[sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|its sinking along with the Repulse]] by Japanese warplanes off the coast of [[Pahang]], [[British Malaya]].
*February 28, 1942: [[Schout-bij-nacht|Rear Admiral]] [[Karel Doorman]] was killed in action when his flagship {{HNLMS|De Ruyter|1935|6}} was torpedoed in the [[Battle of the Java Sea]]. Part of the crew was rescued before the sinking, but the Dutch admiral chose to go down with the ship. Captain Lieutenant [[Eugène Lacomblé]] also died in the sinking.
*June 5, 1942: Rear Admiral [[Tamon Yamaguchi]], on board the aircraft carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryu|''Hiryu'']], insisted on staying with the stricken ship during the [[Battle of Midway]]. The ship's commander, Captain Kaku, followed his example.  In addition, Captain [[Ryusaku Yanagimoto]] chose to remain with his ship [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sōryū|''Sōryū'']] when it was scuttled after being destroyed in the same battle.
*February 7, 1943: Commander [[Howard W. Gilmore]], captain of the American submarine {{USS|Growler|SS-215|6}}, gave the order to "clear the bridge," as his crew was being attacked by a Japanese gunboat. Two men had been shot dead; Gilmore and two others were wounded. After all others had entered the sub and Gilmore found that time was critically short, he gave his [[last words|last order]]: "Take her down." The executive officer, hearing his order, closed the hatch and submerged the crippled boat, saving the rest of the crew from the attack of the Japanese convoy escort. Commander Gilmore, who was never seen again, received the [[Medal of Honor]] posthumously for his "distinguished gallantry," making him the second submariner to receive this award.
*November 19,1943: Captain [[John P. Cromwell]] went down on the sinking sub [[USS Sculpin (SS-191)|USS ''Sculpin'']].
*October 24, 1944: Admiral Inoguchi Toshihira&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ww2db.com/person_bio.php?person_id=308 |title=Toshihira Inoguchi |work=World War II Database |year=2015 |accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; chose to go down with the [[Japanese battleship Musashi|Japanese battleship ''Musashi'']], during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], even though he could have escaped.  Over half of the ship's crew, 1376 of 2399, were rescued.
*April 7, 1945: Admiral [[Seiichi Ito]], the fleet admiral, and Captain [[Kosaku Aruga]] went down with the [[Japanese battleship Yamato|Japanese battleship ''Yamato'']] during [[Operation Ten-Go]].
* December 30, 1950: [[Luis González de Ubieta]] (born 1899), [[exile]]d Admiral of the [[Spanish Republican Navy]], went down with his ship.

At least 194 members of the crew died in the sinking, which reportedly took two minutes.
*October 29, 2012: Captain Robin Walbridge of the ''[[Bounty (1960 ship)|Bounty]]'', a replica of {{HMS|Bounty}}, stayed on the ship until it [[capsized]] during [[Hurricane Sandy]].

*October 2, 2015:  Captain Michael Davidson, master of the cargo ship [[SS El Faro|El Faro]] was recorded on the Voyage Data Recorder encouraging the ship's helmsman, frozen by fear and exhaustion, to join him in abandoning the vessel, before the recording ended with both still on the bridge of the sinking ship.

==Counter-examples==
In some cases the captain may choose to [[Scuttling|scuttle]] the ship and escape danger rather than die as it sinks. This choice is usually only available if the damage does not immediately imperil a vast portion of the ship's company and occupants. If a [[distress call]] was successful and the crew and occupants, the ship's cargo, and other items of interest are rescued, then the vessel may not be worth anything as [[marine salvage]] and allowed to sink. In other cases a military organization or [[navy]] might wish to destroy a ship to prevent it being taken as a [[prize (law)|prize]] or captured for [[espionage]], such as occurred in the {{USS|Pueblo|AGER-2|6}} incident. Commodities and war [[material]] carried as [[cargo]] might also need to be destroyed to prevent capture by the opposing side.

In other cases a captain may decide to save himself to the detriment of his crew, the vessel, or its mission. A decision that shirks the responsibilities of the command of a vessel will usually bring upon the captain a legal, criminal, or social penalty, with military commanders often facing dishonor.

*July 17, 1880: The captain and crew of the {{SS|Jeddah}} abandoned the ship and their passengers in a storm expecting it would sink, but the ship was found with all passengers alive two weeks later. A key part of [[Joseph Conrad]]'s 1899-1900 novel ''[[Lord Jim]]'' is based on this incident; Conrad had been a captain in the merchant marine before turning to writing.
*August 4, 1906: Captain Giuseppe Piccone abandoned the {{SS|Sirio}} at the first opportunity. Between 150 and 400 people died when the ship sank.
*July 30 1945: The {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}} was torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese submarine. Captain [[Charles B. McVay III]] managed to survive in shark-infested waters for three days before the survivors were discovered, and later became the only captain in the history of the U.S. Navy to face court-martial for his ship being sunk by enemy action. He committed suicide on November 6, 1968, and was cleared of wrongdoing by the Secretary of the Navy in 2001.
*November 12, 1965: When a fire broke out aboard the {{SS|Yarmouth Castle}}, Captain Byron Voustinas was on the first lifeboat, which had only crew and no passengers aboard. 90 people died.
*April 7, 1990: Having been erroneously informed the ship was evacuated, Captain Hugo Larsen abandoned the {{MS|Scandinavian Star}} after arson caused the ship to burn. 158 people died.
*August 3–4, 1991: Captain [[Yiannis Avranas]] of the cruise ship [[MTS Oceanos|MTS ''Oceanos'']] abandoned ship without informing passengers that the ship was sinking. All passengers survived. A Greek board of inquiry found Avranas and four officers negligent in their handling of the disaster.
*January 13, 2012: Captain [[Francesco Schettino]] abandoned ship during the [[Costa Concordia disaster|''Costa Concordia'' disaster]]. 32 people died in the accident. Schettino was sentenced to 16 years in prison for his role in the disaster. 
*April 16, 2014: Captain Lee Joon-seok abandoned the South Korean ferry [[Sinking of the MV Sewol|MV ''Sewol'']]. The captain and much of the crew were saved, while hundreds of students from [[Danwon High School]] embarked for their trip remained in their cabins, according to instructions provided by the crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=참사 2주째 승무원도 제대로 파악 안돼 |trans-title=Exact Number of Crew still not known 2 weeks after the ferry disaster |url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/634984.html |accessdate=3 May 2014 |newspaper=[[The Hankyoreh]] |date=20 April 2014 |language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=drewmouawad/&gt; Many passengers apparently remained on the sinking vessel and died. Following this incident, the captain was arrested and put on trial beginning in early June 2014, when video footage filmed by some survivors and news broadcasters showed him being rescued by a coast guard vessel. Orders to abandon ship never came, and the vessel sank with all [[life raft]]s still in their stowage position. The captain was subsequently sentenced to 36 years in prison for his role in the deaths of the passengers, and was also given a life sentence, after being found guilty of murder of the 304 passengers that did not survive.
*June 1, 2015: The Chinese captain of the river cruise ship ''[[Dong Fang Zhi Xing]]'' left the ship before most passengers were rescued. On June 13, 442 deaths were confirmed with 12 rescued among 454 on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yangtze River Ship Captain Faces Questions on Sinking |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=June 2, 2015 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/yangtze-river-ferry-captain-faces-questions-on-sinking-1433237962}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the deadliest peacetime maritime disaster in China's history.{{Cn|date=May 2018}}

==Extended or metaphorical use==
When used metaphorically, the "captain" may be simply the leader of a group of people, "the ship" may refer to some other place that is threatened by catastrophe, and "going down" with it may refer to a situation that implies a severe penalty or death. It is common for references to be made in the case of the military and when leadership during the situation is clear. So when a raging fire threatens to destroy a mine, the mine's supervisor, the "captain," may perish in the fire trying to rescue his workers trapped inside, and acquaintances might say that he went down with his ship or that he "died trying."

===In aviation===
[[Image:561016PanAmDitches-5.jpg|thumb|right|Pan Am Flight 6 successfully ditches in the Pacific Ocean with Captain Ogg on the second of two life rafts. The airplane sank a few minutes after this photo was taken.]]
The concept has been explicitly extended in law to the [[pilot in command]] of an aircraft, in the form of laws stating that he "[has] final authority and responsibility for the operation and safety of the flight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div8&amp;node=14:1.0.1.1.1.0.1.1 |title=Title 14  Chapter I  Subchapter A  Part 1  §1.1 |work=[[Code of Federal Regulations]] |year=2015 |accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jurisprudence]] has explicitly interpreted this by analogy with the captain of a sea vessel.

This is particularly relevant when an aircraft is forced to ditch in the ocean and becomes a floating vessel that will almost certainly sink. For example, following the crash of [[US Airways Flight 1549]] into the [[Hudson River]], pilot [[Chesley Sullenberger]] was the last person to exit the partially-submerged aircraft, and performed a final check for any others on board before doing so.

Similarly, on October 16, 1956, [[Pan Am Flight 6]] was a [[Boeing 377 Stratocruiser]] en route from Honolulu to San Francisco that was forced to ditch in the Pacific Ocean due to multiple engine failures. The airliner broke apart when one of its wings collided with a wave swell. Airline Captain Richard N. Ogg was the last to exit the airplane during the successful mid-ocean ditching and rescue of all 31 on board by the US Coast Guard Cutter [[USCGC Pontchartrain (WHEC-70)|USCGC ''Pontchartrain'']]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thisdayinaviation.com/16-october-1956/ This Day in Aviation, 16 October 1956], 2016, Bryan R. Swopes&lt;/ref&gt; The airplane fuselage sank with no one on board a few minutes later.

===In academia===
After a major scandal at [[Baylor University]], the university fired President [[Kenneth Starr]] and appointed him chancellor. A week later, Starr resigned as chancellor and "willingly accepted responsibility" for the actions of Baylor that "clearly fell short." He stated that his resignation for the scandal was "a matter of conscience," and said, "The captain goes down with the ship."&lt;ref name=espn&gt;http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/15875833/kenneth-starr-resign-chancellor-baylor-continue-teach&lt;/ref&gt; He indicated that his resignation was necessary even though he "didn't know what was happening."

The '''theta model''', or '''Ermentrout–Kopell [[canonical form|canonical]] model''', is a [[biological neuron model]] originally developed to model neurons in the animal [[Aplysia]], and later used in various fields of [[computational neuroscience]].  The model is particularly well suited to describe neuron [[bursting]], which are rapid oscillations in the [[membrane potential]] of a neuron interrupted by periods of relatively little oscillation.  Bursts are often found in [[neurons]] responsible for controlling and maintaining steady rhythms.  For example, breathing is controlled by a small network of bursting neurons in the brain stem.   Of the three main classes of bursting [[neurons]] ([[Bursting#Square-wave burster|square wave bursting]], [[parabolic bursting]], and [[elliptic bursting]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee |title=Stability Analysis Of Bursting Models |journal=Journal of the Korean Mathematical Society |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=827–45 |year=2005 |doi=10.4134/jkms.2005.42.4.827}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vries G.

[[Parabolic bursting]] is characterized by a series of bursts that are regulated by a slower external oscillation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B, Kopell, N |title=Parabolic bursting in an [[excitable system]] coupled with a slow oscillation |journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics | volume=46 |pages=233–253 |year=1986 |doi=10.1137/0146017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This slow oscillation changes the frequency of the faster oscillation so that the frequency curve of the burst pattern resembles a parabola.

The model has just one [[state variable]] which describes the membrane voltage of a neuron. In contrast, the [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]] consists of four state variables (one voltage variable and three gating variables) and the  [[Morris–Lecar model]] is defined by two state variables (one voltage variable and one gating variable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Ermentrout B, Terman DH |title=Mathematical Foundations of Neuroscience |publisher=Springer |location=New York |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-387-87707-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The single [[state variable]] of the theta model, and the elegantly simple [[equations]] that govern its behavior allow for [[analytical expression|analytic]], or [[Closed-form expression|closed-form]] solutions (including an explicit expression for the [[phase response curve]]).  The [[dynamical system|dynamics]] of the model take place on the [[unit circle]], and are governed by two [[cosine]] functions and a real-valued input [[function (mathematics)|function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B, Kopell, N |title=Parabolic bursting in an excitable system coupled with a slow oscillation |journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics | volume=46 |pages=233–253 |year=1986 |doi=10.1137/0146017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bursting is "an oscillation in which an observable [part] of the system, such as [[voltage]] or [[chemical concentration]], changes periodically between an active phase of rapid [[action potential|spike]] oscillations (the fast sub-system) and a phase of quiescence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bertram, R., M.

All three forms of bursting are capable of beating and periodic bursting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Plant, R. Kim, M. |title=Mathematical Description of a Bursting Pacemaker Neuron by a Modification of the Hodgkin–Huxley Equations |journal=Biophysical Journal | volume=16 | issue=3 |pages=227–44 |year=1976 |doi=10.1016/s0006-3495(76)85683-4 |pmid=1252578 |pmc=1334834}}&lt;/ref&gt; Periodic bursting (or just bursting) is of more interest because many phenomena are controlled by, or arise from, bursting.  For example, bursting due to a changing [[membrane potential]] is common in various neurons, including but not limited to [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] chattering neurons, [[thalamacortical]] neurons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Izhikevich, E.M. |title=Bursting |journal=Scholarpedia | volume=1 | issue=3 |pages=1300 |year=2006 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1300}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[pacemaker neurons]].  Pacemakers in general are known to burst and [[synchronize]] as a population, thus generating a robust rhythm that can maintain repetitive tasks like breathing, walking, and eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Marder, E. |author2=R.

Since many biological processes involve bursting behavior, there is a wealth of various bursting models in scientific literature.  For instance, there exist several models for [[interneurons]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Erisir, A., D. Lau, B. Rudy, and S. Leonard |title=Function of Specific K+ Channels in Sustained High-frequency Firing of Fast-spiking Neocortical Cells |journal=J. Neurophysiol. | volume=82 |pages=2476–489 |year=1999 |doi=10.1152/jn.1999.82.5.2476}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] [[spiking neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Izhikevich, E.M. |title=Which Model to Use for Cortical Spiking Neurons? |journal=IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks | volume=15| issue=5 |pages=1063–070 |year=2004 |doi=10.1109/tnn.2004.832719}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the literature on parabolic bursting models is relatively scarce.

Parabolic bursting models are [[mathematical models]] that mimic parabolic bursting in real biological systems.  Each [[bursting|burst]] of a [[parabolic burster]] has a characteristic feature in the burst structure itself – the frequency at the beginning and end of the burst is low relative to the frequency in the middle of the burst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee |title=Stability Analysis Of Bursting Models |journal=Journal of the Korean Mathematical Society |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=827–45 |year=2005 |doi=10.4134/jkms.2005.42.4.827}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[frequency]] plot of one burst resembles a [[parabola]], hence the name "parabolic burst".  Furthermore, unlike elliptic or square-wave bursting, there is a slow modulating wave which, at its peak, excites the cell enough to generate a burst and inhibits the cell in regions near its minimum.  As a result, the neuron periodically transitions between bursting and quiescence.

Parabolic bursting has been studied most extensively in the R15 neuron, which is one of six types of neurons of the ''Aplysia'' abdominal ganglion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Faber D, Klee M |title=Membrane Characteristics of Bursting Pacemaker Neurons in Aplysia |journal=Nature New Biology |volume=240 |pages=29–31 |year=1972 |doi=10.1038/newbio240029a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of thirty neurons comprising the [[abdominal ganglion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kandel, E.

Early attempts to model parabolic bursting were for specific applications, often related to studies of the R15 neuron.  This is especially true of R. E.

Though there was no specific mention of the term "parabolic bursting" in Plant's papers, [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Plant_model Plant's model(s)] do involve a slow, modulating oscillation which control bursting in the model(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Plant, R. Kim, M. |title=Mathematical Description of a Bursting Pacemaker Neuron by a Modification of the Hodgkin–Huxley Equations |journal=Biophysical Journal | volume=16 | issue=3 |pages=227–44 |year=1976 |doi=10.1016/s0006-3495(76)85683-4 |pmid=1252578 |pmc=1334834}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Plant, R. |title=The Effects of Calcium++ on Bursting Neurons.

Both of Plant's papers on the topic involve a model derived from the [[Hodgkin–Huxley equations]] and include extra conductances, which only add to the complexity of the model.

Carpenter developed her model primarily for a square wave burster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carpenter, Gail A. |title=Bursting Phenomena in Excitable Membranes |journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics | volume=36 | issue=2 |pages=334–372 |year=1979 |doi=10.1137/0136027}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The model was capable of producing a small variety of square wave bursts and produced parabolic bursts as a consequence of adding an extra [[Electrical conductance|conductance]].  However, the model applied to only spatial propagation down [[axons]] and not situations where oscillations are limited to a small region in space (i.e. it was not suited for "space-clamped" situations).

The lack of a simple, generalizable, space-clamped, parabolic bursting model motivated Ermentrout and Kopell to develop the theta model.

==Characteristics of the model==

===General equations===
It is possible to describe a multitude of parabolic bursting cells by deriving a simple mathematical model, called a canonical model.  Derivation of the Ermentrout and Kopell canonical model begins with the general form for parabolic bursting, and notation will be fixed to clarify the discussion.  The letters &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are reserved for functions; &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; for state variables; &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; for [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalars]].

In the following generalized system of equations for parabolic bursting, the values of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; describe the membrane potential and ion channels, typical of many [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Conductance-based_models conductance-based] biological neuron models.  Slow oscillations are controlled by &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, and ultimately described by &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.  These slow oscillations can be, for example, slow fluctuations in calcium concentration inside a cell.  The function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; couples &lt;math&gt;\dot{y}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt;, thereby allowing  the second system, &lt;math&gt;\dot{y}&lt;/math&gt;, to influence the behavior of the first system, &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt;.  In more succinct terms, "&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; generates the spikes and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; generates the slow waves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B, Kopell, N |title=Parabolic bursting in an excitable system coupled with a slow oscillation |journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics | volume=46 |pages=233–253 |year=1986 |doi=10.1137/0146017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The equations are:

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{x} = f(x) + \varepsilon^2 g(x,y,\varepsilon),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{y} = \varepsilon h(x,y,\varepsilon),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a vector with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; entries (i.e. &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}^p&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is a vector with &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; entries (i.e. &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathbb{R}^q&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is small and positive, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; are [[Smooth function|smooth]] (i.e. infinitely differentiable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B, Kopell, N |title=Parabolic bursting in an excitable system coupled with a slow oscillation |journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics | volume=46 |pages=233–253 |year=1986 |doi=10.1137/0146017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional constraints are required to guarantee parabolic bursting.  First, &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; must produce a circle in [[phase space]] that is [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]], meaning it does not change under certain [[Transformation (function)|transformations]].  This circle must also be [[Attractor|attracting]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; with a [[Critical point (mathematics)|critical point]] located at &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  The second criterion requires that when &lt;math&gt;\dot{y}=h(0,y,0)&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a stable [[limit cycle]] solution.  These criteria can be summarized by the following points:

#When &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; "has an attracting invariant circle with a single critical point", with the critical point located at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, and
#When &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\dot{y}=h(0,y,0)&lt;/math&gt; has a stable limit cycle solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B, Kopell, N |title=Parabolic bursting in an excitable system coupled with a slow oscillation |journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics | volume=46 |pages=233–253 |year=1986 |doi=10.1137/0146017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theta model can be used in place of any parabolic bursting model that satisfies the assumptions above.

=== Model equations and properties ===

The theta model is a reduction of the generalized system from the previous section and takes the form,

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\theta}{dt}=1-\cos\theta+(1+\cos\theta)I(t), \qquad \theta \in S^1.&lt;/math&gt;

This model is one of the simplest excitable neuron models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McKennoch, S., Voegtlin T., and Bushnell L. |title=Spike-Timing Error Backpropagation in Theta Neuron Networks |journal=Neural Computation | volume=21 | issue=1 |pages=9–45| doi=10.1162/neco.2009.09-07-610 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The state variable &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; represents the angle in [[radian]]s, and the input function, &lt;math&gt;I(t)&lt;/math&gt;, is typically chosen to be [[Periodic function|periodic]].  Whenever &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; reaches the value &lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi&lt;/math&gt;, the model is said to produce a spike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B. |title=Ermentrout–Kopell Canonical Model |journal=Scholarpedia | volume=3 | issue=3 |pages=1398 |year=2008 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McKennoch, S., Voegtlin T., and Bushnell L. |title=Spike-Timing Error Backpropagation in Theta Neuron Networks |journal=Neural Computation | volume=21 | issue=1 |pages=9–45| doi=10.1162/neco.2009.09-07-610 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theta model is capable of a single [[Saddle-node bifurcation|saddle-node]] [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] and can be shown to be the "[[Normal form (mathematics)|normal form]] for the saddle-node on a limit cycle bifurcation" ([http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Saddle-node_bifurcation_on_invariant_circle SNIC]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B. |title=Ermentrout-Kopell Canonical Model |journal=Scholarpedia | volume=3 | issue=3 |pages=1398 |year=2008 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1398}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When &lt;math&gt;(I &lt; 0)&lt;/math&gt;, the system is excitable, i.e., given an appriate [[Perturbation (biology)|perturbation]] the system will produce a spike. Incidentally, when viewed in the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;), the [[unstable]] critical point is actually a [[saddle point]] because &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; is attracting in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;.  When &lt;math&gt;(I &gt; 0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is also positive, and the system will give rise to a limit cycle.   Therefore, the bifurcation point is located at &lt;math&gt;I(t) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Near the bifurcation point, the theta model resembles the [[quadratic integrate and fire]] model:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2 + I.&lt;/math&gt;

For I &gt; 0, the solutions "blow up" rather quickly.  By resetting the trajectory &lt;math&gt;x(t) &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; when it reaches &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the total period is then

: &lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{I}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the period diverges as &lt;math&gt;I \rightarrow 0^+&lt;/math&gt; and the frequency converges to zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B. |title=Ermentrout–Kopell Canonical Model |journal=Scholarpedia | volume=3 | issue=3 |pages=1398 |year=2008 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Example====
When &lt;math&gt;I(t)&lt;/math&gt; is some slow wave which can be both negative and positive, the system is capable of producing parabolic bursts.  Consider the simple example &lt;math&gt;I(t) := \sin(\alpha t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is relatively small.  Then for &lt;math&gt;\alpha t \in (0, \pi)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I(t)&lt;/math&gt; is strictly positive and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; makes multiple passes through the angle &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, resulting in multiple bursts.   Note that whenever &lt;math&gt;\alpha t&lt;/math&gt; is near zero or &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, the theta neuron will spike at relatively a low frequency, and whenever &lt;math&gt;\alpha t&lt;/math&gt; is near &lt;math&gt;\alpha t = \pi/2&lt;/math&gt; the neuron will spike with very high frequency. When &lt;math&gt;\alpha t = \pi&lt;/math&gt;, the frequency of spikes is zero since the period is infinite since &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; can no longer pass through &lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, for &lt;math&gt;\alpha t \in (\pi, 2\pi)&lt;/math&gt;, the neuron is excitable and will no longer burst.  This qualitative description highlights the characteristics that make the theta model a parabolic bursting model.  Not only does the model have periods of quiescence between bursts which are modulated by a slow wave, but the frequency of spikes at the beginning and end of each burst is high relative to the frequency at the middle of the burst.

===Derivation===
The derivation comes in the form of two [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemmas]] in Ermentrout and Kopell (1986).  Lemma 1, in summary, states that when viewing the general equations above in a subset &lt;math&gt;S^1 \times \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, the equations take the form:

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{x_1} = \overline{f}(x_1) + \varepsilon^2 \overline{g}(x_1, y, \varepsilon) \qquad x_1 \in S^1,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{y} = \varepsilon \overline{h}(x_1, y, \varepsilon) \;\;\;\;\;\; y \in \mathbb{R}^q.&lt;/math&gt;

By lemma 2 in Ermentrout and Kopell 1986, "There exists a change of coordinates... and a constant, c, such that in new coordinates, the two equations above [[Pointwise convergence|converge pointwise]] as &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; to the equations

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = (1-\cos\theta) + (1 + \cos\theta)\overline{g}(0,y,0),&lt;/math&gt;
 
: &lt;math&gt;\dot{y} = \frac{1}{c} \overline{h}(0,y,0),&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;\theta \neq \pi&lt;/math&gt;.  Convergence is [[Uniform convergence|uniform]] except near &lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi&lt;/math&gt;." (Ermentrout and Kopell, 1986).  By letting &lt;math&gt;I(t) := \overline{g}(0,y,0)&lt;/math&gt;, resemblance to the theta model is obvious.

===Phase response curve===
[[File:theta-prc.png|right|thumb|250px|The phase response curve of the theta model with K = 1. Since perturbations always result in a phase advance, this is a type 1 PRC.]]

In general, given a scalar phase model of the form

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = f(\theta) + g(\theta)S(t),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S(t)&lt;/math&gt; represents the perturbation current, a closed form solution of the [[phase response curve]] (PRC) does not exist.

However, the theta model is a special case of such an oscillator and happens to have a closed-form solution for the PRC.  The theta model is recovered by defining &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; as

: &lt;math&gt;f(\theta) = (1-\cos\theta) + I(1+\cos\theta),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;g(\theta) = (1 + \cos\theta).&lt;/math&gt;

In the appendix of Ermentrout 1996, the PRC is shown to be &lt;math&gt;Z(\theta) = K(1+\cos\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout, B. |title=Type I Membranes, Phase Resetting Curves, and Synchrony |journal=Neural Computation | volume=8 | issue=5 |pages=979–1001| year=1996 | doi=10.1162/neco.1996.8.5.979 | pmid=8697231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar models==

===Plant's model===
The authors of Soto-Treviño et al. (1996) discuss in great detail the similarities between Plant's (1976) model and the theta model.  At first glance, the mechanisms of bursting in both systems are very different:  In Plant's model, there are two slow oscillations – one for conductance of a specific current and one for the concentration of calcium.  The calcium oscillations are active only when the membrane potential is capable of oscillating.  This contrasts heavily against the theta model in which one slow wave modulates the burst of the neuron and the slow wave has no dependence upon the bursts.  Despite these differences, the theta model is shown to be similar to Plant's (1976) model by a series of coordinate transformations. In the process, Soto-Trevino, et al. discovered that the theta model was more general than originally believed.

===Quadratic integrate-and-fire===

The quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) model was created by Latham et al. in 2000 to explore the many questions related to networks of neurons with low firing rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Latham, P. E., B. J. Richmond, P. G. Nelson, and S. Nirenberg. |title=Intrinsic Dynamics in Neuronal Networks. I. Theory. |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology | volume=88 | issue=2 |pages=808–27 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unclear to Latham et al. why networks of neurons with "standard" parameters were unable to generate sustained low frequency firing rates, while networks with low firing rates were often seen in biological systems.

According to Gerstner and Kistler (2002), the [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Quadratic_integrate_and_fire_neuron quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) model] is given by the following differential equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\tau \dot{u} = a_0(u-u_\text{rest})(u-u_c) + R_m I,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; is a strictly positive scalar, &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the membrane potential, &lt;math&gt;u_\text{rest}&lt;/math&gt; is the resting potential &lt;math&gt;u_c&lt;/math&gt; is the minimum potential necessary for the membrane to produce an action potential, &lt;math&gt;R_m&lt;/math&gt; is the membrane resistance, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; the membrane time constant and &lt;math&gt;u_c &gt; u_\text{rest}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Spiking Neuron Models. Single Neurons, Populations, Plasticity |author1=W. Gerstner  |author2=W. Kistler  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When there is no input current (i.e. &lt;math&gt;I = 0&lt;/math&gt;), the membrane potential quickly returns to rest following a perturbation.  When the input current, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, is large enough, the membrane potential (&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;) surpasses its firing threshold and rises rapidly (indeed, it reaches arbitrarily large values in finite time); this represents the peak of the action potential.  To simulate the recovery after the action potential, the membrane voltage is then reset to a lower value &lt;math&gt;u_r&lt;/math&gt;.  To avoid dealing with arbitrarily large values in simulation, researchers will often set an upper limit on the membrane potential, above which the membrane potential will be reset; for example Latham et al. (2000) reset the voltage from +20&amp;nbsp;mV to −80&amp;nbsp;mV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Latham, P. E., B. J. Richmond, P. G. Nelson, and S. Nirenberg. |title=Intrinsic Dynamics in Neuronal Networks. I. Theory. |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology | volume=88 | issue=2 |pages=808–27 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This voltage reset constitutes an action potential.

The theta model is very similar to the QIF model since the theta model differs from the QIF model by means of a simple coordinate transform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brunel, Nicolas, Latham |title=Firing Rate of the Noisy Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire Neuron |journal=Neural Computation | volume=15 | issue=10 |pages=2281–306 |year=2003 |doi=10.1162/089976603322362365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Latham, P. E., B. J. Richmond, P. G. Nelson, and S. Nirenberg. |title=Intrinsic Dynamics in Neuronal Networks. I. Theory. |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology | volume=88 | issue=2 |pages=808–27 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By scaling the voltage appropriately and letting &lt;math&gt;\Delta I&lt;/math&gt; be the change in current from the minimum current required to elicit a spike, the QIF model can be rewritten in the form

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{u} = u^2 + \Delta I.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the theta model can be rewritten as

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = 1-\cos\theta +  (1+\cos\theta) \Delta I.&lt;/math&gt;

The following proof will show that the QIF model becomes the theta model given an appropriate choice for the coordinate transform.

Define &lt;math&gt;u(t) = \tan(\theta/2)&lt;/math&gt;.  Recall that &lt;math&gt;d\tan(x)/dx = 1/\cos^2(x)&lt;/math&gt;, so taking the derivative yields

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{u} = \frac 1 {\cos^2\left(\frac \theta 2\right)} \frac 1 2 \dot{\theta} = u^2 + \Delta I.&lt;/math&gt;

An additional substitution and rearranging in terms of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; yields

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = 2\left[ \cos^2\left(\frac\theta2\right)\tan^2 \left(\frac\theta2\right) + \cos^2\left(\frac\theta2\right)\Delta I \right] = 2\left[ \sin^2 \left(\frac \theta 2\right) + \cos^2 \left ( \frac \theta 2\right)\Delta I \right].&lt;/math&gt;

Using the trigonometric identities &lt;math&gt;\cos^2(x/2) = \frac{1+\cos(x)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sin^2(x/2) = \frac{1-\cos(x)}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; as defined above, we have that

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = 2 \left[ \frac{1-\cos\theta} 2 + \left(\frac{1+\cos\theta}{2}\right) \Delta I \right] = 1-\cos\theta + (1+\cos\theta)\Delta I.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, there exists a change of coordinates, namely &lt;math&gt;u(t) = \tan(\theta/2)&lt;/math&gt;, which transforms the QIF model into the theta model.  The reverse transformation also exists, and is attained by taking the inverse of the first transformation.

====Lobster stomatogastric ganglion====
Though the theta model was originally used to model slow cytoplasmic oscillations that modulate fast membrane oscillations in a single cell, Ermentrout and Kopell found that the theta model could be applied just as easily to systems of two electrically coupled cells such that the slow oscillations of one cell modulates the bursts of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B, Kopell, N |title=Parabolic bursting in an excitable system coupled with a slow oscillation |journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics | volume=46 |pages=233–253 |year=1986 |doi=10.1137/0146017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such cells serve as the central pattern generator (CPG) of the [[Pylorus|pyloric]] system in the lobster stomatograstic ganglion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Marder, E.  |author2=Eisen,  J.

Their computational results showed that this may happen due to strong stimulation of a large group of inhibitory neurons. This effect not only inhibits neighboring populations, but has the extra consequence of leaving the inhibitory neurons in disarray, thus increasing the effectiveness of inhibition.

===Theta networks===
Osan et al. (2002) found that in a network of theta neurons, there exist two different types of waves that propagate smoothly over the network, given a sufficiently large coupling strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Osan R. |author2=Rubin J. |author3=Ermentrout B.  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Regular Traveling Waves in a One-Dimensional Network of Theta Neurons |journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics | volume=62 | issue=4 |pages=1197–1221 |year=2002 |doi=10.1137/s0036139901387253|citeseerx=10.1.1.83.2413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such traveling waves are of interest because they are frequently observed in pharmacologically treated brain slices, but are hard to measure in intact animals brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Osan R. |author2=Rubin J. |author3=Ermentrout B.  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Regular Traveling Waves in a One-Dimensional Network of Theta Neurons |journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics | volume=62 | issue=4 |pages=1197–1221 |year=2002 |doi=10.1137/s0036139901387253|citeseerx=10.1.1.83.2413 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors used a network of theta models in favor of a network of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) models due to two primary advantages: first, the theta model is continuous, and second, the theta model retains information about "the delay between the crossing of the spiking threshold and the actual firing of an action potential".  The LIF fails to satisfy both conditions.

===Artificial intelligence===

====Steepest gradient descent learning rule====
The theta model can also be applied to research beyond the realm of biology. McKennoch et al. (2008) derived a steepest [[gradient descent]] [[Association rule learning|learning rule]] based on theta neuron dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McKennoch, S., Voegtlin T., and Bushnell L. |title=Spike-Timing Error Backpropagation in Theta Neuron Networks |journal=Neural Computation | volume=21 | issue=1 |pages=9–45| doi=10.1162/neco.2009.09-07-610 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their model is based on the assumption that "intrinsic neuron dynamics are sufficient to achieve consistent time coding, with no need to involve the precise shape of postsynaptic currents..."  contrary to similar models like SpikeProp and [[Tempotron]], which depend heavily on the shape of the [[postsynaptic potential]] (PSP).  Not only could the multilayer theta network perform just about as well as Tempotron learning, but the rule trained the multilayer theta network to perform certain tasks neither SpikeProp nor Tempotron were capable of.

==Limitations==
According to Kopell and Ermentrout (2004), a limitation of the theta lies in its relative difficulty in electrically coupling two theta neurons.  It is possible to create large networks of theta neurons – and much research has been done with such networks – but it may be advantageous to use Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neurons, which allow for electrical coupling in a "straightforward way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kopell N.  |author2=Ermentrout B.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Chemical and Electrical Synapses Perform Complementary Roles in the Synchronization of Interneuronal Networks |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=101 |issue=43 |pages=15482–5487 |year=2004 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0406343101 |pmid=15489269 |pmc=524455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tranquillity''' (also spelled '''tranquility'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/tranquility&amp;r=67 Answers.com], retrieved on 12-16-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;) is the quality or state of being tranquil; that is, calm, serene, and worry-free. The word tranquillity appears in numerous texts ranging from the religious writings of Buddhism, where the term ''[[passaddhi]]'' refers to tranquillity of the body, thoughts and consciousness on the path to enlightenment, to an assortment of policy and planning guidance documents, where interpretation of the word is typically linked to engagement with the [[natural environment]].

==Benefits==
[[psychology|Psychological]] being in a tranquil or ‘restorative’ environment allows individuals to take respite from the periods of sustained ‘directed attention’ that characterise modern living. In developing their [[Attention Restoration Theory]] (ART), Kaplan and Kaplan&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan R. and Kaplan, S. (1989). The Experience of Nature. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that recovery from cognitive overload could most effectively be achieved by engaging with natural restorative environments, that are away from daily distractions and have the extent and mystery that allows the imagination to wander, thereby enabling individuals to engage effortlessly with their surroundings. The theory works on the principle that the amount of reflection possible within such an environment depends upon the type of cognitive engagement, i.e. fascination; that the environment holds. ‘Soft fascination’ is deemed to occur when there is enough interest in the surroundings to hold attention but not so much that it compromises the ability to reflect. In essence, soft fascination, which has been taken by Herzog&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, T. R. and Bosley, P. J. (1992). Tranquillity and preference as affective qualities of natural environments. Journal of Environmental Psychology 12, 115-127.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pheasant&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Pheasant, Mark N. Fisher, Greg R. Watts, David J. Whitaker and Kirill V. Horoshenkov. (2010). The importance of auditory-visual interaction in the construction of tranquil space. Journal of Environmental Psychology 30, 501 -509.&lt;/ref&gt; as a reasonable term to describe tranquillity, provides a pleasing level of sensory input that involves no cognitive effort other than removing oneself from an overcrowded mental space.

===Enjoyment===
For many, the chance to experience tranquillity is what makes the countryside different from cities. In a survey by the [[United Kingdom Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (DEFRA) 58% of people said that tranquillity was the most positive feature of the countryside.

===Health===
In contrast to ‘soft fascination’, ‘directed attention’ requires a significant amount of cognitive effort and it is known that prolonged periods of sustained mental activity can lead to directed attention fatigue. This condition has the potential to significantly affect performance and bring about negative emotions, irritability and decreased sensitivity to interpersonal cues.&lt;ref&gt;Hartig, T., Kaiser, F. G. &amp; Bowler, P. A. (1997). Further development of a measure of perceived environmental restorativeness. Working paper 5, Institute for Housing Research, Uppsala University, Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt; As the incidence of mental illness continues to rise,&lt;ref&gt;Berglund, B., Lindvall, T and Schwela, D. H. (1999). World Health Organisation guidelines for community noise.&lt;/ref&gt; there is growing evidence that exposure to natural environments can make a significant contribution to health and [[wellbeing]]. Mounting evidence shows, that exposure to nature contributes to physical and psychological wellbeing, such as the review carried out by Louv,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Louv. (2008). Last Child in the Woods: Saving our Children from Nature Deficit Disorder. Algonquin Press&lt;/ref&gt; that found evidence of ‘nature-deficit-disorder’ in children, which suggests that the importance of being able to engage with restorative environments applies across a wide age range. 
Others report that natural tranquil surroundings have profound physiological effects on people suffering from [[Stress (biology)|stress]]. For example, Ullrich&lt;ref&gt;R. S. Ulrich, F. Simons, B. D. Losito, E. Fiorito, M. A. Miles and M. Zelson. (1991). Stress recovery during exposure to natural and urban environments. Journal of Environmental Psychology 11, 201-230.&lt;/ref&gt; found that stress (as measured by blood pressure, muscle tension and skin conductance response), induced by showing videos of workplace injuries, improved significantly quicker following further viewing if videos included natural surroundings rather than busy traffic or shopping scenes. A recent study has demonstrated the benefits of simulating such environments for pain relief during bone marrow aspirate and biopsy.&lt;ref&gt;biopsyLechtzin N, Busse A M, Smith M T, Grossman S, Nesbit S, Diette G B. (2010).  Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine 16(9), 965–972.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
Since seeking tranquillity is an important reason why many people visit the countryside, the presence of tranquil areas helps boost rural tourism. Since rural tourism in the UK directly supports 380,000 jobs and £13.8 billion annually to the economy, and a recent survey showed that tranquillity is the main reason why 49% of visitors go are attracted to the countryside, one can conclude that tranquillity is worth 186,200 jobs and £6.76 billion a year to the economy.{{Ref|rural}}

==Tranquillity research==
Natural settings that effortlessly engage our attention are typically associated with soft fascination and with the analysis of tranquillity and preference published by Herzog and Bosely (1992). In this study, the authors attempted to distinguish empirically between the constructs of tranquillity and preference as affective qualities of natural environments. Motivated by ART, from which they took tranquillity as a reasonable term to describe soft fascination, they produced definitions for each component. Tranquillity they defined as "how much you think this setting is a quiet, peaceful place, a good place to get away from everyday life", and preference as "how much you like this setting for whatever reason".
Subjects were asked to score the following visual settings: mountains, deserts, fields / forests and waterscapes against the two target variables, tranquillity and preference, and four descriptor variables: mistiness, unstructured openness, focus and surface calmness. Tranquillity and preference were positively correlated across all settings with tranquillity scoring higher ratings in the field / forest, waterscape and mountain categories, whilst rushing water had the highest rating in the preference category.
Analysis of the results identified three physical features that help explain the apparent split between tranquillity and preference. These were; mistiness, unstructured openness; which refers to how open the scene is and how difficult it is to establish a sense of depth or distance, and surface calmness. Mistiness and unstructured openness tended to depress preference relative to tranquillity whilst surface calmness tended to enhance it. Herzog and Barnes&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, T. R. &amp; Barnes, G. J. (1999). Tranquillity and preference revisited. Journal of Environmental Psychology 19, 171-18.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a follow up study in which deserts and waterscapes were included in the setting types. In 2000, Herzog and Chernick&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, T. R. and Chernick, K. K. (2000). Tranquility and Danger in Urban and Natural Settings. Journal of Environmental Psychology, 20, 29-39.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted further research into the tranquillity construct when they investigated the relationship between tranquillity and danger in urban and rural settings.
The key results that emerged from this research were that ‘setting care’, which relates to how safe we feel in a particular setting, is more salient for judgments of danger in urban settings than natural ones and that openness was a significant predictor of danger but not of tranquillity. The authors concluded therefore that tranquillity and danger should not simply be viewed as polar opposites, but like preference and tranquillity as distinct constructs.

===The role of audio-visual interaction within the tranquillity construct===

Within tranquillity studies, much of the emphasis has been placed on understanding the role of vision in the [[perception]] of natural environments, which is probably not surprising, considering that upon first viewing a scene its configurational coherence can be established with incredible speed. Indeed, scene information can be captured in a single glance&lt;ref&gt;Oliva, A. &amp; Torralba, A. (2006). Building the gist of a scene: The role of global image features and recognition. Progress in Brain Research 155 (2), 23 – 36.&lt;/ref&gt; and the gist of a scene determined in as little as 100ms.&lt;ref&gt;Dobel, C. &amp; Gumnoir, H. (2006). Describing scenes hardly seen. Acta Psychologica 125, 129 – 143.&lt;/ref&gt; The speed of processing of complex natural images was tested by Thorpe ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, S., Fize, D. &amp; Marlot, C. (1996). Speed of processing in the human visual system. Nature 381, 520 – 522.&lt;/ref&gt; using colour photographs of a wide range of animals (mammals, birds, reptiles and fish), in their natural environments, mixed with distracters that included pictures of forests, mountains, lakes, buildings and fruit. During this experiment, subjects were shown an image for 20ms and asked to determine whether it contained an animal or not. The electrophysiological brain responses obtained in this study showed that a decision could be made within 150ms of the image being seen, indicating the speed at which cognitive visual processing occurs.
However, audition, and in particular the individual components that collectively comprise the [[soundscape]], a term coined by Schafer&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, R. M. (1977). The Soundscape: Our sonic environment and the tuning of the world. Destiny Books Rochester, Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the ever-present array of sounds that constitute the sonic environment, also significantly inform the various schemata used to characterise differing landscape types. This interpretation is supported by the auditory reaction times, which are 50 to 60ms faster than that of the visual modality.&lt;ref&gt;Jaśkowski, P., Jaroszyk, F., &amp; Hojan-Jezierska, D. (1990). Temporal-order judgement and reaction time for stimuli of different modalities. Psychol Research  52, 35-38.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known that sound can alter visual perception&lt;ref&gt;Shams, L., Kanutani, S. &amp; Shimojo, S. (2002). Visual illusion induced by sound. Journal of Cognitive Brain Research 14, 147 – 152.&lt;/ref&gt; and that under certain conditions areas of the brain involved in processing auditory information can be activated in response to visual stimuli. 
Research conducted by Pheasant ''et al.'' has shown that when individuals make tranquillity assessments based on a uni-modal auditory or visual sensory input, they characterise the environment by drawing upon a number of key landscape and soundscape characteristics. For example, when making assessments in response to visual-only stimuli the percentage of water, flora and geological features present within a scene, positively influence how tranquil a location is perceived to be. Likewise when responding to uni-modal auditory stimuli, the perceived loudness of biological sounds positively influences the perception of tranquillity, whilst the perceived loudness of mechanical sounds have a negative effect. However, when presented with bi-modal auditory-visual stimuli the individual soundscape and landscape components alone no longer influenced the perception of tranquillity. Rather configurational coherence was provided by the percentage of natural and contextual features present within the scene and the equivalent continuous sound pressure level (LAeq).

===Predicting tranquillity===

Researchers at the Bradford Centre for Sustainable Environments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainable-environments.brad.ac.uk/|title=Please wait while you are being redirected|website=www.sustainable-environments.brad.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; have developed a methodology by which the perceived tranquillity rating (TR) of an amenity area such as park, green or urban square can be measured, on a 0 - 10 scale.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J Pheasant, Kirill V Horoshenkov and Greg R Watts. Tranquillity Rating prediction tool (TRAPT). Institute of Acoustics – Acoustics Bulletin, 35 (6), November/December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Pheasant., K. V. Horoshenkov., G. R. Watts and B. T. Barrett. (2008). The acoustic and visual factors influencing the construction of tranquil space in urban and rural environments: Tranquil Spaces - Quiet places? J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 123(3), 1446-1457.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Pheasant., G. R. Watts. and K. V. Horoshenkov. (2009). Validation of a tranquillity rating prediction tool, J. ACTA Acustica United with Acustica. 95(6), 1024-1031.&lt;/ref&gt; The method involves the assessment of average daytime noise levels Lday (usually traffic noise) and the measurement of the percentage of natural and contextual features NCF contained within the visual scene. The latter includes the percentage area in the visual scene occupied by natural features in the landscape such as vegetation, water and geological features, e.g. exposed rock outcrops, and contextual features. These contextual elements include listed buildings, religious and historic buildings, landmarks, monuments and elements of the landscape, such as traditional farm buildings, that directly contribute to the visual context of the natural environment. Lastly, the equation includes moderating factors (MF) that can influence the perception of tranquillity in either a positive, or a negative way. 
	
TR = 9.68 + 0.041 NCF – 0.146 Lday + MF 		

These moderating factors are not expected to be large and because they are relatively difficult to quantify they are the subject of ongoing research. One potentially effective solution to improving tranquillity, is to mask traffic noise or distract attention with an attractive water sound. A previous experiment has demonstrated that water generated sounds have the potential to improve the perceived tranquillity of gardens blighted by noise.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Watts, R. J. Pheasant, K. V. Horoshenkov and L. Ragonesi. (2009). Measurement and subjective assessment of water generated sounds. Acta Acustica united with Acustica, 95, 1032-1039.&lt;/ref&gt;  A further study has demonstrated that litter has the potential to degrade an environment such that the tranquillity rating drops on average by one scale point.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Watts, R. J. Pheasant and K. V. Horoshenkov. Validation of tranquillity rating method, Proceedings of the Institute of Acoustics &amp; Belgium Acoustical Society, Noise in the Built Environment, Ghent, 29–30 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

This bi-modal relationship is supported by work recently carried out by SCANLab at the University of Sheffield, using [[fMRI]] neuro-imaging techniques.&lt;ref&gt;M.D.Hunter., S. B. Eickhoff., R. J. Pheasant., M. J. Douglas., G. R. Watts., T. F. D. Farrow., D. Hyland., J. Kang., I. D. Wilkinson., K. V. Horoshenkov and P. W. R. Woodruff. (2010). The state of tranquillity: Subjective perception is shaped by contextual modulation of auditory connectivity. NeuroImage 53(2), 611 – 18.&lt;/ref&gt; This study demonstrated for the first time the significant differences in effective connectivity between areas of the brain, namely the auditory cortex and the medial [[pre-frontal cortex]], under tranquil and non-tranquil conditions. Specifically the medial pre-frontal cortex receives significantly enhanced contributions from the [[auditory cortex]] when presented with a tranquil visual scene compared with non-tranquil visual stimuli.

===Mapping tranquillity===
[[Image:CPRE England tranquillity map.jpg|frame|right|2007 Tranquillity map of England. Green areas denote very tranquil areas, whereas red areas denote areas with much less tranquillity.]]

The first method of mapping tranquillity was developed by Simon Rendel of ASH Consulting for a [[Department of Transport]] study in 1991. This led to the production of a set of Tranquil Area maps covering England, produced by Rendel and ASH Consulting and published by the [[Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE)]] and the former [[Countryside Commission]].

In these maps ''tranquil areas'' were defined as ''places sufficiently far from the visual or noise intrusion of development or traffic to be considered unspoilt by urban influences''.

More sophisticated mapping techniques are now available following work by researchers at [[Northumbria University]], [[Newcastle University]], and [[Campaign to Protect Rural England|CPRE]].

Maps have been produced for the whole of [[England]] that show the tranquillity score of [[Ordnance Survey]] Grid derived 500mx500m squares. The tranquillity rating for these is based on 44 different factors that add to or detract from people’s feelings of tranquillity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.surrey.ac.uk/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/ENG/RESEARCH/CES/EVENTS/ABSTRACTSANDPPTS/MAPPING%20TRANQUILLITY%20ANDREW%20OLIVER%202007.PDF] Presentation given by Andrew Oliver on Tranquillity to the University of Surrey, retrieved 2 Nov 2007&lt;/ref&gt; These factors were defined following extensive public consultations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpre.org.uk/filegrab/saving-tranquil-places-report.pdf?ref=2583 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013142009/https://www.cpre.org.uk/filegrab/saving-tranquil-places-report.pdf?ref=2583 |archivedate=2007-10-13 |df= }} ''Saving Tranquil Places'', CPRE report on Tranquillity, retrieved 2 Nov 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The new methodology uses advanced modelling techniques to look at the diffusion of the impact of these factors over distance, taking into account the terrain of the land. For example, the tranquillity increases gradually the further one is from a busy road, but increases more sharply if the road is hidden in a cutting.

The mapping process was developed by Northumbria and Newcastle Universities. The dark green areas represent those with the highest composite tranquillity score; dark red areas have the lowest composite tranquillity score (i.e., are least tranquil).

===Stimuli with positive impacts on tranquillity===
*a natural landscape, including woodland
*presence of rivers, streams, lakes or the sea
*birds and other wildlife
*wide open spaces
*clear open night sky with/without moon
*beach in a unique location
*open field,flora etc. with gentle to moderate wind flow

===Examples of stimuli having negative impacts on tranquillity===
*Motorised [[transport]]: [[car]]s, [[motorbikes|motorcycle]], [[train]]s and [[aircraft]] – and [[road]]s and [[railway]]s
*[[light pollution]]
*[[crowd|large numbers]] of people
*[[Electricity pylon|pylon]]s, [[electric power transmission|power line]]s, masts and [[wind turbine]]s
*[[Noise (sound)|noise]]

Note: This cartographic study showed that tranquillity is not the absence of all noise, activity and buildings. Indeed, it found that many rural activities, such as farming and hiking, and natural noises such as birdsong and cows lowing, enhance people’s experience of tranquillity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5599">'''Water torture''' encompasses a variety of techniques using [[water]] to inflict physical or psychological harm on a victim as a form of [[torture]] or execution.

==Forced ingestion==
{{Main|Water cure (torture)}}
In this form of water torture, water is forced down the throat and into the stomach. It was used as a legal torture and execution method by the courts in [[France]] in the 17th and 18th century. At the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century it was used against [[Philippines|Filipinos]] by American Forces during the [[Philippine–American War]] and was employed against [[British Commonwealth]], [[United States|American]] and [[China|Chinese]] prisoners during [[World War II]] by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Knights of Bushido: A Short History of Japanese War Crimes'' by Edward Frederick Langley Russell, Baron Russell of Liverpool (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Human Rights Watch]] organization reports that in the 2000s, security forces in [[Uganda]] sometimes forced a detainee to lie face up under an open water [[spigot]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]], [http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/04/27/china10549.htm#UGANDA Human Rights News: Torture Worldwide]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Water intoxication]] can result from drinking too much water. This has caused some fatalities over the years in [[Fraternities_and_sororities_in_North_America|fraternities]] in [[North America]] during initiation week.  For example, a person was [[hazing|hazed]] to death by [[Chi Tau]] of [[Chico State]] (California) in 2005 via the forcing of pushups and the drinking of water from a bottle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5012154|title=A Fraternity Hazing Gone Wrong|last=Korry|first=Elaine|date=November 14, 2005|publisher=NPR|accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fear of drowning==
{{Main|Waterboarding}}
Waterboarding refers to a technique involving water poured over the face or head of the subject, in order to evoke the instinctive fear of [[drowning]]. Often a wet cloth is placed in the subject's mouth, giving them the impression that they are drowning.&lt;!-- there have been many claims that this torture is used. Although it is common belief that waterboarding merely simulates the fear of drowning, however the technique is actually a slow and controlled system of drowning.--&gt;

==Dripping water==
{{Main|Chinese water torture}}
What is called the "[[Chinese water torture]]" was a torture described by [[Hippolytus de Marsiliis]] in the 16th century that was supposed to drive its victim insane with the stress of water dripping on a part of the forehead for a very long time.  It may also be characterised by the inconsistent pattern of water drips.  There are no expert opinions on the true cause of torture in this method.

==Dunking==

This form of torture was used in the early modern period as a [[trial by ordeal]].

*Supposedly, the [[Rasphuis]] in [[Amsterdam]], a 17th-century institution that attempted to rehabilitate young male criminals through labor, contained a "water dungeon," the so-called ''Waterhuis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pol|first=Lotte van der|title=Het Amsterdams hoerdom: prostitutie in de zeventiende en achttiende eeuw|year=1996|publisher=Wereldbibliotheek|page=192|quote=Het rasphuis had opvallend genoeg ook een hardnekkige mythe. In dit tuchthuis voor mannen zou een 'waterhuis' of verdrinkingscel zijn waarin gevangenen werden gezet die niet wilden werken.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If prisoners refused to work they were placed in a cellar that quickly filled with water after a [[sluice]] was opened, and were handed a [[pump]] that enabled them to keep from drowning. [[Geert Mak]] and other authors, however, point out that there is no evidence whatsoever for the existence of this room and this punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mak|first=Geert|title=Een kleine geschiedenis van Amsterdam|year=1994|publisher=Atlas|isbn=978-90-254-0416-1|page=180|quote=[[Jacob Bicker Raye]] en enkele anderen melden zelfs het - overigens onbevestigde - bestaan van een 'waterhuis'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[House of Terror]] in [[Budapest]], Hungary, shows examples of water torture used by the Nazi and Arrow Cross Parties against the Jews. One involves a sunken cell filled with ice cold water; the prisoner must stand on a tiny metal plinth in the centre of the room. When the prisoner becomes tired or falls asleep, they will fall from the plinth into the icy water.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
* The water torture as inflicted in medieval Europe was sometimes intensified by mixing hot peppers, vinegar, and even urine with the water.  Central Asian tribes commonly inflicted the water torture with urine.  The Vietnamese have dunked prisoners in a tank filled with urine and feces as a form of torture. {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}
* In the 19th century, various U.S. newspapers published details of "water torture" (or the "torture of thirst") in Japan which involved subjecting the victim to a high salt diet for several days, without rice or water, and then offering them water in exchange for a confession: "it is "difficult to imagine a more cruel device."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/65554468/?terms=%22water+torture%22|title=31 May 1879, Page 4 - The Newton Enterprise at Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
