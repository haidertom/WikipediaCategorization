'''Akvavit Theatre''' is a theater company in Chicago with a focus on Scandinavian works. While the company began performances in October 2010, it was born out of the "Nordic Spaces" project which was funded by the [[Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation]], which began in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akvavittheatre.org/page1/page1.html |publisher=Akvavit Theatre |title=About Us |accessdate=May 27, 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qmqqz4pl?url=http://www.akvavittheatre.org/page1/page1.html |archivedate=May 28, 2017 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4608">The '''antiquarian book trade in the United States''' is an aspect of [[book collecting]] and [[publishing]]. The term ''[[antiquarian]]'', in general, refers to [[antiquities]] and collectible items usually considered old and rare, usually in reference to books, but is not limited to books. The word antiquarian could also be used to describe a person who collects rare books or other antique items. 

Two key figures who have written a great deal on the U.S. antiquarian book trade specifically are [[Leona Rostenberg]] (1908&amp;ndash;2005) and [[Madeleine B. Stern]] (1912&amp;ndash;2007), both of whom were also in the business of collecting and selling [[rare books]]. Other histories having covered the topic include [[Isaiah Thomas (publisher)|Isaiah Thomas]], writing in 1810 his ''History of printing in America''; Henry Walcott Boynton’s ''Annals of American Bookselling, 1638-1850'', first published in 1932; Hellmut Lehmann-Haupt’s ''The Book in America: A History of the Making, the Selling, and the Collecting of Books in the United States'' (1939).

The antiquarian book trade has roots in Colonial America, and may be considered in the study of American history and literature, print culture, and book history. Antiquarian book fairs have long been an important aspect of the trade. Today, the [[Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America]] (ABAA) is the primary organization of the trade in the United States. Other organizations include the [[Society for the History of Authorship, Reading and Publishing]] (SHARP). The [[Rare Book School]] at the University of Virginia is the premier institution for those seeking an advanced education in the field.

==History==

The beginnings of the antiquarian book trade can be traced to British North America, specifically Boston of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].&lt;ref&gt;Stern, M. B. (1985). Antiquarian bookselling in the United States: A History from the origins to the 1940s. Westport, CT: Greenwood. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; There is no established date of when this business of book collecting actually begins, however Stern attributes the beginnings to [[John Dunton]]’s visit to Boston in 1686, in which he brought along numerous books from his native England. Printed materials and books however were already available in Boston, the first book shop having been opened in 1647 by [[Hezekiah Usher]].&lt;ref&gt;  tern, M. B. (1985). Antiquarian bookselling in the United States: A History from the origins to the 1940s. Westport, CT: Greenwood. p. 3p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The act of collecting and selling books as a form of business increases later in seventeenth century, with 1693 being the date of the earliest printed catalogue of books in the American colonies.     

Events in Boston during the eighteenth century proved both difficult and advantageous for the antiquarian book trade. For example, a fire broke out in 1711 that consumed nearly every bookshop then in existence in Boston. In the next two decades antiquarian booksellers rebuilt and gradually began to thrive, with the presence of [[Harvard College]], as well as a certain literary and educational milieu in Boston allowing the development of the antiquarian book trade.

In the later eighteenth century, the heart of the antiquarian trade shifted to Philadelphia and New York City, growing with an increasingly educated public and independence from Britain. With the movement of people westward bookselling spread, and soon, small cities like Cincinnati become known in the book trade.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, W. (1961). The Western book trade: Cincinnati as a nineteenth century publishing and book-trade center. Columbus, OH: Ohio State University. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The trade spread to Richmond and New Orleans, then to Texas,  St. Louis, Chicago, and eventually, following the gold rush, to California.

[[Carl Nielsen]]'s '''''At the Bier of a Young Artist''''' (''Ved en ung Kunstners Baare'') for string orchestra, FS 58, was written for the funeral of the Danish painter [[Oluf Hartmann]] in January 1910.

==Background==
 
Oluf Hartmann was the son of composer [[Emil Hartmann]] and the brother of Bodil Neergaard, the lady of [[Fuglsang Manor]], a gathering place for musicians and artists on the [[Denmark|Danish]] island of [[Lolland]]. Hartmann died on Sunday, 16 January 1910. By the following Wednesday, Nielsen had completed the draft of his "Andante lamentoso". Perhaps originally written for string quartet, the piece was later adapted by the composer for string orchestra.&lt;ref name="Bier"&gt;Niels Bo Foltmann, "At the Bier of a Young Artist", Orchestral Works 2, [http://www.kb.dk/en/kb/nb/mta/cnu/forord_kilder.html Carl Nielsen Edition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409070144/http://www.kb.dk/en/kb/nb/mta/cnu/forord_kilder.html |date=April 9, 2010 }}, ''Royal Danish Library''. Retrieved 13 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The four-minute piece in [[E-flat minor]] was first performed by the Gade Quartet at Oluf Hartmann’s funeral on 21 January in the chapel at [[Holmens Cemetery|Holmen’s Cemetery]] in [[Copenhagen]]. By April 1912, Nielsen had adapted it for strings in connection with an Easter concert he conducted at the [[Church of Our Lady (Copenhagen)|Church of Our Lady]] in Copenhagen. He conducted the piece on several other occasions during his lifetime and it was also played at his funeral on 9 October 1931 by his son-in-law [[Emil Telmányi]]'s chamber orchestra.&lt;ref name="Bier"/&gt;   

The piece has been known under different names. It was first entitled "Andante doloroso" for the concerts in Copenhagen in 1912 and then it became known as "Andante dolorosa (Ved en ung Kunstners Baare)" or "Andante dolorosa (At the Bier of a Young Artist)".&lt;ref name="Bier"/&gt;

==Music==

Writing in connection with Deutsche Grammophon's recording by the Emerson String Quartet, Anthony Burton writes: "In the dark key of E flat minor, with an initially subdued middle section in D major and a calm major-key ending, it has a poignant intensity quite remarkable for a work of its modest duration".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutschegrammophon.com/special/insights.htms?ID=emerson-intimatevoices Anthony Burton, "Northern Voices"], ''Deutsche Grammophon''. Retrieved 13 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Auguste Nicolas Trémont''' (31 December 1892 – 23 October 1980) was a [[Luxembourger]] [[painter]], [[sculptor]], and [[medallist]]. He specialised in [[sculpture]]s of animals, with a particular emphasis on [[big cat]]s.

==Life==
After spending his childhood in Luxembourg, Auguste Tremont moved to [[Paris]] where he enrolled at the [[École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs|Ecole des Arts décoratifs]] in 1909. [[World War I]] caught him by surprise while he was visiting Luxembourg. As he tried to make his way back to Paris by passing through [[Switzerland]], he was arrested by German forces near the Swiss border and was imprisoned. Once released from detention, he returned to Luxembourg where he remained until the end of the war in 1918, working in a steel factory in [[Dudelange]] This work gave him the opportunity to practice his skills by drawing pictures of steel workers in action; he also befriended future [[Arbed]] president [[Aloyse Meyer]].

At the end of the war, Trémont returned to Paris where he studied at the [[Ecole des Beaux Arts]]. He first specialized in portraits and pictures of Paris and still life. This changed when he visited the [[Jardin des Plantes]], the [[zoological gardens]], where he found the subjects that were to become his main area of specialization: animals. Later in his life, when asked why he chose to represent animals, he replied: “because it was the most difficult task”.

In 1924, Trémont made his first [[sculptures]], and he subsequently developed his skills as a sculptor by creating animal sculptures in a variety of sizes and species. The late 1920s-early 1930s were his most productive years; it is during this period that he sculpted, in Paris, two large lions that now decorate the entrance of the [[Luxembourg City Hall]]. He spent [[World War II]] in Paris, and returned to Luxembourg at the end of the war where he created [[monuments]] for the victims of the war. He later returned to his wonderful detailed still life and oil paintings of flowers and portraits. 

Tremont's work was made available to the public through the Ruhlmann art gallery, then later Edgar Brandt and Malesherbes art galleries. His work is also represented on numerous Luxembourgian stamps.

== Major works ==

Works by Trémont adorn some of the most prominent buildings in his hometown of [[Luxembourg City]] {{citation needed|date=December 2016}}, including [[Notre-Dame Cathedral, Luxembourg|Notre-Dame Cathedral]] and [[Luxembourg City Hall]].  He also created sculptures for the Luxembourgish pavilions at the [[Exposition universelle et internationale (1935)|Brussels 1935]] and [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|Paris 1937]] [[World's Fair]]s.

[[File:Chethams library interior.jpg|thumb|Bookcases in [[Chetham's Library]], Manchester]]
[[File:A Book Shelf.jpg|thumb|200px|A bookcase in a home.]]
A '''bookcase''', or '''bookshelf''', is a piece of [[furniture]] with horizontal [[shelf (storage)|shelves]], often in a [[cabinetry|cabinet]], used to store [[book]]s or other printed materials. Bookcases are used in private homes, public and university libraries, offices and bookstores. Bookcases range from small, low models the height of a table to high models reaching up to ceiling height. Shelves may be fixed or adjustable to different positions in the case. In rooms entirely devoted to the storage of books, such as libraries, they may be permanently fixed to the walls and/or floor. 

A bookcase may be fitted with glass doors&lt;ref name="Bookcase"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bookcase|title=Bookcase|publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be closed to protect the books from dust or moisture. Bookcase doors are almost always glazed with glass, so as to allow the spines of the books to be read. Especially valuable rare books may be kept in locked cases with wooden or glazed doors. A small bookshelf may also stand on some other piece of [[furniture]] such as a [[desk]] or [[Chest (furniture)|chest]]. Larger books are more likely to be kept in horizontal piles and very large books flat on wide shelves or on [[coffee table]]s.

In Latin and Greek the idea of bookcase is represented by ''Bibliotheca'' and ''Bibliothēkē'' (Greek: βιβλιοθήκη), derivatives of which mean ''library'' in many modern languages. A bookcase is also known as a ''bookshelf'', a ''bookstand'', a [[cupboard]] and a ''bookrack''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://freethesaurus.net/s.php?q=bookcase|title=Bookcase|publisher=Free Thesaurus|accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a library, large bookshelves are called "stacks."

==History ==

Private libraries appeared during the late Roman republic: [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] inveighed against libraries fitted out for show by illiterate owners who scarcely read their titles in the course of a lifetime, but displayed the scrolls in bookcases (''[[armaria]]'') of citrus wood inlaid with ivory that ran right to the ceiling: "by now, like bathrooms and hot water, a library is got up as standard equipment for a fine house (''[[domus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''De tranquillitate animi'' ix.4–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolving bookcases, known as ''zhuanluntang'', have been documented in [[History of China#Ancient China|imperial China]], and its invention is credited to Fu Xi in 544.&lt;ref name="Chinese Classical Furniture"/&gt; Descriptions of revolving bookcases have been found in 8th- and 9th-century Chinese texts. Revolving bookcases were popularized in Buddhist monasteries during the [[Song Dynasty]] under the reign of [[Emperor Taizu of Song|Emperor Taizu]], who ordered the mass printing of the Buddhist [[Tripiṭaka]] scriptures.&lt;ref name="Chinese Classical Furniture"/&gt; An illustration of a revolving bookcase is depicted in Li Jie's architectural treatise the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]''.&lt;ref name="Chinese Classical Furniture"&gt;{{cite book|title=Austere Luminosity of Chinese Classical Furniture.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-EKkblrm6sUC&amp;pg=PA247|year=2001|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-21484-2|pages=246–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When books were written by hand and were not produced in great quantities, they were kept in small boxes or chests which owners (usually the wealthy aristocrats or clergy) carried with them. As [[manuscript]] volumes accumulated in [[religious house]]s or in homes of the wealthy, they were stored on shelves or in [[cupboard]]s. These cupboards are the predecessors of today's bookcases. Later the doors were removed, and the evolution of the bookcase proceeded. Even then, however, the volumes were not arranged in the modern fashion. They were either placed in piles upon their sides, or if upright, were ranged with their backs to the wall and their edges outwards. The band of [[leather]], [[vellum]] or [[parchment]] which closed the book was often used for the inscription of the title, which was thus on the fore-edge instead of on the spine. Titles were also commonly written onto the fore-edge.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Bookcase |volume=4 |page=221 |first=James George Joseph |last=Penderel-Brodhurst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the invention of [[printing]] had greatly reduced the cost of books, thus allowing many more people  access to owning books, that it became the practice to write the title on the spine and shelve books with the spine outwards. Early bookcases were usually of [[oak]], which is still deemed by some to be the most appropriate wood for an elegant [[library]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The oldest bookcases in England are those in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University, which were placed in position in the last year or two of the sixteenth century; in that library are the earliest extant examples of shelved galleries over the flat wall-cases. Long ranges of book-shelves are somewhat severe in appearance, and many attempts have been made by means of carved cornices and pilasters to give them a less austere appearance. These attempts were most successful as in the hands of the English cabinetmakers of the second half of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[Image:Frederick Augusta Barnard01.jpg|thumb|right|The Octagon Library, George III's original library at [[Buckingham Palace|Buckingham House]], showing wall bookcases]]

==Designers and manufacturers==
Both [[Thomas Chippendale|Chippendale]] and [[Thomas Sheraton|Sheraton]] made or designed many bookcases, mostly glazed with little [[lozenge]]s encased in [[fretwork]] frames, often of great charm and elegance. In the eyes of some, the grace of some of Sheraton's [[satinwood]] bookcases has rarely been equalled. The French cabinetmakers of the same period were also highly successful with small ornamental cases. [[Mahogany]], [[rosewood]] satinwood and even choicer exotic timbers were used; they were often inlaid with [[marquetry]] and mounted with chased and gilded bronze. Dwarf bookcases were frequently finished with a slab of choice marble at the top.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

In 1876, [[John Danner]] of [[Canton, Ohio]], invented a revolving bookcase with a patented "pivot and post" design.  The ingenuity of his work resided in the economy of space it provided. Thirty-two volumes of the American Cyclopedia could be stored in a compact space, and readily available for perusal at the touch of a finger.  Danner's bookcase appeared in the 1894 [[Montgomery Ward]] catalog.  In 1878 he exhibited his bookcases at the Paris International Exhibition and won a gold medal.  The John Danner Manufacturing Company was known for honorable workmanship and affordability. The woods were oak, black walnut, western ash, and Philippine mahogany.  Viewed as a progressive businessman, Danner was credited with drawing a large trade and business to the city of Canton.&lt;ref&gt;Kenney, Kimberly.

==Library shelving==
In the great public libraries of the twentieth century, multilevel [[Library stack|stacks]] often served as both structure and shelving,&lt;ref name="ELH"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wiegand|first=Wayne, ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Library History|year=1994|publisher=Garland|pages=352–355}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[iron]], as in the [[British Museum]] where the shelves are covered with [[cowhide]]; or [[steel]], as in the [[Library of Congress]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]; or of [[slate]], as in the [[Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge|Fitzwilliam Library]] at [[Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

===Systems of arrangement===
[[File:Rainbow Bookshelf.jpg|thumb|Bookshelf arranged by color]]
There are three common ways of arranging stationary bookcases: flat against the wall; in stacks or ranges parallel to each other with merely enough space between to allow for the passage of a librarian; or in bays or alcoves, where cases jut out into the room at right angles to the wall-cases. The stack system is suitable only for public libraries where economy of space is essential; the bay system is not only handsome but utilizes the space to great advantage.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The library of the [[City of London]] at the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] is a peculiarly effective example of the bay arrangement.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

For libraries where space is extremely tight there is yet another system, usually called [[Mobile shelving|mobile aisle shelving]]. In such systems rows of bookcases are mounted on wheels and packed tightly together with only one or more aisles between them. It is possible then to visit only two bookcase sides at a time, all the others being pressed close together. A gearing mechanism allows users to move the bookcases and open the aisle in the desired location. Because of the danger of tripping on the floor-mounted rails or being crushed between bookcases, these systems may have electronic sensors and/or recessed track, or may be reserved for closed stacks where access is restricted.

==Barrister's bookcase==
[[File:American homes and gardens (1912) (18127546046).jpg|thumb|Advertisement for Globe-Wernicke Bookcases of Cincinnati, Ohio (1912)]]
A [[barrister]] requires the use of many law books and would formerly travel on [[circuit court|circuit]] with a judge's court. A specialised form of portable bookcase has thus been developed to meet their needs. A  barrister's bookcase consists of several separate shelf units that may be stacked together to form a cabinet. An additional plinth and hood complete the piece. When moving chambers, each shelf is carried separately without needing to remove its contents and becomes a carrying-case full of books.

As most high-quality bookcases are closed by doors{{fact|date=February 2018}}, but also to retain the books when being carried, a barrister's bookcase has glazed doors. As the shelves must still separate it's not possible to provide the usual hinged doors opening sideways and so instead they use an "up and over" mechanism on each shelf. The better quality cases use a metal [[scissor mechanism]] inside the shelves to ensure that the doors move in a parallel fashion without skewing and jamming. Many of this style, exported worldwide, were made by the Skandia Furniture Co. of [[Rockford, Illinois]] around the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="FWW, Barrister" &gt;{{cite journal
 |title=How to Build a Barrister's Bookcase
 |last=Greef |first=Jeff
 |journal=[[Fine Woodworking]]
 |date=September–October 1992
 |pages=51–55
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This style of bookcase was either made in a [[Dickens]]ian period, or harkens back to the style of such times, so they're most commonly glazed with a [[leaded light]] and small panes of glass.

Each shelf of a true barrister's bookcase must be portable with a heavy load of books. The more robust examples have folding handles at the ends of each shelf. Modern "decorator" copies of these may ''look'' the same, but are often too lightly constructed to be carried whilst loaded, or may even be simply a single fixed case as per a normal bookcase, but with separate doors to each shelf to give the appearance of a barrister's bookcase.

==Writing ==
;Practical
*The construction and arrangement of bookcases was learnedly discussed in the light of experience by W. E. Gladstone in the ''Nineteenth Century'' for March 1890,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; entitled "On Books and the Housing of Them". An early type of mobile shelving made of steel is sometimes said to have been invented by Gladstone.
*''The Book on the Bookshelf'' by Henry Petroski (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1999) also discusses the shelving of books in some detail.
*''Living with Books'' by Alan Powers (London: Mitchell Beazley, 1999) deals with accommodating books at home.
*''Lunacy &amp; the Arrangement of Books'' by [[Terry Belanger]] (New Castle, Del.: Oak Knoll Press, 2003) also deals with the subject.
*''The Pictorial Catalogue; mural decoration in libraries: the Lyell Lectures, Oxford 1972-1973'' by André Masson (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981) deals with the systems used in early modern European libraries.
*See also:
**[[Sympson the Joiner]] and the early glazed bookcases made for [[Samuel Pepys]]
**The [[Cottonian Library]] where each bookcase was named after a prominent figure in ancient Rome whose bust stood on the top.

;Literature and film
*In several stories, a [[hidden passage|secret area]] is hidden behind a bookcase built into the wall. The entrance is typically opened when a particular book on the shelf is pulled off or uses a switch in a statue, usually under the head. One particularly humorous example is found in the film ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', when Doctor Frankenstein's laboratory is opened via a bookcase triggered by a candle.
*[[H. C. Bunner]] wrote a comic poem "Shake, Mulleary and Go-ethe" "I have a bookcase which is what / Many much better men have not / There are no books inside, for books / I am afraid might spoil its looks, etc."&lt;ref&gt;''The Penguin Book of Comic and Curious Verse'', ed. [[J. M. Cohen]]  1952&lt;/ref&gt;
*In this passage from [[Lucy Maud Montgomery]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.online-literature.com/lucy_montgomery/|title=Lucy Maud Montgomery|publisher=iThe Literature Network|accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; novel ''Anne of Green Gables'', the author refers to a bookcase; "Thomas she{{clarify|date=August 2012}} had a bookcase in her sitting room with glass doors."&lt;ref name="Bookcase"/&gt;

'''''Bourke Street''''' is a [[1886 in art|1886]] painting by Australian artist [[Tom Roberts]]. Roberts originally titled the work '''''Allegro con brio'''''.&lt;ref name="NLA"&gt;{{cite web|title= Bourke Street, Melbourne (picture) / Tom Roberts. |url=http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/cdview?pi=nla.pic-an2268340&amp;fullrecord=yes|work=Digital collections|publisher=National Library of Australia|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting depicts the western end of [[Bourke Street, Melbourne|Bourke Street]], one of the main thoroughfares in [[Melbourne]] as seen from the [[Buckley &amp; Nunn]] drapery.&lt;ref name="EMelbourne"&gt;{{cite web|last=Spate|first=Virginia|title=Bourke Street (Tom Roberts)|url=http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM00220b.htm|work=EMelbourne|publisher=University of Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Building typology''' refers to the study and documentation of a set of buildings which have similarities in their type of function or form. There are two ways of looking at the term "building typology". The first is a functional typology that categorizes buildings into groups by the similarity of their use.  A functional building typology under this definition may create groups such as hospitals, schools, and shopping centers (see more examples in the [[list of building types]] by use). The second is a typology that groups buildings according to their forms, which is explained is this article. Formal building typology may be based on configuration, format, or relationships of building to streets and each other. Any single functional type can be subdivided into formal types. For example, the residential functional type may be further subdivided into formal categories such as high rise towers, single family homes, duplexes, and townhouses. The townhouse building is one formal type that has a specific configuration: single units are placed side-by-side with others, vertically oriented up to four stories tall, and facing the street. Many more variations of this formal type are found around the world, each with variations that are the result of local materials, cultural habits, age and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Urban Housing Handbook|last=Firley|first=Eric|publisher=Wiley|year=2009|isbn=|location=Chichester, UK|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documenting a type is the process of discovering the elements of similar forms which are the same. Usually building types are distinguished by their basic form, site configuration, and scale, but not their specific architectural style, color, or even precise use.and are related to the era, the culture, and the environment in which they arise.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Architectural Composition and Building Typology|last=Cannigia|first=Gianfranco|last2=Maffei|first2=Gianluigi|publisher=Alinea|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Evolution of Urban Form: Typology for planners and architects|last=Scheer|first=Brenda|publisher=APA Books|year=2010|isbn=|location=Chicago, IL|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea of autonomous building types arose in part from the general Enlightenment notion of categorization, a prelude to scientific discovery. At first types were intended as ideal models, which could be variously copied. In this sense types were commonly used forms (a [[basilica]], for example), that were adapted over time in new buildings with quite different uses:  from [[Roman Forum|Roman fora]] to early church forms ([[St. Peter's Basilica]]), to 19th century train stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Architecture of the City|last=Rossi|first=Aldo|publisher=|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that these forms are very similar and are derived from each other is an important way of understanding typology:  types are evolved over time and therefor can convey a sense of history or cultural continuity. The idea of building types as formal configurations was enhanced by [[J.N.L. Durand]], who developed two important works, the ''Parallele (1799)'', a huge, handsome book that reproduced plans, elevations and sections of historic buildings at the same scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recueil et paralle des edifices de tout genre anciens et modern|last=Durand|first=Jean-Nicolas-Louis|publisher=Gille|year=1799|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He categorized them by formal types, so that their basic similarities could be recognized. Following this work, Durand also created a second book&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Precise of the lectures on architecture, with graphic portion|last=Durand|first=J.N.L|publisher=|year=1802|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that manipulated and reconfigured the classical elements of architecture—columns, walls, etc. in order to adapt them to new, emerging uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=J.N.L. Durand (1760-1834): Art and science of architecture|last=Villari|first=Sergio|publisher=Rizzoli International|year=1990|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durand's system, a language of architecture, demonstrated one essential characteristic of types: a way of designing that was neither entirely free of constraint nor overly prescribed.

==Documenting a building type==

Most buildings of any city can be recognized as belonging to a building type. In the US, for example, several residential types exist, such as garden apartments, townhouses, and high rise housing. Each of these may have many subtypes: even within one part of a city there may appear two or three predominant residential types such as a small post-WWII house or a strongly horizontal ranch house.  Anyone can begin to identify types simply by observing the common buildings in a place. Architectural and urban designers document types more thoroughly, by measuring them, dating them, noting similar changes to the type that arise over time, and identifying their recurring locations in the city.

==The uses of building typology in history and practice==
[[File:Delft Voldersgracht 1.JPG|thumb|Houses along the canal in Delft are a type common just to this area.]]
Building types are critical to architects because they are a starting point for designing. One need not reinvent the form if a common building type, say an office building, is wanted. Most architects develop a sense of common building types over time, even without acknowledging their importance. Architects know the approximate dimensions, bulk, site placement, and internal circulation that dictates most types. This allows them to work quickly to determine the parts of the design problem which are unique:  material, orientation, structure, specific dimensions, entrance, and so on.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One school of thought in Italy, started by Saverio Muratori, recognizes the importance of typology in providing continuity in the city.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These architects have been influential in recognizing the role of type for modern architecture, where the newest buildings are encouraged to actively assimilate many typological characteristics, without imitating historical styles. 
[[File:Duxton Road shophouses 2.JPG|thumb|A common type in Asia is the "shophouse" which has an open shop on the ground floor and rooms above for living.]]
Historians, anthropologists, and architectural historians use the documentation of type as a key to other characteristics in a city, for example events, political control, or economic changes. As theory tells us, when a type evolves over a period of time, this is an indication that conditions in the city have changed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Built for change: neighborhood architecture in San Francisco|last=Moudon|first=Anne Vernez|publisher=MIT Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Moudon documents changes in the types of an Alamo Square&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; neighborhood to tell a kind architectural, cultural and economic history. She also identifies the block, lot and street pattern as key to typological continuity. Multiple studies using this method have identified important building types, for example Chinese [[shophouse]]s, Shanghai's [[Shikumen]] housing, [[Terraced house|terrace housing]] in Great Britain, [[Courtyard neighborhood|Courtyard]] buildings in France, and the atrium houses found in many hot climates. Atrium types are also important for mosques, shopping malls, and some [[Atrium (architecture)|hotels]].

==Building type and urban design==

Common types are the building blocks of the city. Usually, a neighborhood streets and lots are laid out so that the common type can be built there. This occurs today in suburban subdivisions, but it has been a pattern in history, as well. This combination of types, streets and lots is called an [[urban tissue]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or a plan unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alnwick, Northumberland: a Study in Town-Plan Analysis|last=Conzen|first=M.R.G.|publisher=Institute of British Geographers|year=1960|isbn=|location=London|pages=|via=}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When studying a city, a designer identifies the common tissue patterns in place and may decide to link to them, imitate them, or otherwise recognize them as an historical artifact. A movement of urban theorists and practitioners in the US, [[New Urbanism]], has identified building typology as a key to defining more user-friendly places. In trying to preserve neighborhoods or building new ones, building types once again become the building blocks of the city, and may be codified in law as [[form-based code]]s.

The '''''Christ as the Suffering Redeemer'''''  is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Andrea Mantegna]], dated to c. 1488-1500 and housed in the [[Statens Museum for Kunst]], Copenhagen, Denmark.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==History==
The work is generally assigned to Mantegna's stay in Rome, due to stylistic similarities with the ''[[Madonna of the Quarry]]'', although other art historians considered it from the 1490s.

The painting appears in an inventory of the [[Gonzaga family]] from 1627, and it belonged to cardinal [[Silvio Valenti Gonzaga]] in 1763 when it became part of the Danish Royal, having been acquired by King [[Frederick IV of Denmark]] to make his collection equal to those of other European reigning families.

==Description==
The painting is signed on the edge of the marble base and his an original version of the traditional ''[[Pietà]]'' theme. Christ, portrayed with open hands to show all the wounds of the crucifixion, is raised on finely sculpted ancient sarcophagus.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

His body is wrapped in a metallic white drape, and his supported by two kneeling angels (a [[seraphim]] and a [[cherubim]]). On the left the tomb's cover is visible, while the background is occupied by a far landscape under the sunset light. On the right is the [[Calvary]] and a quarry in which two men are working a slab, a column and a statue. Two further workers can be seen in a grotto, illuminated by an internal source of light.  Finally, on the left are fields with shepherds and cattle and a walled city, [[Jerusalem]], at the feet of a rocky spur. Two pious women run a path to reach Jesus' tomb.

{{Culture of Kosovo}}
Cinematography in [[Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status}} in the [[Albanian language]] began its activities after the foundation of ''[[Kosovafilm]]'', which produced short movies, documentaries, cartoons and later feature movies. Since 2008, the central authority for cinematography in Kosovo is [http://www.qkk-rks.com/?id=1 Kosova’s Cinematography Center (KCC)] though there are numerous independent film companies active in Kosovo. Before Kosovafilm, there were no fully Kosovan movies for Kosovo. 

==History==

===Early beginning===
By 1937 on the territory of modern-day Kosovo (then within the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]), there were seven operating cinemas. There was one per town, located in [[Pristina]], [[Prizren]], [[Kosovska Mitrovica]], [[Gnjilane]], [[Uroševac]], [[Đakovica]], and [[Peć]]. Cinematography in the former Yugoslavia after World War II was developed in accordance with the criteria of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]]. Every republic in [[SFR Yugoslavia]] had centres of cinematography, so Kosovo not being a republic had access to these centres only through Belgrade to participate in documentary film production, artistic play and education framework for cinematography. With the formation of the cultural centre began Albanian-language cinematography in Kosovo. The first artistic film was realised in 1955, ''Esalon doktora M.'' but the first movie in Albanian was ''Uka i Bjeshkeve te Nemura''. This film is about Uka, who is an old [[Albanians|Albanian]] that lives in the mountains on the border of Yugoslavia ([[Kosovo]]) and [[Albania]]. As an honorable man, he must deal with his son who befriended Italian fascists during [[World War II]]. ''Era dhe lisi'' is the first completely Kosovan production movie.&lt;ref&gt;[[:sq:Historia e kinematografise dhe televizionit ne Kosove|Historia e kinematografisë dhe televizionit në Kosovë]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063792/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 IMDB, Uka i Bjeshkëve të nemura (original title)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehmetaj|first=Gani|title=Magjia e ekranit|year=2005|publisher=Kosovafilm|location=Pristina|isbn=9951-8672-1-9|page=209|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJoaAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kosovafilm industry===

[[File:Picture made by Shukri Kacaniku.jpg|thumb|Filming "When Spring Comes Late"-1979, Kosovo]]

'''The Kosovo film industry''' dates from the 1970s. On 20 February 1969, the parliament of Kosovo established ''Kosovafilm'', a state institution for the production, distribution and showing of films. Its initial director was the actor Abdurrahman Shala, followed by writer and noted poet Azem Shkreli, under whose direction the most successful films were produced. Subsequent directors of Kosovafilm were Xhevar Qorraj, Ekrem Kryeziu and Gani Mehmetaj. After producing seventeen feature films, numerous short films and documentaries, the institution was taken over by the Serbian authorities in 1990 and dissolved. Kosovafilm was reestablished after [[FR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] withdrawal from the region in June 1999 and has since been endeavoring to revive the film industry in Kosovo.

Kosovafilm produced eight feature films in BCS, mostly partisan war films, many of which were in collaboration with Filmske Novosti and Avala Film of Belgrade. Its first Albanian-language production was the film ''Kur pranvera vonohet'' (When Spring Comes Late), premiered on 12 July 1979 and was directed by Ekrem Kryeziu and was based on Fadil Hoxha's partisan diary. Perhaps the best known, and last of the nine Albanian-language feature films of the period, was ''Rojet e mjegulles'' (''The Keepers of the Fog''), premiered on 15 June 1988. It was also directed by lsa Qosja and starred Xhevat Qorraj, [[Enver Petrovci]], Florie Siarina and Cun Lajçi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fnbw1wsacSAC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=kosovafilm&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vzJ-ksIhX2&amp;sig=WBJW_XQL3O9YPGBeJ1GCCJATEMg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y5EjUc3fNNDptQb9wIGYCw&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=kosovafilm&amp;f=false Robert Elsie, Historical Dictionary of Kosovo] p60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern cinematography===

[http://www.qkk-rks.com/?id=1 Kosova’s Cinematography Center (KCC)] is public film fund and central authority for cinematography. Its objective is achieving goals on public interest on cinematography issues. It became a member of the pan-European organization –[[European Film Promotion]] (EFP). This decision was taken at the General Assembly of this organisation and it was announced in 2012. Kosovo became the 33rd member of this network organisation. In 2014 Kosovo Cinematography Center got accepted at the “Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences” that organizes the ceremony of “Oscar” awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efp-online.com/en/members/295/Republic-of-Kosovo/Kosova-Cinematography-Center European Film Promotion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa-ks.net/?page=2,115,1096&amp;offset=15 Ministry of foreign affairs], The Republic of Kosovo&lt;/ref&gt; Kosovo has participated in different international film festivals such as: [[Berlin International Film Festival]], [[Sundance Film Festival]], Monterrey international film festival, [[Melbourne International Film Festival]], [[Abu Dhabi Film Festival]], Winterthur Film Festival, [[Thessaloniki International Film Festival]], [[Warsaw International Film Festival]] etc. It has also won prizes in many of them.

[[Bekim Fehmiu]] was born on 1 June 1936 in [[Sarajevo]]. He was an ethnic Albanian and his family moved to the Kosovo region, where, as a 20-year-old amateur boxer and manual worker. His big break was the 1967 film [[I Even Met Happy Gypsies]], a subtle portrayal of Roma life which won two awards in Cannes and was nominated for an Oscar. In 1974 Fehmiu appeared in the title role The Adventures of Ulysses, with [[Irene Papas]] as Penelope, and in [[John Frankenheimer| John Frankenheimer's]] [[Black Sunday (1977 film)|Black Sunday]] (1977) he played a Palestinian terrorist alongside [[Robert Shaw (British actor)|Robert Shaw]] and [[Marthe Keller]].

The New York Times dubbed him the "Yugoslav heart-throb" for his youthful conquests and acquaintances with the likes of [[Brigitte Bardot]] and [[Ava Gardner]]. Decades after his last appearance on the screen, readers of a leading Italian women's magazine voted him one of the ten most attractive men of the 20th century. He committed suicide in his Belgrade apartment on 15 June 2010. According to his last wish, [[Bekim Fehmiu]]'s ashes were scattered across the river [[Prizren Bistrica|Bistrica]] near his hometown of [[Prizren]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/7877965/Bekim-Fehmiu.html The Telegraph, UK], Bekim Fehmiu&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Faruk Begolli]] was the most famous Kosovo Albanian actor and director in Yugoslavia (along with Bekim Fehmiu). He attended high school in Pristina and completed the academy of film in Belgrade (1966). Begolli played in more than 60 films, starting with [[Veljko Bulajić]]'s [[Looking Into the Eyes of the Sun|Pogled u zenicu Sunca]] (1966). He cooperated with director [[Puriša Đorđević]] in his films ''Podne'' (Noon), ''Jutro'' (The Morning), and ''San'' (The Dream). In the late 1980s, Begolli returned from Belgrade to Kosovo, where he worked at the University of Pristina as a professor at the Faculty of Drama. His last lead role was in Ekrem Kryeziu's ''Dashuria e Bjeshkeve te Nemuna'' (Love in the Damned Mountain), and his last piece was Etjet e Kosoves (Kosovo: Desperate Search), where he was also a co-scenarist. He died in 2007, after a long battle with cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0066800/bio IMDb], Faruk Begolli-biography&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arta Dobroshi]] is famous with her role in the screen drama Lorna’s Silence (winner of Best Screenplay at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival). This young actress achieved her international breakthrough and a nomination for the 2008 [[European Film Awards]]. Born in Pristina, she has played many stage roles in her country, as well as a leading role in the prize-winning German-Albanian production Magic Eye (2005), a film about the situation in Albania in 1997, when it was rocked by unrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2009/04_jury_2009/04_Jury_2009.html Berlinale], Arta Dobroshi&lt;/ref&gt; She starred in these movies:[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2369497/ Three Worlds](2012),  [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1572502/ Late Bloomers](2011), [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772761/ Baby (II)](2010), [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1186369/ Lorna's Silence ](2008), [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0494841/ The Sadness of Mrs. Snajdrova ](2008), [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0419934/ Magic eye](2005).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1671184/ IMDb ] Arta Dobroshi&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Compert Con Culainn''''' ({{lang-en|'''The Conception of Cú Chulainn'''}}) is an early medieval [[Ireland|Irish]] narrative about the conception and birth of the hero [[Cú Chulainn]]. Part of the [[Ulster Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]], it survives in two major versions.

==Manuscripts==

The tale exists in two main recensions. The earliest witness of the first version is the [[Lebor na hUidre]] (LU), compiled in the 12th century. The principal scribe (M) was responsible for writing down the main text, while a later reviser (H) erased the ending to make room for his own sequel from the time of Cú Chulainn's birth. According to H's notes, the text was included in the [[Cín Dromma Snechtai]], an 8th-century manuscript now lost. Further copies of Recension I have come down in six manuscripts of the 15th and 16th centuries, all of them in some way associated with [[Connacht]].&lt;ref&gt;Ó Concheanainn, "The textual tradition." p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second recension survives in Egerton 1782 and D IV 2, where they immediately follow the first.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Concheanainn, "The textual tradition." p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt; This recension is also called ''Feis Tige Becfholtaig'' “The feast of (or: passing of the night in) Becfholtach's house” in D IV 2.

==Summary==
In the earliest version of ''Compert Chon Culainn'', Cú Chulainn's mother [[Deichtine]] is the daughter and charioteer of [[Conchobar mac Nessa]], king of Ulster, and accompanies him as he and the nobles of Ulster hunt a flock of magical birds. Snow falls, and the Ulstermen seek shelter, finding a house where they are made welcome. Their host's wife goes into labour, and Deichtine assists at the birth of a baby boy. A mare gives birth to two colts at the same time. The next morning, the Ulstermen find themselves at the Brug na Bóinde (the neolithic mound at [[Newgrange]]). The house and its occupants have disappeared, but the child and the colts remain. Deichtine takes the boy home and raises him to early childhood, but he falls sick and dies. The god [[Lugh|Lug]] appears to her and tells her he was their host that night, and that he has put his child in her womb, who is to be called Sétanta. Her pregnancy is a scandal as she is betrothed to [[Sualtam]] mac Róich, and the Ulstermen suspect Conchobar of being the father, so she aborts the child and goes to her husband's bed "virgin-whole". She then conceives a son whom she names Sétanta.&lt;ref&gt;[[A.G. van Hamel]] (ed), ''Compert Con Culainn and Other Stories''. pp. 3-8.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been interpreted as a triple conception, marking the child out as someone special.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Markale]]. ''The Epics of Celtic Ireland: Ancient Tales of Mystery and Magic''. 2000. p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later, and better-known, version of ''Compert Con Culainn'', Deichtine is Conchobar's sister, and disappears from [[Emain Macha]], the Ulster capital. As in the previous version, the Ulstermen go hunting a flock of magical birds, are overtaken by a snowstorm and seek shelter in a nearby house. Their host is Lug, but this time his wife, who gives birth to a son that night, is Deichtine herself. The child is named Sétanta.&lt;ref&gt;Cross and Slover, ''Ancient Irish Tales. ''pp. 134-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nobles of Ulster argue over which of them is to be his foster-father, until the wise Morann decides he should be fostered by several of them: Conchobar himself; [[Sencha mac Ailella]], who will teach him judgement and eloquent speech; the wealthy [[Blaí Briugu]], who will protect and provide for him; the noble warrior [[Fergus mac Róich]], who will care for him and teach him to protect the weak; the poet [[Amergin mac Eccit|Amergin]], who will educate him, and his wife [[Findchóem]], who will nurse him. He is brought up in the house of Amergin and Findchóem on Muirthemne Plain in modern [[County Louth]], alongside their son [[Conall Cernach]].&lt;ref&gt;Kinsella, ''The Táin.'' pp. 23-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cueva de las Manos''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for '''Cave of Hands''') is a [[cave]] or a series of caves located in the [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Santa Cruz]], [[Argentina]], {{convert|163|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the town of [[Perito Moreno, Santa Cruz|Perito Moreno]].  It is famous for (and gets its name from) the [[cave painting|paintings]] of [[hand]]s. The art in the cave dates from 13,000 to 9,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/936 "Cueva de las Manos, Río Pinturas."] ''UNESCO World Heritage List.'' Retrieved 7 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Several waves of people occupied the cave, and early artwork has been [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon-dated]] to ca. 9300 [[Before present|BP]] (about 7300 BC).&lt;ref name=unesco /&gt; The age of the paintings was calculated from the remains of bone-made pipes used for spraying the paint on the wall of the cave to create [[silhouettes]] of hands.

The site was last inhabited around 700 AD, possibly by ancestors of the [[Tehuelche people]].&lt;ref name=unesco /&gt; It was entered on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999.

== Location ==
The cave lies in the valley of the [[Pinturas River]], in an isolated spot in the [[Patagonia]]n landscape.  It is most easily reached by a gravel road, which leaves [[National Route 40 (Argentina)|Ruta 40]] north of [[Bajo Caracoles]] and runs northeast to the south side of the [[Pinturas River Canyon|Pinturas Canyon]]. The north side of the canyon can also be reached by rough, but shorter, roads from Ruta 40.  A {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} path connects the two sides of the canyon, but there is no road link.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moon.com/destinations/argentina/southern-patagonia/interior-santa-cruz-province/rn-40-north/cueva-de-las-manos Moon Travel Guide, Argentina]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main cave measures {{convert|248|m|ft|abbr=on}} in depth, with an entrance {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, and it is initially {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. The ground inside the cave has an upward slope; inside the cave the height is reduced to no more than {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

== Artwork ==
The images of [[hand]]s are negative painted, that is, [[stencil]]led. Most of the hands are left hands, which suggests that painters held the spraying pipe with their right hand or they put the back of their right hand to the wall and held the spraying pipe with their left hand.

Besides these there are also depictions of human beings, [[guanaco]]s (''[[Guanaco|Lama guanicoe]]''),&lt;ref name=unesco /&gt; [[rhea (bird)|rheas]], [[felidae|felines]] and other animals, as well as [[geometry|geometric]] shapes, [[zigzag]] patterns, representations of the sun, and [[hunting]] scenes. The hunting scenes are [[naturalism (arts)|naturalistic]] portrayals of a variety of hunting techniques, including the use of [[bolas]].&lt;ref name=unesco /&gt; Bolas were weapons designed with cords, having weights on each end that were thrown at the legs of animals in order to trap them allowing them to be killed by hunters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-cueva-de-las-manos-cave-of-hands|title=Cave of Hands|website=Atlas Obscura|language=en|access-date=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar paintings, though in smaller numbers, can be found in nearby caves. There are also red dots on the ceilings, probably made by submerging their hunting bolas in ink, and then throwing them up.

The binder is unknown but the mineral pigments include iron oxides, producing reds and purples; [[kaolin]], producing white; [[Jarosite|natrojarosite]], producing yellow; and [[manganese oxide]], which makes black.&lt;ref name=unesco /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9141">'''Cultural probes''' (or '''design probes''') is a technique used to inspire ideas in a design process. It serves as a means of gathering inspirational data about people's lives, values and thoughts. The probes are small packages that can include any sort of artifact (like a map, postcard, camera or diary) along with evocative tasks, which are given to participants to allow them to record specific events, feelings or interactions. The aim is to elicit inspirational responses from people, in order to understand their culture, thoughts and values better, and thus stimulate designer's imaginations.Probes is one of the prominent approaches in the practice of co-designing. It is design-led approaches as described by the landscape of design research and practice. probes are usually used in the early front end of the design process. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanders|first=Elizabeth B.-N.|date=2014|title=Probes, toolkits and prototypes: three approaches to making in codesigning|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/citedby/10.1080/15710882.2014.888183?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=CoDesign|volume=10:1|pages=5-14|via=DOI}}&lt;/ref&gt;The probes were not designed to be analyzed, nor did we summarize what they revealed about the sites as an explicit stage in the process. Rather, the design proposals we produced reflected what we learned from the materials.&lt;ref name="Gaver"&gt;Gaver, W, Dunne, A., &amp; Pacenti, E,. Design: Cultural probes, Interactions, Vol 6, Issue 1, Jan/Feb 1999&lt;/ref&gt;Furthermore, probes were born to gather “fragmentary clues” about people’s “lives and thoughts” which means they are tools to inspire - others argue that they can be used to, provide relevant information and gather empathetic data.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LOI|first=DARIA|title=Reflective probes, primitive probes and playful triggers|url=https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1559-8918.2007.tb00079.x|journal=Ethnographic Praxis in Industry Conference Proceedings|volume=2007|issue=1|pages=232–245|doi=10.1111/j.1559-8918.2007.tb00079.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Cultural Probes was developed by Gaver, Dunne and Pacenti in 1999. They were inspired by the art movement [[Situationist International]]. 
This technique does not follow the scientific approach. It follows the artistic approach, which is characterized by being irrational, uncontrolled, getting inspiration, and cannot be analysed systematically. As Gaver pointed out , the conceptual concerns and specific techniques of various arts movements also influenced their probes design.&lt;ref name="Gaver" /&gt;

== Applications ==
Cultural probes can be used for idea generation, inspiration, values and dreams in a design process. 
The technique is about opening up the design space, instead of narrowing it. Cultural probes aim to seek out subjective thoughts, values and dreams and surprise and uncertainty is a key value.
The probes provoke inspirational responses by using a creative approach in questions instead of analytical and descriptive question usually asked in [[User Experience]] Research.&lt;ref name="Gaver_a"&gt;Gaver, W. W., Boucher, A., Pennington, S., and Walker, B. 2004. Cultural probes and the value of uncertainty. interactions 11, 5 (Sep. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;Cultural Probe kit is a vehicle for self-reporting by asking participants to observe, reflect upon and report their experiences which can lead to have better and deeper observation in a context where, due to privacy as well as time constraints, it is not possible to conduct full participant observations&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

Since the initial publication in 1999 of cultural probes in interactions, the use of probes has been interpreted broadly and used in a wide variety of projects within user experience. Some cases are grounded very much in the original cultural probes work, while, in other cases, ‘probes’ has become an umbrella term covering everything from [[Diary Studies]] to longitudinal user studies to field trips.&lt;ref&gt;Boehner, K., Vertesi, J., Sengers, P., and Dourish, P. 2007. How HCI interprets the probes. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. CHI ‘07.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the traditional design process, designers usually engage in making after the design opportunity has already been identified. Over the last 10 years, we have seen the focus shift to more varied forms and formats of making in the front end of the process. Today making has become an activity that both designers and co-designers can engage in during all phases of the process. Cultural probe is one of these making approaches, which is used in the very earliest phase of the design process, the focus is on using making activities for making sense of the future. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Probes' family ==
Since Bill Gaver and his colleagues developed ‘Cultural Probes’, they have been adopted and adapted. Here are some probes which are derived from Cultural Probes; Informational Probes, Technology Probes, Mobile Probes, Empathy Probes, Domestic Probes, Urban Probes, Reflective Probes, Primitive Probes. Each kinds of Probes bring users to account to members differently: for example, probes that log everyday actions do this quite differently from those that require describing dreams. Each makes different forms of action and interaction visible and in different ways. Most forms of Probes involve investigative participation. Participants engage in reflective participation – both in the standard sociological sense of becoming aware of actions and interactions and describing them in some way, and in the methodological sense of making actions accountable. However, there is also evidence of different forms of participation. Cultural Probes emphasis imaginative and playful participation, engaging participants in activities that promote the use of aspects of their lives that are more “ludic’ and less goal-driven. Empathy Probes emphasis emotional participation, seeking out participants’ effective responses both to things in their everyday lives and new technologies. Both Technology Probes and Mobile Probes emphasis reactive participation and, to some extent, a change in participation or disruptive participation. Participants have to react to these new technologies placed in their lives and to the disruption to their existing routines that they enforce. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=Connor|last2=Rouncefield|first2=Mark|date=2008-10-01|title=Probes and participation|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1795234.1795272|publisher=Indiana University|pages=194–197|isbn=9780981856100}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== After Probing ==
Probing will add strong element of making to the research which is based on literature and practical work. It is difficult to create a precise pattern of the design process for probes. "The problem and the solution go hand in hand, and there is no single answer or method for analyses the probe materials. An inspiring idea about things such as the overall appearance of the probe, a single probe article or a visual detail can tune up the probe design along with a consistent approach to the problem. Although the methodological instructions can in principle be taken to the extreme, the outcome finally depends on the agents, i.e., researchers, designers and even users in the case of probes. Practical instructions are helpful, but somebody conducting research must personally be tuned-in to receive signals, interpret them and be surprised at them, as well as tolerate the ambiguous nature of the probing process (and design)"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/Design_Probes.html?id=nCsmMQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Design Probes|last=Mattelmäki|first=Tuuli|date=2006|publisher=University of Art and Design|isbn=9789515582119|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Criticism ==

* It is hard to get scientifically valid information from data that is so subjective.
* The data generated it not suitable for deep analysis and requirements list.
* Participants are supposed to reflect upon and be inspired by the probes, but it can be hard to motivate participants doing it, as well as to get them to send the probes back.
* There is a risk of few returns.
* The wide variety of applications of and scientific approach to the probes has been criticized by Gaver and his colleagues as a misunderstood desire to rationalize and analyze the probe[s2.]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6312">'''Demaratus''' ({{lang-el|Δημάρατος}}), frequently called '''Demaratus of Corinth''', was the father of [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]], the fifth [[King of Rome]], and the grandfather or great-grandfather of [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], the seventh and last Roman king.

==Life==
Demaratus was a nobleman of the [[Dorians|Dorian]] House of the [[Bacchiadae]] at [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]].  Facing charges of sedition, in 655 BC he fled to [[Italy]], according to tradition settling in the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] city of [[Tarquinii]], where he married an Etruscan noblewoman.  They had two sons, Lucius and [[Arruns Tarquinius (son of Demaratus)|Arruns]].

According to tradition, Demaratus introduced [[Greek culture]] to mainland Italy, and brought potters from Corinth; Greek potters worked at Tarquinii and its port, [[Gravisca]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}  [[Tacitus]] reported that Demaratus brought literacy to the Etruscans.  According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], Demaratus' son or grandson was the first foreigner to visit [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], and make a dedication there.

==Descendants==
Through his sons, Demaratus was the ancestor of the Roman [[Tarquinia (gens)|gens Tarquinia]], and a forebear of several other notable Roman families.  By blood or marriage, his descendants included the last three kings of Rome, as well as the first two [[Roman consul]]s.

Demaratus had two sons, Lucius and Arruns Tarquinius.  Arruns died shortly before his father, who accordingly bequeathed all of his wealth to his remaining son, Lucius, unaware that Arruns' wife was pregnant with Demaratus' grandson.  Thus, in spite of his grandfather's wealth, the child, who was named [[Arruns Tarquinius (Egerius)|Arruns]] after his father, was born into poverty.  For this reason, he came to be called ''Egerius'', meaning "the needy one."

Like his father, Lucius Tarquinius married an Etruscan noblewoman, but as the son of a foreigner he was unable to attain high station at Tarquinii.  At the urging of his wife, [[Tanaquil]], Tarquin migrated to Rome, where even a foreigner might hope to gain rank and influence.  There he won the favour of the king, [[Ancus Marcius]], and when the king died, Tarquin was chosen to succeed him.  After subduing the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] town of [[Collatia]], the king placed his nephew, Arruns, in charge of the Roman garrison there.

Tarquin's daughter married [[Servius Tullius]], who succeeded him as the sixth king of Rome.  After a long and prosperous reign, Tullius was deposed by his own son-in-law, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the son or grandson of the elder Tarquin.  An Etruscan legend told of how Servius, aided by the heroes Aulus and [[Caelius Vibenna]], had defeated and killed a group of enemies, including a certain Gnaeus Tarquinius of Rome, perhaps the son of Tarquin the Elder and father of Tarquin the Proud.

Many of the leading figures on both sides in the establishment of the Roman Republic were descendants of Demaratus.  In addition to the king, the king's wife was a descendant of Demaratus as her mother was the daughter of the elder Tarquin; and their three sons played prominent roles in the unfolding of events.  It was the rape of [[Lucretia]] by [[Sextus Tarquinius]] that inspired the Roman nobles to rebel against the king; [[Arruns Tarquinius (son of Tarquin the Proud)|Arruns Tarquinius]] and the Roman consul [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] slew one another in the first great battle of the Roman Republic; and [[Titus Tarquinius]] narrowly avoided death at the [[Battle of Lake Regillus]].  The Latin army that marched against the Romans on that occasion was commanded by [[Octavius Mamilius]], the dictator of [[Tusculum]], and a son-in-law of Tarquin's.

Meanwhile, the first two consuls were each descendants of Demaratus; Brutus' mother was the king's sister, while his colleague was [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]], the son of Egerius, and husband of Lucretia.  Before his death at the hands of Titus Tarquinius, Brutus compelled his colleague to resign and go into exile, arguing that none of the Tarquinian gens should hold power at Rome.

Three important Roman gentes claimed descent from Demaratus; the [[Junia (gens)|Junii]], through the first consul; the [[Mamilia (gens)|Mamilii]], who came to Rome from Tusculum in the fifth century BC; and the [[Tullia (gens)|Tullii]], through Servius Tullius.

'''''Disco Bloodbath: A Fabulous but True Tale of Murder in Clubland''''' is a 1999 memoir written by [[James St. James]] about his life as a [[Manhattan]] [[celebutante]] and [[club kid]].  The book specifically chronicles his friend [[Michael Alig]]'s rise to fame, and Alig and his roommate's subsequent murder of fellow club kid and drug dealer [[Andre Melendez|Andre "Angel" Melendez]]. St. James was Alig's mentor, rival, and collaborator in the Manhattan party scene, and was familiar with many of its key figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=metroactive.com|date=August 16, 1999|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sfmetro/08.16.99/discobloodbath-9931.html |title=Clubland Horrorcoaster (Celebutante Tell-All: 'Disco Bloodbath' is a drug epic spiked with celebrity and murder; James St. James illuminates the glamourous &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; monsters of the club scene)|author=Goldberg, Michelle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memoir was later retitled ''Party Monster'', after the [[Party Monster (2003 film)|2003 motion picture of that name]] starring [[Macaulay Culkin]], [[Seth Green]], [[Chloë Sevigny]], and [[Marilyn Manson]].

''Disco Bloodbath'' has since gone out of print{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} and often goes for several hundred dollars in auctions.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} It was only printed three times: in 1999, twice in paperback with different colored jackets, and once in hardcover. It was reprinted in 2003 under the title ''Party Monster - The Fabulous but True Tale of Murder in Clubland'' ({{ISBN|0-684-85764-2}}); paperbacks are widely available.

==Characters==

===Michael Alig===

'''George Philip Reinagle''' (1802 – 6 December 1835) was an English marine painter, youngest son of [[Ramsay Richard Reinagle]].&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{cite web | last =Graves  | first =R.

He was a pupil of his father, but he gained much facility in the treatment of marine subjects by copying the works of the Dutch painters [[Ludolf Backhuysen]] and [[Willem van de Velde]]. He exhibited first at the Royal Academy in 1822, when he sent a portrait of a gentleman; but in 1824 he contributed a 'Ship in a Storm firing a Signal of Distress', and a 'Calm', and in 1825 'A Dutch Fleet at the Seventeenth Century coming to Anchor in a Breeze', and other naval subjects in the following years.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

In 1827 he was present on board the Mosquito at the [[battle of Navarino]] and on his return he drew on stone, and published in 1828, 'Illustrations of the Battle of Navarin,' which was followed by 'Illustrations of the Occurrences at the Entrance of the Bay of Patras between the English Squadron and Turkish Fleets 1827. He also painted incidents of these engagements, which were exhibited in 1829, 1830 and 1831. He was present with the English fleet on the coast of Portugal in 1833 and his picture of 'Admiral Napier's Glorious Triumph over the Miguelite Squadron' was one of his contributions to the Royal Academy in 1834. Four naval subjects in 1835 were his last exhibited works. He worked both in oil and in watercolours, and gave much promise as a painter of shipping and marine pieces. His works appeared also at the [[British Institution]], and occasionally at the [[Royal Society of British Artists|Society of British Artists]].&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

Reinagle died at 11 Great Randolph Street, [[Camden Town]], London, on 6 December 1835, aged 33.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

The following glossary of words and terms (generally of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] origin) are related to '''[[owarai]]''' (Japanese comedy).  Many of these terms may be used in areas of [[Japanese culture]] beyond comedy, including [[television]] and [[radio]], [[music]]. Some have been incorporated into normal Japanese speech. __NOTOC__

==Glossary==

===bangumi===
:番組 (''bangumi'').  The Japanese word for [[television show]].

===boke===
:* Other Japanese meanings of [[Anglicisation|Anglicised]] spelling "boke":  [[Bokeh|'''Boke or bokeh'''&amp;mdash;blur in photography]], and, '''[[Japanese quince|'''Boke&amp;mdash;flowering Japanese quince]].'''  
:* For non-Japanese "boke,"'' see '''[[Boke (disambiguation)|Boke]]'''.

:ボケ (''boke''　{{IPA-ja|boke|}}).  From the verb bokeru 惚ける  or　呆ける, which carries the meaning of "senility" or "air headed-ness," and is reflected in this performer's tendency for misinterpretation and forgetfulness. '''The ''boke''''' is the "simple-minded" member of an [[#owarai|owarai]] [[#kombi|kombi]] (''[[manzai#Boke and tsukkomi|"tsukkomi and boke"]], or vice versa'') that receives most of the verbal and physical abuse from the "smart" [[#tsukkomi|tsukkomi]]  because of the boke's misunderstandings and slip-ups. '''The ''tsukkomi''''' (突っ込み) refers to the role the second comedian plays in ''"butting in"'' and correcting the boke's errors. It is common for tsukkomi to berate boke and hit them on the head with a swift smack; traditionally, tsukkomi often carried a fan as a multi-purpose prop, one of the uses for which was to hit the boke with.   ''Boke and tsukkomi'' are loosely equivalent to the roles of "funny man" or "comic" ''(boke)'' and "straight man" ''(tsukkomi)'' in the [[double act|comedy duos]] of western culture. Outside of owarai, boke is sometimes used in common speech as an insult, similar to "idiot" in English, or [[Baka (fool)|baka]] in Japanese.

===conte===
:コント (''konto''). From the [[French language|French]] word ''conte'', ''konto'' refers to the style of [[#manzai|manzai]] or [[owarai]] performance focusing on telling interesting tales, many of which, one must assume, are made up for the sake of humour. Also often called ''[[#manzai|manzai]] konto'' (漫才コント). Short conte (ショートコント) are skits often less than 30 seconds long where the comedians act out some sort of odd encounter or conversation.

===corner===
:コーナー (''kōnā''). Rarely taking the literal English meaning of the word "corner" as in "street corner" or "corner of a shape", this word is usually used in Japanese to mean "segment", as in "television segment".

===[[dajare]]===
:ダジャレ (''dajare''). A type of Japanese [[pun]] or [[word play]] in which the similarities in sound of two different words or phrases are used in a joke.

===dokkiri===
:ドッキリ (''dokkiri''). Recently popularized in the west by shows such as [[Punk'd]], these hidden-camera surprise pranks have been very common on Japanese television since the 90s. Traps such as pitfalls, falling objects, and seductive idols are often used.

===gag===
:ギャグ (''gyagu''). The same as the English word ''gag'', ''gyagu'' are generally cheap jokes (though the word often describes any joke) employed by a [[#geinin|geinin]] in their act. ''Gyagu'' tend to be short, physical, and often predictable.  American English speakers might say "a corny joke".

===geinin===
:芸人 (''geinin''). ''Gei'' means "performance" or "accomplishment", and the word ''geinin'' is often translated as "artisan". The un-abbreviated form of the word is 芸能人 (''geinōjin''), which means "performer" or "entertainer", but it is usually used in a context similar to the English "celebrity". Japanese comedians are usually called お笑い芸人 (''owarai geinin'', comedy performers) or お笑いタレント (''owarai tarento'', comedy talents) and talents that appear on television [[variety show]]s are usually called 芸能人タレント (''geinōjin tarento'', performing talents) or sometimes 若手芸人 (''wakate geinin'', young/newcomer talents) for newer additions to the talent pool. A ピン芸人 (''pin geinin'') is a solo stand-up performer.

===kire===
:キレ or 切れ (''kire''). A casual word for "anger" (similar to "pissed" or "ticked"), the キレ役 (''kireyaku'') is a role sometimes taken by [[#owarai|owarai]] [[#geinin|geinin]] who have very short tempers, or pretend to. [[Cunning (Owarai)|Cunning's]] [[Takanori Takeyama|Takeyama]] is well known for his short temper; his ''kire'' is his defining feature. Also, 逆ギレ (''gyaku gire'') is the act of getting angry at someone/something in reverse. For example: A girl cheats on her boyfriend, but then gets angry at her boyfriend when he finds out, insisting that it was his fault; a man trips on a rock while walking and swears at the rock, throwing it into the woods. This is a very common role in [[#owarai|owarai]] and [[#manzai|manzai]] performances.

===kombi===
:コンビ (''kombi''). An abbreviation of the English word "combination". Usually refers to the "combination" of two Japanese [[#owarai|owarai]] talents to form a comedy unit.

===konto===
:コント (''konto''). See [[#conte|conte]].

===Lumine===
:ルミネ (''rumine''). Short for "Lumine the Yoshimoto" (ルミネtheよしもと), ルミネ is a stage (劇場, ''gekijō'') in [[Shinjuku]]'s LUMINE2 building, exclusively for [[#owarai|owarai]] performances. It has considerable prestige as only the best performers in Japan ever get a chance to appear on this stage in front of a mere 500 live spectators.

===[[manzai]]===
:万歳, 万才, or (currently) 漫才 (''manzai''). A more traditional style of Japanese comedy.

===monomane===
:モノマネ or 物真似 (''monomane''). Usually impressions of other famous Japanese people, ''monomane'' is very common in Japan and some talents have even made a career out of their ''monomane'' skills. Some [[#geinin|geinin]] famous for their ''monomane'' are Korokke, Hori and [[Tomomitsu Yamaguchi|Gu-ssan]].

===[[owarai]]===
:お笑い (''owarai''). A general term for modern Japanese comedy.

===neta===
:ネタ (''neta''). Reverse spelling of the word ''tane'' (種), meaning "seed" or "pit". A ''neta'' is the background pretense of a konto skit, though it is sometimes used to refer to the contents of a segment of an [[#owarai|owarai]] act, a variety show, or a [[news]] broadcast. [[Warai Meshi]] almost won the 2004 M-1 Gran Prix by doing several acts on a neta about the somewhat poorly built human models in the Asuka Historical Museum in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. The neta of variety shows hosted by [[London Boots Ichigo Nigo]] almost always have to do with cheating girlfriends and boyfriends. See also [[#shimoneta|shimoneta]].

===pin geinin===
:ピン芸人 (''pin geinin''). See [[#geinin|geinin]].

===shimoneta===
:下ネタ (''shimoneta''). ''Shimoneta'' is the combination of the characters ''shimo'', meaning "low" or "down", and [[#neta|neta]]. A ''shimoneta'' is a dirty joke, usually focusing on sexual or revolting topics. Some [[#geinin|geinin]] are famous for their ''shimoneta''. For example, [[Takeshi Kitano|Beat Takeshi]] with his [[Nadia Comăneci|Comaneci]] gag, where the hands are thrust diagonally like the bottoms of a [[Gymnastics|gymnast's]] one-piece. Another equally well known comedian is Shimura Ken, who uses the character 'Henna Oji-san' to prowl amidst nubile girls.

===sur===
:シュール (''shūru''). From the [[French language|French]] word [[surrealism|surréalisme]], ''sur'' (sometimes [[romanization|romanized]] ''shule'') is comedy with no apparent reason or logic to it.  ''Sur'' itself is not very common, or popular, though many Japanese comedians are known to try out ''sur'' on occasion in their acts. ''Sur'' exploits the natural, uncomfortable feeling that occurs when people are confused and don't know how they are supposed to react to a meaningless or unexpected joke or comment, and so they just laugh. ''Sur'' may be compared to some of the unusual humor of the late [[United States|America]]n comedian [[Andy Kaufman]]. Strictly ''sur'' [[#kombi|kombi]] do exist, but it is extremely hard for ''sur'' performers to become popular.

===tsukkomi===
:突っ込み (''tsukkomi''). From the verb ''tsukkomu'' (突っ込む), meaning something like "butt in", this is often the role of the partner to the [[#boke|boke]] in an [[#owarai|owarai]] [[#kombi|kombi]]. The ''tsukkomi'' is generally the smarter and more reasonable of the unit, and will criticize, verbally and physically abuse, and generally rail at the ''boke'' for their mistakes and exaggerations. A typical ''tsukkomi'' often slaps the ''boke'' on the back of the head, an action always accompanied by an intentionally cheesy slapping [[sound effect]]. It is common for tsukkomi in [[#manzai|manzai]] to end an act with the phrase, "Let's quit!" (やめさしてもらいますわ！''Yamesashite moraimasu wa''!). The American equivalent is known as the [[Straight man (stock character)|straight man]].

===unchiku===
:うんちく or 蘊蓄 (''unchiku''). Literally a person's "stock of accumulated knowledge", ''unchiku'' usually refers to the act of complaining about something while teaching a lesson to an often uninterested audience. [[Cream Stew (comedy duo)|Cream Stew]] is known for ''unchiku''.

===ureteru===
:売れてる (''ureteru''). From the verb ''uru'' (売る), literally meaning "to sell", ''ureteru'' is often used in conversation referring to a performer's ability to sell their act (or themselves), and gives a little insight into the way many Japanese comedians think. An ''ureteru'' performer gets many more variety appearances, commercials, and pay from their agency than an ''uretenai'' (unable to sell) performer, and many performers determined to succeed will stop at almost nothing to promote themselves, and get "selling".

===variety bangumi===
:バラエティ番組 (''baraeti bangumi''). Though similar to the concept of [[variety show]] in English, shows in Japan often venture far from the  Western concept. [[Waratte Iitomo!]] and [[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!|Gaki no Tsukai]] are among the longest running TV variety shows still on air today.

'''Hendrick Dubbels''' or '''Hendrick Jacobsz. Dubbels''' and variants (1621–1707) was a [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] of [[marine art|marine subjects]] and winter landscapes, who spent much of his career working in the studios of other marine artists. 

Dubbels was born and lived his entire life in [[Amsterdam]].  He was the son of a diamond-cutter, and baptised in the [[Oude Kerk (Amsterdam)|Oude Kerk]] on May 2, 1621.  He married in 1651 and again in 1656, when he described himself as a "painter", but he is described as a "shopkeeper" in 1663 and 1665, when he was made [[bankrupt]].  He had been a "winkelier" or [[haberdasher]]-draper, "selling caps, [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]]s and [[stocking]]s".&lt;ref&gt;MacLaren, 115; and NMM&lt;/ref&gt;  This was presumably an unsuccessful attempt to escape from the highly competitive Amsterdam art world.&lt;ref&gt;NMM&lt;/ref&gt;  His earliest dated work is a drawing from 1641, with a dated painting from 1643.&lt;ref&gt;MacLaren, 115&lt;/ref&gt;  His marine style was initially based on that of [[Jan Porcellis]], then that of [[Simon de Vlieger]] in whose studio he worked c. 1650-3, bringing him into contact with [[Jan van de Cappelle]].&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 1650s were the period of his best work, including his winter landscapes, which were strongly influenced by those of Jan van de Cappelle, as were his tranquil marine scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, Slive, 219; MacLaren, 115&lt;/ref&gt;  He then worked for [[Willem van de Velde the Elder]] and his son Willem II until they left for London after the [[rampjaar]] ("Year of Disasters") of 1672.  In the late 1650s or early 1660s he trained [[Ludolf Bakhuizen]], the leading Dutch marine painter of the last decades of the century, for whom he later worked.  [[Abraham Storck]] was another influence on his later work, which declined sharply in quality from the 1680s.  In his last years he painted inferior replicas of his own earlier works and those of others.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;  He was buried in the Nieuwe Zuids chapel on October 20, 1707 – a recent archival discovery, before which he was often said, following [[Abraham Bredius|Bredius]], to have died, or at least vanished from view, in the late 1670s.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, MacLaren, 115&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are works in the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] (right) and [[National Maritime Museum]] in London, the [[Louvre]] and many other collections.

[[File:Indonesian funeral shroud or hanging, (porilonjong), Central Sulawesi (Celebes), Rongkong, Toraja, cotton with ikat paterns.jpg|thumb|[[Torajan]] ikat funeral shroud, [[Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]]]]
'''Ikat''' is a dyeing technique used to pattern textiles that employs [[resist dyeing]] on the yarns prior to dyeing and weaving the fabric.

In ikat the resist is formed by binding individual yarns or bundles of yarns with a tight wrapping applied in the desired pattern (''ikat'' means "to bind" in the Indonesian language). The yarns are then dyed. The bindings may then be altered to create a new pattern and the yarns dyed again with another colour. This process may be repeated multiple times to produce elaborate, multicolored patterns. When the dyeing is finished all the bindings are removed and the yarns are woven into cloth. In other resist-dyeing techniques such as [[tie-dye]] and [[batik]] the resist is applied to the woven cloth, whereas in ikat the resist is applied to the yarns before they are woven into cloth. Because the surface design is created in the yarns rather than on the finished cloth, in ikat both fabric faces are patterned.

A characteristic of ikat textiles is an apparent "blurriness" to the design. The blurriness is a result of the extreme difficulty the weaver has lining up the dyed yarns so that the pattern comes out perfectly in the finished cloth. The blurriness can be reduced by using finer yarns or by the skill of the craftsperson. Ikats with little blurriness, multiple colours and complicated patterns are more difficult to create and therefore often more expensive. However, the blurriness that is so characteristic of ikat is often prized by textile collectors.

Ikat is produced in many traditional textile centres around the world, from India to Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Japan (where it is called [[kasuri]]), Africa and Latin America. Double ikats—in which both the [[Warp_and_weft | warp and weft]] yarns are tied and dyed before being woven into a single textile—are relatively rare because of the intensive skilled labour required to produce them. They are produced in [[Okinawa]] islands of Japan, the village of [[Tenganan]] in [[Indonesia]], and the villages of [[Puttapaka Saree|Puttapaka]]&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/12/19/stories/2008121953352000.htm|title=Weaving a Puttapaka tradition - The Hindu|publisher=hindu.com|accessdate=30 August 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304180204/http://www.hindu.com/2008/12/19/stories/2008121953352000.htm|archivedate=4 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bhoodan Pochampally]] in Telangana in India.

==Types==
[[File:Gujarat patola.jpg|thumb|Detail of a classic Gujarati ''patola'' of double ikat from the early 19th century. [[LACMA]] textile collections.]]
In '''warp ikat''' it is only the warp yarns that are dyed using the ikat technique. The weft yarns are dyed a solid colour. The ikat pattern is clearly visible in the warp yarns wound onto the loom even before the weft is woven in. Warp ikat is, amongst others, produced in Indonesia; more specifically in [[Kalimantan]], [[Sulawesi]], and [[Sumatra]] by respectively the [[Dayak people|Dayaks]], [[Torajan]]s and [[Batak]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bali by Michael Möbius, Annette Ster&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''weft ikat''' it is the weaving or weft yarn that carries the dyed patterns.  Therefore, the pattern only appears as the weaving proceeds.  Weft ikats are much slower to weave than warp ikat because the weft yarns must be carefully adjusted after each passing of the shuttle to maintain the clarity of the design.

'''Double Ikat''' is a technique in which both warp and the weft are resist-dyed prior to weaving.  Obviously it is the most difficult to make and the most expensive. Double ikat is only produced in three countries: [[India]], [[Japan]] and [[Indonesia]]. The double ikat made in [[Patan, Gujarat]] in India is the most complicated.  Called "patola," it is made using fine [[silk]] yarns and many colours.  It may be patterned with a small motif that is repeated many times across the length of a six-meter sari.  Sometimes the Patan double ikat is pictorial with no repeats across its length.  That is, each small design element in each colour was individually tied in the warp and weft yarns.  It's an extraordinary achievement in the textile arts.  These much sought after textiles were traded by the Dutch East Indies company for exclusive spice trading rights with the sultanates of Indonesia.  The double ikat woven in the small [[Bali Aga]] village, [[Tenganan]] in east Bali&lt;ref name="Balinese Textiles p.117"&gt;Balinese Textiles; Brigitta Hauser-Schaublin, Marie-Louise Nabhollz-kartaschoff, Urs Ramseyer. British Museum Press. {{ISBN|0-7141-2505-9}} p.117&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Indonesia]] reflects the influence of these prized textiles.  Some of the Tenganan double ikat motifs are taken directly from the patola tradition.  In India double ikat is also woven in Puttapaka, [[Nalgonda District]] and is called ''[[Puttapaka Saree]].''&lt;ref name="aponline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aponline.gov.in/quick%20links/hist-cult/arts_ikat.html|title=APonline - History and Culture-Arts and Crafts - Ikat|publisher=aponline.gov.in|accessdate=30 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119164655/http://www.aponline.gov.in/Quick%20links/HIST-CULT/arts_ikat.html|archivedate=19 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Japan, double ikat is woven in the Okinawa islands where it is called ''tate-yoko gasuri''.&lt;ref name="Tomito J p.7"&gt;Tomito J &amp; N.

'''Pasapalli Ikat''' is one of the Ikkat saree and Pasapalli ikat saree made in Odisha. The word Pasapalli comes from 'Pasa' which means a board game with four clear parts (much like Ludo). Each pasapalli ikat saree or material - which is made with the same technique as the Sambalpuri Ikat - has some or the other form of this chequered design. &lt;ref&gt;''{{cite web|url=https://www.saree.com/about-ikkat-sarees|title=About Pasapalli Ikat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Ikat'' is an [[Indonesian language]] word, which depending on context, can be the [[noun]]s: [[cord (sewing)|cord]], [[yarn|thread]], [[knot]] and the finished ''ikat'' fabric as well as the [[verb]]s "to tie" or "to bind". It has a direct etymological relation to [[Javanese language]] of the same word. Thus, the name of the finished ''ikat'' woven fabric originates from the ''tali'' (threads, ropes) being ''ikat'' (tied, bound, knotted) before they are being put in ''celupan'' (dyed by way of dipping), then ''berjalin'' (woven, intertwined) resulting in a ''berjalin ikat''- reduced to ''ikat''.

The introduction of the term ''ikat'' into European language is attributed to Rouffaer.&lt;ref&gt;Umesh Charan Patnaik, Aswini Kumar Mishra, 1997. ''Handloom industry in action''. 1997. pp38. G. K. Ghosh, Shukla Ghosh, 2000. ''Ikat textiles of India''. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ikat'' is now a generic English loanword used to describe the process and the cloth itself regardless of where the fabric was produced or how it is patterned.

In Indonesian the plural of ''ikat'' remains ''ikat''. However, in English a suffix plural 's' is commonly added, as in ''ikats.''  This is true in other some other languages. All are correct.

==Distribution==

Children often wore small versions of adult clothing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imj.org.il/exhibitions/2014/dresscodes/en/child.html "Dress Codes: Revealing the Jewish Wardrobe"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703023916/http://www.imj.org.il/exhibitions/2014/dresscodes/en/child.html |date=3 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Ikat is a weaving style common to many world cultures. It is probably one of the oldest forms of textile decoration. However, it is most prevalent in Indonesia, India and Japan. In [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], ''ikat'' is still common in [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Mexico]].

In the 19th century, the [[Silk Road]] desert oases of [[Bukhara]], [[Samarkand]], [[Hotan]] and [[Kashgar]] (in what is now [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Xinjiang]] in [[Central Asia]]) were famous for their fine silk Uzbek/Uyghur ikat.

India, Japan, Indonesia and many other [[Southeast Asia]]n nations including [[Cambodia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Philippines]] and [[Thailand]] have weaving cultures with long histories of ikat production.

Double ikat weaving is still found in India, Japan and Indonesia. In Indonesia, it is still woven in [[Bali]], [[Java]], [[Kalimantan]] or [[Borneo]] and [[Sumatra]].
Another country that has been weaving Ikat is Iran.
The name of this technique in yazd is Daraee.Daraee means wealth,the reason of this naming is that in wedding ceremonies, There were these fabrics in the bride’s dowry, and the people who had bought these fabrics were rich.

==History==

As textiles do not last well through history, scholars have so far been unable to determine where the technique of ikat originated. Nevertheless, some parts of Asia demonstrates strong ikat traditions which suggest its possible origin; they are [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name="Love2know"&gt;{{cite web | title = Ikat | author = Ruth Barnes | work = Love to Know | url = http://fashion-history.lovetoknow.com/fabrics-fibers/ikat | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161114231155/http://fashion-history.lovetoknow.com/fabrics-fibers/ikat | archivedate = 14 November 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it probably developed in several different locations independently, since ikat was known to be produced in several [[pre-Columbian]] Central and South American cultures.

The term "ikat" has [[Languages of Indonesia|Indonesian]] origin, and it was introduced into European textile vocabulary back in early 20th century, when the Dutch scholars begin to study the rich textile traditions of [[Dutch East Indies|East Indies]] archipelago (today Indonesia).&lt;ref name="Love2know"/&gt;

[[Uyghurs]] call it atlas (in IPA [ɛtlɛs]) and use it only for woman's clothing. The historical record indicates that there were 27 types of atlas during [[Qing]] occupation. Now there are only four types of Uyghur atlas remaining: Qara-atlas (Darayi, black ikat used for older women's clothing), Khoja'e-atlas (yellow, blue, purple ikat used for married women), Qizil-atlas (red ikat used for girls) and [[Yarkant County|Yarkant]]-atlas (Khan-atlas). Yarkant-atlas has more diverse styles; during Yarkant Khanate (16th century), there ten different styles of Yarkant-atlas.&lt;ref&gt;Abdukerim Raxman, Reweydulla Hemdulla, Sherip Xushtar, ''Uyghur Örp-Adetliri'', Urumqi, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warp ikat===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}

Ikat created by [[dye]]ing the warp are simpler to make than either weft ikat or double ikat. First the yarns--[[cotton]], [[silk]], [[wool]] or other fibres—are wound onto a frame.  Then they are tied into bundles. The bundles may be covered with wax, as in [[batik]].   (However, in making batik, the craftsperson applies the resist to the finished cloth rather than to the yarns to be woven.)   The warp yarns are then wrapped tightly with thread or some other dye-resistant material to prevent unwanted dye permeation. The procedure is repeated, depending on the number of colours required to complete the design. Multiple coloration is common, requiring multiple rounds of tying and dyeing. The newly dyed and thoroughly washed bundles are wound onto the loom to produce the warp (longitudinal yarns).  Warp threads are adjusted for the desired alignment for precise motifs.

[[File:Mexican Ikat rebozo.png|left|thumb|A tricolor warp ''Ikat'' weave from [[Tenancingo, State of Mexico|Tenancingo]], [[Mexico]]]]

Some ikat traditions, such as Central Asia's, embrace a blurred aesthetic in the design. Other traditions favour a more precise and more difficult to achieve refinement in the placement of the ikat yarns.  South American and Indonesian ikat are known for a high degree of warp alignment. Weavers must adjust the warp repeatedly to maintain pattern alignment.

Patterns result from a combination of the warp dye and the [[weft]] thread colour.  Some warp ikat traditions are designed with vertical-axis symmetry or have a "mirror-image" running along their long centre line.   That is, whatever pattern or design is woven on the right is duplicated on the left in reverse order about a central warp thread group. Patterns can be created in the vertical, horizontal or diagonal.

===Weft ikat===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
[[Weft]] ikat uses resist-dyeing for the [[weft]] yarns. The movement of the weft yarns in the weaving process means precisely delineated patterns are more difficult to weave.  The weft yarn must be adjusted after each passing of the shuttle to preserve the pattern.

Nevertheless, highly skilled artisans can produce precise weft ikat. Japanese weavers produce very accurate indigo and white weft ikat with small scale motifs in cotton.  Weavers in Odisha, India have replicated fine Urdu script in weft ikat. In Thailand, weavers make silk sarongs depicting birds and complex geometrical designs in seven colour weft ikat.

In some precise weft ikat traditions (Gujarat, India), two artisans weave the cloth: one passes the shuttle and the other adjusts the way the yarn lies in the shed.

As the weft is commonly a continuous strand, aberrations or variation in coloration are cumulative. Some weft ikat traditions incorporate this affect into their aesthetic. Patterns become transformed by the weaving process into irregular and erratic designs.  Guatemalan ikat is well-noted for its beautiful "blurs."

==Double ikat==

Double ikat is created by resist-dyeing both the [[warp (weaving)|warp]] and [[weft]] prior to weaving.&lt;ref&gt;Guy, John. ''Indian Textiles in the East''. London, Thames &amp; Hudson, 2009, pp. 10, 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some sources use the term double ikat only when the warp and weft patterning overlap to form common, identical motifs.  If they do not, the result is referred to as compound ikat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dyer's Art ikat, batik, plangi|last=Larsen|first=Jack Lenor|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold|year=1976|isbn=0442246854|location=New York|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of weaving requires the most skill for precise patterns to be woven and is considered the premiere form of ikat. The amount of labour and skill required also make it the most expensive, and many poor quality cloths flood the tourist markets. Indian and Indonesian examples typify highly precise double ikat. Especially prized are the double ikats woven in silk known in India as ''patola''  (singular: ''patolu''). These are from Gujarat (Cambay).  During the colonial era, Dutch merchants used patola as prestigious trade cloths during the peak of the spice trade.&lt;ref&gt;Balinese Textiles; Brigitta Hauser-Schaublin, Marie-Louise Nabhollz-kartaschoff, Urs Ramseyer.

[[File:Sambalpuri Ikat weaving loom (Tanta) from Odisha.jpg|thumb|left|Sambalpuri double ikat weaving loom (''Tanta'') from [[Odisha]], also known as [[Orissa Ikat]].]]
In Indonesia double ikat is only woven in the [[Bali Aga]] village of [[Tenganan]]. These cloths have high spiritual significance. In Tenganan they are still worn for specific ceremonies. Outside Tenganan, [[geringsing]] are treasured as they are purported to have magical powers.&lt;ref name="Balinese Textiles p.117"/&gt;

The double ikat of Japan is woven in the Okinawa islands and is called ''tate-yoko gasuri''.&lt;ref name="Tomito J p.7"/&gt;

[[Pochampally Sari]], a variety from a small village in Nalgonda district, Andhra Pradesh, India is known for silk saris woven in the double Ikat.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The [[Puttapaka Saree]]&lt;ref name="indiaheritage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaheritage.org/creative/craft/textiles.htm|title=Textiles|publisher=indiaheritage.org|accessdate=30 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704143231/http://www.indiaheritage.org/creative/craft/textiles.htm|archivedate=4 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is made in Puttapaka village, Samsthan Narayanpuram mandal in Nalgonda district, India. It is known for its unique style of silk saris. The symmetric design is over 200 years old. The Ikat is warp-based. The Puttapaka Saree is a double ikat.

Before the weaving is done, a manual winding of yarn, called Asu, needs to be performed. This process takes up to 5 hours per sari and is usually done by the womenfolk, who suffer physical strain through constantly moving their hands back and forth over 9000 times for each sari. In 1999, a young weaver C Mallesham developed a machine which automated Asu, thus developing a technological solution for a decades-old unsolved problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/asu-machine-to-aid-weaverstiedye-sarees/341893/ Asu machine to aid weavers of tie and dye sarees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011174029/http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/asu-machine-to-aid-weaverstiedye-sarees/341893/ |date=11 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oshima===
Oshima ikat is a uniquely Japanese ikat. In Oshima, the warp and weft threads are both used as warp to weave stiff fabric, upon which the thread for the ikat weaving is spot-dyed. Then the mats are unravelled and the dyed thread is woven into oshima cloth.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The Oshima process is duplicated in Java and Bali, and is reserved for ruling royalty, notably ''Klungkung'' and ''Ubud'': most especially the ''dodot'' cloth semi-[[cummerbund]] of Javanese court attire.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Other countries==
[[File:Ikat 2006.10.jpg|thumb|Ikat ''abr'', silk and cotton, mid-19th century, [[Uzbekistan]]. [[Smithsonian]] collections.]]
===Cambodia===
The [[Cambodia]]n ikat is a weft ikat woven of silk on a multi-shaft loom with an uneven [[twill]] weave, which results in the weft threads showing more prominently on the front of the fabric than the back.&lt;ref&gt;[Mattiebelle Gittinger and H. Leedom Lefforts,''Textiles and the Thai Experience in South-East Asia'', Washington, DC 1992, PP38–39]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gill Green,"The Cambodia Weaving Tradition: Little Known Weaving and Loom Artifacts,"''Arts of Asia'', vold.27, no. 5, Hong Kong, 199, pp.&amp;nbsp;86–87&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, Cambodian ikat was considered among the finest textiles of the world. When the King of Thailand came to the US in 1856, he brought as a gift for President [[Franklin Pierce]] fine Cambodian ikat cloth.&lt;ref&gt;''Gettinger, op.cit., pp 149. 167''&lt;/ref&gt; The most intricately patterned of the Cambodian fabrics are the ''sampot hol''—skirts worn by the women—and the ''pidans''—wall hangings used to decorate the pagoda or the home for special ceremonies.

Unfortunately, Cambodian culture suffered massive disruption and destruction during the mid-20th century Indochina wars but most especially during the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime. Most weavers were killed and the whole art of Cambodian ikat was in danger of disappearing.

[[Kikuo Morimoto]] is a prominent pioneer in re-introducing ikat to Cambodia. In 1995, he moved from Japan and located one or two elderly weavers and Khmer Rouge survivors who knew the art and have taught it to a new generation.

===Thailand===

In Thailand, the local weft ikat type of woven cloth is known as '''Matmi''' (also spelled 'Mudmee' or 'Mudmi').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surin.go.th/web_eng/web_eng/silk.htm Silk at Ban Sawai] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719102131/http://www.surin.go.th/web_eng/web_eng/silk.htm |date=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Traditional Mudmi cloth was woven for daily use among the nobility. Other uses included ceremonial costumes. Warp ikat in cotton is also produced by the Karen and Lawa tribal peoples in northern Thailand.

This type of cloth is the favourite silk item woven by ethnic [[Khmer people|Khmer]] people living in southern [[Isaan]], mainly in [[Surin Province|Surin]], [[Sisaket Province|Sisaket]] and [[Buriram Province|Buriram]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://icmr.cru.in.th/journal/133255110254.pdf Chusak Sukaranandana - ''Woven cloth, an exquisite handicraft of Thai-Lao-Khmer ethnic groups in Thailand''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818070110/http://icmr.cru.in.th/journal/133255110254.pdf |date=18 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
In Iran, Ikat  which is called Darayee has  been carried out in different areas and now in Yazd there are  some workshops to produce it. it is  said that  this kind of cloth has been used in the dowry, as a bride's property in the old days. in  popular belief, there is a quote that people who bought this type of cloth were wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;http://donya-e-eqtesad.com/بخش-بیشتر-26/472405-دارایی-بافته-ای-از-ابریشم-رنگ {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208045845/http://donya-e-eqtesad.com/%D8%A8%D8%AE%D8%B4-%D8%A8%DB%8C%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%B1-26/472405-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%87-%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B4%D9%85-%D8%B1%D9%86%DA%AF |date=8 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ikat patterns are common among the [[Andes]] peoples, and native people of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]], and [[Venezuela]]. The [[Mapuche]] shawl or poncho of the [[Huaso]] cowboys of Chile is perhaps the item best known in the West. Wool and ''[[Fique|cabuya]]'' fibre are the most commonly used. 

The Mexican [[rebozo]]s can be made from silk, wool or cotton and are frequently ikat dyed. These shawls are seen as a part of the Mexican national identity and most women own at least one.

Latin American ''ikat'' (Jaspe, as it is known to [[Maya people|Maya]] weavers) textiles are commonly woven on a back-strap [[loom]]. Pre-dyed [[warp (weaving)|warp]] threads are a common item in traditional markets- saving the weaver much mess, expense, time and labour.&lt;ref name=Waddington&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Waddingtons|Waddington]] | url=http://backstrapweaving.wordpress.com/2010/03/05/backstrap-weaving-cross-knit-looping-tutorial-and-ikathttp://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/asia/Ikat/index.html | title=South American Ikat | work=South America | accessdate= 3 May 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Latin American innovation which may also be employed elsewhere is to employ a round stick around which warp threads are wrapped in groups, thus allowing more precise control of the desired design.&lt;ref name=Waddington/&gt; The "corte" is the typical wrap skirt used worn by Guatemalan women.

==Accreditation==
As of 2010, the government of the Republic of Indonesia announced it would pursue UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage accreditation for its ikat weaving, along with ''songket'', and [[gamelan]] having successfully attained this UNESCO recognition for its [[wayang]], [[batik]] and the [[keris|kris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher= [[Antara News Indonesia]] | url= http://www.antaranews.com/berita/1265353577/batik-wayang-keris-jadi-warisan-budaya-dunia | title= ''Batik, Wayang, Keris: Jadi Warisan Budaya Dunia'' | work= Indonesian | accessdate= 3 May 2010 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100523121325/http://www.antaranews.com/berita/1265353577/batik-wayang-keris-jadi-warisan-budaya-dunia | archivedate= 23 May 2010 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting '''''Independence or Death''''' ('''''Independência ou Morte''''' in Portuguese), also known as the '''''Cry of Ipiranga''''' ('''''Grito do Ipiranga''''' in the original), is the main artwork representing the [[Cry of Ipiranga#Declaration of Independence|proclamation]] of [[Brazilian independence]].&lt;ref name="uol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pessoas.hsw.uol.com.br/ipiranga.htm|title=O grito do Ipiranga aconteceu como no quadro?|author=|date=|publisher=uol.com.br|accessdate=November 2, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004115025/http://pessoas.hsw.uol.com.br/ipiranga.htm|archivedate=October 4, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Olhares sobre o Museu do Ipiranga 2017 021.jpg|thumb|right|Representation of the painting on the [[Monument to the Independence of Brazil]].]]
The artist [[Pedro Américo]] finished the painting in 1888 in [[Florence]], Italy, 66 years after the proclamation of independence. The [[House of Braganza| Brazilian imperial house]] commissioned the work, due to investments into the construction of the Museu do Ipiranga (presently the [[Museu Paulista]]&lt;ref name=museudacidade&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museudacidade.sp.gov.br/grito-quadro.php|accessdate=November 13, 2013|title=Quadro de Pedro Américo de Figueiredo "Independência ou Morte"}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The goal of the artwork was to emphasize the monarchy.&lt;ref name="uol" /&gt;

=== Controversy ===

There exists evidence that the painting is not an accurate description of the events on the shores of the [[Ipiranga Brook]].&lt;ref name="uol" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3070">'''Information Doesn’t Want to Be Free''' is a 2014 non-fiction book by science fiction writer and Internet activist [[Cory Doctorow]]. In the book, he advocates for less restrictions on intellectual property on the Internet. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2014/12/02/book-review-information-doesn-want-free-laws-for-internet-age-cory-doctorow/ULbyUMQCjiK3Xp0SwFuRZO/story.html |title=Book Review: Information Doesn't Want to be Free by Cory Doctorow |last=Sullivan |first=James |date=2 December 2014 |website=www.bostonglobe.com|publisher=Boston Globe |access-date=27 May 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;He states that "[i]nformation doesn’t want to be free,...people do.” &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2014/12/02/book-review-information-doesn-want-free-laws-for-internet-age-cory-doctorow/ULbyUMQCjiK3Xp0SwFuRZO/story.html |title=Book Review: Information Doesn't Want to be Free by Cory Doctorow |last=Sullivan |first=James |date=2 December 2014 |website=www.bostonglobe.com|publisher=Boston Globe |access-date=27 May 2017 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

Doctorow disagrees with claims by creators and creative industry representatives that downloading and streaming of content online (e.g., songs) is hurting creators and creative industries. Doctorow argues that a "free and open digital culture" provides a net benefit to society. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2014/12/02/book-review-information-doesn-want-free-laws-for-internet-age-cory-doctorow/ULbyUMQCjiK3Xp0SwFuRZO/story.html |title=Book Review: Information Doesn't Want to be Free by Cory Doctorow |last=Sullivan |first=James |date=2 December 2014 |website=www.bostonglobe.com|publisher=Boston Globe |access-date=27 May 2017 |quote=}}  &lt;/ref&gt; Movie and music industries have tried to stop online pirated sharing of their content. Similarly, book authors have tried to prevent their texts from being made available on the Internet. 

Doctorow argues that an open Internet is like a musician or street performer [[busking]] on the street. If people passing by enjoy the performance, they put money in the hat. Yes, some people will listen and then leave without putting money in the hat. But enough fans will put money in the hat. Doctorow claims that this analogy will work on the Internet. He says that just because the Internet and computers make it easy to copy and post content online, this doesn't mean that users will pirate content. Doctorow says digital locks on content do not reduce piracy; he argues that digital locks provoke piracy.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2014/12/02/book-review-information-doesn-want-free-laws-for-internet-age-cory-doctorow/ULbyUMQCjiK3Xp0SwFuRZO/story.html |title=Book Review: Information Doesn't Want to be Free by Cory Doctorow |last=Sullivan |first=James |date=2 December 2014 |website=www.bostonglobe.com|publisher=Boston Globe |access-date=27 May 2017 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jolie laide''' (English translation: "beautiful ugly") is the French expression used to describe someone who is unconventionally beautiful. Snaggle teeth, a bump in the nose, closely set eyes are just a few examples of unconventional physical traits, which some might view as deformities, that are embraced under the notion of jolie laide. Although the concept of jolie laide recognizes that ''men act and women appear'' (as the writer John Berger once put it), it also recognizes that behind the visceral image lies an internal life.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Merkin|first=Daphne|title=The Unfairest of Them All|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/style/tmagazine/t_b_2122_talk_jolie_laide_.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher=New York Times|date=16 October 2005|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the literary critic Daphne Merkin put it, jolie laide is "a triumph of personality over physiognomy, the imposition of substance over surface."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; 

It is unclear when and where the term arose in French culture. Some have surmised that the term comes out of Serge Gainsbourg's song "Laide Jolie Laide."&lt;ref name="Ollivier 272"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ollivier|first=Debra|title=What French Women Know: About Love, Sex, and Other Matters of the Heart and Mind|year=2010|publisher=Berkley Trade|location=USA|isbn=042523648X|pages=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Celebrities commonly thought to encapsulate this notion include: [[Anjelica Huston]] whose "regal asymmetry defies the norms of magazine 'pretty'";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ollivier|first=Debra|title=What French Women Know: About Love, Sex, and Other Matters of the Heart and Mind|year=2010|publisher=Berkley Trade|location=USA|isbn=042523648X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sofia Coppola]] with her "introspective, girl-in-a-Vermeer-painting aura rather than the paint-by-numbers cheerleader vibe of Lindsay Lohan.";&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]] with her "melancholic air and the vaguely awkward way she inhabits her lanky body".&lt;ref name="Ollivier 272" /&gt; The late [[Isabella Blow]] has also been described by this term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/34732/?ref=fashion|title=The Sad Hatter|last=Larocca|first=Amy|date=15 May 2007|publisher=''New York Magazine''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Folio from a Koran (8th-9th century).jpg|300px|thumbnail|Kufic script, 8th or 9th century (Surah 48: 27–28) [[Qur'an]].]]
'''Kufic''' is the oldest [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphic]] form of the various [[Arabic script]]s and consists of a modified form of the old [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean script]]. Kufic developed around the end of the 7th century in [[Kufa]], Iraq, from which it takes its name, and other centres.&lt;ref name=brmu&gt;{{cite web|title=Arabic scripts|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/museum_and_exhibition/arabic_script/arabic_scripts.aspx|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
[[File:Quran Kufic script.jpg|thumbnail|Kufic script used in a copy of the [[Qur'an]]]]
Kufic was prevalent in manuscripts from the 7th to 10th centuries.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Until about the 11th century it was the main script used to copy the Qur'an.&lt;ref name=brmu/&gt; Professional copyists employed a particular form of kufic for reproducing the earliest surviving copies of the Qur'an, which were written on parchment and date from the 8th to 10th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spirit of Islam: Experiencing Islam through Calligraphy|url=http://www.moa.ubc.ca/spiritofislam/unity/kufic.html|publisher=UBC Museum of Anthropology|accessdate=13 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021108152157/http://www.moa.ubc.ca/spiritofislam/unity/kufic.html|archivedate=8 November 2002|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ornamental use===
Kufic is commonly seen on [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] coins and monuments and on early [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] coins.  Its decorative character led to its use as a decorative element in several public and domestic buildings constructed prior to the [[History of the Republic of Turkey|Republican period]] in [[Turkey]].

The current [[flag of Iraq]] (2008) includes a kufic rendition of the [[takbir]].
Similarly, the [[flag of Iran]] (1980) has the takbir  written in white square kufic script a total of 22 times on the fringe of both the green and red bands.

Square or geometric Kufic is a very simplified rectangular style of Kufic widely used for tiling. In Iran sometimes entire buildings are covered with tiles spelling sacred names like those of God, Muhammad and Ali in square Kufic, a technique known as ''[[banna'i]]''.&lt;ref name="BloomBlair2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jonathan M. Bloom|author2=Sheila Blair|title=The Grove encyclopedia of Islamic art and architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=PA212|accessdate=4 January 2012|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|pages=101, 131, 246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Pseudo-Kufic]]", also "Kufesque",{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} refers to imitations of the Kufic script, made in a non-Arabic context, during the [[Middle Ages]] or the [[Renaissance]]: "Imitations of Arabic in European art are often described as pseudo-Kufic, borrowing the term for an Arabic script that emphasizes straight and angular strokes, and is most commonly used in Islamic architectural decoration".&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Last Hours''''' (known as '''''Rancid News''''' prior to 2005) is an anti-authoritarian publishing collective. From 2003 to 2008 it produced a fanzine, initially called ''Rancid News'' until issue 9, changing its name to ''Last Hours'' from issue 10 till the final issue, 17, in May 2008. All 17 issues were edited by [[Edd Baldry]] before he stood down as editor. Since 2008 ''Last Hours'' has become a publishing collective, launching a website, and releasing two books in the autumn of 2009, '''''Excessive Force''''' and '''''Diary of a miscreant'''''

==Rancid News==
At its inception Rancid News was a [[punk zine]], which began circulation in April 2003 with interviews from [[AFI (band)|AFI]], [[One Minute Silence (band)|One Minute Silence]], and [[Johnny Truant]], alongside articles, columns and reviews. ''Rancid News'' was initially launched at a time when the ''[[Fracture (fanzine)|Fracture]]'' and ''[[Reason To Believe (fanzine)|Reason To Believe]]'' zines were still in existence. After those publications ceased, ''Rancid News'' assumed their mantel documenting the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Punk subculture|punk]] [[wikt:scene|scene]]. A key difference between ''Rancid News'' and the aforementioned zines is that ''Rancid News'' was sold outside [[concert|gig]]s, and in record and comic stores rather than being available free. It was compared to [[San Francisco]]-based ''[[Maximum RocknRoll]]'', due largely to similar political beliefs and style of music covered.&lt;ref&gt;Boarts Larson, Christine, ''Slug and Lettuce'' #82, August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rancid News'' was often connected with the Household Name records scene, featuring most of the label's bands between 2003 and 2005. ''Rancid News'' was also distributed by many of the Household Name Records bands, including [[Five Knuckle]], [[Captain Everything!]], [[Adequate Seven]], [[Howards Alias]], and [[Antimaniax]] amongst others. At its height ''Rancid News'' distributed around 4,000 copies around the UK and Europe. The zine was printed on [[newsprint]] and most issues were 116 pages long, with a colour cover, and [[saddle stitch]] binding.

In early 2005 the name ''Rancid News'' was considered a hindrance. People mistakenly assumed the fanzine had something to do with the punk rock band [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and it was felt that it forced contributors to focus too heavily on music. The final issue of ''Rancid News'', published in February 2005, gave an indication of the changing direction, with a greater emphasis on radical culture in general and with particular focus on political articles, [[vegan]] recipes and longer columns.

The name ''Last Hours'' was agreed on in a meeting in March 2005, with the first issue - issue 10 - of the fanzine being released in June 2005, with subsequent issues to be released every six months. It maintained a balance between interviews with punk bands and political articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasthours.org.uk/about/issue10/ |title=issue 10 |publisher=Last Hours |date=2007-11-15 |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published under the strapline 'Radical culture and punk rock'.

The print production remained the same as ''Rancid News'' until issue 13, when the fanzine again changed direction with the first perfect bound edition, and an issue dedication to 'Punk rock and comics'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasthours.org.uk/about/issue13/ |title=issue 13 |publisher=Last Hours |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It marked the first time that interviews, articles or reviews relating to punk rock took up less than 50% of the fanzine.

After issue 13 each issue of Last Hours was themed in one way or another, most often around the principle article of the zine. So, issue 14 focussed on acoustic punk rock, issue 15 on [[anarcho-punk]] compilations, issue 16 on DIY punk rock houseshows, and issue 17 on radical illustration. In all of the issues of ''Last Hours'' anarchist politics and radical culture took prominence over the music.

==Last Hours live==
''Last Hours'' regularly put on gigs in London under the nomicker ''Last Hours live''. During 2006 these were most often at ''The Square'', a [[squatting|squatted]] social centre in Russel Square, where Last Hours put on, amongst others, [[The Steal]], Ghost Mice, [[Attack Vipers]] and [[The King Blues]]. During 2007 ''Last Hours'' continued to put on gigs in squatted social centres around London, including ''The Vortex'', in Stoke Newington, and ''The New Camberwell Social centre'' off Camberwell New Road, Kennington. In late 2007 ''Last Hours live'' started putting on gigs at the [[Cross Kings]], Kings Cross, to launch Last Hours issue 16, and for the first five months of 2008 had monthly gigs at the venue, including one of [[Fall of Efrafa|Fall of Efrafa's]] few London shows.

In addition to putting on gigs members of the Last Hours/ Rancid News collective have been involved in a number of squatted social centres, for example in 2003 with involvement in the Blackstar collective, 2004 with the In Arms Reach collective, which squatted a building off London's [[Oxford Street]] for a two-week punk festival, and 2005 at the Institute for Autonomy on Gower Street, London.

==London Zine Symposium==
In 2005 two members of the ''Rancid News'' collective established the London Zine Symposium, which for the first year was held in the Institute for Autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.londonzinesymposium.org.uk/archives/2005/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202555/http://www.londonzinesymposium.org.uk/archives/2005/ |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has become an annual event, and in 2009 had over 1,000 attendees with talks given by [[Roger Sabin]], [[Teal Triggs]], Barcelona Zine Library, and Alex Wrekk from Portland{{clarification|date=February 2017}}, United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.londonzinesymposium.org.uk/workshops/workshops-lzs-2009/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180610/http://www.londonzinesymposium.org.uk/workshops/workshops-lzs-2009/ |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until 2010 the event had been organised by members of the ''Rancid News'' or ''Last Hours'' collective.

==Hiatus==
After issue 17 Last Hours was placed on a brief hiatus as [[Edd Baldry]] stepped down as editor of the publication. Other members of the collective pushed for the publication to be migrated to the internet, and a regular resource for the anti-authoritarian and punk communities in the UK. The website was relaunched in early 2009 and long articles written about the protests against the attack on Gaza,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasthours.org.uk/news/a-burning-rage-analysis-and-report-of-100109-palestinian-solidarity-demonstration/ |title= A burning rage: analysis and report of 10/01/09 Palestinian solidarity demonstration |publisher=Last Hours |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; photo essays about the G20,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasthours.org.uk/articles/photos-articles-archive/april-1st-photo-overview/ |title=G20 April 1st photo overview |publisher=Last Hours |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and responses to Ian Tomlinson's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasthours.org.uk/articles/g20-another-version-of-the-truth/ |title=G20: another version of the truth – the police assault on Ian Tomlinson in context |publisher=Last Hours |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also started publishing a podcast and offering regular vegan recipes.

=="Creative resistance"==
During 2009 Last Hours changed its strapline from 'Radical culture and punk rock' to 'Creative resistance', indicating a greater focus on radical politics and a move away from punk culture. In the autumn of 2009 Last Hours released its first two books. ''''''Excessive Force'''''' was a 150-page comic's anthology against the police, with the subtitle, 'Police everywhere, justice nowhere'. It featured artwork from 17 international illustrators about abuses of power by the police. It was a benefit for [[FitWatch]] and [[LDMG]], two organisations working to curtail [[police abuses]]. ''Excessive Force'' was the first, of what will become, a regular [[comix]] anthology being produced by Last Hours. At the same time the collective was working on ''''''Diary of a miscreant'''''', a book collecting ten years of the comic zine ''[[Morgenmuffel]]'', by Isy Morgenmuffel. It offered a document on the anti-globalisation movement through the prism of an anarcha-feminist, vegan who was heavily involved in the manifestations during that period.

Last Hours, in 2010, aims to publish books about the London Zine Symposium, the squatting movement in the UK and a series of posters offering alternative perspectives on subjects such as anarchy, prisons and the general election. It will also be creating a film about the UK [[small press|small-press]] and [[fanzine]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lasthours.org.uk/blogs/last-hours-2010/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120803102844/http://www.lasthours.org.uk/blogs/last-hours-2010/ |archivedate=2012-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Latin American art''' is the combined artistic expression of South America, Central America, the Caribbean, and [[Mexican art|Mexico]], as well as Latin Americans living in other regions.

The art has roots in the many different [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous cultures]] that inhabited the Americas before European colonization in the 16th century. The indigenous cultures each developed sophisticated artistic disciplines, which were highly influenced by religious and spiritual concerns. Their work is collectively known and referred to as [[Pre-columbian art]]. The blending of Native American, African and European cultures has resulted in a unique mestizo tradition.

==Colonial period==
[[File:Warriorangel.jpg|thumb|left|''Archangel Uranus'', anonymous, [[Cuzco School]] 18th century]]
[[File:Ignacio María Barreda - Las castas mexicanas.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Single canvas depiction of the [[casta]] system of racial hierarchy in eighteenth-century Mexico, by Ignacio María Barreda. Most sets of casta paintings were individual canvases showing only one family.]]
During the colonial period, a mixture of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] traditions and European influences (mainly due to the Christian teachings of [[Franciscan]], [[Augustinian]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars) produced a very particular Christian art known as [[Indochristian art]]. In addition to [[Native American art|indigenous art]], the development of Latin American visual art was significantly influenced by Spanish, [[Portugal|Portuguese]],  and French and Dutch [[Baroque painting]]. In turn Baroque painting was often influenced by the [[Italian masters]].

The [[Cuzco School]] is viewed as the first center of European-style painting in the Americas. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Spanish art instructors taught [[Quechua people|Quechua]] artists to paint religious imagery based on classical and [[Renaissance]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museuhistoriconacional.com.br/ingles/mh-e-104.htm The "Cusquenha" Art.] Museu Histórico Nacional. (retrieved 30 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In eighteenth-century [[New Spain]], Mexican artists along with a few Spanish artists produced paintings of a system of racial hierarchy, known as [[casta]] paintings. It was almost exclusively a Mexican form however, one set was produced in Peru. In a break from religious paintings of the preceding centuries, casta paintings were a  secular art form. Only one known casta painting by a relatively unknown painter, [[Luis de Mena]], combines castas with Mexico's [[Virgin of Guadalupe]]; this being an exception. Some of Mexico's most distinguished artists painted casta works, including [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]]. Most casta paintings were on multiple canvases, with one family grouping on each. There were a handful of single canvas paintings, showing the entire racial hierarchy. The paintings show idealized family groupings, with the father being of one racial, the mother of another racial category, and their offspring being a third racial category. This genre of painting flourished for about a century, coming to an end with Mexican independence in 1821, and the abolition of legal racial categories.&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Katzew, ''Casta Painting'', New Haven: Yale University Press 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventeenth century, The Netherlands had captured the rich sugar-producing area of the Portuguese colony of Brazil (1630–1654). During that period, Dutch artist [[Albert Eckhout]] painted a number of important depictions of social types in Brazil. These depictions included images of indigenous men and women, as well as still lifes.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn Ades, "Nature, Science, and the Picturesque" in ''Art in Latin America: The Modern Era, 1820–1980'', London: South Bank Center 1989, 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific expeditions approved by the Spanish crown began exploring Spanish America where its flora and fauna were recorded. Spaniard [[José Celestino Mutis]], a medical doctor and horticulturalist and follower of Swedish scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]], led an expedition starting in 1784 to northern South America, the expedition is known as the ''Expedición Botánica de Nueva Granada''. Local artists were Ecuadorean Indians, who  produced five thousand color drawings of nature, all being published. The crown chartered expedition whose purpose was scientific recording of the natural beauty and wealth of Nature, was a departure from the long traditional religious art.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton L. Catlin, "Traveller-Reporter Artists and the Empirical tradition in Post Independence Latin American Art" in ''Art in Latin America: The Modern Era, 1820-1980'', London: South Bank Center 1989, pp. 43-45, color plate 3.2 p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important scientific expedition was that of [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and French botantist [[Aimé Bonpland]]. They traveled for five years throughout Spanish America (1799-1804), exploring and recording scientific information as well as the attire and lifestyles local populations.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander von Humboldt, ''Voyage de Humboldt et de Bonpland, Première Partie; Relation Historique: Atlas Pittoresque: 'Vues de Cordillères et monuments de peuples indigènes de l'Amérique', Paris 1810.&lt;/ref&gt;  Humboldt's work became an inspiration and template for continuing scientific work in the nineteenth century, as well as traveller reporters who recorded the scenes of everyday life.

===Historiography of colonial art and architecture===
The history of Latin American art has generally been written by those with training in art history departments. However, the concept of "visual culture" has now brought scholars trained in other disciplines to write the histories of art. As with the history of indigenous peoples, for many years there was a focus on either the pre-Columbian period (Olmec, Maya, Aztec, Inca) art production, then a leap to the twentieth century. More recently, the colonial era and the nineteenth century have developed as fields of focus. Visual culture as a field increasingly crosses disciplinary boundaries. Colonial architecture has been the subject of a number of important studies.&lt;ref&gt;George Kubler, ''Mexican Architecture of the Sixteenth Century''. 2 vols. New Haven: Yale University Press 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John McAndrew, ''The Open-Air Churches of Sixteenth-Century Mexico: Atrios, Posas, Open Chapels, and Other Studies''.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harold Wethey, ''Colonial Architecture and Sculpture in Peru''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonial art has a long tradition, especially in Mexico, with there being publications of Manuel Toussaint.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Toussaint, ''Arte colonial en México''.  Mexico: Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas, 1948. 5th edition 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there has been a boom in publications on colonial art, with some useful overviews being published in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Damian Bayon and Murrillo Marx, ''History of South American Colonial Art and Architecture''.

==Modernism==
[[File:Cristobal Rojas 01.JPG|thumb|''La Muerte de Girardot en Bárbula'', by Venezuelan painter [[Cristóbal Rojas (artist)|Cristóbal Rojas]], oil, 1883]]
[[Modernism]], a Western art movement typified by the rejection of traditional classical styles. This movement holds an ambivalent position in Latin American art. Not all countries developed modernized urban centers at the same time, so Modernism's appearance in Latin America is difficult to date. While Modernism was welcomed by some, others rejected it. Generally speaking, the countries of the [[Southern Cone]] were more open to foreign influence, while countries with a stronger indigenous presence such as Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia were resistant to European culture.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Lucie-Smith, Edward. Latin American Art of the 20th Century. London: Thames and Hudson Ltd, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

A landmark event for Modernism in the region was, the ''Semana de Arte Moderna'' or [[Modern Art Week]], a festival that took place in São Paulo, Brazil, in 1922, marking the beginning of Brazil's Modernismo movement. "[T]hough a number of individual Brazilian artists were doing modernist work before the Week, it coalesced and defined the movement and introduced it to Brazilian society at large."

==Constructivist movement==
[[File:Discovery of the Land1.jpg|left|thumb|Brazilian artist [[Candido Portinari]],Study for ''Discovery of the Land'' mural at the [[Library of Congress]], Washington, D.C.]]
In general, the artistic [[Eurocentrism]] associated with the colonial period began to fade in the early twentieth century, as Latin Americans began to acknowledge their unique identity and started to follow their own path.

From the early twentieth century onward, the art of Latin America was greatly inspired by [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} It quickly spread from Russia to Europe, and then into Latin America. [[Joaquín Torres García]] and [[Manuel Rendón]] have been credited with bringing the Constructivist Movement from Europe, to Latin America.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

After a long and successful career in Europe and the United States, Joaquín Torres-García, returned to his native Uruguay in 1934, where he heavily promoted Constructivism. Attracting a circle of experienced peers and young artists as followers in Montevideo, in 1935 he founded the Asociación de Arte Constructivo as an art center and exhibition space for his circle. The venue was closed in 1940 due to a lack of funding. In 1943, he opened the Taller Torres-García, a workshop and training center that operated until 1962.&lt;ref name="Barnitz"&gt;Barnitz, Jacqueline. ''Twentieth Century Art of Latin America''. Austin, TX: University of Texas Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Muralism==
{{See also|Mexican muralism}}
[[File:Orozco Mural Omniciencia 1925 Azulejos.jpg|thumb|[[José Clemente Orozco]], Mural ''Omniciencia'', 1925]]Muralism or Muralismo is an important artistic movement generated in Latin America. It is popularly represented by the [[Mexican muralism]] movement of [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and [[Rufino Tamayo]]. In [[Art of Chile|Chile]], [[José Venturelli]] and [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] were influential muralists. [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] championed muralism in [[Colombia]], as did Gabriel Bracho in Venezuela. In the Dominican Republic, Spanish exile [[José Vela Zanetti]] was a prolific muralist, painting over 100 murals in the country. The Ecuadorian artist [[Oswaldo Guayasamín]] (a student of Orozco), the Brazilian [[Candido Portinari]], and Bolivian [[Miguel Alandia Pantoja]] are also noteworthy. Some of the most impressive ''Muralista'' works can be found in Mexico, Colombia, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia. Mexican Muralism "enjoyed a type of prestige and influence in other countries that no other American art movement had ever experienced."&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Edward. ''Latin American Art.'' London: Phaidon Press, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-7148-3980-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Muralism, artists in Latin America found a distinctive art form that provided for political and cultural expression, often focusing on issues of social justice related to their indigenous roots.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

==''Generación de la Ruptura''==
''[[Generación de la Ruptura]],'' or "Rupture Generation," (sometimes simply known as "Ruptura") is the name given to an art movement in Mexico in 1960s in which younger artists broke away from the established national style of Muralismo. Born out of the desire of younger artists for greater freedom of style in art, this movement is marked by expressionistic and figurative styles. Mexican artist José Luis Cuevas is credited with initiating the ''Ruptura''. In 1958, Cuevas published a paper called ''La Cortina del Nopal'' ("The Cactus Curtain"), which condemned Mexican muralism as overly political, calling it "cheap journalism and harangue" rather than art.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; Representative artists include [[José Luis Cuevas]], Alberto Gironella, and Rafael Coronel.

===Nueva Presencia===
''Nueva Presencia'' ("new presence") was an artist group founded by artists Arnold Belkin and Fancisco Icaza in the early 1960s. In response to WWII atrocities such as the [[Holocaust]] and the atomic bomb, the artists of Nueva Presencia shared an anti-aesthetic rejection of contemporary trends in art and believed that the artist had a social responsibility. Their beliefs were outlined in the Nueva Presencia manifesto, which was published in the first issue of the poster review of the same name. "No one, especially the artist, has the right to be indifferent to the social order."&lt;ref name="Barnitz"/&gt; Members of the group included Francisco
Corzas (b. 1936), Emilio Ortiz (b. 1936), Leonel Góngora (b.1933), Artemio Sepúlveda (b. 1936), and José Muñoz, Francisco Corzas, and photographer Ignacio "Nacho" López.

===Otra Figuración===
&lt;!-- [[Otra Figuración]] redirects to this heading. --&gt;
''Otra Figuración'' (Other Figuration) was an Argentine artist group and commune formed in 1961, and disbanded in 1966. Members [[Rómulo Macció]], [[Ernesto Deira]], [[Jorge de la Vega]], and [[Luis Felipe Noé]] lived together and shared a studio in Buenos Aires. Artists of Otra Figuración worked in an expressionistic abstract figurative style featuring vivid colors and collage. Although Otra Figuración were contemporaries of Nueva Presencia, there was no direct contact between the two groups.&lt;ref name="Barnitz"/&gt; People who are sometimes associated with the group are [[Raquel Forner]], [[Antonio Berni]], Alberto Heredia, and [[Antonio Seguí]].

==Surrealism==
The French poet and founder of Surrealism, [[André Breton]], after visiting Mexico in 1938, proclaimed it to be "the surrealist country par excellence."&lt;ref name="Barnitz"/&gt; [[Surrealism]], an artistic movement originating in post-World War I Europe, strongly impacted the art of Latin America. This is where the mestizo culture, the legacy of European conquer over indigenous peoples, embodies contradiction, a central value of Surrealism.&lt;ref name="BaddeleyFraser"&gt;Baddeley, Oriana &amp; Fraser, Valerie. Drawing the Line: Art and Cultural Identity in Contemporary Latin America. London: Verso, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

The widely known Mexican painter [[Frida Kahlo]] painted self-portraits and depictions of traditional Mexican culture in a style that combines [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Surrealism]]. Although, Kahlo did not commend this label, once saying, "They thought I was a Surrealist, but I wasn't. I never painted dreams. I painted my own reality."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/9000295/Frida-Kahlo-Surrealist-Conflict&lt;/ref&gt; Kahlo's work commands the highest selling price of all Latin American paintings, and the second-highest for any female artist.&lt;ref&gt;Moses, Tai. [http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/11.09.95/Frieda-9545.html Saint Frida.] ''MetroActive: Books.'' 9 Nov 2005 (retrieved 18 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Other female Mexican Surrealists include [[Leonora Carrington]] (a British woman who relocated to Mexico) and [[Remedios Varo]] (a Spanish exile). Mexican artist [[Alberto Gironella]], Chilean artists [[Roberto Matta]], [[Mario Carreño Morales]], and [[Nemesio Antúnez]], Cuban artist [[Wifredo Lam]], and Argentinean artist [[Roberto Aizenberg]] have also been classified as Surrealists.

==Styles and trends==

===Figuration===
European classical art styles have made a long-lasting impression on the art of Latin America. Into the twentieth century, many Latin American artists continued to be schooled in the traditional 19th-century style, resulting in a continued emphasis on figurative work. Due to the far reach of figuration, the work often spans upon a number of different styles such as [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], [[Pop art]], [[Expressionism]], and [[Surrealism]], only naming a few. While these artists confront issues that range from the personal to the political, many have a shared interest in indigenous issues and the heritage of European cultural imperialism.

===Parody and sociopolitical critique===
[[File:Posada2.Catrina.jpeg|thumb|left|[[José Guadalupe Posada]] (Mexico) ''La Calavera Catrina'']]
Art in Latin America has often been used as a means of social and political critique. Mexican graphic artist [[José Guadalupe Posada]] drew harsh images of Mexican elites as skeletons, [[calavera]]s. This was done prior to the [[Mexican Revolution]], strongly influencing later artists, such as [[Diego Rivera]].
[[File:UsElections Obama Latuff.png|thumb|180px|'' 'McCain - Obama presidential race' '' by Brazilian cartoonist [[Carlos Latuff]]]]

A common practice among Latin American figurative artists is to parody Old Master paintings, especially those of the Spanish court produced by [[Diego Velázquez]] in the 17th century. These parodies serve a dual purpose, referring to the artistic and cultural history of Latin America, and critiquing the legacy of European cultural imperialism in Latin American nations. Two notable artists who frequently employed this technique are [[Fernando Botero]] and [[Alberto Gironella]].

Colombian figurative artist [[Fernando Botero]], whose work features unique "puffy" figures in various situations addressing themes of power, war, and social issues, has used this technique to draw parallels between current governing bodies and the Spanish monarchy. His 1967 painting ''The Presidential Family'', is an early example. The painting, echoing [[Diego Velázquez]]'s 1656 Spanish court painting ''[[Las Meninas]]'' (The Maids of Honor), contains a self-portrait of Botero standing behind a large canvas. The thick, "puffy" presidential family, decked out in fashionable finery and staring blandly out of the canvas, appear socially superior, drawing attention to social inequality.&lt;ref name="BaddeleyFraser"/&gt; According to Botero, his "puffy" figures are not meant to be satirical. He painted a powerful series of canvases, which are based on photos of torture by the U.S. military of Iraqi prisoners at [[Abu Ghraib]] prison.
&lt;!-- [[File:Abughraib.jpg|thumb|Fernando Botero, ''Abu Ghraib,'' 2005, oil on canvas. Botero painted the abuses of [[Abu Ghraib]] between 2004 and 2005 as a permanent accusation]] --&gt;.
: ''The deformation you see is the result of my involvement with painting. The monumental and, in my eyes, sensually provocative volumes stem from this. Whether they appear fat or not does not interest me. It has hardly any meaning for my painting. My concern is with formal fullness, abundance. And that is something entirely different.''&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

Mexican painter and collagist [[Alberto Gironella]], whose style mixes elements of [[Surrealism]] and [[Pop art]], also produced parodies of official Spanish court paintings. He completed dozens of versions of Velásquez's ''Queen Mariana'' from 1652. Gironella's parodies critique the Spanish rule of Mexico by incorporating subversive imagery. ‘’La Reina de los Yugos’’ or "The Queen of Yokes" (1975–81) depicts Mariana with a skirt made of upside-down ox yokes, signifying both Spanish dominance over Mexico's indigenous peoples, and those people's subversion of Spanish rule. The yokes are rendered useless by being upturned. "[Gironella's] hallmark was the use of particular Spanish Grocery cans (sardines, mussels, etc.) in his works, and soda bottle caps nailed or glued around the rim of his paintings."

==Photography==
[[File:GuerrilleroHeroico.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Guerrillero Heroico]]''&lt;br /&gt;Picture taken of [[Che Guevara]] by [[Alberto Korda]] on March 5, 1960, at the [[La Coubre explosion|''La Coubre'']] memorial service.]]

Photographers captured on film, indigenous peoples as well as distinct social types, such as the [[gaucho]]s of Argentina. A number of Latin Americans have made significant contributions to modern photography. [[Guillermo Kahlo]] photographed Mexican colonial buildings and infrastructure, such as the railway bridge at Metlac. [[Agustín Casasola]] himself took many images of the [[Mexican Revolution]], and compiled an extensive archive of Mexican photos. Other photographers include indigenous Peruvian [[Martín Chambi]], Mexican [[Graciela Iturbide]], and Cuban [[Alberto Korda]], famous for his iconic image of [[Che Guevara]]. [[Mario Testino]] is a noted fashion photographer. In addition, a number of non-Latin American photographers have focused on the area, including [[Tina Modotti]] and [[Edward Weston]] in Mexico. Guatemalan national [[María Cristina Orive]] has worked in Argentina with [[Sara Facio]]. Ecuadoran [[Hugo Cifuentes]] has garnered attention.

Previously ''Horrible Histories Cities''
Some ''Horrible Histories'' have been based around a particular city, rather than a nation or a specific time period. They also have a map when the front cover is folded out, and explain some structures in the city when the back cover is folded out. Therefore, many people consider them to be a sub-series as well. (Even though Loathsome London doesn't have these qualities, it was included into this sub-series during the republishing of the series from 2008 to 2011.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1407104233 Amazon.com: London (Horrible Histories Gruesome Gd) (9781407104232): Terry Deary: Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BO34LAAACAAJ&amp;dq=horrible+histories&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lPerTffbLo-2vQO-oomWCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwADgK ''Gruesome Guides'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nictoglobe''''' is an online art [[magazine]]. Its international contributors are working in arts related fields, such as (digital) writing, painting, poetry and [[activism]]. ''Nictoglobe'' is edited and published by A. Andreas (Andreas Maria Jacobs) who was born in the Netherlands in 1956.

== Early years ==
''Nictoglobe'' started sometime in 1982 as a stenciled paper, exclusively and privately distributed on the local night bus service in [[Amsterdam]], The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nictoglobe.com/new/2007/center.html Origins]. Retrieved November 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of these first printings are available at the [[International Institute of Social History]] (IISG) in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iisg.nl/~staatsarchief/periodieken/fanzines.php#nictoglobe IISG, Amsterdam NL]&lt;/ref&gt; The printed edition was followed up by electronic editions on [[Bulletin Board Systems]]. Later editions were put on [[MSXII]] systems, and finally on TeleText modules.

== Internet era ==
With the arrival of [[ARPAnet]] in Europe in the late 80s, new editions were placed on the Internet. New collaborations include the 'Ey Ar' shows and the founding of the Brahamian Intelligence Service in 2004.

In summer 2007, Nictoglobe organized @ De Balie - Centre for Culture and Politics, Amsterdam, using free publicly accessible open source software tools, developed and provided by de Balie, a DIY CoolMediaHotTalkShow about 'Creative Resistance, New Media as Soft Arms'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.debalie.nl/artikel.jsp?articleid=180802 De Balie - Centre for Culture and Politics, Amsterdam]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other projects ==

Nictoglobe created '''La Resocialista Internacional''' a poetical multi-lingual website which also goes under the original Dutch title: '''[http://Burgerwaanzin.nl Burgerwaanzin.nl]'''. This project gained some global attention expressed by its inclusion in new media festivals a.o File Festival São Paulo (2011), File Rio (2012), Brazil and the European Anthology of Electronic Writing, ELMCIP Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden (2012)

The '''Northern Cemetery in [[Rostov-on-Don]]''' ({{lang-ru|Северное кладбище Ростова-на-Дону}}) is a cemetery in Rostov-on-Don, Russia. The cemetery is the largest [[cemetery]] by area in the [[Western Russia|European part of Russia]] and is also one of the largest cemeteries in the whole of [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="Don News"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.donnews.ru/Kladbishcha-na-vsekh-ne-khvatit_40|title=Кладбища на всех не хватит|last=Khuzina|first=Yanina|date=3 August 2010|work=Don News|access-date=10 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The cemetery was established in 1972. It occupies an area of over 400 [[hectares]] and has more than 500,000 graves. It is quickly expanding: as of 2009, there were 355,034 graves on the area of 355 hectares. On its territory there also operates a [[crematorium]], but the majority of the relatives of the dead prefer traditional burial ritual. Northern Cemetery is also a place for Holy Protection Church and a [[chapel]], a [[columbarium]], administrative buildings and some firms that are engaged in manufacture of gravestones.&lt;ref name="Новая газета"&gt;[http://www.ng.ru/regions/2002-01-22/5_cemetery.html В "царстве мертвых" дефицит мест. Новая газета.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cemetery is constantly expanding. In summer there can be up to 50 burials a day, and that makes a serious problem as there is not much free space left. Some experts say that in future more relatives of the deceased will have to resort to cremation.&lt;ref name="Новая газета"/&gt;

At 300 meters from the south-eastern tip of the cemetery there are situated "[[Auchan]]" and "[[Leroy Merlin|Leroy-Merlin]]" [[shopping malls]]. In the south-western side of the cemetery (outside the fence) there is an illegal burial place for pets.

Luxury quarters near the entrance to the cemetery is under constant video and guards surveillance who prevent from acts of [[vandalism]] and destruction of tombs and monuments.&lt;ref name="Don News"/&gt;

Computer data base of the cemetery administration gives the possibility to search for graves that date from December 1974.

The use of flags from the [[German Third Reich]] (1933–1945) is currently subject to legal restrictions in a number of countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Banned flags of Nazi inspiration |url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/qt-z_ban.html#de |date=2001-01-12 |work=[[Flags of the World]] |publisher=FOTW.net |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=§ 86a  Verwenden von Kennzeichen verfassungswidriger Organisationen |url=http://www.lawww.de/Library/stgb/86a.htm |date=1999-01-01 |work=Allgemeiner Teil |publisher=Lawww.de |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Nazi flags make use of ''Hakenkreuz'', or [[swastika]] symbols;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Third Reich 1933-1945 (Germany) |url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/de193345.html |date=2006-08-19  |work=[[Flags of the World]] |publisher=FOTW.net |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the swastika is not always used in connection with the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] movement or of the German Third Reich or [[Wehrmacht|the combined German military]] of 1933–1945. Outside of Nazism, use of swastikas pre-dates the German Third Reich by some 3,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of the Swastika |url=http://history1900s.about.com/cs/swastika/a/swastikahistory.htm |work=20th Century History |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Symbol 15:1 |url=http://www.symbols.com/encyclopedia/15/151.html |work=Online Encyclopedia of Western Signs and Ideograms |publisher=Symbols.com |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621033916/http://www.symbols.com/encyclopedia/15/151.html |archivedate=2009-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to display certain non-Nazi swastikas even in areas where Nazi ''hakenkreuz'' swastikas are prohibited.

== Austria ==
[[Austria]] strictly prohibits the public display and/or proliferation of all insignia/symbols, emblems, uniforms (full or partial), flags, etc., clearly associated with the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP, commonly known as the Nazi Party). There are legal exceptions for works of art (including books, films, theatre performances, computer games, and educational/memorial public exhibitions, etc.), these however do not apply if the respective work promotes National Socialism (as this is generally prohibited in Austria). The law has been amended to include commonly recognized replacements or slightly modified depictions of Nazi symbols.
Violations of the Badges Act 1960 (Abzeichengesetz 1960), which prohibits the public display of Nazi symbols, are punishable by up to € 4000.- fine and up to 1 month imprisonment. However, if the violation is deemed an attempt to promote National Socialism, the Prohibition Act 1947 (Verbotsgesetz 1947) is applied, which allows for up to 10 years imprisonment.

Trading medals, uniforms or other memorabilia however isn't illegal in Austria.

== Canada ==
[[Canada]] has no legislation specifically restricting the ownership, display, purchase, import or export of Nazi flags. However, sections 318–320 of the Criminal Code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hate Provisions Summary |url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/legislation/canadian_law/federal/criminal_code/criminal_code_hate.cfm |work=Criminal Code of Canada |publisher=Media Awareness Network |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813212959/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/legislation/canadian_law/federal/criminal_code/criminal_code_hate.cfm |archivedate=2009-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted by [[Parliament of Canada|Canada's parliament]] in 1970 and based in large part on the 1965 Cohen Committee recommendations,&lt;ref name=HatePropaganda&gt;{{cite web |title=Hate Propaganda |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/856-e.htm#a.%20Present%20Law-t |date=2000-01-24 |publisher=Library of Parliament |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide law enforcement agencies with broad scope to intervene if such flags are used to communicate hatred in a public place (particularly sections 319(1), 319(2), and 319(7).&lt;ref name=HatePropaganda/&gt;

== Cyprus ==

[[Cyprus]] has no legislation designed to restrict the ownership, display, purchase, import or export of Nazi flags, nor does the Criminal Code of Cyprus expressly allow for racist or other bias motives to be taken into account when sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hate Crime Report Card - Cyprus |url=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/discrimination/pages.aspx?id=104 |work=Fighting Discrimination |publisher=Human Rights First |accessdate=2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, use of Nazi flags in a manner likely to cause discrimination, hatred, or violence may be dealt with under Cyprus' ratification of the UN [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]]. This allows for the prosecution of anyone who expresses an idea (in public, using almost any medium including flags) which insults another person's race, religion or ethnicity.&lt;ref name=cyprusletter&gt;{{cite web |author=Ministry of Justice and Public Order |title=Email to Charles Ashburner of the Flag Institute |url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NAZIFLAGS-cyprus.jpg |date=2009-09-13 |work=Modern Use of Nazi Flags |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Czech Republic==
{{Update|section|date=October 2014}}

The [[Czech Republic]] has no legislation restricting ownership, display, purchase, import or export of Nazi flags; indeed Czech legislation makes even the banning of protests involving such flags very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Czech court overturns ban on neo-Nazi march past city synagogue  |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/950384.html |date=2008-02-01 |work=News |publisher=Haaretz |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, in [[Czechoslovakia]] the criminal code was amended with w § 260 which banned propaganda of movements which restricted human rights and freedoms, citing Nazism and Communism. Later the specific mentions of these were removed citing their lack of clear legal definition. However, the law itself was recognized as constitutional.&lt;ref name=khpg&gt;[http://www.legislationline.org/documents/id/17873 "JOINT AMICUS CURIAE BRIEF FOR THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF MOLDOVA ON THE COMPATIBILITY WITH EUROPEAN STANDARDS"], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The police may cancel such events only once it becomes clear that protesters are inciting hate, which is deemed illegal in the Czech Republic. Legal regulation of hate crimes in the [[Czech Republic]] is contained in Act 140/1961 The Criminal Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Múka |first1=Ondřej |authorlink1=|last2=Krutina |first2=Miroslav |authorlink2=|last3=Rameš |first3=Filip |authorlink3=|last4=Špaček |first4=Jan |authorlink4=|title=Combating hate crime in Latvia and the Czech republic |url=http://www.helcom.cz/download/sborniky/CHV_HateCrime.pdf |format=Paper |year=2003 |publisher=Český helsinský výbor |language=English, Czech |isbn=978-80-86436-22-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (amended by Act 175/1990).

==Finland==
[[Finland]] has no specific legislation aimed at controlling ownership, display, purchase, import or export of Nazi flags, however the [[Criminal Code of Finland|Criminal Code]] (39/1889)&lt;ref name=finlex&gt;{{cite web |title=The Criminal Code of Finland (Unofficial Translation) |url=http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039.pdf |year=2004 |work=Legislation Database |publisher=FINLEX |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (especially Chapter 11 'War crimes and offences against humanity' Section 8)&lt;ref name=finlex/&gt; may be applied where an offence has been directed at a person belonging to a national, racial, ethnic or other population group due to his/her membership in such a group. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Criminal Code (39/1889) |url=http://www.legislationline.org/documents/action/popup/id/4136 |work=The Criminal Code of Finland (Excerpts) |publisher=Legislation Online |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finland also has a history of swastikas for government and military flags. Namely being the Finnish Air Force, Defense Forces and certain regiments of the army. Although the air force has phased the symbol out after World War 2, it may still be used ceremonially.{{Citation Needed|date=November 2017}}

==France==
In France, it is illegal to display Nazi flags, uniforms and insignia in public, unless for the purpose of a historical film, show, filmmaking or spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;Penal code, [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006419560&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719 article R645-1]; beware that this article is in the "regulations" part of the code (R articles) and that some editions may include only the "statutes" part (L articles).&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2000, the [[International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism]] and [[Union des étudiants juifs de France]] (the Union of French Jewish Students) brought a case against [[Yahoo!]] which objected to the auctioning of Nazi memorabilia, in France, via Yahoo!'s website on the basis that it contravened Article R645-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LICRA v.

==Germany==
{{Main|Strafgesetzbuch § 86a}} While Germany currently strictly prohibits public display of Nazi symbols, such as the ''Hakenkreuz'' swastika and the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] logo, historical and film purposes are legal.

==Hungary==

Section 335 of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code of Hungary regulates the "use of symbols of totalitarianism", including the swastika, the insignia of the SS, the [[arrow cross]], the [[hammer and sickle]], and the five-pointed [[red star]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/4602286/Criminal_Code_of_Hungary_2012|title=Criminal Code of Hungary 2012|first=xiaoping|last=qian|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israel==

The use of Nazi symbols is legal in Israel. Legislation regarding such symbols was initiated in early 2012 but no law was passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Israel moves to outlaw use of Nazi symbols  |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/11/us-israel-nazis-idUSTRE80A1O420120111 |date=2011-01-11 |work=News |publisher=reuters |accessdate=2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russia==

Russian administrative code prohibits propaganda, publish demonstration, production and dissemination of Nazi symbols and lookalikes with fines up to 100,000 [[Russian ruble|rubles]].&lt;ref&gt;http://koapkodeksrf.ru/rzd-2/gl-20/st-20-3-koap-rf&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

The public display of Nazi flags is protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which, affirmed by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case [[Texas v. Johnson]], guarantees the right to [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shuster|first1=Simon|title=How the Nazi Flags in Charlottesville Look to a German|url=http://time.com/4900385/charlottesville-nazi-kkk-swastika-germany-reaction/|accessdate=15 August 2017|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/world/article29557972.html |title=How Germany dealt with its symbols of hate |last=Schofield |first=Matthew |date=July 30, 2015 |website=mcclatchydc.com |publisher=McClatchy DC Bureau |access-date=August 18, 2017 |quote=It’s notable that when Ku Klux Klan members recently rallied in South Carolina, they carried both the battle flag and the Nazi swastika.

'''''prototype 180''''' is an artwork by [[United States|American]] [[conceptual art]]ist [[Mary Ellen Carroll]] who lives and works in [[New York City]] and [[Houston]]. ''prototype 180'' is "the centerpiece of Carroll's Innovation Territories, an initiative co-sponsored by the Rice University Building Institute.&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&amp;ID=13796"&lt;/ref&gt; ''prototype 180'' is located at 6513 Sharpsview Drive, Houston.&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.domusweb.it/en/news/prototype-180-by-mary-ellen-carroll/"&lt;/ref&gt;Houston was self-selected itself as the site of the artwork because it lacks an official land-use policy. 

The artwork "will make architecture performative."&lt;ref name="artforum1"&gt;"http://artforum.com/words/id=23335"&lt;/ref&gt; It is literally a ground-shifting exercise, because it structurally involves the rotation, back to front, of a single-family, ranch-style house and its surrounding land in the development of [[Sharpstown]], a suburb of [[Houston]], [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Texas, an Artist Plans to Rotate a House 180 Degrees |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/garden/07qna.html?_r=1 |work=The New York Times |date=October 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the rotation, the structure will be retrofitted and rehabilitated to become an occupied structure that will be become an institute for the study of considered urbanism.&lt;ref&gt;"http://artforum.com/words/id=23335"&lt;/ref&gt; In planning for 10 years, ''prototype 180'' is described as "reconsideration of monumentality that combines live performance, sculpture, architecture and technology."&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&amp;ID=14815&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rage Against the Machine''' is&lt;!-- DO NOT change the band's status from "is" to "was" until they officially confirm whether or not they are still together. An "indefinite hiatus" and a "break up" are not the same thing. --&gt; an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Los Angeles]], California. Formed in 1991, the group consists of vocalist [[Zack de la Rocha]], bassist and backing vocalist [[Tim Commerford]], guitarist [[Tom Morello]], and drummer [[Brad Wilk]]. Their songs express [[Political views and activism of Rage Against the Machine|revolutionary political views]]. As of 2010, they had sold over 16 million records worldwide.&lt;ref name="WordPress"/&gt;

Rage Against the Machine released its [[Rage Against the Machine (album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1992 to commercial and critical success, leading to a slot in the 1993 [[Lollapalooza]] festival. In 2003, the album was ranked number 368 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of the [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 greatest albums of all time]]. Their second album, ''[[Evil Empire (album)|Evil Empire]]'', was released in 1996. Their third, ''[[The Battle of Los Angeles (album)|The Battle of Los Angeles]]'', followed in 1999, and in 2003, it was ranked number 426 on the same list. During their initial nine-year run, they became one of the most popular and influential bands in music history.&lt;ref name="Devenish"/&gt; They were also ranked No.&amp;nbsp;33 on [[VH1]]'s ''100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock''. The band had a large influence on the [[nu metal]] genre which came to prominence during the second half of the 1990s.

In 2000, Rage Against the Machine released the cover album ''[[Renegades (Rage Against the Machine album)|Renegades]]'' and disbanded after growing creative differences led to de la Rocha's departure.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/1193001&lt;/ref&gt; De la Rocha started a low-key solo career, while the rest of the band formed the rock [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Audioslave]] with [[Chris Cornell]], the former [[frontman]] of [[Soundgarden]]; Audioslave recorded three albums before disbanding in 2007. The same year, Rage Against the Machine announced a reunion and performed together for the first time in seven years at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] in April 2007. Until 2011, the band continued to perform at more live venues and festivals around the world. In 2016, Morello, Commerford and Wilk formed a new band, [[Prophets of Rage]], with [[Chuck D]] and [[B-Real]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Chris Payne |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7377487/rage-against-machine-public-enemy-cypress-hill-prophets-rage |title=Rage Against the Machine, Public Enemy &amp; Cypress Hill Members Form Supergroup: Sources |publisher=Billboard |date=2016-05-18 |accessdate=2016-08-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821234101/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7377487/rage-against-machine-public-enemy-cypress-hill-prophets-rage |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Rage Against the Machine were nominated for induction into the [[Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame]] in their first year of eligibility and are nominated again for the 2018 class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/05/entertainment/rock-hall-fame-2018-nominees/index.html|title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2018 nominees announced|first=Lisa Respers France,|last=CNN|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011050359/http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/05/entertainment/rock-hall-fame-2018-nominees/index.html|archivedate=October 11, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== 1991–1992: Early years ===
[[File:Rage Against the Machine (Logo).png|alt=Typset logo|thumb|Logo from the band's first album.]]
In 1991, following the break-up of guitarist Tom Morello's former band [[Lock Up (U.S. band)|Lock Up]], former Lock Up drummer [[Jon Knox]] encouraged Tim Commerford and Zack de la Rocha to jam with Tom Morello as he was looking to start a new group. Morello soon contacted Brad Wilk, who had unsuccessfully auditioned for Lock Up. This lineup named themselves Rage Against the Machine, after a song de la Rocha had written for his former underground [[hardcore punk]] band [[Inside Out (band)|Inside Out]] (also to be the title of the unrecorded ''Inside Out'' full-length album).&lt;ref name="Myers"/&gt; [[Kent McClard]], with whom Inside Out were associated, had coined the phrase "rage against the machine" in a 1989 article in his [[zine]] ''[[No Answers]]''.&lt;ref name=McClard/&gt;

Shortly after forming, they gave their first public performance on October 23, 1991, at the Quad of [[California State University, Northridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/rage-against-the-machine/1991/the-quad-cal-state-northridge-northridge-ca-13d451c1.html |title=Rage Against the Machine Concert Setlist at The Quad, Cal State Northridge, Northridge on October 23, 1991 |website=Setlist.fm |date= |accessdate=2016-08-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921025503/http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/rage-against-the-machine/1991/the-quad-cal-state-northridge-northridge-ca-13d451c1.html |archivedate=September 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The blueprint for the group's major-label debut album, demo tape ''[[Rage Against the Machine (demo tape)|Rage Against the Machine]]'', was laid on a twelve-song self-released cassette, the cover image of which featured newspaper clippings of the stockmarket section with a single [[match]] taped to the inlay card. Not all 12 songs made it onto the final album—two were eventually included as [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]], while three others never saw an official release.&lt;ref name="Woodlief"/&gt; Several record labels expressed interest, and the band eventually signed with [[Epic Records]]. Morello said, "Epic agreed to everything we asked—and they've followed through&amp;nbsp;... We never saw a[n] [ideological] conflict as long as we maintained creative control."&lt;ref name="officialfaq"/&gt;

=== 1992–2000: Mainstream success ===
{{Listen|filename=Know Your Enemy.ogg|title="Know Your Enemy"|description=Sample of "[[Know Your Enemy (Rage Against the Machine song)|Know Your Enemy]]" from the band's eponymous debut album (1992).|format=[[Ogg]]}}
The band's debut album, ''[[Rage Against the Machine (album)|Rage Against the Machine]]'', reached [[RIAA certification|triple platinum]] status, driven by heavy radio play of the song "[[Killing in the Name]]", a heavy, driving track featuring only eight lines of lyrics. The "Fuck you" version, which contains 17 iterations of the word ''[[fuck]]'', was once accidentally played on the [[BBC Radio 1]] [[UK Singles Chart|Top 40 singles]] show on February 21, 1993.&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt; The album's cover featured [[Malcolm Browne]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning photograph of [[Thích Quảng Đức]], a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk, [[self-immolation|burning himself to death]] in [[Saigon]] in 1963 in protest of the murder of Buddhists by the U.S.-backed Prime Minister [[Ngô Đình Diệm]]'s regime. The album was produced by [[Garth Richardson]]. To promote the album, the band went on tour, playing at Lollapalooza 1993 and as support for [[Suicidal Tendencies]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-devon/plain/A730883 |title=h2g2 - Rage Against The Machine - the Band - A730883 |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=February 19, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924211523/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-devon/plain/A730883 |archivedate=September 24, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After their debut album, the band appeared on the soundtrack for the film ''[[Higher Learning]]'' with the song "[[Year of tha Boomerang]]". An early version of "[[Tire Me]]" also appeared in the movie. Subsequently, they re-recorded the song "Darkness" from their original demo for the soundtrack of ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'', while "[[No Shelter]]" appeared on the ''[[Godzilla: The Album|Godzilla]]'' soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-devon/plain/A730883 |title=h2g2 - Rage Against The Machine - the Band - A730883 |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2016-08-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820115131/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-devon/plain/A730883 |archivedate=August 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite rumors of a breakup for several years, Rage Against the Machine's second album, ''[[Evil Empire (album)|Evil Empire]]'', entered Billboard's Top 200 chart at number one in 1996, and subsequently rose to triple platinum status.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The song "[[Bulls on Parade]]" was performed on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in April 1996. Their planned two-song performance was cut to one song when the band attempted to hang inverted [[United States flag|American flag]]s from their amplifiers ("a sign of distress or great danger"),&lt;ref name="SNL"/&gt; a protest against having Republican presidential candidate [[Steve Forbes]] as guest host on the program that night.&lt;ref name="SNL"/&gt;

In 1997, the band opened for [[U2]] on their [[PopMart Tour]], for which all of Rage's profits went to support social organizations,&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; including U.N.I.T.E., Women Alive and the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista Front for National Liberation]].&lt;ref name="The State"/&gt; Rage subsequently began an abortive headlining U.S. tour with special guests [[Wu-Tang Clan]]. Police in several jurisdictions unsuccessfully attempted to have the concerts cancelled, citing amongst other reasons, the bands' "violent and anti-law enforcement philosophies".&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt; Wu-Tang Clan were eventually removed from the lineup and replaced with [[The Roots]], when Wu-Tang Clan pulled a no show during a concert at Riverport. On the Japan leg of their tour promoting ''Evil Empire'', a [[compilation album]] composed of the band's [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] recordings titled ''[[Live &amp; Rare (Rage Against the Machine album)|Live &amp; Rare]]'' was released by [[Sony Records]]. A live video, also titled ''[[Rage Against the Machine (video)|Rage Against the Machine]]'', was released later the same year.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

In 1999 Rage Against the Machine played at the infamous [[Woodstock 1999|Woodstock '99]] concert. The following release, ''[[The Battle of Los Angeles (album)|The Battle of Los Angeles]]'' also debuted at number one in 1999, selling 450,000 copies in the first week and then going [[RIAA certification|double-platinum]].&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; That same year the song "[[Wake Up (Rage Against the Machine song)|Wake Up]]" was featured on the soundtrack of the film ''[[The Matrix]]''. The track "[[Calm Like a Bomb]]" was later featured in the film's sequel, 2003's ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''. In 2000, the band planned to support the [[Beastie Boys]] on the "Rhyme and Reason" tour; however, the tour was cancelled when Beastie Boys drummer [[Mike D]] suffered a serious injury.&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"/&gt; In 2003, ''The Battle of Los Angeles'' was ranked number 426 on ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

=== 2000–2006: Break-up and subsequent projects ===
On January 26, 2000, an altercation during filming of the video for "[[Sleep Now in the Fire]]", directed by [[Michael Moore]], caused the doors of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] to be closed and the band to be escorted from the site by security&lt;ref name="greenleft"&gt;{{cite web|date=March 15, 2000 |title=Rage against Wall Street |work=[[Green Left Weekly]] ''#397'' |url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/2000/397/24186 |accessdate=October 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012080309/http://www.greenleft.org.au/2000/397/24186 |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; after band members attempted to gain entry into the exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Basham | first=David | date=January 28, 2000 | title=Rage Against the Machine Shoots New Video With Michael Moore | work=[[MTV News]] | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1433553/20000128/rage_against_the_machine.jhtml | accessdate=February 17, 2007 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313230512/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1433553/20000128/rage_against_the_machine.jhtml | archivedate=March 13, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The video shoot had attracted several hundred people, according to a representative for the city's Deputy Commissioner for Public Information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1433553/rage-against-the-machine-shoots-new-video-with-michael-moore/ |title=Rage Against The Machine Shoots New Video With Michael Moore |work=[[MTV News]] |date=January 28, 2000 |accessdate=September 28, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009193258/http://www.mtv.com/news/1433553/rage-against-the-machine-shoots-new-video-with-michael-moore/ |archivedate=October 9, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; New York City's film office does not allow weekday film shoots on Wall Street.

When the band left the steps, police officers apprehended Moore and led him away.

"About two hundred of us got through the first set of doors, but our charge was stopped when the Stock Exchange's titanium riot doors came crashing down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Devenish |first1=Colin |title=Rage Against the Machine |publisher=Macmillan |date=2001 |accessdate=September 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "For a few minutes, Rage Against the Machine was able to shut down American capitalism", Moore said. "An act that I am sure tens of thousands of downsized citizens would cheer".&lt;ref name="greenleft"/&gt;

On September 7, 2000, the band attended the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards]], and performed  "[[Testify (Rage Against the Machine song)|Testify]]". After the Best Rock Video award was given to [[Limp Bizkit]], however, Commerford climbed onto the scaffolding of the set. Commerford and his [[bodyguard]] were sentenced to a night in jail and de la Rocha reportedly left the awards after the stunt. Morello recalled that Commerford relayed his plan to the rest of the band before the show, and that both de la Rocha and Morello advised him against it immediately after Bizkit was presented the award.&lt;ref name="billboard1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/513488/mtv-vmas-top-10-crazy-moments-of-all-time |title=MTV Loves MTV: A Bad Romance |last1=Mapes |first1=Jillian |last2=Letkemann |first2=Jessica |date=September 9, 2010 |work=Billboard.com |publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=September 20, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213055039/http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/513488/mtv-vmas-top-10-crazy-moments-of-all-time |archivedate=February 13, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="limp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2010/09/03/rage-against-the-machine-2000-vmas/|title=The 2010 VMA Countdown: Rage Against The Machine Bassist Gets A Better Look At The Action|author=MTV news|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=September 3, 2010|work=MTV.com|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]|accessdate=September 20, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911220337/http://newsroom.mtv.com/2010/09/03/rage-against-the-machine-2000-vmas|archivedate=September 11, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, 2000, de la Rocha released a statement announcing his departure from the band. He said, "I feel that it is now necessary to leave Rage because our decision-making process has completely failed. It is no longer meeting the aspirations of all four of us collectively as a band, and from my perspective, has undermined our artistic and political ideal."&lt;ref name="zackquit"/&gt; "There was so much squabbling over everything", explained Morello, "and I mean ''everything''. We would even have fist fights over whether our T-shirts should be mauve or camouflaged! It was ridiculous. We were patently political, internally combustible. It was ugly for a long time".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'', May 2003, p60&lt;/ref&gt;

The band's next album, ''[[Renegades (Rage Against the Machine album)|Renegades]]'', was a collection of [[cover version|covers]] of artists as diverse as [[Devo]], [[EPMD]], [[Minor Threat]], [[Cypress Hill]], [[the MC5]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Eric B. &amp; Rakim]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[the Stooges]], and [[Bob Dylan]].&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; It achieved platinum status a month later.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The following year saw the release of another live video, ''[[The Battle of Mexico City]]'', while 2003 brought the live album ''[[Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium]]'', an edited recording of the band's final concerts on September 12 and 13, 2000, at the [[Grand Olympic Auditorium]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Bush"/&gt; It was accompanied by an expanded DVD release of the last show, which included a previously unreleased video for "[[Bombtrack (song)|Bombtrack]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Doyle |first=Patrick |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/rage-against-the-machine-blast-through-bombtrack-in-1992-premiere-20121121 |title=Rage Against the Machine Blast Through 'Bombtrack' in 1992 - Premiere |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=November 21, 2012 |accessdate=February 19, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227015605/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/rage-against-the-machine-blast-through-bombtrack-in-1992-premiere-20121121 |archivedate=December 27, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Audioslave 2005.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Wilk, Commerford, and Morello performing with [[Chris Cornell]] as [[Audioslave]] at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in 2005.]] In the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]], the controversial [[2001 Clear Channel memorandum]] contained a long list of what the memo termed "lyrically questionable" songs for the radio, uniquely listing ''all'' of Rage Against the Machine's songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Bertin  | first = Michael  | title = Imagine: The music business in a post-911 world  | work = [[The Austin Chronicle]]  | date = November 30, 2001  | url = http://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2001-11-30/83800/  | accessdate = April 17, 2011  | deadurl = no  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120622031730/http://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2001-11-30/83800/  | archivedate = June 22, 2012  | df = mdy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the group's breakup, Morello, Wilk, and Commerford decided to stay together and find a new vocalist. "There was talk for a while of us becoming [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s backing band, and even [[Macy Gray]]'s", said Morello. "We informed [[Epic Records|them]] that losing our singer was actually a blessing in disguise, and that we had bigger ambitions than being somebody's [[Session musician|hired musicians]]."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; They eventually teamed up with then-former [[Soundgarden]] singer [[Chris Cornell]] to form [[Audioslave]]. The first Audioslave single, "[[Cochise (song)|Cochise]]", was released in early November 2002, and [[Audioslave (album)|a self-titled debut album]] followed to mainly positive reviews. Compared to Rage Against the Machine, most of Audioslave's music was apolitical, although some songs touched on political issues. Their second album ''[[Out of Exile]]'' debuted at the number one position on the Billboard charts in 2005.&lt;ref name="outofexcilenumberone"/&gt; Audioslave released its third album ''[[Revelations (Audioslave album)|Revelations]]'' on September 5, 2006, but an accompanying tour did not occur as Cornell and Morello were working on solo albums. After months of inactivity and rumors of a breakup, Audioslave disbanded on February 15, 2007, after Cornell announced he was leaving the band.&lt;ref name="cornellquit"/&gt;

Morello began his own solo career in 2003, playing political acoustic [[folk music]] at [[open mike|open-mic nights]] and various clubs under the alias [[the Nightwatchman]], which he formed as an outlet for his political views while playing apolitical music with Audioslave. He first participated in [[Billy Bragg]]'s Tell Us the Truth tour&lt;ref name="Wiederhorn"/&gt; with no plans to record,&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; but later recorded a song for ''[[Songs and Artists that Inspired Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', "No One Left". In February 2007, he announced a solo album, entitled ''[[One Man Revolution]]'', which was released in April 2007.&lt;ref name="firedup"/&gt; Morello followed up his first studio album with ''The Fabled City'' which was released on September 30, 2008. During the latter days of his career as the Nightwatchman, Morello joined up with [[Boots Riley]] and formed the [[rap rock]] group [[Street Sweeper Social Club]], which released its [[Street Sweeper Social Club (album)|debut self-titled album]] in June 2009.

Meanwhile, de la Rocha had been working on a solo album collaboration with [[DJ Shadow]], [[Company Flow]], [[Roni Size]] and [[The Roots]]' [[Questlove]],&lt;ref name="zackquit"/&gt; but dropped the project in favor of working with [[Nine Inch Nails]]' [[Trent Reznor]].&lt;ref name="reznor"/&gt; Recording was completed but the album has not been released.&lt;ref name="Gargano"/&gt; A collaboration between de la Rocha and DJ Shadow, the song "March of Death" was released for free online in 2003 in protest against the imminent [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]],&lt;ref name="March of Death"/&gt; and the 2004 soundtrack ''Songs and Artists that Inspired Fahrenheit 9/11'' included one of the collaborations with Reznor, "[[We Want It All]]".&lt;ref name="reznor"/&gt; In late 2005, de la Rocha was seen singing and playing the [[jarana huasteca]] with [[Son Jarocho]] band [[Son de Madera]] on multiple occasions.&lt;ref name="Spin"/&gt; Rage Against the Machine was ranked 33rd on VH1's ''100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock'' list in 2005.

Members of the band had been offered large sums of money to reunite for concerts and tours, and had turned the offers down.&lt;ref name="MTV News"/&gt; Rumors of tension between de la Rocha and the other former band members subsequently circulated, but Commerford said that he and de la Rocha saw each other often and went [[surfing]] together, while Morello said he and de la Rocha communicated by phone, and had met up at a September 15, 2005 protest in support of the [[South Central Farm]].&lt;ref name="Rockline"/&gt;

=== 2007–2008: Reunion and tours ===
{{Main|Rage Against the Machine reunion tour}} 
Rumors that Rage Against the Machine could reunite at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] were circulating in mid-January 2007,&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; and were confirmed on January 22.&lt;ref name="Boucher"/&gt; The band was confirmed to be headlining the final day of Coachella 2007.&lt;ref name="Finn"/&gt; The reunion was described by Morello as primarily being a vehicle to voice the band's opposition to the "[[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[purgatory]]" the United States has "slid into" under the [[George W. Bush administration]] since Rage Against the Machine's dissolution.&lt;ref name="NME"/&gt; Though the performance was initially thought to be a one-off,&lt;ref name="Cohen 2007"/&gt; this turned out not to be the case.

On April 14, 2007, Morello and de la Rocha reunited onstage early to perform a brief acoustic set at a [[Coalition of Immokalee Workers]] rally in downtown Chicago. Morello described the event as "very exciting for everybody in the room, myself included".&lt;ref name="Launch Radio Networks"/&gt; This was followed by the scheduled Coachella performance on Sunday, April 29 where the band staged a much anticipated performance in front of an [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|EZLN]] backdrop to the largest crowds of the festival.&lt;ref name="reunionnme"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reunionyahoo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reunionmtv"/&gt;

Rage Against the Machine continued to tour in the United States, New Zealand, Australia, and Japan,&lt;ref name="Cecbuzz"/&gt; and also played a series of shows in Europe in Summer 2008 including [[Rock am Ring and Rock im Park]], [[Pinkpop Festival]], [[T in the Park]] in Scotland, the [[Hultsfred Festival]] in Sweden, the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]] in England and the [[Oxegen]] Festival in Ireland. The band also performed on August 2, 2008, in Chicago as one of the headliners ([[Radiohead]], [[Kanye West]] and [[Nine Inch Nails]] being the other three) for the 2008 [[Lollapalooza]] Music Festival. When asked in May 2007 if the band were planning on writing a new album, Morello replied:

{{quote|There are no plans to do that... That's a whole other ball of wax right there. Writing and recording albums is a whole different thing than getting back on the bike (laughs), you know, and playing these songs. But I think that the one thing about the Rage catalog is that to me none of it feels dated. You know, it doesn't feel at all like a nostalgia show. It feels like these are songs that were born and bred to be played now.&lt;ref name="futurealbum-bm"/&gt;}}

Morello declined to comment about the possibility of a new album when interviewed by [[MTV News]] in April 2008.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; In July 2008, it was revealed that de la Rocha had begun a new project called [[One Day as a Lion]] with drummer [[Jon Theodore]] formerly of [[The Mars Volta]], with an eponymous EP released on July 22, 2008.&lt;ref name="Tao"/&gt;

In August 2008, de la Rocha revealed his take on the possibility of new material:

{{quote|We're going to keep playing shows&amp;nbsp;– we have a couple of big ones happening in front of both conventions. As far as us recording music in the future, I don't know where we all fit with that. We've all embraced each other's projects and support them, and that's great.&lt;ref name="futurealbum"/&gt;}}

In August 2008, during the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Rage headlined the free ''Tent State Music Festival to End the War''. The band was supported by [[Flobots]], [[State Radio]], [[Jello Biafra]], and [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]].&lt;ref name="Jefferson"/&gt; Following the concert, the band, following uniformed veterans from Iraq Veterans Against the War, led the 8,000 attendees to the Denver Coliseum on a 6-mile march to Invesco Field, host of the DNC. After a 4-hour stand-off with police, Obama's campaign agreed to meet with members of Iraq Veterans Against the War and hear their demands.&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"/&gt;

In September 2008, Rage performed at the [[Target Center]] in [[Minneapolis]] during the [[Republican National Convention]]. The previous day, they attempted to play a surprise set at a free anti-RNC concert at the Minnesota Capitol in [[St. Paul]], but were prevented from doing so by the police. Instead, de la Rocha and Morello rapped and sang through a megaphone. Later that evening, Morello and Boots Reilly joined up with Billy Bragg and Jim Walsh for a three-hour jam session at Pepitos Parkway theater in south Minneapolis.

In December 2008, Tom Morello revealed that Rage Against the Machine shows in 2009 were a possibility, although plans for the band to record a new studio album were very unlikely. When asked by [[Billboard.com]] whether they planned to head to the studio in 2009, Morello stated: "we've had a wonderful year and a half of playing shows, and I don't see any reason to not play more shows. The thing is there's only so many hours in the musical day, and mine are very occupied right now".&lt;ref name="Graff"/&gt;

Morello elaborated that [[the Nightwatchman]] is now "my principal musical focus, as I see it, for the remainder of my life. From the earliest days of playing open mic nights at coffee houses, it was apparent to me that this music was as important to me as any music I've ever been involved in. It really encapsulates everything I want to do as an artist."&lt;ref name="Graff"/&gt; He repeated this point in an interview with the ''Los Angeles Times''.&lt;ref name="Martens"/&gt;

However, After the "Rage Factor" celebratory show in Finsbury Park on June 6, 2010, after the campaign to get "Killing in the Name" to the No. 1 spot on Christmas, Zack de la Rocha stated that it was a "genuine possibility". Stating that they may use the momentum from the campaign to get back into the studio and write a follow-up record to 2000s ''Renegades'' after 10 years. When talking to NME, Zack de la Rocha said: "I think it's a genuine possibility, We have to get our heads around what we’re going to do towards the end of the year and finish up on some other projects and we’ll take it from there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Slater |first=Luke |url=http://drownedinsound.com/news/4140196-new-rage-against-the-machine-record-a-possibility |title=New Rage Against The Machine record "a possibility" / Music News // Drowned In Sound |website=Drownedinsound.com |date=2010-06-07 |accessdate=2016-08-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109081949/http://drownedinsound.com/news/4140196-new-rage-against-the-machine-record-a-possibility |archivedate=November 9, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009–2015: "Killing in the Name" campaign, European tour, and L.A. Rising ===
In December 2009, a campaign was launched on Facebook by [[Jon Morter]] and his wife Tracy, in order to stop, most notably, ''The X Factor'' hits from becoming almost automatic Christmas number ones on the UK Singles Chart. It generated nationwide publicity and took the track "[[Killing in the Name]]" to the coveted [[List of UK Singles Chart Christmas number ones|Christmas number one]] slot in the [[UK Singles Chart]], which had been dominated for four consecutive years from 2005 by winners from the popular TV show ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]''.&lt;ref name="New Music Express"/&gt; Before the chart was announced on December 20, 2009, the Facebook group membership stood at over 950,000, and was acknowledged (and supported) by [[Tom Morello]],&lt;ref name="Twitter"/&gt; [[Dave Grohl]],&lt;ref name="Gigwise"/&gt; [[Paul McCartney]],&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone 2009"/&gt; [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[Fightstar]],&lt;ref name="Official Fightstar Facebook"/&gt; ''[[NME]]'', [[John Lydon]],&lt;ref name="NME"/&gt; [[Bill Bailey]],&lt;ref name="NME"/&gt; [[Lenny Henry]],&lt;ref name="NME"/&gt; [[BBC Radio 1]],&lt;ref name="YouTube"/&gt; [[Hadouken!]],&lt;ref name="Twitter 2009"/&gt; [[the Prodigy]],&lt;ref name="Chartattack"/&gt; [[Stereophonics]],&lt;ref name="Chartattack"/&gt; [[BBC Radio 5 Live]],&lt;ref name="Rage Against 5 Live"/&gt; and even the 2004 ''X Factor'' winner [[Steve Brookstein]],&lt;ref name="test"/&gt; amongst numerous others.
On the morning of December 17, Rage Against the Machine played a slightly censored version of "Killing in the Name" live on [[Radio 5 Live]], but four repeats of 'Fuck you I won't do what you tell me' were aired before the song was pulled.&lt;ref name="BBC Radio 5 Live"/&gt; During the interview before the song they reiterated their support for the campaign and their intentions to support charity with the proceeds. The campaign was ultimately successful, and "Killing in the Name" became the number-one single in the UK for Christmas 2009.&lt;ref name="The Official Charts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC news"/&gt; [[Zack de la Rocha]] spoke to BBC One upon hearing the news, stating that:
[[File:Rage Against The Machine 11.jpg|alt=The band onstage|thumb|Performing in 2010]]

The band also set a new record, achieving the biggest download sales total in a first week ever in the UK charts.&lt;ref name="BBC news"/&gt; de la Rocha also promised the band would perform a free concert in the UK sometime in 2010 to celebrate the achievement.&lt;ref name="BBC news"/&gt; True to their word, the band announced that they would be performing a free concert at Finsbury Park, London on June 6, 2010.&lt;ref name="Blabbermouth"/&gt; The concert, dubbed "The Rage Factor", gave away all the tickets by free photo registration to prevent touting over the weekend of the February 13–14, followed by an online lottery on February 17. This proved to be popular, with many users facing connection issues. The tickets were all allocated by 13:30 that same day.&lt;ref name="NME 2010"/&gt; After allowing ticket holders to vote for who they wanted to be the support acts for "The Rage Factor", it was announced that
[[Gogol Bordello]], [[Gallows (band)|Gallows]] and [[Roots Manuva]] would support Rage Against the Machine at the concert.&lt;ref name="Gigwise 2010"/&gt;

In addition to the free gig at Finsbury Park, the band headlined European festivals in June 2010 including the [[Download Festival]] at [[Donington Park]], England, [[Rock am Ring and Rock im Park]] in Germany and [[Rock in Rio]] Madrid in Spain.&lt;ref name="Download Festival 2010"/&gt;
They also performed in Ireland on June 8 and the Netherlands on June 9. Zack de la Rocha had stated that it was a definite possibility that the band would record a new album, the first time since 2000's ''Renegades''.&lt;ref name="O'Neal"/&gt; Morter confirmed this, stating the discussions he and the band had backstage before the Finsbury Park gig saying the band did write new material, but they had no motivation to release them until now. de la Rocha mentioned the very strong reaction from the [[Download Festival]] 2010 audience as an incentive for releasing new material.&lt;ref name="Rock Radio"/&gt; In addition, the band returned to Los Angeles on July 23, 2010 for their first U.S. show in two years and their first hometown show in 10 years.&lt;ref name="Soundstrike"/&gt; The concert benefited Arizona organizations that are fighting the [[SB1070]] immigration law. On the night of the show, a spokesperson announced to the crowd that ticket sales—all of which are non-profit to the bands—had raised $300,000. The band has been confirmed to do a short South American tour in October, performing at venues such as the SWU Festival in Brazil, the Maquinaria Festival in Chile, and Pepsi Music Festival in Argentina. It was the first time the band played in those countries.

During an interview with the Chilean newspaper ''[[La Tercera]]'' in October 2010, de la Rocha allegedly confirmed that a new album was in the works, with a possibility of a 2011 release. De la Rocha is reported as saying, "We are all bigger and more mature and we do not fall into the problems we faced 10 or 15 years ago. This is different and we project a lot: we are working on a new album due out next year, perhaps summer for the northern hemisphere".&lt;ref name="La Tercera"/&gt; However, in early May 2011, guitarist Tom Morello said that the band were not working on a new album, but would not rule out the possibility of future studio work. "The band is not writing songs, the band is not in the studio", Morello told ''The Pulse of Radio''. "We get along famously and we all, you know, intend to do more Rage Against the Machine stuff in the future, but beyond sort of working out a concert this year, there's nothing else on the schedule (for 2011)".&lt;ref name="Blabbermouth"/&gt; The band created its own festival, the L.A. Rising. As Morello stated, the only Rage Against the Machine appearance for 2011 was a performance on July 30 at the L.A. Rising festival with [[El Gran Silencio]], [[Immortal Technique]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Rise Against]] and [[Muse (band)|Muse]].&lt;ref name="Blabbermouth"/&gt; As of mid-2012, there are no plans for any more shows. During an interview on July 30, 2011, Commerford seemingly contradicted Morello's comments, stating that new material was being written, and specific plans for the next two years were in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vadala |first=Nick |url=http://www.mxdwn.com/2011/08/02/news/rage-against-the-machine-bassist-tim-commerford-says-new-material-in-the-works-next-two-years-planned-out/ |title=Rage Against The Machine Bassist Tim Commerford Says New Material in the Works, Next Two Years Planned Out &amp;#124; mxdwn.com News |publisher=Mxdwn.com |date=August 2, 2011 |accessdate=December 24, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915134338/http://www.mxdwn.com/2011/08/02/news/rage-against-the-machine-bassist-tim-commerford-says-new-material-in-the-works-next-two-years-planned-out/ |archivedate=September 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 16, 2015, the 2010 gig in Finsbury Park was released as a DVD and Blu-ray called ''Live at Finsbury Park''.

=== 2016–present: Prophets of Rage ===

In May 2016, the band launched a countdown website, prophetsofrage.com, with a clock counting down to June 1. Accompanying the clock was an image of a broken slash through a circle with silhouettes of five people all extending their arms and clenched fists with the hashtag "#takethepowerback" underneath the timer. This led to speculation of the return of the band later in the year. However, a source close to Rage Against the Machine told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that the Prophets of Rage website had nothing do with the announcement of a "Rage-specific reunion", but added that "some of the members" of the band have been working on a project that will include live shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/fans-expecting-imminent-rage-against-the-machine-reunion-will-be-disappointed/ |title=Fans Expecting Imminent Rage Against The Machine Reunion Will Be Disappointed |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=2016-05-18 |accessdate=2016-08-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810015517/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/fans-expecting-imminent-rage-against-the-machine-reunion-will-be-disappointed |archivedate=August 10, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was confirmed that [[Prophets of Rage]] is a new supergroup formed by Morello, Wilk and Commerford, with [[Chuck D]] of [[Public Enemy (music group)|Public Enemy]] and [[B-Real]] of [[Cypress Hill]]. The band toured through the remainder of 2016 and played the songs of the three bands in which the members of this group participated in before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Young |first=Alex |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/05/rage-against-the-machine-public-enemy-and-cypress-hill-members-form-new-supergroup/ |title=Rage Against the Machine, Public Enemy, and Cypress Hill members form new supergroup |publisher=Consequence of Sound |date=2016-05-18 |accessdate=2016-08-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823010337/http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/05/rage-against-the-machine-public-enemy-and-cypress-hill-members-form-new-supergroup/ |archivedate=August 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Morello, Wilk and Commerford's involvement in Prophets of Rage, Commerford confirmed in an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that Rage Against the Machine has not split up, explaining, "We just do things our own way. Throughout our career, we never did what anyone wanted us to do. We never made the records people wanted us to make. We never played by the rules people wanted us to play by. And here we are, 25 years later, still a band. Clearly that means something. And if we did ever play or make new music or anything, it would be a very big deal. And there's a lot of bands that I've seen come along during that 25-year period that did everything the record companies and the powers-that-be wanted them to do, and they sold millions of records. But where are they now? They're gone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theprp.com/2016/05/31/news/rage-machine-public-enemy-cypress-hill-members-unite-prophets-rage/ |title=Rage Against The Machine, Public Enemy &amp; Cypress Hill Members Unite In Prophets Of Rage &amp;#124; Theprp.com – Metal And Hardcore News Plus Reviews And More |website=Theprp.com |date=2016-05-31 |accessdate=2016-08-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910184204/http://www.theprp.com/2016/05/31/news/rage-machine-public-enemy-cypress-hill-members-unite-prophets-rage/ |archivedate=September 10, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morello added, "Right now...the cold embers of Rage Against the Machine are now the burning fire of Prophets of Rage. Where Rage Against the Machine lives, is this summer in these songs that we are playing. And we have nothing but the greatest love and honor and respect for Zack de la Rocha, the brilliant lyricist of Rage Against the Machine, who is working on his own music, which I'm sure will be fantastic—he's a great artist in his own right. But where you're going to hear Rage Against the Machine is in Prophets of Rage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theprp.com/2016/06/08/news/tom-morello-cold-embers-rage/ |title=Tom Morello: "The Cold Embers Of Rage Against The Machine Are Now The Burning Fire Of Prophets Of Rage" &amp;#124; Theprp.com – Metal And Hardcore News Plus Reviews And More |website=Theprp.com |date=2016-05-31 |accessdate=2016-08-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812171844/http://www.theprp.com/2016/06/08/news/tom-morello-cold-embers-rage/ |archivedate=August 12, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of Rage Against the Machine are well known for their [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] and [[revolutionary]] political views, and almost all of the band's songs focus on these views. Key to the band's identity, Rage Against the Machine has voiced viewpoints highly critical of the domestic and foreign policies of current and previous U.S. governments. Throughout its existence, Rage Against the Machine and its individual members participated in political protests and other activism to advocate these beliefs. The band sees its music as a vehicle for social activism; De la Rocha explained, "I'm interested in spreading those ideas through art, because music has the power to cross borders, to break military sieges and to establish real dialogue."&lt;ref name="Juice"&gt;Wooldridge, Simon (February 2000), "[http://musicfanclubs.org/rage/articles/juice00.htm Fight the Power] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201001329/http://www.musicfanclubs.org/rage/articles/juice00.htm |date=February 1, 2011 }}", ''[[Juice Magazine]]''. Retrieved October 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Morello said of [[wage slavery]] in America:

{{quote|America touts itself as the land of the free, but the number one freedom that you and I have is the freedom to enter into a subservient role in the workplace. Once you exercise this freedom you've lost all control over what you do, what is produced, and how it is produced. And in the end, the product doesn't belong to you. The only way you can avoid bosses and jobs is if you don't care about making a living. Which leads to the second freedom: the freedom to starve.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Charles M.

Would [[Noam Chomsky]] object to his works being sold at [[Barnes &amp; Noble]]? No, because that's where people buy their books. We're not interested in preaching to just the converted.

De la Rocha stated:

{{quote|Yeah, to get as many people as possible to join the political debate, to get the dialogue going. I was wondering today, why would anyone climb to the roof of the American Embassy with a banner that says "Free [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]]", why do you do that?

'''Regional Arts Commission''' or '''RAC''' is an organization located in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], United States promoting arts and culture in the region.&lt;ref name="rac-official"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://racstl.org | title=Regional Arts Commission Official Website | accessdate=23 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional Arts Commission is the largest funder of arts in the St. Louis region.&lt;ref name="rft-rac-2018"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.riverfronttimes.com/stlouis/the-regional-arts-commission-is-making-big-changes-with-a-bold-plan-to-transform-st-louis/Content?oid=24544473 | title=The Regional Arts Commission Is Making Big Changes, with a Bold Plan to Transform St. Louis | first=Paul | last=Friswold | date=19 September 2018 | accessdate=23 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RAC has awarded more than 7,000 grants totaling more than US$300 million.&lt;ref name="rft-rac-2018" /&gt;

In 2018, the commission received $6.4 million in tax money. $3.8 million were awarded through a grants process to the arts community including 125 organizations, including the largest grantee at US$413,276 for the [[St. Louis Symphony]], and the smallest grant of US$500 to an individual working the arts. Another large portion of that money is used for a program called the Community Arts Training Institute, a program to teach people how to use use arts to effect change in their community. RAC also supports local conferences, events and workshops. And the rest of the funds support operations including salaries and building costs.&lt;ref name="rft-rac-2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stlpr-rac-2018-funds"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/regional-arts-commission-awards-38-million-grants-cuts-many-groups#stream/0 | title=Regional Arts Commission awards $3.8 million in grants, but cuts many groups | author=Jeremy D. Goodwin | date=11 July 2018 | accessdate=23 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current director is [[Felicia Shaw]] since 2015. She worked previously at San Diego's Commission for Arts and Culture as a program director. She is originally from St. Louis and moved back to St. Louis in 2018 to lead RAC.

== History ==

The Regional Arts Commission was founded in 1985.&lt;ref name="rac-official-about" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stlpublicradio-rac-2018-report" /&gt;

In 2015, Felicia Shaw took over as the director from the previous one, Jill McGuire.&lt;ref name="stlpr-rac-2018-funds" /&gt;

== Criticism ==

Shaw arrived on the job in 2015, and made it a priority to improve the transparency of the granting process and make a more fair system for dispersal of funds:

:"That anyone had the impression that their tax money was locked up in a system of nepotism, whether that's true or not, was unsustainable," Shaw explains.&lt;ref name="rft-rac-2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stlpr-rac-2018-funds" /&gt;

== Evoke, The Big Reveal and Creative Vision for St. Louis ==

In 2018, RAC led a series of sessions to get feedback from the local St. Louis community, called "Evoke", or the "Evoke Sessions".

In 2018, RAC announced in press event titled, ''The Big Reveal'', the first comprehensive creative vision for St. Louis, a 90-page report and website, created through a US$250,000 study paid for from RAC's marketing budget and corporate donations.&lt;ref name="stlpublicradio-rac-2018-call" /&gt;&lt;ref name="racstl-vision-2018"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://vision.racstl.org/vision/ | title=Regional Arts Commission calls for St. Louis arts groups to tackle social ills | author=Jeremy D.

'''Robert Reece''' (2 May 1838 – 8 July 1891) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] comic playwright and librettist active in the [[Victorian era]].  He wrote many successful [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesques]], [[comic opera]]s, farces and adaptations from the French, including the English-language adaptation of the operetta ''[[Les cloches de Corneville]]'', which became the longest-running piece of [[musical theatre]] in history up to that time.  He sometimes collaborated with [[Henry Brougham Farnie]] or others.

==Early life and career==
Reece was born in the island of [[Barbados]], [[West Indies]].  His father, Robert Reece (1808–1874), was a [[barrister]] of the [[Inner Temple]].  Reece matriculated from [[Balliol College]], [[Oxford]] in 1857 and received his B.A. in 1860 and his M.A. in 1864.  He was admitted a student at the Inner Temple in 1860 but was not [[called to the bar]]. For a short time he was a medical student. Between 1861 and 1863, he was an extra clerk in the office of the ecclesiastical commissioners, and from 1864 to 1868 an extra temporary clerk to the emigration commissioners.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Reece, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1860s to the 1880s, Reece wrote comic pieces for the stage with fair success, often adapting three-act European operettas into two-act English-language pieces. He even scored a number of hits, including his adaptation of ''[[Les cloches de Corneville]]'', which ran for over 700 performances in 1878–79, the longest run in the history of [[musical theatre]] up to that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.stagebeauty.net/th-longr.html List of longest running plays in London and New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reece's first professionally produced effort was the libretto of an operetta, ''Castle Grim'', with music by G. Allen, produced at the [[Royalty Theatre]] in 1865.  Among his subsequent contributions to the same stage were the [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] ''Prometheus'' (1865),&lt;ref&gt;Printed in Lacy's ''Acting Edition of Plays'', vol. lxviii&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Lady of the Lake'' (1866),&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, vol. lxxi&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Whittington Junior and his Sensation Cat'' (1871, starring [[Fred Sullivan]] and [[Henrietta Hodson]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, vol. lxxxix&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote for the Royalty ''Dora's Device'', a comedietta (1871),&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, vol. xc&lt;/ref&gt; ''Little Robin Hood'', a burlesque (1871), revived at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] (1882),&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, vol. xci&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Paquita, or Love in a Trance'', a [[comic opera]] with music by J. A. Mallandine (1871).&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, vol. xciv&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Queen's Theatre]], he produced ''The Stranger, stranger than Ever,'' a burlesque (1868).&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, vol. lxxxii&lt;/ref&gt;  Another burlesque the same year at the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]] was ''Agamemnon and Cassandra''&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1UM5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA542&amp;lpg=RA1-PA542&amp;dq=%22robert+reece%22+benefit+play+london&amp;source=web&amp;ots=mPgy_EebRu&amp;sig=3xr-gTdElh5MxbMKRoRKFqXq9tw#PPA23,M1 A Dictionary of the Drama, ''Agamemnon and Cassandra'' described on p. 23]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
He wrote many other burlesques for the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]], the [[Olympic Theatre]] (including ''Richelieu'' in 1873 and ''Clockwork'' in 1877),&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;&lt;ref name=programmes&gt;[http://www.gilbertandsullivanonline.com/programm.htm Programme listings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420221553/http://www.gilbertandsullivanonline.com/programm.htm |date=20 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] (including ''Green Old Age'', with music by [[Frederic Clay]], in 1874; and a burlesque, ''Ruy Blas Righted''),&lt;ref name=programmes/&gt; the [[Royal Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]], and the Gaiety. At the Gaiety, he produced fourteen pieces between 1872 and 1884, among them the [[pantomime]]s ''Ali Baba'' (1872), ''Don Giovanni in Venice'' (1873), ''[[The Forty Thieves]],'' (written with [[Francis Burnand|F. C. Burnand]], [[H. J. Byron]] and [[W. S. Gilbert]]) (1878) and another version of the same story, with music by [[Meyer Lutz]] in 1880;&lt;ref&gt;"The Gaiety", ''The Times'', 25 December 1880, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and the burlesques ''Aladdin,'' (1881); ''Little Robin Hood,'' (1882); and ''[[Valentine and Orson]],'' (1882).

He collaborated with [[Henry Brougham Farnie]] on 15 libretti or adaptations and occasionally joined with other dramatic writers.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; With Farnie, for the [[Folly Theatre]] in London, he wrote ''Up the River, or the Strict Kew-Tea'' (1877);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operetta-research-center.org/main.php?task=archart&amp;cat=4&amp;sub_cat=10&amp;id=00090 Information from the Operetta Research Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727081746/http://www.operetta-research-center.org/main.php?task=archart&amp;cat=4&amp;sub_cat=10&amp;id=00090 |date=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stars and Garters'' (1878); his biggest success, ''[[Les cloches de Corneville]]'' (1878); and ''The Creole''.  For the  [[Comedy Theatre]], he wrote ''Boccaccio'', with music by [[Franz von Suppé]] (1882).&lt;ref&gt;Adams, William Davenport. ''A Dictionary of the Drama (1904) 1904 Chatto &amp; Windus, London&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote the successful burlesque, ''Carmen; or Sold for a Song'' (1879) for the Folly Theatre.  ''The Highest Bidder'' played in New York in 1887, starring [[E. H. Sothern]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1887/04/24/103141659.pdf New York Times article of 24 April 1887]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=393134 Information about ''The Highest Bidder'' from the IBDB database]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, he wrote ''Cattarina'', a comic opera with music by Frederic Clay, produced at the [[Charing Cross Theatre]], and in 1879 he wrote the comic opera ''La Petite Mademoiselle'', together with [[Henry Sambrooke Leigh]], for the [[Alhambra Theatre]].  Also for the Alhambra, in 1881 he wrote an English-language adaptation of ''Jeanne, Jeannette and Jeanneton'', a grand opera by P. Lacome after an original libretto by Clairville &amp; Delacour.&lt;ref name=programmes/&gt;

Despite all of his successful work, Reece fell on hard times in the 1880s.  He died in London at the age of 53 and was buried in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].

In film-making, a '''swing gang''' is one or more persons who make last-minute changes on a [[film set]]. This may include construction of new portions of a set the [[Director (film)|director]] requests or simply striking large [[furniture]] at a [[set decorator]]'s request. The swing gang is part of the [[Set dresser|set dressing]] department. Sets that are not part of the "permanent" sets are called swing set. They come and go as the scripts dictate. Thus the crew that handles the set dressing elements are called the swing gang. These sets may need to be struck during the late evening or the "swing shift".

'''Symphony No. 4''' in [[G major]] by [[Gustav Mahler]] was written in 1899 and 1900, though it incorporates a song originally written in 1892. The song, "Das himmlische Leben", presents a child's vision of Heaven. It is sung by a soprano in the work's fourth and final movement. Although typically described as being in the key of G major, the [[symphony]] employs a [[progressive tonality|progressive tonal scheme]] ('(b)/G—E').&lt;ref&gt;'Gustav Mahler' (Works), in ''New Grove'', Macmillan, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Mahler's first four symphonies are often referred to as the ''Wunderhorn'' symphonies because many of their themes originate in earlier songs by Mahler on texts from ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'' (''The Boy's Magic Horn''). The fourth symphony is built around a single song, "Das himmlische Leben" ("The Heavenly Life"). It is prefigured in various ways in the first three movements and sung in its entirety by a solo soprano in the fourth movement.

Mahler composed "Das himmlische Leben" as a freestanding piece in 1892. The title is Mahler's own: in the ''Wunderhorn'' collection the poem is called "Der Himmel hängt voll Geigen" (an idiomatic expression akin to "there's not a cloud in the sky"). Several years later Mahler considered using the song as the seventh and final movement of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 3]]. While motifs from "Das himmlische Leben" are found in the Symphony No. 3, Mahler eventually decided not to include it in that work and, instead, made the song the goal and source of his Symphony No. 4. This symphony thus presents a thematic fulfilment of the musical world of No. 3, which is part of the larger tetralogy of the first four symphonies, as Mahler described them to Natalie Bauer-Lechner. Early plans in which the Symphony was projected as a six-movement work included another ''Wunderhorn'' song, "Das irdische Leben" ("The Earthly Life") as a somber pendant to "Das himmlische Leben", offering a tableau of childhood starvation in juxtaposition to heavenly abundance, but Mahler later decided on a simpler structure for the score.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080611213449/http://www.andante.com/profiles/Mahler/symph4.cfm  Henry Louis de La Grange]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
A typical performance of the symphony lasts about an hour, making it one of Mahler's shorter symphonies. The performing forces are also small by Mahler's usual standard.

The movements of the symphony:
{{ordered list|list_style_type=upper-roman
|''Bedächtig, nicht eilen'' (Moderately, not rushed) – [[sonata form]]
|''In gemächlicher Bewegung, ohne Hast'' (Leisurely moving, without haste) – [[scherzo]] and trio
|''Ruhevoll, [[adagio (music)|poco adagio]]'' (Peacefully, somewhat slowly) – [[theme and variations]]
|''Sehr behaglich'' (Very comfortably) – [[strophic]]
}}
[[Concert flute|Flute]]s and [[sleigh bell]]s open the unusually{{clarify|date=September 2018}} restrained first movement (and used later with a melodic theme known commonly as the 'bell theme', which helps define sections throughout the movement) often described{{by whom|date=November 2015}} as possessing [[classical music era|classical]] poise. 
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt;  \relative c'' { \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key g \major \slashedGrace { g'8( } &lt;fis b,&gt;8-.)\p \slashedGrace { g( } &lt;fis b,&gt;-.) \slashedGrace { g( } &lt;fis b,&gt;-.) \slashedGrace { g( } &lt;fis b,&gt;-.) \slashedGrace { g( } &lt;fis b,&gt;-.) \slashedGrace { g( } &lt;fis b,&gt;-.) \slashedGrace { g( } &lt;fis b,&gt;-.) \slashedGrace { g( } &lt;fis b,&gt;-.) } &lt;/score&gt;
As would be expected for the first movement of a symphony, the first movement of Mahler's Symphony No. 4 is in [[sonata form]].

The primary theme:
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; \relative c'' { \clef treble \key g \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \partial 8*3 d8(\p\upbow^"grazioso"\&lt; e fis\!\glissando | g\pp b,16) r b4.(\downbow c32 b a b c8 d ) | dis4( e4.)\&lt; fis16\!-&gt;( e\&gt; d c b a)\! | g8.([ a16 b8. c16)] cis( d e d) \grace { c!8([ d] } c16-&gt; b c a) | g8-. } &lt;/score&gt;
The secondary theme:
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; \relative c' { \clef treble \key d \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \partial 8*1 a8\p(\downbow fis'4--) fis-- fis4.-- fis8( | g\&lt; fis g e)\!\glissando b'4(\&gt; a)\!\breathe } &lt;/score&gt;

The second movement is a [[scherzo]] that features a part for a solo [[violin]] whose strings are [[scordatura|tuned a whole tone higher]] than usual.
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; \relative c'' { \clef treble \time 3/8 \key c \minor \partial 16*3 b16\mf(\&lt; ees g\! | fis8.\p\&lt; d16 b\!\f f') | ees(\p f ees d c ees) | des( c des) f-. ees-. d-. | ees(\&gt;[ d c\!)] } &lt;/score&gt;
The violin depicts [[Death (personification)|Freund Hein]], (lit. "Friend Henry") a figure from medieval German art; Hain (or Hein) is a traditional German personification of death, invented by poet Matthias Claudius. Freund Hein is a skeleton who plays the fiddle and leads a [[Totentanz]] or "danse macabre". According to Mahler's widow, [[Alma Mahler|Alma]], Mahler took inspiration for this movement from an 1872 painting by the Swiss artist [[Arnold Bocklin]] entitled ''[[Self-Portrait with Death Playing the Fiddle|Self-Portrait with Death playing the Fiddle]]''. The scherzo represents his dance and the unusual tuning of the violin adds tension to its sound and contributes to the music's ghostly character.

The third movement is a solemn processional march cast as a set of [[variation form|variations]]. Mahler uses the theme and variation structure in a more unconventional way. This movement can be divided into five main sections: A1 – B1 – A2 – B2 – A3 – coda. The theme is presented in the first 16 bars of A1,

but the true variations do not appear until section A3, although the theme is developed slightly within the preceding sections; sections A1, A2, B1 and B2 are in [[bar form]]. This movement remains mostly in G major, but does modulate to D minor, E minor and E major; the B2 section has a rather unstable tonality, being more chromatic and moving through many keys.

The fourth movement opens with a relaxed, bucolic scene in G major.
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; \relative c' { \clef treble \key g \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \partial 4*1 \times 2/3 { d8(\pp b' g } | d'2 \slashedGrace { e8 } d2-&gt; | \slashedGrace { e8 } d2-&gt; \slashedGrace { c8 } b8.-&gt;[ a16 g8.-&gt; a16] | d,2-&gt;) } &lt;/score&gt;
A child, voiced by a soprano, presents a sunny, naive vision of Heaven and describes the feast being prepared for all the saints.
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; \relative c' { \clef treble \key g \major \autoBeamOff \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 r d8 d d4 b'8 g | d'8.[( e16 d8. e16] d8.[ e16 d8. e16] | \times 2/3 { d8[ c b]) } \times 2/3 { a[ b] g } d8.([ e16)] d8 } \addlyrics { Wir ge- nie- ßen die himm- li- schen Freu- den, } &lt;/score&gt;
The scene has its darker elements: the child makes it clear that the heavenly feast takes place at the expense of animals, including a sacrificed lamb. The child's narrative is punctuated by faster passages recapitulating the first movement. Unlike the final movement of traditional symphonies, the fourth movement of Mahler's No. 4 is essentially a song, containing verses, with interludes, a prelude and a postlude (a strophic structure). By the time the postlude is heard, there is a modulation to [[E major]] (the tonic major of the relative minor) and unusually stays in this key, ending the symphony away from the tonic of [[G major]]. Several ties to Symphony No. 3 can be heard in these passages as well.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for fairly small orchestra by Mahler's standards, consisting of the following:

;[[Woodwind instrument|Woodwinds]]
:4 [[western concert flute|flute]]s (3rd and 4th doubling [[piccolo]]s)
:3 [[oboe]]s (3rd doubling [[cor anglais]])

;''Das himmlische Leben''
;(aus ''Des Knaben Wunderhorn'')

&lt;poem&gt;
Wir genießen die himmlischen Freuden,
D'rum tun wir das Irdische meiden.
Kein weltlich' Getümmel
Hört man nicht im Himmel!
Lebt alles in sanftester Ruh'.
Wir führen ein englisches Leben,
Sind dennoch ganz lustig daneben;
Wir tanzen und springen,
Wir hüpfen und singen,
Sankt Peter im Himmel sieht zu.

Johannes das Lämmlein auslasset,
Der Metzger Herodes d'rauf passet.
Wir führen ein geduldig's,
Unschuldig's, geduldig's,
Ein liebliches Lämmlein zu Tod.
Sankt Lucas den Ochsen tät schlachten
Ohn' einig's Bedenken und Achten.
Der Wein kost' kein Heller
Im himmlischen Keller;
Die Englein, die backen das Brot.

Gut' Kräuter von allerhand Arten,
Die wachsen im himmlischen Garten,
Gut' Spargel, Fisolen
Und was wir nur wollen.
Ganze Schüsseln voll sind uns bereit!
Gut' Äpfel, gut' Birn' und gut' Trauben;
Die Gärtner, die alles erlauben.
Willst Rehbock, willst Hasen,
Auf offener Straßen
Sie laufen herbei!
Sollt' ein Fasttag etwa kommen,
Alle Fische gleich mit Freuden angeschwommen!
Dort läuft schon Sankt Peter
Mit Netz und mit Köder
Zum himmlischen Weiher hinein.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Mahler here omitted the following four lines of the original poem: 
Willst Karpfen, willst Hecht, willst Forellen,
Gut Stockfisch und frische Sardellen?
Sanct Lorenz hat müssen
Sein Leben einbüßen&lt;/ref&gt;
Sankt Martha die Köchin muß sein.

Kein' Musik ist ja nicht auf Erden,
Die unsrer verglichen kann werden.
Elftausend Jungfrauen
Zu tanzen sich trauen.
Sankt Ursula selbst dazu lacht.
Kein' Musik ist ja nicht auf Erden,
Die unsrer verglichen kann werden.
Cäcilia mit ihren Verwandten
Sind treffliche Hofmusikanten!
Die englischen Stimmen
Ermuntern die Sinnen,
Daß alles für Freuden erwacht.
&lt;/poem&gt;

;''The Heavenly Life''
;(from ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'')

&lt;poem&gt;
We enjoy heavenly pleasures
and therefore avoid the earthly stuff.
No worldly tumult
is to be heard in heaven.
All live in greatest peace.
We lead angelic lives,
yet have a merry time of it besides.
We dance and we spring,
We skip and we sing.
[[Saint Peter]] in heaven looks on.

[[John the Evangelist|John]] lets the lambkin out,
and [[Herod the Great|Herod]] the Butcher lies in wait for it.
We lead a patient,
an innocent, patient,
dear little lamb to its death.
[[Saint Luke]] slaughters the ox
without any thought or concern.
Wine doesn't cost a penny
in the heavenly cellars;
The angels bake the bread.

Good greens of every sort
grow in the heavenly vegetable patch,
good asparagus, string beans,
and whatever we want.
Whole dishfuls are set for us!
Good apples, good pears and good grapes,
and gardeners who allow everything!
If you want roebuck or hare,
on the public streets
they come running right up.
Should a fast day come along,
all the fishes at once come swimming with joy.
There goes Saint Peter running
with his net and his bait
to the heavenly pond.
Saint [[Martha of Bethany|Martha]] must be the cook.

There is just no music on earth
that can compare to ours.
Even the eleven thousand virgins
venture to dance,
and [[Saint Ursula]] herself has to laugh.
There is just no music on earth
that can compare to ours.
[[Saint Cecilia|Cecilia]] and all her relations
make excellent court musicians.
The angelic voices
gladden our senses,
so that all awaken for joy.
&lt;/poem&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4737">[[File:The Candle is Lighted - We Can Not Blow it Out - NPG mw116101.jpg|thumb|''The Candle is Lighted, We Can Not Blow it Out'', c. 1683]]
'''The Candle is Lighted, We Can Not Blow it Out''' refers to a series of engravings featuring a set of Protestant reformers seated around a candle on a table. The central figure is [[Martin Luther]], surrounded by both contemporary and historical Protestant reformers. Opposite him is a group of Catholics trying to blow the candle out. Often the first part of the text is pointing towards the bible, on which the light of the candle is shining, and the second part of the text is somewhat hidden under the puffs of breath coming from the Catholic objectors. Sometimes the candle is labelled "Evangelarium" or ''Gospels''.

Little is known of the origins of the text, but many assume the popularity of the scene in English means it was a 17th-century English invention. Luther with his bible translations and the other reformers through their questions regarding [[papal bull]]s and so forth have shed light on the bible, but they must protect it from the Catholics (the bull represents the papal bulls) who would wish to plunge it into darkness. Sometimes the text has the footnote ''[[Matthew 6]]''.

A German,&lt;ref&gt;[[:c:File:Martin Luther and Reformers OU HTFC PCF39.jpg|''Das licht ist aan den leuchter gestelt'']] from [[Hertford College, Oxford]]&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch,&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/images/59413 ''t Licht is op den kandelaer gestelt] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=35268&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=1891,0224.3&amp;page=1 1692 earthenware tin-glazed plate] in the [[British Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin&lt;ref&gt;[[:c:File:Zentralbibliothek Zürich - Effigies praecipuorum illustrium atque praestantium aliquot theologorum - 000008283 cropped.jpg|''lucerna candelabro imposita est'']] from Swiss Library in Zurich&lt;/ref&gt; inscription is known.

==Known engravings from which paintings were modelled==
In this engraving-painting pair showing 16 reformers and 6 theologians, the men sitting around the table are identified as A [[John Wycliffe]], 
B [[Jan Hus]], 
C [[Jerome of Prague]], 
D [[Ulrich Zwingli]], 
E [[Martin Luther]], 
F [[John Oecolampadius]], 
G [[Martin Bucer]], 
H [[John Calvin]],  
I [[Philip Melanchthon]], 
K [[Peter Martyr Vermigli]], 
L [[John Knox]], 
M [[Matthias Flacius]], 
N [[Heinrich Bullinger]], 
O [[Hieronymus Zanchi]], 
P [[Theodore Beza]], and
Q [[William Perkins (theologian)|William Perkins]].

File:Martin Luther and Reformers RMCC s10.jpg|''Het licht is op den kandelaar gestelt'', [[Museum Catharijneconvent]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Above the heads of the men around the table are the heads of six "protesting" theologians, heroes of the Reformation movement: [[George III, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau|Georgius Princeps Anhaldinus]], died 1553, [[Johannes Alasco]], died 1509, [[William Farel]], died 1565, [[Johannes Sleidanus]], died 1556, [[Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint-Aldegonde|Philip Mauxius]], died 1595 in St Aldegonde, and [[Franciscus Junius (the elder)|Franciscus Junius]], died 1602.

In this engraving-painting pair the same scene is depicted, but the "historical theologians" are in circular portraits and in the painting, the Dutch text has been overpainted. Both the engraving and the painting were created in the 17th-century.

'''The European Fine Art Fair''' (abbreviated: '''TEFAF''') is an annual [[art]], antiques and design fair, organized by ''The European Fine Art Foundation'' in the [[Maastrichts Expositie en Congres Centrum|MECC]] in [[Maastricht]], [[Netherlands]]. It was first held in 1988. The 10-day fair attracts about 75,000 visitors and is considered one of the world's leading art fairs.

==The fair==
Presenting 260 of the world's leading galleries from 20 countries, TEFAF Maastricht showcases some of the best works of art currently on the market  for 10 days each year. In addition to the traditional areas of Old Master Paintings and antique Works of Art, visitors can see and buy a wide variety of Classical Modern and Contemporary Art, as well as Jewellery, 20th Century Design, and Works on Paper. There were 266 dealers from twenty countries at the fair's 2015 edition, showing museum-quality pieces ranging from classical antiquity to the 21st century, valued at 4 billion euros.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tefaf.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=33#sthash.tzcqXmvy.dpuf TEFAF History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326094259/http://www.tefaf.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=33#sthash.tzcqXmvy.dpuf |date=2014-03-26 }} TEFAF Maastricht.&lt;/ref&gt; TEFAF was reviewed by the [[Global Art Magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;Scott Reyburn (March 19, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-19/tefaf-in-talks-with-sotheby-s-for-art-event-in-china.html Tefaf in Talks With Sotheby's for Art Event in China] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
TEFAF Maastricht is the offspring of two Dutch fairs launched in the mid-1970s: Pictura and De Antiquairs International. Pictura was the first international fine art fair in the Netherlands and launched in 1975. Antiqua, an antiques fair launched in 1978, became De Antiquairs International in 1982. Both fairs merged in 1985 under the banner of the Antiquairs International and Pictura Fine Art fair, held at Maastricht's Eurohal.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Harris (March 15, 2012), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tefaf:-going-Dutch-has-never-felt-better/26019 Tefaf: going Dutch has never felt better] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215140340/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tefaf:-going-Dutch-has-never-felt-better/26019 |date=2013-12-15 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 10-day event organized by dealers,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Reyburn (March 19, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-19/tefaf-in-talks-with-sotheby-s-for-art-event-in-china.html Tefaf in Talks With Sotheby's for Art Event in China] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; TEFAF Maastricht was subsequently launched at the MECC in 1988, with 89 participating dealers, the majority of them Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Harris (March 15, 2012), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tefaf:-going-Dutch-has-never-felt-better/26019 Tefaf: going Dutch has never felt better] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215140340/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tefaf:-going-Dutch-has-never-felt-better/26019 |date=2013-12-15 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It grew to rival known art centers like Paris and London and targeted wealthy collectors in Germany and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Escritt (February 5, 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-artfair-maastricht-idUSKCN0VE1WR Big name Dutch art fair follows flush collectors to New York] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the fair was founded as a fair for dealers in old masters art, more than half the participants have other specialties, including antiquities, furniture, decorative artwork from medieval times to today, rare books and jewelry. By 2014, 43% of dealers at TEFAF specialized in antiques (119 out of 274 galleries).&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Harris and Anny Shaw (March 18, 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/A-market-boom-but-only-for-some-/32074 A market boom, but only for some] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A shortage of museum-quality historic paintings and collectors' shifting tastes have resulted in an increasing emphasis on more recent material.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Reyburn (March 15, 2012), [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-03-15/calvin-klein-browses-1-dot-3-billion-fair-warhol-drag-queen-sells Calvin Klein Browses $1.3 Billion Fair, Warhol Drag Queen Sells] ''[[Businessweek]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, for the first time TEFAF launched an independent study about the size and structure of the European art and antiques market, resulting in the annual publication of the Art Market Report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tefaf.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=33#sthash.tzcqXmvy.dpuf TEFAF History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326094259/http://www.tefaf.com/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=33#sthash.tzcqXmvy.dpuf |date=2014-03-26 }} TEFAF Maastricht.&lt;/ref&gt; For years, the fair was considered "a footnote in the annual art market calendar", according to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. During the art market boom, collectors put a premium on high-profile contemporary art sales like the [[Art Basel]] fairs in Switzerland and Miami and the biannual modern and contemporary art sales of [[Christie's]] and [[Sotheby's]] in London and New York.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Crow (March 19, 2010), [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703701004575113812459542060 The Old Masters Come Roaring Back] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The fair celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2012 and is today regarded, along with Swiss modern and contemporary art fair [[Art Basel]],&lt;ref&gt;Scott Reyburn (March 12, 2012), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-14/liz-taylor-s-bracelet-gauguin-painting-boost-1-3-billion-fair.html Liz Taylor's Bracelet, Gauguin Painting Boost $1.3 Billion Fair] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; as the world's leading art fair.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Moonan (March 9, 2007), [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/09/arts/design/09anti.html Dealers and Collectors Make the Pilgrimage to Maastricht] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

TEFAF Maastricht is regarded as unequalled in its level of quality and in the methods it employs to establish and guarantee the authenticity of every painting and object on offer.

Between 1995 and 1999, TEFAF Basel was held at the Messe Basel.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Harris (March 15, 2012), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tefaf:-going-Dutch-has-never-felt-better/26019 Tefaf: going Dutch has never felt better] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215140340/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tefaf:-going-Dutch-has-never-felt-better/26019 |date=2013-12-15 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, TEFAF Maastricht considered launching a fair in New York, but could not find a site big enough to accommodate around 130 exhibitors. The [[National Building Museum]] in Washington, DC, was also mooted as a fair venue.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Harris (March 15, 2012), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tefaf:-going-Dutch-has-never-felt-better/26019 Tefaf: going Dutch has never felt better] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215140340/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tefaf:-going-Dutch-has-never-felt-better/26019 |date=2013-12-15 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, TEFAF Maastricht announced plans to hold a high-end art and antiques fair in China.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel (March 19, 2013), [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/19/european-art-fair-may-join-with-sothebys-for-chinese-sales/ European Art Fair May Join With Sotheby's for Chinese Sales] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The new event, which would have been called TEFAF Beijing 2014, was to have been a collaboration between Maastricht and [[Sotheby's]] joint venture with China's state-owned Beijing Gehua Cultural Development Group. A venture between a dealer-organized fair and an international auction house would have been unusual, emphasizing the importance of China for the West's art and antiques trade.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Reyburn (March 19, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-19/tefaf-in-talks-with-sotheby-s-for-art-event-in-china.html Tefaf in Talks With Sotheby's for Art Event in China] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the plans were abandoned shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel (December 12, 2013), [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/plan-for-art-and-antiques-fair-in-china-falls-through/ Plan for Art and Antiques Fair in China Falls Through] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Hebrew Hammer''''' is a 2003 American [[comedy film]] written and directed by Jonathan Kesselman. It stars [[Adam Goldberg]], [[Judy Greer]], [[Andy Dick]], [[Mario Van Peebles]], and [[Peter Coyote]]. The plot concerns a [[Jewish]] [[blaxploitation]] crime fighter known as the Hebrew Hammer who must save [[Hanukkah]] from the evil son of [[Santa Claus]], who wants to destroy Hanukkah and [[Kwanzaa]] and make everyone celebrate [[Christmas]].

The film parodies blaxploitation films, and features [[Melvin Van Peebles]] in a cameo as "[[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song|Sweetback]]".

==Plot==
The film begins with a flashback to a young Mordechai Jefferson Carver. At school, Mordechai is tormented by his fellow students and his teacher for being a Jewish child in a public school predominantly attended by Christians, and for celebrating Hanukkah while everyone else celebrates Christmas. He feels further alienated as he walks through his neighborhood and sees a seemingly endless number of Christmas decorations and window displays celebrating the holiday and announcing that Jews aren't welcome. As he lies down on the sidewalk in front of a store saying "Jews Welcome (for about 5 minutes)" and spins his [[dreidel]] to cheer himself up, Santa Claus walks by and crushes the toy under his foot, then gives Mordechai the [[middle finger|finger]].

The scene then changes to the present with Mordechai as the Hebrew Hammer, a certified [[Male circumcision|circumcised]] [[Detective|dick]] who has dedicated his life to defending Jews. His snappy dress (a cross between that of a pimp and a [[Hasidic Jew]]) and tough-guy demeanor have made him a local hero within the Jewish community. Jews and African-Americans have enjoyed a tenuous peace with the White Christians over the previous few decades, because the current Santa (the son of the cruel Santa who stomped Mordechai's dreidel years earlier) has pursued a policy of inclusion and tolerance.  This Santa is murdered and replaced by his son, Damian, who seeks to destroy Hanukkah and Kwanzaa thus reserving December for Christmas alone. Mordechai is reluctantly recruited to stop Damian, gaining allies along the way, including love interest and daughter of the Chief of the Jewish Justice League Esther Bloomenbergensteinenthal and the Kwanzaa Liberation Front's leader Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim.

The fight takes them to exotic locales such as [[Israel]], [[K-Mart]], the Jewish Atomic Clock outside [[Jerusalem]] and the final battle at the [[North Pole]].

==Controversy==
''The Hebrew Hammer'' parodies many common [[stereotype]]s about Jews. During filming, the movie came to the attention of the [[Anti-Defamation League]], which were concerned that it might promote unfavorable images of Jews; the film happens to include a direct parody of the ADL as members of the fictional Jewish Justice League. After viewing the film, Warren Katz of the ADL brought legal action against the producers of the film, but lost in a summary ruling handed down by the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York]]. The film also drew criticism from some Christian groups, who argued that the film portrayed most Christians as being anti-Semitic and intolerant. 

Many scenes were shot in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]], [[Brooklyn]], which has a large community of Hasidic Jews. Filmmakers were initially concerned that members of the Hasidic community might protest the movie, as they did with the 1998 film ''[[A Price Above Rubies]]'', and shut down filming. Reaction of the Hasidim in Borough Park was mixed, however. No organized protest was pursued, and some residents of the neighborhood actually agreed to appear as extras in the film.

==Reception==
The film received a rating of 52% on aggregate review site [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|hebrew_hammer|The Hebrew Hammer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
In 2017, plans for a sequel titled ''The Hebrew Hammer Vs. Hitler''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2568284/|title=The Hebrew Hammer vs. Hitler}}&lt;/ref&gt; were announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/TheHebrewHammerII|title=The Hebrew Hammer II|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/life/film/1.824074|title=The Hebrew Hammer Is Set to Fight His Biggest Foes Yet - Hitler and anti-Semitism|last=|date=|website=Haaretz|publisher=|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequel will be funded in part by crowd funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://app.microventures.com/crowdfunding/hebrew-hammer-2|title=MicroVentures - The Hebrew Hammer Vs.

He does this by going back in time to fight the worst source of antisemitism in the 20th century.

'''''The Holy Family with Three Hares''''' is a c. 1496 [[woodcut]] by German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]] (1471–1528). It depicts the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Holy Family]] of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], [[St Joseph|Joseph]], and the [[infant Jesus]], in an [[Hortus conclusus|enclosed garden]], symbolizing Mary's virginity. The infant Jesus is reading from what is very probably a book of scripture, representing his close connection with the Word of God, not only because in Christianity he fulfills the [[Old Testament]] prophecy of a [[messiah]], but also because in some Christian traditions Jesus has been described as the word of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Catholic Church|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|date=2000|publisher=Vatican: Libreria Editrice Vaticana|page=Section 2, Paragraph 1|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Responsibility of Raising a Child by Rick Bartow.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Plaque for the sculpture]]
''The Responsibility of Raising a Child'' was designed by Rick Bartow in 2004, cast in 2009, and completed in 2010 before being installed at the intersection of Southwest 5th Avenue and Taylor Street in the [[Portland Transit Mall]]. Cascade Fine Arts Foundry, based in [[Damascus, Oregon]], served as the sculpture's foundry.&lt;ref name=TriMet/&gt; The sculpture depicts several animals and objects being carried on the back of a coyote ("the trickster"), including a grandmother mask with a tattoo that Bartow's mother observed on the face of an elder healing woman in [[Siletz, Oregon]], a pair of salmon, a Pacific lamprey eel feeds, a basket holding a baby (Bartow's daughter), and several birds, including a killdeer, an eagle with outstretched wings, and a raven. A moon mask on the eagle's tail symbolizes women, and a sun mark on its wing represents men.&lt;ref name=AINS/&gt;

'''Thingiverse''' is a [[website]] dedicated to the sharing of user-created digital design files. Providing primarily free, [[open source hardware]] designs licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] or [[Creative Commons licenses]], users choose the type of user license they wish to attach to the designs they share. [[3D printer]]s, [[laser cutter]]s, [[milling machine]]s and many other technologies can be used to physically create the files shared by the users on Thingiverse.

Thingiverse is widely used in the [[DIY technology]] and [[Maker culture|Maker]] communities, by the [[RepRap Project]], and by 3D Printer and [[MakerBot]] operators. Numerous technical projects use Thingiverse as a repository for shared innovation and dissemination of source materials to the public. Many of the objects are for the purpose of repair, decoration, or organization.&lt;ref name="Make and Mend"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/08/make_and_mend_thingiverse_fixit_rou.html |title=Make and Mend: Thingiverse fixit roundup, Makezine.com by John Baichtal, 16 August 2010 |publisher=Blog.makezine.com |date=2010-08-16 |accessdate=2011-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820022400/http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/08/make_and_mend_thingiverse_fixit_rou.html |archivedate=20 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Thingiverse was started in November 2008&lt;ref name="Thingiverse.com Launches A Library of Printable Objects"&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--start post navigation--&gt; Previous post Next post |url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2008/11/thingiversecom/ |title=Thingiverse.com Launches A Library of Printable Objects, Wired; GeekDad by John Baichtal, November 20, 2008 |publisher=Wired.com |date= 2008-11-20|accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Zach Smith as a companion site to [[MakerBot Industries]], a [[DIY]] [[3D printer]] kit making company. In 2013, Makerbot and Thingiverse were acquired by [[Stratasys]].

Thingiverse received an Honorable Mention in the Digital Communities category of the 2010 ARS Electronica | Prix Ars Electronica international competition for cyber-arts.&lt;ref name="2010 Prix Ars Electronica"&gt;{{cite web|author=Austria |url=http://new.aec.at/prix/de/gewinner/2010/#digital-communities |title=2010 ARS Electronica &amp;#124; Prix Ars Electronica &amp;#124; Digital Communities &amp;#124; ANERKENNUNGEN |publisher=New.aec.at |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 25,000 designs uploaded to Thingiverse as of November 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew|title=Introducing MakerBot Thingiverse Dashboard And Follow Features|url=http://www.makerbot.com/blog/2012/11/07/introducing-makerbot-thingiverse-dashboard-and-follow-features/|publisher=Makerbot blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than 100,000 in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=JHoward|title=The 100,000th Thing on Thingiverse!|url=http://www.makerbot.com/blog/2013/06/08/100000th-thing-on-thingiverse/|publisher=Makerbot blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 400,000th Thing was published on the July 19, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:400000 400 000th thing on Thingiverse]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Administration ==
The site is owned by [[MakerBot Industries]] and run by one of its founders,  [[Bre Pettis]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]].

In its terms of use, Thingiverse stipulates that users don't include content that "contributes to the creation of weapons, illegal materials or is otherwise objectionable". In 2012, Thingiverse removed an uploaded design for an entirely 3D-printed gun. In response, the gun's designers launched a new site specifically designed to host Thingiverse's "censored" files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Daily Dot | url=http://www.dailydot.com/society/thingiverse-pulls-weapons-guns-3d-printing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open Source Hardware ==
Whereas many [[open source hardware]] projects are focused on project-specific materials, Thingiverse provides a common ground from which derivatives&lt;ref name="Prusa simplified mendel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4148 |title=Prusa simplified mendel by prusajr |publisher=Thingiverse.com |date=2010-09-18 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mashups&lt;ref name="Duplo Brick to Brio Track adapter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4041 |title=Duplo Brick to Brio Track adapter with snap-lock by Zydac |publisher=Thingiverse.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; can form. These "derivatives" and "remixes" typically involve a user modifying or improving an existing design and re-uploading it. Because all models on the site are open source, this behavior is actively encouraged by the site and community. Designs that promote illegal activities or contribute to the creation of weapons are prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/12/thingiverse-removes-gun-parts/|title=Thingiverse Removes (Most) Printable Gun Parts|last=Maly|first=Tim|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many 3D printers can be upgraded with 3D printed parts. Thingiverse users produce many improvements and modifications for a variety of platforms. Popular examples of community-based 3D printer projects include the [[RepRap project]] and the [[Contraptor]] project. Some 3D printers can be almost entirely 3D printed themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/reprap-snappy-is-the-most-3d-printable-3d-printer-yet-57957/ | title=Snappy: Most 3D Printable 3D printer yet | publisher = 3dprintingindustry.com | accessdate=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ustad Mansur''' (flourished 1590-1624) was a seventeenth-century [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] [[Painting|painter]] and [[court painter|court artist]]. He grew up during the reign of [[Jahangir]] (r. 1605 - 1627) during which period he excelled at depicting plants and animals. He was the earliest artist to depict the [[dodo]] in colour, apart from being the first to illustrate the [[Siberian crane]]. Towards the end of [[Akbar]]'s reign, he gained the title of ''ustad'' (=master) and during the reign of [[Jahangir|Mughal Emperor Jahangir]] his masterpieces earned him the title of ''Nãdir-al-’Asr'' ("Unequalled of the age"). Although largely known for his natural history illustrations, he also portrayed people in various manuscript illustrations.

==Life and work==
[[File:Mansurtulip.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tulip from Kashmir (c. 1610) by Mansur Naqqash]]
The year of Mansur's birth is unknown. His name was suffixed in some early miniatures as ''Naqqash'', which can refer to an artist, painter, or carver, indicating that he came from a family that was in an artistic profession.&lt;ref&gt;Verma (1999):42&lt;/ref&gt; A single [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] showing 'Babur meeting his sister' (folio 8, National Museum) is attributed to Mansur but he otherwise finds no mention in Babur's memoirs (''[[Baburnama]]'').&lt;ref name="Verma 1999:43"&gt;Verma (1999):43&lt;/ref&gt; He was associated with other artists of the period including [[Basawan]], Miskina and Nanha. During Akbar's reign he appears to have been involved only as a colourist in the plates for the Book of Akbar (''[[Akbarnama]]'') and his name is not mentioned by [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l-Fazl]] among the list of artists. Akbar followed the principle that all artwork should include the name of the artist on the margin. The British Museum's copy of the ''Akbarnama'' (1604) includes some folios (35,110a,110b and 112a) where his name is prefixed with "ustad" (=master), indicating his rise to excellence.&lt;ref name="Verma 1999:43"/&gt;

Early works included parts of portraits and other scenes. The earliest works were made as part of the ''Baburnama'' (1590–95) and most of these are as an assistant or a colourist.&lt;ref&gt;Verma (1999):42.&lt;/ref&gt; His Veena-player (c. 1595) and coronation portrait of [[Jahangir]] (c. 1605, made along with the artist Manohar) are early works. In 1612, Jehangir received a turkey cock from Goa and this was illustrated by Mansur. In 1619, Jehangir received a [[Barbary falcon]] as a gift from Shah Abbas of Persia; Jehangir found it rare and beautifully patterned and when it died, he ordered that a likeness be made of the bird. In 1620, Jehangir visited Kashmir and spotted a [[brown dipper]] which he described in his memoirs (''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'') translated as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Welch, Stuart Cary|title=The Emperors' Album. Images of Mughal India|page=172|year=1987|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|place=New York|url=http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/114935/rec/401}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Brown Dipper juvenile.jpg|thumb|upright|Dipper (c. 1620) from the Metropolitan Museum of Art]]
"... In this stream I saw a bird like a ''saj''. It dives and remains for a long time underneath and then comes up from a different place. I ordered them to catch and bring two or three of these birds, that I might ascertain whether they were waterfowl and were web-footed, or had open feet like land birds. They caught two... One died immediately and the other lived for a day. Its feet were not webbed like a duck's. I ordered Nadirul-asr Ustad Mansur to draw its likeness."

Mansur painted at least one hundred flowers from the Kashmir valley during this period.&lt;ref name="Verma 1999:25"&gt;Verma (1999):25&lt;/ref&gt; A red tulip from Kashmir is a better-known painting. The identity of the tulip is however debated with competing suggestions that include ''Tulipa lanata'', ''T. montana'' and ''T. lehmanniana''.&lt;ref&gt;Das (2013):148.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1621, Jehangir was gifted a zebra and this was perhaps the subject of the last miniature painting made by Mansur. It is suggested that his career ended with the reign of Jehangir in 1627.&lt;ref&gt;Verma (1991):41.&lt;/ref&gt;
Several other signed works, such as one of the [[Siberian crane]] (now no longer a winter migrant to India) and the other of a [[Bengal florican]] are in the Indian Museum, Kolkata. Some other works are in the National Museum, Delhi, the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum, Jaipur and the Chhatrapati Sivaji Vastu Sangrahalaya, Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2007). ''The Mughul Empire'', Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, {{Listed Invalid ISBN|81-7276-407-1}}, p. 815&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Siberian Crane.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Siberian crane (c. 1625)]]
Not all of Mansur's birds were based on reality. He also created fantasy birds and many of the compositions such as the flowers and insects in the background are juxtapositions created for effect.&lt;ref&gt;Das (2013):136.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that these imaginary birds were made in the style of his senior peers, Miskina and Ikhlas, and were made only early in his career as an artist.&lt;ref&gt;Das (2013):137.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of style, Mansur's illustrations focus on detail with a single bird dominating the composition. The birds or animals are in a standing posture or in a feeding stance. He often used plants and insects in the background and the floral borders, characteristic of Mughal works may help in identifying his works.&lt;ref&gt;Verma (1999):53-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant paintings, in terms of zoology, are those of the [[Siberian crane]] and the [[dodo]]. The Siberian crane painting was made well before it was formally described and given a binomial name by [[Peter Simon Pallas]] in 1773. The painting of the dodo is among the rare few that were depicted in colour and is a very important source for zoologists. It is thought that the dodo was brought through Surat to Jehangir's court via Portuguese-controlled [[Goa]] and the painting of it was discovered in the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage at St. Petersburg]] and although unsigned has been thought to be the work of Mansur or a close contemporary.&lt;ref&gt;Das, A.K. 1974.

Mundy was in the region between 1628 and 1633.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01671615|title=Wie hat die Dronte (Raphus cucullatus L.) ausgesehen?|journal=Journal of Ornithology|volume=99|issue=4|pages=441|year=1958|last1=Stresemann|first1=Erwin|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Siberian crane painted on paper is extremely detailed showing the wrinkles on the bare skin, the legs and a small feather stuck to the claw. [[Abanindranath Tagore]] was taken by [[Ernest Binfield Havell|E. B. Havell]], principal of the art school at Calcutta and shown this painting. On examining the detail through a lens, he was inspired to move away from oil on canvas to gouache on paper.&lt;ref&gt;Das (2013):114.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Ustad Mansur Chameleon.jpg|thumb|A c. 1612 chameleon at the [[Royal Gallery]] attributed to Ustad Mansur]]

Ustad Mansur was not the only artist in the Mughal court to illustrate flora and fauna. Other artists included [[Abu al-Hasan (Mughal painter)|Abu'l Hasan]], [[Farrukh Beg]], [[Govardhan (Mughal painter)|Govardhan]], Inayat, Manohar, Muhammad Nadir, Murad and Pidarath. Jehangir considered Mansur and Abu'l Hasan to be exceptional artists.&lt;ref&gt;Verma (1999):40&lt;/ref&gt; Abu'l Hasan was given the titled of ''Nadir uz Zaman''.&lt;ref name="Verma 1999:25"/&gt; Several 17th-19th century artists have come to both imitate and copy his works (sometimes with his signature&lt;ref&gt;Verma (1999):72.&lt;/ref&gt;), especially for export to Europe. It is therefore not easy to assess a true work by Ustad Mansur, which can in case of the chameleon (left) be done by taking in account the quality of the work. The painting is highly detailed and is presumed to be an [[Indian chameleon]] on account of the highly detailed view of the feet of the animal showing each foot exhibiting "fused digits in opposed groups", a lighter band by the edge of the mouth, and a line of white scales on the underside of the belly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Royal Collection|912081|A chameleon|Ustad Mansur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mansur was also a capable portrait artist. His painting of the musician [[Naubat Khan]] who worked in the courts of Akbar and later Jahangir is an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=70|title=The Indian Portrait, 1560-1860|author=Crill, Rosemary, Kapil Jariwala|publisher=Mapin Publishing|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Veiled Christ''''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Cristo velato'') is a [[marble]] sculpture made by [[Giuseppe Sanmartino]] and preserved in the [[Cappella Sansevero]], [[Naples]].

Produced in 1753, it is considered one of the world's most remarkable sculptures. [[Antonio Canova]] who once tried to acquire the work declared that he would willingly give up ten years of his own life to produce a similar masterpiece.&lt;ref name=CRISTOa&gt;{{cite web|language=it |publisher=Museo della Cappella Sansevero|title=Cristo velato: il capolavoro|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024144747/http://www.museosansevero.it/cappellasansevero/cristovelato/capolavoro.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Veiled Christ''{{'}}s production was originally assigned to the sculptor [[Antonio Corradini]], who specialized in veiled statues.  However, Corradini died a short time later, having produced only a terracotta [[bozzetto]] (today displayed at the [[Museo nazionale di San Martino]]. The job thus passed to [[Giuseppe Sanmartino]], who was charged with producing "a marble statue sculpted with the greatest realism, representing Our Lord Jesus Christ in death, covered by a transparent shroud carved from the same block of stone as the statue."&lt;ref name=CRISTO&gt;{{cite web|language=it |publisher=Museo della Cappella Sansevero|title=Cristo velato: la statua|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024144747/http://www.museosansevero.it/cappellasansevero/cristovelato/capolavoro.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanmartino produced a work with the dead Christ laid on a couch, covered by a veil which adheres perfectly to his form. The mastery of the Neapolitan sculptor lies in his successful depiction of the suffering that Christ had undergone during the [[crucifixion]] through the veil, under which signs of his pain can be seen on his face and body.

At the sculpture's feet, finally, the artist also carves the instruments of his torture: the [[crown of thorns]], pliers, and some shackles.&lt;ref name=CRISTO/&gt;

== Legend of the veil ==
[[File:Raimondo di Sangro.jpg|140px|[[Raimondo di Sangro]]|thumb]]

Over the centuries, the masterly depiction of the veil has acquired a legend, in which the original commissioner of the sculpture, the famous scientist and [[alchemist]] [[Raimondo di Sangro]] teaches the sculptor how to transform cloth into crystiline marble. For about three centuries, in fact, many visitors to the Cappella, amazed by the veiled sculpture, erroneously believed it to be the result of an alchemical "marblification" performed by the prince, who was meant to have laid a real veil on the sculpture and to have transformed this into marble over time by means of a chemical process.&lt;ref name=CRISTOb&gt;{{cite web|language=it |publisher=Museo della Cappella Sansevero|title=Cristo velato: la leggenda del velo|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024144747/http://www.museosansevero.it/cappellasansevero/cristovelato/capolavoro.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, a close analysis leaves no doubt that the work was entirely produced in marble and this is also confirmed by some letters written at the time of its production. A receipt of payment to Sanmartino dated 16 December 1752, signed by the prince and preserved in the Historical archive of the Bank of Naples, states:&lt;ref name=CRISTOb/&gt;
{{quote|text=
{{columns|width=auto
|col2={{lang-en|And you will pay the aforementioned fifty [[ducat]]s to the Magnificent Giuseppe Sanmartino on my behalf, for the statue of Our Lord in death covered by a veil also of marble.}}
|col1={{lang-it|E per me gli suddetti ducati cinquanta gli pagarete al Magnifico Giuseppe Sanmartino in conto della statua di Nostro Signore morto coperta da un velo ancor di marmo.}}
}}
|sign=[[Raimondo di Sangro]]
}}
In other letters, di Sangro also states that the veil was produced from the same block of stone as the statue.

The [[Hittite empire|Hittite]] '''İmamkullu relief''' (previously also ''İmamkulu'') is a [[rock relief]] near the town of [[İmamkullu]] in [[Tomarza]] district in [[Kayseri Province]], [[Turkey]]. In Turkish it is known as ''Yazılı Kaya'' ("inscribed cliff") and ''Şimşekkaya'' ("lightning cliff").  Rock reliefs are a prominent aspect of [[Hittite art]]. 

== Location ==
The [[trachyte]] block with the relief is located on the flank of the 3045 m high Bey Dağı to the south of İmamkullu. This spot marks the start of the Gezbel pass, where two routes met and crossed the [[Taurus Mountains]] in ancient times. One of them came from the Hittite heartland through [[Kayseri]] and Tomarza, following the Zamantı Irmağı river; the other came from [[Cappadocia]] via [[Develi]],passing the [[Fıraktın relief|Fıraktın]] and [[Taşçı reliefs]] on the way. The [[Hanyeri relief]] stands at the other end of the Gezbel pass, to the southeast.

== Description ==
The relief is about 3.25 x 2 metres and was engraved on the northwest side of a large boulder, on a slightly convex, but conveniently flat surface. It is now very worn. It consists of three sections. The left section features a human figure, moving to the right, perhaps the creator of the monument, holding a spear in his left hand and a bow in his left (the string is only roughly indicated). On his belt there are knobs and some traces of a sword. He wears a round cap and there are traces also of a horn and pointed shoes. [[Luwian hieroglyphs]] were engraved in front of his head, which name him as a son of the king. His name is given as Kuwalanamuwa. A prince of this name is also known from the Hanyeri and [[Manisa relief]]s. Whether they are all the same person is not certain, though certainly possible.

The central portion is the largest. In the upper part, the weather god is depicted in a chariot, driving to the right. He wears pointy shoes, a short soldier's kilt and a pointed hat with horns, which identifies him as a god. Traces of a sword can also be seen on his belt. He has a mace in his right hand and holds the reins of the galloping bulls which pull his chariot with his left hand. Above his outstretched hand there are three hieroglyphs which name him as the weather god of heaven; a fourth hieroglyph below the others is no longer legible. The god and his chariot stand on the bent necks of three mountain gods, in a manner similar to the main scene at [[Yazılıkaya]]. The wear the long robes and peaked hats which are usual for mountain gods, and are armed with swords. They themselves stand on top of three chimaeric creatures with cat's heads and raised human arms.

The top part of the right portion of the relief shows a facing goddess with raised arms, who is probably [[Šauška]]/[[Ishtar]]. Her head is in profile, looking left towards the approaching weather god. Her arms hold her robe open. On her head there are four&lt;ref&gt;Kohlmeyer. "Felsbilder der hethitischen Großreichszeit." ''Acta Praehistorica et Archaeologica'' 15 (1983) pp. 80-86.&lt;/ref&gt; or five&lt;ref&gt;Horst Ehringhaus: ''Götter, Herrscher, Inschriften. Die Felsreliefs der hethitischen Großreichszeit in der Türkei.'' Zabern, Mainz 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;74.&lt;/ref&gt; prongs of a crown or coiffure. Wings rise up from her shoulders. Ehringhaus identifies a six-pointed star above her right hand.&lt;ref&gt;Horst Ehringhaus: ''Götter, Herrscher, Inschriften. Die Felsreliefs der hethitischen Großreichszeit in der Türkei.'' Zabern, Mainz 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;74.&lt;/ref&gt; Her legs are depicted without feet, in the manner of cult statues and she stands on top of a stylised tree. Between the weather god and the goddess, is a bird flying to the left. The motif of the weather god and an undressing goddess, often with a bird between them, is attested from the early [[Bronze age]] on Syrian cylinder seals (and other media). Jutta Börker-Klähn proposes a connection with the [[Asherah|Asherdu]] myth, in which Ishtar in the form of a bird catches the weather god having sex with Asherdu, the wife of [[Elkunirsa]].

The relief is dated to the 13th century BC, the late Hittite empire, like the Hanyeri relief.

== Research history ==
A report was first published by the French orientalist [[Louis Delaporte]] after its discovery by Kemaleddin Karamete of Kayseri in 1934. In 1935 the American orientalist [[Ignace Gelb]] visited the site. [[Sedat Alp]] and [[Ekrem Akurgal]] recorded the inscription in their Anatolian work of 1947. In 1975, [[Markus Wäfler]] published a description of the relief and its inscriptions. In the same year, [[Piero Meriggi]] proposed a reading of the hieroglyphs, which [[Hans Gustav Güterbock]], who visited the relief in 1978, supported. A different reading of the left hand figure's name was proposed by Jutta Börker-Klähn. In 1983, [[Kay Kohlmeyer]] published a detailed description and discussion of the monument. Finally, [[Horst Ehringhaus]] provides another description of the image and inscriptions in his 2005 book on the cliff inscriptions of the Hittite empire.

A cast of the relief is displayed outside the Archaeological Museum of Kayseri.
