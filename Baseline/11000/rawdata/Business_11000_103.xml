The '''American Tort Reform Association''' (ATRA), founded in 1986, is an organization that advocates for [[tort reform]]. Its membership consists of more than 300 businesses, corporations, [[municipalities]], associations, and professional firms.

The ATRA supports an agenda to increase public awareness of, and suggest changes in, the manner in which tort litigation is conducted in the [[United States]]. Some of these proposed changes would effectively limit the ability of [[tort]] [[plaintiffs]] to recover against [[tortfeasor|tortfeasors]]. Examples include:
*Technological Presentation Method to Courtroom
*Limitations on [[legal liability|liability]] for [[medical malpractice]].
*Abolition of the rule of [[joint and several liability]].
*Abolition of the [[collateral source doctrine]].
*Limitations on [[punitive damages]].
*Limitations on [[damages|noneconomic damages]].
*Changes in [[products liability]] law.
*Greater skepticism in the admission of [[expert testimony]].
*Stopping so-called "[[regulation through litigation]]."
*Promotion of [[jury]] service.

ATRA has identified [[attorney misconduct]] as a part of the problem with the tort system and displayed a billboard targeting a particular "unethical lawyer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.atra.org/show/8038 |title=ATRA :: ATRA Billboard Targets Unethical Attorney in San Antonio&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-01-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129220814/http://www.atra.org/show/8038 |archive-date=2006-11-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of every year since 2002, ATRA publishes its annual [[judicial hellhole|Judicial Hellholes]] report, which is a list of locales that ATRA calls the worst courts in the United States. The 2005 report lists Rio Grande Valley and the Gulf Coast of [[Texas]] as the worst courts in the country. Prior to 2005, the worst court according to ATRA was [[Madison County, Illinois]]. The other judicial hellholes in 2005 were Cook County, Ill., the entire state of [[West Virginia]], former top seed Madison County, St. Clair County, Ill., and south Florida.

ATRA also awards the Civil Justice Achievement Award annually. Winners include [[Charlie Ross (state senator)|Charlie Ross]], [[Walter Olson]], [[Paul Coverdell]], [[Bill Pryor]], and [[John H. Sullivan]].

==SAGIA==
Al-Dabbagh served two four-year terms in public service as Governor and Chairman of the Board of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA), with the rank of Minister.

Accomplishments during his time at SAGIA included:
* Launching the 10x10 initiative, a program designed to lead Saudi Arabia to a top ten global competitiveness ranking for its business environment by the year 2010. 
* An increase in Saudi Arabia's rankings in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report from 67th in 2005 to 11th in 2010, out of 183 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Doing Business 2010 - World Bank Group|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/reports/global-reports/doing-business-2010/|work=Doing Business|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* An increase in the amount of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Saudi Arabia.

As a result, the Kingdom increased its FDI stock by 831%, from $20.5 billion in 2004 to $170 billion in 2010, which was nearly 40% of its GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Saudi Arabia {{!}} Data|url=http://data.worldbank.org/country/saudi-arabia|work=Worldbank|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.sagia.gov.sa/Documents/Download%20center/SAGIA%20Publications/Annual%20Report%20of%20FDI%20into%20Saudi%20Arabia%202010%20.pdf|title = Annual Report of FDI INTO SAUDI ARABIA 2010|date=10 October 2010|accessdate=3 December 2015|work=SAGIA|publisher=National Competitiveness Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Launching the [[King Abdullah Economic City|Economic Cities Initiative]] in 2005, four greenfield urban construction projects designed to capture and retain domestic and foreign capital and to increase the Kingdom's goal of increasing urban development. This initiative was spun off into the Economic Cities Authority (ECA) in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Saudi Arabia's new desert megacity|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31867727|work=BBC|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy University==
Al-Dabbagh created Philanthropy University, an initiative based in Oakland, California. Philanthropy University, launched on 1 September 2015, offers Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to Global South non-profit leaders.&lt;ref name=phi&gt;{{Cite news|title = Online University Helps Philanthropic Groups and Their Leaders|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/17/your-money/online-university-helps-philanthropic-groups-and-their-leaders.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=16 October 2015|access-date=2 December 2015|issn = 0362-4331|author=Paul Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Association for Project Management was founded in 1972 as the UK branch of INTERNET, now the International Project Management Association. Weaver (2007) recalled, that: 
:"The UK branch of INTERNET (now the APM), was originated by the ‘pioneering seven’ whose meeting at an INTERNET (later IPMA) expert seminar in Zurich in 1971 inspired them to start a UK branch, which held its first meeting in London in May 1972. The first executive meeting on  INTERNET(UK) was held in the lobby of the Sheraton Hotel, Stockholm on 13 May 1972 during the 3rd annual world congress of INTERNET. Jack Grimshaw was the original chairman, others in the founding group included Dr Jim Gordon and Dennis Gower. Annual membership fees were set at ₤1, and within a month membership had reached 78 (PMI at the time were charging ₤7).&lt;ref name="PW 2007"&gt;Patrick Weaver (2007), ''[http://www.mosaicprojects.com.au/PDF_Papers/P050_Origins_of_Modern_PM.pdf The origins of Modern Project Management].''  p. 22-23 footnote&lt;/ref&gt; 
With the emergence of the [[internet]] in the 1990s, the global project management association INTERNET was renamed International Project Management Association (IPMA) and the UK Branch Association for Project Management (APM).&lt;ref name="PW 2007"/&gt;

APM received its Royal Charter on 6 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Owain. "[https://www.apm.org.uk/news/apm-receives-its-royal-charter/ APM receives its Royal Charter], at ''apm.org.uk.'' Posted on 6 Jan 2017. Accessed 26.06.2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topics ==
=== Qualifications ===

APM Qualifications are designed with the intention of demonstrating to employers, clients and suppliers that the recipient is a skilled and committed project professional. Through alignment with the four level certification programme of the International Project Management Association (IPMA) they also aim to provide international recognition. Membership grades and Qualifications are not automatically linked.

The 4-level certification programme comprises:
* Project Fundamentals Qualification, or PFQ (formerly known as Introductory Certificate), to assess fundamental knowledge of project management and professional practice. This is assessed by a multiple-choice test.
* Project Management Qualification, PMQ (formerly APMP), at SCQF Level 7, testing a broader range of knowledge, comprehension and basic skills. This is comparable to, though not equivalent to the [[PRINCE2]] qualification.  The qualification is assessed by means of a written paper.
* Project Professional Qualification, PPQ (was Practitioner Qualification) at IPMA Level C.  There are two pathways to this, one involving interviews and workshops; the other by classroom (or equivalent study) and a series of assessments against the various PPQ (subject area) modules.
* Registered Project Professional (previously Certificated Project Manager), at IPMA Level B, providing recognition to qualified and experienced project managers.

The qualifications were rebranded in 2016.

=== Risk Certificate ===

The APM Project Management Risk Single Subject Certificate, also known as the Risk Certificate, is a two level qualification which focuses on the project management subject of risk management. Level 1 assesses knowledge of risk management, to the degree that a candidate may be able to contribute to [[project risk management]]; Level 2 additionally assess understanding and capability of risk management, to the degree that a candidate may be able to formally undertake project risk management.

Level 1 is assessed by a one-hour-long, 60 question, multiple-choice examination. Level 2 is assessed by a 3-hour and 15 minute written examination, consisting of three questions: one compulsory question and two questions selected from four optional questions. Level 1 is not a pre-requisite for Level 2, and the Level 2 certificate can be obtained without having the Level 1 certificate. However, the Level 2 certificate examination assumes that the candidate has the prior knowledge required to pass the Level 1 certificate examination.

Registered training providers offer training as well as the opportunity to sit both levels of the exam. An Open Exam for either level may also be taken directly with the APM.

=== APM Body of Knowledge + ===
The APM Body of Knowledge defines the breadth of the project, programme and portfolio management profession. It makes up one of the  FIVE Dimensions of Professionalism. APM has created a unique online resource that allows its users to contribute to the organic growth of the APM Body of Knowledge. This is a growing resource from the Association for Project Management featuring definitions, discussions, case studies and articles on all areas of projects, programmes and portfolios.

=== Award ===
The APM Project Management Awards recognise what people can achieve through project management and have been celebrating excellence in the profession for over 20 years. The robust judging criteria recognise the broadening range of possibilities within project management. With a focus on achievement; the judging criteria put an emphasis on the outputs and outcomes of projects; what they aim to achieve and what their success gives back to the profession.

He is a major shareholder in [[Time Warner]]&lt;ref&gt;Johnnie L.

==Early life==
Nevo was born in [[Bucharest]] in [[Communist Romania]] and then moved to [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]] as an infant with his parents.&lt;ref name="times2008"/&gt; His father, a chemical engineer and his mother, an [[anesthesiologist]], eventually divorced. Nevo is an only child. He is Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lovelovechina.com/celebrities/chinese-women-western-men-celebrity-couples/ | title=Chinese Women Western Men Celebrity Couples | publisher=Love Love China | accessdate=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[Stan Berk]], a former [[hedge fund]] manager who hired Nevo in the 1980s after they met at a Los Angeles gym, said Nevo worked for him from 1985 to 1988, and then "just disappeared." After a certain time period, they met again, and "Nevo had befriended billionaires and media titans.&lt;ref name="thewrap"&gt;{{cite web | last=Waxman | first=Sharon | title=Vivi Nevo Revealed: 'Attention of a Hummingbird on Crack' | website=TheWrap | date=July 21, 2010 | url=https://www.thewrap.com/vivi-nevo-revealed-attention-hummingbird-19443/ | access-date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an anonymous business associate of Nevo, with an inheritance of around $10 million, Nevo set about investing and networking. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Nevo "opened trading accounts at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, as well as Allen &amp; Co., which eventually won him an invitation to Sun Valley... Through diligence and hard work, the right contacts and a lot of the right trades during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, he turned his inheritance into a sizable fortune ... Later on, Nevo began sprinkling money around in private companies, many of which were new media ventures."&lt;ref name="times2008"&gt;{{cite web | last=Arango | first=Tim | title=Behind the scenes, a force in the media world | website=The New York Times | date=July 27, 2008 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/technology/27iht-27viviNEW.14814862.html | access-date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[venture capital]] firm, NV Investments, invests in technology companies worldwide, and is said to have been an early backer of [[The Weinstein Company]],&lt;ref name=details&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Details |url=http://men.style.com/details/features/full?id=content_4990&amp;pageNum=8 |year=2008 |title=The power 50 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608145209/http://men.style.com/details/features/full?id=content_4990&amp;pageNum=8 |archivedate=2008-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the largest individual shareholder in Time Warner.&lt;ref name="iht" /&gt; His estimated net worth is $500 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The World's Most Entertaining Site | website=[[TheRichest (website)]] | date=1970-01-01 | url=https://www.therichest.com/celebnetworth/celebrity-business/investors/vivi-nevo-net-worth/ | access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In July 2008 Nevo said that long-running rumors of an [[engagement]] to [[Chinese people|Chinese]] actress [[Zhang Ziyi]] were true.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/crouching-tiger-actor-zhang-ziyi-says-yes-to-boyfriends-drone-proposal-20150210-13ar1k.html 'Crouching Tiger' actor Zhang Ziyi says yes to boyfriend's drone proposal] Rachel Clun, ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 10 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; They separated in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/10/vivi-nevo-201110|title=Veni, Vidi, Vivi|last=Ward|first=Vicky|work=The Hive|access-date=2017-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beijing CBD before development - satellite image (1967-09-20).jpg|thumb|200px|Beijing CBD before development. (1967-09-20)]]
The '''[[Beijing]] [[Central Business District]]''', or '''Beijing CBD''' ({{zh|s=北京商务中心区|t=北京商務中心區|p=Běijīng Shāngwù Zhōngxīn Qū}}), is the primary area for [[finance]], [[Mass media|media]], and business services in [[Beijing]], [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;Latimer D. (2014) ''The Improbable Beijing Guidebook'', Sinomaps, Beijing, {{ISBN|978-7-5031-8451-2}}, p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

Beijing CBD occupies 3.99&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the [[Chaoyang District, Beijing|Chaoyang District]] on the east side of the city. Geographically situated to the east of the city center, sandwiched between the [[3rd Ring Road (Beijing)|3rd Ring Road]] and the [[4th Ring Road]], the Beijing CBD is currently undergoing large-scale development.

==Economic history and importance==
As Beijing is becoming one of the most important [[international financial center]]s in China, Beijing CBD was recently positioned as the secondary core area in Beijing's International Financial Center Development strategic plan published in May, 2008. Beijing CBD is also emerging as China's media center as [[Beijing Television]] Station (BTV) just moved in its new headquarters ([[Beijing TV Centre]]) in this area and the new [[CCTV Headquarters]] was officially opened on 15 June 2008 [[night]].

In the eight years since the government decided to speed up construction of the district, the Beijing CBD has attracted 117 Fortune 500 businesses in the financial, media, information technology, consulting and service industries. More than 60 percent of overseas-funded companies in Beijing are in the CBD. A majority of foreign embassies in Beijing - the No 1, No 2 and No 3 [[embassy]] districts are now concentrated in the Beijing CBD and its neighboring areas.

The Beijing CBD Administrative Committee, established in 2001, is in charge of planning and management and aims to facilitate investments and improve the work environment for professionals.The committee provides information to investors on laws, taxes and state policies as well as a one-stop service, which has simplified approval procedures and raised efficiency.

The establishment of the Beijing CBD Chamber of Finance, the Beijing CBD Chamber of Media Industry and Beijing CBD Association of Property Management &amp; Real Estate Development has facilitated communication and cooperation between the government and enterprises. The Beijing CBD International Business Festival and Beijing CBD International Forum have put the Beijing CBD on the map worldwide.

'''Charles River Laboratories, Inc.''', is an American [[corporation]] specializing in a variety of pre-clinical and clinical [[laboratory]] services for the [[pharmaceutical]], [[medical device]] and [[biotechnology]] industries.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, Carl Roland. ''Business Policy: Text and Cases''. R.D. Irwin, 1982, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; It also supplies assorted biomedical products and [[research and development]] [[outsourcing]] services for use in the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. According to its website, its customers include every major pharmaceutical and biotechnology company in the world, major academic institutions and government research centers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criver.com/fr-FR/AboutUs/CRGlance/Pages/home.aspx "Charles River At A Glance"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122090254/http://www.criver.com/fr-FR/AboutUs/CRGlance/Pages/home.aspx |date=January 22, 2010 }}, Charles River Laboratories.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Charles River was founded in 1947, by a young veterinarian who purchased thousands of rat cages from a Virginia farm and set up a one-man laboratory in Boston, overlooking the Charles River. In an effort to fulfill the regional need for laboratory animal models, he bred, fed and cared for the animals and personally delivered them to local researchers. 
In the last six decades, this one-man laboratory has evolved into a worldwide network. 
The organisation is constantly expanding their portfolio, and organisational growth has become a continuous strategic effort in anticipating tomorrow’s drug development needs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.criver.com/about-us/who-we-are&lt;/ref&gt;

The chairman and chief executive officer is [[James C. Foster]].

==Mergers==
In October 2003, Charles River Laboratories merged with Inveresk, a [[UK]]-owned research company. The company was known then as Charles River Laboratories. Inveresk specialised in clinical research and pre-clinical testing, and their main facilities are in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]. In late 2009, Charles River sold its Clinical Services Division in Edinburgh to [[Quotient Bioresearch]].

In 2010 Charles River Laboratories attempted to acquire [[WuXi PharmaTech]], a China-based contract research organization, but the offer was withdrawn when the deal faced opposition from several large Charles River investors, including [[Relational Investors]], [[JANA Partners]] and [[Neuberger Berman]].

Proxy advisory firm [[RiskMetrics]] had also recommended that Charles River's shareholders vote against the proposed deal.

In July 2015 the company announced it would acquire [[Celsis International]] for $212 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/charles-river-buys-celsis-for-212m/81251486/|title=Charles River Buys Celsis for $212M|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016 the company announced it was set to acquire [[WIL Research Laboratories|WIL Research]] for approximately $585 million in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/charles-river-labs-to-acquire-wil-research-for-585m/81252192/|title=Charles River Labs to Acquire WIL Research for $585M|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June the company announced it would acquire Blue Stream Laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charles-river-laboratories-acquires-blue-203000110.html|title=Charles River Laboratories Acquires [[Blue Stream Laboratories|access-date=2016-06-28}}]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017 the business announced it would acquire [[Brains On-Line]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bioanalysis-zone.com/2017/08/16/brains-line-acquired-charles-river-laboratories_charles-river-labs/&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, the company announced it would acquire [[KWS BioTest]] for up to £18 million ($24.4 million).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/charles-river-labs-acquires-kws-biotest/81255364&lt;/ref&gt; In February of the same year Charles River announced it would acquire [[MPI Research]] for $800 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fiercebiotech.com/cro/charles-river-to-acquire-mpi-research-for-800m-posts-10-2017-revenue-growth&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal rights issues==
The company has been the target of [[animal rights]] activists in the UK and US. It owned [[Shamrock Farm]] in England's West Sussex which closed in 2000 following a 15-month campaign by animal rights activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnett|first1=Anthony|last2=Ridley|first2=Yvonne|title=Monkey farm 'death trail' exposed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/may/09/yvonneridley.theobserver|accessdate=3 September 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=8 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Protest site monkey farm to close.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Protest+site+monkey+farm+to+close.-a060767439|accessdate=3 September 2015|agency=Coventry Evening Telegraph|date=11 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2007, two monkeys at the company’s Sparks, Nevada, facility had their fingers amputated after they were caught in the wiring of their cages while being moved, and a third monkey suffered a cut to its tail.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ghastly Slaughter of Research Monkeys Prompts Calls for Oversight|url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/03/17/ghastly-slaughter-research-monkeys/|accessdate=3 September 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Fox News|date=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, 32 cynomolgus [[primates]], also known as [[crab-eating macaque]]s, died of overheating at the company's Sparks, Nevada, laboratory after a climate system failure. [[PETA]] filed a complaint with the [[USDA]] over the incident. The  following year, a monkey died at the same facility after being left in their cage as it was going through a hot cage washer. Charles River was fined $14,500 for the two incidents. The company subsequently closed their Sparks facility.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sonner|first1=Scott|title=Animal deaths spark call for fining of Nevada, other testing labs|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada-and-west/animal-deaths-spark-call-fining-nevada-other-testing-labs|accessdate=3 September 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Las Vegas Review Journal|date=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PETA]] owns $2,000 worth of shares in the company, enough to introduce formal resolutions regarding animal care during the company’s annual shareholder meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooper|first1=Warren|title=PETA takes on Merck, Pfizer animal testing policies|url=http://www.nj.com/hunterdon-county-democrat/index.ssf/2012/12/peta_takes_on_merck_pfizer_ani.html|accessdate=3 September 2015|agency=NJ.com|publisher=NJN Publishing|date=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chua Cheng Bok''' ({{zh|t=|s=蔡正木|p=Cài Zhèng Mù}}) was one of Malaysia’s most prominent businessmen in the first half of the 20th century, and opened the region’s first cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=At the Coliseum Theatre|journal=The Straits Times|date=14 May 1932|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Malacca]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.studymode.com/essays/Chua-Cheng-Bokmr-Chua-Cheng-Bok-64111672.html|title=Chua Cheng BokMr Chua Cheng Bok Essay - 393 Words|work=StudyMode|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1880 as the second son of an immigrant family coming from [[Fujian|Fukien]], ([[Fujian]] Province). His father Mr. Chua Toh started his life as nutmeg dealer in his young age. He had five sons: Chua Cheng Tuan (the eldest), Chua Cheng Bok, Chua Cheng Hee, Chua Cheng Hock and Chua Cheng Liat. Chua Toh died in 1908 and was buried in [[Bukit Cina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Librarian|first1=Rojak|title=Chua Cheng Hock (Bukit Brown)|url=http://mymindisrojak.blogspot.com/2012/04/chua-cheng-hock-bukit-brown.html|website=mymindisrojak.blogspot|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his older brother, Chua Cheng Tuan, Chua Cheng Bok worked for Riley, Hargreaves and Co and Federated Engineering for a few years. They started their first business, [[Federal Stores]], before forming the [[Cycle and Carriage]] in Kuala Lumpur on July 15, 1899. In the early 1900s, the Cycle and Carriage business was successful. It opened a branch under the name of C&amp;C Co in Singapore in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Solomon|first1=Eli|title=Motoring Archives - Cycle &amp; Carriage Co.|url=http://www.currypotproductions.com/CNCLtd-History.htm|website=currypotproductions.com|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conservatorship''' is a legal concept in the [[United States]]. A guardian or a protector is appointed by a judge to manage the financial affairs and/or daily life of another due to physical or mental limitations, or old age.&lt;ref name="al"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is a Conservatorship|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/estate_planning/conservatorship.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=20 December 2017|date=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person under conservatorship is a "conservatee," a term that can refer to an adult. A person under guardianship is a "ward," a term that can also refer to a minor child.

The '''conservator''' may be only of the "estate" (financial affairs), but may be also of the "person," wherein the conservator takes charge of overseeing the daily activities, such as health care or living arrangements of the '''conservatee'''. A conservator of the person is more typically called a [[legal guardian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lawbytes|url=http://www.selegal.org/conservatorships.htm|website=Southeast Tennessee Legal Services|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appointment==
Conservatorship is established either by [[court order]] (with regard to individuals) or via a statutory or regulatory authority (with regard to organizations such as business entities). In other legal terms, a conservatorship may refer to the legal responsibilities over a person who is [[mentally disordered]], including individuals who are [[psychotic]], [[suicidal]], demented, incapacitated, or in some other way unable to make legal, medical or financial decisions on behalf of themselves.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Baxter |first=Lawrence |last2=Brown |first2=Bill |last3=Cox |first3=Jim |title=Finally, A Bridge to Somewhere |newspaper=Huffington Post |date=February 27, 2009 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lawrence-baxter-bill-brown-and-james-cox/finally-a-bridge-to-somew_b_170688.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to government control of private corporations such as [[Freddie Mac]] or [[Fannie Mae]], conservatorship implies a more temporary control than does [[nationalization]].

==Conservatorship of persons==
Conservatorship is a legal term referring to the legal responsibilities of a conservator over the affairs of a person who has been deemed [[gravely disabled]] by the court and unable to meet his or her basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter. They are governed by the state's individual laws. Terminology varies, and some states or jurisdictions may refer to a conservator as a guardian of the estate or as a trustee.

Conservatorships are generally put in place for severely mentally ill individuals who are gravely disabled, elderly individuals with dementia or Alzheimer's disease who lack mental capacity, or individuals with developmental disabilities who may or may not lack mental capacity. Mental capacity normally must to be evaluated by a medical physician or a psychiatrist experienced in the field and is documented and provided to the court as evidence.&lt;ref name="al"/&gt;

In the state of California there are two types of conservatorships: Lanterman–Petris–Short ([[Lanterman–Petris–Short Act]] of 1967, referred to as LPS) and Probate conservatorships.  These forms of conservatorship are governed by the California Probate Code, and Welfare and Institutions Codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How are Lanterman-Petris-Short (LPS) and Probate conservatorships different?|url=http://www.lacourt.org/division/probate/PR0019.aspx|website=Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limited conservatorship===
A "limited conservatorship" usually refers to the limited legal responsibilities of a conservator over the affairs of an individual who is developmentally disabled, but still capable of making important decisions for himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Limited Conservatorship|url=http://www.scscourt.org/self_help/probate/conservatorship/conservatorship_limited.shtml|website=Superior Court of California, County of Alameda|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these cases, the conservatee to whom the limited conservatorship applies can retain more control over his or her personal affairs than other conservatees can; for example, he or she may retain his or her right to decide where he or she may live.

An example of a conservator's duties includes: locating and marshalling assets, such as property and money, which belong to the conservatee; using the assets to buy food for the conservatee, secure and pay for placement in a facility which would take care of the conservatee or treat a mental illness, pay bills for the conservatee, manage property by paying for property insurance, mortgage payments or rent, property clean-up, or pay for a property management company to rent the property. An example of a conservator or guardian's medical responsibilities would be the court granting medical authority to the conservator or guardian, and the conservator or guardian authorizing a physician to place a feeding tube to provide nourishment into the protected person's stomach if they are in medical need of it.  It is not uncommon for one person to hold both offices and be referred to as the "guardian and conservator" of the conservatee, even though a conservator or guardian can be appointed over the person only, the estate only, or both. Generally, a conservator or guardian over the estate is only appointed if the conservatee has assets that need to be protected, marshalled, and managed. These terms may be found in use in U.P.C. jurisdictions, even though the U.P.C. uses the term "protected person" in either case.

In most states, an outside party or agency must review the facts of the case and submit a report, usually required to be in writing, to the court before the court makes a decision on the request to establish a conservatorship or guardianship. Usually the outside party is a local County Mental Health representative called an investigator. They are often required to be experts in some appropriate field, such as social work, mental health, a medical field, or law. Procedures for conservatorship of an adult are often different from those for minors. 

The court may appoint an attorney to represent the proposed conservatee or ward. If the proposed conservatee or ward is unable to have an attorney-client relationship because of some impairment, the court may appoint a guardian-ad-litem (who is often also an attorney). A guardian-ad-litem does not take instruction from the client, but rather acts on their behalf and tells the court what they think is in the best interests of the proposed conservatee or ward, whether or not that is what the proposed conservatee or ward wants. The conservatee has the right to be represented by an attorney, and if they cannot afford a private attorney, they are appointed a public defender that will represent them free of cost.

====California====
LPS conservatorships begin with a temporary 30-day conservatorship, and if the conservatee remains gravely disabled, the conservator is reappointed for a year; the LPS conservatorship can be renewed annually, or terminated if no longer needed. Probate conservatorships are referred to as "general conservatorships", and typically do not have a temporary period unless an urgent emergency exists that is creating risk to the person or their estate. Probate conservatorship do not automatically expire as LPS conservatorships do if they are not renewed by the conservator.

In an LPS conservatorship, a court-appointed conservator over the person is responsible for managing the conservatee's placement, medical decisions, and mental health treatment. A conservator over the estate is responsible for marshalling, protecting, and managing the conservatee's assets that remain in their estate. A conservator reports to the court that appointed them, and is monitored by the supervising judicial court in the county in which the conservatee permanently resides.

LPS conservatorships usually begin in the County Mental Health system and are referred from acute psychiatric hospitals, where Probate conservatorships can result from any referral source if validated with property medical documentation. Mental Health consumers have the right to a Patient's Rights advocate, and are taken through a series of hearings while they are in the acute hospital before they reach the point of needing a conservator.

==Conservatorship of organizations==
{{expert needed|Business|section|ex2=Law|date=February 2009}}
In the United States, in some states, corporations can be placed under conservatorship, as a less extreme alternative to [[receivership]].  Whereas a receiver is expected to terminate the rights of shareholders and managers, a conservator is expected merely to assume those rights,  with the prospect that they will be relinquished.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=Preventing Financial Chaos: An International Guide to Legal Rules and Operating Procedures for Handling Insolvent Banks |isbn=90-411-8848-7 |page=32 |first=Robert Lee |last=Ramsey |author2=John W. Head |year=2000 |publisher=[[Kluwer]] |location=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Robert Ramsey &amp; John Head, law professors who specialize in financial issues, suggest that an [[insolvent]] bank should go into receivership rather than conservatorship to guard against false hope and [[moral hazard]].&lt;ref&gt;
Ramsey &amp; Head (2000), p.37
&lt;/ref&gt;

At the federal government level in the United States, in July 2008, the failing [[IndyMac Bank]] was taken into [[administrative receivership]] by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) and its assets and secured liabilities transferred to a specially established [[Bridge bank (United States)|bridge bank]] called [[IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB]] which was placed into conservatorship, also by the FDIC.

Again, in the U.S. at the federal level, in September 2008, the chief executive officers, and board of directors [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] were dismissed,  and the companies were placed into the conservatorship of the [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]] (FHFA) via the determination of its director [[James B. Lockhart III]], with the support and financial backing of U.S. Treasury via Treasury secretary [[Hank Paulson]]'s commitment to keep the corporations solvent.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The intervention leading to the conservatorship of these two entities has become the largest in government history, and was justified as necessary step to prevent the damage to the financial system that would have been caused by their failure. Entities like this are considered [[too big to fail]].&lt;ref name='Treasury-Paulson-2008-09-07'&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

An even more ambitious use of the conservatorship model has been proposed by Duke professors Lawrence Baxter, Bill Brown and Jim Cox.  They suggest that the troubled U.S. banks be placed in conservatorship, that some of their "good assets" be dropped into newly created "good bank" subsidiaries (presumably under new management), and the remaining "bad assets" be left to be managed under the supervision of a conservatorship structure.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost" /&gt;

'''Dan Grigore Adamescu''' (20 September 1948 – 24 January 2017) was a [[Romania]]n businessman who was the founder of The Nova Group, and was the second richest Romanian in 2013. In 2016, he was sentenced to four years and four months in jail for bribing judges at his companies' insolvency trials. Adamescu held Romanian and German citizenships.&lt;ref name=EJ&gt;{{cite news| url= http://ejpress.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=56662&amp;catid=14| title= The new Communists: Romania is moving backwards| last=Black | first=Eldad| work=European Jewish Press| date=6 January 2017| accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Egyptian Labour Corps''' (also known as the '''ELC''' or '''Labour Corps''') was a group of Egyptian labourers who worked for the [[British Army]] in [[Egypt]] during the [[First World War]]'s [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]].

==Historical context==
At the beginning of the First World War Britain set up the [[History of Egypt under the British|Protectorate of Egypt]] and imposed [[martial law]], at the same time giving a solemn pledge to defend Egypt and not call on the Egyptian people to aid them in the conflict. The Egyptians had become subject to British rule in the 19th century when their country [[Anglo-Egyptian War|was invaded]] and occupied by the British.&lt;ref&gt;Wavell 1968, pp. 25–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 1934, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; However, the British quickly realised that they desperately needed the support of Egyptian labour in a land which was so inhospitable to Europeans.

==Scope of operations==
Companies of the Egyptian Labour Corps were supplied to work on construction of railways and roads. They worked to manage sanitation, were employed as stevedores and on wharf construction. They loaded and unloaded lighters, carried stores for supply depots and loaded lorries for the [[Army Service Corps|ASC]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter written by General Allenby in GS GHQ EEF February 1918 War Diary AWM4, 1-6-22 p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; They laid the pipelines, built the railway [[Embankment (transportation)|embankment]]s and helped lay the track, loaded and unloaded the trains, manned the [[surf boat]]s, stowed or discharged the cargoes of surf boats from supply and store ships, and were employed everywhere on conservancy duties.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman–Manifold 1923, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Downes 1938, pp. 705–7&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Egyptian Labour Corps landing stores near Gaza during World War I.jpg|thumb|Landing stores near Gaza]]
[[File:Railway construction across the Sinai during World War I Aust OH Photo 597.jpg|thumb|Railway Construction Team]]
They constructed the duplication of the [[Zagazig]] to [[Ismailia]] section of the railway from [[Cairo]] to the [[Suez Canal]], built out into the [[Sinai]] desert [[metalled road]]s and laid water pipelines. About {{convert|100|mi|km|sigfig=1}} of railway, road and pipelines were laid in a few weeks for the forward defence of the Suez Canal before it was extended eastwards into the Sinai. They also assisted in horse and camel hospitals, and travelled to [[Aqaba|Akaba]] to assist [[T. E. Lawrence|Lawrence]] in his work for the [[Arab Revolt]].&lt;ref&gt;Wavell 1968, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 2002, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blenkinsop &amp; Rainey 1925, pp. 202–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence 1962, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;

Beside the pipelines and the railway, hundreds of miles of [[wire netting]] roads were laid across the sand and pegged down, and great reservoirs, to hold huge quantities of water supplied by filters at a rate of {{convert|500000|impgal|m3|sigfig=1}} a day, were constructed. At the beginning of December 1916, the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] had a ration strength of 150,000 British and 6,000 Indian troops, and 13,000 Egyptian labourers.&lt;ref&gt;Keogh 1955, pp. 46 &amp; 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 2002, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Duguid op p.42ELC.jpeg|thumb|Egyptian Labour Corps moving along a Wire Netting Road]]

Rail was laid at the rate of {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} a month and the pipeline construction eventually caught up with the railway at [[El Arish]] in February 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 2002, p. 80–1&lt;/ref&gt; At this time General [[Harry Chauvel]] ordered the aerial bombing of the enemy to stop as the retaliation by German planes on the Egyptian Labour Corps was stopping the railway gangs from continuing the strategically vital railway on to [[Rafah]].&lt;ref&gt;Cutlack 1941, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the supervision of administrative officers of corps, divisions and sanitary sections, troops worked alongside the Egyptian Labour Corps in the fight against pests in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;Downes 1938, pp. 705–7&lt;/ref&gt; This involved, among other strategies, draining swamps, and constructing hard horse standings.&lt;ref&gt;Keogh 1955, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Near [[Jericho]] in 1918 a 600-strong company of the Egyptian Labour Corps worked for two months to suppress mosquitoes breeding in the overflow from the [[Ain es Sultan]] spring.&lt;ref&gt;Powles 1922, pp. 260–1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recruitment==
This was carried out by native agents who visited villages in their sub-district under the direction of a district recruiting officer who was assisted by a medical officer. These two officers inspected and examined all recruits and the agent was paid P.T. 5 for each recruit who passed. Each successful recruit could choose between [[Egyptian Camel Transport Corps|Camel Transport]], Horse Transport, Labour, Remount and Veterinary corps and services. The recruits enlisted for six months and were given an advance of English £3/-/- to provide for dependents. At the Recruiting Depot the recruit was issued with blankets and an overcoat and at the corps or service depot he was disinfected, given clothes and equipment. In the Egyptian Labour Corps the pay was 5 P.T. per day while the other corps and services paid 6 P.T. per day plus clothing and rations.&lt;ref&gt;Letter written by General Allenby in GS,GHQ,EEF War Diary February 1918 AWM4, 1-6-22 p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Egyptian Labour Corps paymaster parade Romani 1916 (AWM J01068).jpg|thumb|Egyptian Labour Corps engaged on road making, railway construction and laying water pipeline being paid at Romani in September 1916]]

These men were most often from extremely poor villagers and the daily inducement of 7 [[piastre]]s (1 shilling and 6 pence) and rations was very attractive to them. When money and food were not enough, military authority under the terms of the Protectorate and Martial Law was imposed over all Egyptian officials and civilians. Then, for a consideration, the Muidir, Lord Lieutenant or Omdah, mayors of Egyptian towns, organised press gangs and the necessary native armed guards to keep the forced labour at work.&lt;ref&gt;Letter Wingate to Allenby, 8 May 1918 in Hughes 2004, pp. 154–5&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also probable that members of the Egyptian Labour Corps were 'sealed' like members of the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps by a seal being attached to their wrists. Initially the periods of service appear to have started as quite short term but became very long term as their importance was recognised and the difficulty of finding more recruits increased.&lt;ref&gt;Carman &amp; McPherson 1983, pp. 147–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wingate to Allenby 8 May 1918 in Hughes 2004, pp. 154–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also War Diary 3rd LHB April 1919 p. 43 and War Diary 4th LHB Weekly Report 5 to 12 April 1919 Appendix 29 which show the chain of command between the Army and the Muidir, and Omdah exercised during the Egyptian Rebellion.&lt;/ref&gt; By the first half of 1918 riots, blamed on bad recruitment methods employed to find more workers for the Egyptian Labour Corps, began to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Letter Allenby to Wilson, 5 June 1918 in Hughes 2004, pp. 158–60&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[Reginald Wingate]] acknowledged on 8 May, the importance to General [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Edmund Allenby]] of keeping the Egyptian Labour Corps and the [[Egyptian Camel Transport Corps]] at full strength. At first Wingate contemplated "some form of compulsory service" but such a step would not be supported by the Sultan of Egypt and cause deep resentment throughout the country. A meeting at the Residency, in Cairo, decided that requisitioning labour from the villages through the Mudirs, Mamours and Omdas might prove effective. The meeting felt this ''corvée'' system would be supported by the Sultan and his Ministers and could be introduced without causing discontent among the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Letter Wingate to Allenby, 8 May 1918 in Hughes 2004, pp. 154–5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adinkerke Military Cemetery04.jpg|thumb|Grave of Sabit Harun Mohamed, Egyptian Labour Corps, in [[Adinkerke Military Cemetery]], Belgium]]
By 1917 the Egyptian Labour Corps had over 55,000 labourers, mainly organized into companies with 12 gangs forming one company. The gang was the working unit consisting of 50 men with a headman, often all belonging to one home village. These men often sang while they worked and this was thought to be an indication that they were happy, but one Egyptian chant sung by the workers was, "Kam Lehloh, Kam Yaum?" which translates as "How many days, how many nights?"&lt;ref&gt;Woodward 2006, p. 40; Bowman–Manifold 1923, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptian Labour Corps was described in February 1918 as organised into Companies of 600 men with a Subaltern commanding officer and two junior officers. Three to six of these Companies formed a Camp under an officer commanding Egyptian Labour Corps of an Area. The officers were at first drawn from Arabic speaking Anglo-Egyptians and afterwards NCOs and privates were recruited from British units and trained in Arabic. Their level of proficiency was recognised by a special rate of extra duty pay. Supervision was provided by the reis of each gang and by civilian foremen who were paid from English £1/10/- to English £15/-/- per month. These civilian foremen were graded as 'NCO Foremen' provided with a uniform and treated as acting Non-commissioned officers of the ELC.&lt;ref&gt;Letter written by General Allenby in GS, GHQ EEF February 1918 War Diary AWM4, 1-6-22 pp. 21-2&lt;/ref&gt;

It was found to be 'practicable and advisable' to recruit different companies from different parts of Egypt and new gangs could be trained in particular types of work required to ensure efficient and rapid handling of stores and materiel.&lt;ref&gt;Letter written by General Allenby in GS, GHQ EEF February 1918 War Diary AWM4, 1-6-22 p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acknowledgement==
The great value of the service of the Egyptian Labour Corps was acknowledged by Allenby in his despatch of 16 December 1917 where he mentions the great value and importance of their service, their steadiness under fire and devotion to duty under difficult conditions.&lt;ref&gt;''A Brief Record of the Advance of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force under the command of General Sir Edmund H.

'''Field research''', '''field studies''', or '''fieldwork''' is the [[empirical research|collection]] of [[raw data]] outside a [[laboratory]], [[library]], or [[workplace]] setting. The approaches and methods used in field research vary across [[branches of science|disciplines]]. For example, biologists who conduct field research may simply observe animals [[ecology|interacting]] with their [[Natural environment|environment]]s, whereas social scientists conducting field research may interview or observe people in their [[natural environment]]s to learn their languages, [[folklore]], and social structures.

Field research involves a range of well-defined, although variable, methods: informal interviews, direct [[observation]], participation in the life of the group, collective discussions, analyses of personal documents produced within the group, self-analysis, results from activities undertaken off- or on-line, and life-histories. Although the method generally is characterized as [[qualitative research]], it may (and often does) include quantitative dimensions.

==History==
Field research has a long history. Cultural anthropologists have long used field research to study other cultures. Although the cultures do not have to be different, this has often been the case in the past with the study of so-called primitive cultures, and even in sociology the cultural differences have been ones of class. The work is done... in "'Fields' that is, circumscribed areas of study which have been the subject of social research".&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Robert G., ''In the Field: An Introduction to Field Research'' (Hemel Hempstead, U.K.: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1984) at 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Fields could be education, industrial settings, or Amazonian rain forests. Field research may be conducted by zoologists such as Jane Goodall. Radcliff-Brown [1910] and Malinowski [1922] were early cultural anthropologists who set the models for future work.&lt;ref&gt;Burgress, Robert, ibid. at 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Business use of Field research is an applied form of anthropology and is as likely to be advised by sociologists or statisticians in the case of surveys.

Consumer marketing field research is the primary marketing technique used by businesses to research their target market.

==Conducting field research==
The quality of results obtained from field research depends on the data gathered in the field. The data in turn, depend upon the field worker, his or her level of involvement, and ability to see and visualize things that other individuals visiting the area of study may fail to notice. The more open researchers are to new ideas, concepts, and things which they may not have seen in their own culture, the better will be the absorption of those ideas. Better grasping of such material means better understanding of the forces of culture operating in the area and the ways they modify the lives of the people under study. Social scientists (i.e. anthropologists, social psychologists, etc.) have always been taught to be free from [[ethnocentrism]] (i.e. the belief in the superiority of one's own ethnic group), when conducting any type of field research.

When humans themselves are the subject of study, protocols must be devised to reduce the risk of observer bias and the acquisition of too theoretical or idealized explanations of the workings of a culture. Participant observation, data collection, and survey research are examples of field research methods, in contrast to what is often called experimental or lab research.

== Field notes==
{{main|Fieldnotes}}
When conducting field research, keeping an ethnographic record is essential to the process. [[Fieldnotes|Field notes]] are a key part of the ethnographic record.  The process of field notes begin as the researcher participates in local scenes and experiences in order to make observations that will later be written up.  The field researcher tries first to take mental notes of certain details in order that they be written down later.

==Kinds of field notes==

|}

==Interviewing==
Another method of data collection is [[interviewing]], specifically interviewing in the [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] paradigm. Interviewing can be done in different formats, this all depends on individual researcher preferences, research purpose, and the research question asked.

==Analyzing data==
In [[qualitative research]], there are many ways of analyzing data gathered in the field. One of the two most common methods of data analysis are [[thematic analysis]] and [[narrative analysis]]. As mentioned before, the type of analysis a researcher decides to use depends on the research question asked, the researcher's field, and the researcher's personal method of choice.

==Field research across different disciplines==

===Anthropology===
In [[anthropology]], field research is organized so as to produce a kind of writing called [[ethnography]]. Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and a product of research, namely a monograph or book. Ethnography is a grounded, inductive method that heavily relies on participant-observation. Participant observation is a structured type of research strategy. It is a widely used methodology in many disciplines, particularly, cultural anthropology, but also sociology, communication studies, and social psychology. Its aim is to gain a close and intimate familiarity with a given group of individuals (such as a religious, occupational, or sub cultural group, or a particular community) and their practices through an intensive involvement with people in their natural environment, usually over an extended period of time. The method originated in field work of social anthropologists, especially the students of Franz Boas in the United States, and in the urban research of the Chicago School of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;A variant of [[participant observation]] is observing participation, described by Kaminski, who explored prison subculture as a political prisoner in communist Poland in 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional [[participant observation]] is usually undertaken over an extended period of time, ranging from several months to many years, and even generations. An extended research time period means that the researcher is able to obtain more detailed and accurate information about the individuals, community, and/or population under study. Observable details (like daily time allotment) and more hidden details (like taboo behavior) are more easily observed and interpreted over a longer period of time. A strength of observation and interaction over extended periods of time is that researchers can discover discrepancies between what participants say—and often believe—should happen (the formal system) and what actually does happen, or between different aspects of the formal system; in contrast, a one-time survey of people's answers to a set of questions might be quite consistent, but is less likely to show conflicts between different aspects of the social system or between conscious representations and behavior.

===Archaeology===
Field research lies at the heart of [[archaeology|archaeological]] research. It may include the undertaking of broad [[Survey (archaeology)|area surveys]] (including [[Aerial archaeology|aerial surveys]]); of more localised [[Archaeological site|site]] surveys (including photographic, [[Archaeological illustration|drawn]], and [[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|geophysical]] surveys, and exercises such as [[Survey (archaeology)#Fieldwalking (transects)|fieldwalking]]); and of [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]].

===Biology===
In [[biology]], field research typically involves studying of free-living wild animals in which the subjects are [[observation|observed]] in their natural [[habitat]], without changing, harming, or materially altering the setting or behavior of the animals under study. Field research is an indispensable part of biological science.

[[Animal migration tracking]] (including [[bird ringing]]/banding) is a frequently-used field technique, allowing field scientists to track [[Animal migration|migration]] patterns and routes, and animal [[longevity]] in the wild. Knowledge about animal migrations is essential to accurately determining the size and location of [[protected area]]s.

===Earth and atmospheric sciences===
In [[geology]] fieldwork is considered an essential part of training&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aipg.org/Students/studenttopics/Fieldwork--it%20may%20be%20more%20important%20than%20you%20think.pdf |title=Fieldwork: It May Be More  Important Than You Think |last=Price |first=Nancy |publisher=American Institute of Professional Geologists |publication-date=June 2005 |access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remains an important component of many research projects. In other disciplines of the [[Earth science|Earth]] and [[atmospheric sciences]], field research refers to [[field experiment]]s (such as the [[VORTEX projects]]) utilizing [[in situ]] instruments. Permanent observation networks are also maintained for other uses but are not necessarily considered field research, nor are permanent [[remote sensing]] installations.

===Economics===
The objective of field research in [[economics]] is to get beneath the surface, to contrast observed behaviour with the prevailing understanding of a process, and to relate language and description to behavior (e.g. [[Deirdre McCloskey]], 1985).

The 2009 Nobel Prize Winners in Economics, [[Elinor Ostrom]] and [[Oliver Williamson]], have advocated mixed methods and complex approaches in economics and hinted implicitly to the relevance of field research approaches in economics.&lt;ref&gt;see http://newlegalrealism.wordpress.com/tag/fieldwork/. Posted on October 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent interview Oliver Williamson and Elinor Ostrom discuss the importance of examining institutional contexts when performing economic analyses.&lt;ref&gt;There is a nice exchange toward the end about how much economists will miss if they ignore the knowledge offered by scholars in other fields. http://www.nobelprize.org/mediaplayer/index.php?id=1223&amp;view=1.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Ostrom and Williamson agree that "top-down" panaceas or "cookie cutter" approaches to policy problems don’t work.  They believe that policymakers need to give local people a chance to shape the systems used to allocate resources and resolve disputes.  Sometimes, Ostrom points out, local solutions can be the most efficient and effective options. This is a point of view that fits very well with anthropological research, which has for some time shown us the logic of local systems of knowledge — and the damage that can be done when "solutions" to problems are imposed from outside or above without adequate consultation. Elinor Ostrom, for example, combines field case studies and experimental lab work in her research. Using this combination, she contested longstanding assumptions about the possibility that groups of people could cooperate to solve common pool problems (as opposed to being regulated by the state or governed by the market.&lt;ref&gt;See her Nobel Prize presentation at: http://www.nobelprize.org/mediaplayer/index.php?id=1223&amp;view=1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward J. Nell]] argued in 1998 that there are two types of field research in economics. One kind can give us a carefully drawn picture of institutions and practices, general in that it applies to all activities of a certain kind of particular society or social setting, but still specialized to that society or setting. Although institutions and practices are intangibles, such a picture will be objective, a matter of fact, independent of the state of mind of the particular agents reported on. Approaching the economy from a different angle, another kind of fieldwork can give us a picture of the state of mind of economic agents (their true motivations, their beliefs, state knowledge, expectations, their preferences and values).&lt;ref&gt;For further details see Nell (1998, Part II).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public health===
In [[public health]] the use of the term field research refers to [[epidemiology]] or the study of epidemics through the gathering of data about the epidemic (such as the pathogen and vector(s) as well as social or sexual contacts, depending upon the situation).

===Management===
[[Mintzberg]] played a crucial role in the popularization of field research in [[management]]. The tremendous amount of work that Mintzberg put into the findings earned him the title of leader of a new school of management, the descriptive school, as opposed to the prescriptive and normative schools that preceded his work. The schools of thought derive from Taylor, [[Henri Fayol]], [[Lyndall Urwick]], [[Herbert A. Simon]], and others endeavored to prescribe and expound norms to show what managers must or should do. With the arrival of Mintzberg, the question was no longer what must or should be done, but what a manager actually does during the day. More recently, in his 2004 book Managers Not MBAs, Mintzberg examined what he believes to be wrong with management education today.

Aktouf (2006, p. 198) summed-up Mintzberg observations about what takes place in the field:‘’First, the manager’s job is not ordered, continuous, and sequential, nor is it uniform or homogeneous. On the contrary, it is fragmented, irregular, choppy, extremely changeable and variable. This work is also marked by brevity: no sooner has a manager finished one activity than he or she is called up to jump to another, and this pattern continues nonstop. Second, the manager’s daily work is a not a series of self-initiated, willful actions transformed into decisions, after examining the circumstances. Rather, it is an unbroken series of reactions to all sorts of request that come from all around the manager, from both the internal and external environments. Third, the manager deals with the same issues several times, for short periods of time; he or she is far from the traditional image of the individual who deals with one problem at a time, in a calm and orderly fashion. Fourth, the manager acts as a focal point, an interface, or an intersection between several series of actors in the organization: external and internal environments, collaborators, partners, superiors, subordinates, colleagues, and so forth. He or she must constantly ensure, achieve, or facilitate interactions between all these categories of actors to allow the firm to function smoothly.’’

===Sociology===
[[Pierre Bourdieu]] played a crucial role in the popularization of fieldwork in sociology. During the Algerian War in 1958-1962, Bourdieu undertook ethnographic research into the clash through a study of the Kabyle peoples, of the Berbers laying the groundwork for his anthropological reputation. The result was his first book, Sociologie de L'Algerie (The Algerians), which was an immediate success in France and published in America in 1962. The  book (‘’Algeria 1960: The Disenchantment of the World: The Sense of Honour: The Kabyle House or the World Reversed: Essays’’), published in English in 1979 by Cambridge University Press, established him as a major figure in the field of ethnology and a pioneer advocate scholar for more intensive fieldwork in social sciences. The book was based on his decade of work as a participant-observer with the Algerian society. One of the outstanding qualities of his work has been his innovative combination of different methods and research strategies as well as his analytical skills in interpreting the obtained data.

Throughout his career, Bourdieu sought to connect his theoretical ideas with empirical research, grounded in everyday life. His work can be seen as sociology of culture. Bourdieu labeled it a "Theory of Practice". His contributions to sociology were both empirical and theoretical. His conceptual apparatus is based on three key terms, namely, habitus, capital and field.
Furthermore, Bourdieu fiercely opposed [[Rational Choice Theory]] as grounded in a misunderstanding of how social agents operate. Bourdieu argued that social agents do not continuously calculate according to explicit rational and economic criteria. According to Bourdieu, social agents operate according to an implicit practical logic—a practical sense—and bodily dispositions. Social agents act according to their "feel for the game" (the "feel" being, roughly, habitus, and the "game" being the field).

Bourdieu’s anthropological work was focused on the analysis of the mechanisms of reproduction of social hierarchies. Bourdieu criticized the primacy given to the economic factors, and stressed that the capacity of social actors to actively impose and engage their cultural productions and symbolic systems plays an essential role in the reproduction of social structures of domination.
Bourdieu’s empirical work played a crucial role in the popularization of correspondence analysis and particularly ‘’Multiple Correspondence Analysis.’’ Bourdieu held that these geometric techniques of data analysis are, like his sociology, inherently relational. In the preface to his book ‘’The Craft of Sociology’’ Bourdieu argued that: "I use Correspondence Analysis very much, because I think that it is essentially a relational procedure whose philosophy fully expresses what in my view constitutes social reality. It is a procedure that 'thinks' in relations, as I try to do it with the concept of field."

One of the classic ethnographies in Sociology is the book Ain't No Makin' It: Aspirations &amp; Attainment in a Low-Income Neighborhood by Jay MacLeod.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The study addresses the reproduction of social inequality among low-income, male teenagers.   The researcher spent time studying two groups of teenagers in a housing project in a Northeastern city of the United States.  The study concludes that three different levels of analysis play their part in the reproduction of social inequality: the individual, the cultural, and the structural.&lt;ref name="MacLeod"&gt;MacLeod, Jay. (1995). ''Ain't No Makin' It: Aspirations &amp; Attainment in a Low-Income Neighborhood.'' pp: 253. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Florida Statutes Chapter 473 permits the FLBOA to establish rules that are codified in the [[Florida Administrative Code|Florida Administrative Code (FAC)]] in sections 61H1-19 through 61H1-39.

== Composition ==
The FLBOA members are appointed by the Governor of the State of Florida&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flgov.com/governor-rick-scott-menu/|title=Governor Rick Scott|website=www.flgov.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed by the Florida Senate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flsenate.gov/|title=Calendar for 1/31/2018 -
    The Florida Senate|website=www.flsenate.gov|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  There are nine members, seven are licensed CPAs and two are public members who are not and have never been a CPA.  

== Roles ==
The FLBOA has three main functions:
* Administering applications to sit for the CPA Examination&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-11-27|title=Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Uniform_Certified_Public_Accountant_Examination&amp;oldid=812362025|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and applications for licensure 
* Disciplining licensees
* Approving rules in the FAC and changes to the FAC 
* 
All current and past members of the FLBOA are members of the [[National Association of State Boards of Accountancy]] (NASBA).    

== Licensing ==
The Florida Board of Accountancy handles applications to sit for the Uniform CPA Examination. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.myfloridalicense.com/CheckListDetail.asp?SID=&amp;xactCode=1010&amp;clientCode=0101&amp;XACT_DEFN_ID=2759|title=Licensing Portal - Checklist Details|website=www.myfloridalicense.com|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirements to take the Uniform CPA Examination include:     
* Completion of 120 semester hours of college credit, including 24 semester credit hours of upper division accounting courses,     
* Complete a form disclosing: 1) whether you have a criminal record,  2) whether any judgement or open investigation relating to accounting, 3) whether you have ever had a professional license application denied, 3) whether you have ever had a professional license disciplined, and 5) whether you have ever been denied the right to sit for the CPA Examination.     
The Florida Board of Accountancy also handles applications for licenses for individual license to practice public accounting.  The requirements for individual licensure include:  
* Pass the Uniform Accountancy Examination,  
* Completion 150 semester hours of college credit from an accredited university, with certain specific required courses including 30 semester hours in upper division accounting courses and 36 semester hours in upper division general business courses, and  
* Completion of the equivalent of one year of work.   
The Florida Board of Accountancy also handles applications for firm licenses.  Firms are required to have a Firm license if they  
* Have an office in Florida that conducts audits, or  
* Have a name that includes CPA or a similar designation.   
Firms without an office in Florida may practice in Florida without a license, if   
* It is enrolled in Peer Review, and   
* Meets Firm structure requirements.   

== Discipline ==
Florida's disciplinary system is complaint based.  All complaints are administered on a confidential basis.  Complaints are presented to a Probable Cause Panel to determine if there is probable cause that there is a violation of Florida Statutes or Administrative Code.  If no probable cause is not found or if the Probable Cause Panel issues a letter of guidance in lieu of a finding of probable cause, the matter is closed and remains a confidential issue.  If probable cause is found, the matter is made public and brought before the Board at a Public Meeting.  Discipline is considered and if approved is evidenced through a Final Order.  

== Rulemaking ==
The Florida Board of Accountancy is authorized by Florida Statutes Chapter 455 Professions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flsenate.gov/laws/statutes/2017/chapter455|title=Chapter 455  - 2017 Florida Statutes - The Florida Senate|website=flsenate.gov|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chapter 473 Public Accountancy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flsenate.gov/laws/statutes/2017/chapter473|title=Chapter 473  - 2017 Florida Statutes - The Florida Senate|website=flsenate.gov|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  These laws establish authority to create the Board of Accountancy and create, amend and repeal administrative rules.  The Administrative Rules are contained in the Florida Administrative Code, Chapter 61H1-19 thru 39&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flrules.org/Gateway/Division.asp?DivID=280|title=Div. 61H1: Board of Accountancy - Florida Administrative Rules, Law, Code, Register - FAC, FAR, eRulemaking|website=www.flrules.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The provisions of these rules may be temporarily or permanently waived by a majority vote of the Board.    

Affected persons, or licensees, may request the Board of Accountancy make a "Declaratory Statement"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myfloridalicense.com/DBPR/certified-public-accounting/declaratory-statements/#1492189006974-c151c24b-78980c9a-e4686d29-a674|title=Certified Public Accounting – Declaratory Statements – MyFloridaLicense.com|website=www.myfloridalicense.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; interpreting how the Board will rule on a matter in advance.  The licensee must provide specific facts and circumstances and the Declaratory Statement only applies to those specific facts and circumstances.  The most recent Declaratory Statement covered accounting and tax services provided to companies in the marijuana industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/florida-issues-ethics-guidance-for-70450/|title=Florida Issues Ethics Guidance for Accountants Advising Marijuana Businesses {{!}} JD Supra|work=JD Supra|access-date=2018-02-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Florida Governor [[Napoleon Bonaparte Broward|Napoleon B. Broward]] signed the Florida  Accountancy Act in 1905, beginning the regulation of the public accounting profession in 1905.  The Act began both the regulation of CPA's and the regulation of unlicensed activity in Florida.  In 1927, Florida prohibited the use of "public accountant" by nonlicensees.  In 1937, the Board used that power to prohibit the use of "public accountant" in the case ''Abess v. Heller.''  The courts granted the injunction and Heller appealed leading to the Florida Supreme Court decision in 1938 upholding the ability to license unregulated activity.  The Florida Supreme Court narrowed the ability of the Board of Accountancy to limit unlicensed activity in the 1957 case ''Florida Accountants Association v. Dandelake.'' The court ruled that unlicensed activity could only be limited if the accountant used the title CPA or PA or if the public was confused in the title of a CPA and a non-CPA.  The Accountancy Act was changed in 1969 to remove the restriction of non-CPAs practicing public accounting, recognizing that many accounting activities could be performed by non CPAs so long as the public was not confused.    

'''National Firms Enter Florida'''      

The movement towards national and international enterprises who relied on larger CPA firms and more national and international CPA firms led to problems in Florida.  The Florida regulations required that all partners and CPAs be licensed in Florida.  Other than three firms grandfathered in before the licensing requirements, CPA firms would need to obtain a temporary license for each engagement because even one partner in another state who did not have a Florida CPA license could prevent a Firm from being licensed in Florida.  Two cases heard by the Florida Supreme Court, ''Mercer v. Hemmings'' (1964 and 1966), limited the ability of the State to restrict national firms from practicing in Florida.  The election in 1967 of Florida Governor Claude Kirk, the first Republican governor since reconstruction, a progrowth governor resulted in the appointment of Board of Accountancy members who favored allowing national firms to practice in Florida.  R. Bob Smith, on behalf of the national firms,  led an effort to separate the Board of Accountancy (a Florida Regulatory body) and the Florida Institute of Certified Public Accountants (a membership organization representing the CPA profession).  In 1967, Clifford Beasely was the executive director of both entities.  Mr. Beasley remained the FICPA Executive Director and Douglas Thompson, an auditor with the Auditor General of the State of Florida, became the Executive Director of the Board of Accountancy.  In 1969, the Accountancy Act was amended to permit national firms to practice public accounting in Florida.  The last impediment to national firms practicing public accounting in Florida was the requirement that all partners be CPAs, limiting the ability for firms with Tax and Consulting partners who were not licensed CPAs. in 1997, the Board of Accountancy Act was amended to require only a majority of partners be licensed CPAs.     

'''Continuing Professional Education'''      

In 1969, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants recommended mandatory Continuing Professional Education to improve quality in the profession.  Following this movement, in 1973 Florida enacted a law requiring 90 hours of Continuing Professional Education every three years.  Statutory changes over the next 30 years led to the current law passed in 2004 requiring 80 hours of Continuing Professional Education every two years.    

'''Increasing College Credit from 120 hours to 150 hours'''  

Also in 1969, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants recommended additional education beyond the bachelor's degree as a requirement for licensure.  Over the next ten years, Florida discussed increasing the number of college credits required for licensure.  In 1979, the State of Florida enacted the 150 hour requirement, becoming only the second state to enact such requirement.  The requirement was phased in beginning in 1984.  Ultimately, all 50 states would follow and the 150 hour requirement of college credit is now the standard for the profession in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=FICPA Honoring Tradition, Defining Excellence, Creating the Future|last=Lloyd|first=Turman|publisher=Self Published|year=2007|isbn=|location=FICPA - Tallahassee, FL|pages=24–32, 44–4862–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Advertising by CPAs'''       

During the 1990s, Florida was a party in two US Supreme Court cases shaped the way the CPA profession was regulated.      

* The first case began in 1991 when a CPA and attorney, Syvia Ibanez, advertised that she had a law firm that did tax and estate planning.  While she was a licensed CPA, the law firm was not licensed and her advertisement included reference to another certification by an entity not recognized by the Board.  The Board disciplined Ibanez for "false, deceptive, and misleading" advertising and the lower court upheld the discipline in 1993.  In 1994, in ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases,_volume_512?action=edit Ibanez v. Florida Board of Accountancy]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2018/06/22/kagan-gives-uva-prof-shoutout-for-provoking-good-and-hard-thinking/?slreturn=20180524114128|title=National Law Journal|last=|first=|date=|work=National Law Journal|access-date=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the US Supreme Court overturned the lower court's decision and struck down the restrictions on "certified" unless they were in fact misleading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/512/136/|title=Justia US Supreme Court|last=|first=|date=|website={{meta.siteName}}|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second case began in 1994 with Stephen Miller who was at the time working for American Express Tax and Business Services. American Express Tax and Business Services was not a licensed firm and advertised that Miller was a CPA.  Florida regulations prohibited a non licensed firm from advertising that included reference to a CPA.  Miller and American Express Tax and Business Services were disciplined by the Board of Accountancy.  The lower courts overturned the discipline and the US Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in 1997 in a case titled ''Stephen Miller, American Express Tax and Business Services v. George Stuart, Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation, et al.''  The case centered around whether a CPA and a nonlicensed firm they worked for could advertise that they were licensed CPA.  The US Supreme Court let stand the lower court ruling that Miller and American Express could advertise that Miller was a CPA even though American Express was not a licensed firm on the grounds that restricting truthful statements was a violation of the First Amendment's Freedom of Speech.  In response, Florida changed its Accountancy Act to restrict what CPAs may do and not restricting how and under what circumstances they call themselves CPAs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-11th-circuit/1188123.html|title=FindLaw's United States Eleventh Circuit case and opinions.|website=Findlaw|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;.     

'''[[Peer review|Peer Review]]'''      

Peer Review began as a concept in the 1960s as a way of self-regulation of the CPA profession, where peer CPA's would review the CPA practice of another CPA and conclude on whether CPA was following standards.  in 1972, the American Institute began a program to review firms who audited public companies. US congressional hearings to determine if government oversight of the profession resulted in the 1976 ''Metcalf Report "The Accounting Establishment"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metcalf-report.asp|title=Metcalf Report|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2010-11-15|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.''  In 1988, the American Institute made Peer Review a Mandatory requirement for Firm membership.  Several states began requiring Peer Review as a condition for licensure.  Two famous Accounting Scandals in 2001 and 2002 (Eron and WorldCom)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-03|title=Enron scandal|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Enron_scandal&amp;oldid=833981587|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; would lead to the 2002 enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-04|title=Sarbanes–Oxley Act|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act&amp;oldid=834207557|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (SOX).  SOX would replace Peer Review for public company auditors with a structure for government inspections of CPA firms.  Florida was slow to enact any Peer Review legislation. Finally in 2013, Florida became the 49th state to enact Peer Review legislation.  Florida's Peer Review statute only requires enrollment in a Peer Review program and does not require completion of a Peer Review&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hortyspringer.com/peer-review-statutes-by-state/florida-peer-review-statute/|title=Florida Peer Review Statute|website=www.hortyspringer.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;.     

Peer Review was first designed as a process to improve practices of CPA firms and the original intent was to be rehabilitative in nature.  As such, generally, the peer review reports are used as a basis for discipline.  Some states have gone beyond the original intent and required CPA firms to provide Peer Review reports to their State Accountancy Board, posted Peer Review Reports on public websites or used the issuance of multiple failed Peer Reviews as a basis for discipline.  Also, the Governmental Accountability Office&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gao.gov/|title=GAO|last=|first=|date=|website=GAO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has issued the Yellow Book&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gao.gov/yellowbook/overview|title=Yellow Book Standards|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which requires CPA Firms that issue audit reports on financial statements or performance audit reports to provide their Peer Review report to the client prior to commencing the audit.     

'''Executive Directors'''     

The Executive Director of the Florida Board of Accountancy shared the position of the Executive Director of Florida Institute of Certified Public Accountants at its inception until 1968:     

* Veloria Kelly, Division Director, Division of Certified Public Accounting (2016 - current)
* John Johnson, Division Director, Division of Certified Public Accounting (2002 - 2006)
* Martha Willis, Division Director, Division of Certified Public Accounting (1980 - 2002)
*Cleve Nolte, Executive Director, Board of Public Accountancy
* Douglas Thompson, Executive Director, Board of Public Accountancy 
* Clifford Beasley, Executive Director, Board of Public Accountancy

== Accountancy License Mobility  ==
The Florida Board of Accountancy has adopted both individual mobility for CPAs and Firm mobility for CPA Firms.      

'''Individual Mobility'''     

NASBA and the AICPA changed the Uniform Accountancy Act in 2007 to encourage mobility of CPA licenses.  The concept of mobility allows a CPA to be licensed in its Home State and then to practice as a CPA in other states without completing the unique regulatory requirements of the other states. The principle of mobility is based on three things: 1) no notice requirement of the non home state, 2) no fee paid to the non home state, and 3) agreement to abide by the laws of the non home state and accepting jurisdiction of discipline of the non home state.  Florida enacted Individual mobility in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/advocacy/state/downloadabledocuments/sumcpamobility-05192014.pdf|title=AICPA Individual Mobility|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hawaii is the only state yet to enact mobility. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accountingweb.com/practice/practice-excellence/cpa-mobility-becomes-law-in-california|title=California Passes Mobility|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Firm Mobility'''     

NASBA and the AICPA further changed the Uniform Accountancy Act in 2014 to encourage mobility of CPA Firm licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aicpa.org/advocacy/state/cpafirmmobility.html|title=AICPA Firm Mobility|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of Firm mobility allows a CPA Firm to be licensed in states where it has a physical office to practice as a CPA Firm in other states without completing the unique regulatory requirements of the other states.  CPA Firm mobility requires compliance with Peer Review requirements and CPA ownership requirements. Florida enacted Firm mobility in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbc-2.com/story/35738531/gov-scott-signs-38-bills-into-law|title=Changes to Accountancy Laws|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately 26 have either enacted or are in the process of enacting Firm mobility.

The '''Frankfurter Buchmesse''' ('''FBM''') is the world's largest [[trade fair]] for books, based both on the number of publishing companies represented, and the number of visitors. It is considered to be the most important book fair in the world for international deals and trading. The five-day annual event in mid-October is held at the [[Frankfurt Trade Fair]] grounds in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]]. The first three days are restricted exclusively to professional visitors; the general public attend the fair on the weekend. 

Several thousand exhibitors representing book publishing, multimedia and technology companies, as well as [[content provider]]s from all over the world gather in order to negotiate international [[publishing rights]] and [[Copyright license|license fee]]s. The fair is organised by Frankfurter Buchmesse GmbH, a subsidiary of the ''German Publishers and Booksellers Association''. More than 7,300 exhibitors from over 100 countries and more than 286,000 visitors took part in the year 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frankfurt Book Fair|title=The Frankfurt Book Fair 2017 in numbers|url=https://www.buchmesse.de/en/about-us}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==

[[File:Buchmesse I..JPG|thumb|upright|The Frankfurter Buchmesse with the fair's tower ([[Messeturm]], 2004)]]
The Frankfurter Buchmesse has a tradition spanning more than 500 years. In 1454, soon after [[Johannes Gutenberg]] had developed [[printing]] in movable letters in [[Mainz]] near Frankfurt, the first book fair was held by local [[bookselling|booksellers]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;Weidhaas, Peter, Carolyn Gossage, and W A. Wright. A History of the Frankfurt Book Fair. Toronto, Ontario: Dundurn Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-55002-744-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before the advent of printed books a general trade fair in Frankfurt was the place for selling manuscripts. The beginning of a fair focused on printed books is attributed to [[Johann Fust]] and [[Peter Schöffer]], who had taken over Gutenberg's printing operations after a legal dispute.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; The fair became the primary point for book marketing, but also a hub for the diffusion of written texts. During the [[Reformation]], the fair was attended by merchants testing the market for new books and by scholars looking for newly available scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fried|first=Johannes|title=Il mercante e la scienza: sul rapporto tra sapere ed economia nel Medioevo|date=1996|publisher=Vita e Pensiero|place=Milano}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Until the end of the 17th century, the Frankfurter Buchmesse was the most important book fair in Europe.{{cn|date=July 2017}} 
It was eclipsed in 1632 by the [[Leipzig Book Fair]] during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] as a consequence of political and cultural developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/frankfurt-book-fair-2800145|title=The Frankfurt Book Fair - The World's Biggest, Oldest Book Event|work=The Balance|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
After World War II, the first book fair was held again in 1949 at the [[St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt|St. Paul's Church]]. Since then, it has regained its preeminent position.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Significance==
The Frankfurter Buchmesse is the world's largest [[trade fair]] for books, based both on the number of publishing companies represented, and the number of visitors.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.buchmesse.de/en/press/press-releases/2016-10-23-debates-on-cultural-identity-and-on-intellectual&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is considered to be the most important book fair in the world for international deals and trading.{{cn|date=July 2017}} 
It is a critical marketing event for launching books and to facilitate the negotiation of the international sale of rights and licences.{{cn|date=July 2017}} 
Book publishing-, multimedia- and technology companies, as well as [[content provider]]s from all over the world gather.{{cn|date=July 2017}} [[printer (publisher)|Publishers]], [[Literary agent|agents]], booksellers, [[librarians]], [[academics]], [[illustrators]], service providers, [[film producer]]s, [[translators]], [[professional body|professional]] and [[industry trade group|trade associations]], institutions, artists, authors, antiquarians, [[software]] and [[multimedia]] suppliers all participate in the events. {{cn|date=July 2017}}
Visitors take the opportunity to obtain information about the publishing market, to network, and to do business.

==Organisation== 
The fair is organised by Frankfurter Buchmesse GmbH, a subsidiary of the ''German Publishers and Booksellers Association''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.buchmesse.de/en/about-us&lt;/ref&gt; The five-day annual event in mid-October is held at the [[Frankfurt Trade Fair]] grounds in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]]. The first three days are restricted exclusively to trade visitors; the general public can attend on the weekend, for a fee.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

In 2009, 7,314 exhibitors from some 100 countries presented over 400,000 books. Some 300,000 visitors attended the fair.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

In 2016, more than 10,000 [[journalists]] from 75 countries reported on the fair, which brought together 7,135 exhibitors from 106 countries, and more than 172,296 trade visitors.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Events and joint ventures==
[[File:Frankfurt book fair 20161021.jpg|thumb|Frankfurt book fair 2016]]
The [[Peace Prize of the German Book Trade]] has been awarded at the fair each year since 1950 during a ceremony in the [[Frankfurter Paulskirche]].

The fair awards the [[Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year]], humoring the book with the oddest title.

Certain initiatives would not exist without the Frankfurter Buchmesse and are closely linked to its goals and, up to a point, management structure.{{cn|date=July 2017}} 

On the occasion of the 1980 Fair, Litprom was founded - the Society for the Promotion of African, Asian and Latin American Literature. As a non profit association, it monitors literary trends and selects the best examples of creative writing from Africa, Asia and Latin America for translation into German.It promotes them in Germany, Switzerland and Austria by encouraging contacts between authors and publishers from the [[Third World]] and those in German-speaking countries. It serves as an information hub and [[wikt:clearing house|clearing house]] about literature from Africa, Asia and Latin America, establishing a forum of debate about "Third World" literature.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

In 2006, [[Litcam]], a campaign against [[illiteracy]] was founded. In this context, the 2007 Frankfurt Book Fair also started a [[short story]] project named "Who's on the line? Call for free" by and for people with [[human migration|migration]] background.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Guest of honour, focus of interest==
[[File:Frankfurt Book Fair 2008.jpg|thumb| Turkey's Guest of Honour pavilion in 2008]]
Since 1976, a ''guest of honour'', or a focus of interest is named for the fair. A special literary programme is organised for the occasion (readings, arts exhibitions, public discussion panels, theatre productions, and radio and TV programmes). A special exhibition hall is set up for the guest country, and the major publishing houses are present at the fair.

==Controversy== 
The 2007 fair attracted criticism from both the Spanish and German media. German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' described it as "closed-minded" for its policy of not including the many Catalans who write in Spanish in its definition of Catalan literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,510291,00.html A Controversial Homage to Catalonia: Commerce Replaces Politics at the Frankfurt Book Fair – International – SPIEGEL ONLINE – News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to exclude any element of "Spanishness", defined as literature exclusively done in Spanish, from the fair was made in spite of the fact that the Spanish government contributed more than 6 million euros towards the cost of the fair&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economía/Empresas.- Industria destinará 6 millones para promocionar el sector editorial de cara a la Feria de Frankfurt|url=http://www.economiahoy.mx/mercados-cotizaciones/noticias/25840/08/17/Economia-Empresas-Industria-destinara-6-millones-para-promocionar-el-sector-editorial-de-cara-a-la-Feria-de-Frankfurt.html|website=Economía Ahoy|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{nihongo|'''Hino Kumazō'''|日野 熊蔵||extra=June 9, 1878 &amp;ndash; January 15, 1946}} was a Japanese inventor and aviation pioneer. His most famous invention is the [[Hino Komuro M1908 Pistol|M1908 pistol]]. Most of his records were lost when Hino's home in Tokyo was fire bombed during [[World War II]]. Hino died in 1946 due to the mass poverty and widespread malnutrition in post-war Japan.

'''John Henry Fairbank''' (1831 in [[Rouses Point, New York]] – February 1914 in [[Petrolia, Ontario]]) was variously a surveyor, oilman, inventor, banker, politician and fire chief in [[Lambton County, Ontario]].

==Career==
Surveying for the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] through Lambton County, Fairbank was contracted in 1858 to survey a local property and decided to buy one himself.

In 1862 Fairbank dug a successful oil well on land in [[Enniskillen, Ontario]] Township that he bought from [[James Miller Williams]] for ten dollars.  Still operating today, [[Fairbank Oil Properties Ltd.]] is the oldest oil company in the world&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/rock/021018-3300-e.html Collections Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; and the original property is found on the First Commercial Oil Field, included in the [[List of National Historic Sites of Canada in Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=1148&amp;pid=8779&amp;h=Oil,Springs Canada's Historic Places - First Commercial Oil Field National Historic Site of Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

After his successful discovery in 1862 Fairbank invented the [[Jerker-line]] pumping system, allowing as many as ninety wells to operate off a single steam boiler. This system was so successful that it was spread to Pennsylvania and then worldwide.

In 1865, Benjamin Van Tuyl and Fairbank together opened a liquor and grocery store which became known as [[Van Tuyl and Fairbank]] Hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petroliaheritage.com/fairbankStory.html Petrolia, Canada's Victorian Oil Town]&lt;/ref&gt;  The next year he organized the local producers to build a railway spur, connecting their wells to outside markets via [[Wyoming, Ontario]].

In 1869 he and Leonard Vaugh established Petrolia's first bank, the ''[[Little Red Bank]]'', which became part of the [[Crown Savings and Loan]] Company in 1872.  

In 1873, Fairbank formed the [[Home Oil]] Company with James Williams and was its president. Home built and operated a local refinery until 1881. 

He continued to expand his oil business, becoming the largest producer in Canada by 1880. Ultimately, [[Standard Oil]]'s affiliate, the [[Bushnell Company]] acquired ownership of [[Fairbank, Rogers and Company]] in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Grant and Henry Thille, [http://www.uoguelph.ca/~hthille/ug2004-4.pdf ''How Standard Oil Came to Canada: The Monopolization of Canadian Petroleum Refining, 1886–1898''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606233655/http://www.uoguelph.ca/~hthille/ug2004-4.pdf |date=2011-06-06 }} (July 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

He was involved with [[John W. Sifton]] in building the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] west from Lakehead.

==Politics==
Fairbank was three times elected as a reeve in Petrolia from 1868-1870, then was appointed as [[Fire Chief]].  He was elected as a federal [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] opposition [[Member of Parliament]] in 1882, sitting in the [[5th Canadian Parliament]].

'''Joseph John Issa''', known as Joe or Joey Issa (born 1 December 1965), is a [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] businessman and philanthropist. He is best known as the founder of Cool Group, which comprises over 50 companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John J. Issa O.J. C.D. J.P. BSc LL.D. (Hons.)|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=34456933&amp;privcapId=20385456|publisher=businessweek.com|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At age 30, Issa's first business venture was a [[petrol station]] named Cool Oasis, which was the catalyst for the Group becoming the largest  Jamaican owned operator of petrol stations in Jamaica. 
In 2003, he set up a [[telephone card]] distribution business called Cool Card. Later, he extended the distribution business to include automotive and household products, among others, under the Cool brand. 
Over the next decade, the Cool brand grew rapidly into a group of over 50 companies engaged in a wide variety of activities.

== Early life ==
Issa was born in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. His father is Chairman of SuperClubs Resort, John Issa, 29 December 1939 – present. Issa's father was placed among the top 10 personalities of the decade 1990–2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey's father is local luminary|newspaper=Jamaica's Investors Choice magazine|date=30 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issa received his secondary school education at Campion College in Kingston.

In 1985 he became the 11th member of the Issa families to attend College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, USA, where he pursued an accountancy degree, which included one year at the London School of Economics (LSE) in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey attending LSE|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=10 February 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey attending LSE|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=21 March 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He graduated in 1988 and Valedictorian Cum Laude with a number of awards, including the youngest resident Jamaican to become a Certified Public Accountant (CPA).&lt;ref name="Gets Student Award"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gets Student Award|newspaper=The Crusader|date=20 November 1987|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey is Valedictorian for the Class of 1988|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=29 May 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey is CPA|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=4 May 1988|page= Section 1B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning home from university, he joined SuperClubs Resorts, which his father had started in the early 1980s.

== Career ==
Issa started work as the purchasing manager at the Grand Lido Negril, one of SuperClubs chain of resorts.  He became Resident Manager of the hotel a year later. During the next three years, Issa helped to reorganize the hotel as a resort for romantic vacations and honeymooners.

In 1991 he assumed the position of general manager of Couples Hotel, the first to be established as an all-inclusive by his father in 1978 when Issa was 12 years old.  He oversaw the refurbishment of the hotel. Issa was moved to the money-losing Grand Lido San Souci, which he made profitable within six months.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
 
In 1995, Issa was promoted to President of Development and Special Projects in the corporate office, a position in which he was involved in developing the various brands, including the establishment of new properties. He was subsequently promoted to Senior VP of Sales in 1996, and initiated a customer satisfaction program which led to increased bookings and sustained brand loyalty through repeat visits.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In 1999, when Issa became Executive Vice-President, he instituted marketing programmes, including the establishment of a new website to take reservations online 24/7, which led to higher occupancy levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey's SuperClubs 'Leach on the Beach' promotion|newspaper=Travel Magazine|date=2 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SuperCluds Radio Remote Broadcast|newspaper=North Coast Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Superclub's Launching|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=23 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pictured with John Major, former British Prime Minister|newspaper=The Observer|date=10 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained at the helm of SuperClubs until 2003, when he left to concentrate his own business, the Cool Group of Companies trading as Cool Corp.

== Business Ventures ==

In 1994 created a company called Cool Corp, and started by opening a petrol station in St. Ann's Bay named Cool Oasis. The company grew strategically over the years as Issa engaged in various business ventures.

In 2001, Cool Automotive Distributors was established to deliver motor oil and lubricants to gas stations, auto stores, companies with fleet vehicles and trucking companies. IN 2014, it is one of the leading retailers of automobile-related lubricants and accessories in Jamaica, and also sells basic household products such as toilet paper and soap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Growth of Cool|newspaper=The Business Observer|date=23 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shell name and workers to remain|newspaper=The Business Observer|date=23 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Neal &amp; Massy Splits Shell with Joey|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=10 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Issa formed Cool Card to distribute telephone cards in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, offering phone cards from Jamaica's three cellular phone providers, Digicel, Cable &amp; Wireless and MiPhone, and both cellular providers in Trinidad and Tobago, Digicel and bMobile. In 2003, he created Cool Biz, and introduced 'EZ Card'  an electronic top-up of telephone credit operated by over 3,000 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cool Card Centre introduces the 'EZ Card|url=http://gleaner.newspaperarchive.com/kingston-gleaner/2003-01-17/page-41/pageno-22588393?tag=cool+card+centre+introduces+the+ez+card&amp;rtserp=tags/cool-card-centre-introduces-the-ez-card|newspaper=The Financial Gleaner|date=17 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cool Card investment of $125M|newspaper=North Coast Times|date=28 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Issa started Cool Petroleum, which became the licensed user of Shell brands in Jamaica. The company distributed Shell bulk fuels, Shell chemicals and Shell lubricants, and  operasted an extensive network of more than 50 Shell service stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Growth of Cool; Cool Oasis is now one of the largest petroleum retailers in Jamaica|url=http://gleaner.newspaperarchive.com/kingston-gleaner/2005-10-14/page-76/pageno-52665022?tag=growth+of+cool+cool+oasis+is+now+one+of+the+largest+petroleum+retailers+in+jamaica&amp;rtserp=tags/growth-of-cool-cool-oasis-is-now-one-of-the-largest-petroleum-retailers-in-jamaica?ndt=ex&amp;pd=14&amp;py=2005&amp;pm=10|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=14 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, Issa started Cool Cash Loans, a provider of loans for micro businesses.

== Activism ==
Issa undertook a number of extra-curricular activities while attending [[College of the Holy Cross]] in the US. He was the founder and editor of Holy Cross Journal of Political Economy in 1988. He also had a radio programme through which he informed of Jamaica's culture and heritage while playing Reggae music.&lt;ref name= "crusader"&gt;{{cite news|title=For the Record|url=http://college.holycross.edu/departments/archives/exhibits/crusader/crusader_pages/1980s/02-08-1985.pdf|newspaper=The Crusader|date=8 February 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "WCHC"&gt;{{cite news|title=WCHC Features Two Bold Freshmen|url=http://college.holycross.edu/departments/archives/exhibits/crusader/crusader_pages/1980s/02-08-1985.pdf|newspaper=The Crusader|date=8 February 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While attending [[London School of Economics]], he became President of the Afro-Caribbean Society, a multi-ethnic group which undertakes high-level discussions on social, political and economic development throughout the world.

Issa also founded a charity, Educate the Children Fund, while at LSE and was active in fundraising to send school books to Caribbean children.

When he returned to Jamaica in 1988, his passion for advocacy did not wane, especially as it relates to a credible social and economic environment, and accountability in governance.

In 2000, Issa participated in media discussions on the impact of the high murder rate on foreign direct investments (FDIs) and economic growth in Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Answer to crime problem... Deal with economic growth|newspaper=Sunday Herald, Dollars &amp; Sense |date=27 April 2000|page= Section B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issa also commented on the state of the tourism industry, advocating for government support to the small hotel sector and seeking to stem a brewing controversy of variable head tax rates for different cruise ship ports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Issa on future of tourism in Jamaica|newspaper=Travel Agent Magazine, Hotels|date=27 April 2000|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Issa battling for the small European Plan (EP) hotels- 'Ochi' hotels cry for help|newspaper=The Gleaner, Re-discover the North East|date=30 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Issa on head tax: Cruise shipping now brewing|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=10 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Issa addressed public concerns about political corruption by suggesting paying politicians more,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pay Politicians more- Issa|url=http://gleaner.newspaperarchive.com/kingston-gleaner/2001-07-29/page-3/pageno-37696912?tag=pay+politicians+more+issa&amp;rtserp=tags/pay-politicians-more-issa?ndt=ex&amp;pd=29&amp;py=2001&amp;pm=7|newspaper=The Sunday Gleaner|date=29 July 2001|page=3A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issa had based his position on KPMG Peat Marwick figures which showed that politicians earn significantly less than top civil servants and private sector counterparts.

The following year, ahead of the 16 October, general elections, Issa took a stand for accountability in governance with what became known as the "Issa Initiative", calling for those seeking political office sign a pledge with their constituents promising that if elected, they would address two pivotal issues in their constituencies within a reasonable period of time. The idea resonated with people across the country and was supported by the two main political parties – the [[Jamaica Labour Party]] and the [[People's National Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Business heads to hold candidates accountable|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=25 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parties back move to make MPs accountable|url=http://gleaner.newspaperarchive.com/kingston-gleaner/2002-04-08/|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=8 April 2002|page= A1 and A3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Gleaner'' newspaper called it a watershed in Jamaica's political culture, and said "the proposal from Joe Issa of the St. Ann Chamber of Commerce, which was taken up by the island's Chambers of Commerce has the potential of bringing about a change in the relationship between constituents and their elected representatives," and that "it would require a greater level of consultation between those who are seeking political office and those who they hope to represent, on the priority needs of the constituencies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seeking accountability|newspaper=Editorial, The Gleaner|date=20 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A cartoon in The Gleaner depicted a politician telling an agitated female constituent, "just vote fi mi an' yu get light, water, telephone, roads, etc.", while Issa steps behind him with a covenant and pen, asking, "care to sign a pledge for just two of those?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cheers to Joe Issa|newspaper=Outlook, Coasting with Garwin,The Gleaner|date=21 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cartoon, LasMay|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=27 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issa represented the island's 13 Chambers of Commerce during negotiations with the government concerning the Cess on street lights, intervening to avoid a threatened protest march.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Issa on cess (tax) on street light:'Roll back cess now'|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=10 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Score another one for the St. Ann Chamber of Commerce|newspaper=Outlook, The Gleaner|date=31 March 2002|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Business leaders oppose street light tax|newspaper=The Sunday Observer|date=10 March 2002|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philanthropy ==

In 1987, Issa founded the "Educate the Children Fund" while attending the LSE. The school adopted the program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Student Special|url=http://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/objects/lse:cos524jiw/read/single#page/2/mode/2up|newspaper=Issue No.255 of LSE's paper, The Beaver|date=26 January 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Fund was officially launched by Jamaica's then Acting High Commissioner in London, Dale Anderson. In his remarks, Anderson said Issa's initiative was particularly welcome at a time of scarce resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=|newspaper=The Star edition 5|date=February 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A year later, after completing his studies at College of the Holy Cross and becoming a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), Issa launched the Joe Issa Holy Cross/Jamaica Scholarship Fund, which provided a scholarship to a talented undergraduate Jamaican child once every four years to attend his alma mater university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey Launches Joe Issa Holy Cross/Jamaica Scholarship|newspaper=Jamaica Record|date=14 July 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1991, while he was working at his parents' SuperClubs Grand Lido Negril resort, Issa launched a cricket and tennis training programme for young children in the parish of Negril.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey supporting sports- cricket|newspaper=Wednesday Observer|date=21 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey raising funds for literacy- Walkathon|newspaper=Outlook, The Gleaner|date=14 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey supporting junior tennis|newspaper=Daily Observer|date=11 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the new millennium, Issa founded another charity, "Global Education 2000", to help Jamaican schools by partnering them with their US counterparts. The initiative has resulted in the implementation of various exchange programmes which have benefited several Jamaican schools and were widely reported in the Jamaican media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Expanding "Global Education 2000"|newspaper=North Coast Times|date=6–12 February 2000|page=13a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, while, at SuperClubs, Issa helped employees at the resorts to buy and develop land under a project called "People Development Programme".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey Celebrating staff: helping workers to buy and develop land|newspaper=North Coast Times|date=11–17 Feb 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003, as Chairman of Cool Corporation, a group of 'Cool' branded companies that cut across many industries, Issa has set up Cool Charities, and has donated hundreds of computers, books, air conditioners and other school-related supplies primarily to educational institutions in the parishes of St. Mary and St. Ann.

Issa volunteers as a Justice of the Peace (JP) for the parish of St Mary. He is a former director of First Global Bank, Guardian Life Limited and Supreme Ventures Limited; and board member of Seville Great House.

He has been bestowed with an honorary life membership of the Rotary and Kiwanis clubs and is a past President of the St. Ann Chamber of Commerce.

Also, since 1983, Issa has been serving as a Eucharistic Minister for the Catholic Church.

== Honours and awards ==
Issa was Valedictorian for the Class of 1988, a first for an international student and an Economics/Accounting major in the 148-year history of College of the Holy Cross, where he graduated with honours – Cum Laude.&lt;ref name="Gets Student Award"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey is Valedictorian for the Class of 1988|newspaper=The Sunday Gleaner|date=29 May 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He made history again in 1988, when he became the youngest resident Jamaican to pass all four parts of the prestigious Certified Public Accountant examination in one sitting; and was awarded the Most Outstanding Junior Student by the Massachusetts Society of CPAs Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey is a CPA|newspaper=The Gleaner|date=4 May 1988|page= Section 1B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Issa is a member of several honours societies, namely, [[Phi Beta Kappa]], [[Alpha Sigma Nu]], and [[Omicron Delta Epsilon]] and a Dana Scholar.

In 1994, at age 29, he was presented with the Young Hotelier of the World award by the International Hotel Association in Sydney, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Young Hotelier of the World in 1994|newspaper=International Hotel Association|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was among Travel Agent Magazine's 100 Rising Stars for four consecutive years – 1997–2000.

Soon after taking charge as Executive Vice-President of SuperClubs in 1999, Issa succeeded in increasing bookings and building brand loyalty, which earned him the Jamaica Observer's Tourism's Brightest Spark award and a place among Jamaica's top 10 personalities for that year. The following year, he was among Jamaica's 10 sexiest men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Awarded Tourism's Brightest Spark- Joey in top 10 Personalities of 1999|newspaper=Social lives, Observer|date=30 January 2000|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since venturing into his own business in 2003, Issa has received several more awards for "developing a multifaceted group of companies that provide employment for hundreds of people in St. Ann, and in the process creating a powerful 'Cool' brand that is being leveraged abroad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Praised for his leadership (at age 35)|newspaper=The Sunday Gleaner|date=29 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joey accepting award|newspaper=Business Observer Special|date=8 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pictured with other nominees for Business Leader|newspaper=Business Observer Special|date=8 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julius Michael Johannes Maggi''' ([[Frauenfeld]], Switzerland, 9 October 1846 &amp;ndash; [[Küsnacht]], 19 October 1912) was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] entrepreneur, inventor of precooked soups{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} and [[Maggi]] sauce. He was the youngest of five children of Michael Maggi, an immigrant from [[Italy]], and his Swiss wife Sophie. He died in 1912 after a stroke. He married twice and had four daughters and two sons. He may also have collaborated with [[Auguste Escoffier]] in the late 19th century and thus commercialized the [[stock cube]] (see the [[Maggi]] company).

'''Klaus Schnellenkamp''' (born 24 December 1972 in [[Colonia Dignidad]], [[Chile]])  is an established Chilean author. He gained worldwide fame after his spectacular escape from Colonia Dignidad to [[Germany]] in December 2005.  His book in German ''Geboren im Schatten der Angst; Ich überlebte die Colonia Dignidad. (Born in the shadow of fear; I survived Colonia Dignidad)''  is a not just a dramatic account of his life within Colonia Dignidad and his struggle to survive but also shows the human nature's reaction and astounding creativity when faced with such inhumane and desperate situations.

==His Life==
Klaus Schnellenkamp parents's Kurt Schnellenkamp Nelaimischkies (14 March 1927 - 26 November 2017) and Elisabeth Witthahn Krüger (31 May 1936 - 23 July 2009) were co-founders of Colonia Dignidad.  In 1961 they followed the [[sect]] leader [[Paul Schäfer]] to [[Chile]] in order to found and built up the colony.

Schnellenkamp attended the German [[private school]] within Colonia Dignidad from 1980 to 1990, where he got the highest grades. Contrary to the official regulations, he studied natural and social sciences, in cooperation with the alliance known as AAG (a German-Chilean spin-off of the [[HIAG]]), sponsored by the circle ChilAl[[Rotary International|Rotary]]. This, in combination with his secretly written [[poems]] and [[ballads]], led to repeated punishment and [[social isolation]] within the community.

After graduation Schnellenkamp became active in the [[business management]] of the [[sect]]. In spite of his very rebellious position towards the [[sect]] leadership, Schnellenkamp managed to develop and strengthen his position within Colonia Dignidad. From this position he was able to get a good insight into the intrigues of the group, which presented itself to the outside world as a charitable community. Due to his public criticism of the [[Organized crime|economic criminal activity]] of the [[sect]], Klaus Schnellenkamp became a victim of several murder attempts.

Two years after the escape of the sect leader [[Paul Schäfer]], Schnellenkamp acquired his still missing official [[Lyceum|Chilean higher education entrance qualification]] and subsequently passed the [[University and college admissions|state university entrance examination]]. Afterwards he qualified as a [[Multilingualism|polyglot]] [[graduation|graduate]] in [[managerial economics]] and [[industrial management]].

Since December, 2005 Klaus Schnellenkamp has been living in [[Munich]], Germany. His [[autobiography]], ''Geboren im Schatten der Angst (Born in the Shadow of the Fear)'', appeared in spring 2007 and has attracted the attention of both the German and Chilean public. Since May 2008, he has been working as an [[Independent business|independent]] [[entrepreneur]] in [[Munich]].

He has used the SX-52 in thousands of [[XGameStation]] development computers all running at 80&amp;nbsp;MHz.  Some users have referred to these microcontrollers as PICs on steroids.  While Parallax's SX micros are limited in variety, their high speed and additional resources allow programmers to create 'virtual devices', including complete video controllers, as required. Refer to Parallax's Web site for information, as they are the sole distributor of these devices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19639">'''Macroprudential regulation''' is the approach to financial regulation that aims to mitigate risk to the financial system as a whole (or "[[systemic risk]]"). In the aftermath of the [[late-2000s financial crisis]], there is a growing consensus among policymakers and economic researchers about the need to re-orient the regulatory framework towards a macroprudential perspective.

== History ==

As documented by Clement (2010), the term "macroprudential" was first used in the late 1970s in unpublished documents of the Cooke Committee (the precursor of the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]]) and the [[Bank of England]].&lt;ref&gt;Clement, P. (2010). The term "macroprudential": origins and evolution. BIS Quarterly Review, March.&lt;/ref&gt; But only in the early 2000s—after two decades of recurrent [[financial crisis|financial crises]] in industrial and, most often, emerging market countries&lt;ref&gt;See Reinhart, C. and Rogoff, K. (2009). ''This time is different: Eight centuries of financial folly''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;—did the macroprudential approach to the regulatory and supervisory framework become increasingly promoted, especially by authorities of the [[Bank for International Settlements]]. A wider agreement on its relevance has been reached as a result of the [[late-2000s financial crisis]].

== Objectives and justification ==

The main goal of macroprudential regulation is to reduce the risk and the macroeconomic costs of financial instability. It is recognized as a necessary ingredient to fill the gap between macroeconomic policy and the traditional microprudential regulation of financial institutions (Bank of England, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Bank of England (2009). The role of macroprudential policy. Bank of England Discussion Paper, November.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Macroprudential vs microprudential regulation ===

Following Borio (2003), the macro- and microprudential perspectives differ in terms of their ''objectives'' and understanding on the nature of ''risk.''&lt;ref&gt;Borio, C. (2003). Towards a macro-prudential framework for financial supervision and regulation? BIS Working Papers No 128, February.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional microprudential regulation seeks to enhance the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions, as opposed to the macroprudential view which focuses on welfare of the financial system as a whole. Further, risk is taken as exogenous under the microprudential perspective, in the sense of assuming that any potential shock triggering a financial crisis has its origin beyond the behavior of the financial system. The macroprudential approach, on the other hand, recognizes that risk factors may configure endogenously, i.e., as a systemic phenomenon. In line with this reasoning, macroprudential policy addresses the interconnectedness of individual financial institutions and markets, as well as their common exposure to economic risk factors. It also focuses on the [[procyclical]] behavior of the financial system in the effort to foster its stability. 

[[File:borio2003.png|thumb|center|550x450px|alt=Table macroprudential vs microprudential.|Differences between macro- and microprudential approaches (Source: C. Borio, 2003).]]

=== Theoretical rationale  ===

On theoretical grounds, it has been argued that a reform of prudential regulation should integrate three different paradigms:&lt;ref&gt;de la Torre, A. and Ize, A. (2009). Regulatory reform: Integrating paradigms. The World Bank. Policy Research Working Paper 4842.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''agency paradigm'', the ''externalities paradigm'', and the ''mood swings paradigm''. The role of macroprudential regulation is particularly stressed by the last two of them.  

The agency paradigm highlights the importance of [[principal–agent problem]]s. Principal-agent risk arises from the separation of ownership and control over an institution which may drive behaviors by the agents in control which would not be in the best interest of the principals (owners). The main argument is that in its role of [[lender of last resort]] and provider of [[deposit insurance]], the government alters the incentives of banks to undertake risks. This is a manifestation of the principal-agent problem known as [[moral hazard]]. More concretely, the coexistence of deposit insurances and insufficiently regulated bank portfolios induces financial institutions to take excessive risks.&lt;ref&gt;See Kareken, J. and Wallace, N. (1978). Deposit insurance and bank regulation: A partial-equilibrium exposition, ''Journal of Business'', 51: 413-438.&lt;/ref&gt; This paradigm, however, assumes that risk arises from individual malfeasance, and hence it is at odds with the emphasis on the system as a whole which characterizes the macroprudential approach. 

In the externalities paradigm, the key concept is called [[pecuniary externality]]. This is defined as an [[externality]] that arises when one economic agent's action affects the welfare of another agent through effects on prices. As argued by Greenwald and Stiglitz (1986),&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, B. and Stiglitz, J. (1986). Externalities in economies with imperfect information and incomplete markets, ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 101: 229-264.&lt;/ref&gt; when there are [[Distortion (economics)|distortions]] in the economy (such as [[incomplete markets]] or imperfect information),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econport.org/content/handbook/Imperfect-Information.html|title=EconPort - Imperfect Information|website=www.econport.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; policy intervention can make everyone better off in a [[Pareto efficiency]] sense. Indeed, a number of authors have shown that when agents face borrowing constraints or other sorts of financial frictions, pecuniary externalities arise and different distortions appear, such as overborrowing, excessive risk-taking, and excessive levels of short-term debt.&lt;ref&gt;For surveys in this literature, see e.g. Bianchi, J. (2010). Credit externalities: Macroeconomic effects and policy implications. ''American Economic Review: Papers &amp; Proceedings'', 100: 398-402; and Korinek, A. (2011). The new economics of prudential capital controls: A research agenda. University of Maryland. Mimeo.&lt;/ref&gt; In these environments macroprudential intervention can improve social efficiency. An [[International Monetary Fund]] policy study argues that risk externalities between financial institutions and from them to the real economy are market failures that justify macroprudential regulation.&lt;ref&gt;De Nicolo, G., G. Favara and L. Ratnovski (2012). Externalities and macroprudential policy, IMF Staff Discussion Note 12/05.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mood swings paradigm, [[animal spirits (Keynes)]] critically influence the behavior of financial institutions' managers, causing excess of optimism in good times and sudden risk retrenchment on the way down. As a result, pricing signals in financial markets may be inefficient, increasing the likelihood of systemic trouble. A role for a forward-looking macroprudential supervisor, moderating uncertainty and alert to the risks of financial innovation, is therefore justified.

== Indicators of systemic risk ==

In order to measure [[systemic risk]], macroprudential regulation relies on several indicators. As mentioned in Borio (2003),&lt;ref&gt;Borio, C. (2003). ''Op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; an important distinction is between measuring contributions to risk of individual institutions (''the cross-sectional dimension'') and measuring the evolution (i.e. procyclicality) of [[systemic risk]] through time (''the time dimension''). 

The cross-sectional dimension of risk can be monitored by tracking [[balance sheet]] information—total assets and their composition, [[liability (financial accounting)]] and capital structure—as well as the value of the institutions' trading securities and securities available for sale. Additionally, other sophisticated financial tools and models have been developed to assess the interconectedness across intermediaries (such as CoVaR),&lt;ref&gt;See Adrian, T. and Brunnermeier, M. (2011). CoVaR. NBER Working Papers 17454, National Bureau of Economic Research.&lt;/ref&gt; and each institution's contribution to [[systemic risk]] (identified as "Marginal Expected Shortfall" in Acharya et al., 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Acharya, V., Pederssen, L., Phillipon, T. and Richardson, M. (2010). Measuring Systemic Risk. New York University. Mimeo.&lt;/ref&gt; 

To address the time dimension of risk, a wide set of variables are typically used, for instance: ratio of credit to [[GDP]], real [[asset]] prices, ratio of non-core to core liabilities of the banking sector, and monetary aggregates. Some early warning indicators have been developed encompassing these and other pieces of financial data (see, e.g., Borio and Drehmann, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Borio, C. and Drehmann, M. (2009). Assessing the Risk of Banking Crises – Revisited. BIS Quarterly Review, March.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, macro stress tests are employed to identify vulnerabilities in the wake of a simulated adverse outcome.

== Macroprudential tools ==

A large number of instruments have been proposed;&lt;ref&gt;See, ''inter alia'', Shin, H. (2011). Macroprudential policies beyond Basel III. In: BIS Papers No 60, December; Hanson, S., Kashyap, A. and Stein, J. (2011). A macroprudential approach to financial regulation. ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 25: 3-28; Goodhart C. and Perotti, E. (2012). Preventive macroprudential policy. VoxEU.org, 29 February; and the references in Galati, G. and Moessner, R. (2011). Macroprudential policy -- a literature review. BIS Working Papers No 337, February.&lt;/ref&gt; however, there is no agreement about which one should play the primary role in the implementation of macroprudential policy. 

Most of these instruments are aimed to prevent the procyclicality of the financial system on the [[asset]] and liability sides, such as:

*Cap on [[loan-to-value ratio]] and loan loss provisions
*Cap on [[debt-to-income ratio]]

The following tools serve the same purpose, but additional specific functions have been attributed to them, as noted below:

*Countercyclical [[capital requirement]] - to avoid excessive balance-sheet shrinkage from banks in trouble.
*Cap on [[Leverage (finance)| leverage]] - to limit [[asset]] growth by tying banks' assets to their [[Equity (finance)|equity]].
*Levy on non-core liabilities - to mitigate pricing distorsions that cause excessive [[asset]] growth.
*Time-varying [[reserve requirement]] - as a means to control capital flows with prudential purposes, especially for emerging economies.

To prevent the accumulation of excessive short-term debt: 

*[[Liquidity]] coverage ratio
*[[Liquidity]] risk charges that penalize short-term funding
*Capital requirement surcharges proportional to size of maturity mismatch
*Minimum haircut requirements on [[asset]]-backed securities

In addition, different types of contingent capital instruments (e.g., "contingent convertibles" and "capital insurance") have been proposed to facilitate bank's recapitalization in a crisis event.).&lt;ref&gt; Raviv, A., (2004). Bank Stability and Market Discipline: Debt-for-Equity Swap versus Subordinated Notes. Brandeis University. Mimeo.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Flannery, M., (2002). No pain, no gain? Effecting market discipline via ‘reverse convertible debentures. Chapter 5 of Hall S. Scott, ed. Capital Adequacy Beyond Basel:
Banking Securities and Insurance, Oxford: Oxford University Press. Mimeo.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implementation in Basel III ===

Several aspects of [[Basel III]] reflect a macroprudential approach to financial regulation.&lt;ref&gt;See Borio, C. (2011). Rediscovering the macroeconomic roots of financial stability policy: journey, challenges and a way forward. BIS Working Papers No 354, September.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] acknowledges the systemic significance of financial institutions in the rules text. More concretely, under [[Basel III]] banks' capital requirements have been strengthened and new [[liquidity]] requirements, a leverage cap and a countercyclical capital buffer have been introduced. Also, the largest and most globally active banks are required to hold more and higher-quality capital, which is consistent with the cross-section approach to [[systemic risk]].

=== Effectiveness of macroprudential tools ===

For the case of Spain, Saurina (2009) argues that dynamic loan loss provisions (introduced in July 2000) are helpful to deal with procyclicality in banking, as banks are able to build up buffers for bad times.&lt;ref&gt;Saurina, J. (2009). Dynamic provisioning: The case of Spain. The World Bank. Note Number 7, July.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Using data from the UK, Aiyar et al. (2012) find that unregulated banks in the UK have been able to partially offset changes in credit supply induced by time-varying minimum capital requirements over regulated banks. Hence, they infer a potentially substantial "leakage" of macroprudential regulation of bank capital.&lt;ref&gt;Aiyar, S., Calomiris, C. and Wieladek, T. (2011). Does Macro-Pru leak? Evidence from a UK policy experiment. NBER Working Papers 17822, National Bureau of Economic Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[emerging markets]], several central banks have applied macroprudential policies (e.g., use of reserve requirements) at least since the aftermath of the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] and the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]]. Most of these central banks' authorities consider that such tools effectively contributed to the resilience of their domestic financial systems in the wake of the [[late-2000s financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;For the case of some Latin American countries, see e.g. Castillo, P., Contreras, A., Quispe, Z. and Rojas, Y. (2011). Política macroprudencial en los países de la región. In: Revista Moneda, Central Bank of Peru.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Costs of macroprudential regulation  ==

There is available theoretical and empirical evidence on the positive effect of finance on long-term economic growth. Accordingly, concerns have been raised about the impact of macroprudential policies on the dynamism of financial markets and, in turn, on investment and [[economic growth]]. Popov and Smets (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Popov, A. and Smets, F. (2012). On the tradeoff between growth and stability: The role of financial markets. VoxEU.org, 3 November.&lt;/ref&gt; thus recommend that macroprudential tools be employed more forcefully during costly booms driven by overborrowing, targeting the sources of externalities but preserving the positive contribution of financial markets to growth. 

In analyzing the costs of higher capital requirements implied by a macroprudential approach, Hanson et al. (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, S., Kashyap, A. and Stein, J. (2011). A macroprudential approach to financial regulation. ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 25: 3-28.&lt;/ref&gt; report that the long-run effects on loan rates for borrowers should be quantitatively small.&lt;ref&gt;See also Schanz, J., Aikman, D., Collazos, P., Farag, M., Gregory, D. and Kapadia, S. (2011). The long-term economic impact of higher capital levels. In: BIS Papers No 60, December, as well as the references cited therein.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some theoretical studies indicate that macroprudential policies may have a positive contribution to long-run average growth. Jeanne and Korinek (2011),&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne, O. and Korinek, A. (2011). Booms, Bust and Growth. Johns Hopkins University and University of Maryland. Mimeo.&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, show that in a model with externalities of crises that occur under financial liberalization, well-designed macroprudential regulation both reduces crisis risk and increases long-run growth as it mitigates the cycles of [[boom and bust]].

== Institutional aspects ==

The macroprudential supervisory authority may be given to a single entity, existing (such as central banks) or new, or be a shared responsibility among different institutions (e.g., monetary and fiscal authorities). Illustratively, the management of [[systemic risk]] in the United States is centralized in the [[Financial Stability Oversight Council]] (FSOC), established in 2010. It is chaired by the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]] and its members include the Chairman of the [[Federal Reserve System]] and all the principal U.S. regulatory bodies. In Europe, the task has also been assigned since 2010 to a new body, the [[European Systemic Risk Board]] (ESRB), whose operations are supported by the [[European Central Bank]]. Unlike its U.S. counterpart, the ESRB lacks direct enforcement power.

=== Role of central banks ===

In pursuing their goal of preserving price stability, central banks remain attentive to the evolution of real and financial markets. Thus, a complementary relationship between macroprudential and [[monetary policy]] has been advocated, even if the macroprudential supervisory authority is not given to the central bank itself. This is well reflected by the organizational structure of institutions such as the [[Financial Stability Oversight Council]] and [[European Systemic Risk Board]], where central bankers have a decisive participation. The question of whether [[monetary policy]] should directly counter financial imbalances remains more controversial, although it has indeed been proposed as a tentative supplementary tool for addressing [[asset]] price bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;See Bernanke, B (2008). Monetary policy and the housing bubble. Speech at the Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association, Atlanta, Georgia. January 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International dimension ===

On the international level, there are several potential sources of leakage and [[arbitrage]] from macroprudential regulation, such as banks' lending via foreign branches and direct cross-border lending.&lt;ref&gt;Bank of England (2009), ''Op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as emerging economies impose controls on capital flows with prudential purposes, other countries may suffer negative [[spillover effects]].&lt;ref&gt;Korinek, A. (2011), ''Op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, global coordination of macroprudential policies is considered as necessary to foster their effectiveness.

The '''Master of Accountancy''' ('''M.Acc.''' or '''M.Acy.'''), alternatively '''Master of Science in Accountancy''' ('''M.S.Acy.''') or '''Master of Professional Accountancy''' ('''M.P.Acy.''') is a graduate [[professional degree]] designed to prepare students for public accounting and to provide them with the 150 credit hours of classroom, but mostly clinical hours, required by most states before taking the [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination]]. 

Similar graduate programs exist in [[Canada]], where certain [[universities in Canada|universities]] such as [[University of Waterloo]]'s [[University of Waterloo School of Accounting and Finance|School of Accounting and Finance]], or [[Carleton University]]'s [[Sprott School of Business]], offer the MAcc and waive all education requirements up until the [[Uniform Evaluation|Common Final Examination]] (CFE) in order to become a [[Chartered Professional Accountant|Canadian CPA]]. 

A Master of Professional Accounting can also be obtained from [[Australia|Australian]] universities to qualify for the [[CPA Australia|Australian CPA]], [[Institute of Public Accountants|IPA]] or [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia|CA]].

This specialty program usually runs one to two years in length and contains from ten to twelve three semester credit courses (30 to 36 semester hours total). The program may consist of all graduate accounting courses or a combination of graduate accounting courses, graduate management, tax, leadership and other graduate business electives. The program is designed to not only prepare students for the CPA examination but also to provide a strong knowledge of accounting principles and business applications. 

Graduates entering corporate accounting or [[consulting firm|consulting]] often additionally (alternatively) pursue the [[Certified Management Accountant]] (CMA), [[Certified Internal Auditor]] (CIA) or other certifications.  

Note that in other countries, the degree's purpose may differ.  Where the [[Bachelor of Accountancy]] is the prerequisite for professional practice, for example in [[South Africa]], the Master of Accountancy then comprises specialized [[coursework]] in a [[Accounting#Topics|specific area of accountancy]] ([[Computer-aided audit tools|computer auditing]], taxation...), as opposed to CPA preparation as above. It may also be offered as a research based program,&lt;ref&gt; For example: [http://econ.ufs.ac.za/content.aspx?id=176 Free State University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129153153/http://econ.ufs.ac.za/content.aspx?id=176 |date=2014-11-29 }}, [http://academic.sun.ac.za/accounting/prospective.html Stellenbosch University], [http://www.unisa.ac.za/qualificationsMD/index.asp?link=http://www.unisa.ac.za/qualificationsMD/qualifications/98656.html UNISA] .&lt;/ref&gt; granting access to doctoral programs.

'''Milton H. Biow''' (1892–1976) was an American advertising executive who founded the Biow Company.&lt;ref name=NYTBiowObit&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1976/02/03/archives/milton-biow-dies-headed-ad-agency-recognized-as-an-originator-of.html?nytmobile=0 New York Times: "MILTON BIOW DIES" by Burton Lindheim] February 3, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Biow is recognized as one of the pioneers of the modern school of advertising.&lt;ref name=NYTBiowObit /&gt;

==Biography==
Biow was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family.&lt;ref name=JVL&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/advertising Jewish Virtual Library: "Modern Jewish History: Advertising"] retrieved May 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2007/07/mad_men_and_made_men.html Slate: "Mad Men and Made Men - AMC's new series could have been the Sopranos of advertising. It's not." By Adam Hanft] July 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, Biow started a one-man advertising office in [[New York City]],&lt;ref name=NYTBiowObit /&gt; entering an industry then dominated by [[WASPs|White, Anglo-Saxon Protestants]].&lt;ref name=Slate /&gt; It quickly grew to become one of the largest advertising agencies in the United States topping $50 million in revenues at its highest winning major accounts such as [[Anacin]], [[Pepsi|Pepsi‐Cola]], [[Eversharp]], Ruppert beer, [[Schenley whisky]] and [[Lady Esther]] cosmetics.&lt;ref name=NYTBiowObit /&gt; Biow's agency was credited as the first to develop a national advertising campaign that used short and catchy advertising slogans on radio and television (such as "Bulova Watch Time" and Johnny's "Call for Philip Morris").&lt;ref name=NYTBiowObit /&gt; He was also responsible for bringing ''[[The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour]]'' to television and the ''[[Take It or Leave It (radio show)|Take It or Leave It]]'' to radio (which later became the ''[[$64,000 Question]]).''&lt;ref name=NYTBiowObit /&gt; In 1934, he purchased [[WBBR]] with Arde Bulova and changed the [[call letters]] to WNEW, for "the NEWest thing in radio".&lt;ref name="WNEW Name"&gt;{{cite book|title=Where the Melody Lingers On: WNEW (1934-1984)|year=1984|publisher=Nightingale Gordon|location=New York|asin=B000KYMBDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} In 1956, he disbanded his agency after the loss of several major accounts.&lt;ref name=NYTBiowObit /&gt; His firm was the starting point for many in the next generation of real estate executives including [[Norman B. Norman]].

In 1964, Biow wrote ''Butting In: An Adman Speaks Out'' which told the story of his time in advertising.&lt;ref name=NYTBiowObit /&gt; Biow and fellow Jews, [[Albert D. Lasker]] and [[Lawrence Valenstein]], are widely credited with opening the advertising industry to the next generation of [[Jewish]] advertising professionals including: [[Arthur C.

'''Nahu Senay Girma''' is an [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopian]] [[women's rights]] activist. She is the co-founder and executive director of [[African Women in Business]], a non-governmental organisation established in April 2010 to train women for leadership roles, and has established several charities.

== Career ==
Nahu Senay Girma was born in [[Mekele]].  Her father, who died at the age of 34, gave her a traditionally [[Given name#Gender|masculine name]] which translates as "something good is happening now", because he was so pleased to have a daughter.&lt;ref name="awib"/&gt;  She had three siblings, two of whom fell victim to the actions of the [[Derg]] regime.  Girma lived with her paternal grandmother in [[Addis Ababa]] until the age of 7 and then attended an all-girls boarding school. She worked abroad in Canada, the United States, and Italy before returning to Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="awib"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abdella|first1=Nejat|title=Nahu Senay Girma – Dynamism Embodied|url=http://www.awib.org.et/currency/spotlight/item/270-nahu-senay-girma-dynamism-embodied.html|publisher=African Women in Business|accessdate=3 November 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Girma works as a management consultant.&lt;ref name="awib"/&gt;  Her commissions have included  training seminars on cross-cultural working for [[IBM]], [[Scientific Atlanta]], [[Delta Airlines]], and [[BellSouth]].  She has also developed [[team building]] courses for the American government and training programmes for the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]] and [[Ethiopian Airlines]].&lt;ref name="nile"&gt;{{cite web|title=Colours of the Nile – Advisory Board|url=http://www.coloursofthenile.net/about/message-from-the-president/2-uncategorised/32-advisory_board|publisher=Colours of the Nile|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She has two children who have both been educated at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="awib"/&gt;

Girma has been very active in charity work. In [[Atlanta]], Georgia, she founded Children Services International in 2000 to work with Ethiopian high school dropouts to provide training and assist them in finding jobs. She worked with the Cleveland chapter of the [[Red Cross]]; a diversity training programme that she developed for them was piloted across the whole of the Red Cross in the USA. Girma also served on the boards of the [[Young Women's Christian Association]] (YWCA) in Marietta and an abused women's shelter in Atlanta. In Ethiopia she has served on the boards of the local branch of the YWCA and the Sara Cannizzaro Child Minders Association. She founded Addis Woubet, a project to renovate and preserve historic buildings in the Ethiopian capital, and Women for Life, which aims to reduce maternal death rates.&lt;ref name="awib"/&gt; Women for Life is currently working to upgrade the Gandhi Hospital.&lt;ref name="nile"/&gt;  Girma has personally sponsored the college education of ten children.&lt;ref name="awib"/&gt;

Girma is co-founder (with [[Roman Kifle]]) and executive director of [[African Women in Business]], a non-governmental organisation established in April 2010 to train women to become leaders in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Excellence is not about achievement; it is about character|url=http://www.ethiopianbusinessreview.net/index.php/quote/item/395-excellence-is-not-about-achievement-it-is-about-character|accessdate=16 November 2017|work=Ethiopian Business Review|date=November 2013|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AWiB selects Women of Excellence|url=http://capitalethiopia.com/2013/10/22/awib-selects-women-of-excellence/|accessdate=16 November 2017|work=Capital Ethiopia|date=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gender"/&gt;  The organisation hosts an online forum and e-learning courses to develop women as entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="gender"&gt;{{cite web|title=The coming of (digital) age: How African feminists are using the internet to change women's lives|url=https://www.genderit.org/es/node/4027|publisher=Gender IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014 she was the moderator of a discussion with young people on women's role in leadership and development organised by the [[United Nations]] Communications Group and [[Addis Ababa University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leading Ethiopian Women Dialogue with Students|url=https://unicefethiopia.org/2014/03/13/leading-ethiopian-women-dialogue-with-students/|website=UNICEF Ethiopia|accessdate=16 November 2017|date=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21271">'''New Public Management''' (NPM) is an approach to running [[public service]] organizations that is used in government and public service institutions and agencies, at both sub-national and national levels. The term was first introduced by academics in the UK and Australia &lt;ref&gt;Hood 1991 and Hood and Jackson 1991&lt;/ref&gt; to describe approaches that were developed during the 1980s as part of an effort to make the public service more "businesslike" and to improve its efficiency by using private sector management models. As with the private sector, which focuses on "[[customer service]]", NPM reforms often focused on the "...centrality of citizens who were the recipient of the services or customers to the public sector." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm | title=New Public Management Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPM reformers experimented with using decentralized service delivery models, to give local agencies more freedom in how they delivered programs or services. In some cases, NPM reforms that used [[e-government]] consolidated a program or service to a central location to reduce costs. Some governments tried using [[quasi-market]] structures, so that the public sector would have to compete against the private sector (notably in the UK, in [[health care]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm | title=New Public Management Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key themes in NPM were "...financial control, value for money, increasing efficiency...,identifying and setting targets and continuance monitoring of performance, handing over.. power to the senior management" [[Senior management|executives]]. Performance was assessed with audits, benchmarks and performance evaluations. Some NPM reforms used private sector companies to deliver what were formerly public services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm | title=New Public Management Model}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NPM advocates in some countries worked to remove "...collective agreements [in favour of]...individual rewards packages at senior levels combined with short term contracts" and introduce private sector-style [[corporate governance]], including using a [[Board of Directors]] approach to strategic guidance for public organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm | title=New Public Management Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; While NPM approaches have been used in many countries around the world, NPM is particularly associated with the most industrialized [[OECD]] nations such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and the [[United States of America]]. NPM advocates focus on using approaches from the private sector–the [[corporation|corporate]] or business world–which can be successfully applied in the public sector and in a [[public administration]] context. NPM approaches have been used to reform the public sector, its policies and its programs. NPM advocates claim that it is a more efficient and effective means of attaining the same outcome. 

In NPM, citizens are viewed as "customers" and public servants are viewed as public managers. NPM tries to realign the relationship between public service managers and their political superiors by making a parallel relationship between the two. Under NPM, public managers have incentive-based motivation such as pay-for-performance, and clear performance targets are often set, which are assessed by using [[performance evaluation]]s. As well, managers in an NPM paradigm may have greater discretion and freedom as to how they go about achieving the goals set for them. This NPM approach is contrasted with the traditional [[public administration]] model, in which institutional decision-making, policy-making and public service delivery is guided by regulations, legislation and [[administrative law|administrative procedures]]. 

NPM reforms use approaches such as disaggregation, customer satisfaction initiatives, [[customer service]] efforts, applying an [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial spirit]] to public service, and [[innovation|introducing innovations]]. The NPM system allows "the expert manager to have a greater discretion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farazmand|first1=Ali|title=New Public Management|journal=Handbook of Globalization, Governance, and Public Administration|date=Feb 2, 2006|pages=888}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barzelay|title=The New Public Management: Improving Research and Policy Dialogue|date=2001|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Public Managers under the New Public Management reforms can provide a range of choices from which customers can choose, including the right to opt out of the service delivery system completely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaboolian|first1=Linda|title=The New Public Management: Challenging the Boundaries of the Management vs. Administration Debate|date=1998|publisher=Public Administration Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first practices of New Public Management emerged in the United Kingdom under the leadership of Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Thatcher played the functional role of “policy entrepreneur" and the official role of prime minister.{{fact|date=November 2016}} Thatcher drove changes in public management policy in such areas as organizational methods, civil service, labor relations, expenditure planning, financial management, audit, evaluation, and procurement. Thatcher's successor, [[John Major]], kept public management policy on the agenda of the Conservative government, leading to the implementation of the Next Steps Initiative. Major also launched the programs of the Citizens Charter Initiative, Competing for Quality, Resource Accounting and Budgeting, and the Private Finance Initiative.

A term was coined in the late 1980s to denote a new (or renewed) focus on the importance of management and ‘production engineering’ in public service delivery, which often linked to doctrines of economic rationalism (Hood 1989, Pollitt 1993). During this timeframe public management became an active area of policy-making in numerous other countries, notably in New Zealand, Australia, and Sweden.  At the same time, [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ]] (OECD) established its Public Management Committee and Secretariat (PUMA), conferring to public management the status normally accorded more conventional domains of policy. In the 1990s, public management was a major item on President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]]’s agenda. Early policy actions of the Clinton administration included launching the [[National Partnership for Reinventing Government|National Partnership]] and signing into law the [[Government Performance and Results Act]]. Currently there are few indications that public management issues will vanish from governmental policy agendas. A recent study showed that in Italy, municipal directors are aware of a public administration now being oriented toward new public management where they are assessed according to the results they produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marozzi|first1=Marco|last2=Bolzan|first2=Mario|title=Skills and training requirements of municipal directors: A statistical assessment|journal=Quality and Quantity|volume=50|issue=3|pages=1093–1115|date=2015|doi=10.1007/s11135-015-0192-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term New Public Management (NPM) expresses the idea that the cumulative flow of policy decisions over the past twenty years has amounted to a substantial shift in the governance and management of the “state sector” in the [[United Kingdom]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Scandinavia]], and [[North America]]. A benign interpretation is that these decisions have been a defensible, if imperfect, response to policy problems. Those problems as well as their solutions were formulated within the policy-making process. The agenda-setting process has been heavily influenced by electoral commitments to improve macro- economic performance and to contain growth in the public sector, as well as by a growing perception of public bureaucracies as being inefficient. The alternative-generation process has been heavily influenced by ideas coming from economics and from various quarters within the field of management.

== Globalization ==
Although the origins of NPM came from Westernized countries it expanded to a variety of other countries in the 1990s. Before the 1990s, NPM was largely associated to an idea utilized by developed countries that are particularly Anglo-Saxon. However the 1990s have seen countries in Africa, Asia and other countries looking into using this method. In Africa, downsizing and decrease of user fees have been widely introduced. These autonomous agencies within the public sectors have been established in these areas. Performance contracting became a common policy in crisis states worldwide. Contracting out of this magnitude can be used to do things such as waste management, cleaning, laundry, catering and road maintenance.

== Aspects  ==

NPM was accepted as the "gold standard for administrative reform"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farazmand|first1=Ali|title=New Public Management: Theory, Ideology, and Practice|journal=Handbook of Globalization, Governance and Public Administration|date=Jan 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1990s. The idea for using this method for government reform was that if the government guided private-sector principles were used rather than rigid hierarchical bureaucracy, it would work more efficiently. NPM promotes a shift from bureaucratic administration to business-like professional management. NPM was cited as the solution for management ills in various organizational context and policy making in education and health care reform.

The basic principles of NPM is can best be described when split into seven different aspects elaborated by Christopher Hood in 1991. Hood also invented the term NPM itself. &lt;ref&gt;in "A Public Management for all seasons?", Public Administration Review, Voæl 69, Spring1991 (3-19).&lt;/ref&gt; They are the following:

=== Management ===
Because of its belief in the importance and strength of privatizing government, it is critical to have an emphasis on management by engaging in hands-on methods. This theory allows leaders the freedom to manage freely and open up discretion.

=== Performance standards ===
Its important to maintain explicit standards and measures of performance in a workforce. Using this method promotes clarification of goals/intent, targets, and indicators for progression.

=== Output controls ===
The third point acknowledges the "shift from the use of input controls and bureaucratic procedures to rules relying on output controls measured by quantitive performance indicators".&lt;ref&gt;Yamaoto, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect requires using performance based assessments when looking to outsource work to private companies/groups.

=== Decentralization ===
NPM advocates often shifted from a unified management system to a decentralized system in which managers gain flexibility and are not limited to agency restrictions.

=== Competition ===
This characteristic focuses on how NPM can promote competition in the public sector which could in turn lower cost, eliminate debate and possibly achieve a higher quality of progress/work through the term contacts. Competition can also be found when the government offers contracts to the private sectors and the contract is given in terms of the ability to deliver the service effectively, quality of the goods provided, hence this will increase competition because the other private sector which did not get the contract will make strides to improve the quality and ability thereby facilitating competition.

=== Private-sector management ===
This aspect focuses on the necessity to establish short-term labor contracts, develop corporate plans or [[business plan]]s, performance agreements and [[mission statement]]s. It also focuses on establishing a workplace in which public employees or contractors are aware of the goals and intention that agencies are trying to reach.

=== Cost reduction ===
The most effective one which has led to its ascent into global popularity, focuses on keeping cost low and efficiency high. "Doing more with less" &lt;ref&gt;Hood, 1991: 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;
moreover cost reduction stimulates efficiency and is one way which makes it different from the traditional approach of management&lt;ref&gt;Deffy, 1999:67-78&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences between public and private sectors ==
New Public Management draws practices from the private sector and uses them in the public sector of management. NPM reforms use market forces to hold the public sector accountable and the satisfaction of preferences as the measures of accountability.  In order for this system to proceed, certain conditions, such as the existence of competition, must exist and information about choices must be available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaboolian|first1=Linda|title=The New Public Management: Challenging the Boundaries of the Management vs. Administration Debate|date=1998|publisher=Public Administration Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reforms that promise to reinvent government by way of focusing on results and customer satisfaction as opposed to administrative and political processes fail to account for legislative self-interest. Institutions other than federal government, the changes being trumpeted as reinvention would not even be announced, except perhaps on hallway bulletin boards.

== Issues ==

===Criticisms===
There are blurred lines between policymaking and providing services in the New Public Management system. Questions have been raised about the potential politicization of the public service, when executives are hired on contract under pay-for-performance systems.  There are concerns that public managers may move away from trying to meet citizens' needs. NPM brings to question integrity and compliance when dealing with incentives for public managers. Questions such as managers being more or less faithful arise. The public interest is at risk and could undermine the trust in government. Accountability can be a big issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barzelay|title=The New Public Management: Improving Research and Policy Dialogue|date=2001|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relevance  ====

Although NPM had a dramatic impact in the 1990s on managing and policymaking, many scholars believe that NPM has hit its prime. Scholars like Frank Dunleavy believe New Public Management is phasing out because of disconnect with “customers” and their institutions. Scholars cite the Digital Era and the new importance of technology that kills the necessity of NPM. In countries that are less industrialized the NPM concept is still growing and spreading. This trend has much to do with a country's ability or inability to get their public sector in tune with the Digital Era. New Public Management was created in the Public Sector to create change based on: disaggregation, competition, and incentives. Using incentives to produce the maximum services from an organization is largely stalled in many countries and being reversed because of increased complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunleavy|title=New Public Management Is Dead--Long Live Digital-Era Governance|date=2005|publisher=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternatives===
Post-NPM, many countries explored [[digital era governance]] (DEG). Dunleavy believes this new way of governance should be heavily centered upon information and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunleavy|title=New Public Management Is Dead--Long Live Digital-Era Governance|date=2005|publisher=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology will help re-integrate with digitalization changes. Digital Era Governance provides a unique opportunity for self- sustainability however, there are various factors that will determine whether or not DEG can be implemented successfully. When countries have proper technology, NPM simply can't compete very well with DEG. DEG does an excellent job of making services more accurate, prompt and remove most barriers and conflicts. DEG also can improve the service quality and provide local access to outsourcers.

===Comparisons to New Public Administration===

New Public Management is often mistakingly compared to [[New Public Administration]]. The ‘New Public Administration’ movement was one established in the USA during the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pfiffner|first1=James|title=Public Administration versus The New Public Management|url=http://pfiffner.gmu.edu/files/pdfs/Book_Chapters/NewPublicMgt.doc.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there may be some common features, the central themes of the two movements are different. The main thrust of the New Public Administration movement was to bring academic public administration into line with a radical egalitarian agenda that was influential in US university campuses. By contrast, the emphasis of the New Public Management movement a decade or so later was firmly managerial in the sense that it stressed the difference that management could and should make the quality and efficiency of public services. It focuses on public service production functions and operational issues contrasted with the focus on public accountability, ‘model employer’ public service values, ‘due process,’ and what happens inside public organizations in conventional public administration. That meant New Public Management doctrines tended to be opposed to egalitarian ideas of managing without managers, juridical doctrines of rigidly rule-bound administration and doctrines of self-government by public-service professionals like teachers and doctors.

'''Pre-packaged insolvency''' (a "pre-pack") is a kind of [[bankruptcy]] procedure, where a restructure plan is agreed in advance of a company declaring its insolvency. In the [[United States]] pre-packs are often used in a [[Chapter 11]] filing. In the [[United Kingdom]], pre-packs have become popular since the [[Enterprise Act 2002]], which has made [[Administration (law)|administration]] the dominant insolvency procedure. Such arrangements are also available in [[Canada]] under the [[Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act]].

==United Kingdom==
{{see also|UK insolvency law}}
The term "pre-pack sale" has been defined by the Association of Business Recovery Professionals as, "an arrangement under which the sale of all or part of a company’s business or assets is negotiated with a purchaser prior to the appointment of an administrator, and the administrator effects the sale immediately on, or shortly after, his appointment".&lt;ref name="r3.org.uk"&gt;http://www.r3.org.uk/media/documents/technical_library/SIPS/SIP%2016%20E&amp;W.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The difference between a pre-pack sale and a normal sale is that in a normal sale the administrator markets the business and negotiates the terms of the sale after his appointment.

The reasons an administrator sells on a [[pre-pack]] basis, rather than after post-appointment marketing, vary from case to case, but they often involve the following considerations. A pre-pack sale avoids the costs of trading (which means creditors receive more back), and indeed, the company and the administrator may not have the funds to trade. It also avoids the administrator taking on the risks associated with trading. The value of the business may deteriorate during administration trading.

There may be other factors to prevent trading, such as regulatory problems.&lt;ref&gt;see, for example, Re DKLL Solicitors [2007] EWHC 2067 (Ch), http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2007/2067.html for consideration of these issues&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts have held that an administrator can sell the company's assets immediately upon his appointment, without court approval or the approval of the creditors,&lt;ref&gt;Re T&amp;D Industries Plc [2000] 1 WLR 646; Re Transbus International Limited [2004] 1 WLR 2654&lt;/ref&gt; and he can do so even if the majority creditor objects.&lt;ref&gt;Re DKLL Solicitors [2007] EWHC 2067 (Ch), http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2007/2067.html&lt;/ref&gt; Courts have even approved transactions that, as a "necessary evil", have made payments to the former management while leaving little or nothing to [[unsecured creditor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Re [[Halliwells LLP]] [2010] EWHC 2036 (Ch) at para 20 http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2010/2036.html&amp;query=halliwells+and+LLP&amp;method=boolean&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, the Association of Business Recovery Professionals issued ''Statement of Insolvency Practice 16''&lt;ref name="r3.org.uk"/&gt; to require insolvency practitioners acting as administrators to disclose a number of matters to all creditors as soon as possible after the completion of the sale. This was done in an attempt to provide greater transparency to creditors.

On 1 November 2013, following a government-commissioned review, a new ''Statement of Insolvency Practice 16'' was introduced. It requires administrators to disclose the following:&lt;ref&gt;http://lucasjohnson.co.uk/statement-of-insolvency-practice-16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*The source of the administrator’s initial introduction and the date of the introduction
*The extent of the administrator’s involvement prior to appointment
*The alternative courses of action that were considered by the administrator, with an explanation of possible financial outcomes
*Whether efforts were made to consult with major creditors
*Why it was not appropriate to trade the business and offer it for sale as a going concern, during the administration
*Details of requests made to potential funders to fund working capital requirements
*Details of registered charges and dates of creation
*If the business or business assets have been acquired from an insolvency practitioner within the previous 24 months, or longer if the administrator deems that relevant to creditors’ understanding, the administrator should disclose both the details of that transaction and whether the administrator, administrator’s firm or associates were involved
*Any marketing activities conducted by the company and/or the administrator and the outcome of those activities
*The names and professional qualifications of any valuers and confirmation they have confirmed their independence
*Any valuations obtained of the business or the underlying assets
*A summary of the basis of the valuation adopted by the administrator or his valuers/advisers
*The rationale for the basis of the valuations obtained and an explanation of the sale of the assets compared to those valuations.  If no valuation has been obtained, the reason for not having done so and how the administrator was satisfied as to the value of the assets
*The date of the transaction
*The identity of the purchaser
*Any connection between the purchaser and the directors, shareholders or secured creditors of the company or their associates
*The names of any directors, or former directors, of the company who are involved in the management or ownership of the purchaser, or of any other entity into which any of the assets are transferred
*In transactions impacting on more than one related company (e.g. a group transaction) the administrator should ensure that the disclosure is sufficient to enable a transparent explanation (for instance, allocation of consideration paid)
*Whether any directors had given guarantees for amounts due from the company to a prior financier, and whether that financier is financing the new business
*Details of the assets involved and the nature of the transaction
*The consideration for the transaction, terms of payment, and any condition of the contract that could materially affect the consideration
*Sale consideration disclosed under broad asset valuation categories and split between fixed and floating charge realisations
*Any options, buy-back arrangements or similar conditions attached to the contract of sale
*If the sale is part of a wider transaction, a description of the other aspects of the transaction.

The main benefit of a pre-pack administration is the 'continuity' of the business - the company is protected by the court. This gets rid of debts and contracts. It does not get rid of employees due to the [[Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006]] (TUPE).  Another big advantage is that the cost of the process is lower than trading administration, as the administrators do not need to find funding to trade the business. The downside of a pre-pack administration is that it can attract negative publicity if the former directors are seen to be shedding liabilities.

The [[Insolvency Service]] monitors compliance with SIP 16.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bis.gov.uk/insolvency/insolvency-profession/regulation/statements-of-insolvency-practice/sip-16-reports-pre-packs&lt;/ref&gt; Its reports show that in 2010 it reported 10 insolvency practitioners to their licensing bodies, and in 2011 it reported 21.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/2174788/21-ips-reported-compliance-pre-packs-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, typically the term ''pre-packaged insolvency'' is recoined as '''pre-packaged bankruptcy'''.  A conventional bankruptcy case is one in which the debtor files for Chapter 11 relief without having agreed in advance to the terms of a plan of reorganization with its creditors. During the course of the Chapter 11 case, the debtor or, if the debtor does not retain the exclusive right to propose a plan, a creditor or creditor group may formulate and propose a plan of reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pros And Cons Of Prepackaged Bankruptcy|url=http://www.stblaw.com/docs/default-source/cold-fusion-existing-content/publications/pub1647.pdf?sfvrsn=2|publisher=Law 360|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A company undergoing Chapter 11 reorganization is effectively operating under the ''protection'' of the court until it emerges. An example is the [[airline industry]]; in 2006, over half the industry's [[seating capacity]] was on airlines that were in Chapter 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Delta and Northwest airlines both file for bankruptcy | url = http://money.cnn.com/2005/09/14/news/fortune500/bankruptcy_airlines/ | accessdate = November 17, 2005 | work=CNN | date=2005-09-14 | first1=Chris | last1=Isidore | first2=/Money | last2=Senior}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pre-packaged case, the plan proponents will have secured sufficient support from creditors to confirm their plan of reorganization prior to filing for Chapter 11 reorganization. Pre-packaged plans of reorganization virtually always impair (i.e. pay less than in full) one or more classes of creditors, and so in order to ensure that the plan can be confirmed by the bankruptcy court, the plan proponents must secure the support of at least two-thirds in amount and more than one-half in number of at least one such impaired class, in addition to ensuring the plan complies with all other requirements for confirmation. Two procedurally difficult aspects of the process are the announcement (which must be structured so as not to trigger contractual termination provisions) and getting the requisite creditor approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law360.com/bankruptcy/articles/820493|title=3 Tips For Acing A Prepackaged Ch. 11 - Law360|website=www.law360.com|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a new entity completed the purchase of continuing operations, assets and trademarks of [[General Motors]] as a part of the 'pre-packaged' [[Chapter 11]] reorganization.&lt;ref name=Stoll&gt;Stoll, John D., and Neil King Jr. (July 10, 2009).[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124722154897622577 GM Emerges From Bankruptcy].''The Wall Street Journal''.

==Criticism==
A review from [[Wolverhampton University]] identified the several criticisms of pre-pack sales.  There is a general concern that the pre-pack administrator, in agreeing to the pre-pack in consultation with the company’s management team (and usually its secured creditors), favours the interests of the managers and secured creditors ahead of those of the unsecured creditors.  The speed and secrecy of the transaction often lead to a deal being executed, about which the unsecured creditors know nothing and offers them little or no return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wellard|first1=Mark|last2=Walton|first2=Peter|title=A Comparative Analysis of Anglo-Australian Pre-packs: Can the Means Be Made to Justify the Ends?|journal=International Insolvency Review|date=26 Sep 2012|volume=21|issue=3|pages=143–181|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/iir.1201/abstract|accessdate=28 July 2014|doi=10.1002/iir.1201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is often a suspicion that the consideration paid for the business may not have been maximized due to the absence of [[open market]]ing. Credit may have been incurred inappropriately prior to the pre-pack and this may not be fully investigated.&lt;ref&gt;"When is pre-packaged administration appropriate?"http://www.ntu.ac.uk/nls/document_uploads/112698.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Criticism of this nature had been levelled at pre-pack sales by John Moulton of [[Alchemy Partners]] in January 2009, saying 'Pre-packs could be very easily abused. Bad management can plan for a prepack months in advance, line up an administrator – and then be back running the business immediately. It means when retailers fail they are often being kept with the same directors when it would be much healthier if new management arrived and with fresh money to invest".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/article-1104725/Pre-pack-deals-risk-cheating-creditors-Private-equity-boss-warns-abuse-quickie-bankruptcy.html#ixzz0rDL91vtB&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Individualism sidebar}}
'''Rational egoism''' (also called '''rational selfishness''') is the principle that an action is rational if and only if it maximizes one's self-interest.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Baier (1990), p. 201; Gert (1998), p. 69; Shaver (2002), §3; Moseley (2006), §2.&lt;/ref&gt; The view is a [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] form of [[wikt:egoism|egoism]]. It is distinct from [[psychological egoism]] (according to which people are ''motivated'' only to act in their own self-interest) and [[ethical egoism]] (that moral agents ''ought'' only to do what is in their own self-interest).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Rational egoism was embodied by Russian author [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]] in the 1863 book ''[[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|What Is to Be Done?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrzej Walicki|author2=Hilda Andrews-Rusiecka|title=A History of Russian Thought: From the Enlightenment to Marxism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ev4ad5wKI9oC&amp;pg=PA196|year=1979|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1132-6|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chernyshevsky's standpoint was ultimately socialistic, and was criticised by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] in the 1864 book ''[[Notes from Underground]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Case against Rational Egoism in Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground |author=James P. Scanlan |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=60 |issue=3 |date=July 1999 |pages=549–67 |doi=10.1353/jhi.1999.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/underground/context.html |title=SparkNotes: Notes from Underground: Context |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=[[SparkNotes]] |publisher= |access-date=2015-05-30 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]] discussed rational egoism in his book ''[[The Methods of Ethics]]'', first published in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907)&lt;/ref&gt; A method of ethics is "any rational procedure by which we determine what individual human beings 'ought' – or what it is 'right' for them – to do, or seek to realize by voluntary action".&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Sidgwick considers three such procedures, namely, rational egoism, dogmatic intuitionism, and [[utilitarianism]]. Rational egoism is the view that, if rational, "an agent regards quantity of consequent pleasure and pain to himself alone important in choosing between alternatives of action; and seeks always the greatest attainable surplus of pleasure over pain".&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Sidgwick found it difficult to find any persuasive reason for preferring rational egoism over [[utilitarianism]]. Although utilitarianism can be provided with a rational basis and reconciled with the morality of common sense, rational egoism appears to be an equally plausible doctrine regarding what we have most reason to do. Thus we must "admit an ultimate and fundamental contradiction in our apparent intuitions of what is Reasonable in conduct; and from this admission it would seem to follow that the apparently intuitive operation of Practical Reason, manifested in these contradictory judgments, is after all illusory".&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick (1907), p. 508&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ayn Rand ==
The author and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] also discusses a theory that she called 'rational egoism'. She holds that it is both irrational and immoral to act against one's self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2006); Moseley (2006), §2a.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, her view is a conjunction of both rational egoism (in the standard sense) and [[ethical egoism]], because according to [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist philosophy]], egoism cannot be properly justified without an [[epistemology]] based on [[rationality|reason]]:

Her book ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness]]'' (1964) explains the concept of rational egoism in depth. According to Rand, a rational man holds his own life as his highest value, rationality as his highest [[virtue]], and his happiness as the final purpose of his life.

Conversely, Rand was sharply critical of the [[ethical altruism|ethical doctrine of altruism]]:

{{quote|Do not confuse altruism with kindness, good will or respect for the rights of others. These are not primaries, but consequences, which, in fact, altruism makes impossible. The irreducible primary of altruism, the basic absolute is ''self-sacrifice'' – which means self-immolation, self-abnegation, self-denial self-destruction – which means the ''self'' as a standard of evil, the ''selfless'' as a standard of the good.
Do not hide behind such superficialities as whether you should or should not give a dime to a beggar. This is not the issue. The issue is whether you ''do'' or do ''not'' have the right to exist ''without'' giving him that dime. The issue is whether you must keep buying your life, dime by dime, from any beggar who might choose to approach you. The issue is whether the need of others is the first mortgage on your life and the moral purpose of your existence. The issue is whether man is to be regarded as a sacrificial animal. Any man of self-esteem will answer: ''No.'' Altruism says: ''Yes.''"&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand, "Faith and Force: Destroyers of the Modern World," ''Philosophy: Who Needs it'', 1982, New American Library, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticism==
Two objections to rational egoism are given by the English philosopher [[Derek Parfit]], who discusses the theory at length in ''[[Reasons and Persons]]'' (1984).&lt;ref&gt;D. Parfit (1984), parts II and III&lt;/ref&gt; First, from the rational egoist point of view, it is rational to contribute to a [[pension scheme]] now, even though this is detrimental to one's present interests (which are to spend the money now). But it seems equally reasonable to maximize one's interests now, given that one's reasons are not only relative to him, but to him as he is now (and not his future self, who is argued to be a "different" person). Parfit also argues that since the connections between the present mental state and the mental state of one's future self may decrease, it is not plausible to claim that one should be indifferent between one's present and future self.

The "[[Gene-centered view of evolution|selfish gene]]" model of [[evolution]] suggests that human (and animal) behaviors that seem altruistic are actually selfish, if viewed from the perspective of [[Gene|genes]]/[[Phenotype|phenotypes]].  People help each other "selflessly" because copies of their own genes also exist in others, so behaviors that help the genes survive are [[Natural selection|selected]] for, with the altruistic drive [[Kin selection|decreasing with genetic distance]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16546">'''Say on pay''' is a term used for a role in [[corporate law]] whereby a firm's shareholders have the right to vote on the [[remuneration]] of executives.

Often described in [[corporate governance]] or management theory as an [[agency problem]], a corporation's managers are likely to overpay themselves because, directly or indirectly, they are allowed to pay themselves as a matter of general management power.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in the UK, see [[Model Articles]] para 3; and under the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]], see s 141(a)&lt;/ref&gt; Directors are elected to a board that has a [[Fiduciary|fiduciary duty]] to protect the interests of the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in the UK, [[Companies Act 2006]], ss 170, 172&lt;/ref&gt; In large listed companies, executive compensation will usually be determined by a compensation committee composed of board members.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in the UK, see the [[Combined Code]] A.3.1; in the US, see the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) rules; in Germany see the [[German Corporate Governance Codex]]&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents argue that “say on pay” reforms strengthen the relationship between the [[board of directors]] and shareholders, ensuring that board members fulfill their fiduciary duty. [http://millstein.som.yale.edu/Davis_Say_on_Pay_Policy_Briefing.pdf] Critics of the policy believe that “say on pay” does not effectively or comprehensibly monitor compensation, and consider it to be reactionary policy rather than proactive policy, because it does not immediately affect the Board of Directors. Some argue it is counter-productive because it diminishes the authority of the Board of Directors. [http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/11485334/2/c_2984789] The effect of ‘say on pay’ measures can be binding or non-binding, depending on regulatory requirements or internal corporate policy as determined by proxy votes.&lt;ref&gt;David Orisson, '[http://www.leadingboards.com/blog/say-on-pay-new-tool-of-social-responsibility/ Say On Pay = New tool of Social Responsibility?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823072522/http://www.leadingboards.com/blog/say-on-pay-new-tool-of-social-responsibility/ |date=2013-08-23 }}'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Switzerland==
{{main|Swiss referendum "against corporate Rip-offs" of 2013}}

On the 3rd of March the Swiss voted by 69.7 per cent to ensure shareholders, pension funds and not banks, entirely control questions of executive pay. Shareholders must elect all members of a company's remuneration committee of all Swiss public listed companies. They further should receive annual votes on the identity of all members of the [[board of directors]]. The role that banks played in casting votes on other shareholders behalf has been abolished.

==Australia==
The [[Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Act 2011]] introduced in the [[Corporations Act 2001]] new sections 250R(2), 250U-V, so that if at two consecutive meetings over 25% of shareholders vote against the directors’ remuneration package, the directors have to stand for election again in 90 days.

==UK law==
{{see also|UK company law}}
Originally [[UK company law]] set a default rule that the remuneration of directors was to be set, binding, by the company's general meeting, under [[Table A]], article 54, attached to the [[Companies Act 1862]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/about/tableA/comm7Aug1862CoAct1862_P1.pdf Table A of the CA 1862 art 54]&lt;/ref&gt; Over time more and more companies gave the right to directors, which is the position found in the [[Model Articles]] for companies today, that remuneration of the directors shall be determined by the directors.

The United Kingdom was the forerunner in mandating that shareholders be allowed a ''non-binding'', or advisory vote on pay. In the UK, section 439 of the [[Companies Act 2006]] mandates a vote on director pay at the yearly accounts meeting. Directors are expected to have disclosed their remuneration package in a "Remuneration Report" (section 420). Failure to do this leads to fines.

In addition, UK law regulates more tightly a number of elements beyond basic director pay. Employee share schemes that directors have must be approved by ordinary resolution under the [[London Stock Exchange]] Listing Rule 9.4.1. Under the [[UK Corporate Governance Code]], with which all listed companies must comply or explain why they do not, a binding vote on approval of [[long-term incentive plan]]s is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;Combined Code B.2.4&lt;/ref&gt; Under section 188 of the Companies Act 2006 a [[shareholder resolution]] is necessary to approve a director’s contract lasting more than a 2-year term (reduced from approval beyond a 5-year term under the old Companies Act 1985, section 319). Lastly, frivolous categories of compensation are limited under section 215, by prohibiting payments for loss of office (i.e. no [[golden parachutes]]), except, under section 220, in respect of damages for existing obligations and pensions.

Although the say on pay provision in section 439 is not binding on the board, the message in UK law is influential, because company members have an unrestricted right to fire any director, with reasonable notice, under section 168. The debate, however, moved on to whether the vote should become binding.&lt;ref&gt;T Helm and R Wachman, '[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/07/david-cameron-fat-cat-pay David Cameron to curb 'fat cat' pay with people power]' (8 January 2012) The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; Changes were introduced in the [[Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013]] section 79 to make the overall policy of pay be capable of being rejected by shareholders, but that no specific right to determine the amount has yet been introduced.

==US law==
{{see also|United States corporate law}}
In the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] §951, a new say on pay provision was introduced. 

There had been several recent efforts to require Say on Pay resolutions in the United States. In 2007, the Chairman of the Financial Services Committee Rep. [[Barney Frank]] sponsored legislation that was passed by the House of Representatives, giving shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation. [http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/8946280?f=related] Then Senator [[Barack Obama]] authored a "Say on Pay" proposal, but his legislation stalled in the Senate. [http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/11037327/c_11036422] 

The economic crisis has affected corporate governance in the United States of America. The [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] (EESA), which established the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]], required say on pay resolutions at companies with outstanding funds from the TARP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonwatch.com/blog/2008/09/28/bailout-text-tarp-taxpayers-are-really-payin/]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], Senator [[Chris Dodd]] amended Section 111 of the EESA, and updated policy on Executive Compensation in Section 7. The amended legislation continued the "Say on Pay" policy established originally in the EESA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h1enr.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 2009, Treasury Secretary [[Timothy Geithner]] stated that companies that have received exceptional financial recovery assistance from the TARP fund would have to subject executive compensation to "Say on Pay" resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/tg15.htm U.S. Treasury News Release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530151237/https://treas.gov/press/releases/tg15.htm |date=2009-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 10, 2009, Secretary Geithner stated that the Administration supports "Say on Pay" legislation, and it would authorize the SEC authority to implement "Say on Pay" regulations at all companies, not only those that have outstanding funds from the TARP, contingent on Congressional approval.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/jun2009/db20090610_656281.htm?campaign_id=rss_daily Business Week June 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Treasury reconciled its proposals from February 4 with Congressional amendments to the EESA in the Final Interim Rule on TARP Standards for Compensation and Corporate Governance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasury.gov/press/releases/tg165.htm U.S. Treasury News Release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610213259/http://www.treasury.gov/press/releases/tg165.htm |date=2009-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 31, 2009, H.R. 3269, the "Corporate and Financial Institution Compensation Fairness Act of 2009" passed the House of Representatives. The House bill included a section that allowed for a 'say on pay' for all public institutions in the United States. Additionally, it had a provision for a shareholder vote on golden parachutes. In the Senate, Senator Charles Schumer had introduced the Shareholder Bill of Rights. The House and Senate bills were reconciled in a final bill that was signed by President Obama on July 21, 2010 called The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, only 2.6% of companies which voted on say on pay measures failed to pass them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semlerbrossy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/SBCG-SOP-2012-09-05.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329001924/http://www.semlerbrossy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/SBCG-SOP-2012-09-05.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EU proposals==
{{see also|EU company law}}
The [[European Union]] has remained tentative about harmonising rules on CEO pay. In the High Level Group of Company Law Experts' ''Final Report'' in 2002, they stated they would not wish to impose a requirement for voting EU wide, yet.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Some Member States require, or are considering requiring, a form of mandatory or advisory vote by 
shareholders on the remuneration policy.  We do not believe a shareholder vote on the remuneration policy generally should be an 
EU requirement, as the effects of such a vote can be different from Member State to Member State.  The important thing is that 
shareholders annually have the opportunity to debate the policy with the board.&lt;ref&gt;High Level Group of Company Law Experts, [http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/company/docs/modern/report_en.pdf ''Final Report''] (2002) p.65; from the EU Commission's [http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/company/modern/index_en.htm#background website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212120815/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/company/modern/index_en.htm#background |date=2008-02-12 }} on company law modernisation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, a different approach is taken to share schemes, which were recommended to be more closely scrutinised.

==German reforms==
{{Expand section|date=October 2009}}
The Coalition Government of Germany has recently passed reforming legislation to the [[Stock Corporation Act]] to introduce a non-binding say on pay.

==Examples of shareholder revolts==
Incidents at large UK companies in which shareholders have "revolted" against the size of pay awards given to board members, since the "say on pay" legislation was introduced.

*[[Vodafone]] shareholders voted 10% against, and 30% in abstention from £13m in shares for CEO Sir Chris Gent. (July 2001)
*[[Royal &amp; Sun Alliance]] shareholders voted 28% against a £250,000 retention bonus for CFO Julian Hance and £1.44m severance pay for CEO Bob Mendelsohn. The share price had just dropped. (May 2003)
*[[GlaxoSmithKline]] shareholders voted 50.72% (advisorily) against a £22m bonus salary and stock [[severance package]] for CEO [[Jean-Pierre Garnier]]. Chairman Sir Christopher Hogg said it was just the difference in culture to the US that was holding Britain back and they should accept it. The TUC had been lobbying pension funds. (May 2003)
*[[ITV Network|ITV]] shareholders were 40% against a £15m (£1.8m cash, rest shares) payoff to Chairman Michael Green. It was justified on the basis that he would have taken legal action were it not paid, because he was removed prior to the Carlton/Granada merger.
*[[Berkley (property company)|Berkley]] Managing Director and founder of the property company had 47% of shareholders vote against his £1.2m (out of a total £4.7m package) under a long term incentive scheme that he had not actually belonged to. (August 2003)
*[[Unilever]] Former chairman Niall Fitzgerald got £1.2m after profits fell. (April 2005)
*[[Tesco]] shareholders voted 15% against an £11.5m bonus on [[Sir Terry Leahy]]’s salary as CEO. It was linked to the success of the firm's Fresh &amp; Easy chain in the US. The [[Association of British Insurers]] and [[Pensions &amp; Investment Research Consultants Ltd|PIRC]] were against.

In the first year of mandatory shareholder advisory "say on pay" voting in the US, 37 Russell 3000 companies failed to receive majority support from shareholders.  In the second year of voting, 44 Russell 3000 companies have failed as of June 12, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semlerbrossy.com/sop/four-more-companies-fail-say-on-pay#.T9eCpbX-tBk Four more companies fail Say on Pay], Semler Brossy Consulting Group, June 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semlerbrossy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/SBCG-SOP-2012-06-06.pdf 2012 Say on Pay Results (as of June 6)]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Semler Brossy Consulting Group, June 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Companies include:

*[[Nabors Industries]] shareholders voted against "say on pay" in both 2011 and 2012 (75% opposition in 2012) given concerns over the company's high CEO pay and severance payments.  Shareholders also voted against the company's new incentive bonus plan and long-term incentive plan in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/06/nabors-severance-idUSL1E8H6IXJ20120606 Nabors owners reject exec pay, want severance nod], Reuters, June 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Hewlett Packard]] failed a "say on pay" vote in 2011 in light of new CEO [[Léo Apotheker]]'s employment agreement and the company's stock performance.
*[[Citigroup]] failed "say on pay" with 55% opposition in 2012 after giving CEO [[Vikram Pandit]] three retention grants valued at $27.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semlerbrossy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SBCG-SOP-2012-04-251.pdf 2012 Say on Pay Results (as of April 25)]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Semler Brossy Consulting Group, April 25, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic skepticism==
[[Brian Cheffins]] of [[Cambridge University]] and [[Randall Thomas]] of [[Vanderbilt University]] predicted that a 'say on pay' could hold back sudden jumps, but it would not stop the general upward drift in pay rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=268992]&lt;/ref&gt;  Ryan Krause and colleagues argued that 'say on pay' offered little information to the board of directors beyond disapproval of CEO compensation not being in line with firm performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krause|first=Ryan|last2=Whitler|first2=Kimberly A.|last3=Semadeni|first3=Matthew|date=2014-02-01|title=Power to the Principals!

'''Seán Dunne''' (born 1954) is an Irish businessman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/sean-dunne-locks-chawke-out-of-d4-bar-1462171.html|title=Sean Dunne locks Chawke out of D4 bar|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=24 August 2008|accessdate=4 January 2009|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and property developer.

In a rare interview, given to the U.S. paper ''The International Herald Tribune'' in January 2009, Seán Dunne commented "if the banking crisis continues I could be considered insolvent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribune.ie/archive/article/2009/jan/04/sean-dunne-i-could-be-considered-insolvent/ |title=Sean Dunne: 'I could be considered insolvent' |work=[[The Irish Tribune]] |date=4 January 2009 |accessdate=21 November 2010 |last= |first=}}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

As of November 2010, Seán Dunne faces difficulties regarding a multi-million dollar property in an exclusive estate in Greenwich, Connecticut; US officials have ordered work on the property to cease as the owners have exceeded the scope of their planning permission. Sean Dunne publicly denies any claim to the property in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2010/1120/1224283770522.html |title=US officials order work to stop on Seán Dunne's $2m house |work=[[The Irish Times]] |date=20 November 2010 |accessdate=21 November 2010 |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129025737/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2010/1120/1224283770522.html |archivedate=29 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2010/1120/1224283770522.html |title=Another leafy suburb, another planning problem for Dunne |work=[[The Irish Times]] |date=20 November 2010 |accessdate=21 November 2010 |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129025737/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2010/1120/1224283770522.html |archivedate=29 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the [[National Asset Management Agency]] (NAMA) appointed receivers to some properties controlled by Dunne. One of the properties included in the receivership is Hume House in Ballsbridge, which he bought in 2006 for €130 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0722/nama.html |publisher=RTÉ News |title=Receiver appointed to Sean Dunne properties |date=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2012, Dunne faces the prospect of bankruptcy after he agreed to court orders directing him to repay more than €185 million to the [[National Asset Management Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/bankruptcy-fear-as-dunne-must-repay-nama-185m-3045904.html |work=Irish Independent |first1=Dearbhail |last1=McDonald |title=Bankruptcy fear as Dunne must repay NAMA €185m |date=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Dunne filed for [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter seven bankruptcy]] in the state of [[Connecticut]] in the United States where he has been resident since the failure of his development in Ballsbridge. Dunne lodged the action on Friday, 29 March 2013; he estimated his assets at between EUR 777 786 and EUR 7.77 million EUR, whilst his liabilites exceed EUR 390 million. His creditors could thus receive as little as two percent of what he owes them. Dunne commented, "I can always say to anyone that we did our best and came up short but now we move on".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/commercial-property/developer-se%C3%A1n-dunne-says-he-could-be-debt-free-in-six-months-1.1344860 |work=Irish Times|first1=Simon |last1=Carswell |title=Developer Seán Dunne says he could be debt-free in six months |date=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
In 1990, Dunne was involved with the development of lands at [[St. Helen's, Booterstown|St Helens]] in [[Booterstown]], Dublin through Berland Homes company, of which he was managing director. St Helens was the former headquarters for the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] in Ireland. The main house is now a Radisson hotel. Prices for the homes at the time were priced at between £90,000 for a two-bedroom bungalow and £250,000 for a five bedroom home with conservatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1990/0315/Pg021.html|title=Houses to cost £90,000 to ¼m at St Helens|date=15 March 1990|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=31 December 2011|location=Dublin|first=Willie|last=Clingan}}&lt;/ref&gt; After higher stamp duty rates were introduced in September 1990, Berland was forced to reduce the price of houses by up to 10% in order to increase sales.

In 1994, Dunne along with fellow Berland directors, David Shubotham, James Burke and Frank Belton sought to build 200 apartments in the grounds of St Helens. Rebecca Jeffares of St Helen's House Preservation Group had previously prevented an office development at the site in 1992. Planning permission for the 200 apartment development was ultimately refused by An Bord Pleanala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1994/1229/Pg015.html|title=Bord Pleanala turns down 200-flat St Helen's scheme|date=29 December 1994|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=31 December 2011|location=Dublin|first=Frank|last=McDonald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1995, Dunne had a dispute with the fellow directors of Berland. Claims of oppression were made in a petition by Dunne, then of Torquay Road, Foxrock, and two investment companies, Sainda Limited and Ronaldsay Limited against Berland, Mulroy Securities, Whitebeam Limited, Paul Coulson and David Shubotham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1995/0307/Pg014.html|title=Court told of dispute between shareholders at Berland|date=7 March 1995|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=31 December 2011|location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1995, Dunne put houses for sale for up to £369,000 at his 18-acre site off Ballybride Road, Rathmichael. The development was for 18 homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1995/0928/Pg031.html|title=Showhouse for sale at £369,000|date=28 September 1995|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=31 December 2011|location=Dublin|first=Orna|last=Mulcahy}}&lt;/ref&gt; By March 1996, six of the homes built by Dunne had been sold. Other sites were sold to other builders.

By 1997 Dunne was involved with another 400-unit development in the grounds of St Raphael's hospital in [[Lucan, Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1997/0116/Pg031.html|title=Buyers will have a wider choice|date=16 January 1997|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=31 December 2011|location=Dublin|first=Jack|last=Fagan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1997 Dunne bought Woodtown Manor and 150 acres in [[Rathfarnham]], Dublin from Guinness heir [[Garech Browne]] for around £1.4m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1997/0501/Pg031.html|title=Guinness heir makes £1.4m from land sale|date=1 May 1997|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=31 December 2011|location=Dublin|first=Jack|last=Fagan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same year, Dunne put Grattan House, Grand Canal Street, Dublin up for sale. The asking price was £6.5 million, with the property leased at the time by the Office of Public Works for £547,500 per year. Dunne had bought the property in December 1996 for £5m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1997/1015/Pg024.html|title=£6.5m sough for high-profile office|date=15 October 1997|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=31 December 2011|location=Dublin|first=Jack|last=Fagan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1997, Dunne was involved with the Anna Livia Consortium, which hoped to win the competition to build a national conference centre at Grand Canal Dock. The [[Convention Centre Dublin]] was ultimately developed by Treasury Holdings at Spencer Dock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1997/1127/Pg031.html |work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Dunne through Mountbrook Homes and [[Sean Mulryan]] through Ballymore properties, bought a 100-acre site south of [[Greystones]], County Wicklow. In 2002 they received planning permission for 1,340 homes, pushing the value of the land to an estimated £140m. They also owned a neighbouring 100-acre site which was earmarked for commercial development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/2002/0926/Pg034.html |work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1999 Dunne had expanded into the UK. His building firm, Mountbrook Homes, bought the freehold of a 30,615sq ft office building at [[Walton-on-Thames]], Surrey for £9.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1999/0623/Pg037.html |work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ballsbridge purchase==
Dunne is sometimes referred to as "Lord Ballsbridge" or "Baron of Ballsbridge"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/shane-ross/bertie-and-the-builder-679857.html|title=Bertie and the builder|author=Shane Ross|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=20 May 2007|accessdate=4 January 2009|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of his ambitious development project in [[Ballsbridge]], [[Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/squire-dunnes-precarious-euro510m-704172.html|title=Squire Dunne's precarious €510m|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=17 June 2007|accessdate=4 January 2009|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/commercial-property/dunne-bets-the-house-on-ballsbridge-venture-1252765.html|title=Dunne bets the house on Ballsbridge venture|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=22 December 2007|accessdate=4 January 2009|last=O'Donovan|first=Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunne was accused of recklessness for spending €379m&lt;ref name=NYT_4_Jan_2009&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/business/worldbusiness/04ireland.html?hp|title=The Irish Economy's Rise Was Steep, and the Fall Was Fast |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 January 2009|accessdate=3 January 2009|first=Landon|last=Thomas Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a property deal in the prosperous [[Dublin 4]] section of Dublin in 2005, an amount unprecedented by historical Irish standards at the time of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/d4-deal-not-reckless--dunne-1558891.html|title=D4 deal not reckless -- Dunne |work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=1 December 2008|accessdate=4 January 2009|first=Anne-Marie|last=Walsh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purchase was funded by Icelandic bank [[Kaupthing]] and [[Ulster Bank]]. Kaupthing lent Dunne £84.1m through DCD Builders, according to documents leaked to [[WikiLeaks]] in 2009. Ulster Bank lent the developer €326.5m for the site. Ulster Bank is not involved with the [[National Asset Management Agency]]. Kaupthing valued the sites at €520m according to the documents – Sean Dunne also personally guaranteed €250m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Financial_collapse:_Confidential_exposure_analysis_of_205_companies_each_owing_above_%E2%82%AC45M_to_Icelandic_bank_Kaupthing%2C_26_Sep_2008|title=Analysis of 205 companies |publisher=[[WikiLeaks]]|date=30 July 2009|accessdate=31 December 2011|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, [[An Bord Pleanála]] approved a heavily modified planning application for the Ballsbridge sites. The permission granted included the demolition of the old hotels, operating as D4Hotels, and the construction of 490 apartments. A hotel and healthcare facility were also planned. The 27,000 sq m of retail space proposed in the original €50m and Dunne has said that any works to redevelop the site would not commence until at least 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Political donations==
In 1998 Dunne emerged as the single biggest donor to [[Fianna Fáil]] for 1997. Two cheques, totalling £80,250 were declared to the Public Offices Commission. The donations were made between May and December 1997 by Dunne's DCD Builders, just after Fianna Fáil were elected into power in the [[Irish general election, 1997|1997 General Election]]. £10,000 of the donation had indirectly come from estate agent Fintan Gunne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1998/0606/Pg008.html |work=The Irish Times |date=6 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 two additional donations were made by DCD builders, one for  £5,080 and another for £1,270. In 2000 Dunne declared a £500 donation to [[Fianna Fáil]] after a golf classic.

==Personal life==
{{anchor|Gayle Killilea}}&lt;!-- [[Gayle Killilea]] redirects here --&gt;In 2004, Dunne married ''Sunday Independent'' gossip columnist Gayle Killilea, whom he met at the Galway Races in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/independent-woman/love-sex/meeting-your-true-love-at-the-galway-races-2269958.html|title=Meeting your true love ... at the Galway races|date=23 July 2010|work=The Irish Independent|accessdate=31 December 2011|location=Dublin|first=Anne|last=Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was noted for both its attendees and its expense, believed to be in the region of €1.5 million. The wedding took place on board the [[Christina O]], the yacht once owned by [[Aristotle Onassis]]. Attendees were reported to include [[Karen Millen]], Michael Colgan, [[Michael Fingleton]], Ronan O'Gara, John Mara, Claire Murphy, Paul and Mick Mehigan. During the wedding speeches, then Finance Minister [[Charlie McCreevy]] called the yacht, along with then Taoiseach, [[Bertie Ahern]]. It was reported Ahern said: "Dunner, you and I go back a long way. I wish I could be there.". "I'm sorry I couldn't come but I would have been more trouble to you than I'd be worth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/independent-woman/celebrity-news-gossip/gayleforce-wedding-shows-alisters-how-to-do-it-with-style-482264.html|title=Gayle-force wedding shows A-listers how to do it with style|date=18 July 2004|publisher=The Irish Independent|accessdate=31 December 2011|location=Dublin|first=Anne|last=Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to documents leaked to WikiLeaks from Icelandic Bank Kaupthing, Dunne paid $2.75m with a loan from Kaupthing, for a 1/16th stake in a Gulfstream Jet, as part of the [[Netjets]] fractional ownership scheme. This was done via an Isle of Man company called Zaskari Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;http://opencorporates.com/companies/im/120314C&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16888">'''Spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością'''  (literally: ''Limited liability company''), abbreviated '''Sp. z o.o.''', is the legal title of a [[private limited company]] in [[Poland]].

==Formation of a Sp. z o.o.==

===Overview===
The necessary steps for establishing a Sp. z o.o. (spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością)  are determined by Article 163 KSH ([[Kodeks spółek handlowych]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 163 Nr. 1; Rodzynkiewicz: Kodeks spółek handlowych: Komentarz, S. 271-273; Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  It first requires the notarization of the articles of incorporation. It must take place in [[Poland]]. The conclusion of the [[articles of incorporation]] creates a legal capacity subject, the company prior registration.

The second step requires the full payment of the [[share capital]] as codified by the articles of incorporation. Where required the payment includes the agreed surplus over the nominal value of the company share.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 7; Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 163 Nr. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The share capital may be covered by cash or contribution in kind. Inalienable rights, e.g. work or services cannot place as a deposit in a Sp. z o.o.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 7; Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 14 Nr. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third step is the appointment of the board and possibly other organs of the Sp. z o.o.. The [[Board of Directors]] or the first board members can already be appointed at formation. Once all deposits are paid in full, the board may register for entry into the [[business register]]. The application is inter alia accompanied by a statement of all board members that the deposits were placed to cover the common stock in full by all [[shareholder]]s in the company. The registration of the company in the business register takes about two to four weeks. By registering the company in the business register, the company becomes a [[legal entity]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 9; Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 12 Nr. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  After registration in the business register, the Board of Directors has to request the so-called REGON number at the statistics agency. This is issued within one to two days. Subsequently the Board of Directors has to register the company at the company's financial authorities and obtain the so-called "NIP"-Number (Taxpayer Identification Number) and the VAT number.

The granting of the NIP requires the submission of a lease or other proof that the company has any accommodation, also a bank account contract is required. For these reasons it is recommended that already with formation the Board of Directors is appointed. In this way, in the start-up phase before registration in the business register the company is already able to open a bank account and sign a lease agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bogen/ Siekierzyński (2006): Länderbericht Polen, S. 3 Rn. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content of the articles of incorporation===
The minimum content to be regulated the articles of incorporation determines Article 157 KSH. The articles of incorporation must contain information about the name of the company, place of business, the subject of the activity, the amount of registered capital, an indication of whether a shareholder is allowed to take over one or more company shares, the number and the nominal value of the company shares of each of the shareholders are taken and the duration of the company, if it is determined.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 157 Nr. 1; Rodzynkiewicz: Kodeks spółek handlowych: Komentarz, S. 256-257.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beyond the minimum content the shareholders are free to regulate their relationship to each other or to the company more extensive.

===Costs of formation===
Notable costs are first of all the notary fees, which are calculated in dependence to the share capital. If the share capital amounts e.g. 8000 [[zloty]] (about 2,000 [[EUR]]), the maximum amount to pay is 100 zloty plus 3% on the difference between share capital and 3000 zloty, consequently 3% of 5000 zloty. In result of this the total costs for the notary would be 250 zloty (about 62 EUR). In addition the [[value added tax]] ([[VAT]]) at the legal rate from the current 23% has to be added.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. PAlilZ/ JP Weber (2009): Ratgeber für Investoren – Polen: Hinweise zur Führung der Geschäftstätigkeit, S. 106 und 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, costs incur associated with registering the company in the business register and the publication in for this responsible "monitor Gospodarczy i Sądowy" in the amount of approximately 1500 zloty (about 370 EUR). Finally, within 14 days after formation of the articles of incorporation, the so-called tax on civil law transactions (PCC) is to pay. This is 0.5% of the share capital.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bogen/ Siekierzyński (2006): Länderbericht Polen, S. 6 Rn. 15; Ustawa podatku od czynności cywilnoprawnych, Dz.U. Nr. 86 Pos. 959.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial condition of the Sp. z o.o.==

===Capital raising and capital maintenance===
The share capital amounts to at least 5,000 zloty (about 1,230 EUR). The shares can either be of equal or unequal height, depending on the articles of incorporation. If a shareholder can have more than one share, the shares must be equal and indivisible. The minimum nominal value of a share amounts to 50 zloty (approx. €12.5).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 154 Nr. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish legislator has various instruments to ensure the protection of creditors.

The share capital must be maintained throughout the life of the company. It may be reduced only in the manner allowed by law, e.g. through a capital reduction. The ban also applies to the hidden distribution of profits. A payment from the required share capital covering the company's assets is not possible for the shareholders under any title.&lt;ref&gt;YCf. Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 189 Nr. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The shareholders are also prohibited from referring to or from the assets contributed their rightful share interest. Claims of the shareholder from a granted loan of the Sp. z o.o. applies as a contribution to the company if the loan was granted within two years before the insolvency of the Sp. z o.o.. In addition, Article 14 § 4 KSH contains a setoff of maturing share payments.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Brockhuis/ Schnell (2002): Gesellschaftsrecht in Polen, S. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

The access rights of the shareholders at the company's assets are generally restricted to the distribution of certain portion of the profits.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Change in the share capital amount===
The [[capital increase]] is governed by Articles 255 ff. KSH. Basically, the increase in share capital demanded the change of the articles of incorporation. This requires a notarized resolution of the shareholders' meeting and the entry into the business register. Without changing the articles of incorporation, the capital increase can be carried out only if this is expressly permitted by the articles of incorporation. The exact height to which the share capital can be raised and the exact date to which the increase take place is also a requirement have to be regulated.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The capital increase is carried out either by increasing the nominal value of existing shares or by issuing new shares (ordinary capital increase). In case of the ordinary capital increase the company's assets is increased by the new deposits, which is provided from the old or new shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, the existing shareholders are entitled to acquire the new shares. The take-over declaration needs to be notarized. In the case of the nominal capital increase the share capital will be increased by retained earnings or capital reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[capital reduction]] of share capital requires changing the articles of incorporation in general as well. The shareholders may decide either the recovery of shares or the reduction of the share value. The reduction decision has to determine the amount of the share capital reduction and the way by which the capital should be reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Brockhuis/ Schnell (2002): Gesellschaftsrecht in Polen, S. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimum share capital and the minimum nominal value of shares may not be affected by the reduction. The reduction of the share capital needs to declare immediately to the creditors of the company with the request to object within three months, if they do not agree with the reduction. Creditors, which contradict the deadline, are generally to be satisfied by the company or have to obtain an appropriate security for their claim.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Brockhuis/ Schnell (2002): Gesellschaftsrecht in Polen, S. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each corporate action becomes effective upon its entry into the business register, and thus has a constitutive effect.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Schnell/ Brockhuis (2001): Polen: Gesetzbuch der Handelsgesellschaften - Teil 4: GmbH. WIRO 2001, 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional organ of the Sp. z o.o.==

===The Board of Directors===
The board consists of one or more individuals. To the board may be appointed both shareholders and third parties. Board members may be foreigners or persons resident abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bogen/ Siekierzyński (2006): Länderbericht Polen, S. 26 Rn. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the Board are appointed and dismissed by resolution of the shareholders, unless the articles of incorporation provides otherwise, such as the appointment by the [[Supervisory Board]].

Board members are generally appointed for one year. An excess of this one-year term of office may also be agreed. The term of office generally terminates with the date of holding of the shareholders’ meeting, which approved the financial statements for the last full financial year of the exercise of Executive Function. Board members are also free to withdraw from its role as manager.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 202 Nr. 5; Rodzynkiewicz: Kodeks spółek handlowych: Komentarz, S. 364-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless otherwise agreed in the articles of incorporation, a board member can be dismissed at any time. However, the claims arising from the employment relationship persist.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 203 Nr. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board conducts the business of the Sp. z o.o. and represents it externally. The legal representative of a board member cannot be confined in an external legal effect.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 204 Nr. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The articles of incorporation certainly may determine the way of representation.

The legal base case therefore regulates by a multi-person board that for issuing statements on behalf of the Sp. z o.o. the interaction of two board members or one board member along with a registered manager is required.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kidyba (2010): Kodeks spółek handlowych: TOM I: Komentarz do art. 1-300, § 205 Nr. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other bodies at a glance===
The Supervisory Board performs the constant, the [[Auditing Committee]] the periodic supervision over the [[affairs]] of the Company. The appointment of a Supervisory Board or Audit Commission at a Sp. z oo, in which the capital stock amounts more than 500,000 zloty (approx. 125.000 €) and also more than 25 existing shareholders, is mandatory. Otherwise the shareholders are responsible for an agreement in the articles of incorporation on the appointment of a supervisory board or audit commission. Both organs consist of at least three members who are appointed or dismissed by shareholders' resolution. The duties and responsibilities of those supervisory organs include the [[annual audit]] and the examination of the [[annual report]] of the Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, there is to mention the shareholders meeting. The shareholders' meeting is equipped with extensive skills and at the same time the supreme decision-making body of the Sp. z o.o.. By operation of law, the decisions on important matters are reserved to the shareholders' meeting. The competencies include the examination and approval of the annual report of the Board of Directors, the statement of profit and loss, the approval of the Board of Directors, the Supervisory Board and the Audit Commission, any decision on repayment of additional contributions, the sale or [[lease out]] of a company and the appointment of limited real rights on it.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Brockhuis/ Schnell (2002): Gesellschaftsrecht in Polen, S. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights and obligations of shareholders==
The main duties of the shareholders include the provision of full deposit, the compensation of excessive determined contributions in kind and the reimbursement of unjustified payments (Art. 175, 198 KSH). Under the special relation of the articles of incorporation may accrue the following duties: acquisition of administrative or supervisory duties, the obligation to recurring [[contributions in kind]] (Art. 176 KSH) or to pay [[further margins]] (Article 177 KSH).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the property rights primarily belongs the right to receive [[dividends]] (Art. 192 KSH), the subscription rights (Article 258 KSH), the participation of the net profits (Art. 191 ff KSH) and the settlement proceeds (Article 286 KSH), a claim for contributions in kind (Art. 176 KSH) and the repayment of the deposit for capital reduction and cancellation of the share and the right for repayment of unused further margins (Article 179 KSH).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The administrative rights include especially the participation of [[corporate resolution]]s (Art. 227 ff KSH), the appeal of such resolutions (Article 250 KSH), minority protection, the action for [[Dissolution (law)|dissolution]] of the Company and to the expulsion of shareholders (Article 271 No. 1, 266 § 1 KSH) and the individual right to obtain information and control of each shareholder (Art. 212 KSH, which can only be restricted or excluded if the appointment of a supervisory body is provided, Article 213 § 3 KSH).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deviation from the equality in principle envisaged in terms of rights and duties of all shareholders may be prerogatives recognized under the special relation of the articles of incorporation. In particular, those prerogatives may affect the right to vote (more than three votes per share) and the right to dividend (maximum of 150% of the dividend to be paid to a non-privileged share).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Brockhuis/ Schnell (2002): Gesellschaftsrecht in Polen, S. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liquidation and Insolvency==
The dissolution of a Sp. z o.o and the associated deletion in the business register takes place after carrying out the liquidation. Further steps are governed by Article 274 ff. KSH.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Causes for dissolution may result from the law as well as the articles of incorporation. Notable examples: Resolution of the shareholders to dissolve the company or to transfer the registered office abroad, the announcement of the insolvency of the company as well as a verdict of a court.

The legal basis of the insolvency of a Sp. z o.o. regulates the Polish Bankruptcy and Restructuring Law of 2003. The bankruptcy must be applied if the company is illiquid, means the company is unable pay their liabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Oplustil in Liebscher/ Zoll (2005): Einführung in das polnische Recht, 2. Teil § 15 Rn. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stakeholder  register''' is a document that describes who (individual or group) is affected by a project, and their effect and impact on the project. A stakeholder  register is ideally completed early in the project to ensure proper engagement of stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/careers/project-management/pmp-certification/what-you-should-know-about-stakeholder-registers-for-the-pmp-certification-exam/|title=What You Should Know about Stakeholder Registers for the PMP Certification Exam - dummies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agileearth.com/stakeholder-register/|title=What is the Stakeholder Register?|date=11 May 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources for the register include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4737">The '''Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community''', commonly referred to as '''NACE''' (for the French term ''"'''n'''omenclature statistique des '''a'''ctivités économiques dans la '''C'''ommunauté '''e'''uropéenne"''), is the [[Industry classification|industry standard classification system]] used in the European Union. The current version is revision 2 and was established by Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006.&lt;ref&gt;Regulation (EC) No 1893/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 establishing the statistical classification of economic activities NACE Revision 2 and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90 as well as certain EC Regulations on specific statistical domains. OJ L 393, 30.12.2006, p. 1–39. [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32006R1893 EurLex]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the European implementation of the UN classification [[International Standard Industrial Classification|ISIC]], revision 4.

There's a correspondence between NACE and [[International Standard Industrial Classification|United Nations' International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities]].&lt;ref&gt;http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regso.asp?Ci=70&amp;Lg=1&amp;Co=&amp;T=0&amp;p=2&lt;/ref&gt;

NACE is similar in function to the SIC and NAICS systems:
* [[Standard Industrial Classification]]
* [[North American Industry Classification System]]

[[Image:NACE chooser.png|right|thumb|a screenshot of NACE being used in a computer program]]

NACE uses four hierarchical levels:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=DSP_GEN_DESC_VIEW_NOHDR&amp;StrNom=NACE_REV2&amp;StrLanguageCode=EN EU RAMON classification database]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Level 1: 21 sections identified by alphabetical letters A to U; 
* Level 2: 88 divisions identified by two-digit numerical codes (01 to 99); 
* Level 3: 272 groups identified by three-digit numerical codes (01.1 to 99.0); 
* Level 4: 615 classes identified by four-digit numerical codes (01.11 to 99.00).

The first four digits of the code, which is the first four levels of the classification system, are the same in all European countries. National implementations may introduce additional levels. The fifth digit might vary from country to country and further digits are sometimes placed by suppliers of databases.

== Level 1 Codes ==

{{Taxation}}

The '''Tax Justice Network''' (or '''TJN'''), is an independent [[advocacy group]] consisting of a coalition of international researchers and activists with a shared concern about [[tax avoidance]], [[tax competition]], [[tax evasion]], and [[tax havens]].  It has a particular focus on [[offshore financial centres]] that behave as [[corporate tax haven]]s.
The Tax Justice Network gathers organizations, social movements, and advocates for international tax cooperation, and against tax evasion and tax competition. TJN's goal is to achieve progressive, democratic, and socially just tax systems. It carries out campaigns from an internationalist perspective whose purpose is to develop a fiscal system that is favourable to the poor in developing and developed countries, that finances public good, and that mitigates public wrongs such as pollution and unacceptable inequality.

==Foundation and growth==
TJN grew out thank to the process of the global social forum and the international movement of [[ATTAC]]. TJN is a multilingual, non-partisan, non-governmental, plural and diverse network. It has as members and militants’ organizations of social movements and national, regional and local civil society, as well as activists for justice in taxes, researchers, journalists, development specialists, trade unionists, and professionals of taxation, politicians and officials.

[[Civil Society]] is progressively committing itself to the issues of capital flight, tax evasion and tax fraud and competition, which are generally seen as obstacles to the mobilization of national resources in developing countries. In June 2000, one of the main NGOs dedicated to development published a report titled Tax Havens: “Unlocking the hidden billions to eradicate poverty”. The creation of the Tax Justice Network was in part a consequence of the publication of that report. In the United States, the Citizens for Tax Justice Organization has undertaken a similar effort, although with a national focus. On the contrary, TJN focuses primarily on the international level.

Since 2000, ATTAC, which was born in France in support of the called Tobin tax, has become a movement of international pressure that faces the problems of tax fraud, financial crime and the abuse of tax havens. In April 2005, ATTAC-Spain asked the Government not to recognize the fictitious and instrumental companies registered in tax havens before the Spanish legal system. And ATTAC-Germany played a decisive role in the creation of Tax Justice Network, whose diffusion is spreading in the Spanish-speaking countries.

Until recently, international fiscal policy was hardly a field for civil campaigns, as can be demonstrated by an example. In June 2003, the G8 meeting in Evian summoned 300,000 demonstrators in Geneva, 3,000 people registered to pressure the delegates and Geneva came to a standstill. In December 2003 the UN Committee of Fiscal Experts met in Geneva and TJN was the only civil society organization that attended and intervened in the meeting.

==Functions and objectives.==
The main purpose is to combat the lobbying activities of accounting, business or law organizations that use considerable amounts of time and money to ensure favourable tax treatment for wealthy individuals and powerful organizations that shape their customers. 
Other functions of TJN:

* Conducts campaigns for social change through public debate and education. Public understanding of tax issues is the pre-requirement for international tax justice. The Network makes information available through the media as well as through conferences and seminars, the Internet, news bulletins, printed publications, symbolic actions, demonstrations and promotion and defense of its objectives. We base our activities on solvent research and expert knowledge.

* Facilitates cooperation among its members and sharing information and communication. It organizes international exchange and policy debates to harmonize the opinions and concerns of our members. This process forms the basis for the comprehensive global campaigns on international fiscal policy.

==Management== 
 
It is managed by its member organizations as well as by individual militants. It ensures the visibility of member organizations in their activities and participation in the decision-making of the Network. It operates in accordance with the principles of participatory democracy, its empowerment, transparency, accountability and equal opportunities. TJN encourages and supports, when necessary, member organizations and individuals to participate in decision making. The Network supports the development of national TJN campaigns, particularly in developing countries. The activities of the Network are coordinated by an international secretariat. 
The Network includes:
* national, regional and local civil society (specially important)
* development organizations and several NGOs
* religious groups
* unions
* researchers 
* journalists
* economists
* financial professionals

==Empirical results==

In March 2005, TJN published the results of an investigation that demonstrated $ 11.5 million of the personal wealth of wealthy individuals held in offshore financial centers. In addition, to minimize taxes or to avoid paying them, a large proportion of this wealth is managed in about 70 tax havens. If the income from this wealth patrimony will pay the taxes in the countries where these rich individuals reside or where they obtain their wealth, the additional tax collection available for the financing of public services and for investment in the whole world would be around 255,000 million of annual dollars. We emphasize that this estimate of the loss of tax revenues does not include the tax evasion of transnational corporations or the reduction of tax revenues caused by tax competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Price of Offshore|url=http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Price_of_Offshore.pdf|publisher=Tax Justice Network|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Financial Secrecy Index]] is a biennial publication of the TJN which was started in 2009 and was last released in January 2018.  It covers 112 global jurisdictions and produces a "Secrecy Indicator" score for each on based on 20 qualitative criteria. Releases are widely covered in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report Says U.S. Is World's Second-Biggest Tax Haven|publisher=Bloomberg News| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/u-s-seen-as-world-s-second-biggest-tax-haven-after-switzerland|date=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Becomes World’s Second-Biggest Tax Haven|publisher=Wall Street Journal| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2018/01/30/u-s-becomes-worlds-second-biggest-tax-haven/|date=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN urged to launch global effort to end offshore tax evasion|publisher=The Guardian| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/30/un-urged-to-launch-global-effort-to-end-offshore-tax-evasion|date=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia a safe haven for illicit funds, but Switzerland the world's worst|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/australia-a-safe-haven-for-illicit-funds-but-switzerland-the-worlds-worst-20180131-h0qyxl.html|date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TJN has reported on the OECD [[Base erosion and profit shifting]] (BEPS) projects and conducted their own research that the scale of corporate taxes being avoided by multinationals is an estimated $660bn in 2012 (a quarter of US multinationals’ gross profits), which is equivalent to 0.9% of World GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bna.com/tax-avoidance-costing-n57982085579/| title=Tax Avoidance Costing U.S. $189 Billion: Tax Justice Network| publisher=Bloomberg News | date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.taxjustice.net/scalebeps/ | title=Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS| publisher=Tax Justice Network | date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In July 2012, following a study into wealthy individuals with offshore accounts, the Tax Justice Network published claims regarding deposits worth at least $21 trillion (£13 trillion), potentially even $32 trillion, in secretive tax havens.

'''''The Harder They Fall''''' is a 1956 [[boxing]] [[film noir]] directed by [[Mark Robson]] and based on [[Budd Schulberg]]'s 1947 novel. It marked [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s final film role.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Hal. {{Allmovie title|id=21565|title=The Harder They Fall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography, Black and White]] for [[Burnett Guffey]] at the [[29th Academy Awards]]. [[Joseph Ruttenberg]] for [[Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956 film)|Somebody Up There Likes Me]], however, got the award.

==Plot==
Sportswriter Eddie Willis is broke after the newspaper he works for goes under. He is hired by boxing promoter Nick Benko. He recruits Toro Moreno, an Argentinian boxer. Unbeknownst to Toro and his manager Luís Agrandi, all of his fights had been fixed to make the public believe that he is for real. Toro challenges Gus Dundee, a champion boxer who died of a brain hemorrhage, after losing to Buddy Brannen. Eddie hesitates to promote Toro. Despite the misgivings of his wife, Benko convinced him otherwise, due to Eddie's attempted pay-day. Feeling guilty, Toro wishes to return to Argentina, but Eddie convinces him to work together. In the meantime, Benko plans to use Toro and places the bet against any champion boxers. Eddie teaches Toro on how to hit one of the handlers. While fighting with Brannen, Toro ends up having a broken jaw. When Eddie takes the money owed to him and Toro, he finds out that Benko has rigged the accounting and Toro earns $49.07. Ashamed, Eddie sends Toro home to Argentina with their share of the proceeds, $26,000. Eddie writes the exposure about the corruption.

==Production==
In early 1956, Bogart was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, and he died on January 14, 1957. Steiger said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Bogey and I got on very well. Unlike some other stars, when they had closeups, you might have been relegated to a two-shot, or cut out altogether. Bogey didn't play those games. He was a professional and had tremendous authority. He'd come in exactly at 9am and leave at precisely 6pm. I remember once walking to lunch in between takes and seeing Bogey on the lot. I shouldn't have because his work was finished for the day. I asked him why he was still on the lot, and he said, 'They want to shoot some retakes of my closeups because my eyes are too watery'. A little while later, after the film, somebody came up to me with word of Bogey's death. Then it struck me. His eyes were watery because he was in pain with the cancer. I thought: 'How dumb can you be, Rodney'!"{{sfn|Fantle|Johnson|2009|p=140}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The film was released with two different endings: one where Eddie Willis (inspired by Harold Conrad) demanded that boxing be banned altogether, and the other where he merely insisted that there be a federal investigation into boxing. The video version contains the "harder" ending, while most television prints end with the "softer" message. Occasionally inaudible in a take, some lines are reported to have been dubbed in post-production by [[Paul Frees]].&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Hal. Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film premiered at the [[1956 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3643/year/1956.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Harder They Fall|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' film critic, [[Bosley Crowther]], liked the film, writing, "It's a brutal and disagreeable story, probably a little far-fetched, and without Mr. Schulberg's warmest character—the wistful widow who bestowed her favors on busted pugs. But with all the arcana of the fight game that Mr. Yordan and Mr. Robson have put into it—along with their bruising, brutish fight scenes—it makes for a lively, stinging film."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9900E3DE1E3CE03BBC4852DFB366838D649EDE Crowther, Bosley], ''[[The New York Times]],'' film review, May 10, 1956. Accessed: August 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Schwartz wrote, "The unwell Bogie's last film is not a knockout, but his hard-hitting performance is terrific as a has-been sports journalist out of desperation taking a job as a publicist for a fight fixer in order to get a bank account ... The social conscience film is realistic, but fails to be shocking or for that matter convincing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sover.net/~ozus/hardertheyfall.htm Schwartz, Dennis], ''Ozus' World Movie Reviews,'' film review, December 17, 2004.

'''''The Wheeler Dealers''''' (a.k.a. '''''Separate Beds''''' in the UK) is a 1963 [[romantic comedy]] film from [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer]], produced by [[Martin Ransohoff]], directed by [[Arthur Hiller]],  that stars [[James Garner]] and [[Lee Remick]], and co-stars [[Phil Harris]], [[Chill Wills]], [[Jim Backus]], and [[Patricia Crowley]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; September 25, 1963, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The film's screenplay was written by [[George Goodman]] and [[Ira Wallach (writer)|Ira Wallach]], based on Goodman's 1959 novel of the same name.

Garner was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goldenglobes.com/person/james-garner?page=1 |title=James Garner |publisher=[[Golden Globe Awards]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Molly Thatcher ([[Lee Remick]]) is a stockbroker languishing in a company run by [[Chauvinism#Male chauvinism|male chauvinist]] Bullard Bear ([[Jim Backus]]). When the company does poorly, he will have to fire somebody; As the only female employee, Molly is the obvious choice since if any of the male employees are fired, it would look like the company is in trouble. He assigns her the seemingly impossible task of unloading shares of an obscure company called Universal Widgets; when she fails, he will have an excuse to dismiss her.

Molly meets Henry Tyroon ([[James Garner]]), an aggressive wheeler dealer who dresses, talks, and acts like a stereotypical [[Texas]] millionaire. He's more interested in her than in Universal Widgets, but decides to be of help in order to get closer to her. As they spend time together, Molly watches Henry make complicated business deals, often in partnership with his Texan cronies, Jay Ray ([[Chill Wills]]), Ray Jay ([[Phil Harris]]), and J.R. (Charles Watts). One such deal is a venture into dealing modern art, with the aid of Stanislas ([[Louis Nye]]), a cynical [[avant-garde]] painter.

Molly and Henry have trouble figuring out Universal Widgets' reason for existence; its only factory burned down around the time of the [[Spanish-American War]]. It manufactures nothing and provides no services. (Widgets had something to do with horse-drawn carriages.) It's just a corporation on paper whose sole asset is a huge block of shares in [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]], bought long, long ago when the stock was ridiculously cheap. Now it pays out hefty, regular [[dividend]]s to its two complacent shareholders.

When Henry makes attempts to take control of Universal Widgets by what appears to be questionable methods, over-enthusiastic government regulator Hector Vanson ([[John Astin]]) takes him to Federal court. Further complications arise when Jay Ray, Ray Jay, and J.R. get Molly fired so that she will spend more time in Texas with Henry. She thinks Henry is responsible after discovering that he is really an Easterner and a Yale University graduate; the Texan act just helps him with his wheeling and dealing. The judge dismisses the Federal Securities Commission case when it is determined that all the Universal Widgets' shares are controlled by just six people, including Henry and the Texans, not the general public; the Texans trio's interest is bought out, then and there, for a sizable profit. The trio also confesses that they were the ones who had Molly fired. After hearing this, she quickly makes up with Henry.

==Reception==
''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer [[Bosley Crowther]] was unimpressed, writing "somehow the script of George J. W. Goodman and Ira Wallach doesn't jell and isn't droll, and Arthur Hiller's direction is too slow for romantic comedy. What might be brightly satiric simply isn't because it lacks wit. Too much double entry and too little double entendre".&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |title=The Wheeler Dealers (1963) |author=Bosley Crowther |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 15, 1963 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9503E7DA1730E433A25756C1A9679D946291D6CF}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, like Garner ("spry and briskly charming") and Remick ("cute").&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Reviewer [[Glenn Erickson]] characterized it as an "entertaining trifle that, if I read it right, outsmarts itself. Nobody on either side of the camera seems to know that the joke is really on them, and us, and our way of life".&lt;ref name=Erickson&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s3572whee.html |title=The Wheeler Dealers |publisher=DVD Savant |accessdate=October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought both stars gave "outstanding performances" and rated the film "Good +".&lt;ref name=Erickson/&gt;

==Home media==
''The Wheeler Dealers'' was released on June 27, 2011 by Warner Home Video as a widescreen Region 1 DVD via its Warner Archive DVD-on-demand service.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1085">'''Uthingo Management (Pty) Ltd''' was the operator of the [[South African National Lottery]] until March 2007. It was formed in 1996 to compete for this right amongst a total of three consortia bidding for the licence.  Uthingo is not tasked with the allocation of funds to beneficiary organisations, but is instead mandated to raise revenue for the [[National Lottery Distribution Trust Fund]].

It is a fully [[Black Economic Empowerment]] compliant business, with 70% ownership locally, and the remaining 30% being owned by international players who provided the tools and knowledge to run a lottery effectively.

Uthingo lost the bid to renew its license as the lottery operator to [[Gidani]] after a legal battle and negotiations with the Ministry of Trade and Industry. During that period (March to October 2007) the South African National Lottery was suspended and the first Lotto draw after Gidani took over from Uthingo was on 13 October 2007.

'''Vehicle leasing''' is the [[leasing]] (or the use) of a [[motor vehicle]] for a fixed period of time at an agreed amount of money for the lease. It is commonly offered by dealers as an alternative to vehicle purchase but is widely used by businesses as a method of acquiring (or having the use of) vehicles for business, without the usually needed cash outlay. The key difference in a lease is that after the primary term (usually 2, 3 or 4 years) the vehicle has to either be returned to the leasing company or purchased for the [[Profit (accounting)|residual]] value.

==Rationale==
Vehicle leasing offers advantages to both buyers and sellers. For the buyer, lease payments will usually be lower than payments on a car loan would be.  Any sales tax is due only on each monthly payment, rather than immediately on the entire purchase price as in the case of a loan.  Some consumers may prefer leasing as it allows them to simply return a car and select a new model when the lease expires, allowing a consumer to drive a new vehicle every few years without the responsibility of selling the old vehicle, or possible repair costs after expiry of the manufacturer's warranty. A lessee does not have to worry about the future value of the vehicle, while a vehicle owner does. For a business lessor there are tax advantages to be considered.

For the seller, leasing generates income from a vehicle the seller (or manufacturing corporation) still owns and will be able to lease again or sell through [[vehicle remarketing]] once the original (or primary) lease has expired. As consumers will typically use a leased vehicle for a shorter period of time than one they buy outright, leasing may generate repeat customers more quickly, which may fit into various aspects of a dealer's business model.

==Market penetration==
Leasing's average retail market penetration rate in the United States for new passenger vehicles reached an all-time record high of 26.5% in February 2014.&lt;ref name="JDP"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://autos.jdpower.com/content/press-release/0VoTMNq/j-d-power-reports-auto-buyers-are-committing-to-leasing-and-long-term-loans-at-record-levels.htm| title=J.D. Power Reports: Auto Buyers Are Committing To Leasing And Long-Term Loans At Record Levels| publisher=[[J. D. Power and Associates|J.D. Power]], [[McGraw Hill Financial]]| date= 2014-02-06| accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents a recovery from a severe drop during the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]]. As of 2016, leasing accounted for about 25 percent of total vehicle sales or 31 percent retail sales in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Popely|first1=Rick|title=Glut of off-lease cars makes it good time to buy used|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2017/03/30/buying-used-leases/99797378/|accessdate=24 April 2017|work=The Detroit News|date=30 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalence of leasing in the United States for [[General Motors|GM]], [[Ford]] and [[Chrysler]] have been rising close to the industry norm since reaching low single digits in 2009, but still lower than [[BMW]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]].&lt;ref name="JDPmanu"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.niada.com/uploads/dynamic_areas/wp6QIPSw6C83LYM1dGrU/33/UCMR_2014_Final.pdf| title=2014 Used Car MarketReport| pages=24|publisher=[[Manheim Auctions|Manheim Consulting]]| accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lease agreement==
Lease agreements typically stipulate an early termination fee and limit the number of miles a lessee can drive (for passenger cars, a common number is 10,000 miles per annum though the amount can be stipulated by the customer and can be 12,000 to 15,000 miles per year). If the mileage allowance is exceeded, fees may apply. Dealers will typically allow a lessee to negotiate a higher mileage allowance, for a higher lease payment. Lease agreements usually specify how much wear on the vehicle is allowable, and the lessee may face a fee if that amount of wear has been exceeded.&lt;ref name="fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/leasing/|title=FRB: Leasing Guide|accessdate=2007-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lease with maintenance (commonly known in the UK as Contract Hire) can include all vehicle running costs excluding fuel and insurance.

The actual lease payments are calculated in a very similar way to loan payments, but instead of an [[Annual percentage rate|APR]], the company uses something called the [[money factor]].

At the end of a lease's term, the lessee must either return the vehicle to or buy it from the owner. The end of lease price is usually agreed upon when the lease is signed.&lt;ref name="fr" /&gt;

Typically a leasing company will have a minimum length of lease such as 24 months up-to 60 months. Recently a new view on leasing is that the market has grown for short term lease called 'flexi-lease'. Flexi-lease is when a person can lease a new vehicle for 3 months and then choose to hand the car/van back or indeed extend the lease for another period. This is almost the same as van hire but typically involves the finance or leasing company maintaining and being ultimately responsible for the vehicle.

== UK Vehicle Leasing ==
Similarly to the US automotive market, leasing a vehicle enables you to have access to a vehicle that you might otherwise be unable to afford if you were to finance the full value. Compared to a PCP method of finance, leasing is far more benefical if you plan on changing your vehicle at the end of the initial contract, rather than taking ownership.

=== Market Overview ===
In the UK the leasing market has historically been dominated by businesses and fleet customers. In recent years however the market has shifted and now personal contracts have the biggest market share. This is largely influenced by increasing company car tax for drivers (BIK) and taxable allowances for businesses being affected by vehicle emissions. For company car users who opt out, a personal lease contract allows them to have a fixed monthly payment that's subsidised by their employer, but also allows for a more flexible choice of vehicles than a rigid company car policy.
