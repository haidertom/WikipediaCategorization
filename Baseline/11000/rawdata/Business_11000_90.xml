Cheng often posts his views on socio-political issues in Singapore on Facebook, and is known for attracting controversy at times for his outspoken views&lt;ref name="today-facebook"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tang|first1=Louisa|title=The Big Read: In the Facebook era, whither quality public discourse?|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/big-read-facebook-era-whither-quality-public-discourse|accessdate=16 November 2017|work=Today (newspaper)|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for his personal attacks against people with whom he disagrees.&lt;ref name=Online2016/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chia|first1=Lianne|title=Dealing with online lynch mobs: How companies should react|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/dealing-with-online-lynch-mobs-how-companies-should-react-7929258|accessdate=24 November 2017|work=Channel NewsAsia|date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, while he was on the Media Literacy Council, Cheng wrote provocative comments about killing the children of terrorists on the Facebook page of entrepreneur and commentator [[Devadas Krishnadas]].&lt;ref name=zannia&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zannia|first1=Neyla|title=Police closes case of former NMP Calvin Cheng, calling for kids of terrorists to be killed|url=https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2016/10/11/police-closes-case-of-former-nmp-calvin-cheng-calling-for-kids-of-terrorists-to-be-killed/|work=The Online Citizen|date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=st20151216&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/police-report-filed-against-former-nmp-calvin-cheng-for-controversial-comments-about|title=Police report filed against former NMP Calvin Cheng for controversial comments about terrorists' children|author=Rachel Au-Yong|work=The Straits Times|date=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His comments led to a verbal chiding from [[Tan Cheng Han]], the Chairman of the MLC. In addition, two reports calling for investigation were filed with police, including one by Augustin Lee Tze Shih, organising secretary of the [[People's Power Party (Singapore)|People's Power Party]]. Cheng apologized to the MLC.&lt;ref name=secondreport&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/another-police-report-lodged-against-ex-nmp-calvin-cheng|work=TODAY|date=17 December 2015|title=Second police report filed over ex-NMP Calvin Cheng's ‘killing children’ remarks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MLCchair"&gt;{{cite news|title=Calvin Cheng’s ‘killing children’ remarks ‘insensitive and inappropriate’: MLC chairman|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/calvin-chengs-killing-children-remarks-insensitive-and-inappropriate-mlc-chairman|work=Today Online|date=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Chew Hui Min|title=Calvin Cheng's comments on 'killing children' insensitive, but not hate speech, says Media Literacy Council|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/calvin-chengs-comments-on-killing-children-insensitive-but-not-hate-speech-says-media|accessdate=26 March 2017|work=The Straits Times|date=28 November 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Amos Yee]], a teenager who had been previously jailed for comments offensive to the Singaporean government, was convicted and jailed in 2016 for "hurting religious feelings" in his online responses to Cheng's Facebook posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blogger Amos Yee arrested again|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/blogger-amos-yee-arrested-again-0|work=The Straits Times|date=13 May 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=En|first1=Siau Ming|title=Amos Yee jailed 6 weeks, fined for hurting religious feelings|url=http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/amos-yee-jailed-6-weeks-fined-s2000-over-religious-insults|work=TODAYonline|date=September 29, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, a United States judge granted Yee [[political asylum]], citing the different ways that Cheng and Yee had been treated, where Cheng was not charged, and Yee was charged and convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Philemon|first1=Jewel|title=Amos Yee is deserving of asylum, US Board of Immigration Appeal rules|url=http://www.theindependent.sg/amos-yee-is-deserving-of-asylum-us-board-of-immigration-appeal-rules/|work=The Independent|date=September 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Central location tests''' are a type of Quantitative research technique. They are [[Product (business)|product]] [[marketing]] [[Marketing research|tests]] performed in [[controlled environment]]s, contrary to [[home-user test]]s, which take place where the products would actually be used. 

A Central Location Test (CLT) is one in which the research is conducted in a location such as a room in a shopping mall. In this instance, consumers would be recruited to participate in a research product at the mall and the research would be conducted and completed at that time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9788">A '''central securities depository''' ('''CSD''') is a specialist financial organization holding [[securities]] such as [[Share (finance)|shares]] either in certificated or uncertificated ([[Dematerialization (securities)|dematerialized]]) form so that ownership can be easily transferred through a [[book entry]] rather than the transfer of physical certificates.  This allows [[brokerage firm|brokers]] and financial companies to hold their securities at one location where they can be available for [[clearing (finance)|clearing]] and [[Settlement (finance)|settlement]].  This is usually done electronically, making it much faster and easier than was traditionally the case where physical certificates had to be exchanged after a trade had been completed.

In some cases these organizations also carry out centralized comparison, and transaction processing such as clearing and settlement of securities.

== Scope ==
A CSD can be national or international in nature, and may be for a specific type of security, such as [[government bond]]s.

===Domestic central securities depository===
Many countries have one domestic CSD that was traditionally associated with the national stock exchange.  These organizations are typically heavily regulated by the government and may or may not be separate from the exchanges where trading in securities occurs.

===International central securities depository (ICSD)===
An international CSD is a central securities depository that settles trades in international securities such as [[eurobond]]s although many also settle trades in various domestic securities, usually through direct or indirect (through local agents) links to local CSDs.  Examples of international CSDs include [[Clearstream]] (previously [[Cedel]]), [[Euroclear]] and SIX SIS.  While viewed as a national CSD rather than an ICSD, the US [[Depository Trust Company|Depository Trust Company (DTC)]] does hold over $2 trillion in non-US securities and in [[American depositary receipt]]s from over 100 nations.

==Functions==
* '''Safekeeping''' Securities may be in dematerialized form, book-entry only form (with one or more "global" certificates), or in physical form immobilized within the CSD.  
* '''Deposit and withdrawal''' Supporting deposits and withdrawals involves the relationship between the transfer agent and/or issuers and the CSD.  It also covers the CSD's role within the [[underwriting]] process or listing of new issues in a market.
* '''Dividend, interest, and principal processing, as well as corporate actions including proxy voting''' Paying and transfer agents, as well as issuers are involved in these processes, depending on the level of services provided by the CSD and its relationship with these entities. 
* '''Other services''' CSDs offer additional services aside from those considered core services.  These services include  securities [[lending]] and borrowing, matching, and [[repurchase agreement|repo]] settlement, or ISIN assistance.
* '''Pledge''' - Central depositories provide pledging of share and securities.  Every country is required to provide legal framework to protect the interest of the pledger and pledgee.

However, there are risks and responsibilities regarding these services that must be taken into consideration in analyzing and evaluating each market on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exchange-handbook.co.uk/articles_story.cfm?id=38756&amp;search=1  exchange-handbook.co uk article] on the risks associated with Depositories, at the ''Handbook of world stock, derivative and commodity exchanges'' website.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Certified General Accountant''' ('''CGA''') is a professional designation granted to Canadian [[accountant]]s. A person who meets the education, experience and examination requirements of the [[Certified General Accountants of Canada]] (CGA-Canada) is entitled to use the professional designation and add the letters "CGA" to their title. A CGA is jointly a member of CGA-Canada and a provincial or territorial CGA association, or a CGA association overseas.

CGAs work throughout the world in industry, commerce, finance, government, public practice and the not-for-profit sector. CGA-Canada is working with the [[Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (CPA Canada)]] to integrate operations under the CPA banner in 2014. Those with a CGA designation will be automatically granted the [[Chartered Professional Accountant]] (CPA) designation and are required to use both concurrently until 2024, (noted as CPA, CGA) and then adjust to the CPA designation alone just for it.

==History==

The national association, first known as the Canadian Accountants' Association, was founded in 1908 by a trio of Canadian Pacific Railway accountants in Montreal, Quebec. Five years later, in 1913, the General Accountants' Association, as it was then known, was granted a charter from the government of Canada. By the mid-1940s, association chapters were established from coast-to-coast. Provincial, territorial and regional (offshore) chapters were later established under their own charters.

Auditing rights are regulated by provincial governments.   In [[Prince Edward Island]], only qualified CAs and CGAs can perform public accounting and auditing in accordance with the Public Accounting and Auditing Act.  In all other provinces, except Quebec and Ontario (detailed below), only qualified CAs, CGAs, and CMAs (Certified Management Accountants) may audit public companies.

Historically [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]] only allowed CAs to audit public companies. In 2004, the Ontario government passed legislation that would enable CAs, CGAs and CMAs to practice public accounting under a reconstituted Public Accountants Council, and as of June 2010 Ontario CGAs were allowed to issue audit opinions.

In August 2005, a panel was constituted under the Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT) to rule on a challenge filed by CGA New Brunswick and CGA-Canada. It found Quebec's measures denying CGAs the right to practice public accounting in Quebec to impair trade and recommended legislative changes. The Quebec government committed to address the problem. By November 2009, the 'Regulation respecting the public accountancy permit of the Ordre des comptables généraux accrédités du Québec' enabled qualified CGAs to offer the full range of public accounting services to for-profit and publicly listed companies.

On November 6, 2009, Ontario issued a Notice of Measure claiming that material differences exist in respect of the practice of public accounting in Canada and to protect consumers out of province public accountants would be assessed against Ontario's requirements. Manitoba supported by Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan objected on the grounds that the Ontario regime causes injury to CGAs and impairs internal trade. A Panel convened under the Agreement on Internal Trade reviewed submissions and held a public hearing in Toronto on November 29, 2011. The Panel found that Ontario's notice of measure has impaired or would impair internal trade and has caused or would cause injury. The Panel recommended that Ontario comply with its AIT obligations by April 15, 2012. The outcome is important for CGAs because it removes the last barrier to mobility allowing CGAs to practice public accounting anywhere in Canada.

In October 2013, a Special General Meeting of members was held to ratify an Integration Agreement between CGA-Canada and CPA Canada, which was previously approved by the CGA-Canada Board of Directors. The Integration Agreement has now been approved for adoption, it is now CGA-Canada's intent to sign the Agreement with CPA Canada and continue to work towards unification of the entire profession in Canada.

==Education==

CGA-Canada's professional education program is competency-based. Competency-based education requires candidates to perform tasks and roles to standards expected in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cga.org//en-ca/Programs/Overview/Competency/Pages/_ca_edu_competencies.aspx{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The knowledge, skills and professional values required of a CGA are reflected in a list of competencies. These competencies extend over three areas: professionalism, leadership and professional knowledge. They are validated periodically through extensive survey analysis. The CGA Competency Framework details the 130 competencies required of a newly certified CGA.

The complete academic program consists of 19 courses, two business cases, and professional qualification exams, spread over several levels: Levels 1 to 3 (Foundation Studies), Level 4 (Advanced Studies), and final level, the PACE qualification or certification level.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cga-canada.org&lt;/ref&gt;

A CGA must have an undergraduate degree. Students normally require 36 months of supervised work experience, but in all cases they require a minimum of 24 months. They may meet the experience requirements in any business sector and in a variety of fields.

Before issuing audit opinions a CGA must first be licensed as a public accountant. The requirements for licensing include at least 500 public accounting hours per year.

'''Chancellor House''' is a [[South Africa]]n group of companies active in the [[mining]], [[engineering]], [[energy]] and [[information technology]] sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M&amp;G1|Mail &amp; Guardian(1)]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after [[Chancellor House (building)|Chancellor House]], the building where the law firm of [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Oliver Tambo]] was located.&lt;ref name="Mail &amp; Guardian2"&gt;[[#M&amp;G2|Mail &amp; Guardian(2)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After initially being exposed as a surreptitious funding front for the [[African National Congress]] it was subsequently acknowledged as an in-house investment firm for the party.&lt;ref&gt;[[#M&amp;G3|Mail &amp; Guardian (3)]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is best known for the controversy surrounding the award to it of lucrative [[black economic empowerment]] and [[parastatal]] contracts.

==History==
The existence of the company was first brought to light by the [[Mail &amp; Guardian]] newspaper in a 2006 article. That article alleged that the company had been formed in 2003 on the initiative of [[Mendi Msimang]], then treasurer-general of the ANC, with the explicit intention of raising funds for the party.&lt;ref name="Mail &amp; Guardian2" /&gt;

Prior to the newspaper report the company was virtually unknown; [[Kgalema Motlanthe]], then secretary general of the party, reportedly first learned of it when contacted by the newspaper for comment.&lt;ref&gt;[[#FM1|Financial Mail(1)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eskom contract==
In November 2007 parastatal electricity supplier [[Eskom]] awarded the biggest single contract in its history, for six steam generators worth R20 billion, to a consortium including [[Hitachi Power Africa]]. At the time of the award that company was 25% owned by Chancellor House.&lt;ref&gt;[[#EN1|Engineering News(1)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008 the ANC said it would appoint advisers with a view to transparently exiting the transaction due to governance issues.&lt;ref&gt;[[#BR1|Business Report(1)]]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008 the office of the [[Public Protector]] said an investigation into the transaction was underway.&lt;ref&gt;[[#IOL(1)|Independent Online(1)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chief Ethics Officer''' (CFO) is a senior ranking individual in an organization. The primary role is to build a strong ethical culture within the organization. In order to perform these responsibilities the CFO must be given support, independence, and opportunity to influence key decision-making board members. The chief ethics officer normally reports to the [[chief executive officer]], and have some access to the [[board of directors]].

==The role==
Chief Ethics Officer role was redefined in 1991 for businesses, when [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the Federal Guidelines for Organization (FSCO). Before 1991 this role existed in the financial services and the health care industry without much influence because of the rash of accounting scandals such as the [[Enron scandal]]. The need for chief ethics officers has increased tremendously.  The role of chief ethics officers has increased since the passage of the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] (SOA), and amendments of the [[U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines]] (FSCO).  The role of Chief Ethics Officer is no longer a figure head position.

In 2002, after congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act and the Consumer Protection Act, chief ethics officer responsibilities have expanded.  the role has expanded to be more specific.  The chief ethics officer is responsible for Developing and distributing codes of ethics, developing training programs for employees', monitor and comply too government regulations.  His role is also to monitor and audit ethical conduct.  In addition his responsibilities entails administering punishments for violation of ethical codes of conduct.&lt;ref name="Ferrell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferrell|first1=O.C.|last2=Fraedrich|first2=John|last3=Ferrell|first3=Linda|title=Business Ethics, Ethical Decision Making and cases|date=2017|publisher=Cengage|ISBN=978-1-111-82516-4|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/conf_processings/2012rand_cf305.PDF Rand Corporation]{{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Price ethics ==
The primary objective of pricing ethics is to prevent the establishment of [[monopolies]], inequitable pricing practices, and reduce or restrict competition. Such laws are some times called pro-competitive legislation, which were enacted to encourage competition, and prevent activities that restrain trade.

The following are some of the acts passed by Congress, to help prevent unethical practices by businesses to manipulate prices in order to monopolize their industries, such as the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] of 1890, which prohibits organizations from holding monopolies in their industry, the [[Robinson–Patman Act]] of 1936, which bans price discrimination between retailers and wholesalers, and the Consumer Goods Pricing Acts of 1975, which prohibits price maintenance agreements among manufactures and resellers in interstate commerce.&lt;ref name="Ferrell" /&gt;

== Organizational ethics ==
[[Organizational ethics]] is the ethics of an organization, and it is how an organization responds to an internal or external issue.  Organizational ethics is independent of the [[organizational culture]]. Organizational culture tends to display the same ethical views of the surrounding community.  To reinforce positive views of the community, certain businesses give incentives to both employees and the community.  Business organizations give to community by granting scholarships, funds and resources.  Employees also give back to the community by contributing their time, gifts and talents.  When the local residents obtain the skills from skilled employees then these individuals can apply and fulfill critical skills shortages needed by the organization.  When the incentive value method represent the community in a positive way everyone wins, such as the business organization, and the community.&lt;ref name="Ferrell" /&gt;

== Ethics in business communication ==
Ethical communication is a must for a businesses to have a long and successful future.  A business cannot act unethically when dealing with its customers, employees or other businesses. Unethical communication consist of false or misleading information, which is a violation of the Federal Trade Communication. Other unethical means of marketing material, is by fraud, scams, and e-mail, or text messaging unsolicited marketing material ([[Spamming|SPAM]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2420">'''Constantin Belimace''' (July 1848&amp;ndash;1932) was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-born [[Romania]]n and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] poet.

He was born into an [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] family in [[Malovišta]], a village that formed part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Rumelia Eyalet]] and is now in the Republic of Macedonia. His father was Tașcu Belimace. He attended school in his native village and at a Serbian school in Belgrade. In 1873, he moved to [[Bucharest]], capital of the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]]. There, he opened a restaurant favored by students, particularly from south of the Danube, and by writers. In the enthusiastically patriotic atmosphere that followed the [[Romanian War of Independence]], Belimace began composing poems, thus becoming among the first writers in the [[Aromanian language]]: "Cucotul" ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]: "Cocoșul"; "The Rooster") and "Dimândarea părintească" ("Porunca părintească"; "The Parents' Command"). These appeared, respectively, in ''România'' and ''Voința națională''. Later, together with others, they were published in Andrei Bagav's 1887 ''Cartea de alegere'' (''Cartea de citire''; ''Reader'').&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;

Belimace helped found the Macedo-Romanian cultural society and Lumina association, and took part in editing periodicals such as ''Frațil’ea într’u dreptate'' and ''Macedonia''. His contributions appeared in ''Frațil’ea'', ''Grai bun'', ''Lumina'', ''Peninsula Balcanică'' and ''Românul de la Pind'', as well as in various calendars and almanacs. After returning to Macedonia, he worked as a supervisor at the Romanian boarding high school in [[Bitola]]. During World War I, he was held hostage in Bulgaria for two years. He died in Bitola in 1932, when the city was in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="sasu"&gt;Aurel Sasu (ed.), ''Dicționarul biografic al literaturii române'', vol. I, p. 152.

'''Dallas Reginald Dempster''' (born 27 August 1941) is an Australian businessman notable for original development of Perth's Burswood Resort and Casino (now [[Crown Perth]]) and the proposed [[Kwinana Petrochemical Plant]], both of which were among the Western Australian government transactions examined by the 1990–92 [[WA Inc|WA Inc Royal Commission]]. In November 2013 The ''[[The West Australian|West Australian]]'' newspaper named Dempster as one of Western Australia's 100 most influential business leaders (1829–2013).&lt;ref name="Most Influential"&gt;{{cite news | title=100 Most Influential – The business leaders who shaped WA 1829 – 2013 | work=The West Australian | date=29 November 2013 |author1=Harvey, Ben  |author2=Hatch, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education and early career==
He was born in [[Nedlands, Western Australia]] in 1941 to Dallas Athol Dick and Eileen Olga Dempster. He was educated at [[Hale School]].&lt;ref name=WAY79&gt;Sacks M. A. (ed) (1980) ''The WAY 79 Who is Who: synoptic biographies of Western Australians''  Crawley Publishers, Nedlands, W.A. {{ISBN|0-949848-00-X}}, p.94&lt;/ref&gt;

===Property development===
In collaboration with WA ecologist and wetlands expert Tom Riggert, Dempster developed Floreat Waters Estate at [[Herdsman Lake]], creating permanent lakes by dropping swamp levels below surrounding land, for which he received the Duke of Edinburgh Environment Award.&lt;ref name=ST101289&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Sunday Times|title=Million-dollar gambler|page=7|date=10 December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major projects==

===Burswood casino===
Dempster was a principal in the establishment and early development of Western Australia's only casino, Burswood Resort and Casino (now named [[Crown Perth]]), in partnership with [[Genting Group|Genting Berhad]] of Malaysia which had previous experience in casino development and associated tourism.&lt;ref&gt;Parliament of New South Wales [http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/publications.nsf/0/09A6CB6295F90825CA256ECF00096E34/$File/16-99.pdf Gaming Commissions, Internet Gambling and Responsible Gambling], Retrieved on 6 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original resort complex included a [[Hotel rating|five-star hotel]], casino, recreation facilities with 18-hole golf course, tennis courts, and swimming pools on a site fronting Perth's Swan River, 3&amp;nbsp;km from the city centre. The casino, the third largest in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = Staff writer |title = Australia's Gateway to the Orient – Perth |work = [[Australian Financial Review]] |publisher = John Fairfax Holdings Ltd |page = 5 |date= 23 March 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; opened for business in December 1985, with other facilities progressively launched over the following two years. The adjacent Burswood Park was planned to enhance the approach to Perth from the airport.&lt;ref&gt;Burswood Park Board [http://www.burswoodpark.wa.gov.au/web/About+Us Burswood Park on the Stunning Swan River], Retrieved on 6 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Burswood Casino and Resort committed to providing the revenue to maintain and improve the park indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;Burswood Park Board [http://www.burswoodpark.wa.gov.au/files/reports/BPB_AR_2011_.pdf Burswood Park Board Annual Report 2011], Retrieved on 6 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rival bidders accused Dempster of improper dealings with state premier [[Brian Burke (Australian politician)|Brian Burke]] prior to the awarding of the licence,&lt;ref name="BigRoll"&gt;{{cite news |first = Anthony |last = Dennis |title = After a troubled start, WA's $300M casino is on a big roll |work = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher = John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd |page = 11 |date= 9 May 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but after a thorough investigation of these accusations, the WA Inc Royal Commission stated that there was no evidence of impropriety.  However it noted that following the awarding of the licence, Mr Dempster, a [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] member, had begun making large donations to the ruling [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] cause.&lt;ref name=RoycomV2&gt;State Law Publisher of Western Australia [http://www.slp.wa.gov.au/publications/publications.nsf/DocByAgency/276D079050C3CC4448256984002033D2/$file/volume2.pdf Findings of WA Inc Royal Commission], Vol. 2, Ch. 8. Retrieved on 2 February 2013. Quotation: It is understandable that others should feel aggrieved by the seemingly irresistible advance of the Dempster machine after the closing date and wonder how this "inside running" could have been achieved without some impropriety somewhere. But the fact remains that despite as thorough an investigation as has been open to the Commission, no impropriety in that regard has been established."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petrochemical Industry Company===
{{main|Kwinana Petrochemical Plant}}
In September 1986 Petrochemical Industries Company Limited (PICL), a joint venture involving companies controlled by Dempster and [[Laurie Connell]],&lt;ref name=RoycomV4&gt;State Law Publisher of Western Australia [http://www.slp.wa.gov.au/publications/publications.nsf/DocByAgency/63BAC21E6BA5A5364825698400207E92/$file/volume4.pdf Findings of WA Inc Royal Commission] Vol. 4, Ch.18. Retrieved on 9 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p 9}} proposed the development of a major [[petrochemical]] project at [[Kwinana, Western Australia|Kwinana]], south of [[Fremantle]], and on 2 November 1987 heads of agreement were signed by the government-owned [[State Energy Commission of Western Australia]] and PICL for the former to supply the latter with natural gas from the state's [[North West Shelf]] at a commercially realistic price linked to the [[Consumer price index|CPI]]. By December 1987, though, it was becoming apparent that Connell's merchant bank Rothwells was no longer a viable financial institution, and Dempster had been unable to secure 100% debt finance for the project.&lt;ref name=RoycomPt2&gt;State Law Publisher of Western Australia [http://www.slp.wa.gov.au/publications/publications.nsf/DocByAgency/EB7A73F79B8C4FCA482569850012E10E/$file/report2.pdf Findings of WA Inc Royal Commission] Part II&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p 22}}&lt;ref name=RoycomV5&gt;State Law Publisher of Western Australia [http://www.slp.wa.gov.au/publications/publications.nsf/DocByAgency/37324B79C41BD728482569840020A568/$file/volume5.pdf Findings of WA Inc Royal Commission] Vol. 5, Ch. 21&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p 166}}

Due to outstanding loans to Connell and Connell-associated entities, Rothwells was short $300 million or more needed to restore its solvency and produce an acceptable balance sheet, and without these funds Rothwells would have to cease trading on its reporting date, 31 July 1988. To deal with Rothwells's impending crisis, a mid-1988 meeting involving representatives of the state government, Rothwells and Bond Corporation agreed that the government would give a discounted energy price and other guarantees to PICL so as to boost the company's value to $400 million, and Bond Corporation and the government would then purchase PICL for that price – $350 million to be paid to Connell so that he could repay $300 million of his debt to Rothwells and add $50 million of liquidity, and $50 million to Dempster for his share.&lt;ref name=RoycomV5/&gt;{{rp|pp 168–70}}

Some evidence to the [[WA Inc]] Royal Commission from government officers conflicted with Dempster's evidence, and he was found to have made a series of deliberate false statements regarding the project's viability.&lt;ref name=RoycomV5/&gt;{{rp|p 167}}

'''''Ex aequo et bono''''' ([[Latin]] for "according to the right and good" or "from equity and conscience") is a [[List of legal Latin terms|Latin phrase]] that is used as a legal [[technical terminology|term of art]]. In the context of [[arbitration]], it refers to the power of arbitrators to dispense with consideration of the law but consider solely what they consider to be fair and equitable in the case at hand.

Article 38(2) of the [[Statute of the International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) provides that the court may decide cases ''ex aequo et bono'' only if the parties agree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/documents/index.php?p1=4&amp;p2=2&amp;p3=0 |title=Statute of the Court |publisher=International Court of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, the ICJ decided a case using "equitable criteria" in creating a boundary in the Gulf of Maine for Canada and the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/67/067-19841012-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf |title=Case concerning delimitation of the maritime boundary in the Gulf of Maine Area |publisher=International Court of Justice |date=October 12, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 33 of the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]]'s Arbitration Rules (1976)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/arbitration/arb-rules/arb-rules.pdf |title=UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules |publisher=United Nations Commission on International Trade Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides that the arbitrators shall consider only the applicable law unless the arbitral agreement allows the arbitrators to consider ''ex aequo et bono'', or [[amiable compositeur]], instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jus.uio.no/lm/un.arbitration.rules.1976/33.html |title=Article 33 – Applicable law, amiable compositeur |work=UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (1976) United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rule is also expressed in many national and subnational arbitration laws such as section 22 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 (NSW).

On the other hand, the constituent treaty of the Eritrea–Ethiopia Claims Commission explicitly forbids the body from interpreting ''ex aequo et bono''.

==Ex aequo==
The phrase '''''ex aequo''''' (without ''et bono'') is used to mean "equally placed", often in the context of competition winners.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Chambers Dictionary]]'' (1998). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pz2ORay2HWoC&amp;pg=PA561 "ex aequo"], p. 561. {{ISBN|8186062254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38190">[[Data mining]], the process of discovering patterns in large [[data set]]s, has been used in many applications.

==Games==
Since the early 1960s, with the availability of [[Oracle machine|oracles]] for certain [[combinatorial game]]s, also called [[tablebase]]s (e.g. for 3x3-chess) with any beginning configuration, small-board [[dots-and-boxes]], small-board-hex, and certain endgames in chess, dots-and-boxes, and hex; a new area for data mining has been opened. This is the extraction of human-usable strategies from these oracles. Current pattern recognition approaches do not seem to fully acquire the high level of abstraction required to be applied successfully. Instead, extensive experimentation with the tablebases – combined with an intensive study of tablebase-answers to well designed problems, and with knowledge of prior art (i.e., pre-tablebase knowledge) – is used to yield insightful patterns. [[Berlekamp]] (in dots-and-boxes, etc.) and [[John Nunn]] (in [[chess]] [[Chess endgame|endgames]]) are notable examples of researchers doing this work, though they were not – and are not – involved in tablebase generation.

==Business==

In business, data mining is the analysis of historical business activities, stored as static data in data warehouse databases. The goal is to reveal hidden patterns and trends. Data mining software uses advanced [[Pattern recognition|pattern recognition algorithms]] to sift through large amounts of data to assist in discovering previously unknown strategic business information. Examples of what businesses use data mining for is to include performing market analysis to identify new product bundles, finding the root cause of manufacturing problems, to prevent [[customer attrition]] and acquire new customers, [[cross-selling]] to existing customers, and profiling customers with more accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J. A., &amp; Marakas, G. M. (2011). Management Information Systems. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill/Irwin.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In today’s world raw data is being collected by companies at an exploding rate. For example, Walmart processes over 20 million point-of-sale transactions every day. This information is stored in a centralized database, but would be useless without some type of data mining software to analyze it. If Walmart analyzed their point-of-sale data with data mining techniques they would be able to determine sales trends, develop marketing campaigns, and more accurately predict customer loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, D. (n.d.). Data Mining. Retrieved from The University of Texas at Austin: College of Liberal Arts: http://www.laits.utexas.edu/~anorman/BUS.FOR/course.mat/Alex/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniele Medri: Big Data &amp; Business: An on-going revolution|url=http://www.statisticsviews.com/details/feature/5393251/Big-Data--Business-An-on-going-revolution.html|publisher=[[Statistics Views]]|date=21 Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such example for Walmart would be that of diapers and beer sales, discovered through data mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/08/15/beer_diapers/|title=The parable of the beer and diapers|access-date=2018-02-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Categorization of the items available in the e-commerce site is a fundamental problem. A correct item categorization system is essential for user experience as it helps determine the items relevant to him for search and browsing.  Item categorization can be formulated as a supervised classification problem in data mining where the categories are the target classes and the features are the words composing some textual description of the items. One of the approaches is to find groups initially which are similar and place them together in a latent group.  Now given a new item, first classify into a latent group which is called coarse level classification. Then, do a second round of classification to find the category to which the item belongs to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://labs.ebay.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Jean-David-Ruvini-Large-scale_Item.pdf|title =Large Scale Item Categorization|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20151005215055/http://labs.ebay.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Jean-David-Ruvini-Large-scale_Item.pdf|archivedate =2015-10-05|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Every time a credit card or a store loyalty card is being used, or a warranty card is being filled, data is being collected about the user's behavior. Many people find the amount of information stored about us from companies, such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon, disturbing and are concerned about privacy. Although there is the potential for our personal data to be used in harmful, or unwanted, ways it is also being used to make our lives better. For example, Ford and Audi hope to one day collect information about customer driving patterns so they can recommend safer routes and warn drivers about dangerous road conditions.&lt;ref name="macon.com"&gt;Goss, S. (2013, April 10). Data-mining and our personal privacy. Retrieved from The Telegraph: {{cite web |url=http://www.macon.com/2013/04/10/2429775/data-mining-and-our-personal-privacy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705055127/http://www.macon.com/2013/04/10/2429775/data-mining-and-our-personal-privacy.html |archivedate=2014-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Data mining in [[customer relationship management]] applications can contribute significantly to the bottom line.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Rather than randomly contacting a prospect or customer through a call center or sending mail, a company can concentrate its efforts on prospects that are predicted to have a high likelihood of responding to an offer. More sophisticated methods may be used to optimize resources across campaigns so that one may predict to which channel and to which offer an individual is most likely to respond (across all potential offers). Additionally, sophisticated applications could be used to automate mailing. Once the results from data mining (potential prospect/customer and channel/offer) are determined, this "sophisticated application" can either automatically send an e-mail or a regular mail. Finally, in cases where many people will take an action without an offer, "[[uplift modelling|uplift modeling]]" can be used to determine which people have the greatest increase in response if given an offer. Uplift modeling thereby enables marketers to focus mailings and offers on persuadable people, and not to send offers to people who will buy the product without an offer. [[Data clustering]] can also be used to automatically discover the segments or groups within a customer data set.
* Businesses employing data mining may see a return on investment, but also they recognize that the number of predictive models can quickly become very large. For example, rather than using one model to predict how many customers will [[Churn rate|churn]], a business may choose to build a separate model for each region and customer type. In situations where a large number of models need to be maintained, some businesses turn to more automated data mining methodologies.
* Data mining can be helpful to human resources (HR) departments in identifying the characteristics of their most successful employees. Information obtained – such as universities attended by highly successful employees – can help HR focus recruiting efforts accordingly. Additionally, Strategic Enterprise Management applications help a company translate corporate-level goals, such as profit and margin share targets, into operational decisions, such as production plans and workforce levels.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Monk |first1=Ellen |last2=Wagner |first2=Bret |title=Concepts in Enterprise Resource Planning, Second Edition |publisher=Thomson Course Technology |location=Boston, MA |year=2006 |isbn=0-619-21663-8 |oclc=224465825 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Market basket analysis]], relates to data-mining use in retail sales. If a clothing store records the purchases of customers, a data mining system could identify those customers who favor silk shirts over cotton ones. Although some explanations of relationships may be difficult, taking advantage of it is easier. The example deals with [[association rule]]s within transaction-based data. Not all data are transaction based and logical, or inexact [[Rule of inference|rules]] may also be present within a [[database]].
* Market basket analysis has been used to identify the purchase patterns of the [[Alpha consumer|Alpha Consumer]]. Analyzing the data collected on this type of user has allowed companies to predict future buying trends and forecast supply demands.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
* Data mining is a highly effective tool in the catalog marketing industry.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Catalogers have a rich database of history of their customer transactions for millions of customers dating back a number of years. Data mining tools can identify patterns among customers and help identify the most likely customers to respond to upcoming mailing campaigns.
* Data mining for business applications can be integrated into a complex modeling and decision making process.&lt;ref name=decisionmaking&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elovici | first1 = Yuval | last2 = Braha | first2 = Dan | year = 2003 | title = A Decision-Theoretic Approach to Data Mining | url = http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/IEEE_Decision_Theoretic.pdf | format = PDF | journal = IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics—Part A: Systems and Humans | volume = 33 | issue = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LIONsolver]] uses Reactive business intelligence (RBI) to advocate a "holistic" approach that integrates data mining, [[Modeling and simulation|modeling]], and [[interactive visualization]] into an end-to-end discovery and continuous innovation process powered by human and automated learning.&lt;ref&gt;Battiti, Roberto; and Brunato, Mauro; ''[http://www.reactivebusinessintelligence.com/ Reactive Business Intelligence. From Data to Models to Insight]'', Reactive Search Srl, Italy, February 2011. {{ISBN|978-88-905795-0-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the area of [[decision making]], the RBI approach has been used to mine knowledge that is progressively acquired from the decision maker, and then self-tune the decision method accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Battiti| first1=Roberto| first2=Andrea| last2=Passerini| year=2010| title=Brain-Computer Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization (BC-EMO): a genetic algorithm adapting to the decision maker| journal=IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation| volume=14| issue=15| pages=671–687| doi=10.1109/TEVC.2010.2058118| url=http://rtm.science.unitn.it/~battiti/archive/bcemo.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between the quality of a data mining system and the amount of investment that the decision maker is willing to make was formalized by providing an economic perspective on the value of “extracted knowledge” in terms of its payoff to the organization&lt;ref name="decisionmaking"/&gt; This decision-theoretic classification framework&lt;ref name="decisionmaking"/&gt; was applied to a real-world semiconductor wafer manufacturing line, where [[decision rules]] for effectively monitoring and controlling the semiconductor wafer fabrication line were developed.&lt;ref name=decisionmaking1&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Braha | first1 = Dan | last2 = Elovici | first2 = Yuval | last3 = Last | first3 = Mark | year = 2007 | title = Theory of actionable data mining with application to semiconductor manufacturing control | url = http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/TPRS_A_165421_O.pdf | format = PDF | journal = International Journal of Production Research | volume = 45 | issue = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An example of data mining related to an integrated-circuit (IC) production line is described in the paper "Mining IC Test Data to Optimize VLSI Testing."&lt;ref&gt;Fountain, Tony; Dietterich, Thomas; and Sudyka, Bill (2000); [http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tgd/publications/kdd2000-dlft.pdf ''Mining IC Test Data to Optimize VLSI Testing''], in Proceedings of the Sixth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery &amp; Data Mining, ACM Press, pp. 18–25&lt;/ref&gt; In this paper, the application of data mining and decision analysis to the problem of die-level functional testing is described. Experiments mentioned demonstrate the ability to apply a system of mining historical die-test data to create a probabilistic model of patterns of die failure. These patterns are then utilized to decide, in real time, which die to test next and when to stop testing. This system has been shown, based on experiments with historical test data, to have the potential to improve profits on mature IC products.

Another implication is that on-line monitoring of the semiconductor manufacturing process using data mining may be highly effective.

==Science and engineering==
In recent years, data mining has been used widely in the areas of science and engineering, such as [[bioinformatics]], [[genetics]], [[medicine]], [[educational data mining|education]] and [[electrical power]] engineering.
* In the study of human genetics, [[sequence mining]] helps address the important goal of understanding the mapping relationship between the inter-individual variations in human [[DNA]] sequence and the variability in disease susceptibility. In simple terms, it aims to find out how the changes in an individual's DNA sequence affects the risks of developing common diseases such as [[cancer]], which is of great importance to improving methods of diagnosing, preventing, and treating these diseases. One data mining method that is used to perform this task is known as [[multifactor dimensionality reduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Xingquan |last1=Zhu |first2=Ian |last2=Davidson |title=Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining: Challenges and Realities |publisher=Hershey |location=New York, NY |year=2007 |page=18 |isbn=978-1-59904-252-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the area of electrical power engineering, data mining methods have been widely used for [[condition monitoring]] of high voltage electrical equipment. The purpose of condition monitoring is to obtain valuable information on, for example, the status of the [[insulator (electricity)|insulation]] (or other important safety-related parameters). [[Data clustering]] techniques – such as the [[self-organizing map]] (SOM), have been applied to vibration monitoring and analysis of transformer on-load tap-changers (OLTCS). Using vibration monitoring, it can be observed that each tap change operation generates a signal that contains information about the condition of the tap changer contacts and the drive mechanisms. Obviously, different tap positions will generate different signals. However, there was considerable variability amongst normal condition signals for exactly the same tap position. SOM has been applied to detect abnormal conditions and to hypothesize about the nature of the abnormalities.&lt;ref name="McGrail"&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Anthony J. |last1=McGrail |first2=Edward |last2=Gulski |first3=David |last3=Allan |first4=David |last4=Birtwhistle |first5=Trevor R. |last5=Blackburn |first6=Edwin R. S. |last6=Groot |title=Data Mining Techniques to Assess the Condition of High Voltage Electrical Plant |journal=CIGRÉ WG 15.11 of Study Committee 15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Data mining methods have been applied to [[dissolved gas analysis]] (DGA) in [[power transformer]]s. DGA, as a diagnostics for power transformers, has been available for many years. Methods such as SOM has been applied to analyze generated data and to determine trends which are not obvious to the standard DGA ratio methods (such as Duval Triangle).&lt;ref name="McGrail" /&gt;
* In educational research, where data mining has been used to study the factors leading students to choose to engage in behaviors which reduce their learning,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Ryan S. J. d.&lt;!-- sic --&gt; |last=Baker |title=Is Gaming the System State-or-Trait? Educational Data Mining Through the Multi-Contextual Application of a Validated Behavioral Model |journal=Workshop on Data Mining for User Modeling 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to understand factors influencing university student retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Superby Aguirre, Juan Francisco |author2=Vandamme, Jean-Philippe |author3=Meskens, Nadine |title=Determination of factors influencing the achievement of the first-year university students using data mining methods |journal=Workshop on Educational Data Mining 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar example of social application of data mining is its use in [[Expertise finding|expertise finding systems]], whereby descriptors of human expertise are extracted, normalized, and classified so as to facilitate the finding of experts, particularly in scientific and technical fields. In this way, data mining can facilitate [[institutional memory]].

* In adverse drug reaction surveillance, the [[Uppsala Monitoring Centre]] has, since 1998, used data mining methods to routinely screen for reporting patterns indicative of emerging drug safety issues in the WHO global database of 4.6&amp;nbsp;million suspected [[adverse drug reaction]] incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bate | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Lindquist | first2 = Marie | last3 = Edwards | first3 = I.

* Data mining has been applied to [[software]] artifacts within the realm of [[software engineering]]: [[Mining Software Repositories]].

==Human rights==
Data mining of government records – particularly records of the justice system (i.e., courts, prisons) – enables the discovery of systemic [[human rights]] violations in connection to generation and publication of invalid or fraudulent legal records by various government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Zernik, Joseph; [https://www.scribd.com/doc/38328591/ Data Mining as a Civic Duty – Online Public Prisoners' Registration Systems], ''International Journal on Social Media: Monitoring, Measurement, Mining'', 1: 84–96 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zernik, Joseph; [https://www.scribd.com/doc/38328585/ Data Mining of Online Judicial Records of the Networked US Federal Courts], ''International Journal on Social Media: Monitoring, Measurement, Mining'', 1:69–83 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical data mining==
{{See also|PatientsLikeMe|Comparative genomics}}
Some [[machine learning]] algorithms can be applied in medical field as second-opinion [[Clinical decision support system|diagnostic tools]] and as tools for the knowledge extraction phase in the process of [[knowledge discovery in databases]].
One of these classifiers (called ''Prototype exemplar learning classifier'' ([[PEL-C]])&lt;ref name=Gagliardi2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gagliardi|first=F|title=Instance-based classifiers applied to medical databases: Diagnosis and knowledge extraction|journal=Artificial Intelligence in Medicine|year=2011|volume=52|issue=3|pages=123–139|doi=10.1016/j.artmed.2011.04.002|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2011.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; is able to discover [[syndrome]]s as well as atypical clinical cases.

In 2011, the case of [[Sorrell v. IMS Health, Inc.]], decided by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], ruled that [[Pharmacy|pharmacies]] may share information with outside companies. This practice was authorized under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|1st Amendment of the Constitution]], protecting the "freedom of speech."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= David G. Savage | work = Los Angeles Times |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/24/nation/la-na-court-drugs-20110624 |title=Pharmaceutical industry: Supreme Court sides with pharmaceutical industry in two decisions|date=2011-06-24 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the passage of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act) helped to initiate the adoption of the electronic health record (EHR) and supporting technology in the United States.&lt;ref name="Analyzing Medical Data 2012"&gt;Analyzing Medical Data. (2012). ''Communications of the ACM'' 55(6), 13-15. {{DOI|10.1145/2184319.2184324}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HITECH Act was signed into law on February 17, 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and helped to open the door to medical data mining.&lt;ref&gt;http://searchhealthit.techtarget.com/definition/HITECH-Act&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the signing of this law, estimates of only 20% of United States-based physicians were utilizing electronic patient records.&lt;ref name="Analyzing Medical Data 2012"/&gt; Søren Brunak notes that “the patient record becomes as information-rich as possible” and thereby “maximizes the data mining opportunities.”&lt;ref name="Analyzing Medical Data 2012"/&gt; Hence, electronic patient records further expands the possibilities regarding medical data mining thereby opening the door to a vast source of medical data analysis.

==Spatial data mining==
Spatial data mining is the application of data mining methods to spatial data. The end objective of spatial data mining is to find patterns in data with respect to geography. So far, data mining and [[Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS) have existed as two separate technologies, each with its own methods, traditions, and approaches to visualization and data analysis. Particularly, most contemporary GIS have only very basic spatial analysis functionality. The immense explosion in geographically referenced data occasioned by developments in IT, digital mapping, remote sensing, and the global diffusion of GIS emphasizes the importance of developing data-driven inductive approaches to geographical analysis and modeling.

Data mining offers great potential benefits for GIS-based applied decision-making. Recently, the task of integrating these two technologies has become of critical importance, especially as various public and private sector organizations possessing huge databases with thematic and geographically referenced data begin to realize the huge potential of the information contained therein. Among those organizations are:
* offices requiring analysis or dissemination of geo-referenced statistical data
* public health services searching for explanations of disease clustering
* environmental agencies assessing the impact of changing land-use patterns on climate change
* geo-marketing companies doing customer segmentation based on spatial location.

Challenges in Spatial mining:
Geospatial data repositories tend to be very large. Moreover, existing GIS datasets are often splintered into feature and attribute components that are conventionally archived in hybrid data management systems. Algorithmic requirements differ substantially for relational (attribute) data management and for topological (feature) data management.&lt;ref&gt;Healey, Richard G. (1991); ''Database Management Systems'', in Maguire, David J.; Goodchild, Michael F.; and Rhind, David W., (eds.), ''Geographic Information Systems: Principles and Applications'', London, GB: Longman&lt;/ref&gt; Related to this is the range and diversity of geographic data formats, which present unique challenges. The digital geographic data revolution is creating new types of data formats beyond the traditional "vector" and "raster" formats. Geographic data repositories increasingly include ill-structured data, such as imagery and geo-referenced multi-media.&lt;ref&gt;Camara, Antonio S.; and Raper, Jonathan (eds.) (1999); ''Spatial Multimedia and Virtual Reality'', London, GB: Taylor and Francis&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several critical research challenges in geographic knowledge discovery and data mining. Miller and Han&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Harvey J.; and Han, Jiawei (eds.) (2001); ''Geographic Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery'', London, GB: Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; offer the following list of emerging research topics in the field:
* '''Developing and supporting geographic data warehouses (GDW's)''': Spatial properties are often reduced to simple [[Theory of Forms#What are the Forms?|aspatial]] attributes in mainstream data warehouses. Creating an integrated GDW requires solving issues of spatial and temporal data interoperability – including differences in semantics, referencing systems, geometry, accuracy, and position.
* '''Better spatio-temporal representations in geographic knowledge discovery''': Current geographic knowledge discovery (GKD) methods generally use very simple representations of geographic objects and spatial relationships. Geographic data mining methods should recognize more complex geographic objects (i.e., lines and polygons) and relationships (i.e., non-Euclidean distances, direction, connectivity, and interaction through attributed geographic space such as terrain). Furthermore, the time dimension needs to be more fully integrated into these geographic representations and relationships.
* '''Geographic knowledge discovery using diverse data types''': GKD methods should be developed that can handle diverse data types beyond the traditional raster and vector models, including imagery and geo-referenced multimedia, as well as dynamic data types (video streams, animation).

==Temporal data mining==
Data may contain attributes generated and recorded at different times. In this case finding meaningful relationships in the data may require considering the temporal order of the attributes. A temporal relationship may indicate a causal relationship, or simply an association.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Sensor data mining==
[[Wireless sensor network]]s can be used for facilitating the collection of data for spatial data mining for a variety of applications such as air pollution monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ma | first1 = Y. | last2 = Richards | first2 = M. | last3 = Ghanem | first3 = M. | last4 = Guo | first4 = Y. | last5 = Hassard | first5 = J. | title = Air Pollution Monitoring and Mining Based on Sensor Grid in London | doi = 10.3390/s8063601 | journal = Sensors | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 3601 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A characteristic of such networks is that nearby sensor nodes monitoring an environmental feature typically register similar values. This kind of data redundancy due to the spatial correlation between sensor observations inspires the techniques for in-network data aggregation and mining. By measuring the spatial correlation between data sampled by different sensors, a wide class of specialized algorithms can be developed to develop more efficient spatial data mining algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ma | first1 = Y. | last2 = Guo | first2 = Y. | last3 = Tian | first3 = X. | last4 = Ghanem | first4 = M. | title = Distributed Clustering-Based Aggregation Algorithm for Spatial Correlated Sensor Networks | doi = 10.1109/JSEN.2010.2056916 | journal = IEEE Sensors Journal | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 641 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual data mining==
In the process of turning from analog into digital, large data sets have been generated, collected, and stored discovering statistical patterns, trends and information which is hidden in data, in order to build predictive patterns. Studies suggest visual data mining is faster and much more intuitive than is traditional data mining.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, Kaidi; and Liu, Bing; Tirpark, Thomas M.; and Weimin, Xiao; [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1106390 ''A Visual Data Mining Framework for Convenient Identification of Useful Knowledge'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keim, Daniel A.; [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.135.7051 ''Information Visualization and Visual Data Mining'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burch, Michael; Diehl, Stephan; Weißgerber, Peter; [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1056018.1056024 ''Visual Data Mining in Software Archives'']&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Computer vision]].

==Music data mining==
Data mining techniques, and in particular [[co-occurrence]] analysis, has been used to discover relevant similarities among music corpora (radio lists, CD databases) for purposes including classifying music into [[genres]] in a more objective manner.&lt;ref&gt;Pachet, François; Westermann, Gert; and Laigre, Damien; [http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/2001/pachet01c.pdf ''Musical Data Mining for Electronic Music Distribution''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327024728/http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/2001/pachet01c.pdf# |date=2014-03-27 }}, Proceedings of the 1st WedelMusic Conference, Firenze, Italy, 2001, pp. 101–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surveillance==
Data mining has been used by the U.S. government. Programs include the [[Total Information Awareness]] (TIA) program, Secure Flight (formerly known as Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System ([[CAPPS II]])), Analysis, Dissemination, Visualization, Insight, Semantic Enhancement ([[ADVISE]]),&lt;ref&gt;Government Accountability Office, ''Data Mining: Early Attention to Privacy in Developing a Key DHS Program Could Reduce Risks'', GAO-07-293 (February 2007), Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt; and the Multi-state Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange ([[MATRIX]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20604775/ Secure Flight Program report], MSNBC&lt;/ref&gt; These programs have been discontinued due to controversy over whether they violate the 4th Amendment to the United States Constitution, although many programs that were formed under them continue to be funded by different organizations or under different names.&lt;ref name="eff-tia-funding"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/TIA/20031003_comments.php |title=Total/Terrorism Information Awareness (TIA): Is It Truly Dead? |year=2003 |work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (official website) |accessdate=2009-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325113304/http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/TIA/20031003_comments.php |archivedate=2009-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of combating terrorism, two particularly plausible methods of data mining are "pattern mining" and "subject-based data mining".

==Pattern mining== &lt;!-- [[Pattern mining]] links to here. --&gt;
"Pattern mining" is a data mining method that involves finding existing [[pattern]]s in data. In this context ''patterns'' often means [[association rules]]. The original motivation for searching association rules came from the desire to analyze supermarket transaction data, that is, to examine customer behavior in terms of the purchased products. For example, an association rule "beer ⇒ potato chips (80%)" states that four out of five customers that bought beer also bought potato chips.

In the context of pattern mining as a tool to identify terrorist activity, the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] provides the following definition: "Pattern-based data mining looks for patterns (including anomalous data patterns) that might be associated with terrorist activity&amp;nbsp;— these patterns might be regarded as small signals in a large ocean of noise."&lt;ref&gt;Agrawal, Rakesh; Mannila, Heikki; Srikant, Ramakrishnan; Toivonen, Hannu; and Verkamo, A. Inkeri; ''Fast discovery of association rules'', in ''Advances in knowledge discovery and data mining'', MIT Press, 1996, pp. 307–328&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NRC2008"&gt;National Research Council, ''Protecting Individual Privacy in the Struggle Against Terrorists: A Framework for Program Assessment'', Washington, DC: National Academies Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haag2006"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haag |first1=Stephen |first2=Maeve |last2=Cummings |first3=Amy |last3=Phillips |title=Management Information Systems for the information age |page=28 |isbn=0-07-095569-7 |year=2006 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson |location=Toronto |oclc=63194770}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pattern Mining includes new areas such a [[Music Information Retrieval]] (MIR) where patterns seen both in the temporal and non temporal domains are imported to classical knowledge discovery search methods.

==Subject-based data mining== &lt;!-- [[Subject-based data mining]] links to here. --&gt;
"Subject-based data mining" is a data mining method involving the search for associations between individuals in data. In the context of combating terrorism, the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] provides the following definition: "Subject-based data mining uses an initiating individual or other datum that is considered, based on other information, to be of high interest, and the goal is to determine what other persons or financial transactions or movements, etc., are related to that initiating datum."&lt;ref name="NRC2008" /&gt;

==Knowledge grid==
Knowledge discovery "On the Grid" generally refers to conducting knowledge discovery in an open environment using [[grid computing]] concepts, allowing users to integrate data from various online data sources, as well make use of remote resources, for executing their data mining tasks. The earliest example was the [[Discovery Net]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Ghanem | first1 = Moustafa | last2 = Guo | first2 = Yike | last3 = Rowe | first3 = Anthony | last4 = Wendel | first4 = Patrick | chapter = Grid-based knowledge discovery services for high throughput informatics | doi = 10.1109/HPDC.2002.1029946 | title = Proceedings 11th IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing | pages = 416 | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-7695-1686-6 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Ghanem | first1 = Moustafa | last2 = Curcin | first2 = Vasa | last3 = Wendel | first3 = Patrick | last4 = Guo | first4 = Yike | chapter = Building and Using Analytical Workflows in Discovery Net | doi = 10.1002/9780470699904.ch8 | title = Data Mining Techniques in Grid Computing Environments | pages = 119 | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780470699904 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed at [[Imperial College London]], which won the "Most Innovative Data-Intensive Application Award" at the ACM SC02 (Supercomputing 2002) conference and exhibition, based on a demonstration of a fully interactive distributed knowledge discovery application for a bioinformatics application. Other examples include work conducted by researchers at the [[University of Calabria]], who developed a Knowledge Grid architecture for distributed knowledge discovery, based on [[grid computing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cannataro, Mario |author2=Talia, Domenico |title=The Knowledge Grid: An Architecture for Distributed Knowledge Discovery |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=46 |number=1 |date=January 2003 |pages=89–93 |doi=10.1145/602421.602425 |url=http://grid.deis.unical.it/papers/pdf/CACM2003.pdf |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Talia, Domenico |author2=Trunfio, Paolo |title=How distributed data mining tasks can thrive as knowledge services |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=53 |number=7 |date=July 2010 |pages=132–137 |doi=10.1145/1785414.1785451 |url=http://grid.deis.unical.it/papers/pdf/CACM2010.pdf |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''heat sealer''' is a [[machine]] used to [[seal (mechanical)|seal]] [[product (business)|product]]s, [[packaging]], and other [[thermoplastic]] materials using [[heat]].  This can be with uniform thermoplastic monolayers or with materials having several layers, at least one being thermoplastic. Heat sealing can join two similar materials together or can join dissimilar materials, one of which has a thermoplastic layer.

==Heat sealing process==
'''Heat sealing''' is the process of sealing one [[thermoplastic]] to another similar thermoplastic using heat and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;
The direct contact method of heat sealing utilizes a constantly heated die or sealing bar to apply heat to a specific contact area or path to seal or weld the thermoplastics together. Heat sealing is used for many applications, including heat seal connectors, thermally activated adhesives, film media, plastic ports or [[foil sealing]].

===Applications for the heat sealing process===

Heat seal connectors are used to join [[LCD]]s to [[Printed circuit board|PCBs]] in many [[consumer electronics]], as well as in [[medical]] and [[telecommunication]] devices.

Heat sealing of products with thermal adhesives is used to hold clear display screens onto consumer electronic products and for other sealed thermo-plastic assemblies or devices where [[heat staking]] or [[ultrasonic welding]] are not an option due to part design requirements or other assembly considerations.

Heat sealing also is used in the manufacturing of bloodtest film and filter media for the blood, virus and many other test strip devices used in the medical field today. [[Laminate]] foils and films often are heat sealed over the top of thermoplastic medical trays, Microtiter (microwell) plates, bottles and containers to seal and/or prevent contamination for medical test devices, sample collection trays and containers used for food products.

Medical and fluid bags used in the medical, [[bioengineering]] and food industries. Fluid bags are made out of a multitude of varying materials such as foils, filter media, thermoplastics and laminates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hishinuma|first1=Kazuo|title=Heat Sealing Technology and Engineering for Packaging|date=1 January 2009|publisher=DEStech Publications, Inc|location=Lancaster, PA|isbn=978-1-932078-85-5|page=267|edition=1st|url=http://www.destechpub.com/index.php?fuseAction=catalogs.viewItem&amp;catalogID=1&amp;catalogLevelID=&amp;catalogItemID=63|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of heat sealing==

*Hot bar sealers- have heated tooling kept at a constant temperature (also known as Direct Contact Thermal Sealing).  They use one or more heated bars, irons, or dies which contact the material to heat the interface and form a bond. The bars, irons and dies have various configurations and can be covered with a release layer or utilize various slick interposer materials (i.e. Teflon films) to prevent sticking to the hot tooling.
*Continuous heat sealers- (also known as Band type heat sealers) utilize [[moving belt]]s over heating elements.
*Impulse heat sealers- have heating elements (one or two) of [[Nichrome]] placed between a resilient [[synthetic rubber]] and a release surface of film or fabric.  The heating elements are not continuously heated; heat is generated only when current flows.  When the materials are placed in the heat sealer, they are held in place by pressure.  An electric current heats the heating element for a specified time to create the required temperature.  the Jaws hold the material in place after the heat is stopped, sometimes with cooling water:  this allows the material to fuse before stress can be applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

*[[Hot melt adhesive]] can be applied in strips or beads at the point of joining.   It can also be applied to one of the surfaces during an earlier manufacturing step and reactivated for bonding.
* Hot wire sealing – involves a heated wire that both cuts the surfaces and joins them with a molten edge bead.  This is not usually employed when barrier properties are critical.
*[[Induction sealing]] is a non-contact type of sealing used for inner seals in bottle caps.
*[[Induction welding]] heat sealing by non-contact induction
* [[Ultrasonic welding]] uses high-frequency ultrasonic acoustic vibrations to workpieces being held together under pressure to create a weld.

A type of heat sealer is also used to piece together plastic side panels for light-weight [[agriculture|agricultural]] buildings such as [[greenhouse]]s and [[shed]]s. This version is guided along the floor by four wheels.

In addition, [[package testing]] is used to determine the ability of completed packages to withstand specified pressure or vacuum.  Several methods are available to determine the ability of a sealed package to retain its integrity, barrier characteristics, and sterility.

Heat sealing processes can be controlled by a variety of [[quality management system]]s such as [[HACCP]], [[statistical process control]], [[ISO 9000]], etc. [[Verification and validation]] protocols are used to ensure that specifications are met and final materials/packages are suited for end-use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Seal Strength Testing==
The efficacy of heat seals is often detailed in governing [[specification]]s, [[contract]]s, and [[regulation]]s. [[Quality management system]]s sometimes ask for periodic subjective evaluations:  For example, some seals can be evaluated by a simple pull to determine the existence of a bond and the mechanism of failure.  With some plastic films, observation can be enhanced by using [[polarized light]] which highlights the [[birefringence]] of the heat seal. Some seals for sensitive products require thorough [[verification and validation]] protocols that use quantitative testing. Test methods might include:

===Seal Strength per ASTM F88 and F2824===
Seal Strength testing, also known as Peel Testing, measures the strength of seals within flexible [[wikt:barrier|barrier]] materials. This measurement can then be used to determine consistency within the seal, as well as evaluation of the opening force of the package system. Seal strength is a quantitative measure for use in process validation, process control and capability. Seal strength is not only relevant to opening force and package integrity, but to measuring the packaging processes’ ability to produce consistent seals.

===Burst and Creep per ASTM F1140 and F2054===
The [[wikt:burst|burst]] test is used to determine the packages strength and precession. The burst test is performed by pressurizing the package until it bursts. The results for the burst test include the burst pressure data and a description of where the seal failure occurred. This test method covers the burst test as defined in ASTM F1140.The [[Creep (deformation)|Creep]] test determines the packages ability to hold pressure for an extended period. The creep test is performed by setting the pressure at about 80% of the minimum burst pressure of a previous burst test. The time to seal failure or a pre-set time is measured.

===[[Vacuum]] Dye per ASTM D3078===
Determination of package [[integrity]]. The package is submerged in a transparent container filled with a mixture of water and dye. Vacuum is created inside the container and maintained for a specific length of time. When the vacuum is released, any punctured packages will draw in dye revealing the imperfect seal.

'''Chinese imperial examinations'''&lt;!--chinese in infobox--&gt; were a [[civil service]] [[examination system]] in [[History of China#Imperial China|Imperial China]] to select candidates for the state [[Civil service#China|bureaucracy]]. Imperial exams existed as early as the [[Han dynasty]], however they were only utilized as a means of recruitment for government office in the mid-[[Tang dynasty]], and remained so until its abolition in 1905. The exams were based on knowledge of the classics and literary style. The Confucian examination syllabus has been compared to the [[Renaissance Humanism|humanist education]] central to contemporary European government service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Berkshire Encyclopedia of China|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~elman/documents/Civil%20Service%20Examinations.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased reliance on the exam system was partially responsible for China's shift away from a [[military aristocracy]] to a [[gentry]] class of [[scholar-bureaucrats]]. Starting with the [[Song dynasty]], the system was regularized and developed into a roughly three-tiered ladder from local to provincial to court exams. The content was narrowed and fixed on texts of [[Neo-Confucian]] orthodoxy. By the [[Ming dynasty]], the highest degree, the ''[[#Degree types|jinshi]]'' ({{zh|t=[[wikt:進士|進士]]}}), became essential for highest office. On the other hand, the initial degree, the ''[[shengyuan]]'' ([[wikt:生員|生員]]), became vastly oversupplied, resulting in holders who could not hope for office, yet were still granted social privilege. 

The Chinese examination system spread to neighboring Asian countries, such as [[Vietnam]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]] (though briefly) &lt;!-- please do not remove Japan, this imperial examination system existed in Japan, it was used during the eighth to tenth centuries, its subjects include xiucai, mingjing, jinshi, mingfa, as well as medicine and acupuncture.--&gt;and [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryūkyū]]. The Chinese examination system was introduced to the Western world in the reports of [[Europeans in Medieval China|European missionaries and diplomats]] and likely had an influencing the [[British East India Company]]'s introduction of similar methods to select prospective employees. Following the initial success in that company, the British government adopted a similar testing system for screening civil servants in 1855. Other European nations, such as France and Germany, followed suit. Modeled after these previous adaptations, the United States established its own testing program for certain government jobs after 1883.

Critics charged that the examination system stifled creativity and created officials who dared not defy authority, yet the system also continued to promote cultural unity. Wealthy families, especially from the merchant class, could opt into the system by educating their sons or purchasing degrees. In the 19th century, critics blamed the imperial system, and in the process its examinations, for China's lack of technical knowledge and its defeat by foreign powers.

==General history==
{{Further|Imperial examination in Chinese mythology}}
The imperial examination system in its classical manifestation is historically attested to have been established in 605, during the [[Sui dynasty]], when the emperor could call for tests to be administered. In the following [[Tang dynasty]], tests were used on a small scale until the examination system was extensively expanded during the reign of [[Wu Zetian]]:&lt;ref&gt;Paludin, 97&lt;/ref&gt; the impact of Wu's use of the testing system is still a matter for scholarly debate. However most government posts were still recruited through personal recommendation and connections to the court. It was not until the [[Song dynasty]] that most officials were recruited through examination. The Song emperors expanded both examinations and the government school system so that the number of those who passed the exams expanded to four to five times that of the Tang. Thus the system played a key role in the selection of the scholar-officials, who formed the elite members of society. During the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, the system contributed to the narrowness of intellectual life and the autocratic power of the emperor. The system continued with some modifications until its 1905 abolition under the Qing dynasty. Other brief interruptions to the system occurred, such as at the beginning of the [[Yuan dynasty]] in the 13th century. The modern examination system for selecting civil servants also indirectly evolved from the imperial one.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Buckley Ebrey, ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of China'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2nd Ed., 2010), 145–147, 198–200,&lt;/ref&gt;

The operations of the examination system were part of the imperial record keeping system, and the date of receiving the ''jinshi'' degree is often a key biographical datum: sometimes the date of achieving ''jinshi'' is the only firm date known for even some of the most historically prominent persons in Chinese history. The regular higher level degree examination cycle was nominally decreed in 1067 to be 3 years. In practice both before and after this, the examinations were irregularly implemented for significant periods of time: thus, the calculated statistical averages for the number of degrees conferred annually should be understood in this context. The ''jinshi'' tests were not a yearly event and should not be considered so; the annual average figures are a necessary artifact of quantitative analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 252&lt;/ref&gt;

===Han dynasty===
Candidates for offices recommended by the prefect of prefecture were examined by the [[minister of ceremony]] and then presented to the emperor.&lt;ref name="Fu"&gt;Autocratic Tradition and Chinese Politics – Zhengyuan Fu&lt;/ref&gt; Some candidates for clerical positions would be given a test determine whether they could memorize nine thousand Chinese characters.&lt;ref name="Fu"/&gt; The imperial examinations during the [[Han dynasty]] did not offer a formal entry into government posts. Recruitment and appointment in the Han dynasty was primarily through recommendations by [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s and local officials. Recommended individuals were also primarily aristocrats. In theory, recommendations were based on a combination of reputation and ability but it's not certain how well this worked in practice. Oral examinations on policy issues were sometimes conducted personally by the emperor himself during Western Han times.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, 57&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 165 BC [[Emperor Wen of Han]] introduced recruitment to the [[civil service examination|civil service through examinations]], however these did not heavily emphasize Confucian material. Previously, potential officials never sat for any sort of academic [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 87&lt;/ref&gt;

While the examinations expanded under the Han, the number of graduates who went on to hold office were few. The examinations did not offer a formal route to commissioned office and the primary path to office remained through recommendations. Though connections and recommendations remained more meaningful than the exam, the initiation of the examination system by Emperor Wu had a cultural significance, as the state determined the most important examination material were Confucian. During the Han dynasty, these examinations were primarily used for the purpose of classifying candidates who had been specifically recommended. Even during the Tang dynasty the quantity of placements into government service through the examination system only averaged about nine persons per year, with the known maximum being less than 25 in any given year.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 253&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three Kingdoms era through the Sui dynasty===
Beginning in the [[Three Kingdoms]] period (with the [[nine-rank system]] in the [[Cao Wei|Kingdom of Wei]]), imperial officials were responsible for assessing the quality of the talents recommended by the local elites. This system continued until it was abolished in 587 by [[Emperor Wen of Sui]] who created a system wherein every prefecture would supply three scholars a year.&lt;ref name="fu"&gt;{{cite book|title=Autocratic Tradition and Chinese Politics|last=Zhengyuan|first= Fu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In AD 605 [[Emperor Yang of Sui]] established a new category of recommended candidates for the mandarinate (进士科). For the first time, an examination system was explicitly instituted for a category of local talents. However, the Sui dynasty was short-lived, and the system did not reach its mature development until afterwards.

===Tang dynasty and Wu interregnum===
[[File:Exam cells model.jpg|thumb|275px|A model of exam cells displayed at [[Guozijian (Beijing)|Beijing Imperial Academy]]]]

Over the course of the Tang dynasty (唐朝) and during the Zhou dynasty of the [[Wu Zetian]] interregnum, the examination system developed into a more comprehensive system, developing beyond the basic Sui process of qualifying candidates based on questions on policy matters and then followed by an interview.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, 55&lt;/ref&gt; Oral interviews as part of the examination and selection system were theoretically supposed to be an unbiased process, but in practice favored candidates from elite clans based in the capitals of [[Chang'an]] and [[Luoyang]] (speakers of solely non-elite dialects could not succeed).&lt;ref&gt;任立达，薛希洪，"中国古代官吏考选制度史" (''A History of the Examination Systems for the Chinese Imperial Mandarinate'')(青岛出版社, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Keay|first=John|title=China&amp;nbsp;— A History|year=2009|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0-00-722178-3}} p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

The civil-service examination was institutionalized, where six categories were created. Eventually these became just one ''[[jinshi degree|jinshi]]'' degree.&lt;ref name="fu"/&gt; Although the number of candidates were sometimes as high as 2,000 a year, only 1 to 2 percent passed the test. At this point the exam became administered by the [[Ministry of Rites]].

A pivotal point in the development of imperial examinations arose with the rise of Wu Zetian.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 253&lt;/ref&gt; Up until that point, the rulers of the Tang dynasty were all male members of the Li family (李氏). Wu Zetian was exceptional: a woman not of the Li family, she came to occupy the seat of the emperor in an official manner in the year of 690, and even beforehand she had already begun to stretch her power within the imperial courts behind the scenes. Reform of the imperial examinations to include a new class of elite bureaucrats derived from humbler origins became a keystone of Wu's gamble to retain power.

In 655, Wu Zetian graduated 44 candidates with the ''jìnshì'' degree (進士), and during one 7-year period the annual average of exam takers graduated with a ''jinshi'' degree was greater than 58 persons per year. Wu lavished favors on the newly graduated ''jinshi'' degree-holders, increasing the prestige associated with this path of attaining a government career, and clearly began a process of opening up opportunities to success for a wider population pool, including inhabitants of China's less prestigious southeast area.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 253&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Li family supporters were located to the northwest, particularly around the capital city of Chang'an. Wu's progressive accumulation of political power through enhancement of the examination system involved attaining the allegiance of previously under-represented regions, alleviating frustrations of the literati, and encouraging education in various locales so even people in the remote corners of the empire would work on their studies in order to pass the imperial exams, and thus developed a nucleus of elite bureaucrats useful from the perspective of control by the central government.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 254&lt;/ref&gt;

In 681, a written test on knowledge of the Confucian classics was introduced, meaning that candidates were required to memorize these works and fill in the blanks on the test.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

In 693, Wu Zetian's government further expanded the civil service examination system,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Paludan|first=Ann|title=Chronicle of the Chinese Emperors: The Reign-by-Reign Record of the Rulers of Imperial China|year=1998|publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=0-500-05090-2}} p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; part of a policy to reform society and to consolidate power for her self-proclaimed "Zhou dynasty". Examples of officials whom she recruited through her reformed examination system include [[Zhang Yue (Tang dynasty)|Zhang Yue]], [[Li Jiao (Tang dynasty)|Li Jiao]], and [[Shen Quanqi]]. She introduced major changes in regard to the Tang system, increasing the pool of candidates permitted to take the test by allowing commoners and gentry previously disqualified by their non-elite backgrounds to attempt the tests. Successful candidates then became an elite nucleus of bureaucrats within her government.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime between 730 and 740, after the Tang restoration, a section requiring the composition of original poetry (including both ''[[Shi (poetry)|shi]]'' and ''[[Fu (poetry)|fu]]'') was added to the tests, with rather specific set requirements: this was for the ''jinshi'' degree, as well as certain other tests. The less-esteemed examinations tested for skills such as mathematics, law, and calligraphy. The success rate on these tests of knowledge on the classics was between 10 and 20 percent, but for the thousand or more candidates going for a ''jinshi'' degree each year in which it was offered, the success rate for the examinees was only between 1 and 2 percent: a total of 6504 ''jinshi'' were created during course of the Tang dynasty (an average of only about 23 ''jinshi'' awarded per year).&lt;ref&gt;Yu, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early years of the Tang restoration, the following emperors expanded on Wu's policies since they found them politically useful, and the annual averages of degrees conferred continued to rise; however with the upheavals which later developed and the disintegration of the Tang empire into the "[[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]", the examination system gave ground to other traditional routes to government positions and favoritism in grading reduced the opportunities of those taking the tests who lacked political patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 254&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically this period of fragmentation resulted in the utter destruction of old networks established by elite families that had ruled China throughout its various dynasties since its very conception. With the disappearance of the old aristocracy, Wu's system of bureaucrat recruitment once more became the dominant model in China, and eventually coalesced into the class of nonhereditary elites who would become known to the West as "mandarins," in reference to [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], the dialect of Chinese employed in the imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-civil-service |title=Chinese civil service |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date= 19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Song dynasty===
[[File:Palastexamen-SongDynastie.jpg|thumb|400px|The emperor receives a candidate during the Palace Examination. Song dynasty.]]

In the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) more than a hundred higher level examinations were held. Officials selected through the exams became dominant in the bureaucracy. The number of ''jinshi'' degrees also increased.&lt;ref name="fu"/&gt; Theoretically, the examinations were open to adult (at least in terms of literacy) Chinese males, with some restrictions. This included even individuals from the occupied northern territories.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 257 (Table 2, which shows 26 doctoral degrees awarded in 1184 to individuals from Occupied North China, and 1 in 1256)&lt;/ref&gt; Many individuals moved from a low social status to political prominence through success in imperial examination. Examples include [[Wang Anshi]], who proposed reforms to make the exams more practical, and [[Zhu Xi]], whose interpretations of the [[Four Books and Five Classics|Four Classics]] became the orthodox [[Neo-Confucianism]] which dominated later dynasties. Two other prominent successful entries into politics through the examination system were [[Su Shi]] and his brother [[Su Zhe]]: both of whom became political opponents of Wang Anshi. Indeed, one of the major objectives of the examination system was to promote diversity of viewpoints and to avoid over-filling of offices with individuals of particular political or partisan alignment, as might occur with alternative, more biased methods, which could allow for active recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;de Bary (1960), 391&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the process of studying for the examination tended to be time-consuming and costly, requiring time to spare and tutors. Most of the candidates came from the numerically small but relatively wealthy land-owning [[scholar-official]] class.&lt;ref&gt;Gernet, Jacques. (1962) ''Daily Life in China on the Eve of the Mongol Invasion, 1250–1276''. Translated by H.M. Wright (Stanford: Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0720-0}}, p. 65).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 937, by the decision of the Taizu Emperor of Song, the palace examination was supervised by the emperor himself. In 992, the practice of anonymous submission of papers during the palace examination was introduced; it was spread to the departmental examinations in 1007, and to the prefectural level in 1032. The practice of recopying the papers in order not to allow biases by revealing the candidate by his calligraphy was introduced at the capital and departmental level in 1105, and in the prefectures in 1037.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, Benjamin A. ''A Cultural History of Civil Examinations in Late Imperial China'', 2000:14.
&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics indicate that the Song imperial government degree-awards eventually more than doubled the highest annual averages of those awarded during the Tang dynasty, with 200 or more per year on average being common, and at times reaching a per annum figure of almost 240.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 254&lt;/ref&gt;

Various reforms or attempts to reform the examination system were made during the Song dynasty, including by [[Fan Zhongyan]] and those by Wang Anshi. Fan's memorial to the throne actually initiated a process which lead to major educational reform through the establishment of a comprehensive public school system.&lt;ref&gt;de Bary (1960), 393–394&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yuan dynasty (the Mongols)===
Governmental examinations ended with the defeat of the Song in 1279 by a disintegrating [[Mongol empire]]. After a period of turmoil, the part of the Mongol empire that was led by [[Kublai Khan]] established itself in China as the [[Yuan dynasty]]. One of Kublai's main advisers in this event was [[ Liu Bingzhong]], who wrote a memorial, among other things, recommending restoration of the examination system: however, this was not done.&lt;ref&gt;Rossari 1988, 30&lt;/ref&gt; Kublai ended the imperial examination system, as he believed that Confucian learning was not needed for government jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy, Frey. History Alive!: The Medieval World and beyond. Palo Alto, CA: Teacher's Curriculum Institute, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Kublai was opposed to such a commitment to the Chinese language and to the Chinese scholars who were so adept, together with the accompanying ideology: he wished to appoint his own people without relying on an apparatus inherited from a newly conquered and sometimes rebellious country.&lt;ref&gt;Rossari 1988, 71&lt;/ref&gt; The discontinuation of the exams had the affect of reducing the prestige of traditional learning, reducing the motivation for doing so, as well as encouraging new literary directions not motivated by the old means of literary development and success.&lt;ref&gt;Rossari 1988: 116, 161&lt;/ref&gt;

The examination system was revived in 1315, with significant changes, during the reign of [[Emperor Renzong of Yuan|Emperor Renzong]]. The new examination system was one of regionalism with Mongol characteristics. The northern areas of Mongolia and its vicinity were favored, and a quota system (both for number of candidates and number of degrees awarded) which was based on the classification of the imperial population into four [[Race (human classification)|racially-based groups]] (or [[castes]] and/or [[Ethnic group|ethnicities]]) was instituted, the groups being Mongols, their non-Han allies ([[Semu|Semu-ren]]), Northern Chinese, and Southern Chinese, with further restrictions by province.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 263&lt;/ref&gt; Under the revived and revised system the yearly averages for examination degrees awarded was about 21.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 263&lt;/ref&gt; As the degrees were arithmetically divided between the four "races" (although with further modification), rather than being proportionally based on either population or number of qualified candidates, this tended to favor the Mongols, Semu-ren, and North Chinese: the South Chinese were by far the greatest part of the population, the 1290 census figures recording some 12,000,000 households (about 48% of the total Yuan population), versus 2,000,000 North Chinese households, and the populations of Mongols and Semu-ren were both less.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 263&lt;/ref&gt; The restrictions on candidates by the new quota system allowed only 300 candidates for each testing session of the three year examination cycle. The provincial restrictions resulted in a greater effect; for example, only 28 Han Chinese from South China were included among the 300 candidates, the rest of the South China slots (47) being occupied by resident Mongols or Semu-ren, although 47 "racial South Chinese" who were not residents of South China were approved as candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 263, and note 17, page 391&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ming dynasty===
[[Image:Portrait of Jiang Shunfu.jpg|right|thumb|220px|A 15th-century portrait of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] official [[Jiang Shunfu]]. The two [[Crane (bird)|cranes]] on his chest are a "[[Mandarin square]]" for a civil official of the first rank.]]
The [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644) retained and expanded the system it inherited. Shortly after the inauguration of the dynasty, the [[Hongwu Emperor]] in 1370 declared that the exams should cover the [[Four Books]], discourses, and political analysis, accepting the Neo-Confucian canon put forth by [[Zhu Xi]] in the Song dynasty. But he firmly insisted on including the martial arts.
The curriculum at the [[Guozijian]] (National Academy){{which|date=August 2018}} emphasized law, mathematics, calligraphy, [[equestrianism|horse riding]], and archery in addition to Confucian classics required in the exams.&lt;ref name="Langlois988"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor1=Frederick W. Mote|editor2=Denis Twitchett|author-first = Jack|author-last = Langlois| chapter = The Hung-wu Reign, 1368–1398| title=The Cambridge History of China: Volume 7, The Ming Dynasty, 1368–1644|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tyhT9SZRLS8C&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q=archery&amp;f=false|date=26 February 1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-24332-2|pages=122–}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor especially emphasized archery.&lt;ref name="Selby2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Selby|title=Chinese Archery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wY3sAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA267&amp;dq=yuanzhang+archery&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiI9c_n7b7MAhXkzoMKHcLRDCYQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=yuanzhang%20archery&amp;f=false|date=1 January 2000|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-962-209-501-4|pages=267–}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The three levels of examination were created during this period, whose degrees were in order, ''[[shengyuan]]'' (elementary), ''[[juren]]'' (provincial), and ''[[jinshi degree|jinshi]]'' (metropolitan examination).&lt;ref name="fu"/&gt;

The Ming established Neo-Confucian interpretations as the orthodoxy guidelines and created what the historian [[Benjamin Elman]] called a "single-minded and monocular political ideology" that "affected politically and socially how literati learning would be interpreted and used." The imperial civil service system adopted this rigid orthodoxy at a time when commercialization and population growth meant that there was an inflation in the number of degree candidates at the lower levels. As a result, the higher and more prestigious offices were dominated by ''jinshi '' (Palace) degree-holders, who tended to come from elite families. The Ming thus started a process in which access to government office became harder and harder and officials became more and more orthodox in their thought. Near the end of the Ming dynasty, in 1600, there were roughly half a million licentiates in a population of 150 million, that is, one per 300 people; by the mid-19th century the ratio had shrunk to one civil licentiate for each 1,000 people.{{sfnb|Elman|2009| pp = 408–409}}

The social background of metropolitan graduates also narrowed as time went on. In the early years of the Ming dynasty only 14 percent of metropolitan graduates came from families that had a history of providing officials, while in the last years of the Ming roughly 60 percent of metropolitan exam graduates came from established elite families.

===Qing dynasty===
[[File:Xu Yang - Examination hall.jpg|thumb|250px|Examination hall, ''[[Prosperous Suzhou]]'' by [[Xu Yang (Qing dynasty)|Xu Yang]], 1759]]
The Qing dynasty largely adopted the Ming civil-service exam in the year of its establishment, 1644. The ''shengyuan'' degree holders were given some tax exemptions from the general public. During the Qing dynasty a total of 112 ''jinshi'' examinations were held within 261 years (1644–1905), averaging 2.3 years per exam and 102 ''jinshi'' degrees conferred a year.&lt;ref&gt;Ho 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]], which attempted to overthrow the Qing dynasty in the middle of the 19th century, in 1853 admitted for the first time women as examination candidates. The exams administered by the Heavenly Kingdom differed from those administered by the Qing dynasty, in that they required knowledge of the [[Bible]]. [[Fu Shanxiang]] took the exam and became the first female [[zhuangyuan]] in Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Jiaqi (Grace Chor Yi Wong tr.) | last =Mao | chapter =Fu Shanxiang| pages =43–45| title =Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Women | series = | volume = | editor =Ho Clara Wing-chug, ed.| location = Armonk, NY| publisher =Sharpe | year =1998 | isbn =0765600439|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uwPWtJ5WSQMC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=Fu+Shanxiang&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a7BAdVeayl&amp;sig=5EUfk3kCuq0-LrJApSYZBwItt78&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=e1zLU49ahqTIBMeFgvgO&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Fu%20Shanxiang&amp;f=false|ref = none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The end of the imperial examination system===
With the military defeats in the 1890s and pressure to develop a national school system, reformers such as [[Kang Youwei]] and [[Liang Qichao]] called for abolition of the exams, and the [[Hundred Days' Reform]] of 1898 proposed a set of modernizations. After the [[Boxer Rebellion]], the government drew up plans to reform under the name of [[New Policies]], then abolish the exams. On 2 September 1905, the throne endorsed a [[memorial to the throne|memorial]] which ordered that the old examination system be discontinued at all levels in the following years. The new system provided equivalents to the old degrees; a bachelor's degree, for instance, would be considered equivalent to the ''xiu cai''. The details of the new system remained to be worked out by the fall of the dynasty in 1911, but the end of the system meant the end of Confucianism as an official state ideology and of the [[scholar official]] as a legal group.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Franke, ''The Reform and Abolition of the Traditional Chinese Examination System'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: East Asian Research Center, 1968), 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General discussion of late imperial system==
Reformers charged that the set format of the "[[Eight-legged essay]]" stifled original thought and satirists portrayed the rigidity of the system in novels such as ''[[Rulin waishi]]''. In the twentieth century, the [[New Culture Movement]] portrayed the examination system as a cause for China's weakness in such stories as [[Lu Xun]]'s "[[Kong Yiji]]." Some have suggested that limiting the topics prescribed in examination system removed the incentives for Chinese intellectuals to learn mathematics or to conduct experimentation, perhaps contributing to the [[Great Divergence]], in which China's scientific and economic development fell behind Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Yifu Lin, ''Demystifying the Chinese Economy'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. xiv, [http://assets.cambridge.org/97805211/91807/frontmatter/9780521191807_frontmatter.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the political and ethical theories of Confucian classical curriculum has been compared to the [[classical studies]] of [[Renaissance Humanism|humanism]] in European nations which proved instrumental in selecting an "all-rounded" top-level leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elman |first1=Benjamin A. |title=Berkshire Encyclopedia of China |date=2009 |publisher=Berkshire Publishing Group LLC |isbn=9780977015948 |pages=405 |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~elman/documents/Civil%20Service%20Examinations.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; British and French civil service examinations adopted in the late 19th century were also heavily based on Greco-Roman classical subjects and general cultural studies, as well as assessing personal physique and character.

In [[late imperial China]], the examination system was the major mechanism by which the central government captured and held the loyalty of local-level elites. Their loyalty, in turn, ensured the integration of the Chinese state, and countered tendencies toward regional autonomy and the breakup of the centralized system.  The examination system distributed its prizes according to provincial and prefectural quotas, which meant that imperial officials were recruited from the whole country, in numbers roughly proportional to each province's population. Elite individuals all over China, even in the disadvantaged peripheral regions, had a chance at succeeding in the examinations and achieving the rewards and emoluments office brought.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, John King and Merle Goldman. (2006) ''China: A New History''. (Cambridge: MA; London: Harvard University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-674-01828-1}}), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The examination based civil service thus promoted stability and social mobility. The Confucian-based examinations meant that the local elites and ambitious would-be members of those elites across the whole of China were taught with similar values.  Even though only a small fraction (about 5 percent) of those who attempted the examinations actually passed them and even fewer received titles, the hope of eventual success sustained their commitment. Those who failed to pass did not lose wealth or local social standing; as dedicated believers in Confucian orthodoxy, they served, without the benefit of state appointments, as teachers, patrons of the arts, and managers of local projects, such as irrigation works, schools, or charitable foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, John King and Merle Goldman. (2006) ''China: A New History'' (Cambridge: MA; London: Harvard University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-674-01828-1}}), pp. 101–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of China===
{{See also|History of the Republic of China}}

After the fall of the Qing in 1911, Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]], the leader of the newly risen [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]], developed similar procedures for the new political system through an institution called the [[Examination Yuan]], one of the five branches of government, although this was quickly suspended due to the turmoil in China between the two world wars, such as the warlord period and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion]]. The [[Kuomintang]] administration revived the Examination Yuan in 1947 after the defeat of Japan. This system continues into present times in Taiwan along with the government itself after loss of the mainland to the [[Communist Party of China]].

==Taking the exams==
[[Image:Imperial examination cheating material.JPG|thumb|widthpx|"Cribbing Garment" worn as underwear into the examination]]

The examinations consisted of tests administered at the district, provincial, and metropolitan levels. Tight quotas restricted the number of successful candidates at each level—for example, only three hundred students could pass the metropolitan examinations. Students often took the examinations several times before earning a degree.

* Entry-level examinations were held annually and accessible to educated individuals from their early teenage years.  These were held locally and were collectively called '''''Tóngshì''''' ([[wikt: 童試|童試]], "Child Exam").  ''Háizi kǎoshì'' was broken down hierarchically into the '''''Xiànshì''''' ([[wikt:縣試|縣試]], "County Exam"), the '''''Fǔshì''''' ([[wikt:府試|府試]], "Prefectural exam") and '''''Yuànshì''''' ([[wikt:院試|院試]], "college exam").
* Provincial exams: '''''Xiāngshì''''' ([[wikt:鄉試|鄉試]], "township exam") were held every three years in provincial capitals.
* Metropolitan exams: '''''Huìshì''''' ([[wikt:會試|會試]], "conference exam") were held every three years in the national capital.
* Palace exams: '''''Diànshì''''' ([[wikt:殿試|殿試]], "court exam") were held every three years in the [[Forbidden City|Imperial palace]] and often supervised by the emperor himself.

Each candidate arrived at an examination compound with only a few amenities: a water pitcher, a [[chamber pot]], bedding, food (which he had to prepare himself), an [[inkstone]], [[inkstick|ink]] and [[ink brush|brushes]]. Guards verified a student's identity and searched for hidden printed materials.  In the Ming and Qing periods, each exam taker spent three days and two nights writing "[[eight-legged essay]]s"—literary compositions with eight distinct sections—in a tiny room with a makeshift bed, desk and bench. There were no interruptions during those three days, nor were candidates allowed any communication.  If a candidate died, officials wrapped his body in a straw mat and tossed it over the high walls that ringed the compound.&lt;ref&gt;Ichisada Miyazaki. ''China's Examination Hell: The Civil Service Examinations of Imperial China.'' (New York: Weatherhill,  1976. {{ISBN|0834801043}}), pp. 18–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intense [[pressure to succeed]] meant that [[cheating]] and [[corruption in China|corruption]] were rampant, often outrunning strenuous attempts to prevent or defeat them. The Ming-dynasty ''[[Book of Swindles]]'' (c. 1617) contains an entire section of stories about "Corruption in Education", most of which involve swindlers exploiting exam-takers' desperate attempts to bribe the examiner.&lt;ref&gt;"Type 20: Corruption in Education," in Zhang Yingyu, ''The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection'', translated by Christopher Rea and Bruce Rusk (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2017), pp. 142–163.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to discourage favoritism which might occur if an examiner recognized a student's calligraphy, each exam was recopied by an official copyist.  Exact quotes from [[Four Books and Five Classics|the classics]] were required; misquoting even one character or writing it in the wrong form meant failure, so candidates went to great lengths to bring hidden copies of these texts with them, sometimes written on their underwear.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew H. Plaks]],  [http://www.princeton.edu/~ealj/robe.htm  "Cribbing Garment" Gest Library]'''&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Minneapolis Institute of Arts]] holds an example of a Qing dynasty [[cheat sheet]], a handkerchief with 10,000 characters of Confucian classics in microscopically small handwriting.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85gAfiJGpVM&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details of the imperial examination==
===Curriculum===
By 115 AD, a set curriculum had become established for the so-called First Generation of examination takers. They were tested on their proficiency in the "[[Six Arts]]":

* Scholastic arts: music, arithmetic, writing, and knowledge of the rituals and ceremonies in both public and private life.
* Militaristic: archery and horsemanship

The curriculum was then expanded to cover the "Five Studies": military strategy, civil law, revenue and taxation, agriculture and geography, and the [[Confucian classics]]. In this form, the examinations were institutionalized during the sixth century AD, under the [[Sui dynasty]]. These examinations are regarded by most historians as the first [[standardized tests]] based on merit.

===Degree types===
[[File:状元卷.JPG|thumb|Exam paper of Ming dynasty [[Zhuangyuan]] Zhao Bing-zhong in 1598 AD]]
[[File:陳悅記祖宅舉人竿.jpg|thumb|Stone flagpole planted at the examiner's abode indicating the jinshi imperial examination status]]
By the [[Ming dynasty]], the examinations and degrees formed a "ladder of success", with success generally being equated with being graduated as ''[[jinshi]]'', a degree similar to a modern Doctor of Literature degree, or [[PhD]]. Modifications to the basic ''jinshi'' or other degree were made for higher-placing graduates, similar to the modern [[Summa cum laude]]. The examination process extended down to the county level, and included examinations at the provincial and national levels. The highest level tests would be at the imperial court or palace level, of which the ''jinshi'' was the highest regular level, although special purpose tests were occasionally offered, by imperial decree:

* '''''Tongsheng''''' ([[wikt:童生|童生]], lit. "child student"),  an entry-level examinee who had passed the county/prefecture exams.
* '''''[[Shengyuan]]''''' ([[wikt:生員|生員]], lit. "student member"), also commonly called '''''xiucai''''' ([[wikt:秀才|秀才]], lit. "distinguished talent"), an entry-level [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] who had passed the college exam.  ''Xiucai'' enjoyed officially sanctioned social privileges such as exemption from [[Corvée|statute labour]], access into local government facilities and limited immunity against [[corporal punishment]]s.  They were further divided into three classes according to exam performance.
** '''''Linsheng''''' ([[wikt:廩生|廩生]], lit. "granary student"), the first class of ''shengyuan'', who were the best performers in the college exam, and got to receive government-issued rations and pay for their academic achievements.  The top performers within this class would get accepted into the [[Guozijian|Imperial Academy]] as '''gongsheng''' ([[wikt:貢生|貢生]], lit. "tribute student"), who will then be eligible to sit the provincial or even the national exam directly.
*** '''''Anshou''''' ([[wikt:案首|案首]], lit. "first on the desk"), the highest ranking ''linsheng'', and thus the top ''shengyuan'' who ranked first in college exam.
** '''''Zengsheng''''' ([[wikt:增生|增生]], lit. "expanded student"), the second class of ''shengyuan'', who performed less well than ''linsheng'' and enjoyed similar legal perks, but not the material allowance.
** '''''Fusheng''''' ([[wikt:附生|附生]], lit. "attached student"), the third class of ''shengyuan'' and considered substitute recruits outside the official quota of enrollment.  They were considered passable in exams but needed more improvements.
* {{anchor|juren}} '''''[[Juren]]''''' ([[wikt:舉人|舉人]], lit. "recommended man"), a qualified graduate who passed the triennial provincial exam.
** '''''Jieyuan''''' ([[wikt:解元|解元]], lit. "top escorted examinee"), the ''juren'' who ranked first in provincial exam.
* '''''Gongshi''''' ([[wikt:貢士|貢士]], lit. "tribute scholar"), a recognized scholarly achiever who passed the triennial national exam.
** '''''Huiyuan''''' ([[wikt:會元|會元]], lit. "top conference examinee"), the ''gongshi'' who ranked first in national exam.
* '''''[[Jinshi]]''''' ([[wikt:進士|進士]], lit. "advanced scholar"), a graduate who passed the triennial court exam.
** '''''Jinshi Jidi''''' ([[wikt:進士及第|進士及第]], lit. "distinguished ''jinshi''"), graduates ranked first class in the court exam, usually only the top three individuals were qualified for this title.
*** '''''[[Zhuangyuan]]''''' ([[wikt:狀元|狀元]], lit. "top thesis author"), the ''jinshi'' who ranked first overall nationwide.
*** '''''Bangyan''''' ([[wikt:榜眼|榜眼]], lit. "eyes positioned alongside"), the ''jinshi'' who ranked second overall just below ''zhuangyuan''.
*** '''''Tanhua''''' ([[wikt:探花|探花]], lit. "flower snatcher"), the ''jinshi'' ranked third overall.
** '''''Jinshi Chushen''''' ([[wikt:進士出身|進士出身]], lit. "''jinshi'' background"), the graduates who ranked second class in court exam, ranking immediately after the ''tanhua''.
** '''''Tong Jinshi Chushen''''' ([[wikt:同進士出身|同進士出身]], lit. "along with ''jinshi'' background"), graduates ranked third class in the court exam.

===Degree examinations===
Besides the regular tests for the ''jinshi'' and other degrees, there were also occasionally special purpose examinations, by imperial decree (''zhiju''). These decree examinations were for the purpose of particular promotions or to identify talented men for dealing with certain, specific, especially difficult assignments. During the Song dynasty, in 1061, [[Emperor Renzong of Song]] decreed special examinations for the purpose of finding men capable of "direct speech and full remonstrance" (''zhiyan jijian''): the testing procedure required the examinees to submit 50 previously prepared essays, 25 on particular contemporary problems, 25 on more general historical governmental themes. In the examination room, the examinees then had a day to write essays on six topics chosen by the test officials, and finally were required to write a 3,000 character essay on a complex policy problem, personally chosen by the emperor, Renzong. Among the few successful candidates were the Su brothers, [[Su Shi]] and [[Su Zhe]] (who had already attained their ''jinshi'' degrees, in 1057), with Su Shi scoring exceptionally high in the examinations, and subsequently having copies of his examination essays widely circulated.&lt;ref&gt;Murck, 2000: page 31&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of Wu Zetian the imperial government created specialized military examinations for the selection of army officers as a response to the breakdown of garrison militias known as the [[Fubing system]].&lt;ref&gt;Etienne Zi. ''Pratique Des Examens Militaires En Chine.'' (Shanghai, Varietes Sinologiques. No. 9,  1896). [https://archive.org/details/pratiquedesexam00zigoog American Libraries Internet Archive Google Book (Searchable)].&lt;/ref&gt; The first formal military examinations were introduced in 702. Before the military exams, the participants who were from military families studied at military schools.&lt;ref name="Forges2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger V. Des Forges|title=Cultural Centrality and Political Change in Chinese History: Northeast Henan in the Fall of the Ming|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YE6Va-Fe1coC&amp;pg=PA152#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4044-9|pages=152–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful candidates were awarded military versions of Jinshi and Juren degrees: ''Wujinshi'' (武進士) and ''Wujuren'' (武舉人), and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Etienne Zi.

The names of civil ''jinshi'' were carved in marble whereas military ''jinshi'' were not. Nevertheless, the civil and military elements of government were in Chinese political theory sometimes compared to the two wheels of a [[Chinese chariot|chariot]]; if either were neglected, government would not run smoothly.&lt;ref&gt;Miyazaki, ''China's Examination Hell'' p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the military examinations had the same general arrangement as the regular exams, with provincial, metropolitan and palace versions of the exams. The ideal candidate was expected to master the same Confucian texts as the civilians, in addition to martial skills such as archery and horsemanship as well as [[Chinese military texts]], especially [[Sun Tzu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F3baSe8QlPUC&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=military+examination+administered+scholar+gunpowder#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Military culture in imperial China|author=Nicola Di Cosmo|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=|page=245|isbn=0-674-03109-1|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the entry level exam, for instance, which was conducted by the [[County magistrate (China)|district magistrate]], the candidate had to shoot three arrows while riding his horse toward the target, which was the shape of a person. A perfect score was three hits, a good score two, and one hit earned a pass. The candidate failed if he made no hits or fell from his horse. The higher levels were made up of more and more challenging exams until the highest level, conducted at the palace in the presence of the emperor, which included not only mounted archery, but bow bending, halberd brandishing, and weight lifting.&lt;ref&gt;Miyazaki, ''China's Examination Hell'' p. 102, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JR.1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederic Wakeman, Jr.|title=The Great Enterprise: The Manchu Reconstruction of Imperial Order in Seventeenth-century China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nXLwSG2O8AC&amp;pg=PA1041#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1985|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04804-1|pages=1041–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite the intention of raising more military officers through these examinations, rarely did famous generals and strategists ever arise from military degree holders. With some exceptions such as the Tang general [[Guo Ziyi]], the father of the founder of the Song dynasty [[Zhao Hongyin]], Ming generals [[Yu Dayou]] and [[Qi Jiguang]], and Qing general [[Wu Sangui]], graduates of the official military examinations have left few traces. Even in desperate times, the majority of distinguished military figures in Chinese history have come from civil degree holders. In total, 282 military metropolitan exams were held between their inception in 702 and abolishment in 1901. The practices of the Qing and Ming military exams was incorporated into physical education during the Republic of China.&lt;ref name="Morris2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew D.

Besides China, the military examinations were also a practice of certain Korean and Vietnamese dynasties.

===Examination procedures===
[[Image:Exam cells-large.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Examination hall with 7500 cells, [[Guangdong|Canton]], 1873.]]
By 1370, the examinations lasted between 24 and 72 hours, and were conducted in spare, isolated examination rooms; sometimes, however, it was held within cubicles. The small rooms featured two boards which could be placed together to form a bed or placed on different levels to serve as a desk and chair. In order to obtain objectivity in evaluation, candidates were identified by number rather than name, and examination answers were recopied by a third party before being evaluated to prevent the candidate's handwriting from being recognized.

In the main hall of the imperial palace during the Tang and Song Dynasties there stood two stone statues. One was of a [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] and the other of [[Ao (turtle)|Ao]] (鳌), the mythical turtle whose chopped-off legs serve as pillars for the sky in Chinese legend. The statues were erected on stone plinths in the center of a flight of stairs where successful candidates (jinshi) in the palace examination lined up to await the reading of their rankings from a scroll known as the [[jinbang]] (金榜). The first ranked scholar received the title of Zhuàngyuán (狀元/状元), and the honor of standing in front of the statue of Ao. This gave rise to the use of the phrases ''"to have stood at Ao's head"'' (占鳌头 [Zhàn ào tóu]), or ''"to have stood alone at Ao's head"'' (独占鳌头 [Dú zhàn ào tóu]) to describe a Zhuàngyuán, and more generally to refer to someone who excels in a certain field.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Restrictions===
Some people were banned from taking the imperial exam, although this varied to some extent over history. Traditionally, Chinese society was divided into officials/nobility and commoners. The commoners were divided by class or status into 4 groups by occupation, ranked in order of prestige: scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'u, 246&lt;/ref&gt; Beneath these in terms of prestige were the so-called "mean" people, with various regional names and attributes; but, boat-people, beggars, sex-workers, entertainers, slaves, and low-level government employees were all people included among the "mean" class: among other forms of discrimination, "mean" people were forbidden to serve as government officials or to take the imperial exam.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'u, 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Susan Naquin |author2=Evelyn Sakakida Rawski |title=Chinese Society in the Eighteenth Century |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cpfgQNWXpyoC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=The+latter+category+included+remnants+of+aboriginal+groups+who+had+survived+Chinese+expansion+and+settlement+and+practitioners+of+occupations+that+included+prostitutes,+musicians,+actors,+and+some+yamen+employees+(gate+keepers#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20latter%20category%20included%20remnants%20of%20aboriginal%20groups%20who%20had%20survived%20Chinese%20expansion%20and%20settlement%20and%20practitioners%20of%20occupations%20that%20included%20prostitutes%2C%20musicians%2C%20actors%2C%20and%20some%20yamen%20employees%20(gate%20keepers&amp;f=false |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2011-10-31 |type= |edition=reprint,  |series= |volume= |date= |year=1989 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Yale University Press |location= |language= |isbn=0-300-04602-2 |page=117 |pages= |at= |chapter= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the case for the caste of "degraded" outcasts in [[Ningbo]] city, where around 3,000 people, said to be [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] descendants, were barred from taking the Imperial Exams, among numerous other restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pk0UAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=min+degraded++class#v=onepage&amp;q=ningpo%20min%20degraded%20%20class%20descendants%20kin&amp;f=false|title=The Middle kingdom: a survey of the ...

Butchers and [[Wu (shaman)|sorcerers]] were also excluded at times.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'u, 247&lt;/ref&gt; Merchants were generally restricted from taking the exams until the Ming and Qing dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'u, 248&lt;/ref&gt; During Sui and Tang artisans were also restricted from official service; during the Song dynasty artisans and merchants were specifically excluded from the ''jinshi'' exam; and, in the Liao dynasty, physicians, diviners, butchers, and merchants were all prohibited from taking the examinations.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'u, 386 note 70, citing ''Liao-shih''.&lt;/ref&gt; At times, quota systems were also used to restrict the number of candidates allowed to take or to pass the imperial civil service examinations, by region or by other criteria.

==Cultural context==
{{Further|Imperial examination in Chinese mythology}}
Chinese traditional religion responded to concerns about the imperial examination system. The examination system was also influential on the contemporary literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, 265–272&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confucian rationalism===
From a certain viewpoint, the examination system represented the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] system in its most rationalist aspect. The test system was designed to achieve a society ruled by men of [[Confucianism#Meritocracy|merit]], as determined by an objective measure of the candidates' knowledge and intelligence. However, in actual operation, the examinations also included various religious, mythical, or irrational beliefs, which made the examination structure more complex than the Confucian ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, 265–266 and Kracke, 251&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fate===
A less scientifically rational idea which had a significant role in the cultural context of the examination system involved traditional beliefs about fate: that cosmic forces predestine certain human affairs, and particularly that individual success or failure was subject to the will of [[Tian|Heaven]], or that the results of taking the tests could be influenced by the intervention of various deities.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, 265–268&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zhong Kui===
[[Zhong Kui]], also known as Chung-kuei, was a deity associated with the examination system. The story is that he was a scholar who took the tests, and, despite his most excellent performance, he was unfairly deprived of the first-place prize by a corrupt system: in response, he killed himself, the act of suicide condemning him to be a [[Ghosts in Chinese culture|ghost]]. Many people afraid of traveling on roads and paths that may be haunted by evil spirits have worshiped Zhong Kui as a protective deity.&lt;ref&gt;Christie, 60 (picture, 58)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Strange Stories from the Examination Halls''===
Also known as ''Kechang Yiwen Lu'', the ''Strange Stories from the Examination Halls'' was a collection of stories popular among Confucian scholars of the Qing dynasty. The theme of many of the stories is that good deeds are rewarded by success in the examination halls, often by Heaven-inspired deities acting on karmic principles; and evil deeds result in failure, often under the influence of the ghosts of victims.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, 266–267&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming taboo===
Some individuals were discriminated against because of their names, due to a [[naming taboo]]. For example, because the Tang dynasty poet [[Li He]]'s father's name sounded like the ''jin'', in ''jinshi'', he was discouraged from taking the tests.&lt;ref&gt;Hinton, 286&lt;/ref&gt; The claim was that if Li He was called a ''jinshi'', it would be against the rule of etiquette that a son not be called by his father's name.

==Influence==
[[File:ThiHuong1888.jpg|thumb|right|Invigilators seated on high chairs at a provincial exam in 1888 in northern Vietnam]]
===Other countries===
====East====
The Chinese imperial examination system had extensive influence throughout East Asia. It was used as a model by both the [[Goryeo]] and [[Joseon]] dynasties in Korea (see ''[[Gwageo]]'') until the country's [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910|annexation by Japan]].  The examination was technically open to all, except [[Nobi]] who were not subject to taxes or army service. 

The Chinese system provided the framework for the [[Confucian examination system in Vietnam]] from the reign of the [[Lý dynasty]] Emperor [[Lý Nhân Tông]] (1075) until that of the [[Nguyễn dynasty]] Emperor [[Khải Định]] (1919). 

Japan also used the system as a model in the [[Heian period]]; however, it affected only the minor nobility and was replaced by the hereditary system during the [[Samurai]] era.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Haifeng, ''Influence of China’s Imperial Examinations on Japan, Korea and Vietnam'' -''Frontiers of History in China'', October 2007, Volume 2, Issue 4, pp 493–512
&lt;/ref&gt;

====West====
The imperial examination system attracted much attention and greatly inspired political theorists in the Western World, and one of the earliest Chinese institutions to receive foreign notice.&lt;ref&gt;Kracke, 251&lt;/ref&gt; It influenced the [[Northcote–Trevelyan Report]] and hence the reform of the [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Civil Service in British India]].&lt;ref&gt;Ssu-yu Teng, "Chinese Influence on the Western Examination System", ''Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies'' 7 (1942–1943):  267–312.&lt;/ref&gt; After Great Britain's successful implementation of systematic, open, and competitive examinations in India in the 19th century, similar systems were instituted in the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|United Kingdom]] itself, and in other Western nations.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 417&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poetry===
Some of the main outstanding questions regarding the imperial examinations are in regard to poetry. To what extent did the inclusion of poetry in the examinations influence the writing of poetry, for instance the proliferation of [[Tang poetry|poetry during the Tang dynasty]]?&lt;ref&gt;Yu, 58–60&lt;/ref&gt; There is a long history of debate on the usefulness of the procedure of testing the ability of the candidates to write poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Murck, 51&lt;/ref&gt; During the Tang dynasty, a poetry section was added to the examinations, requiring the examinee to compose a ''[[shi (poetry)|shi]]'' poem in the five-character, 12-line [[regulated verse]] form and a ''[[Fu (poetry)|fu]]'' composition of 300 to 400 characters&lt;ref&gt;Yu, 58&lt;/ref&gt; The poetry requirement remained standard for many decades, despite some controversy, although briefly abolished for the examination year 833–834 (by order of [[Li Deyu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Yu, 58–59, who notes factual inaccuracy of the former belief that the poetry requirement was eliminated from 781–834&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Song dynasty]], in the late 1060s [[Wang Anshi]] removed the traditional poetry composition sections ([[regulated verse]] and ''[[Fu (poetry)|fu]]''), on the grounds of irrelevancy to the official functions of bureaucratic office: on the other side of the debate, [[Su Shi]] (Dongpo) pointed out that the selection of great ministers of the past had not been obstructed by the poetry requirements, that the study and practice of poetry encouraged careful writing, and that the evaluation and grading of poetry was more objective than for the prose essays, due to the strict and detailed rules for writing verse according to the formal requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Murck, 52&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}
An '''implied-in-fact contract''' is a form of an implied [[contract]] formed by non-verbal conduct, rather than by explicit words. The [[United States Supreme Court]] has defined it as "an agreement 'implied in fact'" as "founded upon a meeting of minds, which, although not embodied in an express contract, is [[Inference|inferred]], as a fact, from conduct of the parties showing, in the light of the surrounding circumstances, their tacit understanding."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co. v. United States|261|592|1923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the parties may not have exchanged words of agreement, their conduct may indicate that an agreement existed.  

For example, if a patient goes to a doctor's appointment, his actions indicate he intends to receive treatment in exchange for paying reasonable/fair doctor's fees. Likewise, by seeing the patient, the doctor's actions indicate he intends to treat the patient in exchange for payment of the bill. Therefore, it seems that a contract actually existed between the doctor and the patient, even though nobody spoke any words of agreement. (They both agreed to the same essential terms, and acted in accordance with that agreement. There was mutuality of [[Consideration under American law|consideration]].) In such a case, the court will probably find that (as a [[Question of fact|matter of fact]]) the parties had an implied contract. If the patient refuses to pay after being examined, he will have [[breach of contract|breached]] the implied contract. Another example of an implied contract is the payment method known as a [[letter of credit]].

Generally, an implied contract has the same legal force as an [[express contract]]. However, it may be more difficult to prove the existence and terms of an implied contract should a dispute arise. In some [[jurisdiction]]s, contracts involving [[real estate]] may not be created on an implied-in-fact basis, requiring the transaction to be in writing.  

[[Unilateral contract]]s are often the subject matter of these types of contracts where acceptance is being made by beginning a specified task.

==Potential conduct implying implied contract==
* A prior history of similar agreements.
* When recipient accepts something of value knowing other party expects payment.

'''Inform Napalm''' is a volunteer initiative to inform Ukrainian citizens and the foreign public about the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|undeclared war against Ukraine]], the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]], and the activities of the Russian special services as well as the militants of the so-called "[[Donetsk People's Republic|DPR]]", "[[Luhansk People's Republic|LPR]]", and "[[Novorossiya (confederation)|Novorossiya]]". The team members are engaged in a wide range of other volunteer activities.  In order to inform the foreign audience, authors translate materials to dozens of languages, including [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].

The Informnapalm.org website was created in early 2014 after the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russian military intervention in Ukraine]] and annexation of Crimea. During the existence of the project, volunteers conducted two profound investigations of the [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17|Boeing-777 crash]] and gathered evidence of the presence of Russian troops in Ukrainian territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.day.kiev.ua/uk/article/media/vvichlyva-zbroya|title=Ввічлива зброя|author=Марія Прокопенко|date=September 11, 2015|publisher=[[День (газета)|День]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Top-10 military gadgets involved in the russian aggression against Ukraine.jpg|thumb|413x413px|TOP-10 Military Gadgets Involved in the Russian Aggression Against Ukraine. InformNapalm Infographics]]
The main activities of the project are collecting and analysing [[Open-source intelligence|OSINT]]-information, found in open sources, including social networks.   InformNapalm's investigation of 53rd Artillery Brigade commander colonel Sergei Muchkayev, suspected of killing the [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17|MH17]] passengers, was used in the report of the [[Eliot Higgins|Bellingcat research team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=MH17 - Potential Suspects and Witnesses from the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/53rd-report-public.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|Russian intervention in Syria]], InformNapalm began publishing personal data of Russian pilots who bombarded Syrian cities, and together with the media project "[[Visuals (project)|Visuals]]" created infographics containing personal data of crew members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://informnapalm.org/ua/syriya-infografika-ofitsery-vks-rf-vijskovi-zlochyntsi-kremlya/|title=Сирія.

'''International labour law''' is the body of rules spanning [[public international law|public]] and [[private international law]] which concern the rights and duties of employees, employers, [[trade union]]s and governments in regulating the workplace. The [[International Labour Organization]] and the [[World Trade Organization]] have been the main international bodies involved in reform labour markets. The [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] have indirectly driven changes in labour policy by demanding [[structural adjustment]] [[Conditionality|conditions]] for receiving loans or grants. [[Conflict of laws]] issues arise, determined by national courts, when people work in more than one country, and supra-national bodies, particularly in the [[EU law|law]] of the [[European Union]], has a growing body of rules regarding labour rights.

'''International labour standards''' refer to conventions agreed upon by international actors, resulting from a series of value judgments, set forth to protect basic worker rights, enhance workers’ job security, and improve their terms of [[employment]] on a global scale. The intent of such standards, then, is to establish a worldwide minimum level of protection from inhumane labour practices through the adoption and implementation of said measures.  From a theoretical standpoint, it has been maintained, on ethical grounds, that there are certain basic [[human rights]] that are universal to humankind.&lt;ref name="Brown1"&gt;Brown, Drusilla K., Alan V. Deardorff and Robert M. Stern. "International Labour Standards and Trade: A Theoretical Analysis", ''Fair trade and harmonisation: Prerequisites for free trade?'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1996. 227–272.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is the aim of international labour standards to ensure the provision of such rights in the [[workplace]], such as against [[workplace aggression]], [[workplace bullying|bullying]], [[employment discrimination|discrimination]] and [[gender inequality]] on the other hands for [[diversity (business)|working diversity]], [[workplace democracy]] and [[empowerment]].

While the existence of international labour standards does not necessarily imply implementation or enforcement mechanisms, most real world cases have utilised formal treaties and agreements stemming from international institutions.&lt;ref name=Berik2006&gt;Berik, Günseli and Yana Rodgers. 2006. "Asia's race to capture post-MFA markets: a snapshot of labour standards, compliance, and impacts on competitiveness", ''Asian Development Review'' 23(1): 55–86.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary international agency charged with developing working standards is the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO). Established in 1919, the ILO advocates international standards as essential for the eradication of labour conditions involving "injustice, hardship and privation". According to the ILO, international labour standards contribute to the possibility of lasting [[peace]], help to mitigate potentially adverse effects of international [[market competition]] and help the progress of [[international development]].

Implementation, however, is not limited to the ILO nor is it constrained to the legislative model that the ILO represents.  Other alternatives include direct trade sanctions, multilateral enforcement, and voluntary standards. In addition to controversies that arise over each of these models, greater issues have also been raised concerning the debate over the need for international labour standards themselves. However, while critics have arisen, the [[international community]] has largely come to a consensus in favour of basic protection of the world’s labour force from inhumane practices.&lt;ref&gt;Maskus, Keith E. [http://elibrary.worldbank.org/content/workingpaper/10.1596/1813-9450-1817 "Should core labour standards be imposed through international trade policy?"] ''The World Bank: The Policy Working Paper Series'' 1 (1999), accessed March 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated with the development of successful international labour standards is proper monitoring and enforcement of labour standards. Most monitoring occurs through the ILO, but domestic agencies and other NGOs also play a role in the successful monitoring of international labour standards.&lt;ref name=ApplyingPromoting /&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of labour law}}
Since the [[industrial revolution]] the labour movement has been concerned how economic [[globalisation]] would weaken the bargaining power of workers, as their employers could move to hire workers abroad without the protection of the labour standards at home. In the Fourth Annual International Congress in 1869, the following was resolved:&lt;ref&gt;K Marx, ''Report of the General Council to the Fourth Annual Congress'' ([http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/iwma/documents/1869/basle-report.htm 1869])&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|the extension of the principle of free trade, which induces between nations such a competition that the interest of the workman is liable to be lost sight of and sacrificed in the fierce international race between capitalists, demands that such [unions] should be still further extended and made international.}}

=== Early history ===
The concept of protecting workers from the perils of labour environments dates all the way back to 14th-century Europe.&lt;ref name="Brown2"&gt;Brown, Drusilla K. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2696558 "Labour standards: Where do they belong on the international trade agenda?"] ''The Journal of Economic Perspectives'' 15, no. 3 (2001): 89-112, accessed March 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The first example of the modern labor rights movement, though, came in response to the brutal working conditions that accompanied the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="Brown2"/&gt;  In 1802, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed what is now known as the [[Factory Acts|English Factory Act]].  The act sought to regulate the workday of apprentices by restricting work hours to 12 per day.&lt;ref name="Brown2"/&gt;  In doing so, the English Factory Act served as a precursor to the models of international labour standards seen today.  Minimal regulations similar to those found in English legislation subsequently became increasingly commonplace among 19th century industrialising nations.  Early attempts at the provision of labour standards were limited in scope, though.  Such conventions focused primarily on improving working conditions in relation to hours of work, women's and [[Child labour|children's labour]], and the use of hazardous materials.&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt; While it was evident that support for workers’ rights was inconsistent across international boundaries, activists originally only employed the use of moral suasion to deal with differences in labour standards.  It was not until the latter parts of the 19th century that efforts were made to implement uniform standards on an international scale.&lt;ref name="Brown2"/&gt;

=== Creation of ILO ===
[[File:Flag of ILO.svg|thumb|Flag of ILO]]
In 1919, following the end of the [[World War I|First World War]], the agenda on international labour standards reached a new level of prominence as a result of the founding of the [[International Labour Organization]].&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt; As mandated by Part XIII of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the ILO was created as a branch of the [[League of Nations]] in order to address all conceivable aspects of labour rights.  Preliminary efforts focused primarily on the eradication of slavery and all forms of forced labour.&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt; The agenda quickly expanded, however, to include the rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining, non-discrimination in employment, and the elimination of child labour. The ILO’s creation marked the first instance of multiple major international actors coming together in an attempt to reach a consensus on universal workers’ rights. Despite a lack of any formal means of coercion, the ILO then urged its 44 original member countries to adopt and ratify conventions limiting oppressive labour market practices.&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt;

=== The early years of the ILO ===
In the first two years of the ILO’s existence, 22 international labour conventions were adopted.&lt;ref name=Origins&gt;{{cite web|title=Origins and History|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/history/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the topics that the first conventions addressed were “hours of work in industry, unemployment, maternity protection, night work for women, minimum age, and night work for young persons in industry.”&lt;ref name=Origins/&gt; In 1930, the ILO adopted the first future fundamental convention: the Forced Labour Convention (No.29), which prohibited all forms of forced labour unless exempted by certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ILO between the two world wars 1930|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/support/lib/century/content/1930.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the [[United States]] joined the ILO in 1934 noting that complex labour issues would require an international response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief History and Timeline|url=http://www.ilo.org/washington/ilo-and-the-united-states/brief-history-and-timeline/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the history of the [[League of Nations]], the ILO is the only League-affiliated organisation that the United States joined. With the backdrop of World War 2, the ILO broadened its mandate with the [[Declaration of Philadelphia]], signed during the 26th general conference session in 1944. The Declaration of Philadelphia, which is attached to the general constitution of the ILO, foreshadows some of the ILO’s earliest future fundamental conventions including the freedom of expression and association which was adopted in 1948 as Convention 87, Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention.&lt;ref name=Philadelphia&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration of Philadelphia|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/libdoc/ilo/1944/44B09_10_e_f.pdf|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C087 - Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_ILO_CODE:C087|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Globalisation and changing divisions of labour ===
In the first half of the 20th century, global [[Division of labour|divisions of labour]] were shaped largely by the practices of [[colonialism]]. Poorer countries exported natural resources to richer countries, which then manufactured and produced specialised goods.&lt;ref name=Kabeer3&gt;Kabeer, Naila. [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all?content=10.1080/1354570042000198227 "Globalisation, labour standards, and women's rights: dilemmas of collective (in)action in an interdependent world"], ''Feminist Economics'' 10, no. 1 (2004): 3-35, accessed March 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As many colonised nations achieved independence, developing nations in the [[North-South divide|global South]] took on increasingly [[Protectionism|protectionist policies]] in attempts to build up the manufacturing sectors of their economies, thus marking a shift in the global division of labour. However, towards the latter part of the 20th century, a number of factors saw protectionist measures fall. Such factors included rising labour costs in the north, advances in transportation and communication technologies, the liberalisation of trade, and the deregulation of markets.&lt;ref name=Kabeer3/&gt; In the midst of a changing international labour landscape, developing nations in the south took on a previously unseen domination of the labour-intensive manufacturing industry.

With the deregulation of major markets and significant increases in the volume of international trade, attempts to make manufacturing sectors more attractive to retailers saw extreme downward pressure placed on the quality of working conditions in lower income regions of the world.&lt;ref name="Kabeer3" /&gt; This gave rise to growing concerns about a global [[Race to the bottom]], in which governments take part in the iterative loosening of labour protections in attempts to aid the international competitiveness of export-oriented industries. Fears of this nature consequently produced the notable increases in the discourse on international labour ethics that characterise the contemporary [[international human rights law|international human rights]] arena.&lt;ref name="Brown2" /&gt;

== Models ==
The traditional model of labour standards regulation has been, for most of history, within-country or within-jurisdiction legislation and enforcement.&lt;ref name=Block258&gt;Block, Richard N., Karen Roberts, Cynthia Ozeki and Myron J. Roomkin. "Models of international labour standards", ''Industrial Relations'' 40, no. 2 (2001): 258–292.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this model may not be appropriate when competitors in a product market are located in different countries or jurisdictions with dissimilar labour standards. This concern opens up the discussion for the establishment of international labour standards, which, in turn, require international regulation, particularly in the context of global trade. However, determining an effective method of implementation of international labor standards has been an area of difficulty and an area that is highly contested. The following sections outline several existing models for the regulation of international labour standards based largely on work by Richard N. Block, Karen Roberts, Cynthia Ozeki and Myron J. Roomkin in their paper titled "Models of International Labour Standards".&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt;

=== Legislative ===
The legislative model for implementing a set of international labour standards is the best known.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; This model involves the enactment and enforcement of labour standards by a legislative body across a union of countries.  Social policies regarding employment and labour typically fall into three areas: free movement of labour, prevention of [[social dumping]] via low labour standards, and dialogue between labour and management.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; This model has been adopted by the [[European Community]], part of the [[European Union]], and is also the model taken by the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO). Organisations, such as these, are given the authority, through a series of procedures, to then issue directives in any of these areas of labour policy. Member states must comply with these directives; however, what compliance actually means and entails is left to the discretion of each member state.

=== Direct trade sanctions ===
For over 25 years, there have been links between labour standards and [[international trade]], particularly for specific commodities.&lt;ref name=Berik56/&gt; The earliest and broadest-based example of linking international labour standards with trade is found in U.S. legislation under the [[Trade Act of 1974]], creating the [[Generalized System of Preferences]] (GSP). Under the GSP, the United States was allowed to grant nonreciprocal [[tariff]] preference to less developed countries, based on certain country and product eligibility criteria, in order to promote their economic growth and development. Among the country eligibility criteria is affording workers in a country certain internationally recognized rights, similar to the four core conventions established by the ILO.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. International Trade Commission. 1997. Advice on Providing Additional GSP Benefits for Least Developed Countries. Investigation No. 332-370, Publication 3023, February. At http://www.usitc.go:80/wais/reports/arc/W3023.HTM{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a complaint or petition was filed against a GSP beneficiary, these are processed through the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]]. Since 1988, eight countries have been suspended or terminated from the GSP program: Burma, Liberia, Maldives, Mauritania, Nicaragua, Pakistan (several products), Sudan and Syria.&lt;ref name=Suspended&gt;"Countries Suspended from the GSP Program for Failure to Enforce Internationally Recognised Worker Rights", 1998, Correspondence with Jon Rosenbaum of the Office of the United States Trade Representative.&lt;/ref&gt; Four countries have been suspended but subsequently reinstated: Central African Republic, Chile, Paraguay, and Romania.&lt;ref name=Suspended/&gt; Additionally, Section 2202 of the [[Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988]] requires that the [[Secretary of State]] submit to Congress an annual report on the economic policy and trade practices of each country with which the United States has an economic or trade relationship.

The trade sanctions model in the United States, also working as an incentives approach of sorts, appears to have been successful in forcing U.S. officials to encourage countries that are the subject of complaints to address severe violations of labour standards, as defined in the legislation. This model, however, is not designed to be a broad-based guarantee of labour standards among trading partners because it is based on external complaints not the results of monitoring.&lt;ref name=Berik56/&gt; While it is effective in providing procedural rights, a lower percentage of trading partners provide substantive standards, so this measure has had mixed success. Some hope that implementation in competitor developing countries along with support by complementary domestic policies would allow this model to overall, raise the global [[social floor]].&lt;ref name=Berik56/&gt;

=== Multilateral enforcement ===
Another example of the various methods of implementation of international labour standards is the multilateral enforcement model. The model, embodied in the [[North American Free Trade Agreement|North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation]] (NAALC), is different from other compulsory methods in that it opposes any imposition of common standards schemes.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; Instead, the multilateral enforcement model requires that signatories to agreements like the NAALC make firm commitments to existing labor standard structures within their respective domestic spheres.  The unique aspect of the NAALC, however, is that it does not in any way dictate policy.  This includes a strong aversion to uniformly adopted standards on the international level.  Rather than encouraging the inclusion of a baseline set of workers’ rights, the multilateral enforcement model merely requires that its members strive to create unbiased administrative bodies that judge whether or not appropriate measures are being taken to ensure the continued support of domestic labour standards.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; In this manner, the multilateral model is not international in its adoption of a common set of principles, but rather in its level of required commitment to an unspecified group of standards.  In enforcing such commitments, agreements like the NAALC primarily utilize recommendations and publicity to make decision makers accountable for their actions.  Multilateral enforcement models like the NAALC have experienced mixed results in terms of effectiveness due to their limited powers of influence.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt;

=== Voluntary standards ===
The voluntary standards model makes reference to a system of implementation for labour standards based on a corporate [[code of conduct]]. Corporate codes of conduct are adopted when various organizations join together in agreement to operate under a set of socially responsible labour rules. Therefore, this model generally involves voluntary behaviour and self-regulation. An example of voluntary corporate adoption of labour standards is given by the [[Sullivan Principles]] in [[South Africa]] that were taken on by a group of U.S. companies.&lt;ref&gt;Dordrecht, Jan, Karen Paul and Steven D. Lyndenberg. 1992. "Applications of Corporate Social Monitoring Systems", ''Journal of Business Ethics'' 11(1):1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, U.S. apparel retailers, such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], the Gap, and Liz Claiborne, have recently attempted to put in place a system of regulations to prevent their products from being produced under [[sweatshop]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Paula. 1998a. “U.S. Apparel Industry to Monitor World Shops.” Journal of Commerce, October 19, p. 1A.&lt;/ref&gt;

For this model to be successful, there must be incentive for compliance. The problem, however, is that in the case of labour standards, there are usually high economic incentives to disregard these standards, which are viewed as rises in production costs. For this reason, the monitoring system plays a crucial role in the success and effectiveness of such conditions. In some cases, like the aforementioned [[Sullivan Principles]] in South Africa, monitoring has demonstrated the codes’ success. In this case, investors rewarded adherence to the code, as a sign of [[corporate citizenship]]. On the other hand, consumers can also punish firms they see as socially irresponsible by means of [[boycott]]s or the individual decision to avoid purchase of certain products.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Richard B. 1994. “A Hard-Headed Look at Labour Standards.” In International Labour Standards and Economic Interdependence, edited by Werner Sengenberger and Duncan Campbell, pp. 79-91. Geneva: ILO&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The main point of these examples being: where there is strong pressure from investors and consumers to support certain standards, companies may benefit by being seen as upholding accepted morals.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt;

Now, while this is true, it is also true that where costs of complying with stringent standards are high and the sources of consumer pressure diffused, codes are likely to be ineffective.  It takes the active involvement and interest of the company, in response to whatever actions have been taken, for this model to be successful. When they choose to respond to outside pressures, companies use means such as public announcements, local religious leaders, human rights activists, university professors, and labor representatives, among others, to implement compliance and a system of monitoring. Another difficulty has been that, while pressure has been effectively pressed on individual firms, it has been difficult to find agreement at an industry level, in terms of corporate codes.

Finally, a variation of the voluntary standards models is one of certification, which began in October 1997 with the issuance of [[SA8000|SA (Social Accountability) 8000]] by the Council on Economic Priorities Accrediting Agency (CEPAA). [[SA8000]] is an example of a corporate certification process for social responsibility and labor standards.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; This certification process has the purpose of identifying corporations that comply with certain criteria based on social accountability requirements, including criteria for [[child labor]] and worker health and safety. The resulting certification then serves the purpose of assuring customers that goods and services provided by certified firms have been produced by workers who are offered labour standards that meet at least a minimally acceptable level.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt;

==International Labour Organization==
{{Clist global labour}}
{{main|International Labour Organization|List of ILO Conventions}}
The [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) is a specialised agency of the [[United Nations]], consisting of 187 member countries, that deals with labour issues. Following [[World War I]], the [[Treaty of Versailles]] contained the first constitution of a new [[International Labour Organization]] founded on the principle that "labour is not a commodity", and for the reason that "peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Treaty of Versailles]] 1919, [[s:Constitution of the International Labour Office|Part XIII]], Section I and art 427&lt;/ref&gt; The primary role of the [[ILO]] has been to coordinate principles of international labour law by issuing Conventions, which codify labour laws on all matters. Members of the ILO can voluntarily adopt and ratify the conventions by enacting the rules in their domestic law. For instance, the first [[Hours of Work (Industry) Convention, 1919]] requires a maximum of a 48-hour week, and has been ratified by 52 out of 185 member states. The UK ultimately refused to ratify the Convention, as did many current EU members states, although the [[Working Time Directive]] adopts its principles, subject to the individual opt-out.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, KD Ewing, ''Britain and the ILO'' (2nd edn IER 1994) 16. Two further general working time conventions are the [[Forty-Hour Week Convention, 1935]] No 51 and the [[Holidays with Pay Convention, 1936]] No 52&lt;/ref&gt; The present constitution of the ILO comes from the [[Declaration of Philadelphia]] 1944, and under the [[Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work]] 1998 classified eight conventions&lt;ref&gt;There are 189 Conventions, however some have been superseded by others. For instance, Conventions Nos 2, 34, 96 and 181 all concern [[private employment agencies]], but only Convention 181 is in force.&lt;/ref&gt; as core. Together these require freedom to join a union, bargain collectively and take action (Conventions Nos [[Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention|87]] and [[Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention|98]]) abolition of forced labour ([[Forced Labour Convention|29]] and [[Abolition of Forced Labour Convention|105]]) abolition labour by children before the end of compulsory school ([[Minimum Age Convention, 1973|138]] and [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention|182]]) and no discrimination at work (Nos [[Equal Remuneration Convention|100]] and [[Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention|111]]). Compliance with the core Conventions is obligatory from the fact of membership, even if the country has not ratified the Convention in question. To ensure compliance, the ILO is limited to gathering evidence and reporting on member states' progress, so that publicity will put public and international pressure to reform the laws. Global reports on core standards are produced yearly, while individual reports on countries who have ratified other Conventions are compiled on a bi-annual or perhaps less frequent basis.

The ILO, by its existence, is the recognised international vehicle for raising international labour standards issues in a worldwide forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/public/english/standards/relm/country.htm "Alphabetical list of ILO member countries"], ''International Labour Organization'', accessed April 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; No other model in existence is capable of performing this role. This organisation establishes labour standards by means of both conventions and recommendations and has a tripartite governing structure – representing government, employers and workers.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; While ILO recommendations take more of the role of providing mere guidance to member states, the stronger form, ILO conventions, have the status of a [[treaty]], which, in principle, is binding on the member countries that voluntarily ratify them. These represent benchmarks of strong labour standards towards which countries can strive by promulgating and enforcing national laws that comply with the conventions.&lt;ref name=Berik56&gt;Berik, Günseli and Yana Van der Meulen Rodgers. "Options for enforcing labour standards: Lessons from Bangladesh and Cambodia", ''Journal of International Development'' 22 (2008): 56-85, www.interscience.wiley.com, accessed March 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is through these means that the organisation works to enforce international labour standards.

In 1998, the ILO [[International Labour Conference]] adopted the “Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work” defining certain rights as “fundamental.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/declaration/lang--en/index.htm "Declaration: Home page"],  International Labour Organization, accessed April 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration commits member states to respect and promote these main principles, referred to as the core conventions, which are grouped into the following four categories (total of eight ILO conventions): freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to [[collective bargaining]], the elimination of forced or compulsory labour, the abolition of [[child labour]], and the elimination of [[discrimination]] in respect of employment and occupation. The Declaration claims these rights to be universal, applying to all people in all States – regardless of level of economic development.&lt;ref name=Berik56/&gt; The International Labour Conference regards these principles as so important that all member counties are obligated to comply with them, regardless of ratification status.

Alongside the fundamental conventions, the ILO has also identified four priority conventions or governance conventions. Crucial to the running of the international labour standards systems implemented by the ILO, the ILO recommends that member states ratify the following priority conventions: the Labour Inspection Convention (1947), the Labour Inspection (Agriculture) Convention (1969), the Triparte Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention (1976), and the Employment Policy Convention (1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conventions and Recommendations|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/introduction-to-international-labour-standards/conventions-and-recommendations/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues with the ILO’s approach to implementing international labour standards come down to a question of universality amongst the conventions and member countries, with some arguing that flexibility is necessary to meet the needs of developing countries. These concerns gather around the idea that the race to expand exports or attract foreign investment can cause competition on the basis of labour costs, leading to a decline in international labour standards as governments either dismantle national laws that protect workers or weaken the enforcement of these laws.&lt;ref name=Berik56/&gt; The underlying issue here is the connection between national incomes and the standards a country can feasibly support while remaining competitive. Other issues involve enforcement of these standards following ratification. The ILO provides a vehicle for investigating cases of noncompliance through representations, filed by employer or worker organisations, or complaints, lodged by another member that also ratified the convention.&lt;ref name=Berik56/&gt; These are then sent to a committee that launches an investigation and report. This is followed by either acceptance of recommendations on steps the government may take to address the complaint or the request to submit the case to the [[International Court of Justice]]. Failure to comply may result in an incurred sanction from the organization. [[File:Peace Palace covered by the first flakes of snow of 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Peace Palace]], the headquarters for the International Court of Justice]]

Overall, the ILO structure essentially created a system of [[voluntary compliance]] with labor standards based on ratification of the established conventions.  In general the enforcement system of representation and complaints has been successful – success being measured by the fact that only one representation or complaint has reached the most severe sanction.&lt;ref name=Berik56/&gt; On the other hand, due to the absence of strong sanctions, the ILO lacks a strong enough deterrent factor for countries inclined to violate the standards the ILO upholds. Further, the “flexibility” of standards allows too much leeway for adaptation based on independent circumstances, diminishing the force of the conventions.

==World Trade Organization==
{{main|Labour standards in the World Trade Organization}}
[[File:Wto logo.svg|thumb|left|As one of the only [[international organisations]] with real enforcement power through trade sanctions, the [[WTO]] has been the target for calls by labour lawyers to incorporate global standards of the [[International Labour Organization]].]]
Because the ILOs enforcement and sanction mechanisms are weak, there has been significant discussion about incorporating [[labour standards in the World Trade Organization]]'s operation, since its formation in 1994. The [[WTO]] oversees, primarily, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] which is a treaty aimed at reducing customs, tariffs and other barriers to free import and export of goods, services and capital between its 157-member countries. Unlike for the ILO, if the WTO rules on trade are contravened, member states who secure a judgment by the [[Dispute settlement in the World Trade Organization|Dispute Settlement procedures]] (effective a judicial process) may retaliate through trade sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Hughes and Rorden Wilkinson (1998), "International Labour Standards and World Trade: No Role for the World Trade Organization?", New Political Economy, 3: 3, pp. 375-389&lt;/ref&gt; This could include reimposition of targeted tariffs against the non-compliant country. Proponents of an integrated approach have called for a "[[social clause]]" to be inserted into the GATT agreements, for example by amending article XX, which gives an exception to the general trade barrier reduction rules allowing imposition of sanctions for breaches of human rights. An explicit reference to core labour standards could allow action where a WTO member state is found to be in breach of ILO standards. Opponents argue that such an approach could backfire and undermine labour rights, as a country's industries, and therefore its workforce, are necessarily harmed but without any guarantee that labour reform would take place. Furthermore, it was argued in the Singapore Ministerial Declaration 1996 that "the [[comparative advantage]] of countries, particularly low-age developing countries, must in no way be put into question."&lt;ref&gt;Singapore Ministerial Declaration ([http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/min96_e/wtodec_e.htm 13 December 1996])&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, it is argued that countries ought to be able to take advantage of low wages and poor conditions at work as a comparative advantage in order to boost their exports. Similarly it is disputed that business will relocate production to low wage countries from higher wage countries such as the UK, because that choice depends mostly on [[productivity]] of workers. The view of many labour lawyers and economists remains that more trade, in the context of weaker bargaining power and mobility for workers, still allows for business to opportunistically take advantage of workers by moving production, and that a coordinated multilateral approach with targeted measures against specific exports is preferable.&lt;ref&gt;See KA Elliott and [[RB Freeman]], ''Can Labor Standards Improve under Globalization?'' (Institute for International Economics 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; While the WTO has yet to incorporate labour rights into its procedures for dispute settlements, many countries began to make bilateral agreements that protected core labour standards instead.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (14 May 2011) OJ 2011 L127, article 13&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in domestic tariff regulations not yet touched by the WTO agreements, countries have given preference to other countries who do respect core labour rights, for example under the EU Tariff Preference Regulation, articles 7 and 8.&lt;ref&gt;Tariff Preference Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 arts 7, 8, 15 and Annex II and III&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workers in multiple countries==
{{main|Conflict of laws}}
While the debate over labour standards applied by the ILO and the WTO seeks to balance standards with free movement of capital globally, [[conflicts of laws]] (or [[private international law]]) issues arise where workers move from home to go abroad. If a worker from America performs part of her job in Brazil, China and Denmark (a "peripatetic" worker) or if a worker is engaged in Ecuador to work as an expatriate abroad in France, an employer may seek to characterise the contract of employment as being governed by the law of the country where labour rights are least favourable to the worker, or seek to argue that the most favourable system of labour rights does not apply. For example, in a [[UK labour law]] case, ''[[Ravat v Halliburton Manufacturing and Services Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2012] UKSC 1&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Ravat was from the UK but was employed in Libya by a German company that was part of the American multinational oil conglomerate, [[Halliburton]]. He was dismissed by a supervisor based in [[Egypt]]. He was told he would be hired under UK law terms and conditions, and this was arranged by a staffing department in Aberdeen. Under the UK [[Employment Rights Act 1996]] he would have a right to unfair dismissal, but the Act left open what the territorial scope of the statute was. The UK Supreme Court held that the principle would be that for an expatriate worker, although the general rule is that they will not have UK labour law rights, there would be an exception if the worker could show a "close connection" to the UK, and this was established through the contractual assurances given to Mr Rabat.&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Lawson v Serco Ltd]]'' [2006] UKHL 3 and ''[[Duncombe v Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families]]'' [2011] UKSC 36&lt;/ref&gt;

This fits within the general framework in the EU. Under the EU [[Rome I Regulation]] article 8,&lt;ref&gt;Rome I Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 593/2008&lt;/ref&gt; workers will have employment rights of the country where they habitually work. But exceptionally they may have a claim in another country if they can establish a close connection to it. The Regulation emphasises that the rules should be applied with the purpose of protecting the worker.&lt;ref&gt;See Rome I, recital 23 and Brussels I, recital 13&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also necessary that a court has jurisdiction to hear a claim. Under the [[Brussels I Regulation]] article 19,&lt;ref&gt;Brussels I Regulation (EC) No 44/2001&lt;/ref&gt; this requires the worker habitually works in the place where the claim is brought, or is engaged there.

==European Union law==
{{main|EU law|European labour law|Directive on services in the internal market}}
The [[European Community]] (EC) is a multigovernmental legislative structure that, through the [[Treaty of European Union]] (Maastricht) in 1992, the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] in 1997, and various other agreements has promoted full economic integration of its member states.&lt;ref name=Springer1994&gt;Springer, Beverly. 1994. ''The European Union and Its Citizens: The Social Agenda'', Westport, CT: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While it has issued a number of directives in non-labour areas, the same cannot be said for matters concerning social policy and labour. However, some restrictions regarding health and safety have been adopted by the EC in an attempt to mitigate any inhumane practices, involving low health and safety standards, used for the sake of a [[competitive advantage]].&lt;ref name=Springer1994/&gt;

The European Union, unlike most international organisations, has an extensive system of labour laws, but officially excluding (according to the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]) matters around direct wage regulation (e.g. setting a minimum wage), fairness of dismissals (e.g. a requirement for elected workers to approve dismissals) and collective bargaining. A series of Directives regulate almost all other issues, for instance the [[Working Time Directive]] guarantees 28 days of paid holiday, the [[Equality Framework Directive]] prohibits all forms of discrimination for people performing work, and the [[Collective Redundancies Directive]] requires that proper notice is given and consultation takes place before any decisions about economic dismissals are finalised.

However, the [[European Court of Justice]] has recently expanded upon the Treaties through its case law. As well as having legal protection for workers rights, an objective of trade unions has been to organise their members across borders in the same way that [[multinational corporations]] have organised their production globally. In order to meet the balance of power that comes from ability of businesses to dismiss workers or relocate, unions have sought to take collective action and strikes internationally. However, this kind of coordination was recently challenged in the [[European Union]] in two controversial decisions. In ''[[Laval Ltd v Swedish Builders Union]]''&lt;ref&gt;(2008) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62005J0341:EN:HTML C-319/05]&lt;/ref&gt; a group of Latvian workers were sent to a construction site in Sweden on low pay. The local Swedish Union took industrial action to make Laval Ltd sign up to the local collective agreement. Under the [[Posted Workers Directive]], article 3 lays down minimum standards for workers being posted away from home so that workers always receive at least the minimum rights that they would have at home in case their place of work has lower minimum rights. Article 3(7) goes on to say that this "shall not prevent application of terms and conditions of employment which are more favourable to workers". Most people thought this meant that more favourable conditions could be given than the minimum (e.g. in Latvian law) by the host state's legislation or a collective agreement. However, in an interpretation seen as astonishing by many, the ECJ said that only the posting state could raise standards beyond its minimum for posted workers, and any attempt by the host state, or a collective agreement (unless the collective agreement is declared universal under article 3(8)) would be an infringement of the business' freedom to provide services under [[TFEU]] article 56. This decision was implicitly reversed by the European Union legislature in the [[Rome I Regulation]], which makes clear in recital 34 that the host state may allow more favourable standards. However, in ''[[The Rosella]]'', the ECJ also held that a blockade by the [[International Transport Workers Federation]] against a business that was using an [[Estonia]]n [[flag of convenience]] (i.e. saying it was operating under Estonian law to avoid labour standards of Finland) infringed the business' right of free establishment under [[TFEU]] article 49. The ECJ said that it recognised the workers' "right to strike" in accordance with ILO Convention 87, but said that its use must be proportionately to the right of the business' establishment. The result is that the European Court of Justice's recent decisions create a significant imbalance between the international freedom of business, and that of labour, to bargain and take action to defend their interests.

For those members within the EC who favour the implementation of labour standards, there has been a push to ease the decision-making barriers to social legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Liebfried, Stephan and Paul Pierson (eds.). 1995. "Semisovereign Welfare States: Social Policy in a Multitiered Europe", ''European Social Policy: Between Fragmentation and Integration'', pp. 43-77. Washington: The Brookings Institution.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 February, 1992, the signing of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] made it easier to pass legislation on less controversial issues, such as health and safety, nondiscrimination, and consultation with workers.&lt;ref&gt;European Union. 1998a. “Glossary: The Reform of the European Union.” At European Union Internet resources: {{cite web |url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/GSSI/eu.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030402125359/http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/GSSI/eu.html |archivedate=2003-04-02 |df= }} linked to http://europa.eu.int/en/agenda/igc-home/en/g4000s.htm#s1 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990208203802/http://europa.eu.int/en/agenda/igc-home/en/g4000s.htm#s1#s1 |date=1999-02-08 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the EC provides a structure for enacting legislation that applies across counties, the extent to which it can actually create international labour standards, even within its own confines, is limited.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; While these directives allow for labour concerns to be brought above the national level, the presence of philosophical differences among member states as well as constraints on state autonomy demonstrate barriers to this model. However, despite these difficulties and a complex decision-making structure designed to include consultation with the governments of all member states, the various EC policy-making institutions and the related parties have succeeded in creating cross-national legislation for labour standards under its social policy umbrella.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt; Consequently, this model, as demonstrated by the EC, is a viable one for establishing labour standards on a cross-national basis. The difficulty lies in the duplication of this model elsewhere, due to the EC’s unique, integrated community that is the only such general multinational standard system in the world today.&lt;ref name=Block258/&gt;

== Monitoring ==
A crucial element to the success of international labour standards is proper monitoring and enforcement. When monitoring international labor standards, agencies rely on three major types of information: information from international organisations, like the ILO, information from national agencies, and information from non-governmental organizations.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress&gt;{{cite book|author=Committee on Monitoring International Labour Standards, Center for Education, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, and Policy and Global Affairs|title=Monitoring international labor standards techniques and sources of information|year=2004|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, DC|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon locating and determining the necessary data, monitoring agencies then need to process and sift through the results to analyze compliance with certain international labor standards. Finally after compliance analysis, recommendations and required adjustments are then communicated to the concerned party.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress/&gt;

=== Data sources ===
One of the major sources of data necessary for the monitoring of international labour standards is the International Labour Organization. According to Article 22 of the ILO Constitution, “each of the members agrees to make an annual report to the International Labour Office on the measures which it has taken to give effect to the provisions of Conventions to which it is a party.”&lt;ref name=Constitution&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of the International Labour Organization|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/leg/download/constitution.pdf|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, countries are mandated to prepare a report every two years for the Core Labour Standards of the ILO and every five years for all other active conventions that the country has ratified, which are submitted, to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards.&lt;ref name=ExpCommittee&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/applying-and-promoting-international-labour-standards/committee-of-experts-on-the-application-of-conventions-and-recommendations/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For conventions that have not yet been ratified by the country, Article 19 of the ILO Constitution mandates countries to demonstrate on regular intervals steps “they have taken to give effect to any provision of certain conventions or recommendations, and to indicate any obstacles which have prevented or delayed the ratification of a particular convention.”&lt;ref name=Constitution/&gt; All of the above combine to form the ILO’s regular system of supervision.&lt;ref name=ApplyingPromoting&gt;{{cite web|title=Applying and promoting International Labour Standards|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/applying-and-promoting-international-labour-standards/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Surveys|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/applying-and-promoting-international-labour-standards/general-surveys/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|Flag of the United Nations]]
The ILO also has a special procedures type of supervisory mechanism where complaints levelled against member states and freedom of association complaints are dealt with.&lt;ref name=ApplyingPromoting/&gt; Under articles 24 and 26 of the ILO Constitution, different groups of people may indicate to the governing body that a certain state is not complying with an international labor standard that they have previously ratified.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress/&gt;&lt;ref name=Constitution/&gt; Within the ILO framework, the labor standard regarding the freedom to associate has also received a special priority which allows complaints to be brought up to the governing body even if the state has not ratified the conventions regarding the freedom of association.&lt;ref name=ApplyingPromoting/&gt;

Other international organisations like the [[United Nations]] and the [[World Bank]] also monitor international labour standards.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress/&gt; The United Nations largely relies on self-reported data from member states. These data points are used to determine whether or not member states are meeting the requirements of international treaties agreed to by the United Nations. Given that the ILO is a subset of the UN, generally, more detailed labour standards data and compliance records are located within the realm of the ILO.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress/&gt; The World Bank incorporates the international standards set by the ILO as one of the factors behind assistance to member states.

National agencies and NGOs also monitor international labour standards. National agencies generally report on domestic compliance of international labour standards while NGOs are much more diverse in their scope.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress/&gt;

=== Challenges ===
Several challenges, however, exist in the monitoring of international labour standards. The ILO and other international organisations generally rely on self-reporting data from countries.&lt;ref name=ApplyingPromoting /&gt;&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress /&gt;&lt;ref name=ExpCommittee /&gt; Some analysts have questioned the quality and neutrality of these sources of data. For example, definitions of what constitutes [[unemployment]] vary from country to country making it difficult to compare data and to judge data quality.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress /&gt;  Additionally, despite the large amount of data, there are still gaps in their coverage. Coverage is greatest in the urban environments and the formal sector. Conversely, gaps exist in the coverage of rural environments and informal sectors which can positively skew the labour statistics that countries report.&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Rigby, Crispin |author=Division of Behavioural and Social Sciences and Education, Policy and Global Affairs Division, National Research Council of the National|title=Monitoring international labour standards international perspectives : summary of regional forums|year=2004|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-309-52986-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Challenges also exist in the usage of data to assess compliance with various international labour standards. As interest continues to grow in the monitoring and enforcement of international labour standards, an assessment, according to the National Research Council, “requires careful analysis of what the core labor standards mean and imply, how to determine when a country is or is not in compliance, what indicators of compliance and which sources of information to use, and limitations of the sources of information.”&lt;ref name=NationalAcademiesPress /&gt;  Standardisation will be necessary to allow proper and effective monitoring of labor standards.

== Violations ==
=== Workplace discrimination ===
{{See also|Employment Discrimination}}
Workplace discrimination, overt and covert, is an example of violations of international labour standards.  The ILO defines workplace discrimination as “treating people differently because of certain characteristics, such as race, colour, or sex, which results in the impairment of equality and of opportunity and treatment.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workplace Discrimination|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/equality-and-discrimination/workplace-discrimination/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020214812/http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/equality-and-discrimination/workplace-discrimination/lang--en/index.htm|archivedate=20 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An overt example of workplace discrimination is unequal pay, especially between men and women. Though recognized as an example of workplace discrimination since 1919, the [[gender pay gap]], often a measurement of unequal pay, is estimated to be 22.9%, which means that for every dollar earned by a man, a woman, in the same position would earn 77.1 cents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equal Pay: An Introductory Guide|url=http://www.ilo.org/ilc/ILCSessions/100thSession/reports/reports-submitted/WCMS_154779/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013|author1=Oelz, Martin  |author2=Olney, Shauna &amp; Tomei, Manuela}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that the ILO proposes that there are many benefits to reducing and eliminating the gender pay gap, at the current, slow rates of gender pay reduction, the ILO estimates that “another 75 years will be needed to bridge this gap.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A New Era of Social Justice|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@ed_norm/@relconf/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_155656.pdf|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Job security]] is another arena where workplace discrimination can be found. In some developing countries, like Bangladesh, job insecurity reflects patriarchal societies that have diminished women’s options. Currently in Bangladesh, of the 1.8 million workers in garment factories, 1.5 million are women. From the perspective of the factory owners, the advantage of hiring woman is the “docility that comes with disadvantage.”&lt;ref name=Kabeer3 /&gt; Women have fewer opportunities than men when it comes to decent, respectable employment. For many of these women, if they were to lose their jobs at the garment factories, they would be forced into poverty or work in the informal sector, like prostitution.&lt;ref name=Kabeer3 /&gt;

Other forms of discrimination, outside of [[gender discrimination]], include discrimination based on race &amp; ethnicity, age, religion, political opinions, social origins, disabilities, sexual orientations, genetics, and lifestyle. The ILO identifies all these forms of discrimination as violations of international labor standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equality at work: The continuing challenge|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---relconf/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_154779.pdf|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child labour ===
{{Main|Child Labour}}
[[File:Minimum age convention.png|thumb|300px|Parties to ILO's 1973 Minimum Age Convention, and the minimum ages they have designated: purple, 14 years; green, 15 years; blue, 16 years]]
[[File:Mining diggerboys.jpg|thumb|Young diamond miners in Sierra Leone]]
According to the ILO, [[child labor]] is “work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is child labour|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/facts/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ILO classifies work conducted by children into three categories: children in employment, child labor, and hazardous work. The ILO condemns both child labor and hazardous work with the goal of eliminating hazardous child labor by 2016. In 2012, the ILO estimated that 168 million children (11% of the world’s children) were engaged in child labour, of which, 85 million engaged in hazardous work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making progress against child labour|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---ipec/documents/publication/wcms_221513.pdf|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ILO Convention No. 5 adopted in 1919 and entered into force in 1921 was the first ILO convention regulating child labour. Specifically, the main provision of the article stated “children under the age of fourteen years shall not be employed or work in any public or private industrial undertaking.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C005 - Minimum Age (Industry) Convention, 1919 (No. 5)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_ILO_CODE:C005|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception in 1919, several other ILO conventions had been adopted that have modified and expanded the initial 1919 convention. Today, the C138 [[Minimum Age Convention, 1973]] and C182 [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]] 1999 have replaced all the previous conventions. The Minimum Age Convention defines the minimum age children are allowed to work. Children, unless under special allowances, are not allowed to engage in hazardous work until the age of 18. The basic minimum age for child labor is 15 (14 for developing countries), and the minimum wage for light work, which may not interfere with education or vocational orientation and training, is 13 (12 for developing countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C138 - Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_ILO_CODE:C138|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  C182 urges all governments to take immediate action to identify and eliminate the worst forms of child labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C182 - Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_ILO_CODE:C182|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The following are defined as hazardous work according to the ILO:
* “Work which exposes children to physical, psychological, or sexual abuse
*Work underground, underwater, at dangerous heights, or in confined spaces
*Work with dangerous machinery, equipment, and tools, or which involves the manual handling or transport of heavy loads
*Work in an unhealthy environment which may, for example, expose children to hazardous substances, agents, or processes, or to temperatures, noise levels, or vibrations, damaging to their health
*Work under particularly difficult conditions such as work for long hours or during the night or work where the child is unreasonably confined to the premises of the employer” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eliminating the worst forms of child labour: A practical guide to ILO Convention No. 182 - Handbook for parliamentarians No. 3, 2002|url=http://www.ilo.org/pardev/civil-society/parliamentarians/WCMS_172685/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020224427/http://www.ilo.org/pardev/civil-society/parliamentarians/WCMS_172685/lang--en/index.htm|archivedate=20 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|C155|C161|C187}} Unsafe labour practices ===
[[File:Image of Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire on March 25 - 1911.jpg|thumb|Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire on March 25, 1911]]
Operating under the mantra that “decent work is safe work,” the ILO Programme on Safety and Health at Work and the Environment, SafeWork, has the goal of making work safer for all. According to the ILO, someone dies from a work-related accident or disease every 15 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safety and health at work|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/safety-and-health-at-work/lang--en/index.htm |publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unsafe labour practices have a long, sordid history. From the 1911 [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] to the 2013 [[West Fertiliser Company Explosion|fertilizer explosion]] in West, Texas, [[industrial disasters]] negatively affect the lives of workers and their dependents with high associated economic costs. Since its creation in 1919, ensuring worker safety has been one of the ILO’s fundamental missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Global strategy on occupational safety and health: Conclusions adopted by the International Labour Conference at its 91st Session, 2003|url=http://www.ilo.org/safework/info/policy-documents/WCMS_107535/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ILO has over its history adopted several conventions that have the goal of maximising worker safety and health. Currently, there are three fundamental conventions that are in effect: the Occupation Safety and Health Convention (C155, 1981), the Occupational Health Services Convention (C161, 1985), and the Promotional Framework for Occupational Safety and Health Convention (C187, 2006). The most recent convention has the stated aim of “promoting a preventative safety and health culture and progressively achieving a safe and healthy working environment.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Labour Standards on Occupational safety and health|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/subjects-covered-by-international-labour-standards/occupational-safety-and-health/lang--en/index.htm |publisher= International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One challenge that the ILO faces is the low ratification levels of the fundamental health and safety conventions.

== Criticisms ==
In addition to disagreements about the appropriate method of implementation for international labour standards, there are dissenting opinions concerning the validity of their existence at all.  The two most common arguments raised against international labour standards are that they undermine international competitiveness and erode domestic policy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

=== Undermines international competitiveness ===
A critique of international labour standards historically raised by right-of-centre economists is that they distort market forces, thus inhibiting employment and income.&lt;ref name=Kabeer3/&gt; According to right-wing economists, global free trade allows countries to specialise in those activities in which they have a [[comparative advantage]] and to reap mutual gains through exchange.  The international competitiveness of countries with large amounts of unskilled labour depends on their ability to provide low-cost workers.&lt;ref name=Kabeer3/&gt; Therefore, international standards would undermine any comparative advantage by increasing the cost of labour.  According to the conservative argument, international labour standards leave developing nations with a diminished export economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Labour standards in international trade agreements: an assessment of the arguments|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095851999340594|journal = The International Journal of Human Resource Management|date = January 1, 1999|access-date = 2015-04-24|issn = 0958-5192|pages = 351–375|volume = 10|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/095851999340594|first = George|last = Tsogas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of international labour standards often respond by arguing that this critique only attacks a particular aspect of enforcement rather than the standards themselves.  Furthermore, left-of-centre economists suggest that higher labour standards do not necessarily undermine competitiveness.&lt;ref name=Berik2006/&gt; Empirical evidence provided by Berik and Rodgers (2006) suggests that any costs of raising labour standards can easily be offset by incentives encouraging [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) and exports.&lt;ref name=Berik2006/&gt; Following this line of argument, not only do higher labour standards improve social and political stability, thus encouraging more foreign investment, but they also provide valuable investments in human capital that can lead to efficiency gains.&lt;ref name=Berik2006/&gt;

=== Erodes domestic policy ===
Another prominent argument against international labour standards is the notion that any attempt to harmonise set benchmarks for acceptable working conditions disregards, to some extent, the current state of an individual country’s unique economic and social climates.&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt; It is suggested that rather than adopting an internationally agreed upon group of labour standards, sovereign states are better off leaving labour market regulation to domestic policy.&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt; In this way, it is argued, a country can tailor a standard such as a minimum wage to the specific situation in that area of the world rather than trying to implement an ill-fitting uniform wage.&lt;ref name="Brown1"/&gt; In a 1996 study, Drusilla Brown, Alan Deardorff and Robert Stern use a variety of theoretical labour models to test the effectiveness of the harmonisation of international labour standards.&lt;ref name=Seminar3&gt;Brown, Drusilla K., Alan V. Deardorff and Robert M. Stern. [http://www. fordschool.umich.edu/rsie/workingpapers/ppp.html "International labour standards and trade: A theoretical analysis"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020012258/http://www/ |date=2011-10-20 }}, ''Research Seminar in International Economics'' 3 (1996), accessed March 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The study concludes that in theoretical cases, market failures that allow a breakdown in working environment conditions are most adequately remedied by labour standards.&lt;ref name=Seminar3/&gt; However, market failures are not uniform across countries and so it stands to reason that labour standards should not be constructed in an international way.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

An example of this critique can be seen by looking at the issue of child labour practices.  The case against harmonised international labour rights makes the point that the amount of child labour in a country is directly dependent on its level of economic development.&lt;ref name="Brown2"/&gt; Following this line of reasoning, poorer countries have a better chance at abolishing child labour through economic development rather than minimum age requirements. In fact, one study found that children 14 years and younger are not completely withdrawn from the labour force until GDP approaches $5000 per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Edmonds | first1 = E.

When Ivan was a young boy his parents changed the family name to Ivanović and converted to [[Catholicism]], along with many other [[Jews]] at the time.

After completing his early studies his parents sent him to [[Vienna]] where he became a [[Doctor of Law]]. In 1905 he became one of the founders of the Croatian National Progressive Party ({{lang|hr|Hrvatska narodna napredna stranka}}, NNS).&lt;ref name="SD-2002-09"&gt;{{cite news | language = Croatian | url = http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20020905/temedana03.asp | title = Tko je bio dr.

In 1918, as a member of the National Assembly of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes he helped to form the state.

In 1929, Ivanović built an [[oil refinery]] in Osijek named "IPOIL". In 1936, he started building the first [[aluminum]] factory in the [[Balkans]] in the town of [[Lozovac]] near [[Šibenik]], consulted by [[Elektrokemisk]],&lt;ref name="SD-2002-07"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20020725/sibenik04.asp | language = Croatian | newspaper = [[Slobodna Dalmacija]] | title = Centar hrvatske aluminijske industrije | quote = Tvornicu aluminija u Lozovcu 1936. počeo je graditi dr.

During the [[Second World War]] he was arrested and imprisoned for three years.&lt;ref name="SD-2002-09"/&gt; His first factory, IPOIL, was confiscated by the [[Independent State of Croatia]]. His second factory, IVANAL, was confiscated by the Italian occupying forces.&lt;ref name="SD-2002-09"/&gt; In 1946, the [[Communists]] accused him of being a "[[capitalist]] [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]" and in a plotted political process,&lt;ref name="SD-2002-09"/&gt; the [[Supreme Court of Croatia]] in [[Zagreb]] (case No. K-645/45 of 9 January) condemned both him and his wife and confiscated all the property of the company, including all the immovables and factory buildings. Ivanović was stripped of his [[civil rights]] and sent to a forced [[labor camp]].&lt;ref name="SD-2002-09"/&gt; After being released, he fled to [[Italy]] where he died in [[Genoa]] in 1949 aged 68.&lt;ref name="SD-2002-09"/&gt;

He and Milica Popovic had three children together, [[Vane Ivanović|Ivan]], [[Daška Ivanović|Daška]] and Vladimir. He had a third son named Dimitar with his second wife Jelka Muačević. In 1948, his third wife, Štefica Kastelic, gave birth to his fourth son, Marko, who became his legal successor.&lt;ref name="History of IVANAL"/&gt;

His granddaughter is socialite [[Tessa Kennedy]] and his great-grandchildren include actor [[Cary Elwes]] and producer [[Cassian Elwes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2520">'''Jørgen von Ansbach''' (ca. 1510 – ca. 1590) was a Norwegian timber merchant and [[mayor]] of [[Skien]].

He immigrated from [[Germany]] to [[Skien]] around 1540. He came as a [[mining]] administrator at a time when King [[Christian III of Denmark]] tried without success to establish a mining industry in [[Telemark|Bratsberg]] (now Telemark). He subsequently became a pioneer in the timber industry in the district as an owner of several sawmills and a major timber merchant. He organized efforts to make water flows from the Hjellevannet on the lower waterbasin in the Skien watercourse (''Skiensvassdraget'') to the Skien River (''Skienselva'') so that water could drive recovery saws. He established sawmills and the timber trade rose sharply in Skien.  He was cited as mayor of Skien in 1568, 1570 and 1578. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://snl.no/Skienselva/Porsgrunnselva|title=Skienselva/Porsgrunnselva|publisher= Store norske leksikon|author=  Svein-Gunnar Selland|accessdate= July 15,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://snl.no/Skiensvassdraget|title= Skiensvassdraget|publisher= Store norske leksikon|author=  Svein-Gunnar Selland

His considerable fortune was largely derived from the number of properties he owned in the city and district. These properties were divided between his five daughters whose descendants dominated the commercial life in Skien into the 17th century as timber merchants and estate owners. Among his descendants were [[Anne Clausdatter]] (1659–1713) who owned [[Borgestad Manor]] and [[Christian Cornelius Paus]] (1800–1879) who was Governor of Bratsberg. Among his more notable descendants was the playwright [[Henrik Ibsen]].

'''Managerialism''', on one level, involves [[belief]] in the value of [[professional]] [[manager]]s and of the concepts and methods they use.  Contemporary writers on [[management]] such as Thomas Diefenbach&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://www.amazon.com/Hierarchy-Organisation-Hierarchical-Management-Organizations/dp/0415843928 |title= Hierarchy and Organisation: Toward a General Theory of Hierarchical Social Systems |last= Diefenbach |first= Thomas |date= 2013-06-21 |publisher= Routledge |isbn= 9780415843928 |language= English}}&lt;/ref&gt; associate managerialism with [[hierarchy]]. But scholars have also linked managerialism to [[control (management) | control]],&lt;ref&gt;
For example:

 | quote =  Managerialism does not hold that the corporation is so driven by an organic principle that individual managers have no effective choice in giving it direction. Whether the organization behaves in an organic way is, to an important extent, a result of the management's efforts, and the direction of that organic force is something over which management attempts to exercise control. Thus, managerialism has not accepted the underlying determinism of capitalism and socialism.

 | quote = Accountability as managerialism [...] Hood and Lodge (2006: 186-187; Hood and Scott 2000) argue that NPM and managerialism have changed the nature of the public service bargain. [...] Thus, to demonstrate results, managerial accountability is employed with a combination of market accountability with more 'customer' focus to users of public services, and performance management regimes. The idea is to ensure that bureaucrats are more responsive to users of services (downward accountability) and report results and policy delivery to political masters (upward accountability). Ironically[,] managerial regimes have had unintended outcomes with civil servants becoming defensive about performance rather than being innovative - the exact opposite of what managerial regimes are designed to achieve (ibid).

American management experts Robert Locke and J C Spender see managerialism as an expression of a special group – management – that entrenches itself ruthlessly and systemically in an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://www.amazon.com/Confronting-Managerialism-Business-Economic-Controversies/dp/178032071X|title= Confronting Managerialism: How the Business Elite and Their Schools Threw Our Lives Out of Balance|last= Locke|first= Robert R.|last2= Spender|first2= J.-C.|date= 2011-09-08|publisher= Zed Books|isbn= 9781780320717|edition= 2011|language= English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It deprives owners of decision-making power and workers of their ability to resist managerialism. In fact the rise of managerialism may in itself be a response to people's resistance in society and more specifically to workers' opposition against managerial regimes.

Building on Enteman (1993) and Locke/Spender (2011), Thomas Klikauer in “Managerialism – Critique of an Ideology” (2013) defined managerialism thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://www.amazon.com/Managerialism-Critique-Ideology-T-Klikauer/dp/1137334266/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471326015&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Managerialism+%25E2%2580%2593+Critique+of+an+Ideology%25E2%2580%259D|title= Managerialism: A Critique of an Ideology|last= Klikauer|first= T.|date= 2013-09-12|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|isbn= 9781137334268|edition= 2013|language= English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://mlq.sagepub.com/content/42/3/355|title= Book review: Critical Management Ethics Thomas Klikauer.

Managerialism justifies the application of managerial techniques to all areas of society on the grounds of superior ideology, expert training, and the exclusive possession of managerial knowledge necessary to efficiently run corporations and societies." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Klikauer|first= Thomas|date= 2015-11-01|title= What Is Managerialism?|url= http://crs.sagepub.com/content/41/7-8/1103|journal= Critical Sociology|language= en|volume= 41|issue= 7-8|pages= 1103–1119|doi= 10.1177/0896920513501351|issn= 0896-9205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As the simple management of [[Henri Fayol]] (1841-1925) and [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] (1856-1915) mutated into managerialism, managerialism became a full-fledged ideology under the following formula:&lt;blockquote&gt;Management + Ideology + Expansion = Managerialism [http://amr.aom.org/content/39/4/566.extract]&lt;/blockquote&gt;Two examples of the extension of management into the non-management domain – the not for profit sphere of human existence – are public schools and universities. [http://sydney.edu.au/arts/economics/staff/profiles/tony.aspromourgos.php] In both cases, managerialism occurs when public institutions are run “as if” these were for-profit organization even though they remain government institutions funded through state taxes. In these cases, the term new public management has been used. [https://www.routledge.com/The-Ashgate-Research-Companion-to-New-Public-Management/Christensen-Laegreid/p/book/9780754678069] But the ideology of managerialism can even extend into more distant institutions such as, for example, a College of Physicians.[https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:2Mgeg558U3MJ:https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2015/202/10/scourge-managerialism-and-royal-australasian-college-physicians+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=au&amp;client=firefox-b]
----Albert A. Anderson summarized  managerialism as the ideological principle that sees societies as equivalent to the sum of the decisions and transactions made by the [[management]]s of organizations.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Compare what the historian James Hoopes wrote (2003):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[...] the main genesis of managerialism lay in the [[human relations movement]] that took root at the [[Harvard Business School]] in the 1920s and 1930s under the guiding hand of Professor [[Elton Mayo]]. Mayo, an immigrant from Australia, saw democracy as divisive and lacking in community spirit. He looked to corporate managers to restore the social harmony that he believed the uprooting experiences of immigration and industrialization had destroyed and that democracy was incapable of repairing."&lt;ref&gt;

== Managerialist ideology ==
The managerialist society is not one which responds to the needs, desires, and wishes of a majority of its citizens, but one which is influenced by organizations. The managerialist society responds to the managements of various organizations in relation to their transactions with each other. The needs, desires and wishes of the individual are heard through their membership of an organization. Furthermore, managerialism is both a process and a substantive ideology. Managerialism says that the fundamental social units are not individuals, as [[capitalism]] would declare, but rather that the fundamental social units are organizations. Ultimately, managerialism specifically denies that the fundamental nature of society is an aggregation of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Enteman|first= Willard F.|title= Managerialism : the emergence of a new ideology.|year= 1993|publisher= University of Wisconsin Press|location= Madison, Wi|isbn= 0299139247}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=January 2017}}

Instead, managerialism sees the core building-block of contemporary society as the modern [[business sector|business]] company or corporation. To further [[commerce|business]], companies, and corporations is the ideological goal of managerialism. How managerialism functions as such an ideology has been perfectly expressed by one of managerialism's main ideological flagships – the ''Harvard Business Review'' - when the ''HBR'''s former editor Joan Magretta (2012: 80-81) made the following stunning revelation:[[# edn1|[i]]]&lt;blockquote&gt; Business executives are society's leading champions of free markets and competition, words that, for them, evoke a world view and value system that rewards good ideas and hard work, and that fosters innovation and meritocracy. Truth be told, the competition every manager longs for is a lot closer to Microsoft's end of the spectrum than it is to the dairy farmers'. All the talk about the virtues of competition notwithstanding, the aim of business strategy is to move an enterprise away from perfect competition and in the direction of monopoly.
----[[# ednref1|[i]]]            Magretta, J. 2012. ''What Management Is: How it works and why it's everyone's business'', London: Profile.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Political ===
Managerialism in [[political science]] is a set of beliefs, attitudes and values which support the view that management is the most essential and desirable element of good administration and government. It follows that in all enterprises and services, both private and public, expertise in management must be taught by training and by incentives to excel. In the political world this may take the form of asserting that much conflict and argument are unnecessary for solving problems. All that is needed is a rational assessment of the problem and this involves gathering and collating information, listing the options, calculating costs of each, evaluating consequences and choosing the best course of action. Recent managerialism has included such devices as "[[performance indicator]]s" (purporting to measure the relative efficiencies of different managers) and "[[market testing]]" (which compares public sector managers' responsibilities and tasks with those of managers in the private sector in order to assess their pay). Managerialism is criticized for weakening the [[public service|public-service]] ethos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Enteman|first= Willard F.|title= Managerialism : the emergence of a new ideology.|year= 1993|publisher= University of Wisconsin Press|location= Madison, Wi|isbn= 0299139247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one were to conceive of society as a nation, such as the United States, managerialism concludes that there is no single United States and that individual Americans should not be identified as the fundamental nature of the country. Rather, the country is basically composed of numerous groups which collectively make up the country we call the United States. 
The government is a part of the managerial process. The management of different groups will attempt to influence the direction of government action. Their success or failure will depend upon their ability to pursue their case and upon their ability to blunt the cases of competitors. The success of the subunits depends upon the ability of their managements and other factors such as size, cohesiveness, managerial discretion, and control of resources. Government itself is a collection of governmental units. The government is not state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Bealey|first= Frank|title= The Blackwell dictionary of political science|year= 1999|publisher= Blackwell Publishers|location= Oxford, UK|isbn= 9780631206958|edition= 1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic ===
Economically, managerialism is the application of [http://smallbusiness.chron.com/management-techniques-2589.html managerial techniques] in businesses. Managerialism in this regard has to do with the strategic approach of [[goal-setting]]. In order to achieve previously unimagined levels of accumulation and production, businesses within a capitalist economy needed a way of connecting their strategic plan of actions to desired implementations of those plans. Within an organization, the individuals at the top of the organizational hierarchy determine a mission or set of goals, which is then strategically analyzed by individuals lower on the hierarchy (managers) to devise local goals to carry out the overall mission. Put simply, the managerial standard is to receive goals from above and to create new goals for those below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Preston|first= David Seth|title= The Rise of Managerialism|url= http://www.ffst.hr/ENCYCLOPAEDIA/doku.php?id=the_rise_of_managerialism|work= Encyclopaedia of Philosophy of Education|accessdate= 5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a belief that in managerialism, organizations have more similarities than differences, and thus the performance of all organizations can be optimized by the application of generic management skills and theory. To a practitioner of managerialism, there is little difference in the skills required to run a college, an advertising agency or an oil rig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Quiggin |first= John |title= Word for Wednesday: managerialism (definition) |publisher= johnquiggin.com |date= 2003-07-02 |url= http://johnquiggin.com/index.php/archives/2003/07/02/word-for-wednesday-managerialism-definition/ |accessdate= 2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experience and skills pertinent to an organization's core business are considered secondary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Methodology of Business Studies|last= Emmanuel|first= Mathew|publisher= Dorling Kindersley|year= 2010|isbn= 978-81-3173069-0|location= India|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "managerialism" can be used disparagingly to describe organizations perceived to have a preponderance or excess of managerial techniques, solutions, rules and personnel, especially if these seem to run counter to the common sense of observers. It is said{{by whom|date=January 2017}} that the MBA degree is intended to provide generic skills to a new class of managers not wedded to a particular industry or professional sector.&lt;ref&gt;"Managerialism Explained." ''Managerialism Explained''. Web. 25 Apr. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been mixed reviews on the efficacy of managerialism, explored extensively in university studies of the State. Some have accepted the flaws in the theory, building upon it and putting it forth as a valid theory of the State. Others have outright rejected such a proposition, responding that - regardless of the few similarities - such a system could not be successful on a political level.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The word "managerialism" can also be used pejoratively, as in the definition of a management caste. Robert R. Locke defines it accordingly as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"What occurs when a special group, called management, ensconces itself systemically in an organization and deprives owners and employees of their decision-making power (including the distribution of emolument), and justifies that takeover on the grounds of the managing group's education and exclusive possession of the codified bodies of knowledge and know-how necessary to the efficient running of the organization."&lt;ref&gt;

== New Managerialism ==
Managerialism  – also called New Managerialism and New Public Management – is an [[ideology]] used for legitimizing the development of new organizational forms and relationships. It has been coined a practical ideology of being 'business-like’ in order to make the new arrangements work for all forms of jobs, organizations, and education systems. The ‘business-like’ indicates what is called “as if” ideologies. Managerialism is conceptualized in that it seeks firstly to explain the [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] and political reasons behind why particular organizations  have been developed and, secondly, to describe the ways in which public services are currently being delivered. The idea of Managerialism came to fruition when  new organizational forms originated from a view that professional [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] modes of organization were inefficient and could not cope with the challenges rising from increasing globalization. Managerialism, however, has not remained static over the years as it has had many different versions of its implementation. Its linkage to the changing practices associated with an agenda moves away from a purely [[Neoliberalism|Neo-liberal]] framework. While neo-liberalism uses politics (e.g. elections) to achieve its goals, Managerialism is fundamentally anti-democratic following instead management’s [[Henri Fayol|command-and-control]] concept. While using business-like mechanisms to ensure great cost effectiveness is still used as a great technique. There have been movements away from purely market based systems that were in place strictly for efficiency, to contractual mechanisms and performance measurement through audit and review. In practice of Managerialism, consumers are redefined as well. Not only do consumers have choice in regard to where and how they receive their services, but they should be actively involved in determining what services should be provided as  well.&lt;ref&gt;Nickson, Alicen. 2014. "A Qualitative Case Study Exploring the Nature of New Managerialism in UK Higher Education and Its Impact on Individual Academics' Experience of Doing Research." Journal of Research Administration 45, no. 1: 47-80. Business Source Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed March 8, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In new Managerialism consumers are redefined as well. Not only should they have choice regarding where and how they receive their services, but they should be actively involved in determining what services should be provided as  well. The Managerialism explains public services not as production functions or firms, but as governance structures. What is at stake is not so much the ethos and practice of management as the culture and structure of governance. Here governance means the organisational culture and structure of the relationship between what [[Max Weber|Weber]] called legitimate domination and the self-constitution of those who are subject to it. What Weber meant by legitimate domination was justified by an authority structure, which was, in turn, legitimated by rational authority. Hence, one finds a renewed interest of Managerialism in fostering managerial leadership. But governance through Managerialism was never only dependent for its legitimization on Weber’s notion of [[legal-rational authority]], but more on forms of rationality that depend upon, for example, strategic management, cost-benefit-analysis, efficiency in the market, etc. Although this Managerialism draws on models of corporate Managerialism as well as accounts of New Public Management, it is also imbued with the practices of self in everyday life. What is new here, is recognition of the technologies of self that individuals employ to implicate themselves in their own governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eepat.net/doku.php?id=managerialism_and_education|title=Managerialism and Education|last=Fitzsimons|first=Patrick|date=01/07/1999|website=EEPAT|publisher=The Encyclopedia of Educational Philosophy and Theory|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates what became known as “The Entrepreneurial Self”. The way Managerialism achieves this, for example, at university levels is through a re-formulation of research and science, as outlined in the table below.

=== Influences ===
 '''George Elton Mayo''' 
''"One friend, one person who is truly understanding, who takes the trouble to listen to us as we consider our problems, can change our whole outlook on the work"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quotehd.com/quotes/elton-mayo-quote-one-friend-one-person-who-is-truly-understanding-who-takes-the-trouble-to|title=Elton Mayo Quotes|last=Mayo|first=Elton|date=|website=QuoteHD|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elton Mayo|George Elton Mayo]] was an Australian psychologist and organizational theorist. A former professor of [[Industrial Management]] at the Harvard Business School, Mayo heavily researched the behavior of workers at Western Electric; a manufacturing facet of AT&amp;T. Today he is considered a major contributor to the intellectual thought process and ideas of business management, as well as critical theories of industrial and organizational psychology.  His book, ''The Human Problems of an Industrialized Civilization''  articulates his collective thoughts taken from the famous Hawthorne research study conducted while at Harvard University.

 '''Karl Marx'''

''"Society does not consist of individuals but expresses the sum of interrelations, the relations within which these individuals stand."''&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, and David McLellan. ''The Grundrisse''. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx]] has set many standards in the fields of philosophy, economics, and sociology as one of the worlds most prominent thinkers. Commonly known for his ideas outlined in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' and ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Das Kapital]]'' Marx has exemplified ideas of management and order with his very apparent [[Socialism|socialistic views]].  Sociologically Marx has identified core interrelations between groups of people classified by class structures, and how those relations lead to the success or failures of a collective society.

 '''Friedrich Nietzsche''' 
''"To do great things is difficult; but to command great things is more difficult"''&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm, and Walter Arnold. Kaufmann. ''The Portable Nietzsche''. New York: Penguin, 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 19th century German philosopher, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] heavily contributed to the fields of management and leadership.  Focussing in on ideas of morality; particularly distinguishing the differences between what he labeled the, "master morality," and "slave morality," Nietzsche has exemplified the development of managerial practices through the subjections of moral emphasis and control. "He was especially interested, therefore, in a probing analysis and evaluation of the fundamental cultural values of Western philosophy, religion, and morality, which he characterized as expressions of the ascetic ideal."http://www.britannica.com/biography/Friedrich-Nietzsche

== History ==  
The history of Managerialism is linked to the teachings of [[Karl Marx]]. In his collection of books over capitalism appropriately named [[Capital: Critique of Political Economy|Das Kapital]] he writes about how when capitalist merge with other capitalist and two corporations come together, they are more likely to become diluted and when that happens those who were once wise business leaders were to be just aimless managers he stated his belief in his books (only volume 1 was published while he was alive) as follows, "Transformation of the actually functioning capitalist into a mere manager, an administrator of other people's capital, and of the owners of capital into mere owners, mere money-capitalists.".&lt;ref&gt;Jessop, Bob, and Russell Wheatley. ''Karl Marx's Social and Political Thought''. London: Routledge, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx is talking about what would later be known as Managerialism which is first used by [[James Burnham]] who in his book ''The Managerial Revolution'' expresses his ideas on the difference between Capitalism and Managerialism stating that when the owners of capital are no longer the ones in charge, and managers, relying on only principle are in charge then it is no longer [[Capitalism]], it is now considered Managerialism.  Burnham's ideas, in both that book and a subsequent book ''The Machiavellians'' and also in articles which were published in Partisan Review, and elsewhere are thoroughly criticised by [[George Orwell]] in his 1946 essay ''Second Thoughts on James Burnham'' (first published in ''Polemic'' (London).

'''Midtown Manhattan''' is the central portion of the [[boroughs of New York City|borough]] of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]]. Midtown is home to some of the city's most iconic buildings, including the [[Empire State Building]], the [[Chrysler Building]], and the [[headquarters of the United Nations]], as well as the [[Rockefeller Center]], [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], and [[Times Square]].

Midtown Manhattan is the largest [[central business district]] in the world and ranks among the most expensive pieces of real estate; [[Fifth Avenue]] in Midtown Manhattan commands the world's highest [[retail]] rents, with average annual rents at US{{convert|3,000|$/ft2|$/m2}} in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/opinion/a-plea-for-fifth-avenue.html |title=A plea for Fifth Avenue|author=Janette Sadik-Khan|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 9, 2017|accessdate=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Midtown is the country's largest commercial, entertainment, and media center, and also a growing financial center.

The majority of New York City's [[skyscraper]]s, including its tallest hotels and [[tower block|apartment towers]], are in Midtown.

==Location==
Geographically, the northern bound of Midtown Manhattan is commonly defined to be [[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]]; its southern boundary is less clear, and variously taken to be [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]], [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]], or even [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]]. Midtown spans the entire island of Manhattan along an east-west axis, bounded by the [[East River]] on its east and the [[Hudson River]] to its west. ''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'' defines Midtown as extending from 34th Street to 59th Street and from 3rd Avenue to 8th Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;Sclar, Elliot.

===Differing demarcations of Midtown Manhattan===
The border of Midtown Manhattan is nebulous and further confused by the fact that the term "Midtown Manhattan" can be used to refer either to a district or a group of neighborhoods and districts in Manhattan:
* The area between 14th and [[86th Street (Manhattan)|86th Streets]] includes roughly the center of Manhattan; however, the term Midtown Manhattan can also apply to the area between 31st Street and 59th Streets, although there are still office buildings south of 31st Street.
* The "Plaza District", a term used by Manhattan real estate professionals to denote the most expensive area of midtown from a commercial real estate perspective, lies between [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] and 59th Street, from [[Third Avenue]] to [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]], about a square kilometer or half a square mile.
* "Midtown South"  can refer to the part of Midtown between [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]] and around 42nd Street (although its northern boundary is defined differently depending on the source).
* "Midtown West" can refer to the area between 34th and 59th Streets, and between 5th and 12th Avenues.
* "Midtown East" can refer to the area between 42nd and 59th Streets, and between 5th Avenue and the East River.
* In 1982, the City of New York identified the "Manhattan Core" as the area that includes some of the City’s most populous neighborhoods, major institutions, parks and transit hubs, and the City’s primary Central Business District (CBD), defined as Manhattan below 60th Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/mn_core/mncore_es.pdf |title=Manhattan core public parking study|work= |accessdate=13 September 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110540/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/mn_core/mncore_es.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Manhattan Core" includes some areas slightly further north of 86th Street in Manhattan, as well as the area below 14th Street; however, this definition is problematic because it ignores the fact that Manhattan has not one but two zones in which people do business within this area separated by a wide swath of low-rise (by New York City standards) residential development — there is Midtown (which is ''in'' Midtown Manhattan), and the Financial District, (also known simply as "Downtown" because of its location in Downtown Manhattan). In other sources these districts are referred to as separate central business districts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cushwake.com/cwmbs2q11/PDF/off_us_cbd_2q11.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508231043/http://www.cushwake.com/cwmbs2q11/PDF/off_us_cbd_2q11.pdf |date=May 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paper chemicals''' designate a group of chemicals that are used for paper manufacturing, or modify the properties of [[paper]]. These chemicals can be used to alter the paper in many ways, including changing its color and brightness, or by increasing its strength and resistance to water.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Patt et al. "Paper and Pulp" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a18_545.pub4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pulping ==
Chemical pulping involves dissolving lignin in order to extract the cellulose from the wood fiber. The different processes of chemical pulping include the [[Kraft process]], which uses caustic soda and sodium sulfide and is the most common; alternatively, the use of sulfurous acid is known as the [[sulfite process]], the neutral sulfite semichemical is treated as a third process separate from sulfite, and [[soda pulping]] which is the least ecologically hazardous utilizing [[sodium hydroxide]] or [[anthraquinone]].&lt;ref name=ap42&gt;{{cite book|author1=Office of Air and Waste Management|author2=Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards|title=Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors|date=August 1977|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|location=Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711|isbn=978-1-249-50100-8|edition=3rd|url=http://www.arlis.org/docs/vol2/hydropower/APA_DOC_no._1762.pdf|accessdate=7 September 2015|format=PDF|chapter=10 Wood Processing|page=419|editor-last=Lahre|editor-first=Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caustic soda]] is added to increase the pH in the [[Pulp (paper)|pulping]] process of fibers. The higher pH of the paper-fiber solution causes the fibers to smoothen and swell, which is important for the grinding process of the fibers.

[[File:Florida Pulp and Paper Company mill, Cantonment, Florida.jpg|thumb|right|Processing pulp in a [[Hollander beater]]]]

== Bleaching ==
{{Main article|Bleaching of wood pulp}}

In the production of white paper, the wood pulp is bleached to remove any color from the trace amounts of lignin that was not extracted in the chemical pulping process. There are three predominant methods of bleaching:
# '''Elemental [[Bleaching of wood pulp#Chlorine_and_hypochlorite|chlorine bleaching]]''' uses [[chlorine]] and [[hypochlorite]].
# '''Elemental chlorine-free bleaching''' is more environmentally friendly since it eliminates the use of hypochlorite and replaces chlorine with [[chlorine dioxide]] or [[sodium chlorate]].&lt;ref name=akzo&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.akzonobel.com/eka/system/images/AkzoNobel_Eka%20Chemicals_ProductLine_WebRes_tcm56-60891.pdf |title=Performance chemicals for the pulp and paper industry |date=2011 |page=2 |publisher=EKA Chemicals/Akzo Nobel |location=Gothenburg, Sweden}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Totally chlorine-free bleaching''' utilizes [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]]. This is the most environmentally friendly process since it eliminates all chlorinated pollutants.&lt;ref name="EPA-TDD"&gt;{{cite report |date=October 1997 |chapter=7.3.9. Totally Chlorine-Free Bleaching of Papergrade Kraft Pulps | title=Supplemental Technical Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Pulp, Paper, and Paperboard Category |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/pulp-paper-and-paperboard-effluent-guidelines |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=7–26 |id=EPA-821-R-97-011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sizing ==
{{Main article|Sizing}}
Most paper types must have some water-resistance to maintain a specific writing quality and printability. Until 1980, the typical manner of adding this resistance was by using a [[rosin]] in combination with [[alum]]. When the paper industry started using chalk instead of [[china clay]] as filler, the paper chemistry had to switch to a neutral process. Today, mainly AKD ([[Diketene|alkyl ketene dimer]]) and ASA ([[alkenyl succinic anhydride]]) are used.

== Strengthening ==

=== Wet-strength ===
{{Main article|Wet strength}}

Wet-strength additives ensure that paper retains its strength when it gets wet. This is especially important in [[tissue paper]]. Chemicals typically used for this purpose include [[epichlorohydrin]], [[melamine]], [[urea formaldehyde]] and [[polyimine]]s. These substances polymerize in the paper and result in the construction of a strengthening network.

[[File:Cationic starch.jpg|thumb|Cationic starch]]

To enhance the paper's strength, [[cation]]ic starch is added to wet pulp in the manufacturing process. Starch has a similar chemical structure as the cellulose fibre of the pulp, and the surface of both the starch and fibre are negatively charged. By adding cationic (positive charged) starch, the fibre can bind with the starch and thus also increase the interconnections between the fibres. The positively charged portion of the starch is usually formed by [[quaternary ammonium cation]]s. Quaternary salts that are used include 2.3-epoxy propyl trimethyl ammoniumchloride (EPTAC, also known as or Glytac Quab, GMAC™) and (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) trimethyl ammonium chloride (CHPTAC, also known as Quat 188, Quab 188, Reagens™).

=== Dry-strength ===

Dry-strength additives, or dry-strengthening agents, are chemicals that improve paper strength normal conditions. These improve the paper's [[compression strength]], [[bursting strength]], [[tensile breaking strength]], and [[delamination resistance]]. Typical chemicals used include cationic [[starch]] and [[polyacrylamide]] (PAM) derivatives. These substances work by binding fibers, often under the aid of [[aluminum]] ions in paper sheet.

== Binders ==
Binders promote the binding of pigment particles between themselves and the coating layer of the paper.&lt;ref name=Surface1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fardim|first=Pedro|title=Paper and Surface Chemistry Part 1- Fiber Surface and Wet End Chemistry|journal=Institute of Quimica|year=2000|pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Binders are spherical particles less than 1&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter. Common binders are [[styrene maleic anhydride]] copolymer or styrene-acrylate copolymer.&lt;ref name=Surface2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fardim|first=Pedro|title=Paper and Surface Chemistry Part 2- Coating and Printability|journal=Institute of Quimica|year=2000|pages=1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surface chemical composition is differentiated by the [[adsorption]] of [[acrylic acid]] or an anionic [[surfactant]], both of which are used for stabilization of the dispersion in water.&lt;ref name=Granier&gt;{{cite journal|last=Granier|title=Adhesion of latex particles on inorganic surfaces|journal=Tappi J|year=1994|volume=77|issue=5|pages=419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-binders, or thickeners, are generally water-soluble polymers that influence the paper's color viscosity, water retention, [[sizing]], and gloss. Some common examples are [[carboxymethyl cellulose]] (CMC), cationic and anionic [[hydroxyethyl cellulose]] (EHEC), [[modified starch]], and [[dextrin]].
[[Styrene-butadiene|Styrene butadiene]] latex, Styrene acrylic, [[dextrin]], [[modified starch|oxidized starch]] are used in coatings to bind the filler to the paper. Co-binders are natural products such as starch and CMC ([[Carboxymethyl cellulose]]), that are used along with the synthetic binders, like styrene acrylic or styrene butadiene. Co-binders are used to reduce the cost of the synthetic binder and improve the [[Water retention curve|water retention]] and [[rheology]] of the coating.

[[File:Cationic starch.jpg|thumb|The molecular structure of cationic starch. The repeating unit of starch is derived from glucose interconnected with [[glycosidic bond]]s.]]

== Fillers ==
{{Main article|Filler (materials)}}

Mineral fillers are used to lower the consumption of more expensive binder material or to improve some properties of the paper.&lt;ref name=Ceresana&gt;{{cite web|title=Market Study: Fillers (3rd edition)|url=http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/additives/fillers/|publisher=Ceresana|accessdate=7 September 2015|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[China clay]], calcium carbonate, [[titanium dioxide]], and [[talc]] are common mineral fillers used in paper production.

&lt;!-- move pigments under filler maybe?? as per mention in this ref.. future ref / content source -&gt; https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/24645/nelson_kimberly_l_200708_phd.pdf --&gt;

== Retention ==
{{Main article|Retention agent}}

A Retention agent is added to bind [[Filler (materials)|fillers]] to the paper. Fillers, such as [[calcium carbonate]], usually have a weak surface charge. The retention agent is a polymer with high cationic, positively charged groups. An additional feature of a retention agent is to accelerate the dewatering in the wire section of the [[paper machine]]. [[Polyethyleneimine]] and polyacrylamide are examples of chemicals used in this process.

== Coating ==
{{Main article|Coated paper}}

=== Pigments ===
[[File:Paper Coating.png|thumb|Paper Coating]]

[[Pigment]]s that absorb in the yellow and red part of the visible spectrum can be added. As the [[dye]] absorbs light, the brightness of the paper will decrease, unlike the effect of an optical-brightening agent. To increase whiteness, a combination of pigments and an optical-brightening agent are often used. The most commonly used pigments are blue and violet dyes.

=== Optical-brightening agent ===

[[Optical brightener]] is used to make paper appear whiter. Optical-brightening agents use [[fluorescence]] to absorb invisible radiation from the [[ultraviolet]] part of the light spectrum and re-emit the radiation as light in the visible blue range. The optical-brightening agent thus generates blue light that is added to the reflected light. The additional blue light offsets the yellowish tinge that would otherwise exist in the reflected light characteristics. It thus increases the brightness of the material (when the illumination includes ultraviolet radiation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=He Shi, Hongbin Liu, Yonghao Ni, Zhirun Yuan, Xuejun Zou, Yajun Zhou |date=2012 |title=Review: Use of Optical Brightening Agents (OBAs) in the Production of Paper Containing High-Yield Pulps |url=http://ojs.cnr.ncsu.edu/index.php/BioRes/article/download/BioRes_07_2_2582_Shi_LNYZZ_Review_OBAs_High_Yield_Pulp/1529 |journal=BioResources |publisher= |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=2582–2591 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paying public domain''' ({{lang-fr|Domaine public payant}}, {{lang-es|dominio público pagante}}) is a [[copyright]] regime where copies, presentations or performances of a work that has entered the [[public domain]] are still subject to royalties, which are payable to the state or to an authors' association.
The principle is that revenue from the work of long-dead artists should be used to support creativity of living artists.
It may apply only to certain types of work, such as folklore or traditional cultural expressions.
However, communities that wish to control their traditional knowledge or cultural expressions may perceive the royalties as an unwelcome tax.
Paying public domain regimes have been introduced and withdrawn in several countries. 
They are still in place in several countries in South America and Africa.

==Origins==

[[Victor Hugo]], who also played an important role in developing the [[Berne Convention]], was one of the earlier supporters of the concept of ''domaine public payant'', under which a nominal fee would be charged for copying or performing works in the public domain, and this would go into a common fund dedicated to helping artists, especially young people.
At this time, copyright in France was weak. 
There was no post-mortem protection of works, but only a period of exploitation that started from the date of publication and could expire during the author's lifetime.{{sfn|Jomunsi|2018}}

==Definition==

A 1949 UNESCO report said that the normal sense of the term was that "after the expiration of the normal period of protection, that is, when the work falls into the public domain, the work cannot be freely used, as it could in the case of normal free public domain. Instead, the user must pay a royalty, generally to the authors' societies, who utilize such funds for cultural purposes or to aid needy authors or their families. In some cases, the state also participates in such fees."{{sfn|UNESCO|1949|p=1}}
A 2010 WIPO report said that under these regimes "a fee is imposed for the use of works in the public domain. Generally, the system works like a compulsory license: the use is conditioned on payment of the prescribed fee but not upon the securing of a prior authorization."{{sfn|Marzetti|2017|p=2}}

Fees payable to the state and/or the authors' society vary from country to country.{{sfn|UNESCO|1949|p=2}}
The user must pay the fee, but does not have to obtain prior authorization.
The fee may only be applicable to commercial exploitation of the material.
It usually applies only to works that have entered the public domain because their copyright has expired, but in some countries it applies to expressions of folklore.{{sfn|WIPO Secretariat|2010|p=11}}
Usually the fees are used to fund young or struggling creators, or to promote creative works, but in Algeria they are used to preserve the public domain itself.
The cost of administration may absorb much of the money, but if the fees are to high they may discourage use of public domain materials.{{sfn|WIPO Secretariat|2010|p=12}}

The concept has been proposed as a way to protect traditional cultural expressions, but may not be suitable for communities more interested in control over traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions than in compensation.{{sfn|WIPO Secretariat|2010|p=12}}
It might be difficult to establish the true owners and the types of work to which it would apply, and it could be seen simply as a form of taxation.{{sfn|Marzetti|2017|p=4}}

==Countries==
The 1949 UNESCO report said there were only five countries that had laws that adopted this system: Uruguay (since 1937), Bulgaria (since 1939), Italy (since 1941), Rumania [sic] (since 1946) and Yugoslavia (since 1946).
The report thought that some form of ''domaine public payant'' might also apply in Russia.
In Bulgaria, Uruguay and Yugoslavia, the rule applied to any sort of public domain work.
In Italy it was limited to presentation of works intended for public showing and musical works, and to books.
In Rumania it applied to publication and representation of literary and dramatic works.
In Bulgaria the duration lasted for 20 years after the work entered the public domain, but in the other countries it was perpetual.{{sfn|UNESCO|1949|p=1}}

In the past Brazil (1973–83), Italy (1882–1925 and 1941–96), France (1956–76) and Mexico (1963–93) had paying public domain regimes, but have since abolished them.{{sfn|Marzetti|2017|p=5}}
A 1984 article listed Argentina, Italy, Mexico and the USSR among the countries that had adopted some form of the system.{{sfn|Mouchet|1983–1984|p=137}}
A 2017 article noted that in Argentina and Uruguay a fee was payable to the state for almost every use of works in the public domain, whether or not for commercial purposes, including reproduction, publication, performance and broadcasting.{{sfn|Marzetti|2017|p=1}}

The 2010 WIPO report noted the paying public domain was still in force in Algeria, Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal, Republic of the Congo, Côte d’Ivoire and Paraguay. 
It explained that the Bangui Agreement of the OAPI ([[Organisation Africaine de la Propriété Intellectuelle]]) and its Annex on literary and artistic property provided for such a regime for exploitation of expressions of folklore and works or productions that have fallen into the public domain.{{sfn|Marzetti|2017|p=3}}
A similar system, called "Community Intellectual Rights", has been proposed in Latin America, inspired in part by Peru's Law No. 27811.
The concept is that "traditional knowledge should stay in the public domain for anyone to use, but originators should share in the benefits when it is used for commercial purposes. Furthermore, these rights should not be subject to time limits.{{sfn|Busch|2015|p=267}}

There have been proposals to introduce a ''domaine public payant'' system across Europe, but as of 2001 the idea had not gained much support.{{harv|Stokes|2001|p=63}}
The German Writers Union has proposed a modern version on the grounds that ''droit de suite'' and ''domaine public payant'' should be linked, since ''droit de suite'' usually benefits the distant heirs of dead artists rather than being used to encourage living artists.
A proposal discussed and rejected for the 1993 Term Directive was that the last 20 years of ''post mortem auctoris'' fees should be used to benefit living artists rather than the artist's heirs.{{sfn|Stokes|2001|p=64}}

==Sample laws==
Under Algeria's 19 July 2003 Copyrights and Related Rights Act, works of  traditional cultural heritage and national works considered as public
property are granted special protection [Article 8].
The National Bureau of Copyrights and Neighboring Rights protects these works [Article 139].
Their use is subject to a license from the Bureau, and if the use is profitable a royalty is payable to the Bureau [Article 140].{{sfn|Algeria|2003}}

Burundi Act 1/021 2005 Article 25 says:
*Works in the public domain shall be placed under the protection of the State, represented by the Ministry in charge of culture.
*The public representation or performance or the direct or indirect fixation of works in the public domain and of works exclusively composed of elements borrowed from works that have fallen into the public domain, with a view to exploitation for profit, are subject to regulations on royalties under conditions that shall be determined by an order of the Ministry in charge of culture.  
*The revenue from the collection of royalties for the use of works in the public domain shall be devoted to social and cultural purposes.{{sfn|Act No. 1/021 of December 30, 2005 ... Burundi|loc=Art 25}}

Cape Verde ''Decree-Law No. 1/2009'' of April 27, 2009 says "The use and exploitation, for financial gain, of works in the public domain shall be free as long as such use is subordinate to absolute respect for the moral rights, on the previous authorization of the member of Government responsible for culture and the payment of a fee to be set by the members of Government responsible for culture and finance, with the purpose of promotion and cultural development and social assistance to Cape Verdean authors."{{sfn|Cape Verde|2009|loc=Article.34(4)}}

{{Capitalism}}
'''Post-capitalism''' includes a number of proposals for a new [[economic system]] to replace [[capitalism]], examine more [[Advanced capitalism|advanced]] forms, or otherwise speculate on the fate of the current form of the social order. According to some [[Classical Marxism|classical Marxist]] and some [[Social evolution|social evolutionary theories]], post-capitalist societies may come about as a result of spontaneous evolution as capitalism becomes obsolete. Others propose models to intentionally replace capitalism. The most notable among them are [[socialism]] and [[anarchism]].

==Transition forces==
In 1993, [[Peter Drucker]] outlined a possible evolution of capitalistic society in his book ''[[Post-Capitalist Society]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Drucker|first1=Peter F.|title=Post-Capitalist Society|date=1993|publisher=HarperInformation|isbn=978-0-7506-0921-0|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780750609210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book stated that knowledge, rather than capital, land, or labor, is the new basis of wealth. The classes of a fully post-capitalist society are expected to be divided into knowledge workers or service workers, in contrast to the [[Bourgeoisie|capitalists]] and [[Proletariat|proletarians]] of a capitalist society. In the book, Drucker estimated the transformation to post-capitalism would be completed in 2010–2020.

Drucker also argued for rethinking the concept of intellectual property by creating a universal licensing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwartz|first1=Peter|title=Post-Capitalist|url=https://www.wired.com/1993/03/drucker-2/|accessdate=17 March 2016|work=WIRED|date=1 March 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers would subscribe, for a cost and producers would assume that everything is reproduced and freely distributed through social networks.

In 2015, according to [[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]] the rise of income inequality, repeating cycles of unemployment and inflation and capitalism’s contributions to global warming had led both economists and philosophers to begin seriously considering post-capitalistic societies. Post-capitalism is expected to arise with further advances in automation and information sharing – both of which cause production costs to approach zero.&lt;ref name=PostCapMason&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mason|first1=Paul|title=PostCapitalism: A Guide to our Future|date=2015|publisher=Allen Lane|isbn=9781846147388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological drivers of post-capitalism==
The emergence of post-capitalist dynamics were made possible through three major changes that were brought by the evolution and increasing sophistication of information technology. A first driver is a new dynamic that information technology brought to the workplace. Through increased connectivity the reachability of employees was improved and the lines between working hours and free time became blurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=N. Korody|title=Architecture after capitalism, in a world without work|url=http://uk.archinect.com/features/article/149935222/architecture-after-capitalism-in-a-world-without-work?ukredirect|accessdate=25 Jun 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to that, the technological era led to an abundance of information that is easily retainable for everyone. While some industries only continued to exist due to information scarcity and secrecy, the market became disrupted by the emergence of new competitors that were able to enter the market and benefit from large sources of publicly-available information. A result of this was the increase in acquisition activities since the early 2000s which tried to counter decreasing margins through consolidation and monopoly building. A third dynamic that emerged from new technology was [[crowd-funding]] and [[crowd-sourcing]]. Crowd-funding led to a new option for corporate finance, which was often achieved for socially-accepted innovations. Crowd-sourcing on the other hand challenged the traditional employee-employer relationship under capitalism as people started to voluntarily contribute to product developments with a distinctive skill, such as programming or designing. A major reward for people engaged in crowd-sourcing is not monetary compensation, but the intrinsic reward of having a stake in an active development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=P. Mason|title=Three dynamics leading to post-capitalism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/17/postcapitalism-end-of-capitalism-begun|accessdate=25 Jun 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socialism==
Socialism often implies public ownership of companies and a planned economy, though it is argued{{by whom|date=May 2017}} whether either are essential features. In his book ''[[PostCapitalism: A Guide to our Future]]'', [[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]] argues that centralized planning, even with the advanced technology of today, is unachievable.&lt;ref name=PostCapMason /&gt; Alternatively, [[Michael Albert]] and [[Robin Hahnel]] argue that central planning is key to creating a [[Participatory economics|participatory economy]].

For post-capitalism to come from a socialist standpoint, a political and cultural transformation would need to occur alongside the economic transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Albert|first1=Michael|last2=Hahnel|first2=Robin|title=Unorthodox Marxism: An Essay on Capitalism, Socialism, and Revolution|date=1978|publisher=South End Press|isbn=0896080048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Albert|first1=Michael|last2=Hahnel|first2=Robin|title=Socialism Today and Tomorrow|date=1981|publisher=South End Press|isbn=0896080773}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Albert|first1=Michael|last2=Hahnel|first2=Robin|title=Marxism and Socialist Theory: Socialism in Theory and Practice|date=1981|publisher=South End Press|isbn=0896080765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Robin Hahnel]] states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hahnel|first1=Robin|title=What Is To Be Done?|url=https://zcomm.org/znetarticle/what-is-to-be-done-by-robin-hahnel-1/|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|text=Our defense strategy—and we will need one—must be centered on organizing for massive resistance and non-compliance since no elite, no matter how well armed, can rule unless we, the people, carry out their orders.}}

Helpful definitions involving socialism:
* [[Socialism]], an economic system based on public or cooperative ownership of the [[means of production]] where production is carried out to directly produce [[use-value]], that includes a moneyless form of accounting such as [[Calculation in kind|physical resource accounting]] or [[Labour voucher|labor-time]] and based on the direct production of utility rather than on the capitalist laws of accumulation and value. Some models of socialism imply [[economic planning]] for the allocation of the factors of production in place of [[capital market]]s, while other models of socialism retain market-based allocation of capital goods. Some Marxists believe socialism would eventually in turn evolve into [[communism]].
* [[Economic planning|Planned socialism]], a type of socialism where some form of economic planning substitutes markets for allocating the [[factors of production]] and for coordinating the economy. There are various types of planning, including [[central planning]] and [[Decentralized planning (economics)|decentralized planning]]; [[material balance planning]], input-output planning and computerized planning.
* [[Market socialism]], a type of socialism based on [[Socialization (economics)|socialization]] and public or cooperative ownership of the means of production, but retains monetary calculation and market competition and utilizes markets as the primary way of allocating the factors of production.
* [[Communalism (political philosophy)|Communalism]], a political theory based on the writings of [[Murray Bookchin]]. Bookchin developed Communalism after he broke with anarchism believing it to be individualist and lifestylist. It is based on [[libertarian municipalism]], [[confederalism]] and [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]].

==Participatory economy==
{{main|Participatory economy}}
In his book ''Of the People, By the People: The Case for a Participatory Economy'', [[Robin Hahnel]] describes a post-capitalist economy called the [[Participatory economics|participatory economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hahnel|first1=Robert|title=Of the People, By the People: The Case for a Participatory Economy|date=2012|publisher=AK Press Distribution|isbn=0983059764}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book ends with the proposal of the [[Green New Deal]], a package of policies that address [[climate change]] and [[Financial crisis|financial crises]].

The participatory economy focuses on the participation of all citizens through the creation of worker councils and consumer councils. Hahnel emphasizes the direct participation of worker and consumers rather than appointing representatives. The councils are concerned with large-scale issues of production and consumption and are broken into various bodies tasked with researching future development projects.

In a participatory economy, economic rewards would be offered according to need, the amount of which would be determined democratically by the workers council. Hahnel also calls for "economic justice" by rewarding people for their effort and diligence rather than accomplishments or prior ownership.  A worker’s effort is to be determined by their co-workers. Consumption rights are then rewarded according to the effort ratings. The worker has the choice to decide what they consume using their consumption rights. Hahnel does not address the idea of money, currency, or how consumption rights would be tracked.

Planning in a participatory economy is done through the councils. The process is horizontal across the committees as opposed to vertical. All council members, the workers and consumers, participate directly in planning unlike in Soviet-type economies and other democratic planning proposals in which planning is done by representatives. Planning is an iterative procedure, always being changed and improved upon, that is accomplished at the level of either work or consumption. All information and proposals are freely available to everyone, those inside and outside of the council, so that the social cost of each proposal can be determined and voted on. Long-term plans such as structuring public transportation, residential zones and recreational areas, are to be proposed by delegates and approved by [[direct democracy]] (i.e. voting by the population).

Hahnel argues that a participatory economy will return empathy to our purchasing choices. Capitalism removes the knowledge of how and by whom a product was made: "When we eat a salad the market systematically deletes information about the migrant workers who picked it".&lt;ref name=PP&gt;{{cite web|last1=Albert|first1=Michael|last2=Hahnel|first2=Robin|title=Participatory Planning|url=http://www.walkingbutterfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/participatory-planning-michael-albert-robin-hahnel.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By removing the human element from goods, consumers only consider their own satisfaction and need when consuming products. Introducing worker and consumer councils would reintroduce the knowledge of where, how and by whom products were manufactured. A participatory economy is expected to also introduce more socially oriented goods, such as parks, clean air, and public health care, through the interaction of the two councils.

For those that call the participatory economy [[utopia]]n, Albert and Hahnel counter:&lt;ref name=PP/&gt; {{quote|text=Are we being utopian? It is utopian to expect more from a system than it can possibly deliver. To expect equality and justice—or even rationality—from capitalism is utopian. To expect social solidarity from markets, or self-management from central planning, is equally utopian. To argue that competition can yield empathy or that authoritarianism can promote initiative or that keeping most people from decision making can employ human potential most fully: these are utopian fantasies without question. But to recognize human potentials and to seek to embody their development into a set of economic institutions and then to expect those institutions to encourage desirable outcomes is no more than reasonable theorizing. What is utopian is not planting new seeds but expecting flowers from dying weeds.}}

==Anarchism==
* [[Anarchist communism]], a hybrid of [[communism]] and [[anarchism]] advocating (among others) decision making by direct and/or consensus democracy, abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]] and abolition of [[private ownership]] of the [[means of production]].
* [[Post-scarcity economy|Post-scarcity]] [[anarchism]], an economic system based on [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]], [[libertarian municipalism]] and an [[Abundance (economics)|abundance]] of fundamental resources.
* [[Anarcho-syndicalism]], an ideology centred on [[Worker's self-management|self-management of labour]], [[socialism]] and [[direct democracy]].

==Other==
* [[Economic democracy]], a [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] [[philosophy]] that establishes democratic control of firms by their workers and social control of investment by a network of public banks.&lt;ref name="After Capitalism"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schweickart |first=David |title=After Capitalism |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. |isbn=0-7425-1299-1 |year=2002 |pages=22–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Heritage check system, a socioeconomic plan that retains a market economy, but removes fractional reserve lending power from banks and limits government printing of money to offset deflation with money printed being used to buy materials to back the currency, pay for government programs in lieu of taxes, with the remainder to be split evenly among all citizens to stimulate the economy (termed a "heritage check" for which the system is named). As presented by the original author of the idea, [[Robert Heinlein]], in his book ''[[For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs]]'', the system would be self-reinforcing and eventually result in a regular heritage checks able to provide a modest living for most citizens.&lt;ref name="For Us, The Living"&gt;{{cite book |last=Heinlein |first=Robert |title=For Us, The Living |publisher=Scribner |isbn=0-7432-5998-X |year=2003 |pages=233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quota Elimination''' is an initiative to eliminate the use of [[Import quota|quotas]] in all [[textile]] and [[clothing]] trade between nations which are members of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). Doing so was one of the key commitments undertaken at the  WTO [[Uruguay Round]] in 1994 to retire the [[Multi Fibre Arrangement]]. The ATC, that is the WTO [[Multi Fibre Arrangement|Agreement on Textile and Clothing]], is the regulation governing textile and clothing and implements this commitment. 

The agreement established a ten-year period which would eliminate the use of quotas in all textile and clothing trade between WTO nations.  It expired on December 31, 2004. As of January 1, 2005, the garment and fabric trade worldwide is operating without quotas.  To ensure the respect of [[Bilateralism|bilateral]] textile agreements, goods shipped prior to January 1, 2005 and subject to the 2004 quotas will be subject to the import regime of 2004 even if they are presented to [[customs]] before January 1.  

To avoid excessive burdens on trade and customs, as of April 1, 2005, all garments and fabrics will trade freely into the [[European Union]] (EU). Although the quotas have been eliminated, the regulation also sets up a [[Statistics|statistical]] monitoring system for the imports of textiles and clothing into the EU.

''MalaysianReserve'', 17 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Techfast Holdings's conditional voluntary takeover offer by Wong to acquire all the remaining shares in the company could only gather 22.48% of the share capital in Techfast with the offer tabled.

== Biography ==

=== Early years and ''Uncle Sam''===
As a [[teenager]], Robert Geiss did not want to go to school because he thought that "if you want to make [[money]], you cannot sit at school every day". His father Reinhold Geiss offered him a job as a [[tradesman]] in his company, which Robert Geiss declined. He then went on holiday to [[Spain]], where he bought a pair of fitness trousers that he liked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Markus Lanz (vom 08. Mai 2013)|language=German|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9PXhYsZksI|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned to Cologne, Geiss decided to design similar clothing for German fitness studios and founded ''Uncle Sam'' in 1986. Having sold his inventory very quickly over the winter season, Geiss started buying shirts and pants for 10 [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] in [[Turkey]]. He then re-sold them for 49 DM in Germany. At the height of his success, Geiss employed 120 people. At some point, [[Kaufhof AG]] wanted to buy the firm, but Geiss declined because of legal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Markus Lanz (vom 08. Mai 2013)|language=German|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAeWLER6E4M|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 he finally sold his company for an undisclosed amount to an anonymous buyer and moved to Monaco with his wife Carmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Robert Geiss Vermögen|language=German|url=http://www.vermoegen.org/robert-geiss-vermoegen/|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to work and family ===
After ten years of partying and living the jet-set life, Geiss started to engage in buying, refurbishing and reselling luxury real estate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/tv/die-geissens/wie-reich-sind-sie-wirklich-36380434.bild.html Bild] Retrieved 6 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RAAB"&gt;{{cite news|title=Die Geissens zu Gast bei Stefan Raab|language=German|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sruSARA0Tl8|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 his brother bought back ''Uncle Sam'' and became [[CEO]] of the company. Being friends with [[banker]]s in Monaco, Geiss also invested in the stock market.&lt;ref name="RAAB"/&gt; On May 30, 2003 his first daughter Davina Shakira was born, followed by his second daughter, Shania Tyra Maria on July 30, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Die Geissens sind der Schrecken aller Millionäre.|language=German|url=https://www.welt.de/fernsehen/article109117192/Die-Geissens-sind-der-Schrecken-aller-Millionaere.html|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Present: ''Die Geissens'' ===
Since January 2011 he is one of the main characters in the RTL2 TV series ''Die Geissens – Eine schrecklich glamouröse Familie'' alongside his family. In the beginning of March 2013 he started designing for his new label ''Roberto Geissini'', which became a popular fashion brand in Germany, [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Luxembourg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Geissens-Comeback!

'''Roberto Duailibi''' (born October 8, 1935 in [[Campo Grande, Brazil]]), is a Brazilian advertising executive.

== Biography ==

Graduated in [[advertising]] from Escola de Propaganda de São Paulo in 1956, Roberto Duailibi became a publicist. He initiated his career in advertising in 1952, at the [[Colgate-Palmolive]] company. From 1956, he worked as copywriter in advertising agencies such as CIN - Companhia de Incremento de Negócios (now [[Leo Burnett]] Publicidade Ltda), JWT, McCann Ericson and Standard Propaganda, where he was Creative vice-president.

In 1968, he joined José Zaragoza, Francesc Petit and Ronald Persichetti to create DPZ, one of the largest and most awarded advertising agencies in Brazil. He was awarded the "Advertiser of the Year" in 1969 in Prêmio Colunistas. &lt;br&gt;
In addition to the recognition and awards as advertising executive, Roberto Duailibi is a writer and professor . He was professor and course director at ESPM of São Paulo and is currently dean in the Institution Council. He was also Creative professor at ECA - [[Escola de Comunicações e Artes]] of USP - Universidade de São Paulo.&lt;br&gt; For two periods, he was [[chairman]] at ABAP, the Brazilian Association of Advertising Agencies. He is advisor of Fundação Bienal de São Paulo, Fundo Social de Solidariedade of the São Paulo State Government and Chairman at FUNCEB - Fundação Cultural Exército Brasileiro.

He wrote several books, among which is Criatividade &amp; [[Marketing]], with Harry Simonsen Jr.. This book showed the concept of the heuristic ruler and the importance to follow methods encouraging creativity across the company’s departments. In addition to Criatividade &amp; Marketing, he was very successful with his quote collections initially called Phrase Book. In 2005, he published Cartas a um Jovem Publicitário, a book directed to the young advertising professionals. In 2008, he published with Marina Pechlivanis the collection Idéias Poderosas, gathering thematic selections of [[quotation]]s in a pocket book. In the same year, he also launched the new edition of Criatividade &amp; Marketing, with a digital version of the Heuristic Ruler.

Gorkov was born in [[Gai, Orenburg Oblast]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], in 1968, to Nikolai Gorkov and Lyubov Gorkova.

==Career==
===Early career and Yukos===
[[File:Putin and Gorkov February 2017.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Vladimir Putin]] and Gorkov meet at the Kremlin, February 2017]]
Gorkov later worked with [[Bank Menatep]] (1994–1997) before joining the [[Yukos]] oil company and Yukos Moscow (1997–2005), all of which are now defunct. He was a vice president at Yukos, where he oversaw personnel and pensions. He was also engaged in a social outreach program, Yukos' own youth movement called "New Civilization" ({{lang-ru|«Новая Цивилизация»}}). The movement, which was extremely costly, had a mission to change Russia, and involved summer camps and young people engaging in the political system with their own party and parliament.&lt;ref name="forbes217"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rudenko|first1=Pyotr|title="У него все хорошо при нынешнем режиме": кто такой Сергей Горьков|url=http://www.forbes.ru/finansy/igroki/313415-u-nego-vse-khorosho-pri-nyneshnem-rezhime-kto-takoi-sergei-gorkov|accessdate=25 May 2017|work=[[Forbes|Forbes Russia]]|date=26 February 2017|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Yukos began to collapse under a massive tax scandal amid [[Yukos shareholders vs. Russia|lawsuits against the Russian government]]. ''[[Forbes]]'' stated it was a large mystery how Gorkov managed to avoid arrest, but inside sources (including [[Pavel Ivlev]]) stated it was through his connections with the Kremlin and the [[Federal Security Service|FSB]].&lt;ref name="guardian6317"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luhn|first1=Alec|title=Who is Sergei Gorkov, the powerful Russian banker who met Jared Kushner?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/03/sergei-gorkov-russian-banker-jared-kushner|accessdate=3 June 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yukos CEO [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]], an enemy of Russian leader [[Vladimir Putin]], was imprisoned for eight years for fraud and tax evasion, a conviction that drew skepticism in the West. Gorkov's subordinate, Alexei Kurtsin, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for embezzlement and served eight.&lt;ref name="forbes217"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharkov|first1=Damien|title=Who is Sergey Gorkov, the Russian banker Jared Kushner allegedly met?|url=http://www.newsweek.com/sergey-gorkov-grad-russian-banker-kushner-617422|accessdate=31 May 2017|work=[[Newsweek]]|date=30 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, after the Yukos fiasco, Gorkov moved to [[London]], where he worked with several companies. He sat on the board of directors for Eton Energy Ltd. and for liquor company New Muscovy Company Ltd. Gorkov returned to Russia in 2006.&lt;ref name="forbes217"/&gt; From 2005 to 2008, he sat on the board of directors of [[FESCO Transport Group]], Russia's largest intermodal transport operator.&lt;ref name="oren"/&gt;

===Sberbank===
Gorkov moved into the banking sector in November 2008, when he joined the state-owned [[Sberbank of Russia|Sberbank]] as director of personnel. During the recession, Gorkov oversaw an overhaul of the workforce, reducing the number of employees from 270,000 to 240,000 to increase efficiency and profit.&lt;ref name="kommersantbio"&gt;{{cite news|title=Горьков Сергей Николаевич|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2925502|accessdate=31 May 2017|work=Kommersant|date=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also led a retraining program, with 200,000 of the employees receiving some form of retraining, and introduced an employee evaluation system that led to monthly bonuses for the best employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chaikina|first1=Yulia|title=Сбербанк: реформ невпроворот|url=http://www.forbes.ru/karera/menedzhment/53487-sberbank-reform-nevprovorot|accessdate=31 May 2017|work=[[Forbes]]|date=27 July 2010|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorkov was tremendously successful during his first five years at Sberbank; Gorkov was appointed deputy chairman of the board of Sberbank in October 2010. He was promoted to run its international operations division and helped it expand its business reach from two countries to 20.&lt;ref name="vebbio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes217"/&gt; Its international expansion included acquisitions of Volksbank of Austria and [[DenizBank]] of Turkey. Starting in October 2012, Gorkov was chairman of Sberbank's division in [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref name="oren"/&gt;

===VEB===
In February 2016, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] promoted Gorkov to chairman of [[Vnesheconombank]] (VEB), succeeding [[Vladimir Dmitriev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Путин назначил Сергея Горькова главой ВЭБ|url=http://tass.ru/ekonomika/2697259|accessdate=25 May 2017|work=ТАСС|date=26 February 2017|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Russian sources, Gorkov's connection to the FSB played a part in his appointment to lead VEB; Putin, the former director of the FSB, has appointed several of its members to important roles in Russian government.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt; Founded in 1922, Vnesheconombank is one of the oldest banks in Russia, but was acquired as a state development bank in 2007. During the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|financial crisis of 2007–08]], Vnesheconombank's status as a state-owned bank forced it to assist the government with the domestic economy. It reorganized struggling banks, purchased two steel companies, bought 175 billion rubles (approximately $3 billion) of sagging shares of Russian companies to keep them afloat, and also heavily invested in struggling [[Banking in Ukraine|Ukrainian banks]].&lt;ref name="rbc"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tkachev|first1=Ivan|last2=Polyakova|first2=Yulia|title=Проблема в $20 млрд: как Банк развития превратился в черную дыру|url=http://www.rbc.ru/finances/18/02/2016/56c4a49a9a79475ba1d428f9|accessdate=30 May 2017|publisher=RBC|date=18 February 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VEB, which has been dubbed Vladimir Putin's "pet bank" and "slush fund" by Western observers, also lent significantly for the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]], covertly funded pro-Russian groups in Ukraine, and has frequently bailed out [[Russian oligarch]]s close to Putin.&lt;ref name="nytimes529"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mazzetti|first1=Matthew|last2=Rosenberg|first2=Mark|last3=Haberman|first3=Maggie|title=Investigation Turns to Kushner’s Motives in Meeting With a Putin Ally|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/29/us/politics/jared-kushner-russia-investigation.html|accessdate=30 May 2017|work=The New York Times|date=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Foreign Policy]]''{{'}}s assessment, VEB "functions as an off-the-books kitty that allows President Vladimir Putin to reward his allies and shower money on his pet projects and political priorities."&lt;ref name="fp"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Groll|first1=Elias|title=Why Is Putin's 'Private Slush Fund' Courting Jared Kushner?|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/04/07/why-is-putins-private-slush-fund-courting-jared-kushner/|accessdate=30 May 2017|work=[[Foreign Policy]]|date=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Gorkov arrived in 2012, VEB was struggling to stay afloat; it reportedly needed 1.3 trillion rubles (approximately $22.8 billion) by 2020 to avoid defaulting on its debt.&lt;ref name="forbes217"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Solodkov|first1=Vasily|title=Что не так с ВЭБом: почему, несмотря на господдержку, он убыточен|url=http://www.forbes.ru/biznes/335495-chto-ne-tak-s-vebom-pochemu-nesmotrya-na-gospodderzhku-po-prezhnemu-ubytochen|accessdate=26 May 2017|work=[[Forbes]]|date=19 December 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the bank received a $20 billion bailout&lt;ref name="dailybeast"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weiss|first1=Michael|title=Jared Kushner Tempted by Russia's Bank of Spies|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/03/28/jared-kushner-tempted-by-russia-s-bank-of-spies|accessdate=26 May 2017|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; following approval of [[Ministry of Finance (Russia)|Minister of Finance]] [[Anton Siluanov]].&lt;ref name="rbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fp"/&gt;

In July 2014, Vnesheconombank was [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|slapped with sanctions]] by the European Union and the United States over the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russian invasion of Ukraine]]; however, Gorkov has said that the bank is aggressively pursuing business in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=«Проектов больше, чем денег»: глава ВЭБа Сергей Горьков о китайских кредитах в 2017 году|url=https://russian.rt.com/business/article/353245-veb-kredit-kitai|accessdate=25 May 2017|publisher=RT|date=25 January 2017|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank is also pursuing deals in the [[Persian Gulf]] and Islamic world. In 2016, Gorkov announced VEB would partner with the [[Islamic Development Bank]] in [[Saudi Arabia]], a financing conglomerate of 56 Islamic countries,&lt;ref name="vesti"&gt;{{cite news|title=Три основных направления стратегии ВЭБа|url=http://www.vestifinance.ru/articles/73171|accessdate=30 May 2017|work=Vesti Finance|date=21 July 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia’s VEB planning first deals with Islamic Development Bank|url=http://tass.com/economy/877158|accessdate=30 May 2017|agency=TASS|date=20 May 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an initial pilot project of $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia’s VEB considers $100 mln pilot deal with Islamic Development Bank|url=http://tass.com/economy/893641|accessdate=30 May 2017|agency=TASS|date=10 August 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meeting with Jared Kushner===

In 2017, Gorkov drew significant attention in Western media over his December 2016 meeting with [[Jared Kushner]], son-in-law and top adviser to then president-elect [[Donald Trump]]. In March 2017, [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Sean Spicer]] stated that Kushner met with Gorkov briefly as part of his role in the transition and as a diplomatic conduit to the [[United States Department of State|State Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pavia|first1=Will|title=Kushner's Kremlin connection focus|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/the-times/jared-kushner-named-as-person-of-interest-in-russia-probe/news-story/bd81a5a645f7138c6ad8f30fbffe5d80|accessdate=26 May 2017|work=The Australian|date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, VEB issued a statement that said Gorkov met with Kushner on a private matter concerning his family's real estate corporation, [[Kushner Companies]], even though VEB has been under [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis#Third|international sanctions since July 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dilanian|first1=Ken|last2=Alexander|first2=Peter|last3=Kube|first3=Courtney|title=Jared Kushner under FBI scrutiny in Russia probe, say officials|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jared-kushner-now-under-fbi-scrutiny-russia-probe-say-officials-n764826|accessdate=26 May 2017|publisher=NBC News|date=25 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement, issued to [[Reuters]], said that Gorkov met "with a number of representatives of the largest banks and business establishments of the United States, including Jared Kushner, the head of Kushner Companies."&lt;ref name="dailybeast"/&gt; According to multiple reports, Kushner is looking for investors in his project at [[666 Fifth Avenue]], which Kushner Companies bought for a record $1.8 billion in January 2007 prior to the recession.&lt;ref name="nytimes317"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frank|first1=Thomas|last2=Cohen|first2=Marshall|title=Russian banker who met Kushner has Putin ties|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/27/politics/kushner-meeting-russian-banker-tied-to-putin/|accessdate=26 May 2017|publisher=CNN|date=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dilanian|first1=Ken|last2=Caldwell|first2=Leigh Ann|last3=Siemaszko|first3=Corky|title=Was Kushner seeking a Russian bailout for his Manhattan building?

According to ''The Washington Post'', a VEB private jet associated with Gorkov's travel flew from Moscow to [[Newark, New Jersey]] on 13 December, and then departed 14 December to fly to Japan, where Putin was visiting for two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Filipov|first1=David|last2=Brittain|first2=Amy|last3=Helderman|first3=Rosalind S.|last4=Hamburger|first4=Tom|title=Explanations for Kushner’s meeting with head of Kremlin-linked bank don't match up|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/explanations-for-kushners-meeting-with-head-of-kremlin-linked-bank-dont-match-up/2017/06/01/dd1bdbb0-460a-11e7-bcde-624ad94170ab_story.html|accessdate=2 June 2017|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Jennifer|title=Donald Trump's Russia problems are getting worse|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2017/06/02/trumps-russia-problems-are-getting-worse/|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 May 2017, it was reported that Kushner was being investigated for his meetings with Gorkov and Russian ambassador to the United States [[Sergey Kislyak]], meetings which Kushner omitted on his form about foreign contacts when applying for security clearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zapotosky|first1=Matt|last2=Horwitz|first2=Sari|last3=Barrett|first3=Devlin|last4=Entous|first4=Adam|title=Jared Kushner now a focus in Russia investigation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/jared-kushner-now-a-focus-in-russia-investigation/2017/05/25/f078db74-40c7-11e7-8c25-44d09ff5a4a8_story.html|accessdate=26 May 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes529"/&gt; Gorkov's status as an FSB alumnus has led to media scrutiny of his past, especially as VEB acted as a cover for convicted Russian spy [[Evgeny Buryakov|Yevgeny Buryakov]], who was deported from the U.S. in March after serving 30 months in federal prison. [[CNN]] also noted that when Donald Trump brought the [[Miss Universe]] Pageant to Moscow in [[Miss Universe 2013|2013]], its biggest sponsor was Sberbank, led by Gorkov at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Griffin|first=Drew|authorlink=Drew Griffin|title=Who is the Russian banker who met with Kushner?|url=http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2017/05/31/russian-banker-sergey-gorkov-jared-kushner-the-lead-drew-griffin.cnn|accessdate=31 May 2017|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional roles===
Gorkov also sits on the board of directors for several companies, including Sberbank and Denizbank, the Russian aircraft industry's [[United Aircraft Corporation]], and the Agency for Strategic Initiatives, a state-run project that encourages young Russians to turn their ideas into businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Глава Внешэкономбанка Сергей Горьков вошел в совет директоров ОАК|url=https://rns.online/transport/Glava-Vneshekonombanka-Sergei-Gorkov-voshel-v-sovet-direktorov-OaK--2016-06-28/|accessdate=31 May 2017|agency= [[Rambler (portal)|Rambler]]|date=28 June 2016|language=ru-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sergey Gorkov, Vnesheconombank: Profile &amp; Biography|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/people/17218174-sergey-n-gorkov|accessdate=31 May 2017|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed '''Shareholder Protection Act'''&lt;ref name="hr4790"&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4790}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] that was introduced to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2010. It would amend the [[Securities Exchange Act]] of 1934 to require that any solicitation of a proxy, consent, or authorization with respect to any security of an issuer: (1) describe the specific nature and total amount of expenditures proposed for political activities for the forthcoming fiscal year; and (2) provide for a separate shareholder vote to authorize such proposed expenditures. The bill was introduced by [[Michael Capuano|Representative Michael Capuano]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Massachusetts]], partially as a response to the Supreme Court's ruling in [[Citizens United v.

'''Tan Chay Yan''' ({{zh|c=陳齊賢|p=Chén Qíxián}}; 1870 - 6 March 1916) was a rubber plantation merchant and [[philanthropist]]. A [[Peranakan]], Tan is the grandson of philanthropist [[Tan Tock Seng]] by his father, [[Tan Teck Guan]].&lt;ref name="SAPCD"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leo Suryadinata|title=Southeast Asian Personalities of Chinese Descent: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume I &amp; II|year=2012|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=981-4345-21-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tan was noted in [[Malayan history]] as the first man to plant rubber on a commercial basis, after he was introduced to rubber planting by [[Henry Nicholas Ridley]]. Subsequently, Tan started a {{convert|22|acre|m2|sing=on}} rubber estate at Bukit Lintang. He then ventured his rubber plantation business into [[Sri Lanka]]. According to his family, Tan's rubber plantation still belonged to the family.

As a philanthropist, Tan also gave [[Straits dollar|$]]15,000 towards the setting up of a medical college in Singapore. The donation went towards the construction of the [[Tan Teck Guan Building]], which Tan named in memory of his late father. Tan also served as a Municipal Councillor and a Trustee of the [[Cheng Hoon Teng]] Temple.

There is a variety of orchid named Vanda Tan Chay Yan, according to one of the Peranakan Cina Melaka's annual dinner souvenir books, but there is no record of who named it such. The Vanda Tan Chay Yan was named by his son [[Robert Tan Hoon Siang]] who personally developed the hybrid. A road in Melaka was also named after him in view of his contributions to the country's revenue.

Tan died of malaria at the age of 46. A relative believed he could have caught it as he often spent the long hours spent at the rubber plantations. Tan left behind his wife, Chua Wan Neo, a tenth generation Nyonya, six daughters and a son.

For memorizing his contributions, there is a road called ''Chay Yan Street'' as named after him in [[Tiong Bahru]], [[Singapore]].

'''Theodore P. Angelopoulos''' (born 1943) is a Greek shipping and steel magnate.

==Early life==
Theodore Angelopoulos was born in Athens, and lived in Switzerland for many years, where he received a BSc in Business Administration from the [[University of Zurich]]. His family were pioneers in the Greek steel industry and began dealing in the dry cargo sector of the shipping industry in the early 1950s.&lt;ref name="greeknewsonline1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.greeknewsonline.com/gianna-and-theodore-angelopoulos-to-receive-lead100-award-for-excellence/ |title=Gianna and Theodore Angelopoulos to Receive Lead100 Award for Excellence &amp;#124; Greek News |publisher=Greeknewsonline.com |date=2011-03-29 |accessdate=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Angelopoulos built an internationally based group of companies with interests in shipping and steel, and with investments in real estate and private equities, as well as other financial entities worldwide.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In 1996, he established Metrostar Management in Athens, and entered the oil tanker market in the same year, with his company going on to become one of the world's leading oil tanker operators. In 2002, he took control of the Dutch shipbuilding company oceAnco and he re-established it as a leading shipbuilder of custom-built luxury mega-yachts.&lt;ref name="greeknewsonline1"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Angelopoulos is married to [[Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki]].&lt;ref name="greeknewsonline1"/&gt;

His two nephews, [[Panagiotis Angelopoulos]] and [[Giorgos Angelopoulos]] are also in shipping, and steel.

In 1990, Angelopoulos bought the [[56 Old Church Street|Old Rectory]] in Chelsea, for some years London's largest and most expensive residential property, and probably the first in London to sell for more than £10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Julia Kollewe |author2=Rupert Neate |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/01/london-property-stable-investment-europeans |title=London property offers stable investment for wealthy Europeans &amp;#124; UK news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, he had the 82 metre yacht Alfa Nero built. In 2011, Alfa Nero was up for sale with an asking price of US$115 million, and it was bought by the Russian billionaire [[Andrey Guryev]].&lt;ref name="superyachtfan1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.superyachtfan.com/superyacht/superyacht_alfa_nero.html |title=SuperYacht Alfa Nero - Andrey Guryev - PhosAgro |publisher=Superyachtfan.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, he owns a new 66 metre yacht, called ''Okto''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="superyachtfan1"/&gt;

[[File:Václav Klement.jpg|thumb|Václav Klement]]

'''Václav Klement''' (October 16, 1868, [[Velvary]] – August 10, 1938, [[Mladá Boleslav]]) was a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Automobile|automotive]] pioneer, co-founder of [[Laurin &amp; Klement]], what is now [[Škoda Auto]]. He was a bookseller originally.

His childhood was not the happiest one. His mother died when he was small, replaced by a stepmother who hardly paid any attention to the little boy. From the age of 14 Klement did manual jobs although he showed talent for studying. Despite the obstacles he managed to become a good student and became an apprentice in a bookshop in the town of Slaný where he managed to finish his secondary studies.

After that Klement worked in Prague for some time and then moved to [[Mladá Boleslav]] where he worked in another bookshop. When the owner of the bookshop died Klement decided to buy it. However the business did not prosper and Klement had to sell the bookshop to pay off his debts.

The story of founding the Laurin &amp; Klement Company starts with the day when Klement bought a bicycle made by the German company [[Seidel &amp; Naumann]]. Upon finding a problem with the bicycle Klement sent a letter in the Czech language to the company, requesting repair. 
The company replied that they would deal with the request only if the letter were written in a "comprehensible" language. Klement was so indignant that he decided together with [[Václav Laurin]], to start repairing bicycles themselves.

Later in 1895, propelled by Klement's modesty, excellent people skills and business acumen, together with Laurin's technical expertise, the two decided to found the Laurin &amp; Klement Company, producing their own bicycles. These were known as Slavia bicycles. The company took off, and soon had 12 employees, later going up to 40.

In 1899 they went on to produce motorcycles which were an immediate success not only at home but also abroad, even in sport competitions. In 1902 Laurin &amp; Klement motorcycles were successful in the famous Paris - Vienna race. This race covered 1430&amp;nbsp;km and the only motorcycles that made it to the finish line without any breakdowns in 31 hours were the Laurin &amp; Klement motorcycles.

Soon these motorcycles became so successful that the company  decided to stop bicycle production in order to devote itself fully to motorcycles.
In 1903 the company had already about 200 employees producing around 2000 motorcycles annually.

In 1905 the company started making cars and in 1907 it expanded, registered on the stock exchange, and stopped motorcycle production. 
In 1925 the Laurin &amp; Klement Company joined the Pilsner Škoda Concern and the name of the factory was changed to Laurin &amp; Klement - Škoda, later only Škoda which produced hugely successful automobiles and became one of the great brand names, recognized worldwide, in the history of the Czech Republic. Václav Laurin kept the position of technical director. In 1991 the Škoda Factory became a member of the Volkswagen Group.
