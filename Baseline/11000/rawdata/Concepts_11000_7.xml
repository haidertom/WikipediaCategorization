'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to Public Information in [[Bulgaria]] is a right guaranteed by the 1991 Constitution. It is regulated by the '''Access to Public Information Act''' first introduced in 2000 and amended in December 2015. The amendments enhanced [[proactive disclosure]], encouraged electronic requests and facilitate re-use of information, in line with [[Directive 2013/37/EU on the Re-Use of Public Sector Information]].

==Background==

In 2014, a public consultation on the amendments to be introduced in the access to information legislation was initiated. In the Summer of 2014, a working group was set up at the Ministry of Transport Information Technologies and Communications with the mandate of drafting amendments to the Bulgarian legislation regarding the introduction of the revised Directive 2013/37/EU on the Re-use of Public Sector Information of the [[European Parliament]] and the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] of 26 June 2013. The amended Directive enlarged the scope of the re-use of public sector information by including archives, libraries and museums.&lt;ref name=AIP&gt;{{cite book|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=2015 |title=Access to public information in Bulgaria 2014 |url=http://store.aip-bg.org/publications/ann_rep_eng/2014.pdf |location=Sofia|publisher=Access to Information Programme |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative of amending the Bulgarian law on access to public information was also prepared in the framework of drafting and discussing the National Plan under the [[Open Government Partnership]] initiative.&lt;ref name=AIP/&gt;

In November 2015, the Bulgarian National Assembly adopted amendments to the Access to Public Information Act to enhance proactive disclosure, encourage electronic requests and facilitate re-use of information.&lt;ref name=Freedominfo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2015/12/bulgarian-assembly-amends-access-to-information-act/ |title=Bulgarian Assembly Amends Access to Information Act  |last= |first= |date=16 December 2015 |website=Freedominfo.org |publisher=Freedominfo.org. The global network of freedom of information advocates |access-date=8 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Professor Georgi Lozanov, a former member of the Council for Electronic Media, the introduction of the Access to Information Law could help in making more transparent the media sector, in particular [[transparency of media ownership in Bulgaria|media ownership]] and sources of funds which are largely opaque in Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www3.mirovni-institut.si/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/media-ownership-and-its-impact-on-media-independence-and-pluralism.pdf|title=Media Ownership and its Impact on Media Independence and Pluralism|last=Petković|first=Brankica|publisher=Peace Institute, Institute for Contemporary Social and Political Studies|year=2004|isbn=961-6455-26-5|location=Ljubljana,|pages=94|chapter=Bulgaria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal Framework==

===Constitution===
Article 41 of the Bulgarian Constitution of 1991 states that everyone shall be entitled to seek, receive and impart information, provided that this right shall not be exercised to the detriment of national security, public order, public health and morality. Article 41 entitles citizens to obtain information from state bodies and agencies on any matter of legitimate public interest which is not a state or other secret prescribed by law and does not affect the rights of other.&lt;ref name=Freedominfo2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedominfo.org/regions/europe/bulgaria/bulgaria/  |title=Bulgaria: Freedom of Information. Overview |last= |first= |date=16 December 2015 |website=Freedominfo.org |publisher=Freedominfo.org. The global network of freedom of information advocates |access-date=8 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to Public Information Act===
In Bulgaria access to public information is regulated by the '''Access to Public Information Act''' enacted in 2000, and amended in 2008 and 2015.&lt;ref name=Freedominfo2/&gt; The Law entitles any person or legal entity to the right of access to public information in any form held by state institutions and other entities financed by state budget and exercising public functions.&lt;ref name=Freedominfo2/&gt;

===2015 amendments to the law regulating access to public information===
The amended legal framework on access to public information introduced an extended the list of categories of information which are subject to [[proactive disclosure]]. Also, amendments introduced an explicit duty to publish any information that have been provided on requests more than three times, along with a broader obligation to publish online information of public interest.&lt;ref name=Freedominfo/&gt;

The amendments also aimed at encouraging the submission of electronic requests, which can be sent with no need of electronic signature.&lt;ref name=Freedominfo/&gt;

Another novelty concerns the presumption of third-party consent, meaning that if a public authority asks for a third-party consent for the disclosure of requested information affecting it, the lack of response within 14 days will be presumed as consent and the information should be completely provided, Thanks to the amendment, thus, the requested information is not considered, as it was before the amendment, a dissent by the third party which obliged the public body to provide only partial access.&lt;ref name=Freedominfo/&gt;

The amendments also introduced the Directive 2013/37/UE, revising the first [[Directive on the re-use of public sector information|Directive on the Re-Use of Public Sector Information]] (2003) which was transposed in 2007 in the access to Public Information Act. In line with the revised directive, the amended law extended the re-use regime by prohibiting any exclusive clauses in giving rights to use whole databases coherently with the Directive provision that obliges any public body in the EU to provide equal availability of such databases on equal conditions and with costs for accessing calculated in transparent way.&lt;ref name=Freedominfo/&gt;

The new legal framework adopts a broader definition of the "public law organizations" that are subject to both access to information requests and information re-use. Libraries, museums and archives have been included among the institutions that have to disclose information for re-use. According to the amended law, public sector bodies are obliged to make their documents available in a user-friendly manner and in open and machine-readable format, together with their metadata in a government [[Open Data Portal]].&lt;ref name=Freedominfo/&gt;

==Main provisions under the Access to Information Law==

Under the Bulgarian law on Access to Public Information, all state bodies, including their directorates/regional/local offices/territorial units, etc. are subject to access to information. Also, the law applies to local government authorities, including mayors and municipal councils. Moreover, other entities are subject to the access to information law, in particular all authorities which perform public functions prescribed by the law, named "public law entities", for instance the Electronic Media Council, the National Health Insurance Fund and the like, and individuals and legal entities financed with funds from the state budget or the [[European Union]] (both subsidies and EU projects and programmes).&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aip-bg.org/en/cases/FAQ/  |title=Frequently Asked Questions |last= |first= |date= |website=Aip-bg.bg |publisher=Access to Information Programme |access-date=8 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law applies to any information generated or held by state authorities, local authorities and other entities obliged under the law. The right of access to public information is restricted in case of information:

* which are classified as state or official secrete;
* which relates to negotiations and to the preparatory work of an act;
* which affects third party's interests (trade secret and personal data);
* which access has been granted to the requester within the preceding six months.

However, according to the law, even if there is a reason for refusal, information shall be disclosed if there is an overriding public interest which disclosure contributes to enhance.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;

Information requests may be submitted either orally or in written form. According to the law, each authority is obliged to appoint  for its office an official with the responsibility of handling the requests.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;

In line with international best practices, access to information in Bulgaria is free of charge. Paying a fee can only be required to cover the actual costs of reproducing the document (copies, prints, etc.)&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;

Under the Bulgarian law, in case requesters do not receive the information sought they may appeal to the court.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; The law does not establish an institution in charge of overseeing the implementation of the law in access to public information.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==

According to a study conducted by the NGO Access to Information Program (AIP) in 2015, every third institution in Bulgaria does not make public its regulatory acts and half of them do not do this with regard to the general administrative acts. Among the institutions which fail to publish their regulatory acts there are the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and many municipalities.&lt;ref name=OBCT&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/Bulgaria/Bulgaria-every-third-institution-is-not-trasparent-177497 |title=Bulgaria: every third institution is not transparent|last=Yordanova|first=Tsvetelina |date=9 February 2017 |website=Balcanicaucaso.org |publisher=Osservatorio Balcani Caucaso Transeuropa |access-date=9 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study also finds out there is a bit more transparency in relation to the publication of databases and registers. The same holds good for the publication of programs and strategic documents, such as development strategies, and the like.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;

As for financial transparency, the report acknowledges an improvement since 2013, but still about half of the institutions do not publish their budgets on the Internet as required by the law.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;A good level of transparency has been registered on disclosure of information for public procurement tenders: 94% of institutions scrutinized by the AIP has a dedicated section on their websites.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;

The report found out that Bulgarian institutions do not comply with the new requirements of the Access to Public Information Act when it establishes that they are obliged to publish the information that they have provided to citizens more than three times on the grouds of freedom of information applications.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt; According to the AIP survey, only 4% out of 565 institutions scrutinized had complied with this requirement at the time the survey was conducted during 2015.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt; However, almost all institutions, around 97%, complied with the new requirement that introduced electronic applications for freedom of information requests.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;

The 2015 AIP survey revealed that the Ministry of Education and Science is the most transparent ministry in Bulgaria, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the least transparent.&lt;ref name=OBCT/&gt;

'''Animal studies''' is a recently recognized field in which animals are studied in a variety of cross-disciplinary ways. Scholars who engage in animal studies may be formally trained in a number of diverse fields, including [[geography]], [[art history]], [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[film studies]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[psychology]], [[literary studies]], [[museology]], [[philosophy]], communication, and [[sociology]]. They may engage with questions about literal animals, or about notions of "animality" or "brutality," employing various theoretical perspectives, including [[feminism]], [[Marxist theory]], and [[queer theory]]. Using these perspectives, those who engage in animal studies seek to understand both human-animal relations now and in the past, and to understand animals as beings-in-themselves, separate from our knowledge of them. Because the field is still developing, scholars and others have some freedom to define their own criteria about what issues may structure the field.

==History==
As an interdisciplinary subject, animal studies exists at the intersection of a number of different fields of study. Different fields began to turn to animals as an important topic at different times and for various reasons, and these separate disciplinary histories shape how scholars approach animal studies.

In part, animal studies developed out of the [[animal liberation movement]] and was grounded in [[ethics|ethical]] questions about co-existence with other species: whether it is moral to eat animals, to do scientific research on animals for human benefit, and so on. Animal studies scholars who explore the field from an ethical perspective frequently cite [[Australian]] philosopher [[Peter Singer]]'s 1975 work, ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'',&lt;ref name="Gorman"&gt;{{cite web |author=Gorman, James |date=12 January 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/science/animal-studies-move-from-the-lab-to-the-lecture-hall.html?pagewanted=all |title=Animal Studies Move From the Lab to the Lecture Hall |publisher=The New York Times |access-date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a founding document in animal studies.  Singer's work followed [[Jeremy Bentham#Animal rights|Jeremy Bentham]]'s by trying to expand [[utilitarian]] questions about pleasure and pain beyond humans to other [[sentience|sentient]] creatures.

Theorists interested in the role of animals in literature, culture, and [[Continental philosophy]] also consider the late work of [[Jacques Derrida]] a driving force behind the rise of interest in animal studies in the humanities.&lt;ref name="Gorman" /&gt;  Derrida's final lecture series, ''The Animal That Therefore I Am'', examined how interactions with animal life affect human attempts to define humanity and the self through language. Taking up Derrida's deconstruction and extending it to other cultural territory, [[Cary Wolfe]] published ''Animal Rites'' in 2003 and critiqued earlier animal rights philosophers such as [[Peter Singer]] and Thomas Regan. Wolfe's study points out an insidious humanism at play in their philosophies and others. Recently also the Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] published a book on the question of the animal: ''The Open. Man and Animal''.

==Research topics and methodologies==
Researchers in animal studies examine the questions and issues that arise when traditional modes of [[Humanities|humanistic]] and [[Science|scientific]] inquiry begin to take animals seriously as subjects of thought and activity.  Students of animal studies may examine how humanity is defined in relation to animals, or how representations of animals create understandings (and misunderstandings) of other species. In order to do so, animal studies pays close attention to the ways that humans [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] animals, and asks how humans might avoid bias in observing other creatures. For instance, [[Donna Haraway]]'s book, ''Primate Visions'', examines how [[diorama]]s created for the [[American Museum of Natural History]] showed family groupings that conformed to the traditional human [[nuclear family]], which misrepresented the animals' observed behavior in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Donna |last=Haraway |authorlink=Donna_Haraway |jstor=466593 |title=Teddy Bear Patriarchy: Taxidermy in the Garden of Eden, New York City, 1908–1936 |journal=Social Text |issue=11 |date=Winter 1984–1985 |pages=20–64 |publisher=Duke University Press |doi = 10.2307/466593}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical approaches in animal studies have also considered representations of non-human animals in popular culture, including species diversity in animated films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Becoming-Animal Is A Trap For Humans |first=Timothy |last=Laurie |journal=Deleuze and the Non-Human |year=2015 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912960}}, eds. Hannah Stark and Jon Roffe.&lt;/ref&gt;

By highlighting these issues, animal studies strives to re-examine traditional [[Ethics|ethical]], [[Politics|political]], and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] categories in the context of a renewed attention to and respect for animal life. The assumption that focusing on animals might clarify human knowledge is neatly expressed in [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s famous dictum that animals are "good to think."&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. ''Totemism''. Boston: Beacon Press, 1963, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Automath''' ("automating mathematics") was a [[formal language]], devised by [[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn]] starting in 1967, for expressing complete mathematical theories in such a way that an included automated [[proof checker]] can verify their correctness.

==Overview==
The Automath system included many novel notions that were later adopted and/or reinvented in areas such as [[typed lambda calculus]] and [[explicit substitution]]. [[Dependent types]] is one outstanding example. Automath was also the first practical system that exploited the [[Curry&amp;ndash;Howard correspondence]]. Propositions were represented as sets (called "categories") of their proofs, and the question of provability became a question of non-emptiness ([[type inhabitation]]); de Bruijn was unaware of Howard's work, and stated the correspondence independently.&lt;ref&gt;Morten Heine Sørensen, Paweł Urzyczyn, ''Lectures on the Curry&amp;ndash;Howard isomorphism'', Elsevier, 2006, {{ISBN|0-444-52077-5}}, pp 98-99&lt;/ref&gt;  

L. S. van Benthem Jutting, as part of this Ph.D. thesis in 1976, translated [[Edmund Landau]]'s ''Foundations of Analysis'' into Automath and checked its correctness.
 
Automath was never widely publicized at the time, however, and so never achieved widespread use; nonetheless, it proved very influential in the later development of [[logical framework]]s and [[proof assistant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;R. P. Nederpelt, J. H. Geuvers, R. C. de Vrijer (1994) ''Selected Papers on Automath.'' Vol. 133 of Studies Logic, Elsevier, Amsterdam. {{ISBN|0-444-89822-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. Kamareddine (2003) ''Thirty-five years of automating mathematics.'' Workshop, Dordrecht, Boston, published by Kluwer Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|1-4020-1656-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mizar system]], a system of writing and checking formalized mathematics that is still in active use, was influenced by Automath.

'''Buy Nothing Day''' ('''BND''') is an international day of protest against [[consumerism]]. In North America, the United Kingdom, Finland and Sweden, Buy Nothing Day is held the day after U.S. [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], concurrent to [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]]; elsewhere, it is held the following day, which is the last Saturday in November.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2000"&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/internetnews/story/0,7369,402170,00.html Buy Nothing Day]"''The Guardian.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adbusters BND"&gt;"[http://abillionpeople.org/buy-nothing-day/ Buy Nothing Day]"''Adbusters.org''&lt;/ref&gt; Buy Nothing Day was founded in [[Vancouver]] by artist Ted Dave&lt;ref&gt;Crook, Barbara. "Can you say bye to buying 1 day a year?" ''[[Vancouver Sun]]''. September 25, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently promoted by ''[[Adbusters]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2000/11/40142 Click Here to Buy Nothing]. Joanna Glasner. [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']], November 22, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; based in Canada.

The first Buy Nothing Day was organized in Canada in September 1992 "as a day for society to examine the issue of overconsumption." In 1997, it was moved to the Friday after American Thanksgiving, also called [[Black Friday (shopping)|"Black Friday"]], which is one of the ten busiest shopping days in the United States. In 2000, some advertisements by ''Adbusters'' promoting Buy Nothing Day were denied advertising time by almost all major television networks except for [[CNN]].&lt;ref name="Guardian 2000"/&gt; Soon, campaigns started appearing in the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Austria, Germany, New Zealand, Japan, the Netherlands, France, Norway and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enkopfridag.se/1998.php|title=1998, köp-inget-dagen|publisher=En köpfri dag|language=Swedish|author=Jonas Lindkvist|date=1998|accessdate=August 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation now includes more than 65 nations.

==Activities==
[[File:Buy Nothing Day trolley (cropped).jpg|thumb|A Buy Nothing Day sign attached to a Walmart shopping trolley by an activist]]
Various gatherings and forms of protest have been used on Buy Nothing Day to draw attention to the problem of [[overconsumption]]:
* Credit card cut-up: Participants stand in a shopping mall, shopping center, or store with a pair of scissors and a poster that advertises help for people who want to put an end to mounting debt and extortionate interest rates with one simple cut. Namely, by destroying their credit card by cutting it with the scissors.
* Free, non-commercial street parties
* [[Sit-in]]
* [[Zombie walk]]: Participant "zombies" wander around shopping malls or other consumer havens with a blank stare. When asked what they are doing, participants describe Buy Nothing Day.
* Whirl-mart: Participants silently steer their shopping carts around a shopping mall or store in a long, baffling conga line without putting anything in the carts or actually making any purchases.
* Public protests
* Wildcat General Strike: A strategy used for the 2009 Buy Nothing Day where participants not only do not buy anything for twenty-four hours but also keep their lights, televisions, computers and other non-essential appliances turned off, their cars parked, and their phones turned off or unplugged from sunrise to sunset.&lt;ref name="Adbusters BND"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2013}}
* Buy Nothing Day hike: Rather than celebrating consumerism by shopping, participants celebrate The Earth and nature.
* Buy Nothing + [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]]: As the monthly Critical Mass bicycle ride often falls on this day or near, rides in some cities acknowledge and celebrate Buy Nothing Day.
* Buy Nothing Day paddle along the San Francisco waterfront: This event is promoted by the Bay Area Sea Kayakers to kayak along the notoriously consumptive San Francisco waterfront.
* The Buy Nothing Coat Exchange: began in Rhode Island and became part of the Buy Nothing Day some twenty years ago. Coupling the two events was the brainchild of Greg Gerritt, an expert in environmental studies and long term activist in consumerism and global warming. Similar Winter Coat Exchanges take place on Buy Nothing Day in Kentucky, Utah and Oregon. Coats are collected throughout the month of November from anyone who wants to donate and brought to various locations within each state. On the day after Thanksgiving, many opt out of the Black Friday madness to donate and/or volunteer. On that day, anyone who needs a winter coat is welcome to exchange one or just take one. The lines in Providence RI form early and are long which punctuates the need that is prevalent in many cities and towns. The combination of the two events has become a welcomed tradition in RI.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

==Criticism==
While critics of the day charge that Buy Nothing Day simply causes participants to buy the next day,&lt;ref&gt;[https://thetyee.ca/Views/2006/11/24/BND/ Why I Shop on Buy Nothing Day], TheTyee.ca, November 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Adbusters states that it "isn't just about changing your habits for one day" but "about starting a lasting lifestyle commitment to consuming less and producing less [[waste]]."{{cite quote|date=November 2018}}

Other campaigns, such as Shift Your Shopping, attempt to redirect spending away from corporate chains and online giants toward locally owned, community-based businesses as a means to combat consumerism. Even some independent business advocates, such as the [[American Independent Business Alliance]], recognize "Black Friday" frenzy does little for independent businesses and instead encourage people to consider giving gifts but not necessarily "things".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Gifts Don't Have to Be "Stuff"|url=http://www.amiba.net/news/2011/great-gifts-not-stuff|publisher=American Independent Business Alliance|archivedate=October 17, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017183448/http://www.amiba.net/news/2011/great-gifts-not-stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaming==
[[Adbusters]] in 2011 renamed the event Occupy Xmas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://occupyxmas.net/ Occupy Xmas], {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231142336/http://www.occupyxmas.net/ |date=December 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the [[Occupy movement]].  Buy Nothing Day was first joined with Adbuster's [[Buy Nothing Christmas]] campaign.  Shortly thereafter, Lauren Bercovitch, the production manager at Adbusters Media Foundation publicly embraced the principles of Occupy Xmas, advocating "something as simple as buying locally—going out and putting money into your local economy—or making your Christmas presents".&lt;ref&gt;[https://thefulcrum.ca/news/an-occupied-christmas/ An interview with Lauren Bercovitch]&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the central message of Occupy X-mas and Occupy Christmas differed in that Occupy X-Mas called for a "buy nothing Christmas" and Occupy Christmas called for support of local economy, artists, and craftspeople in holiday shopping.  The union of these ideologies calls for a Buy Nothing Day to kick off a season of supporting local economy and family.

'''''Chokmâh''''' ({{lang|he|[[:wikt:חכמה|חָכְמָה]]}} ,חכמה [[ISO 259]] {{transl|he|ḥoḵma}} or ''khok-maw''') is the [[Biblical Hebrew]] word rendered as "[[wisdom]]" in English Bible versions ([[LXX]] {{lang|grc|σοφία}} ''[[sophia (wisdom)|sophia]]'', [[Vulgate]] ''{{lang|la|sapientia}}'').&lt;ref name=Strong&gt;''[[Strong's Concordance]]'' [https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H2451&amp;t=KJV H2451]:
"from H2449 [חָכַם ''chakam'' "wise"]; wisdom (in a good sense):—skilful, wisdom, wisely, wit."
"The KJV translates Strong's H2451 in the following manner: wisdom (145x), wisely (2x), skilful man (1x), wits (1x)."&lt;/ref&gt;

The word occurs 149 times in the [[Masoretic text]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]]&lt;ref name="Strong" /&gt;
The Talmud ([[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 31a) describes knowledge of the Talmudic order of [[Kodshim]] as a high level of wisdom, ''chokhmah''.

It is [[cognate]] with the Arabic word for "wisdom", ''[[ḥikma]]'' {{lang|ar|حكمة}} ([[Semitic root]] {{lang|sem|ḥ-k-m}}). 
Adjectival {{transl|he|[[hakham|ḥaḵam]]}} "wise" is used as a honorific, as in ''[[Talmid Chacham]]'' (lit. "student of a sage") for a  [[Torah study|Torah scholar]], or ''[[hakham Bashi]]'' for a [[chief rabbi]].

In the [[Kabbalah]], ''Chokhmah'' is the uppermost of the [[sephirot]] of the right line (''kav yamin'', the "Pillar of Mercy") in the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. 
It is to the bottom right of [[Keter (Kabbalah)|Keter]], with [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]] across from it. Under it are the ''sephirot'' of [[Chesed (Kabbalah)|Chesed]] and [[Netzach (Kabbalah)|Netzach]]. It commonly has four paths going to Keter, Binah, [[Tiphereth (Kabbalah)|Tifereth]], and Chesed. (Some kabbalists{{Who|date=July 2010}} attribute a path between Chokhmah and [[Gevurah (Kabbalah)|Gevurah]].)

==Hebrew Bible==
{{see|Sophia (wisdom)}}
Proverbs personifies Divine Wisdom, which existed before the world was made, revealed God, and acted as God's agent in creation ({{bibleverse||Prov|8:22–31|KJV}} cf. 3:19; {{bibleverse||Wisdom|8:4-6|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Sir|1:4,9|KJV}}). Wisdom dwelt with God ({{bibleverse||Prov|8:22–31|KJV}}; cf. {{bibleverse||Sir|24:4|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Wisdom|9:9-10|KJV}}) and being the exclusive property of God was as such inaccessible to human beings ({{bibleverse||Job|28:12–13, 20–1, 23–27|KJV}}). It was God who "found" wisdom ({{bibleverse||Bar|3:29-37|KJV}}) and gave her to [[Israelites|Israel]]: "He hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob his servant, and to Israel his beloved. Afterward did he shew himself upon earth, and conversed with men." ({{bibleverse||Bar|3:36-37|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Sir|24:1-12|KJV}}). As a female figure (Sir. 1:15; Wis. 7:12), wisdom addressed human beings (Prov. 1:20–33; 8:1–9:6) inviting to her feast those who are not yet wise (Prov. 9:1-6). 
Wisdom 7:22b-8:1 is a famous passage describing Divine Wisdom, including the passage:
"For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore can no defiled thing fall into her. For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness. And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets." ({{bibleverse||Wisdom|7:25-27|KJV}}). 
[[Solomon]], as the archetypal wise person, fell in love with Wisdom: "I loved her, and sought her out from my youth, I desired to make her my spouse, and I was a lover of her beauty." ({{bibleverse||Wisdom|8:2|KJV}}).&lt;ref&gt;For a summary account of wisdom in the Hebrew Bible cf. R.E. Murphy, "Wisdom in the Old Testament", ''Anchor Bible Dictionary'' (1992), vi. 920–931.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kabbalah==
{{More footnotes|date=July 2010}}
According to the Bahir: "The second (utterance) is [[wisdom]], as is written: 'Y-H-W-H acquired me at the beginning of His way, before His deeds of old' (Prov 8:22). And there is no 'beginning' but wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Green. ''A Guide to the Zohar''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chokhmah, the second of the ten sefirot, is the first power of conscious intellect within Creation, and the first point of 'real' existence, since Keter represents emptiness. According to the book of Job, "Wisdom comes from nothingness".&lt;ref&gt;Job. 28:12&lt;/ref&gt; This point is both infinitely small, and yet encompasses the whole of being, but it remains incomprehensible until it is given shape and form in [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]].&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Moshe Cordovero. The Palm Tree of Devorah&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of God associated with Chokhmah is [[Yah (Yahweh)|Yah]].

Chokhmah  appears in the configuration of the ''sefirot'' at the top of the right axis, and corresponds in the ''tzelem Elokim'' ("the Divine image") to the right eye, or right hemisphere of the brain.

In its fully articulated form, Chokhmah  possesses two ''partzufim'' ("faces" or "features"): the higher of these is referred to as ''Abba Ila'ah'' ("the higher father"), whereas the lower is referred to as Yisrael Saba ("Israel, the Elder"). These two ''partzufim'' are referred to jointly as ''Abba'' ("father").

Chokhmah is associated in the soul with the power of intuitive insight, flashing lightning-like across consciousness. The ''partzuf'' of ''Abba Ila'ah'' is associated with the power to spontaneously extract such insight from the superconscious realm, whereas the ''partzuf'' of ''Yisrael Saba'' is associated with the power to subsequently direct it into consciousness.

The "wisdom" of Chokhmah also implies the ability to look deeply at some aspect of reality and abstract its conceptual essence till one succeeds in uncovering its underlying axiomatic truth. These seeds of truth can then be conveyed to the companion power of Binah for the sake of intellectual analysis and development.

Chokhmah is the primary ("beginning") force in the creative process, [[Creativity]], as it is said: "You have made them all with Chokhmah." (Psalms 104:24) The first word of the [[Torah]] in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], ''Breishit'' means "In the beginning (God created the heavens and the earth)", is translated (Targum Yonatan) as "With Chokhmah (God created…)."

Chokhmah is also called Fear, 'because it has no measure of boundary, and therefore the mind does not have the power to grasp it'.&lt;ref&gt;Aryeh Kaplan. Meditation and Kabbalah&lt;/ref&gt; The book of Job states 'Behold the fear of God is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding' (Job 28:28).

In the array of sefirot in three columns (''gimel kavim''), Chokmah is situated at the top of the right column, and corresponds to the right hemisphere of the [[brain]]. There are several aspects of Chokhmah:

The word Chokhmah itself may be broken into two words -- ''koach'' ("potential") and ''ma'' ("what is"). Thus, Chokhmah means "the potential of what is", or, "the potential to be." This aspect of Chokhmah describes the state of Chokhmah in relation to the sefira of Keter. As Chokhmah emanates from Keter, the first dawning of the "Infinite Light", it "appears" in an obscure and undefined state that is a virtual non-being. Thus the verse states, "and Chokhmah emerges from nothingness" (Job 28:12, see Zohar II, 121a, Zohar III, 290a, commentaries). The light of the [[Ein Sof (Kabbalah)|Ein Sof]] becomes unified in the world of ''[[Atziluth]]'' through clothing itself first in the sefira of Chokhmah. In the soul, Chokhmah is associated with the power of intuitive insight.

In the Zohar Chokhmah is the primordial point which shines forth from the will of God and thus, is the starting point of Creation. All things are still undifferentiated at this point and only become intelligible at Binah.

&lt;!--

The word Chokhmah  is read in the [[Zohar]] (Numbers 220b) as ''koach mah'', "the power of selflessness", or, alternatively, as ''cheich mah'', "the palate of selflessness."

"The power of selflessness" implies not only the attribute of selflessness itself, but the great creative power that selflessness entails.

"The palate of selflessness" is the soul's ability to "taste" Divinity by virtue of one's state of selflessness, as is said (Psalms 34:8): "Taste and see that God is good." In general, the sense of sight relates to Chokhmah  (the lightning-flash referred to above). From this verse we learn that there is an inner, spiritual sense of taste in Chokhmah  that precedes and arouses the sense of sight.

In Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]]'s commentary on the [[Bahir]] he says "Wisdom (Chokhmah) is therefore the first thing that the mind can grasp, and is therefore called a "beginning." and according to the [[Hasidic Judaism]] site Inner.org, Chokhmah refers to "the first power of conscious intellect within Creation."

==Qualities derived from Chokhmah==

===Ethical Behaviour===
Chokhmah has 2 faces, one facing keter above, and the other overseeing the over sefirot. Therefore, to emulate this Sefira, one aspect should be in communion with his Creator in order to increase his wisdom, and the other should be to teach others the wisdom that the Holy One has endowed him.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Moshe Cordovero. The Palm Tree of Devorah&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

==Modern occultism==
According to the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], the name of God associated with Chokmah is [[Jehovah]], the [[archangel]] that presides over it is [[Raziel]], the order of [[angel]]s that reside in it are the [[Ophanim]] (the wheels), the Heaven of [[Assiah]] associated with it is called Mazloth, implying the fulfillment of destiny, and the mundane chakra associated with it is the [[Zodiac]].

In [[Aleister Crowley]]'s ''[[Liber 777]]'', Chokhma is represented as The Four twos of the [[Tarot]], Illuminating, [[Thoth]], [[Vishnu]], [[Philosophy of happiness|Joy]], [[Odin]], [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], [[Athena]], [[God]] the Father, [[Man]], [[Amaranth]], [[Lingam]], [[Hashish]], [[Phosphorus]], [[Musk]], and [[yin and yang|Yang]] (not a complete list).

'''Cloud cuckoo land''' is a state of absurdly, [[Optimism|over-optimistic]] [[fantasy]] or an unrealistically [[Ideal (ethics)|idealistic]] state where everything is perfect. Someone who is said to "'''live in cloud cuckoo land'''" is a person who thinks that things that are completely impossible might happen, rather than understanding how things really are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/cloud-cuckoo-land|title=Cloud Cuckoo land|publisher=Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also hints that the person referred to is [[Naivety|naive]], unaware of realities or deranged in holding such an optimistic belief.

In the modern world, a "cloud cuckoo lander" is defined as someone who is seen as "crazy" or "strange" by most average people, often doing or saying things that seemingly only make sense to themselves, but also exhibit cleverness at times in ways no one else would think of.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander Cloudcuckoolander]. Retrieved 30 September 2017.{{Better source|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cockaigne]], the land of plenty in medieval myth, can be referred to as the modern day cloud cuckoo land. It was an imaginary place of extreme luxury and ease where physical comforts and pleasures were always immediately at hand and where the harshness of medieval peasant life did not exist.

==Literary sources==
[[Aristophanes]], a Greek playwright, wrote and directed a drama ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'', first performed in 414 BC, in which Pisthetaerus, a middle-aged Athenian persuades the world's birds to create a new city in the sky to be named ''Nubicuculia'' or Cloud Cuckoo Land&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cloud+cuckoo+land |title=listing of Cloud Cuckoo Land |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang|grc|Νεφελοκοκκυγία}}, ''{{transl|grc|Nephelokokkygia}}''), thereby gaining control over all communications between men and gods.  The German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] used the word (German ''{{lang|de|Wolkenkuckucksheim}}'') in his publication ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]'' in 1813,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/onthefourfoldroo00schouoft#page/132/mode/2up ''On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason''] § 34, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as later in his main work ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/theworldaswillan01schouoft#page/352/mode/2up ''The World as Will and Representation''] Vol. I, Part 4, § 53, p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt; and in other places. Here, he gave it its figurative sense by reproaching other philosophers for only talking about Cloud-cuckoo-land.  The German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] refers to the term in his essay "On Truth and Lying in a Nonmoral Sense."  Author [[Edward Crankshaw]] used the term when discussing the Deak-Andrassy Plan of 1867 in his 1963 book ''The Fall of the [[House of Habsburg]]'' (Chapter 13, "The Iron Ring of Fate").

==Uses in politics==
The phrase has been used by British and United State politicians as well as writers.  [[Margaret Thatcher]] famously used this phrase in the 1980s: "The [[African National Congress|ANC]] is [[Umkhonto we Sizwe#Military campaign|a typical terrorist organisation]]... Anyone who thinks it is going to run the [[government of South Africa|government in South Africa]] is living in cloud-cuckoo land."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/from-terrorist-to-tea-with-the-queen-1327902.html|title=Nelson Mandela: From 'terrorist' to tea with the Queen |publisher=The Independent |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bernard Ingham]], [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s spokesman, who, when asked if the [[ANC]] might overthrow the [[government of South Africa]] by force, replied: "It is cloud-cuckoo land for anyone to believe that could be done".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/aug/27/uk.conservatives1|title=Cameron: we got it wrong on apartheid|publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ann Widdecombe]], British MP used the phrase in a debate on [[drug prohibition]] with a representative of [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]]: "...it is cloud cuckoo land to suggest that [people who don't currently use heroin would not start using it if it became legal]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDjBHKZoQYM |title=Frost over the world - Drugs debate - 27 Mar 09 - Part 4 |publisher=You Tube |date= |accessdate=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Newt Gingrich]] referred to [[Barack Obama]]'s claim that [[algae]] could be [[algae fuel|used as a fuel source]] as cloud cuckoo land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/05/news/la-pn-gingrich-obama-algae-20120305|title=Gingrich mocks Obama's algae energy comments as 'Cloud Cuckoo Land' |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Henry A. Wallace]], U.S. Secretary of Agriculture  (later [[U.S. Vice President]] in [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s third term) used the term to describe the unrealistically inflated value of [[stocks]] on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] just before the [[crash of 1929]] that signaled the onset of the [[Great Depression]]. In his 1936 book, ''Whose Constitution? An Inquiry into the General Welfare'', Wallace describes a cartoon in a popular weekly magazine which "pictured an airplane in an endurance flight refueling in mid-air, and made fun of the old fashioned economist down below who was saying it couldn't be done. The economic aeroplane was to keep on gaining elevation indefinitely, with the millennium just around a cloud" (p.&amp;nbsp;75). Wallace wrote that Wall Street's practice of lending money to Europe after World War I "to pay interest on the [war reparations] debts she owed us and to buy the products we wanted to sell her ... was the international refueling device that for 12 years kept our economic aeroplane above the towering peaks of our credit structure and the massive wall of our tariff, in Cloud-Cuckoo Land".

[[Paul Krugman]] used the phrase referring to inadequate German economic politics toward failing members of the European Union: "Basically, it seems that even as the euro approaches a critical juncture, senior German officials are living in Wolkenkuckucksheim—cloud-cuckoo land." (June 9, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/09/wolkenkuckucksheim|title= Wolkenkuckucksheim |publisher=The New York Times |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yuri N. Maltsev, an Austrian economist and economic historian,&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/profile/yuri-n-maltsev Yuri N. Maltsev]. Mises Institute. Retrieved 30 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; uses the term to describe the lack of promised results in the communist states in his forward to 1920 essay by [[Ludwig von Mises]]: "Today, the disastrous consequences of enforcing the utopia on the unfortunate populations of the communist states are clear even to their leaders. As Mises predicted, despite the cloud-cuckoo lands of their fancy, roasted pigeons failed to fly into the mouths of the comrades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://mises.org/system/tdf/Economic%20Calculation%20in%20the%20Socialist%20Commonwealth_Vol_2_3.pdf?file=1&amp;type=document | title=Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth | publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute | year=2012 | orig-year=1990 | author=Ludwig von Mises | translator=S. Adler | isbn=978-1-61016-550-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The phrase has been used in poetry, music, film and by writers. ''Cloudcuckooland'', a poetry collection by [[Simon Armitage]]. [[Cloudcuckooland (album)|''Cloudcuckooland'']], the first album by [[the Lightning Seeds]], released in 1990. Cloud Cuckooland is the name of the eighth world found in the video game ''[[Banjo-Tooie]]''. Cloud Cuckoo Land is the name of a magical realm, hidden inside a cloud featured in ''[[The Lego Movie]]''.  [[Radiohead]] uses the term in the lyrics of their song [[Like Spinning Plates]]. Publisher and editor [[Gary Groth]] uses the term in the title of his review&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/the-comics-journal-no-232-april-2001/ |title=McCloud Cukoo-Land  |publisher=The Comics Journal |date= |accessdate=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Scott McCloud]]'s book [[Reinventing Comics]].

Cloud Cuckoo Land has been used as a stand-in for [[Hollywood]] as in [[Stella Gibbons]]'s ''[[Cold Comfort Farm]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5257">'''Conflict avoidance''' is a method of reacting to conflict, which attempts to avoid directly confronting the issue at hand. Methods of doing this can include changing the subject, putting off a discussion until later, or simply not bringing up the subject of contention. Conflict prevention  can be used as a temporary measure to buy time or as permanent means of disposing of a matter. The latter may be indistinguishable from simple acquiescence to the other party, to the extent that the person avoiding the conflict subordinates their own wishes to the party with whom they have the conflict. However, conflict prevention  can also take the form of withdrawing from the relationship. Thus, avoidance scenarios can be either win-lose, lose-lose or possibly even win-win, if terminating the relationship is the best method of solving the problem.

The term "conflict avoidance" is sometimes used to describe [[conflict prevention]]. Bacal criticizes this use of terms by asking, {{cquote|Is there a difference between preventing contracting AIDS by the use of appropriate precautions, and avoiding or not seeking treatment if one has contracted it? Of course there is.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.work911.com/conflict/carticles/conav.htm Is Conflict Prevention The Same As Conflict Avoidance?], Bacal.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Turner and Weed classify concealment as one of the three main types of responses to conflict, describing concealers as those who take no risk and so say nothing, concealing their views and feelings. Concealers are further divided into three types; namely:&lt;ref&gt;Conflict in organizations: Practical solutions any manager can use; Turner, Stephen P. (University of South Florida); Weed, Frank; 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Feeling-swallowers who swallow their feelings. They smile even if the situation is causing them pain and distress. They behave thus because they consider the approval of other people important and feel that it would be dangerous to affront them by revealing their true feelings.
*Subject-changers who find the real issue too difficult to handle. They change the topic by finding something on which there can be some agreement with the conflicting party. According to Turner and Weed, this response style usually does not solve the problem; instead, it can create problems for the people who use this and for the organization in which such people are working.
*Avoiders who go out of their way to avoid conflicts.

==Controversy==
The [[Thomas–Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument|Thomas-Kilmann grid]] views avoidance as a lose-lose proposition since it does not address the issue at hand. But other sources view avoidance as a useful means of disposing of  very minor, non-recurring conflicts whose resolution would expend excessive amounts of time or resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comraded.org/timor/peacebuild/manconflict.html Timor-Australia Friendship Manual] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317131906/http://www.comraded.org/timor/peacebuild/manconflict.html |date=2008-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality psychology research==
Research in [[personality psychology]] has indicated that the personality trait of [[agreeableness]]--one of the [[Big Five personality traits|five identifiable dimensions of personality]]--correlates with proclivity toward conflict avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Conflict avoidance in the workplace==
In the workplace, managers sometimes avoid directly dealing with [[Workplace conflict|conflict among co-workers]] by simply separating them. In workplaces and other situations where continued contact with a person cannot be severed, workers may eschew confrontation as being too risky or uncomfortable, opting instead to avoid directly dealing with the situation by venting to others or engaging in [[passive aggressive]] methods of attack such as [[gossip]]. Unresolved conflict in the workplace has been linked to miscommunication resulting from confusion or refusal to cooperate, increased stress, reduced creative collaboration and team problem solving, and distrust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/business/337162_workcoach29.html Workplace Coach: Companies pay the price when managers avoid dealing with conflict], Maureen, Moriarty, [[Seattlepi]], Oct. 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to an East Bay Business Times article, some possible results of conflict-averse senior executives may include {{cquote|poor-performing executives can survive because the president doesn't investigate or act on employee complaints; conflict can become malignant between departments, because there is no tie breaker to force resolution; and ineffective managers are passed from one department to the next, because the senior executive would rather play 'pass the turkey' than cook the goose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastbay.bizjournals.com/extraedge/consultants/at_work/2003/06/16/column67.html?market=eastbay Confronting a leader's conflict avoidance], Joan Lloyd.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''ECOWEEK''' ''Εβδομάδα Οικολογίας'' (Greek) is a private non-profit, non-governmental international organization aiming towards the empowerment, networking, education and training of young professionals - architects, designers, engineers, landscape architects - towards sustainable urban and public interventions and facilitation of action through fieldwork, workshops, education and training and through cooperation with local authorities, organizations and leaders.

== Mission ==
ECOWEEK mission is to raise environmental awareness and awareness on [[climate change]] and to promote the principles of [[sustainability]].

== History ==
ECOWEEK was initially established in Aegina, Greece in 2005. It was initially conceived as a community event - ''Ecological Week in Aegina'' - to raise environmental awareness of the local community of 14,000. At the time Aegina was challenged by unresolved waste management,&lt;ref&gt;Ζουμπουλάκης, Γ. (7-08-2005). ''Χωρίς νερό αλλά με σκουπίδια - Αίγινα''. ΤΟ ΒΗΜΑ - http://www.tovima.gr/relatedarticles/article/?aid=167683&lt;/ref&gt; illegal burning of waste, inexistant waste recycling program, water shortages,&lt;ref&gt;Χριστοδουλίδου, Π. (9-08-2005). ''Άρχισε ξανά η μεταφορά νερού στην Αίγινα''. ΤΟ ΕΘΝΟΣ - http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22733&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=11058&lt;/ref&gt; energy shortages, and a thriving and partially unregulated spec construction market for summer houses, which although contributed to the local economy, it put pressure in protected areas to be developed and constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Petropoulos, Thracy. (1-06-2007). ''Concrete plans unsettled''. ATHENS NEWS - http://www.aeginagreece.com/main/aegina_eco/cementfactory.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Construction also contributed in increasing illegal disposal of construction waste in natural reserves, and the increase of the summer population thus bringing the capacity of the existing infrastructures of the island to its limits.

Ecological Week in Aegina was held in Aegina for 2 years. In 2007, responding to an increase demand for environmental awareness beyond Aegina, ECOWEEK co-organized activity throughout Greece, and initiated free-admission screenings of award-winning documentary on Climate Change by Davis Guggenheim ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' with [[Al Gore]] in schools, the army, and public screenings in Athens, Thessaloniki, Patras, Lamia, Corfu, and Crete. Within this activity, in June 2007, ECOWEEK held a public free-admission keynote lecture and slide show on Climate Change by inviting Al Gore&lt;ref&gt;Πολιτισμός. (22-5-2007). ''Ο Αλ Γκορ στο Μέγαρο Μουσικής''. ΤΟ ΕΘΝΟΣ - http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22784&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=110309&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Athens Concert Hall]]. In 2007 ECOWEEK was also established in Jerusalem, Israel and in 2008 ECOWEEK initiated the first Ecological Week in [[Larnaka]], [[Cyprus]], in cooperation with the Municipality of Larnaka], involving schools, universities, professional organizations, and the general public.

== Programs ==
Since 2005, ECOWEEK developed its outreach activity towards raising awareness to a variety of population groups, age-groups and interests. For example, from children activity, cleaning of beaches, lottery of composters and solar chargers, to academic and colloquial lectures, site visits, design workshops, and film screenings.
Since 2008, ECOWEEK activity focuses more on sustainable design and ecological building, social design,and [[placemaking]]. Its activity involved primarily one-week-long design workshops and international conferences for young and established professionals - primarily architects, designers, landscape architects and engineers. ECOWEEK has developed and expanded its activity through close collaboration with cultural institutions, such as the [[American Institute of Architects]] Continental Europe, the [[British Council]], [[Goethe Institute]], academic institutions, municipalities and governments. ECOWEEK has initiated and organized activities in [[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Ag. Nikolaos]] ([[Crete]]), [[Athens]], [[Bethany (biblical village)|Azaryia]] ([[Bethany (biblical village)|Bethany]]), [[Belgrade]], [[Bucharest]], [[Cairns]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Istanbul]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Kraków]], [[London]], [[Milan]]o, [[Mumbai]], [[Sarajevo]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Thessaloniki]], [[Tilburg]], [[Pristina|Prishtina]], and [[Rome]].

In 2017 ECOWEEK published its first book titled [http://ecoweekbook.org/ ECOWEEK Book#1: 50 Voices for Sustainability], featuring fifty articles by leading architects,designers, professionals, academics and environmentalists from around the world. Among them award-winning architects [[Kengo Kuma]], [[Bjarke Ingels|BIG]], [[MVRDV]], [[Françoise-Hélène Jourda|Francoise-Helene Jourda]], [[Diébédo Francis Kéré|Diebedo Francis Kere]], [[Michael Sorkin]], Prof. David Orr and Antarctica explorer [[Robert Swan]]. The same year ECOWEEK also issued [https://issuu.com/ecoweek/docs/ecoweek_catalogue_2016 ECOWEEK: The Workshops] a publication with a collection of ideas and projects from the ECOWEEK workshops (2009-2016).

== Hassan Fathy ==
In 1989 ECOWEEK co-founder architect Elias Messinas met the late Egyptian architect [[Hassan Fathy]] - author of [[Architecture for the Poor]] - in [[Cairo]]. In that meeting, Fathy conveyed to Messinas how problems in Egypt - among them housing for the poor - could be solved. Among others Fathy challenged Messinas when he emphasized the need for young professionals to be more aware of their own community and instead of imitating architecture in international magazines, to reach out, learn about and be creative while benefiting with their work their own community.

Inspired by Fathy, ECOWEEK workshops have gradually developed a more hands-on approach that links between acedemia and the community, and between professionals and students since 2010. Aiming to both empower and train young professionals to address urban public space, placemaking, urban communities through interventions in design and hands-on workshops in urban public context, ECOWEEK and its partners have developed a model of close collaboration with local authorities, local organizations and leaders. Through this collaboration, the ECOWEEK workshops are assigned projects that are real, support them with professional consultants and see that some of the projects are implemented. Students' ideas are heard and cities, neighborhoods and communities benefit from the innovative and creative ideas of students and the professional guidance of the workshop leaders.

[[File:Ecoweek greenhouse.jpg|thumb|right]]
Aiming to establish a permanent platform and not just one-week-long activity, ECOWEEK established the GREENHOUSE in 2011 in Athens, Greece. The GREENHOUSE is a platform for innovation and entrepreneurship for society and the environment, engaging young architects, designers, landscape architects and students in real design assignments for real non-profit organizations and local authorities. The GREENHOUSE teams, under the guidance of experienced professionals, have developed sustainable solutions for schools, community centers, [https://ecoweekorg.wixsite.com/ghath2017 welfare institutions] and the urban public space in Athens and Thessaloniki in Greece and Holon,&lt;ref&gt;(20-05-2013).

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6256">In [[category theory]], the concept of an '''element''', or a '''point''', generalizes the more usual [[set theory|set theoretic]] concept of an [[element (mathematics)|element of a set]] to an object of any [[category (mathematics)|category]].  This idea often allows restating of definitions or properties of morphisms (such as [[monomorphism]] or [[product (category theory)|product]]) given by a [[universal property]] in more familiar terms, by stating their relation to elements.  Some very general theorems, such as [[Yoneda's lemma]] and the [[Mitchell embedding theorem]], are of great utility for this, by allowing one to work in a context where these translations are valid.  This approach to category theory, in particular the use of the Yoneda lemma in this way, is due to [[Grothendieck]], and is often called the method of the '''functor of points'''.

==Definition==
Suppose '''C''' is any [[category (mathematics)|category]] and ''A'', ''T'' are two objects of '''C'''.  A ''T''-valued point of ''A'' is simply an arrow &lt;math&gt;p \colon T \to A&lt;/math&gt;.  The set of all ''T''-valued points of ''A'' varies functorially with ''T'', giving rise to the "functor of points" of ''A''; according to the [[Yoneda lemma]], this completely determines ''A'' as an object of '''C'''.

==Properties of morphisms==
Many properties of morphisms can be restated in terms of points.  For example, a map &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a [[monomorphism]] if
: For all maps &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f \circ g = f \circ h&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;g = h&lt;/math&gt;.
Suppose &lt;math&gt;f \colon B \to C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g, h \colon A \to B&lt;/math&gt; in ''C''.  Then ''g'' and ''h'' are ''A''-valued points of ''B'', and therefore monomorphism is equivalent to the more familiar statement
: ''f'' is a monomorphism if it is an [[injective function]] on points of ''B''.
Some care is necessary.  ''f'' is an [[epimorphism]] if the [[dual (category theory)|dual]] condition holds:
: For all maps ''g'', ''h'' (of some suitable type), &lt;math&gt;g \circ f = h \circ f&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;g = h&lt;/math&gt;.
In set theory, the term "epimorphism" is synonymous with "surjection", i.e.
: Every point of ''C'' is the image, under ''f'', of some point of ''B''.
This is clearly not the translation of the first statement into the language of points, and in fact these statements are ''not'' equivalent in general.  However, in some contexts, such as [[abelian categories]], "monomorphism" and "epimorphism" are backed by sufficiently strong conditions that in fact they do allow such a reinterpretation on points.

Similarly, categorical constructions such as the [[product (category theory)|product]] have pointed analogues.  Recall that if ''A'', ''B'' are two objects of '''C''', their product ''A''&amp;times;''B'' is an object such that
: There exist maps &lt;math&gt;p \colon A \times B \to A,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;q \colon A \times B \to B&lt;/math&gt;, and for any ''T'' and maps &lt;math&gt;f \colon T \to A, g \colon T \to B&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a unique map &lt;math&gt;h \colon T \to A \times B&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f = p \circ h&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g = q \circ h&lt;/math&gt;.
In this definition, ''f'' and ''g'' are ''T''-valued points of ''A'' and ''B'', respectively, while ''h'' is a ''T''-valued point of ''A''&amp;times;''B''.  An alternative definition of the product is therefore:
: ''A''&amp;times;''B'' is an object of '''C''', together with projection maps &lt;math&gt;p \colon A \times B \to A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q \colon A \times B \to B&lt;/math&gt;, such that ''p'' and ''q'' furnish a bijection between points of ''A''&amp;times;''B'' and ''pairs of points'' of ''A'' and ''B''.
This is the more familiar definition of the product of two sets.

==Geometric origin==
{{see also|rational point}}
The terminology is geometric in origin; in [[algebraic geometry]], Grothendieck introduced the notion of a [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] in order to unify the subject with [[arithmetic geometry]], which dealt with the same idea of studying solutions to polynomial equations (i.e. [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]]) but where the solutions are not [[complex number]]s but [[rational number]]s, [[integer]]s, or even elements of some [[finite field]].  A scheme is then just that: a scheme for collecting together all the manifestations of a variety defined by the same equations but with solutions taken in different number sets.  One scheme gives a complex variety, whose points are its &lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt;-valued points, as well as the set of &lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Q})&lt;/math&gt;-valued points (rational solutions to the equations), and even &lt;math&gt;(\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{F}_p)&lt;/math&gt;-valued points (solutions [[Equivalence relation|modulo]] ''p'').

One feature of the language of points is evident from this example: it is, in general, not enough to consider just points with values in a single object.  For example, the equation &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; (which defines a scheme) has no [[real numbers|real]] solutions, but it has [[complex numbers|complex]] solutions, namely &lt;math&gt;\pm i&lt;/math&gt;.  It also has one solution modulo 2 and two modulo 5, 13, 29, etc. (all primes that are 1 modulo 4).  Just taking the real solutions would give no information whatsoever.

==Relation with set theory==
The situation is analogous to the case where '''C''' is the category '''Set''', of sets of actual elements.  In this case, we have the "one-pointed" set {1}, and the elements of any set ''S'' are the same as the {1}-valued points of ''S''.  In addition, though, there are the {1,2}-valued points, which are pairs of elements of ''S'', or elements of ''S''&amp;times;''S''.  In the context of sets, these higher points are extraneous: ''S'' is determined completely by its {1}-points.  However, as shown above, this is special (in this case, it is because all sets are iterated [[coproduct]]s of {1}).

'''Engineers Without Borders Ireland''' is an [[international development]] organisation for students and professionals from [[Ireland]] who share a common interest in [[sustainable development]] through engineering and [[appropriate technologies]].

The organisation was initially founded in 2007, and partook in a 2-week project in the [http://www.sonairte.ie/ Sonairte: The National Ecology Centre] in Co. Meath, Ireland. After a lull in activities, a small group of engineers began discussions on reviving EWB-Ireland in 2009. These discussions led to the formation of EWB-Ireland's first ever national committee in January 2010. The committee is a small group of committed engineers from numerous disciplines, located throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewb-ireland.org/history EWB-Ireland Website - History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, EWB-Ireland has branches in [[University College Dublin]] and [[Queens University Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewb-ireland.org/branches EWB Ireland Website - Branches]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eunomics''' is a term, first proposed by legal scholar [[Lon L. Fuller|Lon Fuller]] in 1954&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Forms Liberate: Reclaiming the Jurisprudence of Lon L Fuller |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=zyfcBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=Eunomics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2AHwMyeGfJ&amp;sig=-8U08h7ULJnnghn3y-5KxMvk3tc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiirc7i1MPcAhUH8LwKHdxtDw4Q6AEwDnoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Eunomics&amp;f=false |website=Google Books |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, to describe "the science, theory or study of good order and workable arrangements".&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, Lon L. (1954). ''American Legal Philosophy at Mid-Century - A Review of Edwin W. Patterson's ''Jurisprudence, Men and Ideas of the Law'', p. 477&lt;/ref&gt; Stemming from [[Behavioral Systems Theory]], it was an attempt to fuse what Fuller saw as the inherent [[morality]] of [[law]] with the [[empirical]] data and methods of the objective [[sciences]]. Its main practical application appears to be as a form of industrial dispute resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EUNOMICS AND JUSTICE |url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1847&amp;context=dlj |website=scholarship and law |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with New Institutional Economics==

[[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel prize]] winner [[Oliver E. Williamson]], a leading mind of the [[New institutional economics|New Institutional Economics]] (NIE) movement, refers to Fuller's definition of eunomics as a [[simulacrum]] of his understanding of the term ''[[governance]]''. Same as with the NIE, eunomics are foremost concerned with the question how to achieve a desired outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver E. (1996). ''The Mechanisms of Governance''. Oxford University Press. Page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ewa Partum''' (born 1945, [[Grodzisk Mazowiecki]] near [[Warsaw]], Poland) is a poetry artist, performance artist, filmmaker, mail artist, and conceptual artist. Her involvement with [[feminist movement]]s and themes includes the [[WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution]] in [[Los Angeles]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=Gorzodek /&gt; Her honors include an exhibition honoring female artists’ work at the [[Regional Contemporary Art Fund of Lorraine]] (Frac Lorraine) in [[Metz]], [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Prószyński, Kazimierz, Bolesław Matuszewski, and Madame Olinka. [http://monoskop.org/Poland "Poland."] Monoskop. 20 Sept. 2014. Web. 12 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Beginning in 1963, Partum studied at the State Higher School of Fine Arts in [[Łódź]]. She then went to the [[Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw]] in 1965. She studied in the Department of Painting, where Partum was particularly interested in [[poetry]] as art, and she received her diploma in 1970.&lt;ref name=Gorzodek /&gt; &lt;!--- commenting out close paraphrasing content -- She has been engaged in and studied linguistic activities and has taken part in linguistic actions and installations, which have been exhibited in galleries and outdoors.  One example is her [[Metaphysical_poets|meta-poetry]], which is the spreading of letters through texts from the history of literature. The female identity and how women are viewed are concepts that Partum examines through her studies and artwork.&lt;ref name=Gorzodek /&gt;---&gt;

==Major works==
Partum engages in linguistic and performative play in an attempt to discover new artistic language. This search for a "new language" is rooted in her belief that painting has exhausted its potential to generate new or transformative ideas.&lt;ref name="Gorzodek" /&gt;

Partum's work explores issues of female identity, including the gender bias of the art world. In interviews, she speaks about the difficulties and discrimination that she has faced as a female performance artist. This bias inspired her decision to perform naked in many pieces. At one point, Partum declared she would perform naked until women in the art world obtained equal rights.&lt;ref name="Gorzodek" /&gt; In interviews, she has spoken of the naked performances, saying "In their interpretations, many critics concentrate on the use of my naked body in my actions without actually understanding that for me it was a matter of creating a sign: a sign pointing into one direction. It was a tautological and not, as so many are inclined to believe, an egocentric strategy... My naked body is merely a tool. I'm very focused, not making any spontaneous movements. When the performance is finished I bow towards my audience as a virtuoso after a concert..."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.obieg.pl/english/31894|title = On historicizing Conceptualism and the interpretation of feminism. A conversation with Ewa Partum|date = 2014-04-08|accessdate = 2015-12-20|website = OBIEG|last = Majewska|first = Karolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partum's public work began in 1969 and continued through the seventies, integrating poetry and performance. In a performance called ''Change,'' in 1974, Partum had a makeup artist work on half of her naked body in front of an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Kazmierczak, Malgorzata. [http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/issuedetails.aspx?issueid=fd44a84c-4bba-4f6f-bc13-ce9ae90640c9&amp;articleId=5addbd5b-ead4-4ac4-8adf-a6483db47058 "Art and Documentation: English Summaries."] Google Scholars. Central and Eastern European Online Library, 2012. Web. 13 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; She announced that she was a work of art, making her body an element of the [[feminist]] [[discourse]].  This can be used as an example of [[essentialism]], in that art is about the woman’s body, and using the body as a canvas in feminist performance.

Another work, ''Self-Identification ''(1980)'','' included photomontages of her naked figure superimposed against scenes of Warsaw, among pedestrians, next to a policewoman, and in front of the presidential place, showing the controversial nature of the naked female body.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://culture.pl/en/artist/ewa-partum|title = EWA PARTUM|date = 2014-05-19|accessdate = 2014-03-07|website = CULTURE.PL|publisher = Culture.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece's title speaks to the complicated and fraught search for a female identity in a world in which the female body is often observed as a source of shock or shame.

Partum's work often focuses on the harm of traditional gender biases and expectations. For example, in ''Stupid Woman ''(1981)'' ''she performed exaggerated compliance to norms of female submissiveness and stupidity by "kiss[ing] hands of members of the audience, pour[ing] alcohol over [her] head, writ[ing] with whipped cream on the floor 'sweet art' - in other words act[ing] like a drunk and stupid woman."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In another work, ''Women, Marriage is Against You! ''(1980)'', ''she dressed in a wedding dress and wrapped herself in transparent foil, topped with a sign that said "For Men."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Then, she cut through the dress and the foil, emerging naked.

Since 1971, she has been creating "Poems By Ewa," conceptual poetry in the shape of poetic objects in which she often imprints her lips. Early conceptual-poetic pieces include Active Poetry, in which Partum used the wind to scatter cut-out letters in a variety of landscapes, using their random distribution to create poetry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her later poems compose of a strong feminist and social tone, although it is never stated in a clear or obvious way to the viewer. In one of Partum’s performances during the period of martial law in 1982, she is naked and wearing red lipstick, and formed the word “Solidarnosc,” meaning solidarity, one by one with her lips on a piece of white paper.&lt;ref name="Pawel"&gt;Leszkowicz, Pawel. [http://cejsh.icm.edu.pl/cejsh/element/bwmeta1.element.61faa4b4-995f-3a8e-b135-4304b41360c9 "Sex and Subversion in the Art of the People's Republic of Poland."] The Central European Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities 20 (2007): 51-85. Google Scholars. Web. 13 Oct. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  This expresses one of the themes of her work that includes parodying the manners in which women try to conform to men’s idealized expectations of them. In an exhibition on the subject of the [[Berlin Wall]], she photographs herself naked in high-heels, and holding up a big letter “O” in her right hand and a “W” in her left, signifying Ost-West Schatten, or East-West shadows.&lt;ref name="Pawel" /&gt;

Partum's films act both as documentation of her poetic and performative work and as explorations of film as a medium, in line with the structural cinema of the 1960s. For example, in ''Tautological Cinema (''a series of short films made between 1973 and 1974), Partum examines the automated nature and materiality of film.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://artmuseum.pl/en/filmoteka/praca/partum-ewa-tautological-cinema|title = EWA PARTUM: Tautological Cinema|date = 2011-06-11|accessdate = 2015-03-07|website = FILMOTEKA MUZEUM|publisher = Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content of one piece, ''Ten Meters of Film, ''draws a simple correlation between film length and running time, denoting on the screen the number of meters of film that have run through the projector (up to ten). Another short film display the artist's face in a variety of scenes with at least one feature obscured. The film calls into question the ability of the artist to fully communicate an idea, arguing that once the work is observed by another, the authority of the artist is lost. Of the films and of film as a medium, Partum as said, "It’s not dealing with aesthetics. It’s rather a new sort of philosophical practice that operates in the area in which the relation between the film image and the camerawork covers the whole interest in the film itself.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Partum also worked as the organizer and curator of a very influential mail art gallery from 1971 through 1977. The gallery, Galeria Address, displayed the work of Fluxus artists, and others. As part of the gallery, Partum published catalogs and books.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Partum's work was often affected by Polish censors, who refused to allows its distribution in publications.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
 
==Exhibitions==
&lt;!--- commenting out close paraphrasing content --In 1972, Partum founded one of the most significant galleries of mail art and art theory, Adres, in [[Lodz]]. More exhibitions showing Partum’s work include [[Bonn_Women's_Museum|Museum of Women]] in [[Bonn]] in 1985, and an exhibition at Badischer Kunstverein in [[Karlsruhe]] in 2001, called “Act of a Thought is an Act of Art.” She was also recognized at The Legality of Space at the Wyspa Institute of Art in [[Gdansk]] and in the Self-identification in [[Krolikarnia]], which is a division of the [[National Museum in Warsaw]]. Partum's art has been included in group exhibitions in [[Spain]], [[Canada]], [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]], [[Belgium]], [[Sweden]], [[Japan]], [[Uruguay]], [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]] and the [[United States]], specifically located in [[Boston]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York]].&lt;ref name=Gorzodek /&gt;----&gt;In July 2013, the Frac Lorraine in [[Metz, France]]p held an exhibition entitled, “Bad Girls: A Collection in Action,” honoring female artists who dedicated their work to deconstructing established order and creating room for freedom, experience, and life, changing the audience’s vision of the future and encouraging social change.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Several retrospectives of Partum's work have occurred, including ''Ewa Partum: The Legality of Space ''at the Wyspa Institute of Art (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.itsliquid.com/ewa-partum.html|title = ewa partum – the legality of space|accessdate = 2015-03-07|website = itsliquid|publisher = itsliquid}}&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews, Partum has celebrated the work of retrospective exhibitions, in that they allow the audience and critics to "trace the genealogy of the artist's language."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In her early years of being an artists Ewa Partum became upset with the discrimination of her art for being and female artists so she began to use her naked body in her artworks. Even though Patrum knew she would receive even more discrimination for this she continued to do it because of the later message she knew it would send.

'''Freedom House''' is a nonprofit community-based organization in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]], [[Massachusetts]] (a neighborhood of [[Boston]]).  Freedom House is located in an area sometimes referred to as Grove Hall that lies along Blue Hill Ave. at the border between the [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] and [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] neighborhoods of [[Boston]].  Although it was historically identified with Roxbury, Freedom House currently refers to itself as being located either in Dorchester or in Grove Hall.&lt;ref name=web&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.com Freedom House] Official Web Site&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

The mission of Freedom House is to promote economic self-sufficiency and social justice for residents in historically underserved neighborhoods through targeted educational development, increased civic and political engagement and progressive cultural advocacy.&lt;ref name=web/&gt;

==History==
Freedom House was founded in 1949 as a center of civil rights and advocacy for Boston's African American community.  The founders were the social workers (and married couple) [[Otto P. Snowden]] and [[Muriel S. Snowden]]. The initial goal of Freedom House was to centralize community activism in the fight for neighborhood improvement, good schools, and harmony among racial, ethnic, and religious groups in Roxbury (a neighborhood of [[Boston]]), [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="fhoverview"&gt;[http://digitalcollections.lib.neu.edu/Greenstone/cgi-bin/library.exe?e=p-01000-00---off-0freedomh--00-1--0-10-0---0---0prompt-10---4-------0-1l--11-en-Zz-1---20-about---00-3-1-00-0-0-11-1-0utfZz-8-00&amp;a=p&amp;p=overview Freedom House Overview] "Freedom House Photographs: Roxbury People, Places and Events 1950-1975," Northeastern University Libraries, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticized in the 1960s by black militants for taking a "self-help" approach to racial equality, Freedom House re-examined its mission, and went on to play an increasingly critical role in the struggle for civil rights in Boston,&lt;ref&gt;"Muriel Sutherland Snowden" in ''Notable American Women'', Susan Ware, Stacy Lorraine Braukman, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard University Press, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-674-01488-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially during the period of desegregation of Boston's public schools.

Freedom House's original location was at 151 Humboldt Street in Roxbury.  In 1952, it moved to 14 Crawford Street on the Grove Hall section of Roxbury.  On the night of January 31, 1960, a fire destroyed the Crawford Street facility. A rebuilding campaign ensued, and Boston Mayor [[John F. Collins]] was the first to "buy a brick" to help in this effort. The rebuilt facility opened in 1961 and remains the current home of the organization.&lt;ref name="fhfa"&gt;[http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m16findbioghist.htm Finding aid for the records of Freedom House] Northeastern University Libraries, Archives and Special Collections, Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Muriel and Otto Snowden retired as co-directors.  A number of directors have served since then; the Executive Director is currently the Snowden's daughter, Gail Snowden.

In 1996, Freedom House considered merging with other community organizations, although in the end it decided not to do so.&lt;ref name="fhfa" /&gt;

==Activities==

The initial focus of the organization was on urban renewal; neighborhood improvement programs designed to protect Upper Roxbury from urban blight began in 1949 when Freedom House helped to organize neighborhood clean-up projects and playground construction.  Concerned over the escalating number of bars in the neighborhood, Freedom House led the community in an effort to reduce the number of new and renewed applications for liquor licenses.&lt;ref name="fhlegacy"&gt;[http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/freedom_house/Birmingham.htm Freedom House: A Legacy Preserved] Online exhibit. Northeastern University Libraries, Archives and Special Collections. Boston, MA. 2003. April Hagins with Michelle Light.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Early programming also focused on strengthening relations between the African American and Jewish residents of Upper Roxbury.  An interracial preschool, one of few in the city, was established&lt;ref name="fhoverview" /&gt; and Freedom House participated in a Black-Jewish Roundtable fostering business ties and friendships between black and Jewish entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Yawu (2000, October 26). "Freedom House joins Black-Jewish Roundtable effort." ''Bay State Banner'', p. 2. ( Retrieved December 17, 2008, from Ethnic NewsWatch (ENW) database (restricted to subscribers). (Document ID: 492164411).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of education, Freedom House administered Project Reach, supported by a private donation, which gave scholarship funds for minority students to go to college.  Freedom House also provided scholarship counseling.  A travel/study program provided scholarships for high school students to study in [[Europe]] for the summer. In the years before court-ordered desegregation, Freedom House also raised money to support Operation Exodus, a voluntary desegregation project that bused predominantly African American students from overcrowded schools in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] and [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] to predominantly white, underenrolled schools in other parts of Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Edgar J. Driscoll Jr.|title=Muriel Snowden, 72; Cofounder of Freedom House in Roxbury|publisher=Boston Globe|date=1988-10-01|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8081628.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archives and Special Collections Finding Aids: Collection of Freedom House, Inc., records |publisher=Northeastern University|url=http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/collect/findaids/m16findbioghist.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Smock, William H. [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=493555 "Operation Exodus: Rebuff to Politicians"] (''Harvard Crimson'', October 18, 1965.) for more information about Operation Exodus.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1966, Operation Exodus discontinued busing children; the Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity ([[METCO]]) began busing Boston children between the city and suburban schools on a voluntary basis. Exodus bused children within the [[City of Boston]] while [[METCO]] was a separate program of urban and suburban exchange.

[[School desegregation]] was court-ordered in Boston in 1974, and in that year, the Freedom House Institute on Schools and Education was established.  The Institute began as a means of information dissemination to African-American families, as well as to ensure the safety of school children being bused to neighborhoods attempting to block the desegregation order.&lt;ref name="fhlegacy" /&gt;  The Institute grew to become a locus of community action, offering tutoring and teacher training, and providing a forum for communication between families and city administrators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/freedom_house/full_text/edu_cover.htm Freedom House Institute on Schools and Education], May 15, 1974(brochure)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of employment, Freedom House held job fairs, including Boston's first job fair for minorities, and promoted affirmative action.  They raised money for college scholarships for black students and for study programs in Africa. They even established a credit union.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar J. Driscoll Jr., Globe Staff (1988, October 1). "Muriel Snowden, 72; Cofounder of Freedom House in Roxbury" (Obituary, third edition) ''Boston Globe'', p. 75.  Retrieved December 17, 2008, from Boston Globe database via Proquest Massachusetts Newspapers (restricted to subscribers).&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom House has often acted as a forum and meeting place for the community, in times of grief as well as in times of celebration.  The Center has held galas, fashion shows and tea parties to raise money for causes that it supported, celebrated the anniversaries and birthdays of notables like [[Edward Brooke]], an African-American U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, and held Christmas and Halloween parties for children. More than 500 residents attended a mass meeting at Freedom House after the murder of 16-year-old Daniela Saunders in 1963.

Currently, Freedom House programs focus on education, technology, and leadership development.  Freedom House provides tutoring for the [[Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System|MCAS]] (Mass. school achievement tests), access to a computer lab, and technology training.  Freedom House also works with other organizations and the [[City of Boston]] to lower the dropout rate in Boston's high schools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1292">The '''Functional Approach''' is considered to be the second paradigm of psychology. This idea focuses on the function of the mental processes which involves consciousnesses. (Gordon, 1995) This approach was developed by William James in 1890. James was the first American Psychologist and wrote the first general textbook regarding psychology.  In this approach he reasoned that the mental act of consciousness must be an important biological function (Schacter et al., 2011) He also noted that it was a psychologist's job to understand these functions so they can discover how the mental process operates. This idea was an alternative approach to the structuralism, which was the first paradigm(Gordon, 1995). 

In second language acquisition (SLA) functional approaches are of similarities with Chomsky's Universal Grammar (UG). Focus is on the use of language in real situations (performance), as well as underlying knowledge (competence).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2774">The "'''heterogony of ends'''" is a famous expression formulated in 1886 by German psychologist [[Wilhelm Wundt]], to denote the phenomenon of how goal-directed activity often cause experiences that modify the original motivational pattern.&lt;ref name="Schneider86p172"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wundt (1886) [https://archive.org/details/ethikeineunters03wundgoog ''Ethik. Eine Untersuchung der Thatsachen und Gesetze des sittlichen Lebens'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wundt (1897) [https://archive.org/details/ethicsaninvestig00wunduoft ''Ethics, an investigation of the facts and laws of the moral life''] translated from the second German edition (1892)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;txwes.edu [http://faculty.txwes.edu/jbrown06/course1/Chapter9VoluntarismStructuralismandOtherEarlyAp.pptx ''Voluntarism, Structuralism, and Other Early Approaches to Psychology'']&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle is exemplified in the emergence of new motives during the course of a chain of activities.
For example, one may accept the invitation of a
friend to attend an art show. Initially, the motive is simply the anticipation of a pleasant evening in good friendship, but in the course of the evening, one encounters a highly desirable work of art and wishes to purchase it. A whole new set of motives now enters the picture and now exist alongside and in addition to the
original motive. The Heterogeny of Ends formulates that an ongoing behavioral sequence must often be understood in terms of ever-shifting patterns of primary and secondary goals. Another example would be how cat chasing a mouse may suddenly find it necessary to compete with a partner, overcome an unexpected barrier, or avoid a danger. Ends, goals, and purposes keep changing.&lt;ref&gt;Cantfort [http://faculty.uncfsu.edu/tvancantfort/Presentation10/PSYC400/PDFfiles/Wundt.pdf ''History &amp; Systems'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The original German expression was ''Heterogonie der Zwecke,'' variously translated in English as  heterogony/heterogeneity/heterogenesis of ends/goals/purposes.&lt;ref name="Schneider86p172"&gt;Schneider, Louis (1986)[https://books.google.com/books?id=pdL47hWnKOoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA172 ''Paradox and society: the work of Bernard Mandeville''] pp. 172–73&lt;/ref&gt; It was first formulated by Wundt in 1886, in his book ''Ethics''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicola Abbagnano]] and Giovanni Fornero (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=DNpue_u2V7YC&amp;pg=PA542 ''Diccionario de filosofía''] p. 542&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian philosopher [[Giambattista Vico]] is sometimes credited as having anticipated and influenced Wundt's idea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Harold Fisch]] ''Introduction'' to the English translation of ''The new science of Giambattista Vico'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=atO7mF04iVoC&amp;pg=PR32 p.xxxii]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6332">'''Induced gravity''' (or '''emergent gravity''') is an idea in [[quantum gravity]] that [[space-time curvature]] and its dynamics [[emergence|emerge]] as a [[mean field approximation]] of underlying microscopic [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], similar to the [[fluid mechanics]] approximation of [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s. The concept was originally proposed by [[Andrei Sakharov]] in 1967.

==Overview==
Sakharov observed that many [[condensed matter]] systems give rise to emergent phenomena that are analogous to [[general relativity]]. For example, [[Crystallographic defect|crystal defects]] can look  like [[curvature]] and [[Torsion tensor|torsion]] in an [[Einstein–Cartan theory|Einstein–Cartan spacetime]]. This allows one to create a theory of gravity with torsion from a [[world crystal]] model of spacetime&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| title =  Gravity as Theory of Defects in a Crystal with Only Second-Gradient Elasticity
| author =  [[Hagen Kleinert|H. Kleinert]]
| journal = Annalen der Physik
| volume = 44
| issue =  2

| doi =10.1002/andp.19874990206|bibcode = 1987AnP...499..117K }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the lattice spacing is of the order of a [[Planck length]].
Sakharov's idea was to start with an arbitrary background [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] (in modern treatments, possibly with torsion) and introduce quantum fields (matter) on it but not introduce any gravitational dynamics explicitly. This gives rise to an [[effective action]] which to [[one-loop order]] contains the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]] with a [[cosmological constant]]. In other words, general relativity arises as an emergent property of matter fields and is not put in by hand. On the other hand, such models typically predict huge [[cosmological constant]]s.

Some argue that the particular models proposed by Sakharov and others have been proven impossible by the [[Weinberg–Witten theorem]]. However, models with emergent gravity are possible as long as other things, such as spacetime dimensions, emerge together with gravity. Developments in [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] after 1997 suggest that the microphysical degrees of freedom in induced gravity might be radically different. The bulk space-time arises as an emergent phenomenon of the quantum degrees of freedom that are entangled and live in the boundary of the space-time. According to some prominent researchers in emergent gravity (such as [[Mark Van Raamsdonk]]) spacetime is built up of quantum entanglement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Raamsdonk|first=Mark|date=19 June 2010|title=Building up spacetime with quantum entanglement.|journal=General Relativity and Gravitation|volume=42|issue=10|pages=2323–2329|doi=10.1007/s10714-010-1034-0|arxiv=1005.3035|bibcode=2010GReGr..42.2323V}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that quantum entanglement is the fundamental property that gives rise to spacetime. In 1995, [[Theodore Jacobson|Jacobson]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacobson|first=Ted|date=1995-08-14|title=Thermodynamics of Spacetime: The Einstein Equation of State|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=75|issue=7|pages=1260–1263|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1260|pmid=10060248|bibcode=1995PhRvL..75.1260J|arxiv=gr-qc/9504004}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the [[Einstein field equations]] can be derived from the first law of thermodynamics applied at local Rindler horizons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26489">In [[mathematics]], an '''iterated function''' is a function {{math|''X&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;X''}} (that is, a function from some [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{mvar|X}} to itself) which is obtained  by [[function composition|composing]] another function {{math|''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;X''}} with itself a certain number of times. The process of repeatedly applying the same function is called [[iteration]]. In this process, starting from some initial number, the result of applying a given function is fed again in the function as input, and this process is repeated.

Iterated functions are objects of study in [[computer science]], [[fractals]],  [[dynamical system]]s, mathematics and [[renormalization group]] physics.

==Definition==
The formal definition of an iterated function on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' follows.

Let {{mvar|''X''}} be a set and {{math|''f:  X → X''}} be a [[function (mathematics)|function]].

Define {{math| ''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}  as the ''n''-th iterate  of {{mvar|''f''}}, where ''n'' is a non-negative integer, by:

:: &lt;math&gt;f^0 ~   \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}  ~ \operatorname{id}_X&lt;/math&gt;
and
:: &lt;math&gt;f^{n+1} ~ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} ~ f \circ f^{n},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|id&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[identity function]] on {{mvar|''X''}} and {{math|''f''○''g''}}  denotes [[function composition]]. That is, 
::{{math|(''f''○''g'')(''x'') {{=}} ''f'' (''g''(''x''))}}, 
always [[associative]].

Because the notation  {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} may refer to both iteration (composition) of the function {{mvar|''f''}} or [[Exponentiation#Exponential notation for function names|exponentiation of the function]] {{mvar|''f''}} (the latter is commonly used in [[Trigonometric functions|trigonometry]]), some mathematicians choose to write  {{math|''f'' °&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for the ''n''-th iterate  of the function {{mvar|''f''}}.

==Abelian property and iteration sequences==
In general, the following identity holds for all non-negative integers {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}},

: &lt;math&gt;f^{m} \circ f^{n} =   f^{n} \circ f^{m} = f^{m+n}~.&lt;/math&gt;

This is structurally identical to the property of [[exponentiation]] that {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''m''+''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, i.e. the special case {{math|''f''(''x''){{=}}''ax''}}.

In general, for arbitrary general (negative, non-integer, etc.) indices {{mvar|m}} and {{mvar|n}}, this relation is called the '''translation functional equation''', cf. [[Schröder's equation]] and [[Abel equation]]. On a logarithmic scale, this reduces to the '''nesting property''' of [[Chebyshev polynomials]],   {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')){{=}}''T''&lt;sub&gt;''m n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}}, since  {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') {{=}} cos(''n'' arcos(''x'' ))}}.

The relation  {{math|(''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''m''&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} (''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''n''&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''mn''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} also holds, analogous to the property of exponentiation that  {{math|(''a''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}}(''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''mn''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

The sequence of functions  {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is called a '''Picard sequence''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Functional equations in a single variable |last=Kuczma |first=Marek| authorlink=Marek Kuczma|series=Monografie Matematyczne |year=1968 |publisher=PWN – Polish Scientific Publishers |location=Warszawa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Iterative Functional Equations| last=Kuczma| first=M., Choczewski B., and Ger, R. |year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn= 0-521-35561-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; named after [[Charles Émile Picard]].

For a given {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|X}}, the [[sequence]] of values  {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} is called the '''[[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]]''' of {{mvar|x}}.

If  {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (''x'') {{=}}  ''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''+''m''&lt;/sup&gt; (''x'')}} for some integer {{mvar|m}}, the orbit is called a '''periodic orbit'''.  The smallest such value of {{mvar|m}} for a given {{mvar|x}} is called the '''period of the orbit'''. The point {{mvar|x}} itself is called a [[periodic point]]. The [[cycle detection]] problem in computer science is the [[algorithm]]ic problem of finding the first periodic point in an orbit, and the period of the orbit.

==Fixed points==

If ''f''(''x'') = ''x'' for some ''x'' in ''X'' (that is, the period of the orbit of ''x'' is 1), then ''x'' is called a '''[[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]''' of the iterated sequence.  The set of fixed points is often denoted as '''Fix'''(''f'' ).  There exist a number of [[fixed-point theorem]]s that guarantee the existence of fixed points in various situations, including the [[Banach fixed point theorem]] and the [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]].

There are several techniques for [[convergence acceleration]] of the sequences produced by [[fixed point iteration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Carleson|first=L.
|last2= Gamelin|first2= T. D. W.|title=Complex dynamics|series=Universitext: Tracts in Mathematics|publisher= Springer-Verlag|year=1993 
|isbn=0-387-97942-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Aitken method]] applied to an iterated fixed point is known as [[Steffensen's method]], and produces quadratic convergence.

==Limiting behaviour==

Upon iteration, one may find that there are sets that shrink and converge towards a single point. In such a case, the point that is converged to is known as an [[attractive fixed point]]. Conversely, iteration may give the appearance of points diverging away from a single point; this would be the case for an [[unstable fixed point]].&lt;ref&gt;Istratescu, Vasile  (1981). ''Fixed Point Theory, An Introduction'',  D. Reidel, Holland.  {{ISBN|90-277-1224-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  
When the points of the orbit converge to one or more limits, the set of [[accumulation point]]s of the orbit is known as the '''[[limit set]]''' or the '''ω-limit set'''.

The ideas of attraction and repulsion generalize similarly; one may categorize iterates into [[stable manifold|stable set]]s and [[unstable set]]s, according to the behaviour of small [[neighborhood]]s under iteration. (Also see [[Infinite compositions of analytic functions]].)

Other limiting behaviours are possible; for example, [[wandering point]]s are points that move away, and never come back even close to where they started.

==Invariant measure==
If one considers the evolution of a density distribution, rather than that of individual point dynamics, then the limiting behavior is given by the [[invariant measure]]. It can be visualized as the behavior of a point-cloud or dust-cloud under repeated iteration. The invariant measure is a eigenstate of the Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron operator or [[transfer operator]], corresponding to an eigenvalue of 1. Smaller eigenvalues correspond to unstable, decaying states.

In general, because repeated iteration corresponds to a shift, the transfer operator, and its adjoint, the [[Koopman operator]] can both be interpreted as [[shift operator]]s action on a [[shift space]].  The theory of [[subshifts of finite type]] provides general insight into many iterated functions, especially those leading to chaos.

==Fractional iterates and flows, and negative iterates==

In some instances,&lt;ref&gt;The notion {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;1/''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} must be used with care when the equation {{math|''g''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}}  has multiple solutions, which is normally the case, as in [[Functional square root|Babbage's equation]] of the functional roots of the identity map. For example, for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}} and {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 4''x''−6}}, both {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} 6−2''x''}} and {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''−2}} are  solutions; so the expression {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ½&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} doesn't denote a unique function, just as algebraic roots of numbers are multiple. The issue is quite similar to [[division by zero#In algebra|division by zero]]. The roots chosen are normally the ones belonging to the orbit under study.&lt;/ref&gt; fractional iteration of a function can be defined:  for instance, a [[functional square root|half iterate]] of a function {{mvar|f}} is a function {{mvar|''g''}} such that {{math|''g''(''g''(''x'')) {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}}. This function {{math|''g''(''x'')}} can be written using the index notation as {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ½&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} . Similarly, {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ⅓&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} is the function defined such that {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;⅓&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''&lt;sup&gt;⅓&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''&lt;sup&gt;⅓&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''))) {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}}, while {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ⅔&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} may be defined equal to {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ⅓&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''&lt;sup&gt; ⅓&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''))}}, and so forth, all based on the principle, mentioned earlier, that {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''m''&lt;/sup&gt;○''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''n''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''m'' + ''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This idea can be generalized so that the iteration count {{mvar|n}} becomes a '''continuous parameter''', a sort of continuous "time" of a continuous [[Orbit (dynamics)|orbit]].

In such cases, one refers to the system as a [[flow (mathematics)|flow]], specified by [[Schröder's equation]]. (cf. Section on [[#Conjugacy|conjugacy]] below.)

Negative iterates correspond to function inverses and their compositions. For example, {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} is the normal inverse of {{mvar|f}}, while {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} is the inverse composed with itself, i.e. {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''))}}. Fractional negative iterates are defined analogously to fractional positive ones; for example, {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;½&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} is defined such that {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus; ½&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;½&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')) {{=}}  ''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, or, equivalently, such that {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; &amp;minus;½&lt;/sup&gt;(''f''&lt;sup&gt; ½&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')) {{=}} ''f''&lt;sup&gt; 0&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''x''}}.

== Some formulas for fractional iteration==

One of several methods of finding a series formula for fractional iteration, making use of a fixed point, is as follows.

# First determine a fixed point for the function such that {{math|''f''(''a''){{=}}''a''}} .
# Define   {{math|''f &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''(''a''){{=}}''a''}} for all ''n'' belonging to the reals. This, in some ways, is the most natural extra condition to place upon the fractional iterates.
# Expand {{math|''f &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''(''x'')}}   around the fixed point ''a'' as a [[Taylor series]],
#:&lt;math&gt;
f^n(x) = f^n(a) + (x-a)\frac{d}{dx}f^n(x)|_{x=a} + \frac{(x-a)^2}2\frac{d^2}{dx^2}f^n(x)|_{x=a} +\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
# Expand out
#:&lt;math&gt;
f^n\left(x\right) = f^n(a) + (x-a) f'(a)f'(f(a))f'(f^2(a))\cdots f'(f^{n-1}(a)) + \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
#  Substitute in for   {{math|''f  &lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''(''a''){{=}} ''a''}}, for any ''k'', 
#:&lt;math&gt;
f^n\left(x\right) = a + (x-a) f'(a)^{n} + \frac{(x-a)^2}2(f''(a)f'(a)^{n-1})\left(1+f'(a)+\cdots+f'(a)^{n-1}  \right)+\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
# Make use of the [[geometric progression]] to simplify terms,
#:&lt;math&gt;
f^n\left(x\right) = a + (x-a) f'(a)^{n} + \frac{(x-a)^2}2(f''(a)f'(a)^{n-1})\frac{f'(a)^n-1}{f'(a)-1}+\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
#* There is a special case when {{math|''f'' '(a){{=}}1}},
#:&lt;math&gt;
f^n\left(x\right) = x  + \frac{(x-a)^2}2(n f''(a))+ \frac{(x-a)^3}6\left(\frac{3}{2}n(n-1) f''(a)^2 + n f'''(a)\right)+\cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
# When ''n'' is not an integer, make use of the power formula {{math| ''y'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} exp(''n'' ln(''y''))}}.
This can be carried on indefinitely, although inefficiently, as the latter terms become increasingly complicated.
A more systematic procedure is outlined in the following section on '''Conjugacy'''.

===Example 1===
For example, setting {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''Cx''+''D''}}  gives the fixed point {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''D''/(1-''C'')}}, so  the above formula terminates to just
:&lt;math&gt;
f^n(x)=\frac{D}{1-C} + (x-\frac{D}{1-C})C^n=C^nx+\frac{1-C^n}{1-C}D ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
which is trivial to check.

===Example 2===
Find the value of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}^{ \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\cdots}} }&lt;/math&gt; where this is done ''n'' times (and possibly the interpolated values when ''n'' is not an integer). We have {{math|''f''(''x''){{=}}{{sqrt|2}}&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. A fixed point is {{math|''a''{{=}}''f''(2){{=}}2}}.

So set ''x''=1 and {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (1)}} expanded around the fixed point value of 2 is then an infinite series,
:&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt{2}^{ \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\cdots}} } = f^n(1) = 2  - (\ln 2)^n +  \frac{(\ln 2)^{n+1}((\ln 2)^n-1)}{4(\ln 2-1)} - \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;
which, taking just the first three terms, is correct to the first decimal place when ''n'' is positive&amp;mdash;cf. [[Tetration]]: {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(1) {{=}} &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;{{sqrt|2}} }}. (Using the other fixed point {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''f''(4) {{=}} 4}} causes the series to diverge.)

For {{math| ''n'' {{=}} −1}}, the series computes the inverse function,  {{math| 2 ln''x''/ln 2}}.

===Example 3===
With the function   {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, expand around the fixed point 1 to get the series
: &lt;math&gt;
f^n(x) = 1 + b^n(x-1) + \frac{1}2b^{n}(b^n-1)(x-1)^2 + \frac{1}{3!}b^n (b^n-1)(b^n-2)(x-1)^3 + \cdots  ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
which is simply the Taylor series of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;(''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;/sup&gt; expanded around 1.

==Conjugacy==

If {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are two iterated functions, and there exists a [[homeomorphism]] {{mvar|h}} such that  {{math| ''g'' {{=}}  ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ○ ''f'' ○ ''h'' }},  then {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are said to be [[Topological conjugacy|topologically conjugate]].

Clearly, topological conjugacy is preserved under iteration, as {{math|''g''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;{{=}}''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;  ○  ''f'' &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; ○ ''h''}}.  Thus, if one can solve for one iterated function system, one also  has solutions for all topologically conjugate systems. For example, the [[tent map]] is topologically conjugate to the [[logistic map]]. As a special case, taking {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''+1}}, one has the iteration of {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} ''h''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''h''(''x'')+1)}} as 
:{{math|''g''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''h''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''h''(''x'') + ''n'')}},  &amp;nbsp;  for any function {{mvar|h}}.

Making the substitution {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''h''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''y'') {{=}} ''ϕ''(''y'')}} yields 
:{{math|''g''(''ϕ''(''y'')) {{=}} ''ϕ''(''y''+1)}},  &amp;nbsp; a form known as the [[Abel equation]].

Even in the absence of a strict homeomorphism, near a fixed point, here taken to be at {{mvar|x}} = 0, {{mvar|f}}(0) = 0, one may often solve&lt;ref&gt;Kimura, Tosihusa  (1971). "On the Iteration of Analytic Functions",  [http://www.math.sci.kobe-u.ac.jp/~fe/ ''Funkcialaj Ekvacioj''] '''14''', 197-238.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Schröder's equation]] for a function  {{mvar|Ψ}}, which makes {{math|''f''(''x'')}} locally conjugate to a mere dilation, {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} ''f'' '(0) ''x''}}, that is  
:{{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}}  ''Ψ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''f'' '(0)  ''Ψ''(''x''))}}.

Thus, its iteration orbit, or flow, under suitable provisions (e.g., {{math|''f'' '(0) ≠ 1}}), amounts to the conjugate of the orbit of the monomial, 
:{{math|''Ψ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''f'' '(0)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ''Ψ''(''x''))}},  
where {{mvar|n}} in this expression serves as a plain exponent: ''functional iteration has been reduced to multiplication!''  Here, however, the exponent {{mvar|n}} no longer needs be integer or positive, and is a continuous "time" of evolution for the full orbit:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Curtright |first=T.L. |authorlink=Thomas Curtright|author2=Zachos, C.K. |authorlink2=Cosmas Zachos | year=2009|title=Evolution Profiles and Functional Equations |journal=Journal of Physics A |volume=42|issue=48 |pages=485208|doi=10.1088/1751-8113/42/48/485208|arxiv=0909.2424|bibcode=2009JPhA...42V5208C}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[monoid]] of the Picard sequence (cf. [[transformation semigroup]]) has generalized to a full [[continuous group]].&lt;ref&gt;For explicit instance, example 2 above amounts to just {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''Ψ''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;((ln2)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; ''Ψ''(''x''))}}, for ''any n'', not necessarily integer, where {{mvar|''Ψ''}} is the solution of the relevant [[Schröder's equation]], {{math|''Ψ''({{sqrt|2}}&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;){{=}} ln2 ''Ψ''(''x'')}}. This solution is also the infinite ''m'' limit of {{math|(''f'' &lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') −2)/(ln2)&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The functions below the (&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;)  sine are six integral iterates below it, starting with the second iterate (&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;) and ending with the 64th iterate.

]]

This method (perturbative determination of the principal [[eigenfunction]] {{mvar|Ψ}}, cf. [[Carleman matrix]]) is equivalent to the algorithm of the preceding section, albeit, in practice,  more powerful and systematic.

==Markov chains==
If the function is linear and can be described by a [[stochastic matrix]], that is, a matrix whose rows or columns sum to one, then the iterated system is known as a [[Markov chain]].

==Examples==
There are [[List of chaotic maps|many chaotic maps]]. 
Well-known iterated functions include the [[Mandelbrot set]] and [[iterated function systems]].

[[Ernst Schröder]],&lt;ref name="schr"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schröder |first=Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Schröder |year=1870 |title=Ueber iterirte Functionen|journal=Math. Ann. |volume=3 |issue= 2|pages=296&amp;ndash;322 | doi=10.1007/BF01443992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1870, worked out special cases of the [[logistic map]], such as the chaotic case {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 4''x''(1−''x'')}}, so that {{math|''Ψ''(''x'') {{=}} arcsin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;({{radic|''x''}})}}, hence {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;  arcsin({{radic|''x''}}))}}.

A nonchaotic case  Schröder also illustrated with his method,  {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''(1 − ''x'')}}, yielded  {{math|''Ψ''(''x'') {{=}} −{{sfrac|1|2}} ln(1−2''x'')}}, and hence  {{math|''f'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} −{{sfrac|1|2}}((1−2''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;−1)}}.

If {{mvar|''f''}} is the [[group action|action]] of a group element on a set, then the iterated function corresponds to a [[free group]].

Most functions do not have explicit general [[closed-form expression]]s for the ''n''-th iterate. The table below lists some&lt;ref name="schr"/&gt; that do. Note that all these expressions are valid even for non-integer and negative ''n'', as well as positive integer ''n''.

==Means of study==
Iterated functions can be studied with the [[Artin–Mazur zeta function]] and with [[transfer operator]]s.

==In computer science==
In [[computer science]], iterated functions occur as a special case of [[recursion (computer science)|recursive functions]], which in turn anchor the study of such broad topics as [[lambda calculus]], or narrower ones, such as the [[denotational semantics]] of computer programs.

==Definitions in terms of iterated functions==
Two important [[functional (mathematics)|functionals]] can be defined in terms of iterated functions. These are [[summation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left\{b+1,\sum_{i=a}^b g(i)\right\} \equiv \left( \{i,x\} \rightarrow \{ i+1 ,x+g(i) \}\right)^{b-a+1} \{a,0\}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the equivalent product:

:&lt;math&gt;
\left\{b+1,\prod_{i=a}^b g(i)\right\} \equiv \left( \{i,x\} \rightarrow \{ i+1 ,x g(i) \}\right)^{b-a+1} \{a,1\}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Functional derivative==
The [[functional derivative]] of an iterated function is given by the recursive formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ \delta f^N(x)}{\delta f(y)} = f'( f^{N-1}(x) ) \frac{ \delta f^{N-1}(x)}{\delta f(y)} + \delta( f^{N-1}(x) - y ) &lt;/math&gt;

==Lie's data transport equation==
Iterated functions crop up in the series expansion of combined functions, such as  {{math|''g''(''f''(''x''))}}.

Given the [[Koenigs function#Structure of univalent semigroups|iteration velocity]], or [[beta function (physics)]],

:&lt;math&gt;
g(f(x)) = \exp\left[ v(x) \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} \right] g(x).
&lt;/math&gt;
For example, for rigid advection, if {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x'' + ''t''}}, then {{math|''v''(''x'') {{=}} ''t''}}.  Consequently,  {{math|''g''(''x'' + ''t'') {{=}} exp(''t'' ∂/∂''x'')  ''g''(''x'')}}, action by a plain [[shift operator]].

Conversely, one may   specify {{math|''f''(''x'')}}  given an arbitrary {{math|''v''(''x'')}}, through the generic [[Abel equation]]  discussed above,
:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = h^{-1}(h(x)+1) ,
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
h(x) = \int{\frac{1}{v(x)}dx} .
&lt;/math&gt;
This is evident by noting that 
:&lt;math&gt;f^n(x)=h^{-1}(h(x)+n)~.&lt;/math&gt;

For continuous iteration index {{mvar|t}}, then, now written as a subscript, this amounts to Lie's celebrated exponential realization of a continuous group,
:&lt;math&gt;e^{t~\frac{\partial ~~}{\partial h(x)}} g(x)= g(h^{-1}(h(x )+t))= g(f_t(x)).&lt;/math&gt;
The initial flow velocity {{mvar|v}} suffices to determine the entire flow, given this exponential realization which automatically provides the  general solution to the ''translation functional equation'',&lt;ref  name="acz"&gt;Aczel, J (2006), ''Lectures on Functional 
Equations and Their Applications'' (Dover Books on Mathematics, 2006), Ch. 6, {{ISBN|978-0486445236}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism}}
'''Ishta-Deva''' or '''Ishta Devata''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ईष्ट देवता, ''{{IAST|iṣṭa-deva(tā)}}'', literally "cherished [[Deva (Hinduism)|divinity]]" from ''iṣṭa''
"desired, liked, cherished, preferred" and ''[[devatā]]'' "godhead, divinity, [[tutelary deity]]" or ''[[deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'' "deity") is a term denoting a worshipper's favourite deity within [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;V. S. Apte, ''A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary'', p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is especially significant to both the [[Smarta]] and [[Bhakti]] schools wherein practitioners choose to worship the form of God that inspires them. Within [[Smartism]], one of [[Ishta-Deva#Formal Smarta worship|five chief deities]] are selected. Even in denominations that focus on a singular concept of God, such as [[Vaishnavism]], the Ishta Deva concept exists. For example, in [[Vaishnavism]], special focus is given to a particular form of [[Lord Vishnu]] or one of his [[Avatar]]s (i.e. [[Krishna]] or [[Rama]]), and similarly within [[Shaktism]], focus is given to a particular form of the Goddess such as [[Parvati]] or [[Lakshmi]].  The [[Swaminarayan]] sect of Vaishnavism has a similar concept, but notably holds that Vishnu and [[Shiva]] are different aspects of the same God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swaminarayansatsang.com/library/scriptures/scriptureexplanation.asp?IDProduct%3D726%26idcategory%3D2 |accessdate=25 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317164651/http://www.swaminarayansatsang.com/library/scriptures/scriptureexplanation.asp?IDProduct=726&amp;idcategory=2 |archivedate=17 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smarta worship==
The "worship of the five forms" ({{IAST|[[pañcāyatana pūjā]]}}) system, which was popularized by philosopher [[Adi Shankara|{{IAST|Śaṅkarācārya}}]] among orthodox Brahmins of the [[Smartism|Smārta]] tradition, invokes the five deities [[Ganesha]], [[Vishnu]], [[Shiva]], [[Devī]], and [[Surya|Sūrya]].&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, John A. Ganapati: Song of the Self. (State University of New York Press: Albany, 1995) p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dating for the pañcāyatana pūjā and its connection with Smārta Brahmins is from p. 163, Courtright, Paul B. {{IAST|Gaṇeśa}}: Lord of Obstacles, Lord of Beginnings. (Oxford University Press: New York, 1985). {{ISBN|0-19-505742-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This system was instituted by {{IAST|Śaṅkarācārya}} primarily to unite the principal deities of the five major sects ({{IAST|Gāṇapatya, Śaiva, Vaiṣṇava, Shakta and Saura}}) on an equal status.  The [[Monism|monistic]] philosophy preached by {{IAST|Śaṅkarācārya}} made it possible to choose one of these as a preferred principal deity and at the same time worship the other four deities as different forms of the same all-pervading [[Brahman]].

==Worship forms==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
[[File:Jhulelal hindu deity.jpg|x216px|right|thumb|[[Murti]] of Ishta Dev of Sindhi people [[Jhulelal (Hinduism)|Jhulelal]]]]
Typically a practitioner worships their Ishta-Deva through the form of a [[murti]]. This worship may involve offering items to their chosen divinity such as [[incense]] or flowers, reciting [[mantra]]s, [[bhajan|singing their names]] and offering [[prayer]]s.

Remembering the deity and internally building a relationship with (or through) them is considered essential to the practise. Within the [[Advaita]] schools it is believed that the [[human]] [[mind]] needs a concrete form to understand the divine that ultimately can never be defined. Just as one can understand the abstract concept of a [[color]] only after one has seen a concrete form, one can only realize the deity through a form of [[murti]]. In contrast, the [[Dvaita]] schools believe the Supreme Being to possess a divine form, and offer worship to their Ishta-Deva as either a representation or direct expansion of the Supreme Person. For example, [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] schools offer worship exclusively to murtis of Vishnu, or his associated avatars such as [[Krishna]] or [[Rama]].

[[Shaivism|Shaivites]] worship Shiva, either figuratively, or through his [[Lingam]] murti. As Shaivism contains both monistic and dualistic traditions either (or both) of the above approaches may be applicable.

In Hindu philosophy, '''Jagra''' is one of the four states of consciousness a man (or a being) can have. It can be roughly translated as "wakefulness". It is that part of consciousness when a person or being can sense this physical universe. Other states of consciousness are [[Swapna-marga|swapna]], [[susupti]] and [[turiya]]. Later commentators increased the states of consciousness from four to seven.

The '''Karl May Museum''' is a museum in [[Radebeul]], Germany named after the German author [[Karl May]], containing artifacts from May's life as well as from life on the [[American frontier]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] life of that era.

==Museum history==
German author [[Karl May]] (1842–1912), wrote many books about the [[American frontier]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] featuring the fictional characters [[Winnetou]] (a Mescalero-Apache Chief) and [[Old Shatterhand]] (a white European settler). Mays' books were popular in Germany and created a mystique about the "Wild West" in German popular culture.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  

The museum opened in 1928 in [[Radebeul]], in the house where May had lived, called Villa Shatterhand.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;  It was founded during a peak of interest in the US frontier and native Americans, fostered in part by the [[Sarrasani]] circus, which was headquartered in nearby [[Dresden]], and which was very popular in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=Weaver&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weaver|first1=Jace|title=Other Words: American Indian Literature, Law, and Culture|date=2001|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806133522|language=en|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQj_aQhYvfEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84}} Sarassani and Native American members of the circus came to the opening, and the Native Americans performed death songs for May.&lt;ref name=Weaver/&gt;{{rp|84}}  

The museum was founded by May's widow and an eccentric Austrian named [[:de:Patty Frank|Ernst Tobis]], who was a fan of May's work and had travelled to the American frontier, and liked to tell [[tall tales]] about his time there.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Tobis donated a large collection of artifacts to help found the museum's collection, which included 17 [[Scalping|scalps]], some of them from Native Americans.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Knight2/&gt;

When the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] took over Germany, they appropriated the museum and the image of May, and were especially focused on swastikas that appeared in some of the Native American artwork.  Hitler Youth were encouraged to visit the museum and to hear stories from Tobis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penny|first1=H. Glenn|title=Kindred by Choice: Germans and American Indians Since 1800|date=2013|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=9781469607641|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HV4DAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA166&amp;lpg=PA166|language=en|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, the original museum was in [[East Germany]] and a replica was built in [[Bamburg]] in [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name=Weaver/&gt;{{rp|73}} A person who called himself [[Chief Buffalo Child Long Lance]] became associated with the museum shortly after the war ended.&lt;ref name=Weaver/&gt;{{rp|84}} 

From 1956 to 1984, the museum in Radebul was called the "Indianer Museum", because May's books were suppressed by the East German government, in part because of the association with the Nazis, but also because the books were viewed as leading people to want to travel, which the government did not allow.&lt;ref name=NY&gt;{{cite news|last1=Galchen|first1=Rivka|title=Wild West Germany|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/04/09/wild-west-germany|work=The New Yorker|date=2 April 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Cold War]] placards in the museum in Radebeul and its displays were refactored to describe oppression of Native Americans by the US, as part of Soviet [[propaganda]] efforts to rally indigenous people against the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tóth|first1=György Ferenc|title=From Wounded Knee to Checkpoint Charlie: The Alliance for Sovereignty between American Indians and Central Europeans in the Late Cold War|date=2016|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9781438461236|pages=128ff|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fGwJDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some East Germans also did work with the [[American Indian Movement]].&lt;ref name=NY/&gt; 
[[File:Karl May Museum Skalp.jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.5|Scalp exhibited at the museum]]
The museum in Radebul was given its original name again in 1986, as the East German government moved to reclaim May. The renaming led to an exhibition focused on May in February, which had 4,000 visitors a day, and people waited for three hours outside to get in.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt;  After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, attendance at the Radebul museum dropped from around 300,000 people per year to around 60,000, as people could travel to the US instead of visiting the museum, which had been one of the only sources of information about Native Americans in East Germany.&lt;ref name=NY/&gt; 

In 2010, according to the ''South China Morning Post'', US activists began seeking [[repatriation]] of the scalps.&lt;ref name=SCMP&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1446600/karl-may-museum-under-fire-over-display-native-american-scalps | work= South China Morning Post | title= Karl May Museum under fire over display of Native American scalps |date= 11 March 2014 | accessdate= 3 May 2018 |quote= For four years, United States activists have been calling for the return of the scalps.

The '''Koopman–von Neumann mechanics''' is a description of classical mechanics in terms of [[Hilbert space]], introduced by [[Bernard Koopman]] and [[John von Neumann]] in 1931 and 1932.&lt;ref name=Koopman1931&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Koopman | first1 = B.

As Koopman and von Neumann demonstrated, a [[Hilbert space]] of [[Complex number|complex]], [[Square-integrable function|square integrable]] wavefunctions can be defined in which classical mechanics can be formulated as an operatorial theory similar to [[quantum mechanics]].

==History==
[[Statistical mechanics]] describes macroscopic systems in terms of [[Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|statistical ensembles]], such as the macroscopic properties of an [[ideal gas]].  Ergodic theory is a branch of mathematics arising from the study of statistical mechanics.

===Ergodic theory===
The origins of Koopman–von Neumann (KvN) theory are tightly connected with the rise{{when|date=October 2016}} of [[ergodic theory]] as an independent branch of mathematics, in particular with [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann's]] [[ergodic hypothesis]].

In 1931 Koopman and [[André Weil]] independently observed that the phase space of the classical system can be converted into a Hilbert space by postulating a natural integration rule over the points of the phase space as the definition of the scalar product, and that this transformation allows drawing of interesting conclusions about the evolution of physical observables from [[Stone's theorem on one-parameter unitary groups|Stone's theorem]], which had been proved shortly before. This finding inspired von Neumann to apply the novel formalism to the ergodic problem. Already in 1932 he completed the operator reformulation of quantum mechanics currently known as Koopman–von Neumann theory. Subsequently, he published several seminal results in modern ergodic theory including the proof of his [[Ergodic theory#Mean ergodic theorem|mean ergodic theorem]]''.

==Definition and dynamics==

===Derivation starting from the Liouville equation===
In the approach of Koopman and von Neumann ('''KvN'''), dynamics in [[phase space]] is described by a (classical) probability density, recovered from an underlying wavefunction – the Koopman–von Neumann wavefunction – as the square of its absolute value (more precisely, as the amplitude multiplied with its own [[complex conjugate]]). This stands in analogy to the [[Born rule]] in quantum mechanics. In the KvN framework, observables are represented by commuting self-adjoint operators acting on the [[Hilbert space]] of KvN wavefunctions. The commutativity physically implies that all observables are simultaneously measurable. Contrast this with quantum mechanics, where observables need not commute, which underlines the [[uncertainty principle]], [[Kochen–Specker theorem]], and [[Bell inequalities]].&lt;ref name=Landau1987&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Landau | first1 = L.

The KvN wavefunction is postulated to evolve according to exactly the same [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville equation]] as the classical probability density. From this postulate it can be shown that indeed probability density dynamics is recovered.

&lt;div class="NavContent" style="text-align:left;"&gt;

In classical statistical mechanics, the probability density obeys the Liouville equation&lt;ref name=DaniloMauro2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mauro2002/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rho (x, p, t) = \hat{L} \rho(x, p, t)&lt;/math&gt;
with the self-adjoint Liouvillian
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{L} = - i\frac{\partial H(x, p)}{\partial p}  \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + i\frac{\partial H(x, p)}{\partial x} \frac{\partial}{\partial p},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; H(x,p) &lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|classical Hamiltonian]].
The same dynamical equation is postulated for the KvN wavefunction
:&lt;math&gt;i\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi (x, p, t) = \hat{L} \psi (x, p, t),&lt;/math&gt;
thus
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi(x, p, t) = \left[- \frac{\partial H(x, p)}{\partial p}  \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial H(x, p)}{\partial x} \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \right] \psi(x, p, t),&lt;/math&gt;
and for its complex conjugate
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi^*(x, p, t) = \left[- \frac{\partial H(x, p)}{\partial p}  \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial H(x, p)}{\partial x} \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \right] \psi^*(x, p, t).&lt;/math&gt;
From
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(x, p, t) = \psi^*(x, p, t) \psi(x, p, t)&lt;/math&gt;
follows using the [[Product rule#Higher partial derivatives|product rule]] that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rho(x, p, t) = \left[- \frac{\partial H(x, p)}{\partial p}  \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial H(x, p)}{\partial x} \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \right] \rho(x, p, t)&lt;/math&gt;
which proves that probability density dynamics can be recovered from the KvN wavefunction.

;Remark:
The last step of this derivation relies on the classical Liouville operator containing only first-order derivatives in the coordinate and momentum; this is not the case in quantum mechanics where the [[Schrödinger equation]] contains second-order derivatives.

&lt;/div&gt;

===Derivation starting from operator axioms===
Conversely, it is possible to start from operator postulates, similar to the [[Operator (physics)#Operators in quantum mechanics|Hilbert space axioms of quantum mechanics]], and derive the equation of motion by specifying how expectation values evolve.&lt;ref name=Bondar2012&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bondar | first1 = D. | last2 = Cabrera | first2 = R. | last3 = Lompay | first3 = R. | last4 = Ivanov | first4 = M. | last5 = Rabitz | first5 = H. | title = Operational Dynamic Modeling Transcending Quantum and Classical Mechanics | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.190403 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 109 | issue = 19 | year = 2012 | pmid =  23215365| pmc = |arxiv = 1105.4014 |bibcode = 2012PhRvL.109s0403B | pages=190403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevant axioms are that as in quantum mechanics (i) the states of a system are represented by normalized vectors of a complex Hilbert space, and the observables are given by [[self-adjoint operator]]s acting on that space, (ii) the expectation value of an observable is obtained in the manner as the [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)#Formalism in quantum mechanics|expectation value in quantum mechanics]], (iii) the probabilities of measuring certain values of some observables are calculated by the [[Born rule]], and (iv) the state space of a composite system is the [[tensor product]] of the subsystem's spaces.

&lt;div style="clear:both;width:75%;" class="NavFrame expanded"&gt;
&lt;div class="NavHead" style="background-color:#CCCCFF; text-align:left; font-size:larger;"&gt;{{anchor|sec_formulation}}Mathematical form of the operator axioms&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="NavContent" style="text-align:left;"&gt;
The above axioms (i) to (iv), with the [[inner product]] written in the [[bra–ket notation]], are
:(i) &lt;math&gt; \langle \psi(t) | \psi(t) \rangle = 1&lt;/math&gt;,
:(ii) The expectation value of an observable &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\langle A (t)\rangle =  \langle \Psi (t)| \hat{A} | \Psi(t) \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;
:(iii)  The probability that a measurement of an observable &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; \left|\langle A | \Psi(t)\rangle \right|^2 &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \hat{A} |A\rangle = A |A \rangle &lt;/math&gt;. (This axiom is an analogue of the [[Born rule]] in quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name=Brumer2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brumer | first1 = P. | last2 = Gong | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.73.052109 | title = Born rule in quantum and classical mechanics | journal = Physical Review A | volume = 73 | issue = 5 | pages = 052109 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = quant-ph/0604178 |bibcode = 2006PhRvA..73e2109B | hdl = 1807/16870 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)
:(iv) (see [[Tensor product of Hilbert spaces#Definition|Tensor product of Hilbert spaces]]).
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

These axioms allow us to recover the formalism of both classical and quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name=Bondar2012/&gt; Specifically, under the assumption that the classical position and momentum operators [[Commutative property|commute]], the Liouville equation for the KvN wavefunction is recovered from averaged [[Newton's laws of motion]]. However, if the coordinate and momentum obey the [[canonical commutation relation]], the [[Schrödinger equation]] of quantum mechanics is obtained.

&lt;div style="clear:both;width:75%;" class="NavFrame expanded"&gt;
&lt;div class="NavHead" style="background-color:#CCCCFF; text-align:left; font-size:larger;"&gt;{{anchor|sec_KvN_from_Newton}}Classical mechanics from the [[#sec_formulation|operator axioms]] (derivation)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="NavContent" style="text-align:left;"&gt;
We begin from the following equations for expectation values of the coordinate ''x'' and momentum ''p''
:&lt;math&gt;
m\frac{d}{dt} \langle x \rangle = \langle p \rangle, \qquad \frac{d}{dt} \langle p \rangle =\langle -U'(x) \rangle,
&lt;/math&gt;
aka, [[Newton's laws of motion]] averaged over ensemble. With the help of the [[#sec_formulation|operator axioms]], they can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
m\frac{d}{dt} \langle \Psi(t) | \hat{x} | \Psi(t) \rangle &amp;= \langle \Psi(t) | \hat{p} | \Psi(t) \rangle, \\
\frac{d}{dt} \langle \Psi(t) | \hat{p} | \Psi(t) \rangle &amp;= \langle \Psi(t) | -U'(\hat{x}) | \Psi(t) \rangle.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Notice a close resemblance with [[Ehrenfest theorem]]s in quantum mechanics. Applications of the [[product rule]] leads to
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\langle d\Psi/dt | \hat{x} | \Psi \rangle + \langle \Psi | \hat{x} | d\Psi/dt \rangle &amp;= \langle \Psi | \hat{p}/m | \Psi \rangle, \\
	\langle d\Psi/dt | \hat{p} | \Psi \rangle  + \langle \Psi | \hat{p} | d\Psi/dt \rangle &amp; = \langle \Psi | -U'(\hat{x}) | \Psi \rangle,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
into which we substitute a consequence of [[Stone's theorem on one-parameter unitary groups|Stone's theorem]] &lt;math&gt; i | d\Psi(t)/dt \rangle = \hat{L} | \Psi(t) \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and obtain
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
im \langle \Psi(t) | [\hat{L}, \hat{x} ] | \Psi(t) \rangle &amp;= \langle \Psi(t)| \hat{p} |\Psi(t)\rangle,  \\
i \langle \Psi(t) | [\hat{L}, \hat{p}] | \Psi(t)\rangle &amp;= - \langle \Psi(t)| U'(\hat{x}) |\Psi(t)\rangle.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Since these identities must be valid for any initial state, the averaging can be dropped and the  system of commutator equations for the unknown &lt;math&gt;\hat{L}&lt;/math&gt; is derived
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
	im  [\hat{L}, \hat{x}] =  \hat{p} , \qquad i [\hat{L}, \hat{p}] = -U'(\hat{x}).
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|commutator eqs for L}}}}
'''Assume that the coordinate and momentum commute &lt;math&gt;[ \hat{x}, \hat{p} ] = 0&lt;/math&gt;.''' This assumption physically means that the classical particle's coordinate and momentum can be measured simultaneously, implying absence of the [[uncertainty principle]].

The solution &lt;math&gt;\hat{L}&lt;/math&gt; cannot be simply of the form &lt;math&gt;\hat{L} = L(\hat{x}, \hat{p})&lt;/math&gt; because it would imply the contractions &lt;math&gt; im  [L(\hat{x}, \hat{p}), \hat{x}] =  0 = \hat{p} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; i [L(\hat{x}, \hat{p}), \hat{p}] = 0 = -U'(\hat{x}) &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, we must utilize additional operators &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda}_p&lt;/math&gt; obeying
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
	[ \hat{x}, \hat{\lambda}_x ] = [ \hat{p}, \hat{\lambda}_p ] = i, \quad [\hat{x}, \hat{p}] = [ \hat{x}, \hat{\lambda}_p ] =  [ \hat{p}, \hat{\lambda}_x ] = [ \hat{\lambda}_x, \hat{\lambda}_p ] = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|KvN algebra}}}}
The need to employ these auxiliary operators arises because all classical observables commute. Now we seek &lt;math&gt;\hat{L}&lt;/math&gt; in the form &lt;math&gt;\hat{L} = L(\hat{x}, \hat{\lambda}_x, \hat{p}, \hat{\lambda}_p)&lt;/math&gt;. Utilizing {{EquationNote|KvN algebra}}, the {{EquationNote|commutator eqs for L}} can be converted into the following differential equations
:&lt;ref name=Bondar2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Transtrum2005&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Transtrum | first1 = M. K. | last2 = Van Huele | first2 = J. F. O.

:&lt;math&gt;
m L'_{\lambda_x} (x, \lambda_x, p, \lambda_p) = p, \qquad L'_{\lambda_p} (x, \lambda_x, p, \lambda_p) = -U'(x).
&lt;/math&gt;
Whence, we conclude that the classical KvN wave function &lt;math&gt;|\Psi(t)\rangle&lt;/math&gt; evolves according to the  [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger-like]] equation of motion
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
	i\frac{d}{dt} |\Psi(t)\rangle = \hat{L} |\Psi(t)\rangle,
\qquad \hat{L} = \frac{\hat{p}}{m} \hat{\lambda}_x  - U'(\hat{x}) \hat{\lambda}_p.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|KvN dynamical eq}}}}

Let us explicitly show that {{EquationNote|KvN dynamical eq}} is equivalent to the [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)#Liouville equations|classical Liouville mechanics]].

Since &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}&lt;/math&gt; commute, they share the common [[eigenvectors]]
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\hat{x} |x,p\rangle = x |x,p\rangle, \quad \hat{p} |x,p\rangle = p |x,p\rangle , \quad
A(\hat{x}, \hat{p}) |x,p\rangle = A(x,p) |x,p\rangle,
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|xp eigenvec}}}}
with the [[Self-adjoint operator#Resolution of the identity|resolution of the identity]]
&lt;math&gt;
1 = \int dx dp \, |x,p\rangle \langle x,p|.
&lt;/math&gt;
Then, one obtains from equation ({{EquationNote|KvN algebra}})
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle x,p| \hat{\lambda}_x | \Psi \rangle =  -i \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \langle x,p | \Psi \rangle, \qquad
\langle x,p| \hat{\lambda}_p | \Psi \rangle =  -i \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \langle x,p | \Psi \rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;
Projecting equation ({{EquationNote|KvN dynamical eq}}) onto &lt;math&gt;\langle x,p|&lt;/math&gt;, we get the equation of motion for the KvN wave function in the xp-representation
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\left[ \frac{\partial }{\partial t} + \frac{p}{m} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} -  U'(x) \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \right]  \langle x,p | \Psi(t) \rangle = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|KvN dynamical eq in xp}}}}
The quantity &lt;math&gt;\langle x,\, p |\Psi(t) \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the probability amplitude for a classical particle to be at point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with momentum &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. According to the [[#sec_formulation|axioms above]], the probability density is given by
&lt;math&gt;\rho(x,p;t) = \left| \langle x, p |\Psi(t) \rangle \right|^2&lt;/math&gt;. Utilizing the identity
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial }{\partial t} \rho(x,p;t) = \langle \Psi(t) | x, p \rangle \frac{\partial }{\partial t} \langle x, p |\Psi(t) \rangle
+ \langle x, p |\Psi(t) \rangle \left( \frac{\partial }{\partial t}  \langle x, p |\Psi(t) \rangle \right)^*
&lt;/math&gt;
as well as ({{EquationNote|KvN dynamical eq in xp}}), we recover the classical Liouville equation
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\left[ \frac{\partial }{\partial t} + \frac{p}{m} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} -  U'(x) \frac{\partial}{\partial p}  \right]  \rho(x,p;t) = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Liouville eq}}}}

Moreover, according to the [[#sec_formulation|operator axioms]] and ({{EquationNote|xp eigenvec}}),
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\langle A \rangle  &amp;=  \langle \Psi (t)| A(\hat{x}, \hat{p}) | \Psi(t) \rangle
= \int dxdp \, \langle \Psi (t)| x,p\rangle A(x, p) \langle x,p | \Psi(t) \rangle \\
&amp; = \int dxdp \,  A(x, p) \langle \Psi (t)| x,p\rangle \langle x,p | \Psi(t) \rangle
= \int dxdp \,  A(x, p) \rho(x,p;t).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the rule for calculating averages of observable &lt;math&gt; A(x,p) &lt;/math&gt; in classical statistical mechanics has been recovered from the [[#sec_formulation|operator axioms]] with the additional assumption &lt;math&gt;[ \hat{x}, \hat{p} ] = 0&lt;/math&gt;. As a result, the phase of a classical wave function does not contribute to observable averages. Contrary to quantum mechanics, the phase of a KvN wave function is physically irrelevant.

As in the [[#sec_KvN_from_Newton|derivation of classical mechanics]], we begin from the following equations for averages of coordinate ''x'' and momentum ''p''
:&lt;math&gt;
m\frac{d}{dt} \langle x \rangle = \langle p \rangle, \qquad \frac{d}{dt} \langle p \rangle =\langle -U'(x) \rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;
With the help of the [[#sec_formulation|operator axioms]], they can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
m\frac{d}{dt} \langle \Psi(t) | \hat{x} | \Psi(t) \rangle &amp;= \langle \Psi(t) | \hat{p} | \Psi(t) \rangle, \\
\frac{d}{dt} \langle \Psi(t) | \hat{p} | \Psi(t) \rangle &amp;= \langle \Psi(t) | -U'(\hat{x}) | \Psi(t) \rangle.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
These are the [[Ehrenfest theorem]]s in quantum mechanics. Applications of the [[product rule]] leads to
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\langle d\Psi/dt | \hat{x} | \Psi \rangle + \langle \Psi | \hat{x} | d\Psi/dt \rangle &amp;= \langle \Psi | \hat{p}/m | \Psi \rangle, \\
	\langle d\Psi/dt | \hat{p} | \Psi \rangle  + \langle \Psi | \hat{p} | d\Psi/dt \rangle &amp; = \langle \Psi | -U'(\hat{x}) | \Psi \rangle,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
into which we substitute a consequence of [[Stone's theorem on one-parameter unitary groups|Stone's theorem]]
:&lt;math&gt;
i\hbar | d \Psi(t)/dt \rangle = \hat{H} | \Psi(t) \rangle,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; was introduced as a normalization constant to balance dimensionality. Since these identities must be valid for any initial state, the averaging can be dropped and the system of commutator equations for the unknown quantum generator of motion &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt; are derived
:&lt;math&gt;
im [\hat{H}, \hat{x}] = \hbar \hat{p}, \qquad i [\hat{H}, \hat{p}] = -\hbar U'(\hat{x}).
&lt;/math&gt;
Contrary to the case of [[#sec_KvN_from_Newton|classical mechanics]], we '''assume that observables of the coordinate and momentum obey the [[canonical commutation relation]]''' &lt;math&gt;[ \hat{x}, \hat{p} ] = i\hbar&lt;/math&gt;. Setting &lt;math&gt;\hat{H} = H(\hat{x}, \hat{p})&lt;/math&gt;, the commutator equations can be converted into the differential equations

whose solution is the familiar [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|quantum Hamiltonian]]
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{H} = \frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m} + U(\hat{x}).
&lt;/math&gt;
Whence, the [[Schrödinger equation]] was derived from the Ehrenfest theorems by assuming the canonical commutation relation between the coordinate and momentum. This derivation as well as the [[#sec_KvN_from_Newton|derivation of classical KvN mechanics]] shows that the difference between quantum and classical mechanics essentially boils down to the value of the commutator &lt;math&gt;[ \hat{x}, \hat{p} ]&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

===Measurements===
In the Hilbert space and operator formulation of classical mechanics, the Koopman von Neumann–wavefunction takes the form of a superposition of eigenstates, and measurement collapses the KvN wavefunction to the eigenstate which is associated the measurement result, in analogy to the [[wave function collapse]] of quantum mechanics.

However, it can be shown that for Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics ''non-selective measurements'' leave the KvN wavefunction unchanged.&lt;ref name=DaniloMauro2002/&gt;

==KvN vs Liouville mechanics==

The KvN dynamical equation ({{EquationNote|KvN dynamical eq in xp}}) and [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)#Liouville equations|Liouville equation]] ({{EquationNote|Liouville eq}}) are [[first-order partial differential equation|first-order linear partial differential equations]]. One recovers [[Newton's laws of motion]] by applying the [[method of characteristics]] to either of these equations. Hence, the key difference between KvN and Liouville mechanics lies in weighting individual trajectories: Arbitrary weights, underlying the classical wave function, can be utilized in the KvN mechanics, while only positive weights, representing the probability density, are permitted in the Liouville mechanics (see [[#fig_KvN_vs_Liouville|this scheme]]).

[[File:KvN vs Liouville mechanics.pdf|thumb|350px|center|{{anchor|fig_KvN_vs_Liouville}}The essential distinction between KvN and Liouville mechanics lies in weighting (coloring) individual trajectories: Any weights can be utilized in KvN mechanics, while only positive weights are allowed in Liouville mechanics. Particles move along Newtonian trajectories in both cases. ([[#animation_KvN_for_Morse|Regarding a dynamical example, see below.]])]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19936">In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], the '''Krohn–Rhodes theory''' (or '''algebraic automata theory''') is an approach to the study of finite [[semigroup]]s and [[automata theory|automata]] that seeks to decompose them in terms of elementary components. These components correspond to finite [[aperiodic semigroup]]s and finite [[simple groups]] that are combined together in a feedback-free manner (called a "[[wreath product]]" or "cascade").

Krohn and [[John Rhodes (mathematician)|Rhodes]] found a general decomposition for [[finite automata]]. In doing their research, though, the authors discovered and proved an unexpected major result in finite semigroup theory, revealing a deep connection between finite automata and semigroups.

==Definitions and description of the Krohn–Rhodes theorem  {{anchor|Description of the Krohn–Rhodes theorem}} ==
A [[semigroup]] ''S'' that is a [[homomorphic]] image of a [[subsemigroup]] of ''T'' is said to be a '''divisor''' of ''T''.

The '''Krohn–Rhodes theorem for finite semigroups''' states that every finite semigroup ''S'' is a divisor of a finite alternating [[wreath product]] of finite [[simple group]]s, each a divisor of ''S'', and finite [[aperiodic semigroup]]s (which contain no nontrivial [[subgroup]]s).&lt;ref name=Hol142&gt;Holcombe (1982) pp. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt;

In the automata formulation, the '''Krohn–Rhodes theorem for finite automata'''  states that given a [[finite automaton]] ''A'' with states ''Q'' and input set ''I'', output alphabet ''U'', then one can expand the states to ''Q' '' such that the new automaton ''A' '' embeds into a cascade of "simple", irreducible automata: In particular, ''A'' is emulated by a feed-forward cascade of  (1) automata whose transitions semigroups are  [[finite simple groups]] and (2) automata which are banks of [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]]s running in parallel.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The flip-flop is the two-state automaton with three input operations: the identity (which leaves its state unchanged) and the two reset operations (which overwrite the current state by a resetting to a particular one of the two states). This can be considered a one-[[bit]] read-write storage unit: the identity corresponds to reading the bit (while leaving its value unaltered), and the two resets to setting the value of the bit to 0 or 1. Note that a reset is an irreversible operator as it destroys the currently stored bit value.  NB: The semigroup of the flip-flop and all its subsemigroups are irreducible.&lt;/ref&gt; The new automaton ''A' ''     has the same input and output symbols as ''A''. Here, both the states and inputs of the cascaded automata have a very special hierarchical coordinate form.

Moreover, each simple group (''prime'') or non-group irreducible semigroup (subsemigroup of the [[semigroup with three elements|flip-flop monoid]]) that divides the transformation semigroup of ''A'' must divide the transition semigroup of some component of the cascade, and only the primes that must occur as divisors of the components are those that divide ''A'' 's transition semigroup.

==Group complexity==
The '''Krohn–Rhodes complexity''' (also called '''group complexity''' or just '''[[complexity]]''') of a finite semigroup ''S'' is the least number of groups in a [[wreath product]] of finite groups and finite aperiodic semigroups of which ''S'' is a divisor.

All finite aperiodic semigroups have complexity 0, while non-[[trivial (mathematics)|trivial]] finite groups have complexity 1. In fact, there are semigroups of every non-negative [[integer]] complexity. For example, for any ''n'' greater than 1, the multiplicative semigroup of all (''n''+1)×(''n''+1) upper triangular [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over any fixed finite [[field (mathematics)|field]] has complexity ''n'' (Kambites, 2007).

A major open problem in finite semigroup theory is the ''decidability of complexity'': is there an [[algorithm]] that will compute the Krohn–Rhodes complexity of a finite semigroup, given its [[multiplication table]]?
Upper bounds and ever more precise lower bounds on complexity have been obtained (see, e.g. Rhodes &amp; Steinberg, 2009).   Rhodes has conjectured that the problem is decidable.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;J.  Rhodes, Keynote talk at the International Conference on Semigroups &amp; Algebraic Engineering (Aizu, Japan), 26 March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and applications==
At a conference in 1962, [[Kenneth Krohn]] and [[John Rhodes (mathematician)|John Rhodes]] announced a method for decomposing a [[Deterministic finite automaton|(deterministic) finite automaton]] into "simple" components that are themselves finite automata.  This joint work, which has implications for philosophy, comprised both Krohn's doctoral thesis at [[Harvard University]], and Rhodes' doctoral thesis at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;[[Morris Hirsch|Morris W. Hirsch]], "Foreword to Rhodes' ''Applications of Automata Theory and Algebra''".  In J. Rhodes, ''Applications of Automata Theory and Algebra: Via the Mathematical Theory of Complexity to Biology, Physics, Philosophy  and Games", (ed. C. L. Nehaniv), World Scientific Publishing Co.,  2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Simpler proofs, and generalizations of the theorem to infinite structures, have been published since then (see Chapter 4 of Steinberg and Rhodes' 2009 book ''The'' q-''Theory of Finite Semigroups'' for an overview).

In the 1965 paper by Krohn and Rhodes, the proof of the theorem on the decomposition of finite automata (or, equivalently [[sequential machines]]) made extensive use of the algebraic [[semigroup]] structure.  Later proofs contained major simplifications using finite [[wreath product]]s of finite transformation semigroups. The theorem generalizes the [[Jordan–Hölder decomposition]] for finite groups (in which the primes are the finite simple groups), to all finite transformation semigroups (for which the primes are again the finite simple groups plus all subsemigroups of the "flip-flop" (see above)). Both the group and more general finite automata decomposition require expanding the state-set of the general, but allow for the same number of input symbols. In the general case, these are embedded in a larger structure with a hierarchical "coordinate system".

One must be careful in understanding the notion of "prime" as Krohn and Rhodes explicitly refer to their theorem as a "prime decomposition theorem" for automata. The components in the decomposition, however, are not prime automata (with ''prime'' defined in a naïve way); rather, the notion of ''prime'' is more sophisticated and algebraic: the semigroups and groups associated to the constituent automata of the decomposition are prime (or irreducible) in a strict and natural algebraic sense with respect to the wreath product (Eilenberg, 1976). Also, unlike earlier decomposition theorems, the Krohn–Rhodes decompositions usually require expansion of the state-set, so that the expanded automaton covers (emulates) the one being decomposed. These facts have made the theorem difficult to understand, and challenging to apply in a practical way—until recently, when computational implementations became available (Egri-Nagy &amp; Nehaniv 2005, 2008).

H.P. Zeiger (1967) proved an important variant called the '''holonomy decomposition''' (Eilenberg  1976).&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Eilenberg 1976, as well as Dömösi and Nehaniv, 2005, present proofs that correct an error in Zeiger's paper.&lt;/ref&gt;  The holonomy method appears to be relatively efficient and has been implemented computationally by A. Egri-Nagy (Egri-Nagy &amp; Nehaniv 2005).

Meyer and Thompson (1969) give a version of Krohn–Rhodes decomposition for finite automata that is equivalent to the decomposition previously developed by Hartmanis and Stearns, but for useful decompositions, the notion of ''expanding'' the state-set of the original automaton is essential (for the non-permutation automata case).

Many proofs and constructions now exist of Krohn–Rhodes decompositions (e.g., [Krohn, Rhodes &amp; Tilson 1968], [Ésik 2000], [Diekert et al. 2012]), with the holonomy method the most popular and efficient in general (although not in all cases). Due to the close relation between monoids and categories, a version of the Krohn–Rhodes theorem is applicable to [[category theory]]. This observation and a proof of an analogous result were offered by Wells (1980).&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;See also (Tilson 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Krohn–Rhodes theorem for semigroups/monoids is an analogue of the [[Jordan–Hölder theorem]] for finite groups (for semigroups/monoids rather than groups). As such, the theorem is a deep and important result in semigroup/monoid theory. The theorem was also surprising to many mathematicians and computer scientists&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;C.L. Nehaniv, Preface to (Rhodes, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; since it had previously been widely believed that the semigroup/monoid axioms were too weak to admit a structure theorem of any strength, and prior work (Hartmanis &amp; Stearns) was only able to show much more rigid and less general decomposition results for finite automata.

Work by Egri-Nagy and Nehaniv (2005, 2008–) continues to further automate the holonomy version of the Krohn–Rhodes decomposition extended with the related decomposition for finite groups (so-called [[Frobenius–Lagrange coordinates]]) using the [[computer algebra system]] [[GAP computer algebra system|GAP]].

Applications outside of the semigroup and monoid theories are now computationally feasible.  They include computations in [[biology]] and biochemical systems (e.g. Egri-Nagy &amp; Nehaniv 2008), [[artificial intelligence]], finite-state [[physics]], [[psychology]], and [[game theory]] (see, for example, Rhodes 2009).

'''Lemaître coordinates''' are a particular set of coordinates for the [[Schwarzschild metric]]&amp;mdash;a spherically symmetric solution to the [[Einstein field equations]] in a vacuum&amp;mdash;introduced by [[Georges Lemaître]] in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=G.

==The Lemaître coordinates ==

The original Schwarzschild coordinate expression of the Schwarzschild metric, in [[natural units]] ({{nowrap|1=''[[speed of light|c]]'' = ''[[Gravitational constant|G]]'' = 1}}), is given as
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2=\left(1-{r_s\over r}\right)dt^2-{dr^2\over 1-{r_s\over r}} - r^2\left(d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta d\phi^2\right) \;,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2&lt;/math&gt; is the [[invariant interval]];
:&lt;math&gt;r_s=2M&lt;/math&gt; is the Schwarzschild radius;
:&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the central body;
:&lt;math&gt;t, r, \theta, \phi&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Schwarzschild coordinates]] (which asymptotically turn into the flat [[spherical coordinates]]);
:&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]];
:and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]].

This metric has a coordinate singularity at the Schwarzschild radius &lt;math&gt;r=r_s&lt;/math&gt;.

Georges Lemaître was the first to show that this is not a real physical singularity but simply a manifestation of the fact that the static Schwarzschild coordinates cannot be realized with material bodies inside the Schwarzschild radius. Indeed, inside the Schwarzschild radius everything falls towards the centre and it is impossible for a physical body to keep a constant radius.

A transformation of the Schwarzschild coordinate system from &lt;math&gt;\{t,r\}&lt;/math&gt; to the new coordinates &lt;math&gt;\{\tau,\rho\},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
d\tau = dt + \sqrt{\frac{r_{s}}{r}}\,\left(1-\frac{r_{s}}{r}\right)^{-1}dr~\\
d\rho = dt + \sqrt{\frac{r}{r_{s}}}\,\left(1-\frac{r_{s}}{r}\right)^{-1}dr~
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
(notice that the numerator and denominator are switched inside the square-roots), leads to the Lemaître coordinate expression of the metric,
:&lt;math&gt;
ds^{2} = d\tau^{2} - \frac{r_{s}}{r} d\rho^{2}
- r^{2}(d\theta^{2} +\sin^{2}\theta
d\phi^{2})
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
r=\left[\frac{3}{2}(\rho-\tau)\right]^{2/3}r_{s}^{1/3} \;.
&lt;/math&gt;
The trajectories with ''ρ'' constant are [[Schwarzschild geodesics|timelike geodesics]] with ''τ'' the proper time along these geodesics. They represent the motion of freely falling particles which start out with zero velocity at infinity. At any point their speed is just equal to the escape velocity from that point.

In Lemaître coordinates there is no singularity at the Schwarzschild radius, which instead corresponds to the point &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{2}(\rho-\tau)=r_s&lt;/math&gt;. However, there remains a genuine [[gravitational singularity]] at the center, where &lt;math&gt;\rho-\tau=0&lt;/math&gt;, which cannot be removed by a coordinate change.

The Lemaître coordinate system is [[Synchronous coordinates|synchronous]], that is, the global time coordinate of the metric defines the proper time of co-moving observers. The radially falling bodies reach the Schwarzschild radius and the centre within finite proper time.

Along the trajectory of a radial light ray,
:&lt;math&gt;
dr=\left(\pm 1 - \sqrt{r_s\over r}\right)d\tau ,
&lt;/math&gt;
therefore no signal can escape from inside the Schwarzschild radius, where always
&lt;math&gt;dr&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; and the light rays emitted radially inwards and outwards both
end up at the origin.

The '''lesser of two evils principle''' (or '''lesser evil principle''' and '''lesser-evilism''') is the principle that when faced with selecting from two immoral options, the one which is least immoral should be chosen.

== In modern elections ==
In 2012, ''[[Huffington Post]]'' columnist Sanford Jay Rosen stated that the idea became a common practice for left-leaning voters in the [[United States]] due to their overwhelming disapproval of the United States government's support for the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=hufevil&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sanford-jay-rosen/obama-reelection_b_1913745.html|author=Stanford Jay Rosen|title=Don't Get Fooled Again: Why Liberals and Progressives Should Vote Enthusiastically for President Obama|publisher=Huffington Post|date=2012-09-25|accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosen stated: "Beginning with the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential election]], I often have heard from liberals that they could not vote for the lesser of two evils. Some said they would not vote; some said they would vote for a third party candidate. That mantra delivered us to Richard Nixon in [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972]] until Watergate did him in. And it delivered us to [[George W. Bush]] and [[Dick Cheney]] in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] until they were termed out in 2009".&lt;ref name=hufevil /&gt; Opponents of the modern usage of these terms in reference to [[electoral politics]] include [[revolutionaries]] who oppose the existing system as a whole as well as political moderates who advocate that [[Third party (politics)|third parties]] be given greater exposure in that system. For a particular voter in an election with more than two candidates, if the voter believes the most preferred candidate cannot win, the voter may be tempted to vote for the most favored viable candidate as a [[necessary evil]] or the lesser of two evils.

Supporters of lesser-evil tactics in the United States often cite United States politician [[Ralph Nader's presidential campaigns]] as examples of what can happen when a third-party candidate receives a significant number of votes. They claim that the mere existence of the third-party candidate essentially steals votes ("tilts" or "tips the scales") from the more progressive of the two main candidates and puts the election in favor of the "worse" candidate—because the small percentage that goes towards the third party candidate is a part "wasted" that could have instead gone to the lesser-evil candidate. For example, as the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] candidate in [[Ralph Nader presidential campaign, 2000|2000]], Nader garnered 2.7% of the popular vote and as a result is considered by some Democrats to have tipped the election to Bush. One counterargument is that Nader's candidacy likely increased turnout among liberals and that [[Al Gore]] took four of the five states—and thirty of the fifty-five electoral college votes—in which the outcome was decided by less than one percent of the vote. Others argue that supporters of Nader and other third party candidates draw from voters who would not vote for either Democrats or Republicans.

In the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]], both major candidates of the major parties—[[Hillary Clinton]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]) and [[Donald Trump]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]])—had a disapproval rating close to 60% by August 31, 2016.&lt;ref name=washpostdislike&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/31/a-record-number-of-americans-now-dislike-hillary-clinton/|author=Aaron Blake|title=A record number of Americans now dislike Hillary Clinton|publisher=Washington Post|date=2016-08-31|accessdate=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green Party candidate [[Jill Stein]] invoked this idea in her campaign in her slogan "Don't vote for the lesser evil, fight for the greater good". 

In elections between only two candidates where one is mildly unpopular and the other immensely unpopular, opponents of both candidates frequently advocate a vote for the mildly unpopular candidate. For example, in the second round of the [[French presidential election, 2002|2002 French presidential election]] graffiti in Paris told people to "vote for the crook, not the fascist". The "crook" in those scribbled public messages was [[Jacques Chirac]] of [[Rally for the Republic]] and the "fascist" was [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] of the [[National Front (France)|National Front]]. Chirac eventually won the second round having garnered 82% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/1109370 |title=Chirac’s new challenge |publisher=The Economist |date=2002-05-06 |accessdate=2011-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2017|2017 Hong Kong Chief Executive election]], the "lesser evil" debate rose within the [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pro-democracy camp]] as the pro-democrats did not field any candidate in order to make use of their votes in the Beijing-dominated [[Election Committee]] to boost the chance for an alternative establishment candidate. Some pro-democrats inclined to support [[John Tsang]], a relatively moderate [[pro-Beijing camp|pro-establishment]] candidate to prevent a perceived hardliner [[Carrie Lam]] from winning. Radical pro-democracy legislator [[Leung Kwok-hung]] refuted the "lesser evil" strategy, thinking it would cost the pro-democrats' moral high ground and announced his own candidacy in order to persuade the pro-democrat electors from voting for Tsang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Long Hair’ Leung Kwok-hung enters chief executive race, urging allies not to vote for ‘lesser evils’|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/2069091/long-hair-leung-kwok-hung-enters-ce-race-urging-allies-not-vote|date=8 February 2017|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
"[[Between Scylla and Charybdis]]" is an idiom derived from [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''. In the story, [[Odysseus]] chose to go near [[Scylla]] as the lesser of two evils. He lost six of his companions, but if he had gone near [[Charybdis]] all would be doomed. Because of such stories, having to navigate between the two hazards eventually entered idiomatic use. Another equivalent English seafaring phrase is "Between a rock and a hard place".&lt;ref&gt;Definition from the ''Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English'' [http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/Scylla-and-Charybdis available online]&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin line ''incidit in scyllam cupiens vitare charybdim'' ("he runs into Scylla, wishing to avoid Charybdis") had earlier become proverbial, with a meaning much the same as [[jumping from the frying pan into the fire]]. [[Erasmus]] recorded it as an ancient proverb in his ''[[Adagia]]'', although the earliest known instance is in the ''[[Alexandreis]]'', a 12th-century Latin [[epic poetry|epic poem]] by [[Walter of Châtillon]].&lt;ref&gt;Noted by [[Edward Charles Harington]] in [https://books.google.com/books?id=7mIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA10 ''Notes and Queries'' 5th Series, '''8''' (7 July 1877:14)].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lunar orbit rendezvous''' ('''LOR''') is a key concept for efficiently landing humans on the Moon and returning them to Earth. It was utilized for the [[Project Apollo]] missions in the 1960s and 1970s. In a LOR mission, a main [[spacecraft]] and a smaller lunar lander travel to [[lunar orbit]]. The lunar lander then independently descends to the surface of the Moon, while the main spacecraft remains in lunar orbit. After completion of the mission there, the lander returns to lunar orbit to [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] and re-[[docking and berthing of spacecraft|dock]] with the main spacecraft, then is discarded after transfer of crew and payload. Only the main spacecraft returns to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|vB7AA7B9hTI|"Lunar Orbit Rendezvous" - 1968 - NASA Mission Planning and Analysis Division}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LOR Gravity Well.png|thumb|Representation of the lunar [[gravity well]], illustrating how resources needed only for the trip home don't have to be carried down and back up the "well"]]
Lunar orbit rendezvous was first known to be proposed in 1919 by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] engineer [[Yuri Kondratyuk]],{{sfnp|Harvey|2007|p=6—7}} as the most economical way of sending a human on a round-trip journey to the Moon.{{sfnp|Wilford|1969|p=41-48}}

[[File:Shuttleclunar.svg|thumb|LOR using [[Shuttle-Derived Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle]]]]
The most famous example involved [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo CSM]] and [[Apollo Lunar Module|Apollo LM]], where they were both sent to a Translunar flight in a single rocket stack. However, variants where the landers and main spacecraft travel separately, such as the lunar landing plan proposed for [[Shuttle-Derived Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle]] and [[Golden Spike Company|Golden Spike]], are also considered as Lunar Orbit rendezvous.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
===Advantages===
[[File:Comparison of Lander Sizes - Direct vs LOR.gif|thumb|Comparison of lunar lander sizes, from an early Langley study]]
The main advantage of LOR is the spacecraft payload saving, due to the fact that the propellant necessary to return from lunar orbit back to Earth need not be carried as dead weight down to the Moon and back into lunar orbit. This has a multiplicative effect, because each pound of "dead weight" propellant used later has to be propelled by more propellant sooner, and also because increased propellant requires increased tankage weight. The resultant weight increase would also require more thrust for lunar landing, which means larger and heavier engines.{{sfnp|Reeves|2005}}

Another advantage is that the lunar lander can be designed for just that purpose, rather than requiring the main spacecraft to also be made suitable for a lunar landing. Finally, the second set of life support systems that the lunar lander requires can serve as a backup for the systems in the main spacecraft.

===Disadvantage===
Lunar-orbit rendezvous was considered risky as of 1962, because [[space rendezvous]] had not been achieved, even in Earth orbit. If the LEM could not reach the CSM, two astronauts would be stranded with no way to get back to Earth or survive [[atmospheric entry|re-entry into the atmosphere]]. The fear proved to be unfounded, as rendezvous was successfully demonstrated in 1965 and 1966 on six [[Project Gemini]] missions{{refn|group=Note|[[Gemini 6A]], [[Gemini 8]], [[Gemini 9A]], [[Gemini 10]], [[Gemini 11]], and [[Gemini 12]]}} with the aid of radar and on-board computers. It was also successfully done each of the eight times it was tried on Apollo missions.{{refn|group=Note|[[Apollo 9]] in Earth orbit; in lunar orbit on [[Apollo 10]], [[Apollo 11]], [[Apollo 12]], [[Apollo 14]], [[Apollo 15]], [[Apollo 16]], and [[Apollo 17]].}}

== Apollo Mission mode selection ==
[[File:Apollo 11 lunar module.jpg|thumb|[[Apollo 11]] Lunar Module rendezvousing with Command Module in lunar orbit]]
When the Apollo Moon landing program was started in 1961, it was assumed that the three-man [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command and Service Module combination]] (CSM) would be used for takeoff from the lunar surface, and return to Earth. It would therefore have to be landed on the Moon by a larger rocket stage with landing gear legs, resulting in a very large spacecraft (in excess of {{convert|100000|lb|kg}}) to be sent to the Moon.

If this were done by [[direct ascent]] (on a single [[launch vehicle]]), the rocket required would have to be extremely large, in the [[Nova rocket|Nova]] class. The alternative to this would have been [[Earth orbit rendezvous]], in which two or more rockets in the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn class]] would launch parts of the complete spacecraft, which would rendezvous in Earth orbit before departing for the Moon. This would possibly include a separately launched Earth departure stage, or require on-orbit refueling of the empty departure stage.

[[Tom Dolan (engineer)|Tom Dolan]]{{sfnp|Brooks|1979}} proposed the alternative of lunar orbit rendezvous, which had been studied and promoted by [[Jim Chamberlin]] and [[Owen Maynard]] at the [[Space Task Group]] in 1960 early Apollo feasibility studies.{{sfnp|Gainor|2001|p=62-66}} This mode allowed a single [[Saturn V]] to launch the CSM to the Moon with a smaller [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Excursion Module]] (LEM).{{refn|group=Note|This was shortened to "Lunar Module" (LM) in June 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Scheer, Julian W. (Assistant Administrator for Public Affairs, NASA). Memorandum from Project Designation Committee, June 9, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;}} When the combined spacecraft reaches [[lunar orbit]], one of the three astronauts remains with the CSM, while the other two enter the LEM, undock and descend to the surface of the Moon. They then use the ascent stage of the LEM to rejoin the CSM in lunar orbit, then discard the LEM and use the CSM for the return to Earth. This method was brought to the attention of NASA Associate Administrator [[Robert Seamans]] by [[Langley Research Center]] engineer [[John Houbolt|John C. Houbolt]], who led a team to develop it.

Besides requiring less payload, the ability to use a lunar lander designed just for that purpose was another advantage of the LOR approach. The LEM's design gave the astronauts a clear view of their landing site through observation windows approximately {{convert|15|ft|m}} above the surface, as opposed to being on their backs in a Command Module lander, at least {{convert|40|or|50|ft|m}} above the surface, able to see it only through a television screen.

Developing the LEM as a second manned vehicle provided the further advantage of redundant critical systems (electrical power, life support, and propulsion), which enabled it to be used as a "lifeboat" to keep the astronauts alive and get them home safely in the event of a critical CSM system failure. This was envisioned as a contingency, but not made a part of the LEM specifications. As it turned out, this capability proved invaluable in 1970, when just such a critical failure occurred on the [[Apollo 13]] mission when an oxygen tank failure disabled the Service Module.

[[File:John C. Houbolt - GPN-2000-001274.jpg|thumb|[[John Houbolt]] explains Lunar orbit rendezvous]]
Dr. John Houbolt would not let the advantages of LOR be ignored. As a member of Lunar Mission Steering Group, Houbolt had been studying various technical aspects of [[space rendezvous]] since 1959 and was convinced, like several others at [[Langley Research Center]], that LOR was not only the most feasible way to make it to the Moon before the decade was out, it was the only way. He had reported his findings to [[NASA]] on various occasions but felt strongly that the internal task forces (to which he made presentations) were following arbitrarily established "ground rules." According to Houbolt, these ground rules were constraining NASA's thinking about the lunar mission—and causing LOR to be ruled out before it was fairly considered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In November 1961, Houbolt took the bold step of skipping proper channels and writing a private letter, nine pages long, directly to [[Robert C. Seamans]], the associate administrator. "Somewhat as a voice in the wilderness," Houbolt protested LOR's exclusion. "Do we want to go to the Moon or not?" the Langley engineer asked. "Why is Nova, with its ponderous size simply just accepted, and why is a much less grandiose scheme involving rendezvous ostracized or put on the defensive? I fully realize that contacting you in this manner is somewhat unorthodox," Houbolt admitted, "but the issues at stake are crucial enough to us all that an unusual course is warranted."{{sfnp|Tennant|2009}}{{sfnp|Hansen|1995}}

It took two weeks for Seamans to reply to Houbolt's extraordinary letter. The associate administrator agreed that "it would be extremely harmful to our organization and to the country if our qualified staff were unduly limited by restrictive guidelines." He assured Houbolt that NASA would in the future be paying more attention to LOR than it had up to this time.

In the following months, NASA did just that, and to the surprise of many both inside and outside the agency, the dark horse candidate, LOR, quickly became the front runner. Several factors decided the issue in its favor. First, there was growing disenchantment with the idea of [[direct ascent]] due to the time and money it was going to take to develop a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter [[Nova (rocket)|Nova rocket]], compared to the {{convert|33|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter [[Saturn V]]. Second, there was increasing technical apprehension over how the relatively large spacecraft demanded even by Earth-orbit rendezvous would be able to maneuver to a soft landing on the Moon. As one NASA engineer who changed his mind explained: &lt;blockquote&gt;The business of eyeballing that thing down to the Moon really didn't have a satisfactory answer. The best thing about LOR was that it allowed us to build a separate vehicle for landing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first major group to break camp in favor of LOR was [[Robert R. Gilruth|Robert Gilruth]]'s Space Task Group, which was still located at Langley but was soon to move to [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Houston]]. The second to come over was the [[Wernher von Braun|Von Braun]] team at the  [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. Then these two powerful groups of converts, along with the original true believers at Langley, persuaded key officials at NASA Headquarters, notably Administrator [[James E. Webb|James Webb]], who had been holding out for direct ascent, that LOR was the only way to land on the Moon by 1969. With the key players inside NASA lined up behind the concept, Webb approved LOR in July 1962.{{sfnp|Witkin|1962}} The decision was officially announced at a press conference on July 11, 1962.{{sfnp|NASA|1962|p=1}} President Kennedy's science adviser, [[Jerome Wiesner]], remained firmly opposed to LOR.{{sfnp|Nelson|2009|p=209—210}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/Rendezvous.html|title=The Rendezvous That Was Almost Missed: Lunar Orbit Rendezvous and the Apollo Program - NASA|last=|first=|date=December 1992|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|id=Fact Sheet NF175|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;!-- This NASA Facts was prepared by the NASA Langley Research Center Office of Public Affairs, with the assistance of Dr. James R.

==Other plans using LOR==
*The proposed Soviet Lunar Landing plan, using the [[N1 (rocket)|N1 rocket]], [[LK (spacecraft)|LK Lander]] and [[Soyuz 7K-LOK]] would have used a similar LOR mission profile.
*The cancelled [[Constellation program]] Lunar Landing would have used a combination of [[Earth Orbit Rendezvous]] and Lunar Rendezvous.

{{more footnotes|date=April 2016}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''structure''' on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is an additional [[mathematical object]] that, in some manner, attaches (or relates) to that set to endow it with some additional meaning or significance.

A partial list of possible structures are [[Measure theory|measures]], [[algebraic structure]]s ([[group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[field (mathematics)|field]]s, etc.), [[Topology|topologies]], [[Metric space|metric structures]] ([[Geometry|geometries]]), [[Order theory|orders]], [[Event structure|events]], [[equivalence relation]]s, [[differential structure]]s, and [[Category (category theory)|categories]].

Sometimes, a set is endowed with more than one structure simultaneously; this enables mathematicians to study it more richly. For example, an ordering imposes a rigid form, shape, or topology on the set. As another example, if a set has both a topology and is a group, and these two structures are related in a certain way, the set becomes a [[topological group]].

[[Map (mathematics)|Mappings]] between sets which preserve structures (so that structures in the source or [[Domain of a function|domain]] are mapped to equivalent structures in the destination or [[codomain]]) are of special interest in many fields of mathematics. Examples are [[homomorphism]]s, which preserve algebraic structures; [[homeomorphism]]s, which preserve topological structures; and [[diffeomorphism]]s, which preserve differential structures.

==History==
In 1939, the French group with the pseudonym [[Nicolas Bourbaki]] saw structures as the root of mathematics. They first mentioned them in their "Fascicule" of ''Theory of Sets'' and expanded it into Chapter IV of the 1957 edition.&lt;ref name=Corry&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corry|first1=Leo|title=Nicolas Bourbaki and the concept of mathematical structure|journal=Synthese|date=September 1992|volume=92|issue=3|pages=315&amp;ndash;348|jstor=20117057|doi=10.1007/bf00414286}}&lt;/ref&gt; They identified three ''mother structures'': algebraic, topological, and order.&lt;ref name=Corry/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wells&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Richard B.|title=Biological signal processing and computational neuroscience|date=2010|pages=296&amp;ndash;335|url=http://www.mrc.uidaho.edu/~rwells/techdocs/Biological%20Signal%20Processing/Chapter%2010%20Mathematical%20Structures.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example: the real numbers==
The set of [[real number]]s has several standard structures:
*an order: each number is either less or more than any other number.
*algebraic structure: there are operations of multiplication and addition that make it into a [[Field (mathematics)|field]].
*a measure: intervals along the real line have a specific [[length]], which can be extended to the [[Lebesgue measure]] on many of its subsets.
*a metric: there is a notion of [[Metric (mathematics)|distance]] between points.
*a geometry: it is equipped with a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] and is [[Flatness (mathematics)|flat]].
*a topology: there is a notion of open sets.
There are interfaces among these:
*Its order and, independently, its metric structure induce its topology.
*Its order and algebraic structure make it into an [[ordered field]].
*Its algebraic structure and topology make it into a [[Lie group]], a type of [[topological group]].

NLP teaches that language and behaviors (whether functional or dysfunctional) are highly structured, and that this structure can be 'modeled' or copied into a reproducible form.&lt;ref name="Bandler &amp; Grinder 1979"&gt;{{cite book | author=Bandler, R., Grinder, J. | title=Frogs into Princes: Neuro Linguistic Programming | location=Moab, UT | publisher=Real People Press. | year=1979 | pages=149 (pp. 15, 24, 30, 45, 52) | isbn=0-911226-19-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}} Using NLP a person can 'model' the more successful parts of their own behavior in order to reproduce it in areas where they are less successful or 'model' another person to effect belief and behavior changes to improve functioning. If someone excels in some activity, it can be [[Modeling (NLP)|learned]] how specifically they do it by observing certain important details of their behavior.&lt;ref name="Bandler &amp; Grinder 1975a"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bandler, Richard  |author2=John Grinder  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=The Structure of Magic I: A Book About Language and Therapy | location=Palo Alto, CA | publisher=Science &amp; Behavior Books | year=1975|isbn= 0-8314-0044-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}} NLP embodies several techniques, including hypnotic techniques, which proponents claim can affect changes in the way people think, learn and communicate.&lt;ref name="Dilts et al. 1980"&gt;{{cite book | author=Dilts, R.B., Grinder, J., Bandler, R., DeLozier, J.A. | title=Neuro-Linguistic Programming: Volume I - The Study of the Structure of Subjective Experience | publisher=Meta Publications | year=1980 | isbn=0-916990-07-9 | pages=284(pp.3–4, 6, 14,17)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}} NLP is an eclectic field, often described as a 'toolbox' which has borrowed heavily from other fields in collating its presuppositions and techniques.

==Internal 'maps' of the world==
NLP calls each individual's perception of the world their 'map'.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} NLP teaches that our mind-body{{clarify|date=September 2017}} (neuro) and what we say (language) all interact together to form our perceptions of the world, or maps (programming). Each person's map of the world determines feelings and behavior.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Therefore, impoverished – and unrealistic – maps can restrict choices and result in problems.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
As an approach to personal development or therapy it involves understanding that people create their own internal 'map' or world, recognizing unhelpful or destructive  patterns of thinking based on impoverished maps of the world, then modifying or replacing these patterns with more useful or helpful ones. There is also an emphasis on ways to change internal representations or maps of the world in order to increase behavioral flexibility.&lt;ref name="Bandler &amp; Grinder 1979" /&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}&lt;ref name="Bandler &amp; Grinder 1975a" /&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}&lt;ref name="Bandler &amp; Grinder 1983"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bandler, Richard  |author2=John Grinder  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Reframing: Neurolinguistic programming and the transformation of meaning | location=Moab, UT | publisher=Real People Press. | year=1983 | pages=appendix II,p.171}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}

==Modeling==
"Modeling" in NLP is the process of adopting the behaviors, language, strategies and beliefs of another person or exemplar in order to 'build a model of what they do...we know that our modeling has been successful when we can systematically get the same behavioural outcome as the person we have modeled'.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The 'model' is then reduced{{by whom|date=September 2017}} to a pattern that can be taught to others. The founders, Bandler and Grinder, started by analysing in detail and then searching for what made successful [[psychotherapist]]s different from their peers. The patterns discovered were developed over time and adapted for general communication and effecting change.&lt;ref name="Bandler &amp; Grinder 1979"/&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}} The original models were: [[Milton Erickson]] ([[hypnotherapy]]), [[Virginia Satir]] ([[family therapy]]), and [[Fritz Perls]] ([[gestalt therapy]]). NLP modeling methods are designed to unconsciously assimilate the tacit knowledge to learn what the master is doing of which the master is not aware. As an approach to learning it can involve modeling exceptional people.&lt;ref name="Jacobson 1994"&gt;Jacobson, S. (1994)  Info-line: practical guidelines for training and development professionals, ''American Society For Training and Development'' Alexandria, VA. [http://sidjacobson.com/institute/history.html Adapted version available online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610030957/http://www.sidjacobson.com/institute/history.html |date=2007-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Bandler and Grinder state "the function of NLP modeling is to arrive at descriptions which are useful."&lt;ref name="Bandler &amp; Grinder 1979"/&gt;{{ufs|date=November 2017}} Einspruch &amp; Forman 1985 state that "when modeling another person the modeler suspends his or her own beliefs and adopts the structure of the physiology, language, strategies, and beliefs of the person being modeled. After the modeler is capable of behaviorally reproducing the patterns (of behavior, communication, and behavioral outcomes) of the one being modeled, a process occurs in which the modeler modifies and readopts his or her own belief system while also integrating the beliefs of the one who was modeled."&lt;ref name="Einspruch &amp; Forman 1985"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Einspruch, Eric L., Forman, Bruce D. | title=Observations Concerning Research Literature on Neuro-Linguistic Programming | journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology | year=1985 | volume=32 | pages=589–596 | doi=10.1037/0022-0167.32.4.589 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modeling is not confined to therapy, but can be, and is, applied to a broad range of human learning. Another aspect of modeling is understanding the patterns of one's own behaviors in order to 'model' the more successful parts of oneself.

==Milton model==

The '''Milton model''' is a form of hypnotherapy based on the language patterns for hypnotic communication of [[Milton Erickson]], a noted hypnotherapist.&lt;ref name="Barretta 2004"&gt;Norma Barretta (2004) Review of Hypnotic Language: Its Structure and Use. American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis. Bloomingdale: Jan 2004. Vol.46, Iss. 3;  pg. 261, 2 pgs&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "a way of using language to induce and maintain trance in order to contact the hidden resources of our personality".&lt;ref name="OConnor &amp; Seymour 2002"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Joseph O'Connor | author2=John Seymour | title=Introducing NLP | location=London | publisher=HarperCollins | year=2002 | origyear=1990 | url=http://www.reiters.com/index.cgi?ISBN=1855383446&amp;f=p | isbn=1-85538-344-6 | access-date=2007-04-30 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008050248/http://www.reiters.com/index.cgi?ISBN=1855383446&amp;f=p | archive-date=2007-10-08 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Milton model has three primary aspects: Firstly, to assist in building and maintaining rapport with the client. Secondly, to overload and distract the conscious mind so that [[unconscious communication]] can be cultivated. Thirdly, to allow for interpretation in the words offered to the client.&lt;ref name="Pruett 2002"&gt;Pruett, Julie Annette Sikes (2002) The application of the neuro-linguistic programming model to vocal performance training D.M.A., The University of Texas at Austin, 151 pages; AAT 3108499&lt;/ref&gt;

;1. Rapport

The first aspect, building '''rapport''', or empathy, is done to achieve better communication and responsiveness. NLP teaches 'mirroring' or matching body language, posture, breathing, predicates and voice tonality. Rapport is an aspect of 'pacing' or tuning into the client or learners world. Once pacing is established, the practitioner can 'lead' by changing their behavior or perception so the other follows. O'Connor &amp; Seymour in "Introducing NLP" describe rapport as a 'harmonious dance', an extension of natural skills, but warn against mimicry.&lt;ref name="OConnor &amp; Seymour 2002"/&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}} Singer gives examples of the pantomime effect of mere mimicry by some practitioners which does not create rapport.&lt;ref name="Singer &amp; Lalich 1997"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Singer, Margaret  |author2=Janja Lalich  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Crazy Therapies: What Are They? Do They Work? | publisher=Jossey Bass | year=1997 | isbn=0-7879-0278-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}

;2. Overloading conscious attention

The second aspect of the Milton model is that it uses ambiguity in language and non-verbal communication.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} This might also be combined with ''vagueness'', which arises when the boundaries of meaning are indistinct.{{clarify|date=September 2017}} The use of ambiguity and vagueness distracts the conscious mind as it tries to work out what is meant which gives the [[unconscious mind]] the opportunity to prosper.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}

;3. Indirect communication

The third aspect of the Milton model is that it is purposely vague and metaphoric for the purpose of accessing the unconscious mind. It is used to soften the meta model and make indirect suggestions.&lt;ref name="Bandler &amp; Grinder 1976"&gt;Bandler, Richard &amp; John Grinder (1976). Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H. Erickson, M.D. Volume 1. Cupertino, CA :Meta Publications. {{ISBN|0-916990-01-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}} A direct suggestion merely states what is wanted, for example, "when you are in front of the audience you will not feel nervous". In contrast an indirect suggestion is less authoritative and leaves an opportunity for interpretation, for example, "When you are in front of the audience, you might find yourself feeling ever more confident". This example follows the indirect method leaving both the specific time and level of self-confidence unspecified. It might be made even more indirect by saying, "when you come to a decision to speak in public, you may find it appealing how your feelings have changed." The choice of speaking in front of the audience, the exact time and the likely responses to the whole process are framed but the imprecise language gives the client the opportunity to fill in the finer details.&lt;ref name="Zahourek 2002"&gt;Rothlyn P Zahourek. (2002) Utilizing Ericksonian hypnosis in psychiatric-mental health nursing practice  Perspectives in Psychiatric Care. Philadelphia: Jan-Mar 2002. Vol.38, Iss. 1;  pg. 15, 8 pgs&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representational systems==
{{main|Representational systems (NLP)}}
The notion that experience is processed by the sensory systems or representational systems, was incorporated into NLP from psychology and gestalt therapy shortly after its creation.&lt;ref name="Bandler &amp; Grinder 1979"/&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}} This teaches that people perceive the world through the senses and store the information from the senses in the mind. Memories are closely linked to sensory experience. When people are processing information they see images and hear sounds and voices and process this with internally created feelings. Some representations are within conscious awareness but information is largely processed at the unconscious level. When involved in any task, such as making conversation, describing a problem in therapy, reading a book, kicking a ball or riding a horse, their representational systems, consisting of [[Visual thinking|images]], [[sound]]s, [[kinesthetic|feelings]] (and possibly [[olfactory|smell]] and [[gustatory|taste]]) are being activated at the same time.&lt;ref name="Druckman &amp; Swets 1998"&gt;Druckman and Swets (eds) (1988) [http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309037921/html/133.html Enhancing Human Performance: Issues, Theories, and Techniques]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{synthesis inline|date=September 2017}} Moreover, the way representational systems are organised and the links between them impact on behavioral performance. Many NLP techniques rely on interrupting maladaptive patterns{{clarify|date=September 2017}} and replacing them with more positive and creative thought patterns which will in turn impact on behavior.&lt;ref name="Cooper and Seal 2006"&gt;Cooper and Seal (2006) "Theory and Approaches - Eclectic-integrative approaches: Neuro-linguistic programming" In Feldtham and Horton (Eds) The SAGE Handbook of Counselling and Psychotherapy 2e&lt;/ref&gt;

;Preferred representational systems
Originally, NLP taught that most people had an internal preferred representational system (PRS) and preferred to process information primarily in one sensory modality.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} The practitioner could ascertain this from external cues such as the direction of eye movements, posture, breathing, voice tone and the use of sensory-based predicates. If a person repeatedly used predicates such as "I can ''see'' a ''bright'' future for myself", the words "see" and "bright" would be considered visual predicates. In contrast "I can feel that we will be comfortable" would be considered primarily kinesthetic because of the predicates "feel" and "comfortable". These verbal cues could also be coupled with posture changes, skin color or breathing shifts. The theory was that the practitioner by matching and working within the preferred representational system could achieve better communication with the client and hence swifter and more effective results. Many trainings and standard works still teach PRS&lt;ref name="OConnor &amp; Seymour 2002"/&gt; whilst other proponents{{who|date=August 2017}} have de-emphasized the existence and relevance of PRS and instead emphasize working within all representational systems.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Responding directly to sensory experience requires an immediacy which respects the importance of context.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Grinder has stated that a representational system diagnosis lasts about 30 seconds.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Although there is some research that supports the notion that eye movements can indicate visual and auditory (but not kinesthetic) components of thought in that moment,&lt;ref name="Buckner 1987"&gt;Buckner, Meara, Reese, and Reese (1987) Journal of Counselling Psychology , Vol. 34(3), pp.283-287&lt;/ref&gt; the existence of a preferred representational system ascertainable from external cues (an important part of original NLP theory) was discounted by research in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Sharpley 1984"&gt;Sharpley, C. F. (1984). Predicate matching in NLP: A review of research on the preferred representational system.

;Submodalities
{{how-to|date=September 2017}}
Submodalities are the fine details of representational systems.{{clarify|date=September 2017}} In the late 1970s the developers of NLP started playing around{{tone inline|date=September 2017}} with the submodalities of representational systems involving the enhancement of visualisation techniques (common in sports psychology and meditation), by including other sensory systems.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Submodalities involve the relative size, location, brightness of internal images, the volume and direction of internal voices and sounds, and the location, texture, and movement of internally created sensations.&lt;ref name="Tosey &amp; Mathison 2003"&gt;Tosey, P. Jane Mathison (2003) Neuro-linguistic Programming and learning theory: a response ''The Curriculum Journal'' Vol.14 No.3 p.371-388 See also (available online): [http://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/documents/00003319.htm Neuro-linguistic programming: its potential for learning and teaching in formal education]&lt;/ref&gt; Submodalities and hypnosis became the focus of Richard Bandler's later work.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} A typical change process may involve manipulating the submodalities of internal representations.{{clarify|date=September 2017}} For example, someone may see their future as 'dark and cloudy' with associated emotions, but would seek through NLP to perceive, and feel it, as 'light and clear'. Other training exercises develop a person's ability to move around internal images, change the quality of sounds and find out how these affect the intensity of internal feelings or other submodalities. Although NLP did not discover submodalities, it appears that the proponents of NLP may have been the first to systematically use manipulation of submodalities for therapeutic or personal development purposes, particularly phobias, compulsions and addictions.&lt;ref name="Dilts &amp; Delozier 2000"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dilts | first =  Robert B |author2=DeLozier, Judith A | title = Encyclopedia of Systemic Neuro-Linguistic Programming and NLP New Coding | publisher = NLP University Press |year= 2000  | url = http://www.nlpuniversitypress.com/ | isbn = 0-9701540-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}

==Meta-programs==

Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) uses the term 'meta-programs' specifically to indicate general, pervasive and usually habitual patterns used by an individual across a wide range of situations.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Examples of NLP meta-programs include the preference for overview or detail, the preference for where to place one's attention during conversation, habitual linguistic patterns and [[body language]], and so on.

Related concepts in other disciplines are known as [[cognitive styles]] or thinking styles.

In NLP, the term ''programs'' is used as a synonym for ''strategy'', which are specific sequences of mental steps, mostly indicated by their representational activity (using [[Representational systems (NLP)|VAKOG]]), leading to a behavioral outcome. In the entry for the term ''strategy'' in their Encyclopedia, [[Robert Dilts]] &amp; Judith Delozier explicitly refer to the mind as computer metaphor:
"A strategy is like a program in a computer.  It tells you what to do with the information you are getting, and like a computer program, you can use the same strategy to process a lot of different kinds of information."
In their encyclopedia, Dilts and Delozier then define metaprograms as:
"[programs] which guide and direct other thought processes. Specifically they define common or typical patterns in the strategies or thinking styles of a particular individual, group or culture."

The book 'Words that Change Minds' by Shelle Rose Charvet documents 13 distinct meta-programs categories affecting work-place motivation and performance, commonly known as the Language and Behaviour Profile or 'LAB Profile'. It is based on the work of Rodger Bailey and Ross Steward who wanted to make meta-programs usable to people without NLP training.

==Aphorisms/presuppositions==
Depending on the branch of NLP (different trainers or companies) the number and some of the content of the presuppositions may vary. Some of them are:
* The meaning of a communication is the response that you get (not the one intended).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Life and 'Mind' are Systemic Processes{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* [[Biopsychosocial model|Mind and body are parts of the same system and have influence over each other]]{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* [[Law of Requisite Variety]]{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* All behaviour is geared towards adaptation{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Behind every behavior is a positive intention{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* People are doing the best they can with the choices they have available{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Choice is better than no choice (and flexibility is the way one gets choice){{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Multiple descriptions are better than one{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Behaviour is to be evaluated and appreciated or changed as appropriate in the context presented{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* People already have all the resources they need to succeed{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* The highest quality information you can have of someone is their (present) behaviour.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* People are not their behaviour: accept people, change the behaviour (Also: Make distinction between behaviour and self).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Every outcome manifested is Feedback: there is no failure, only feedback{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Techniques==
{{how-to|date=September 2017}}

===Anchoring===
NLP teaches that we constantly make "anchors" ([[Classical Conditioning]]) between what we see, hear and feel and our emotional states. While in an emotional state if a person is exposed to a unique stimulus (sight, sound or touch) then a connection is made between the emotion and the unique stimulus. If the unique stimulus occurs again, the emotional state will then be triggered. NLP teaches that anchors (such as a particular touch associated with a memory or state) can be deliberately created and triggered to help people access 'resourceful' or other target states.&lt;ref name="Krugman 1985"&gt;Krugman, Martin, ''et al.'', (1985): "Neuro-linguistic programming treatment for anxiety: Magic or myth?." Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology. Aug, Vol. 53(4) pp. 526-530.&lt;/ref&gt; Anchoring appears to have been imported into NLP from family therapy as part of the 'model' of [[Virginia Satir]].&lt;ref name="Haber 2002"&gt;Haber, Russell, (2002): Virginia Satir: An integrated, humanistic approach [[Contemporary Family Therapy]], Vol 24(1), Mar 2002,p32 pp. 23-34 ISSN 1573-3335 {{doi|10.1023/A:1014317420921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future pacing===
A technique of asking a person to [[Feedforward, Behavioral and Cognitive Science|imagine doing something in the future]] and monitoring their reactions. It is typically used to check that a change process has been successful; (i.e. by observing body language when the person imagines being in a difficult situation before and after an intervention). If the [[body language]] is the same then the [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] has not been successful. Future pacing can be used to "embed" change into the contexts of the future. It gives a person the experience of dealing positively with a situation before they get into that situation in reality. This is based on [[Mental image|visualization]] where the mind is assumed not to be able to tell the difference between a scenario which is real and one which has been clearly visualized.  The theory is that, having visualized positively, when the subject encounters the situation again in reality the visualized experience will serve as a model for how to behave, even though this experience was imagined. The mind cannot tell the difference between the visualization and reality so it accepts the visualization as reality and [[Accommodation (psychology)|makes the change]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Swish===
The swish pattern is a process that is designed to disrupt a pattern of thought from one that used to lead to an unwanted behavior to one that leads to a desired behavior.   This involves visualizing a 'cue' which leads into the unwanted behavior, such as a smokers hand moving towards the face with a cigarette in it, and reprogramming the mind to 'switch' to a visualization of the desired outcome, such as a healthy-looking person, energetic and fit. In addition to visualization, auditory sound effects are often imagined to enhance the experience.&lt;ref name="Masters et al. 1991"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Masters, B|author2=Rawlins, M|author3=Rawlins, L|author4=Weidner, J|year=1991|title=The NLP swish pattern: An innovative visualizing technique|journal=Journal of Mental Health Counseling|volume=13|issue=1|pages=79–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swish is one of the techniques that involves the manipulation of submodalities.

===Reframing===
Another technique, "reframing" functions through "changing the way you perceive an event and so changing the meaning.  When the meaning changes, responses and behaviors will also change. Reframing with language allows you to see the world in a different way and this changes the meaning. Reframing is the basis of jokes, myths, legends, fairy tales and most creative ways of thinking."&lt;ref name="Joseph O'Connor"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph O'Connor|title=NLP: A Practical Guide to Achieving the Results You Want: Workbook|publisher=Harper Collins|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are examples in children's literature. [[Pollyanna]] would play [[The Glad Game]] whenever she felt down about life, to remind herself of the things that she could do, and not  worry about the things she couldn't. Alice Mills also says that this occurs in [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s story where to the surprise of the [[ugly duckling]], the beautiful creatures welcome and accept him; gazing at his reflection, he sees that he too is a swan.&lt;ref name="Mills 1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alice Mills |title=Pollyanna and the not so glad game|type= Children's Literature|publisher=Storrs|year=1999|volume=27|pages=87, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reframing is common to a number of therapies and was not original to NLP.&lt;ref name="Sharpley 1987"/&gt;{{rp|103–107, 105}}

An example of reframing is found in the "six-step reframe" which involves distinguishing between an underlying intention and the consequent behaviors for the purpose of achieving the intention by different and more successful behaviors. It is based on the notion that there is a positive intention behind all behaviors, but that the behaviors themselves may be unwanted or counterproductive in other ways. NLP uses this staged process to identify the intention and create alternative choices to satisfy that intention.

===Well-formed outcome===
In NLP this is one of a number of 'frames' wherein the desired state is considered as to its achievability and effect if achieved. A positive outcome must be defined by the client for their own use, be within the clients power to achieve, retain the positive products of the unwanted behaviors and produce an outcome that is appropriate for all circumstances.&lt;ref name="Dilts &amp; Delozier 2000"/&gt;

===Ecology===
This is a frame within which the desired outcome is checked against the consequences in the clients life and relationships from all angles.

===Parts integration===
"Parts Integration" is based on the idea that different aspects of ourselves are in conflict due to different perceptions and beliefs. 'Parts integration' is the process of integrating the disparate aspects of the self by identifying and then negotiating with the separate parts to achieve resolution of internal conflict. Parts integration appears to be modeled on 'parts' from [[family therapy]] and has similarities to [[ego-state therapy]] in psychoanalysis.

===VK/D===
VK/D stands for 'Visual/Kinesthetic Dissociation'. This is a technique designed to eliminate bad feelings associated with past events by re-running (like a film, sometimes in reverse) an associated memory in a [[Dissociation (neuropsychology)|dissociated]] state. It combines elements of Eriksonian techniques, spatial sorting processes from Fritz Perls, reframing and 'changing history' techniques.&lt;ref name="Dilts &amp; Delozier 2000"/&gt;

;Metaphor
Largely derived from the ideas of Bateson and the techniques of Erikson, 'metaphor' in NLP ranges from simple figures of speech to allegories and stories. It tends to be used in conjunction with the skills of the Milton model to create a story which operates on many levels with the intention of communicating with the unconscious and to find and challenge basic assumptions.&lt;ref name="OConnor &amp; Seymour 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dilts &amp; Delozier 2000"/&gt;

;State management
Sometimes called '''state control''', is a [[neuro-linguistic programming]] (NLP) technique involving actively trying to control the emotional and mental state of an individual. One method to actively achieve state management anchoring where an individual associates a particular physical [[stimulation|stimulus]]. It is used as both a self-help method and a therapeutic [[hypnotherapy]] technique.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Covert hypnosis===
{{Main|Covert hypnosis}}
Covert hypnosis is purportedly a method of using language patterns to hypnotise or persuade other people. Referred to as "sleight of mouth" by [[Robert Dilts]].&lt;ref name="Dilts 1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dilts, Robert|year=1999|title=Sleight of Mouth: The Magic of Conversational Belief Change|ISBN=0-916990-43-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; building off the phrase "[[sleight of hand]]", which refers to a magician's skills in making things happen which appear impossible.

The '''''N''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; chart''', also referred to as '''''N''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; diagram''', '''''N''-squared diagram''' or '''''N''-squared chart''', is a [[diagram]] in the shape of a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], representing functional or physical interfaces between [[system]] elements. It is used to systematically identify, define, tabulate, design, and analyze functional and physical interfaces. It applies to system [[Interface (computer science)|interface]]s and [[computer hardware|hardware]] and/or [[software]] interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;The first version of this article is completely based on the [http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/operations/sysengsaf/seman/SEM3.1/Section%204.4.pdf NAS SYSTEM ENGINEERING MANUAL SECTION] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114031713/http://www.faa.gov/about/office%5Forg/headquarters%5Foffices/ato/service%5Funits/operations/sysengsaf/seman/SEM3.1/Section%204.4.pdf |date=2009-01-14 }} 4.4 VERSION 3.1 06/06/06.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''N''-squared chart was invented by the [[Systems engineering|systems engineer]] Robert J. Lano, while working at [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] in the 1970s and first published in a 1977 TRW internal report.&lt;ref&gt;Lano, R. (1977). ''The N&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Chart''. TRW Software Series, Redondo Beach, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The ''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; diagram has been used extensively to develop data interfaces, primarily in the [[software]] areas. However, it can also be used to develop [[computer hardware|hardware]] interfaces. The basic ''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; chart is shown in Figure 2. The system functions are placed on the diagonal; the remainder of the squares in the ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''N'' matrix represent the interface inputs and outputs.

Where a blank appears, there is no interface between the respective functions. Data flows in a clockwise direction between functions (e.g., the symbol F1 F2 indicates data flowing from function F1, to function F2). The data being transmitted can be defined in the appropriate squares. Alternatively, the use of circles and numbers permits a separate listing of the data interfaces. The clockwise flow of data between functions that have a [[feedback loop]] can be illustrated by a larger circle called a control loop. The identification of a critical function is also shown in Figure 3, where function F4 has a number of inputs and outputs to all other functions in the upper module. A simple flow of interface data exists between the upper and lower modules at functions F7 and F8. The lower module has complex interaction among its functions. The N2 chart can be taken down into successively lower levels to the hardware and software component functional levels. In addition to defining the data that must be supplied across the interface, the N2 chart can pinpoint areas where conflicts could arise.&lt;ref name="NASA95"/&gt; 

== ''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; charts building blocks ==
=== Number of entities ===
The “''N''” in an ''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; diagram is the number of entities for which relationships are shown. This ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''N'' matrix requires the user to generate complete definitions of all interfaces in a rigid bidirectional, fixed framework. The user places the functional or physical entities on the diagonal axis and the interface inputs and outputs in the remainder of the diagram squares. A blank square indicates that there is no interface between the respective entities. Data flows clockwise between entities (i.e., the symbol F1 → F2, in Figure 4, indicates data flowing from function F1 to function F2; the symbol F2 → F1 indicates the feedback). That which passes across the interface is defined in the appropriate squares. 

The diagram is complete when the user has compared each entity to all other entities. The N2 diagram should be used in each successively lower level of entity decomposition. Figure 1 illustrates directional flow
of interfaces between entities within an ''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; diagram. (In this case, the entities are functions.)

=== Functions on the diagonal ===
[[Image:10 N2 Diagram.jpg|thumb|360px|Figure 4. ''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; diagram.]]
In the example on the right, ''N'' equals 5. The five functions are on the diagonal. The arrows show the flow of data between functions. So if function 1 sends data to function 2, the data elements would be placed in the box to the right of function 1. If function 1 does not send data to any of the other functions, the rest of the boxes to right of function 1 would be empty. If function 2 sends data to function 3 and function 5, then the data elements would be placed in the first and third boxes to the right of function 2. If any function sends data back to a previous function, then the associated box to the left of the function would have the data elements placed in it. The squares on either side of the diagonal (not just adjacent squares) are filled in with appropriate data to depict the flow between the functions. If there is no interface between two functions, the square that represents the interface between the two functions is left blank. Physical interfaces would be handled in the same manner, with the physical entities on the diagonal rather than the functional entities.

=== Contextual and administrative data ===
Each ''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; diagram shall contain at a minimum the following contextual and administrative data:
* Date the diagram was created
* Name of the engineer, organization, or working group that created the diagram
* Unique decimal delimited number of the functional or physical entity being diagrammed
* Unique name for the functional or physical entity being diagrammed

N2 diagrams are a valuable tool for not only identifying functional or physical interfaces, but also for pinpointing areas in which conflicts may arise with interfaces so that system integration proceeds smoothly and efficiently.

[[Image:11 N2 Diagram Illustration.jpg|center|420px|Figure 5. ''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; diagram building blocks.]] 
Figure 5 presents information in an N2 diagram, which complements the [[Functional flow block diagram]].  Notice that in this illustration, there are no data elements or triggers. The figure illustrates the context between functions at different levels of the model.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2233">'''NSCAD conceptual art''' refers to a period beginning in 1969 when [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]] (NSCAD), a post-secondary [[art]] school in [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]] became an important art centre with an international reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Barber, "Conceptual Art: The NSCAD Connection 1967-1973", ''Conceptual Art: The NSCAD Connection 1967-1973'', Halifax: Anna Leonowens Gallery, 1998, p. 11''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1967, the artist [[Garry Kennedy]] was appointed President, and he immediately moved to remake the College from a provincial art school into an international centre for artistic activity. He invited notable artists to come to NSCAD as visiting artists, particularly those involved in [[conceptual art]]. Artists who made significant contributions during this period include [[Vito Acconci]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Dan Graham]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Joseph Beuys]] and [[Claes Oldenburg]].

==NSCAD University Press==
Under the direction of Kennedy, The Press of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design was established as a vehicle to publish books by and about leading contemporary artists. The Press was instrumental in establishing the university's international reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Garry Neill Kennedy, "NSCAD and the Sixties", ''Conceptual Art: The NSCAD Connection 1967-1973'', pp. 25-6&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1972 and 1987, 26 titles by such artists as [[Michael Snow]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Gerhard Richter]] and [[Yvonne Rainer]] were published.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3649">In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the '''opposite category''' or '''dual category''' ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; of a given category ''C'' is formed by reversing the [[morphism]]s, i.e. interchanging the source and target of each morphism. Doing the reversal twice yields the original category, so the opposite of an opposite category is the original category itself. In symbols, &lt;math&gt;(C^{\text{op}})^{\text{op}} = C&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
* An example comes from reversing the direction of inequalities in a [[partial order]]. So if ''X'' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] and ≤ a partial order relation, we can define a new partial order relation ≤&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt; by

:: ''x'' ≤&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt; ''y'' if and only if ''y'' ≤ ''x''.

: For example, there are opposite pairs child/parent, or descendant/ancestor.

* The category of [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s and Boolean [[homomorphism]]s is [[Equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the opposite of the category of [[Stone space]]s and continuous functions.
* The category of [[affine scheme]]s is [[equivalence (category theory)|equivalent]] to the opposite of the category of [[commutative ring]]s.
* The [[Pontryagin duality]] restricts to an equivalence between the category of [[Compact space#Definition|compact]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[abelian group|abelian]] [[topological group]]s and the opposite of the category of (discrete) abelian groups.
* By the Gelfand–Neumark theorem, the category of localizable [[Sigma-algebra|measurable spaces]] (with [[measurable function|measurable maps]]) is equivalent to the category of commutative [[Von Neumann algebra]]s (with [[Normal operator|normal]] [[Unital map|unital]] homomorphisms of *-algebras).&lt;ref name=MO1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathoverflow.net/questions/20740/is-there-an-introduction-to-probability-theory-from-a-structuralist-categorical-p|title=Is there an introduction to probability theory from a structuralist/categorical perspective?|publisher=MathOverflow|accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Opposite preserves products:
:&lt;math&gt;(C\times D)^{\text{op}} \cong C^{\text{op}}\times D^{\text{op}}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[product category]])

Opposite preserves [[functors]]:
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{Funct}(C,D))^{\text{op}} \cong \mathrm{Funct}(C^{\text{op}},D^{\text{op}})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Herrlich, G. E. Strecker, ''Category Theory'', 3rd Edition, Heldermann Verlag, {{isbn|978-3-88538-001-6}}, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O. Wyler, ''Lecture Notes on Topoi and Quasitopoi'', World Scientific, 1991, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[functor category]], [[opposite functor]])

Opposite preserves slices:
:&lt;math&gt;(F\downarrow G)^{\text{op}} \cong (G^{\text{op}}\downarrow F^{\text{op}})&lt;/math&gt; (see [[comma category]])

A '''persistent vegetative state''' ('''PVS''') is a [[disorder of consciousness]] in which patients with severe [[brain damage]] are in a state of partial [[arousal]] rather than true [[awareness]]. After four weeks in a vegetative state (VS), the patient is classified as in a persistent vegetative state. This diagnosis is classified as a ''permanent vegetative state'' some months (3 in the US and 6 in the UK) after a non-traumatic brain injury or one year after a traumatic injury. Nowadays, more doctors and neuroscientists prefer to call the state of consciousness an''syndrome'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laureys|first=Steven|last2=Celesia|first2=Gastone G|last3=Cohadon|first3=Francois|last4=Lavrijsen|first4=Jan|last5=León-Carrión|first5=José|last6=Sannita|first6=Walter G|last7=Sazbon|first7=Leon|last8=Schmutzhard|first8=Erich|last9=von Wild|first9=Klaus R|date=2010-11-01|title=Unresponsive wakefulness syndrome: a new name for the vegetative state or apallic syndrome|journal=BMC Medicine|volume=8|pages=68|doi=10.1186/1741-7015-8-68|issn=1741-7015|pmc=2987895|pmid=21040571}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily because of ethical questions about whether a patient can be called "vegetative" or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Laureys S, Celesia GG, Cohadon F, Lavrijsen J, León-Carrión J, Sannita WG, Sazbon L, Schmutzhard E, von Wild KR, Zeman A, Dolce G | year = 2010 | title = Unresponsive wakefulness syndrome: a new name for the vegetative state or apallic syndrome | url = | journal = BMC Med. | volume = 8 | issue = | page = 68 | doi = 10.1186/1741-7015-8-68 | pmid = 21040571 | pmc=2987895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
There are several definitions that vary by technical versus layman's usage. There are different legal implications in different countries.

===Medical definition===
A wakeful unconscious state that lasts longer than a few weeks is referred to as a persistent (or 'continuing') vegetative state.&lt;ref name="rcplondon.ac.uk"&gt;Royal College of Physicians 2013 Prolonged Disorders of Consciousness:  National Clinical Guidelines, https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/resources/prolonged-disorders-consciousness-national-clinical-guidelines&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of legal clarity===
Unlike [[brain death]], permanent vegetative state (PVS) is recognized by  ''[[statute law]]'' as [[death]] in very few legal systems. In the US, courts have required petitions before termination of life support that demonstrate that any recovery of cognitive functions above a vegetative state is assessed as impossible by authoritative medical opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1116645 | pmid=10496803|year=1999|last1=Jennett|first1=B|title=Should cases of permanent vegetative state still go to court?.

This legal [[wikt:grey area|grey area]] has led to vocal advocates that those in PVS should be [[Euthanasia|allowed to die]]. Others are equally determined that, if recovery is at all possible, care should continue. The existence of a small number of diagnosed PVS cases that have eventually resulted in improvement makes defining recovery as "impossible" particularly difficult in a legal sense.&lt;ref name="searchmedica.com"&gt;[http://www.searchmedica.com/resource.html?rurl=http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2004/08/cprl1-0408.html&amp;q=Persistent+Vegetative+State&amp;c=pc&amp;ss=defLink&amp;p=Convera&amp;ds=0&amp;srid=2 Diagnosing The Permanent Vegetative State by Ronald Cranford, MD]&lt;/ref&gt;  This legal and ethical issue raises questions about autonomy, quality of life, appropriate use of resources, the wishes of family members, and professional responsibilities.

===Vegetative state===

The vegetative state is a chronic or long-term condition. This condition differs from a [[coma]]: a coma is a state that lacks both awareness and wakefulness. Patients in a vegetative state may have awoken from a coma, but still have not regained awareness. In the vegetative state patients can open their eyelids occasionally and demonstrate sleep-wake cycles, but completely lack cognitive function. The vegetative state is also called a "coma vigil". The chances of regaining awareness diminish considerably as the time spent in the vegetative state increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=PVS|first=The Multi-Society Task Force on|date=1994-05-26|title=Medical Aspects of the Persistent Vegetative State|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJM199405263302107|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=330|issue=21|pages=1499–1508|doi=10.1056/NEJM199405263302107|issn=0028-4793|pmid=7818633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persistent vegetative state===

Persistent vegetative state is the standard usage (except in the UK) for a medical diagnosis, made after numerous neurological and other tests, that due to extensive and irreversible brain damage a patient is ''highly unlikely'' ever to achieve higher functions above a vegetative state. This diagnosis does not mean that a doctor has diagnosed improvement as impossible, but does open the possibility, in the US, for a judicial request to end life support.&lt;ref name="searchmedica.com"/&gt; Informal guidelines hold that this diagnosis can be made after four weeks in a vegetative state. US caselaw has shown that successful petitions for termination have been made after a diagnosis of a persistent vegetative state, although in some cases, such as that of [[Terri Schiavo]], such rulings have generated widespread controversy.

In the UK, the term 'persistent vegetative state' is discouraged in favor of two more precisely defined terms that have been strongly recommended by the [[Royal College of Physicians|Royal College of Physicians (RCP)]].  These guidelines recommend using a '''continuous vegetative state''' for patients in a vegetative state for more than four weeks.  A medical definition of a '''permanent vegetative state''' can be made if, after exhaustive testing and a customary 12 months of observation,&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1116668 | pmid=10496834|year=1999|last1=Wade|first1=DT|last2=Johnston|first2=C|title=The permanent vegetative state: Practical guidance on diagnosis and management|volume=319|issue=7213|pages=841–4|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|doi=10.1136/bmj.319.7213.841}}&lt;/ref&gt; a medical diagnosis that it is ''impossible'' by any informed medical expectations that the mental condition will ever improve.&lt;ref name="rcp"&gt;{{cite book | title=Guidance on diagnosis and management: Report of a working party of the Royal College of Physicians | publisher=[[Royal College of Physicians]]: London | year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, a "continuous vegetative state" in the UK may remain the diagnosis in cases that would be called "persistent" in the US or elsewhere.

While the actual testing criteria for a diagnosis of "permanent" in the UK are quite similar to the criteria for a diagnosis of "persistent" in the US, the semantic difference imparts in the UK a ''legal'' presumption that is commonly used in court applications for ending life support.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;  The UK diagnosis is generally only made after 12 months of observing a static vegetative state. A diagnosis of a persistent vegetative state in the US usually still requires a petitioner to prove in court that recovery is impossible by informed medical opinion, while in the UK the "permanent" diagnosis already gives the petitioner this presumption and may make the legal process less time-consuming.&lt;ref name="searchmedica.com"/&gt;

In common usage, the "permanent" and "persistent" definitions are sometimes conflated and used interchangeably. However, the acronym "PVS" is intended to define a "persistent vegetative state", without necessarily the connotations of permanence, and is used as such throughout this article.

[[Bryan Jennett]], who originally coined the term "persistent vegetative state", has now recommended using the UK division between continuous and permanent in his most recent book ''[[The Vegetative State]]''.  This is one for purposes of precision, on the grounds that "the 'persistent' component of this term ... may seem to suggest irreversibility".&lt;ref name="Jennett"/&gt;

The Australian [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] has suggested "post coma unresponsiveness" as an alternative term for "vegetative state" in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Post-coma unresponsiveness (Vegetative State): a clinical framework for diagnosis | publisher=National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC): Canberra | year=2003 | url=http://www.health.gov.au/nhmrc/publications/synopses/hpr23syn.htm | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820035510/http://www7.health.gov.au/nhmrc/publications/synopses/hpr23syn.htm | archivedate=2006-08-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
Most PVS patients are unresponsive to external stimuli and their conditions are associated with different levels of consciousness. Some level of consciousness means a person can still respond, in varying degrees, to stimulation. A person in a coma, however, cannot. In addition, PVS patients often open their eyes in response to feeding, which has to be done by others; they are capable of swallowing, whereas patients in a coma subsist with their eyes closed (Emmett, 1989).

Cerebral cortical function (e.g. communication, thinking, purposeful movement, etc) is lost while brainstem functions (e.g. breathing, maintaining circulation and hemodynamic stability, etc) are preserved.  Non-cognitive upper brainstem functions such as eye-opening, occasional vocalizations (e.g. crying, laughing), maintaining normal sleep patterns, and spontaneous non-purposeful movements often remain intact.   

PVS patients' eyes might be in a relatively fixed position, or track moving objects, or move in a ''[[Vergence|disconjugate]]'' (i.e., completely unsynchronized) manner. They may experience [[sleep]]-wake cycles, or be in a state of chronic wakefulness. They may exhibit some behaviors that can be construed as arising from partial consciousness, such as grinding their teeth, swallowing, smiling, shedding tears, grunting, moaning, or screaming without any apparent external [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]].

Individuals in PVS are seldom on any life-sustaining equipment other than a [[feeding tube]] because the [[brainstem]], the center of vegetative functions (such as heart rate and rhythm, respiration, and [[gastrointestinal]] activity) is relatively intact (Emmett, 1989).

===Recovery===
Many people emerge spontaneously from a vegetative state within a few weeks.&lt;ref name="Jennett"/&gt; The chances of recovery depend on the extent of injury to the brain and the patient's age – younger patients having a better chance of recovery than older patients. A 1994 report found that of those who were in a vegetative state a month after a trauma, 54% had regained consciousness by a year after the trauma, whereas 28% had died and 18% were still in the vegetative state. But for non-traumatic injuries such as [[stroke]]s, only 14% had recovered consciousness at one year, 47% had died, and 39% were still vegetative. Patients who were vegetative six months after the initial event were much less likely to have recovered consciousness a year after the event than in the case of those who were simply reported vegetative at one month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jennett | first1 = B | year=2002 | title=Editorial: The vegetative state.

The longer a patient is in a PVS, the more severe the resulting disabilities are likely to be. Rehabilitation can contribute to recovery, but many patients never progress to the point of being able to take care of themselves.

There are two dimensions of recovery from a persistent vegetative state: recovery of [[consciousness]] and recovery of function. Recovery of consciousness can be verified by reliable evidence of [[awareness]] of self and the environment, consistent voluntary behavioral responses to visual and auditory stimuli, and interaction with others. Recovery of function is characterized by communication, the ability to learn and to perform adaptive tasks, mobility, self-care, and participation in recreational or vocational activities. Recovery of consciousness may occur without functional recovery, but functional recovery cannot occur without recovery of consciousness (Ashwal, 1994).

== Causes ==
There are three main causes of PVS (persistent vegetative state):
# Acute [[traumatic brain injury]]
# Non-traumatic: [[neurodegenerative disorder]] or [[metabolic disorder]] of the brain
# Severe congenital abnormality of the [[central nervous system]]

Medical books (such as Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins. (2007). In A Page: Pediatric Signs and Symptoms) describe several potential causes of PVS, which are as follows:

* Bacterial, viral, or fungal infection, including [[meningitis]]
*Increased intracranial pressure, such as a [[tumor]] or [[abscess]]
*Vascular pressure which causes intracranial hemorrhaging or stroke
*Hypoxic ischemic injury ([[hypotension]], [[cardiac arrest]], [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]], near-drowning)
*Toxins such as uremia, [[ethanol]], [[atropine]], [[opiates]], [[lead]], [[colloidal silver]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15111684 | volume=62 | issue=8 | title=Myoclonic status epilepticus following repeated oral ingestion of colloidal silver |date=April 2004 |vauthors=Mirsattari SM, Hammond RR, Sharpe MD, Leung FY, Young GB | journal=Neurology | pages=1408–10 | doi=10.1212/01.WNL.0000120671.73335.EC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Trauma: Concussion, contusion
*Seizure, both nonconvulsive status epilepticus and postconvulsive state (postictal state)
*Electrolyte imbalance, which involves [[hyponatremia]], [[hypernatremia]], [[hypomagnesemia]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[hyperglycemia]], [[hypercalcemia]], and [[hypocalcemia]]
*Postinfectious: [[Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis]] (ADEM)
*Endocrine disorders such as adrenal insufficiency and thyroid disorders
*Degenerative and [[metabolic disease]]s including urea cycle disorders, [[Reye syndrome]], and mitochondrial disease
*Systemic infection and [[sepsis]]
*[[Hepatic encephalopathy]]

In addition, these authors claim that doctors sometimes use the [[mnemonic]] device AEIOU-TIPS to recall portions of the differential diagnosis: Alcohol ingestion and acidosis, Epilepsy and encephalopathy, Infection, Opiates, Uremia, Trauma, Insulin overdose or inflammatory disorders, Poisoning and psychogenic causes, and Shock.

== Diagnosis ==
Despite converging agreement about the definition of persistent vegetative state, recent reports have raised concerns about the accuracy of diagnosis in some patients, and the extent to which, in a selection of cases, residual [[cognitive]] functions may remain undetected and patients are diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state. Objective assessment of residual cognitive function can be extremely difficult as motor responses may be minimal, inconsistent, and difficult to document in many patients, or may be undetectable in others because no cognitive output is possible (Owen et al., 2002). In recent years, a number of studies have demonstrated an important role for [[functional neuroimaging]] in the identification of residual cognitive function in persistent vegetative state; this technology is providing new insights into [[Cerebrum|cerebral]] activity in patients with severe brain damage. Such studies, when successful, may be particularly useful where there is concern about the accuracy of the diagnosis and the possibility that residual cognitive function has remained undetected.

===Diagnostic experiments===
Researchers have begun to use functional neuroimaging studies to study implicit cognitive processing in patients with a clinical diagnosis of persistent vegetative state. Activations in response to sensory stimuli with [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), and [[electrophysiological]] methods can provide information on the presence, degree, and location of any residual brain function. However, use of these techniques in people with severe brain damage is methodologically, clinically, and theoretically complex and needs careful quantitative analysis and interpretation.

For example, PET studies have shown the identification of residual cognitive function in persistent vegetative state. That is, an external stimulation, such as a painful stimulus, still activates "primary" sensory cortices in these patients but these areas are functionally disconnected from "higher order" associative areas needed for awareness. These results show that parts of the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] are indeed still functioning in "vegetative" patients (Matsuda et al., 2003).

In addition, other PET studies have revealed preserved and consistent responses in predicted regions of [[auditory cortex]] in response to intelligible speech stimuli. Moreover, a preliminary fMRI examination revealed partially intact responses to semantically ambiguous stimuli, which are known to tap higher aspects of speech comprehension (Boly, 2004).

Furthermore, several studies have used PET to assess the central processing of [[Poison|noxious]] [[somatosensory]] stimuli in patients in PVS. Noxious somatosensory stimulation activated [[midbrain]], contralateral [[thalamus]], and [[primary somatosensory cortex]] in each and every PVS patient, even in the absence of detectable cortical [[evoked potential]]s. In conclusion, somatosensory stimulation of PVS patients, at intensities that elicited pain in controls, resulted in increased neuronal activity in primary somatosensory cortex, even if resting brain metabolism was severely impaired. However, this activation of primary cortex seems to be isolated and dissociated from higher-order associative cortices (Laureys et al., 2002).

Also, there is evidence of partially functional cerebral regions in catastrophically injured brains. To study five patients in PVS with different behavioral features, researchers employed PET, MRI and [[magnetoencephalographic]] (MEG) responses to sensory stimulation. In three of the five patients, co-registered [[PET/MRI]] correlate areas of relatively preserved brain metabolism with isolated fragments of behavior. Two patients had suffered [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxic]] injuries and demonstrated marked decreases in overall cerebral metabolism to 30–40% of normal. Two other patients with non-anoxic, multifocal brain injuries demonstrated several isolated brain regions with higher [[metabolic]] rates, that ranged up to 50–80% of normal. Nevertheless, their global metabolic rates remained &lt;50% of normal. MEG recordings from three PVS patients provide clear evidence for the absence, abnormality or reduction of evoked responses. Despite major abnormalities, however, these data also provide evidence for localized residual activity at the [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] level. Each patient partially preserved restricted sensory representations, as evidenced by slow evoked magnetic fields and gamma band activity. In two patients, these activations correlate with isolated behavioral patterns and metabolic activity. Remaining active regions identified in the three PVS patients with behavioral fragments appear to consist of segregated corticothalamic networks that retain connectivity and partial functional integrity. A single patient who suffered severe injury to the tegmental [[mesencephalon]] and paramedian [[thalamus]] showed widely preserved cortical metabolism, and a global average metabolic rate of 65% of normal. The relatively high preservation of cortical metabolism in this patient defines the first functional correlate of clinical– pathological reports associating permanent unconsciousness with structural damage to these regions. The specific patterns of preserved metabolic activity identified in these patients reflect novel evidence of the modular nature of individual functional networks that underlie conscious brain function. The variations in cerebral metabolism in chronic PVS patients indicate that some cerebral regions can retain partial function in catastrophically injured brains (Schiff et al., 2002).

=== Misdiagnoses ===
Statistical PVS misdiagnosis isn't uncommon. An example study with 40 patients in the [[United Kingdom]] reported 43% of their patients classified as PVS were believed so and another 33% had recovered whilst the study was underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=K Andrews |author2=L Murphy |author3=R Munday |author4=C Littlewood | title=Misdiagnosis of the vegetative state: retrospective study in a rehabilitation unit | journal=[[British Medical Journal]] | volume=313 | pages=13–16 | date=1996-07-06 | pmid=8664760 | url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/313/7048/13 | issue=7048 | pmc=2351462 | doi=10.1136/bmj.313.7048.13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some PVS cases may actually be a misdiagnosis of patients being in an undiagnosed [[minimally conscious state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Giacino JT | title=Unknown title | journal=Neurology | volume=58 | year=2002 | pages=349–353 | pmid=11839831 | issue=3 |name-list-format=vanc | display-authors=1 | last2=Ashwal | first2=S | last3=Childs | first3=N | last4=Cranford | first4=R | last5=Jennett | first5=B | last6=Katz | first6=DI | last7=Kelly | first7=JP | last8=Rosenberg | first8=JH | last9=Whyte | first9=J | doi=10.1212/wnl.58.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the exact diagnostic criteria of the minimally conscious state were only formulated in 2002, there may be chronic patients diagnosed as PVS before the secondary notion of the minimally conscious state became known.

Whether or not there is any conscious awareness with a patient's vegetative state is a prominent issue.  Three completely different aspects of this should be distinguished. First, some patients can be conscious simply because they are misdiagnosed (see above). In fact, they are not in vegetative states. Second, sometimes a patient was correctly diagnosed but is then examined during the early stages of recovery. Third, perhaps some day the notion itself of vegetative states will change so to include elements of conscious awareness. Inability to disentangle these three example cases causes confusion. An example of such confusion is the response to a recent experiment using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] which revealed that a woman diagnosed with PVS was able to activate predictable portions of her brain in response to the tester's requests that she imagine herself playing tennis or moving from room to room in her house. The brain activity in response to these instructions was indistinguishable from those of healthy patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Owen AM, Coleman MR, Boly M, Davis MH, Laureys S, Pickard JD | title=Detecting awareness in the vegetative state | journal=Science | volume=313 | issue=5792 | page=1402 | date=2006-09-08 | doi=10.1126/science.1130197 | pmid=16959998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC news "&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/5320234.stm | title= Vegetative patient 'communicates': A patient in a vegetative state can communicate just through using her thoughts, according to research | date= September 7, 2006| publisher=BBC News | accessdate=2008-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/09/08/MNGI9L1IM81.DTL | title=Vegetative patient's brain active  in test: Unprecedented experiment shows response to instructions to imagine playing tennis | author=Stein R | date=September 8, 2006 | publisher= ''San Francisco Chronicle''| accessdate=2007-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Martin Monti and fellow researchers, working at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at the [[University of Cambridge]], reported in an article in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/362/7/579 Willful Modulation of Brain Activity in Disorders of Consciousness at nejm.org]&lt;/ref&gt; that some patients in persistent vegetative states responded to verbal instructions by displaying different patterns of brain activity on [[fMRI]] scans. Five out of a total of 54 diagnosed patients were apparently able to respond when instructed to think about one of two different physical activities. One of these five was also able to "answer" yes or no questions, again by imagining one of these two activities.&lt;ref name="alleynebeckford"&gt;Richard Alleyne and Martin Beckford, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7150119/Patients-in-vegetative-state-can-think-and-communicate.html Patients in 'vegetative' state can think and communicate],''Telegraph'' (United Kingdom), Feb 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear, however, whether the fact that portions of the patients' brains light up on [[fMRI]] could help these patients assume their own medical decision making.&lt;ref name="alleynebeckford"/&gt;

In November 2011, a publication in ''The Lancet'' presented bedside EEG apparatus and indicated that its signal could be used to detect awareness in three of 16 patients diagnosed in the vegetative state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cruse Damian| title = Bedside detection of awareness in the vegetative state: a cohort study | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 378| issue = 9809| pages = 2088–2094| doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61224-5 |display-authors=etal | pmid=22078855 | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Currently no treatment for vegetative state exists that would satisfy the efficacy criteria of [[evidence-based medicine]]. Several methods have been proposed which can roughly be subdivided into four categories: pharmacological methods, surgery, physical therapy, and various stimulation techniques. Pharmacological therapy mainly uses activating substances such as [[tricyclic antidepressants]] or [[methylphenidate]]. Mixed results have been reported using dopaminergic drugs such as [[amantadine]] and [[bromocriptine]] and stimulants such as [[dextroamphetamine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dolce|first1=Giuliano|last2=Sazbon|first2=Leon|title=The post-traumatic vegetative state|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_post_traumatic_vegetative_state.html?id=tvY4pNyemisC|isbn=9781588901163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surgical methods such as deep brain stimulation are used less frequently due to the invasiveness of the procedures. Stimulation techniques include sensory stimulation, sensory regulation, music and musicokinetic therapy, social-tactile interaction, and cortical stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Georgiopoulos M, etal | year = 2010 | title = Vegetative state and minimally conscious state: a review of the therapeutic interventions | url = http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/314354 | journal = Stereotact Funct Neurosurg | volume = 88 | issue = 4| pages = 199–207 | pmid = 20460949 | doi=10.1159/000314354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zolpidem===

In the [[United States]], it is estimated that there may be between 15,000 and 40,000 patients who are in a persistent vegetative state, but due to poor nursing home records exact figures are hard to determine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hirsch, Joy |  title=Raising consciousness | volume=115 | issue=5 | date=2005-05-02 | page=1102 | publisher=American Society for Clinical Investigation |url=http://www.jci.org/cgi/content/full/115/5/1102 |  doi=10.1172/JCI25320 | pmid=15864333 | pmc=1087197 | journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Ethics and policy===
An ongoing debate exists as to how much care, if any, patients in a persistent vegetative state should receive in health systems plagued by limited resources.  In a case before the New Jersey Superior Court, ''[[Betancourt v. Trinitas Hospital]]'', a community hospital sought a ruling that dialysis and CPR for such a patient constitutes futile care.  An American bioethicist, [[Jacob M. Appel]], argued that any money spent treating PVS patients would be better spent on other patients with a higher likelihood of recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medicalfutility.blogspot.com/ Appel on Betancourt v. Trinitas]&lt;/ref&gt;
The patient died naturally prior to a decision in the case, resulting in the court finding the issue [[mootness|moot]].

In 2010, British and Belgian researchers reported in an article in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' that some patients in persistent vegetative states actually had enough consciousness to "answer" yes or no questions on [[fMRI]] scans.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;Richard Alleyne and Martin Beckford, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7150119/Patients-in-vegetative-state-can-think-and-communicate.html Patients in 'vegetative' state can think and communicate], ''Telegraph'' (United Kingdom), Feb 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unclear whether the fact that portions of the patients' brains light up on [[fMRI]] will help these patient assume their own medical decision making.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; Professor Geraint Rees, Director of the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London, responded to the study by observing that, "As a clinician, it would be important to satisfy oneself that the individual that you are communicating with is competent to make those decisions. At the moment it is premature to conclude that the individual able to answer 5 out of 6 yes/no questions is fully conscious like you or I."&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; In contrast, [[Jacob M. Appel]] of the [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]] told the ''Telegraph'' that this development could be a welcome step toward clarifying the wishes of such patients. Appel stated: "I see no reason why, if we are truly convinced such patients are communicating, society should not honour their wishes. In fact, as a physician, I think a compelling case can be made that doctors have an ethical obligation to assist such patients by removing treatment. I suspect that, if such individuals are indeed trapped in their bodies, they may be living in great torment and will request to have their care terminated or even active euthanasia."&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

'''Private browsing''', '''privacy mode''' or '''incognito mode''' is a privacy feature in some [[web browser]]s to disable [[Web browsing history|browsing history]] and the [[web cache]]. This allows a person to browse the [[World Wide Web|Web]] without storing local data that could be retrieved at a later date. Privacy mode will also disable{{dubious|Disabling cookies?| reason=Not only until you close the browser?|date=October 2018}} the storage of data in [[HTTP cookie|cookies]] and [[Local shared object|Flash cookies]]. This privacy protection is only within the browser application as it may leave traces on the hard drive and memory of the device,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Verger |first1=Rob |title=Your private browsing isn’t as incognito as you want it to be |url=https://www.popsci.com/private-browsing |accessdate=15 September 2018 |date=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or via websites by associating the [[IP address]] at the [[web server]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howtogeek.com/117776/htg-explains-how-private-browsing-works-and-why-it-doesnt-offer-complete-privacy/|title=HTG Explains: How Private Browsing Works and Why It Doesn't Offer Complete Privacy|publisher=How-To Geek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest reference to private browsing was in May 2005, and was used to discuss the privacy features in the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] browser bundled with [[Mac OS X Tiger]].&lt;ref name="lifehack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/software/mac-os-x/safaris-private-porn-browsing-mode-102146.php|title=Safari's private (porn) browsing mode|last=Trapani|first=Gina|authorlink=Gina Trapani|date=May 4, 2005|publisher=[[Lifehacker]]|accessdate=2010-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feature has since been adopted in other browsers, and led to popularization of the term in 2008 by mainstream news outlets and computing websites when discussing [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta]] versions of [[Internet Explorer 8]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1550|title=Microsoft to roll out more granular 'porn mode' with IE 8|first=Mary Jo|last=Foley|publisher=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=2008-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redherring.com/Home/24763|title=Microsoft's Internet Explorer 8 Goes 'Porn Mode'|first=Lalee|last=Sadighi|publisher=[[Red Herring (magazine)|Red Herring]]|accessdate=2008-10-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912040417/http://www.redherring.com/Home/24763|archivedate=2008-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apcmag.com/microsoft_releases_ie8_beta_2.htm|title=Microsoft releases IE8 beta 2: MS porn mode included|first=Angus|last=Kidman|publisher=[[APC (magazine)|APC]]|accessdate=2008-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, privacy modes operate as shields because browsers typically do not remove all data from the cache after the session. [[Plug-in (computing)|Plug-ins]], like [[Microsoft Silverlight|Silverlight]], are able to set cookies that will not be removed after the session.

The common web browser plugin [[Adobe Flash Player]] began supporting privacy mode in [[Google Chrome|Chrome]], [[Firefox]], [[Internet Explorer|Internet Explorer,]] and Safari with the release of version 10.1 in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xu|first1=Jimson|last2=Nguyen|first2=Tom|title=Private browsing in Flash Player 10.1 |url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/privacy_mode_fp10_1.html|publisher=[[Adobe Systems]]|accessdate=14 January 2011|date=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
Some browsers (like Internet Explorer 8) allow users to select the privacy mode for single [[Tab (GUI)|tabs]], whereas others create a more [[Interface segregation principle|isolated]] environment protected by [[password]] and [[cryptography]].

==Uses==
Private browsing has multiple uses, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/7-situations-where-you-should-use-private-browsing-mode-179175|title=7 Great Uses for Your Browser's Private Browsing Mode|first=Taryn|last=Fiol|date=23 October 2012|publisher=Apartment Therapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/5-great-reasons-why-you-should-use-private-browsing-online-0140619/|title=5 Great Reasons Why You Should Use Private Browsing Online|first=Osas|last=Obaiza|publisher=Null Byte}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/5620502/nine-great-uses-for-private-browsing-that-dont-involve-porn|title=Nine Great Uses for Private Browsing that Don't Involve Porn|first=Adam|last=Pash|publisher=Lifehacker|date=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Reducing history, including [[autofill]], browsing, and personal information.
*Performing "pure searches" that are not influenced by prior browsing history or networks or friends' recommendations, which may weight and more highly rank certain results than others.
*Preventing accidental saving of [[login]] credentials to [[User (computing)#User account|accounts]].
*Signing into multiple accounts simultaneously, via multiple [[Tab (GUI)|tabs]].
*Testing websites.
*Preventing other users of the computer from finding one's search history.
*Viewing explicit material without outside knowledge.

The [[Mozilla Foundation]] performed a study about the user behavior when the feature is switched on and how long the session lasts. The results were that most sessions last only about 10 minutes, though there are periods where activation increases; usually around 11&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 2&amp;nbsp;p.m., 5&amp;nbsp;p.m., between 9&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 10&amp;nbsp;p.m., and a minor peak about an hour or two after midnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ulmer|first=Hamilton|title=Understanding Private Browsing|url=http://blog.mozilla.com/metrics/2010/08/23/understanding-private-browsing/|work=Blog of Metrics|publisher=[[Mozilla Foundation]]|accessdate=24 August 2010|date=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security==
In 2012, [[Brazil|Brazilian]] researchers published the results of a research project&lt;ref&gt;R. Ruiz, F. P. Amatte, K. J. B. Park, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258491690_Making_the_In_Private_Navigation_as_Public_%28Tornando_Pblica_a_Navegao_In_Private%29_Portuguese Tornando Pública a Navegação “In Private”]. Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Forensic Computer Science – ICoFCS 2012, Available online Sep 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; where they applied [[Computer forensics|forensic]] techniques (namely the Foremost data carving tool and Strings program) to extract information about the users browsing activities on Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers with their private mode enabled. They were able to collect enough data to identify pages visited and even partially reconstruct them.

This research was later extended&lt;ref&gt;R. Ruiz, F. P. Amatte, K. J. B. Park, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271497300_Opening_the__Private_Browsing__Data__Acquiring_Evidence_of_Browsing_Activities Opening the “Private Browsing” Data – Acquiring Evidence of Browsing Activities]. Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Security and Cyber Forensics (InfoSec2014), Available online Oct 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; to include Chrome and Safari browsers. The gathered data proved that browsers' private mode implementations are not able to fully hide users' browsing activities and that browsers in private mode leave traces of activities in caching structures and files related to the [[paging]] process of the [[operating system]].

Another independent security analysis, performed by a group of researchers at [[Newcastle University]] in 2014, shows a range of security vulnerabilities in the implementation of the private mode across four major browsers ([[Internet Explorer|IE]], [[Firefox]], [[Google Chrome|Chrome]] and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]]).&lt;ref&gt;K. Satvat, M. Forshaw, F. Hao, E. Toreini, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jisa.2014.02.002 On the privacy of private browsing – A forensic approach]. Journal of Information Security and Applications, In Press, Available online 3 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The results are summarized below.
# [[Browser extension|Browser extensions]] are potential threats to the user privacy. By design, existing browsers (e.g., Firefox, Safari) commonly choose to enable extensions in the private mode by default. This however allows an installed extension to secretly record the visited websites without the user's awareness. Newer versions of Chrome disable extensions in the private mode by default, but allow the private and the normal modes to run in parallel. This makes it possible for an installed extension in the normal mode to learn the user activities in the private mode by measuring the usage of shared computing resources.  
# Data erasure by the browser alone is found to be insufficient. For example, the records of visited websites during the private session can be retained in memory for a long time even after the private session is closed. In addition, the visited website records are usually kept by the operating system in the local [[Domain Name System|DNS]] cache. Furthermore, the modified timestamps of certain profile files saved on the disk may reveal if the private mode was previously turned on and when it was turned on.
# [[Software bug|Software bugs]] present in some browsers are found to seriously degrade the security of the private mode. For example, in some earlier versions of Safari, the browser retained private browsing history records if the browser program was not closed normally (e.g., as a result of program crash), or if the user acted to add a [[Bookmark (World Wide Web)|bookmark]] within the private mode. 
# Depending on whether the session is in the private or the normal mode, web browsers typically exhibit different [[User interface|user interfaces]] and traffic characteristics. This allows a remote website to tell if the user is currently in the private mode, for example, by checking the color of the hyperlinks or measuring the time of writing cookies. (The fact that the user is using the private mode should be considered protected information as well.)

In 2010, professors at [[Stanford University]] found that while Firefox won't record your history during a private browsing session, it still records the sites on which you've installed [[Public key certificate#TLS/SSL client certificate|SSL certificates]] (which enable secure, encrypted information exchange indicated by the "[[HTTPS|https]]" in front of the [[URL]]) and allows specific permissions. If you download an SSL certificate from a website or told that site specifically to stop displaying [[Modal window|pop-ups]] and downloading cookies, all of that information is still stored on Firefox.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

In 2015, researchers from [[Pennsylvania State University]] found that a considerable amount of extensions on Firefox violated the private browsing policy based on an investigation of the top 2,000 extensions.&lt;ref&gt;B. Zhao, P. Liu, [http://s2.ist.psu.edu/paper/DSN_CameraReady-Bin-Zhao-PBM-18March2015.pdf Private Browsing Mode Not Really That Private: Dealing with Privacy Breaches Caused by Browser Extensions]. In Proceedings of the 45th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2015), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Available online June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Many extensions maintain their own profile folders on the local machine, and most of them will not wipe the browsing data after the private browsing session ends. This violation even happens on some most popular extensions with millions of users on Firefox.

==Overview==
The question is general, rather than concerning the existence of anything specific such as the [[universe]] or [[multiverse]], the [[Big Bang]], [[mathematics|mathematical laws]], [[physical law]]s, [[time]], [[consciousness]] or [[God]]. It can be seen as an open [[metaphysical]] question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metaphysics special: Why is there something rather than nothing?|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23130890-400-metaphysics-special-why-is-there-something-rather-than-nothing/|publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sorensen|first1=Roy|title=Nothingness|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nothingness/|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=26 April 2017|date=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dascal|first1=Marcelo|title=Leibniz: What Kind of Rationalist?|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781402086687|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=Da_oP3sJs1oC&amp;pg=PA452|page=452|language=en|date=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldschmidt|first1=Tyron|title=The Puzzle of Existence: Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing?|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136249228|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=3XDMAgAAQBAJ|language=en|date=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the question's adequacy==

Some argue that the question may be inherently illogical; if the universe had no beginning point then its non-existence might never have been an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Lynds|first1=Peter|title=Why there is something rather than nothing: The finite, infinite and eternal|eprint=1205.2720|date=10 January 2012|class=physics.gen-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study has suggested a model that eliminates the [[initial singularity]] and predicts that the Universe had no beginning but existed forever as a kind of quantum [[potential]] before 'collapsing' into the Big Bang's hot dense state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What if the universe had no beginning?|url=http://earthsky.org/space/what-if-the-universe-had-no-beginning|website=earthsky.org|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kosmologie: Quantentrick schafft Urknall-Singularität ab|url=http://www.spektrum.de/news/quantentrick-schafft-urknall-singularitaet-ab/1332377|accessdate=26 April 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ein Universum ohne Urknall, Dunkle Materie und Dunkle Energie|url=http://www.forschung-und-wissen.de/nachrichten/astronomie/ein-universum-ohne-urknall-dunkle-materie-und-dunkle-energie-13372141|website=Forschung und Wissen|accessdate=26 April 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other research a possible consequence of "[[rainbow gravity]]" might be that the universe had no beginning with time stretching back infinitely without an initial singularity and Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moskowitz|first1=Clara|title=In a "Rainbow" Universe Time May Have No Beginning|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rainbow-gravity-universe-beginning/|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=26 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly physics may conclude that [[time]] did not exist before the Big Bang, but 'started' with the &lt;!--beginning point--&gt;Big Bang and hence there might be no 'beginning', 'before' or potentially 'cause' and instead always existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Big Bang?

Philosopher [[Stephen Law]] has said the question may not need answering, as it is attempting to answer a question that is outside a spatio-temporal setting, from within a spatio-temporal setting. He compares the question to asking "what is north of the North Pole?"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.closertotruth.com/series/why-there-something-rather-nothing Stephen Law - Closer To Truth]&lt;/ref&gt;

==On causation==
Ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] argued that the notion of an [[uncaused cause]] was non-sensical, and that the [[Eternity of the world|universe was eternal]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

[[David Hume]] argued that, whilst we expect everything to have a cause because of our experience of the necessity of causes, a cause may not be necessary in the case of the formation of the universe, which is outside our experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gutting|first1=Gary|title=Talking God: Philosophers on Belief|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=9780393352825|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=O96aCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT55|language=en|date=2016-11-22}}{{pn|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] said "I should say that the universe is just there, and that's all",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strangenotions.com/5-reasons-why-the-universe-cant-be-merely-a-brute-fact/|title=5 Reasons Why the Universe Can't Be Merely a Brute Fact : Strange Notions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "[[brute fact]]" position also taken by physicist [[Sean M.

Philosopher [[Brian Leftow]] has argued that the question cannot have a causal explanation (as any cause must itself have a cause) or a contingent explanation (as the factors giving the contingency must pre-exist), and that if there is an answer it must be something that exists necessarily (i.e. something that just exists, rather than is caused).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.closertotruth.com/series/why-there-something-rather-nothing Brian Leftow - Closer To Truth]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anarchism sidebar |Theory}}
'''Propaganda of the deed''' (or '''propaganda by the deed''', from the French ''propagande par le fait'') is specific political action meant to be exemplary to others and serve as a catalyst for revolution.

It is primarily associated with acts of violence perpetrated by proponents of [[insurrectionary anarchism]] in the late 19th and early 20th century, including bombings and [[assassinations]] aimed at the [[ruling class]], but also had [[Nonviolent resistance|non-violent]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;Anarchist historian [[George Woodcock]], when dealing with the evolution of [[anarcho-pacifism]] in the early 20th century, reports that "the modern pacifist anarchists, ...have tended to concentrate their attention largely on the creation of [[intentional community|libertarian communities]] – particularly farming communities – within present society, as a kind of peaceful version of the propaganda by deed." [[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'' (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; These "deeds" were to ignite the "spirit of revolt" in the people by demonstrating the state was not omnipotent and by offering hope to the downtrodden, and also to expand support for anarchist movements as the state grew more repressive in its response.&lt;ref name="Merriman"/&gt; In 1881, the [[International Anarchist Congresses|International Anarchist Congress of London]] gave the tactic its approval.&lt;ref name="Abidor"/&gt;

==Anarchist origins==

===Various definitions===

One of the first individuals to conceptualise propaganda by the deed was the Italian revolutionary [[Carlo Pisacane]] (1818–57), who wrote in his "Political Testament" (1857) that "ideas spring from deeds and not the other way around."&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; [[Mikhail Bakunin]] (1814–1876), in his "Letters to a Frenchman on the Present Crisis" (1870) stated that "we must spread our principles, not with words but with deeds, for this is the most popular, the most potent, and the most irresistible form of propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;[http://marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1870/letter-frenchman.htm "Letter to a Frenchman on the Present Crisis" (1870) by Mikhail Bakunin]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept, in a broader setting, has a rich heritage, as the words of [[Francis of Assisi]] reveal: "Let them show their love by the works they do for each other, according as the Apostle says: 'let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.{{' "}}
[[File:Johannmost.jpg|thumb|left|120px|[[Johann Most]]]]
Some anarchists, such as [[Johann Most]], advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because "we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/most/actionprop.html "Action as Propaganda" by Johann Most, July 25, 1885]&lt;/ref&gt; It was not advocacy for mass murder, but a call for [[targeted killings]] of the representatives of capitalism and government at a time when such action might garner sympathy from the population, such as during periods of government repression or labor conflicts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gage|first=Beverly|title=The Day Wall Street Exploded: A Story of America in its First Age of Terror|location=New York|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|ISBN=978-0199759286|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YDxnDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Most himself once boasted that "the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kill-the-banker-0000525-v21n12|title=When Revolution Came to America|last=Ketcham |first=Christopher |date= December 16, 2014|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |publisher= |access-date=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1885, he published ''The Science of Revolutionary Warfare'',&lt;ref&gt;''Revolutionäre Kriegswissenschaft: Eine Handbüchlein zur Anleitung Betreffend Gebrauches und Herstellung von Nitro-Glycerin, Dynamit, Schiessbaumwolle, Knallquecksilber, Bomben, Brandsätzen, Giften usw., usw.''

New York: Internationaler Zeitung-Verein, 1885; Desert Publications, 1978 (reprint). {{ISBN|0879472111}}&lt;/ref&gt; a technical manual for acquiring and detonating explosives based on the knowledge he acquired by working at an explosives factory in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gage|first=Beverly|title=The Day Wall Street Exploded: A Story of America in its First Age of Terror|location=New York|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|ISBN=978-0199759286|page=49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YDxnDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most was an early influence on American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]]. Berkman attempted propaganda by the deed when he tried in 1892 to kill industrialist [[Henry Clay Frick]] following the deaths by shooting of several [[Homestead Strike|striking]] workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/berkman/prison/chapter4.html ''Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist'' (1912) by Alexander Berkman]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beverly Gage, professor of U.S. history at [[Yale University]], elaborates on what the concept meant to outsiders and those within the anarchist movement:

{{Quote|To outsiders, the talk of bombing and assassination that suddenly pulsed through revolutionary circles in the late 1870s sounded like little more than an indiscriminate call to violence. To Most and others within the anarchist movement, by contrast, the idea of propaganda by deed, or the ''attentat'' (attack), had a very specific logic. Among anarchism's founding premises was the idea that capitalist society was a place of constant violence: every law, every church, every paycheck was based on force.  In such a world, to do nothing, to stand idly by while millions suffered, was itself to commit an act of violence. The question was not whether violence per se might be justified, but exactly ''how'' violence might be maximally effective for, in Most's words, annihilating the "beast of property" that "makes mankind miserable, and gains in cruelty and voracity with the progress of our so called ''civilization''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gage|first=Beverly|title=The Day Wall Street Exploded: A Story of America in its First Age of Terror|location=New York|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|ISBN=978-0199759286|pages=44–45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YDxnDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the 1880s, the slogan "propaganda of the deed" had begun to be used both within and outside of the anarchist movement to refer to individual bombings, [[regicide]]s and [[tyrannicide]]s. In 1881, "propaganda by the deed" was formally adopted as a strategy by the anarchist London Congress.&lt;ref name="Merriman"&gt;{{cite book |last= Merriman|first=John M.|date=2016 |title=The Dynamite Club: How a Bombing in Fin-de-Siècle Paris Ignited the Age of Modern Terror|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w8mtCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location= |publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|page=63 |isbn=978-0300217926}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1886, French anarchist [[Clément Duval]] achieved a form of propaganda of the deed, stealing 15,000 francs from the mansion of a Parisian socialite, before accidentally setting the house on fire. Caught two weeks later, he was dragged from the court crying "Long live anarchy!", and condemned to death. Duval's sentence was later commuted to hard labor on [[Devil's Island]], [[French Guiana]]. In the anarchist paper ''Révolte'', Duval famously declared that, "Theft exists only through the exploitation of man by man... when Society refuses you the right to exist, you must take it... the policeman arrested me in the name of the Law, I struck him in the name of Liberty".

As early as 1887, a few important figures in the anarchist movement had begun to distance themselves from individual acts of violence. [[Peter Kropotkin]] thus wrote that year in ''Le Révolté'' that "a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Billington, James H. 1998. ''Fire in the minds of men: origins of the revolutionary faith'' New Jersey: Transaction Books, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favor of collective revolutionary action, for example through the [[trade union]] movement. The [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]], [[Fernand Pelloutier]], argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labor movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without "the individual dynamiter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm |title=Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume One &amp;#124; Robert Graham |publisher=Black Rose Books |date= |accessdate=October 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political repression|State repression]] (including the infamous 1894 French ''[[lois scélérates]]'') of the anarchist and [[labor movement]]s following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French [[socialist movement]], into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], the execution and exile of many ''[[communards]]'' to [[penal colonies]], favored individualist political expression and acts.&lt;ref&gt;Historian [[Benedict Anderson]] thus writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;In March 1871 the Commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months. Then [[Adolphe Thiers|Versailles]] seized the moment to attack and, in one horrifying week, executed roughly 20,000 Communards or suspected sympathizers, a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during [[Robespierre]]’s ‘[[Reign of Terror|Terror]]’ of 1793–94. More than 7,500 were jailed or deported to places like New Caledonia. Thousands of others fled to Belgium, England, Italy, Spain and the United States. In 1872, stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organizing on the left. Not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned Communards. Meanwhile, the Third Republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]]’s imperialist expansion—in Indochina, Africa, and Oceania. Many of France’s leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the Commune ([[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] was its quasi-minister of culture, [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Pissarro]] were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. The ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter, was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the Third Republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad. {{Cite journal | last = Anderson | first = Benedict | author-link = Benedict Anderson | title = In the World-Shadow of Bismarck and Nobel | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = II | issue = 28 | pages = 85–129 | publisher = New Left Review | date = July–August 2004 | url = http://newleftreview.org/II/28/benedict-anderson-in-the-world-shadow-of-bismarck-and-nobel | ref = harv | postscript = .}}  &lt;/blockquote&gt; According to some analysts, in [[History of Germany since 1945|post-war Germany]], the prohibition of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] (KPD) and thus of institutional [[far-left politics|far-left political]] organization may also, in the same manner, have played a role in the creation of the [[Red Army Faction]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchist historian [[Max Nettlau]] provided a more complex concept of propaganda when he said that,

{{Quote|Every person is likely to be open to a different kind of argument, so propaganda cannot be diversified enough if we want to touch all. We want it to pervade and penetrate all the utterances of life, social and political, domestic and artistic, educational and recreational. There should be propaganda by word and action, the platform and the press, the street corner, the workshop, and the domestic circle, acts of revolt, and the example of our own lives as free men. Those who agree with each other may co-operate; otherwise they should prefer to work each on his own lines to trying to persuade one the other of the superiority of his own method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Max_Nettlau__An_Anarchist_Manifesto.html Max Nettlau. "An Anarchist Manifesto"]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Later anarchist authors advocating "propaganda of the deed" included the German anarchist [[Gustav Landauer]], and the Italians [[Errico Malatesta]] and [[Luigi Galleani]]. For Gustav Landauer, "propaganda of the deed" meant the creation of libertarian social forms and communities that would inspire others to transform society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gustav Landauer]], "Anarchism in Germany," 1895 [http://blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In "Weak Statesmen, Weaker People," he wrote that the state is not something "that one can smash in order to destroy. The state is a relationship between human beings... one destroys it by entering into other relationships."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm ''Der Sozialist'', (1910)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Errico Malatesta described "propaganda by the deed" as violent communal insurrections that were meant to ignite the imminent revolution.  However, Malatesta himself denounced the use of terrorism and violent physical force, stating in one of his essays:

{{Quote|Violence (physical force) used to another's hurt, which is the most brutal form of struggle between men can assume, is eminently corrupting. It tends, by its very nature, to suffocate the best sentiments of man, and to develop all the antisocial qualities, ferocity, hatred, revenge, the spirit of domination and tyranny, contempt of the weak, servility towards the strong. And this harmful tendency arises also when violence is used for a good end. ... Anarchists who rebel against every sort of oppression and struggle for the integral liberty of each and who ought thus to shrink instinctively from all acts of violence which cease to be mere resistance to oppression and become oppressive in their turn are also liable to fall into the abyss of brutal force. ... The excitement caused by some recent explosions and the admiration for the courage with which the bomb-throwers faced death, suffices to cause many anarchists to forget their program, and to enter on a path which is the most absolute negation of all anarchist ideas and sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm "Violence as a Social Factor," (1895) by Malatesta]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

At the other extreme, the anarchist Luigi Galleani, perhaps the most vocal proponent of "propaganda by the deed" from the turn of the century through the end of the First World War, took undisguised pride in describing himself as a subversive, a revolutionary propagandist and advocate of the violent overthrow of established government and institutions through the use of 'direct action', i.e., bombings and assassinations.&lt;ref name="GAL"&gt;Galleani, Luigi, ''La Fine Dell'Anarchismo?'', ed. Curata da Vecchi Lettori di Cronaca Sovversiva, University of Michigan (1925), pp. 61–62: Galleani's writings are clear on this point: he had undisguised contempt for those who refused to both advocate and ''directly participate'' in the violent overthrow of capitalism.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GAL2"&gt;Galleani, Luigi, ''Faccia a Faccia col Nemico'', Boston, MA: Gruppo Autonomo, (1914)&lt;/ref&gt; Galleani heartily embraced physical violence and terrorism, not only against symbols of the government and the capitalist system, such as courthouses and factories, but also through direct assassination of 'enemies of the people': capitalists, industrialists, politicians, judges, and policemen.&lt;ref name="GAL2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AVR1"&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background'', Princeton University Press (1991), pp. 51, 98–99&lt;/ref&gt;  He had a particular interest in the use of bombs, going so far as to include a formula for the explosive [[nitroglycerine]] in one of his pamphlets advertised through his monthly magazine, ''[[Cronaca Sovversiva]]''.&lt;ref name="AVR1"/&gt;  By all accounts, Galleani was an extremely effective speaker and advocate of his policy of violent action, attracting a number of devoted Italian-American anarchist followers who called themselves Galleanists.  Carlo Buda, the brother of Galleanist bombmaker [[Mario Buda]], said of him, "You heard Galleani speak, and you were ready to shoot the first policeman you saw".''&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America'', Princeton: Princeton University Press (1996), p. 132 (Interview of Charles Poggi)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illegalism===
{{Main|Illegalism}}
Propaganda of the deed is also related to illegalism, an anarchist philosophy that developed primarily in France, Italy, Belgium, and Switzerland during the early 20th century as an outgrowth of [[anarchist individualism]]. The illegalists openly embraced [[crime|criminality]] as a lifestyle. Influenced by theorist [[Max Stirner]]'s concept of "egoism", the illegalists broke from anarchists like [[Clément Duval]] and [[Marius Jacob]] who justified theft with a theory of [[individual reclamation]]. Instead, the illegalists argued that their actions required no [[Morality|moral]] basis&amp;nbsp;– illegal acts were taken not in the name of a higher ideal, but in pursuit of one's own desires. France's [[Bonnot Gang]] was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.

===Relationship to revolution===
[[File:Bomb French Chamber 1893.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's rendition of the bomb thrown by the anarchist [[Auguste Vaillant]] into the Chamber of Deputies of the French National Assembly in December, 1893]]Propaganda of the deed thus included stealing (in particular [[bank robbery|bank robberies]]&amp;nbsp;– named "expropriations" or "revolutionary expropriations" to finance the organization), rioting and [[general strike]]s which aimed at creating the conditions of an insurrection or even a revolution. These acts were justified as the necessary counterpart to state repression.  As early as 1911, [[Leon Trotsky]] condemned individual acts of violence by anarchists as useful for little more than providing an excuse for state repression. "The anarchist prophets of the 'propaganda by the deed' can argue all they want about the elevating and stimulating influence of terrorist acts on the masses," he wrote in 1911, "Theoretical considerations and political experience prove otherwise." [[Vladimir Lenin]] largely agreed, viewing individual anarchist acts of terrorism as an ineffective substitute for coordinated action by disciplined cadres of the masses. Both Lenin and Trotsky acknowledged the necessity of violent rebellion and assassination to serve as a catalyst for revolution, but they distinguished between the ''ad hoc'' bombings and assassinations carried out by proponents of the propaganda of the deed, and organized violence coordinated by a professional [[Vanguardism|revolutionary vanguard]] utilized for that specific end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gage|first=Beverly|title=The Day Wall Street Exploded: A Story of America in its First Age of Terror|location=New York|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|ISBN=978-0199759286|page=263|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YDxnDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA263#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Max Weber]] wrote that the state has a "[[monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force]]", or, in [[Karl Marx]]'s words, the state was only the repressive apparatus of the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois class]]. Propaganda by the deed, including [[assassination]]s (sometimes involving bombs, named in French "''machines infernales''"&amp;nbsp;– "hellish machines", usually made with bombs, sometimes only several guns assembled together), were thus legitimized by part of the anarchist movement and the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]] as a valid means to be used in [[class struggle]]. The predictable state responses to these actions were supposed to display to the [[people]] the inherently repressive nature of the bourgeois state, delegitimizing it (legitimacy being key). This would in turn bolster the revolutionary spirit of the people, leading to the overthrow of the state. This is the basic formula of the cycle protests-repression-protests, which in specific conditions may lead to an effective state of insurrection.

This cycle has been observed during the [[1905 Russian Revolution]] or in Paris in May 1968. However, it failed to achieve its revolutionary objective on the vast majority of occasions, thus leading to the abandonment by the vast majority of the anarchist movement of such bombings.  However, the state never failed in its repressive response, enforcing various ''[[lois scélérates]]'' which usually involved tough [[clampdown]]s on the whole of the [[labor movement]]. These harsh laws, sometimes accompanied by the proclamation of the [[state of exception]], progressively led to increased criticism among the anarchist movement of assassinations. The role of several ''[[agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]]'' and the use of deliberate [[strategy of tension|strategies of tension]] by governments, using such [[false flag]] terrorist actions as the Spanish [[La Mano Negra]], work to discredit this violent tactic in the eyes of most socialist libertarians. [[John Filiss]] and [[Jim Bell]] are two of the best known modern advocates, with the latter developing the concept of an [[assassination market]]{{mdash}}a market system for anonymously hiring and compensating political assassination.

==Justifications==
{{details|Anarchism and violence}}

The [[United Nations Security Council]], acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter&lt;ref&gt;Acting under Chapter VII means the Council is speaking with its mandatory authority in matters of world security to set the world's policy around this issue. (Comparable to the Pope speaking [[ex cathedra]].)&lt;/ref&gt; defined the term "[[terrorism]]" as consisting of "Criminal acts, including against civilians, committed with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, or taking of hostages, with the purpose to provoke a state of terror in the general public or in a group of persons or particular persons, intimidate a population or compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act."&lt;ref name="UNSCR-1566-DefinitionOfTerrorism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undemocracy.com/S-RES-1566(2004)/page_2|title=Definition of Terrorism|last=[[Security Council]]|first=[[United Nations Organization]]|date=October 2004|work=Security Council Resolution 1566 (2004)|publisher=UNdemocracy.org|page=2|language=Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish|accessdate=May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of political violence is understood by its proponents in the frame of a general conception of the state as the control apparatus of the bourgeoisie, and of [[class struggle]] as a form of effective [[civil war]]. Thus, as anarchists often put it, "[[peace]] without [[justice]] isn't peace", but war between exploited and exploiters. In their eyes, this "social war" morally legitimizes the use of violence against broader "social violence." This view, of course, is not shared by pacifist libertarians. Rioting is thus justified as a means to enhance class consciousness and prepares the objective conditions for a popular uprising ([[Georges Sorel]], 1906).

Even those who are not opposed to the political use of violence for theoretical reasons (as pacifist anarchists are) may consider it unnecessary or [[strategy|strategically]] dangerous, in certain conditions. Many note that the events of 1970s showed clearly how terrorism may be used to influence politics in the frame of the "[[strategy of tension]]" by a state and its secret services, through [[Agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]] and [[false flag]] terrorist attacks. In Italy and other countries, the [[Years of lead (Italy)|Years of lead]] led to reinforced [[anti-terrorism legislation]], criticized by social activists as a new form of ''lois scélérates'' which were used to repress the whole of the socialist movement, not just militant groups. Many also note that the rare cases in which terrorism has achieved its revolutionary aims are mostly in the context of national liberation struggles, while the urban guerrilla movements have all failed ([[Gérard Chaliand]]).

==Armed propaganda==
'''Armed propaganda''' is a type of [[propaganda]] used by [[revolutionary]] organizations that uses destructive, but ideally not lethal violence to make a political point known to the public and eventually gain supporters for its cause. The term was used in the United States by the [[Weather Underground]] and the [[Black Panther Party]] to describe some of their bombings. Although armed propaganda can use guns or bombs, its proponents argue that its goal is debatably different from that of pure [[terrorism]].

===United States===
Dan Berger, in his book about the Weatherman organization, ''Outlaws in America'', describes the planning section for a townhouse bombing by the group, describing the action as "armed propaganda".&lt;ref name=db&gt;Berger, Dan, ''Outlaws of America: The Weather Underground and the Politics of Solidarity'', AK Press: Oakland, California, 2006, {{ISBN|1-904859-41-0}} p. 144;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
The term has been applied to guerillas in Latin America in their revolutionary literature.&lt;ref name=Vahabzadeh&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vahabzadeh|first1=Peyman|title=Guerrilla Odyssey: Modernization, Secularism, Democracy, and the Fadai Period of National Liberation In Iran, 1971–1979|date=2010|publisher=Syracuse University Press|page=100|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=3cCs4FFWMqgC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=%22armed+propaganda%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z_t_TdPag3&amp;sig=NFmhvkK3cJPcI8_KycFwHqHkQ0E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi20cym5ZjKAhXEOiYKHZWpANI4ChDoAQggMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22armed%20propaganda%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6347">In [[mathematics]], '''quaternionic projective space''' is an extension of the ideas of [[real projective space]] and [[complex projective space]], to the case where coordinates lie in the ring of [[quaternion]]s &lt;math&gt;\H.&lt;/math&gt; Quaternionic projective space of dimension ''n'' is usually denoted by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^n&lt;/math&gt;

and is a [[closed manifold]] of (real) dimension 4''n''. It is a [[homogeneous space]] for a [[Lie group]] action, in more than one way. The quaternionic projective line &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^1&lt;/math&gt; is homeomorphic to the 4-sphere.

==In coordinates==
Its direct construction is as a special case of the [[projective space over a division algebra]]. The [[homogeneous coordinates]] of a point can be written

:&lt;math&gt;[q_0,q_1,\ldots,q_n]&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; are quaternions, not all zero. Two sets of coordinates represent the same point if they are 'proportional' by a left multiplication by a non-zero quaternion ''c''; that is, we identify all the

:&lt;math&gt;[cq_0,cq_1\ldots,cq_n]&lt;/math&gt;.

In the language of [[group action]]s, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[orbit space]] of &lt;math&gt;\H^{n+1}\setminus\{(0,\ldots,0)\}&lt;/math&gt; by the action of &lt;math&gt;\H^{\times}&lt;/math&gt;, the multiplicative group of non-zero quaternions. By first projecting onto the unit sphere inside &lt;math&gt;\H^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; one may also regard &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; as the orbit space of &lt;math&gt;S^{4n+3}&lt;/math&gt; by the action of &lt;math&gt;\text{Sp}(1)&lt;/math&gt;, the group of unit quaternions.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory L. Naber, ''Topology, geometry, and gauge fields: foundations'' (1997), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The sphere &lt;math&gt;S^{4n+3}&lt;/math&gt; then becomes a [[principal bundle|principal Sp(1)-bundle]] over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^n&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Sp}(1) \to S^{4n+3} \to \mathbb{HP}^n.&lt;/math&gt;

This bundle is sometimes called a (generalized) [[Hopf fibration]].

There is also a construction of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; by means of two-dimensional complex subspaces of &lt;math&gt;\H^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; lies inside a complex [[Grassmannian]].

==Topology==
===Homotopy theory===
The space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;, defined as the union of all finite &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^n&lt;/math&gt;'s under inclusion, is the [[classifying space]] ''BS''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The homotopy groups of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; are given by &lt;math&gt;\pi_i(\mathbb{HP}^{\infty}) = \pi_i(BS^3) \cong \pi_{i-1}(S^3).&lt;/math&gt; These groups are known to be very complex and in particular they are non-zero for infinitely many values of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. However, we do have that

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_i(\mathbb{HP}^\infty) \otimes \Q \cong \begin{cases} \Q &amp; i = 4 \\ 0 &amp; i \neq 4 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that rationally, i.e. after [[localisation of a space]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Eilenberg–Maclane space]] &lt;math&gt;K(\Q,4)&lt;/math&gt;. That is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^{\infty}_{\Q} \simeq K(\Z, 4)_{\Q}.&lt;/math&gt; (cf. the example [[K(Z,2)]]). See [[rational homotopy theory]].

In general, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^n&lt;/math&gt; has a cell structure with one cell in each dimension which is a multiple of 4, up to &lt;math&gt;4n&lt;/math&gt;. Accordingly, its cohomology ring is &lt;math&gt;\Z[v]/v^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is a 4-dimensional generator. This is analogous to complex projective space. It also follows from rational homotopy theory that &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^n&lt;/math&gt; has infinite homotopy groups only in dimensions 4 and &lt;math&gt;4n+3&lt;/math&gt;.

==Differential geometry==

&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^n&lt;/math&gt; carries a natural [[Riemannian metric]] analogous to the [[Fubini-Study metric]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{CP}^n&lt;/math&gt;, with respect to which it is a compact [[quaternion-Kähler symmetric space]] with positive curvature.

Quaternionic projective space can be represented as the coset space

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^n = \operatorname{Sp}(n+1)/\operatorname{Sp}(n)\times\operatorname{Sp}(1)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Sp}(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the compact [[symplectic group]].

===Characteristic classes===

Since &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^1=S^4&lt;/math&gt;, its tangent bundle is stably trivial. The tangent bundles of the rest have nontrivial [[Stiefel–Whitney class|Stiefel–Whitney]] and [[Pontryagin class]]es. The total classes are given by the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;w(\mathbb{HP}^n) = (1+u)^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p(\mathbb{HP}^n) = (1+v)^{2n+2} (1+4v)^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the generator of &lt;math&gt;H^4(\mathbb{HP}^n;\Z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is its reduction mod 2.&lt;ref&gt;Szczarba, R. H. (1964). On tangent bundles of fibre spaces and quotient spaces. American Journal of Mathematics, 86(4), 685-697.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special cases==

===Quaternionic projective line===
The one-dimensional projective space over &lt;math&gt;\H&lt;/math&gt; is called the "projective line" in generalization of the [[complex projective line]]. For example, it was used (implicitly) in 1947 by P. G. Gormley to extend the [[Möbius group]] to the quaternion context with "linear fractional transformations". For the linear fractional transformations of an associative [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] with 1, see [[projective line over a ring]] and the homography group GL(2,''A'').

From the topological point of view the quaternionic projective line is the 4-sphere, and in fact these are [[diffeomorphic]] manifolds. The fibration mentioned previously is from the 7-sphere, and is an example of a [[Hopf fibration]].

===Quaternionic projective plane===
The 8-dimensional &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; has a [[circle action]], by the group of complex scalars of absolute value 1 acting on the other side (so on the right, as the convention for the action of ''c'' above is on the left). Therefore, the [[quotient manifold]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{HP}^{2}/\mathrm{U}(1)&lt;/math&gt;

may be taken, writing [[U(1)]] for the [[circle group]]. It has been shown that this quotient is the 7-[[sphere]], a result of [[Vladimir Arnold]] from 1996, later rediscovered by [[Edward Witten]] and [[Michael Atiyah]].

Many international treaties contain clear articulations of the right to protest and it is crucial for individuals who are interested in protesting to stay up to date and aware. Such agreements include the 1950 [[European Convention on Human Rights]], especially Articles 9 to 11; and the 1966 [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], especially Articles 18 to 22. Articles 9 enunciates the "right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms] and/or ''[https://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]'' Office of the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights&lt;/ref&gt; Article 10 enunciates the "right to freedom of expression."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Article 11 enunciates the "right to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, in these and other agreements the rights of freedom of assembly, freedom of association, and freedom of speech are subject to certain limitations. For example, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] contains prohibitions on "[[propaganda]] of war" and advocacy of "national, racial or religious [[hatred]]"; and it allows the restriction of the freedom to assembly if it is necessary "in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others." (Articles 20 and 21)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is important for people interested in protest to note that different places have passed their own clarification of these rights.

Protesting, however, is not necessarily violent or a threat to the interests of national security or public safety. Nor is it necessarily [[civil disobedience]], because most protest does not involve violating the laws of the state. Also, since it is an expression of a universal right, choosing to lawfully protest is not a violation of state laws. Protests, even campaigns of [[nonviolent resistance]] or [[civil resistance]], can often have the character (in addition to using nonviolent methods) of positively supporting a democratic and constitutional order. This can happen, for example, when such resistance arises in response to a military [[coup d'état]];&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]], "Civil Resistance to Military Coups", ''[[Journal of Peace Research]]'', Oslo, vol. 12, no. 1, 1975, pp. 19-36.&lt;/ref&gt; or in the somewhat similar case of a refusal of the state leadership to surrender office following defeat in an election. During points of widespread tension or controversy within a society, it is important for government institutions to recognize this right. A democracy's ability to preserve its citizen's right to protest is a result of that democracy's "political health."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4668">The '''Rokeach Value Survey''' ('''RVS''') is a [[value (personal and cultural)|value]]s classification instrument. Developed by social psychologist [[Milton Rokeach]], the instrument is designed for rank-order scaling of 36 values, including  18 terminal 18 instrumental values.&lt;ref name=Rokeach73&gt;{{cite book|last=Rokeach|first=Milton|date=1973|title=The Nature of Human Values|location=New York|publisher=The Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The task for participants in the survey is to arrange the 18 terminal values, followed by the 18 instrumental values, into an order "of importance to YOU, as guiding principles in YOUR life".&lt;ref name=Rokeach73/&gt;{{rp|27}}

The RVS has been studied in the context of [[personality psychology]], [[Behaviorism|behavior]], [[marketing]], [[social structure]] and [[cross-cultural studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Bojan|last1=Musil|first2=Velko S.|last2=Rus|first3=Janek|last3=Musek|title=The Rokeach Value Survey in comparative study of Japanese and Slovenian students: Towards the Underlying Structure|journal=Studia Psychologica|volume=51|issue=1|pages=53–68|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnston&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Charles S.|date=1995|title= The Rokeach Value Survey: Underlying structure and multidimensional scaling|journal=Journal of Psychology|volume= 129|issue=5|pages=583–597}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a number of attempts to reduce the 18 instrumental values and 18 terminal values into a set of underlying factors, but without consistent success. Attempts have included that by Feather and Peay in 1975&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feather|first1=N. T.|last2=Peay|first2=E. R.|date=1975|title=The structure of terminal and instrumental values: Dimensions and clusters|journal=Australian Journal of Psychology|volume=27|issue=2|pages=151–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Charles Johnston in 1995.&lt;ref name=Johnston/&gt;

Rokeach's RVS is based on a 1968 volume (''Beliefs, Attitudes, and Values'') which presented the philosophical basis for the association of fundamental values with [[belief]]s and [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rokeach|first=Milton|date=1968|title=Beliefs, attitudes, and values: A theory of organization and change|location=San Francisco, CA|publisher=Jossey-Bass}}&lt;/ref&gt; His value system was instrumentalised into the Rokeach Value Survey in his 1973 book ''The Nature of Human Values''.&lt;ref name=Rokeach73/&gt;

==Terminal Values==
'''Terminal Values''' refer to desirable end-states of existence. These are the goals that a person would like to achieve during his or her lifetime. These values vary among different groups of people in different cultures.

'''The terminal values in RVS are:''' 
{{colbegin}}
#True [[Friendship]]
#Mature [[Love]]
#Self-Respect
#[[Happiness]]
#Inner Harmony
#Equality
#[[Freedom]]
#[[Pleasure]]
#Social Recognition
#[[Wisdom]]
#[[Salvation]]
#Family Security
#[[National Security]]
#A Sense of Accomplishment
#A World of [[Beauty]]
#A World at [[World Peace|Peace]]
#A Comfortable Life
#An Exciting Life
{{colend}}

==Instrumental Values==
'''Instrumental Values''' refer to preferable modes of behavior. These are preferable modes of behavior, or means of achieving the terminal values.

'''The Instrumental Values are:''' 
{{colbegin}}
#Cheerfulness
#Ambition
#[[Love]]
#Cleanliness
#Self-Control
#Capability
#[[Courage]]
#Politeness
#[[Honesty]]
#[[Imagination]]
#[[Independence]]
#Intellect
#Broad-Mindedness
#[[Logic]]
#Obedience
#Helpfulness
#[[Personal responsibility|Responsibility]]
#[[Forgiveness]]
{{colend}}

==Criticisms==
Keith Gibbons and Iain Walker question whether the values included in the RVS are the ones that are critical. They argue that Rokeach, who started with several hundred values suggested by 130 individuals and a literature review, had an inadequate criteria for reducing the values. They also questioned the validity of Rockeach's measures, suggesting that when people rank the values they may not even be ranking the same referents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Keith|last1=Gibbins|first2=Iain|last2=Walker|journal=Journal of Social Psychology|date=December 1993|volume=133|issue=6|pages=797–805|title=Multiple Interpretations of the Rokeach Value Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''round-robin story''', or simply "round robin," is a type of [[collaborative fiction]] or [[storytelling]] in which a number of authors write chapters of a novel or pieces of a story, in rounds. Round-robin novels were invented in the 19th century, and later became a tradition particularly in [[science fiction]]. In modern usage, the term often applies to collaborative [[fan fiction]], particularly on the [[Internet]], though it can also refer to friends or family telling stories at a [[sleepover]], around a [[campfire]], etc.

== Malaysian/Indonesian origin ==
Amok originated from the Malaysian/Indonesian word ''meng-âmuk'', which when roughly defined means "to make a furious and desperate charge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hempel A. A., Levine R. D., Meloy J. D., Westermeyer J. D. | year = 2000 | title = Cross-cultural review of sudden mass assault by a single individual in the oriental and occidental cultures | url = | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 582–588 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Malaysian and Indonesian cultures, amok was rooted in a deep spiritual belief.&lt;ref&gt;Van Loon, F. H. G. (1927). "Amok and Latah". Retrieved March 30, 2013 from PsychINFO. [http://huie.hsu.edu:2308/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=a71ca420-96ff-40e4-be67-3ac88801c158%40sessionmgr12&amp;hid=3&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2006-01643-010]&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that amok was caused by the ''hantu belian'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pusat Rujukan Persuratan Melayu: hantu belian|url=http://prpm.dbp.gov.my/Search.aspx?k=hantu+belian|publisher=Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka|accessdate=6 November 2011|location=Malaysia|language=Malay, English|quote=hantu belian}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was an evil tiger spirit that entered one’s body and caused the heinous act. As a result of the belief, those in Indonesian culture tolerated amok and dealt with the after-effects with no ill will towards the assailant.&lt;ref name="ncbi"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Saint Martin | first = Michael | year = 1999 | title = Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | issn = 0160-6689| pmc = 181064 | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pmid = 15014687 | pages = 66–70 | doi=10.4088/pcc.v01n0302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although commonly used in a colloquial and less-violent sense, the phrase is particularly associated with a specific sociopathic [[culture-bound syndrome]] in the cultures of [[Culture of Malaysia|Malaysia]], [[Culture of Indonesia|Indonesia]] and [[Culture of Brunei|Brunei]]. In a typical case of ''running amok'', an individual (often male), having shown no previous sign of anger or any inclination to violence, will acquire a weapon (traditionally a sword or dagger, but presently any of a variety of weapons) and in a sudden frenzy, will attempt to kill or seriously injure anyone he encounters and himself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=181064|year=1999|author1=Saint Martin|first1=M. L.|title=Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome|journal=Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|volume=1|issue=3|pages=66–70|pmid=15014687|doi=10.4088/pcc.v01n0302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amok typically takes place in a well populated or crowded area. Amok episodes of this kind normally end with the attacker being killed by bystanders or committing [[suicide]], eliciting theories that amok may be a form of intentional suicide in cultures where suicide is heavily stigmatized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=23464 |title=Definition of Amok |publisher=Medterms.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who do not commit suicide and are not killed typically lose consciousness, and upon regaining consciousness, claim amnesia.

An early Western description of the practice appears in the journals of [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]], a British explorer, who encountered amok firsthand in 1770 during a voyage around the world. Cook writes of individuals behaving in a reckless, violent manner, without cause and "indiscriminately killing and maiming villagers and animals in a frenzied attack."&lt;ref&gt;(Jackson, Y. (Ed.).(2006). Encyclopedia of multicultural psychology. University of Kansas: Sage Publications)&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely accepted explanation links amok with male [[honor]] (amok by women and children is virtually unknown).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alexanra Ringe|first=Carrie McLaren|title=Curious Mental Illnesses Around the World|url=http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/archives/21/mental_illness.html|publisher=stayfreemagazone.org|accessdate=March 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218053501/http://www.stayfreemagazine.org/archives/21/mental_illness.html#|archive-date=2012-12-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Running amok would thus be both a way of escaping the world (since perpetrators were normally killed or committed suicide) and re-establishing one's reputation as a man to be feared and respected.

== Contemporary syndrome ==
"Running amok" is used to refer to the behavior of someone who, in the grip of strong emotion, obtains a weapon and begins attacking people indiscriminately, often with multiple fatalities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; An episode of amok may be triggered by a period of depression or highly aggressive behavior. The slang terms ''[[going postal]]'' or ''going ballistic'' are similar in scope.
Police describe such an event as a [[spree killer|killing spree]]. If the individual is seeking death an alternate method is often "[[suicide by cop]]".

Amok is often described as a culture-bound (or culture-specific) syndrome,&lt;ref name="pmid15014687"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Saint Martin ML |title=Running Amok: A Modern Perspective on a Culture-Bound Syndrome |journal=Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=66–70 |date=June 1999 |pmid=15014687 |pmc=181064 |doi= 10.4088/pcc.v01n0302|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1427677"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gaw AC, Bernstein RL |title=Classification of amok in DSM-IV |journal=Hosp Community Psychiatry |volume=43 |issue=8 |pages=789–93 |date=August 1992 |pmid=1427677 |doi= |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1427677 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a psychological condition whose manifestation is strongly shaped by cultural factors. Other reported culture-bound syndromes are [[latah]] and [[Penis panic|koro]]. Amok is also sometimes considered one of the subcategories of [[dissociative disorders]] (cross-cultural variant).

== Officially classified as a psychiatric condition ==
In 1849, amok was officially classified as a psychiatric condition based on numerous reports and case studies that showed the majority of individuals who committed amok were, in some sense, mentally ill.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt; The modern [[DSM-IV]] method of [[classification of mental disorders]] contains two official types of amok disorder; beramok and amok. Beramok is considered to be the more common of the two and is associated with the depression and sadness resulting from a loss and the subsequent brooding process. Loss includes, but is not limited to, the death of a spouse or loved one, divorce, loss of a job, money, power, etc. Beramok is associated with mental issues of severe depression or other mood disorders. Amok, the rarer form, is believed to stem from rage, insult, or a vendetta against a person, society, or object for a wide variety of reasons. Amok has been more closely associated with psychosis, personality disorders, bipolar disorder, and delusions.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;

== Historical and cross-cultural comparisons ==
Early travelers in Asia sometimes describe a kind of military amok, in which soldiers apparently facing inevitable defeat suddenly burst into a frenzy of violence which so startled their enemies that it either delivered victory or at least ensured what the soldier in that culture considered an honourable death.

An example would be during the [[Battle of Bukit Chandu]] in Singapore during WWII when 41 outnumbered soldiers of the Malay Regiment, led by [[Adnan Saidi]], charged and went all out against a 13 000 strong invading Japanese Army. They continued the fight armed with just knives and bayonets for three days before they were finally defeated.

This form of amok appears to resemble the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] ''[[Berserker]]'', the ''cafard'' or ''cathard'' (Polynesia), ''mal de pelea'' (Puerto Rico), and ''iich'aa'' (Navaho).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/ant100/pdf/MedicalAnthropology.pdf |title=Medical Anthropology: Culture-bound syndromes |accessdate=2009-04-29 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary [[Indonesia]], the term ''amok'' (''amuk'') generally refers not to individual violence, but to frenzied violence by mobs. Indonesians now commonly use the term 'gelap mata' (literally 'darkened eyes') to refer to individual amok. [[Laurens van der Post]] experienced the phenomenon in the East Indies and wrote in 1955:

{{quote|'Gelap mata', the Dark Eye, is an expression used in Sumatra and Java to describe a curious and disturbing social phenomenon. Socially speaking, the Malays, Sumatrans and Javanese are the best behaved people I have ever encountered. On the surface they are an extremely gentle, refined, submissive people. In fact the word 'Malay' comes from 'malu', 'gentle', and gentleness is a quality prized above all others among the Malays and their neighbours. In their family life, in their submission to traditional and parental authority, in their communal duties, they are among the most obedient people on earth. But every now and then something very disturbing happens. A man who has behaved in this obliging manner all his life and who has always done his duty by the outside world to perfection, suddenly finds it impossible to keep doing so. Overnight he revolts against goodness and dutifulness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Laurens van der Post|van der Post, Laurens]], ''The Dark Eye in Africa'' (London, 1955), p.51-52&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the [[Philippines]], ''amok'' also means unreasoning murderous rage by an individual. In 1876, the Spanish governor-general of the Philippines [[José Malcampo]] coined the term ''[[juramentado]]'' for the behavior (from ''juramentar'' - "to take an oath"), surviving into modern [[Philippine languages]] as ''huramentado''.&lt;ref name=Hurley14&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hurley |first1=Vic |title=Swish of the Kris; The Story of the Moros |url=http://www.nikhef.nl/~tonvr/keris/keris2/swish/index.html |accessdate=April 17, 2011 |edition= |series= |volume= |issue= |date= |year=1936 |month= |origyear= |publisher=E.P.

Norse [[Berserker]]s and the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] battle trance are two other examples of the tendency of certain groups to work themselves up into a killing frenzy.

According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]], some notable cases have occurred among the [[Rajputs]]. In 1634, the eldest son of the [[raja]] of [[Jodhpur]] ran amok at the court of [[Shah Jahan]], failing in his attack on the emperor, but killing five of his officials. During the 18th century, again, at [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] (Sind), two envoys, sent by the Jodhpur chief in regard to a quarrel between the two states, stabbed the prince and twenty-six of his suite before they themselves fell.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amuck, Running|volume=1|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Theravada]] tradition, [[Dukkha|suffering]] arises when one identifies with or [[upadana|clings]] to the aggregates. This suffering is [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|extinguished]] by relinquishing attachments to aggregates. The [[Mahayana]] tradition asserts that the nature of all aggregates is intrinsically [[Shunyata|empty]] of [[Svabhava|independent existence]].

==Etymology and meaning==
''Skandha'' (स्कन्ध) is a Sanskrit word that means "multitude, quantity, aggregate", generally in the context of body, trunk, stem, empirically observed gross object or anything of bulk verifiable with senses.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p232"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mmwp1141&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ|year=1872|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=1141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term appears in the Vedic literature. The Pali equivalent word ''Khandha'' (sometimes spelled ''Kkhanda'')&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p55"/&gt; appears extensively in the Pali canon, where state [[Thomas Rhys Davids|Rhys Davids]] and William Stede, it means "bulk of the body, aggregate, heap, material collected into bulk" in one context, "all that is comprised under, groupings" in some contexts, and particularly as "the elements or substrata of sensory existence, sensorial aggregates which condition the appearance of life in any form".&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p232"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids |author2=William Stede |title=Pali-English Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC |year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1144-7 |pages=232–234 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu|Thanissaro]], the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] never defined a "person" in terms of the aggregates (Pali: ''khandha''), but "such a notion is expressed by some modern scholars as if it were pan-Buddhist".&lt;ref name=thanissaro309/&gt; He adds that almost any Buddhist meditation teacher explains it that way, as even Buddhist commentaries from about 1st century CE onwards have done. In Thanissaro's view, this is incorrect, and he suggests that ''skandha'' should be viewed as "functions or aspects" of a sentient being.&lt;ref name=thanissaro309&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, ''Handful of Leaves Volume 2'', 2nd edition 2006, page 309.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dalai Lama, ''skandha'' means "heap, group, collection or aggregate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dalai Lama|title=The Opening of the Wisdom-Eye: And the History of the Advancement of Buddhadharma in Tibet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZnHOkMbp6wYC&amp;pg=PA37|year=1966|publisher=Theosophical Publishing House|isbn=978-0-8356-0549-6|pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adrian Snodgrass]] asserts that the term literally means "heap", and the concept refers to the teaching accepted by all Buddhist schools that "the personality is an aggregate of five constituent parts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrian Snodgrass |title=The Symbolism of the Stupa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nzqK8dDCM0UC |year=1992|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0781-5 |pages=137 with note 165 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Williams et al. translate ''skandha'' as "heap, aggregate", stating it refers to the explanation of the psychophysical makeup of any being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Williams |author2=Anthony Tribe |title=Buddhist Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BVvFBQAAQBAJ  |year=2000|publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415207002|pages=42, 48, 58–60, 69–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Damien Keown and Charles Prebish state ''skandha'' is ''phung po'' in Tibetan, and the terms mean "collections or aggregates or bundles", and in the context of canonical Buddhism the concept asserts that "the notion of a self is unnecessarily superimposed upon five skandha" of a phenomenon or a living being.&lt;ref name="KeownPrebish2013p844"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Damien Keown |author2=Charles S.

[[Johannes Bronkhorst]] renders ''skandha'' as "aggregates", stating that the meaning and importance of the concept is in explaining the non-self concept in Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2013p28"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Bronkhorst |title=Buddhist Teaching in India| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fjU6AwAAQBAJ |year=2009 |publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn=978-0-86171-811-5| pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist texts assert the five aggregates are what there is to a person and personality, and in each ''skandha'' – body, sensations, perceptions, mental formations and consciousness – there is emptiness and no substance.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p55"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2013p28"/&gt;

==Description: the five skandhas==
The Buddha teaches in the [[Tripiṭaka|Pali Canon]] the five aggregates as follows:
#'''[[rūpa|"form"]]''' or ''"matter"''{{refn|group=lower-alpha|In Rawson (1991:  p.11), the first skandha is defined as:  "name and form (Sanskrit ''nāma-rūpa'', Tibetan ''gzugs'')...".  In the [[Pali literature]], ''[[Namarupa|nāma-rūpa]]'' traditionally refers to the first four aggregates, as opposed to the fifth aggregate, consciousness.}} (Skt., Pāli ''रूप rūpa''; Tib. ''gzugs''): matter, body or "material form" of a being or any existence.&lt;ref name=stevenemmanuel587/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p56"/&gt; Buddhist texts state ''rupa'' of any person, sentient being and object to be composed of four basic elements or forces: earth (solidity), water (cohesion), fire (heat) and wind (motion).&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p55"/&gt;
#'''[[vedanā|"sensation"]]''' or ''"feeling"'' (Skt., Pāli ''वेदना vedanā''; Tib. ''tshor-ba''): sensory experience of an object.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p56"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey |title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices, 2nd Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC |year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages =56–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is either pleasant, unpleasant or neutral.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The Pali canon universally identifies that ''vedana'' involves the sensing or feeling of something as pleasant, unpleasant or neutral (see, for instance, SN 22).  When contemporary authors elaborate on ''vedana'', they define it similarly (see, for instance, [[Nhat Hanh]], 1999, p. 178; Trungpa, 2001, p. 21; and, Trungpa, 2002, p. 126).  The one exception is in Trungpa (1976), pp. 20-23, where he states that the "strategies or impluses" of "indifference, passion and aggression" are "part of the third stage [aggregate]," "guided by perception."  (This section of Trungpa, 1976, is anthologized in Trungpa, 1999, pp. 55-58.)}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Generally, ''vedanā'' is considered to ''not'' include "emotions." For example, Bodhi (2000a), p. 80, writes: "The Pali word ''vedanā'' does not signify emotion (which appears to be a complex phenomenon involving a variety of concomitant mental factors), but the bare affective quality of an experience, which may be either pleasant, painful or neutral."  Perhaps somewhat similarly, Trungpa (1999), p.58, writes: "Consciousness [the fifth aggregate] consists of emotions and irregular thought patterns...."}}
#'''[[saññā|"perception"]]''' (Skt. ''संज्ञा saṃjñā'', Pāli ''सञ्ञा saññā'', Tib. '' 'du-shes''): sensory and mental process that registers, recognizes and labels (for instance, the shape of a tree, color green, emotion of fear).&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p56"/&gt;
#'''[[Saṅkhāra|"mental formations"]]''' (Skt. ''संस्कार saṃskāra'', Pāli ''सङ्खार {{IAST|saṅkhāra}}'', Tib. '' 'du-byed''): '"constructing activities"'',''&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p56" /&gt; "conditioned things"'',  ''"volition"'', ''"karmic activities"; all types of mental imprints and conditioning triggered by an object.&lt;ref name="Kalupahana1992p71"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J.

#'''[[viññāṇa|"consciousness"]]''' (Skt. ''विज्ञान vijñāna'', Pāli ''विञ्ञाण {{IAST|viññāṇa}}'', Tib.

While all the aggregates are conditioned phenomena marked by the [[three characteristics]], consciousness serves as the connecting thread of [[personal continuity]] through the sequence of rebirths.... The other four aggregates serve as the 'stations for consciousness' (''vinnanatthitiyo'': see [SN] 22:53-54).  Even consciousness, however, is not a self-identical entity but a sequence of dependently arisen occasions of cognizing; see MN I 256-60."}} that which discerns.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''The Selfless Mind.''

While colours usually be immediately identified, tastes and feelings often need careful consideration to properly identify them: discernment and analysis are needed."}}

For instance, Nhat Hanh (1999, pp. 180-1) states: "Consciousness here means [[store consciousness]], which is at the base of everything we are, the ground of all of our mental formations."  Similarly, Trungpa (2001, pp. 73-4) states that consciousness "is the finally developed state of being that contains all the previous elements....  [C]onsciousness constitutes an immediately available source of occupation for the momentum of the skandhas to feed on."}}

The initial part of the Buddhist practice is purification of each of the above "five aggregates" through meditation, study, ritual and living by virtues, particularly abstaining from mental intoxicants. Ultimately, the practice shifts to considering these as naive, then transcending them to reach the state of realization that there is neither person nor self within, or in any other being, states Harvey, where everyone and everything is without self or substantiality and is a "cluster of changing physical and mental processes".&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2013p28"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey |title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices, 2nd Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC |year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|page =57 }}&lt;/ref&gt; David Kalupahana clarifies that the individual is considered unreal but the ''skandha'' are considered real in some early Buddhist texts, but the ''skandha'' too are considered unreal and nonsubstantial in numerous other Buddhist Nikaya and Āgama texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David J.

==Application==
===Understanding Four Noble Truths===
[[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] (2000b, p.&amp;nbsp;840) states that the aggregates are linked to ''[[dukkha]]'' (suffering) in the Buddha's [[Four Noble Truths]] teaching in the following way:
#Understanding suffering: the five aggregates are the "ultimate referent" in the Buddha's elaboration on dukkha in his First Noble Truth: "Since all four truths revolve around suffering, understanding the aggregates is essential for understanding the Four Noble Truths as a whole."
#Clinging causes future suffering: the five aggregates are the substrata for clinging and thus "contribute to the causal origination of future suffering".
#Release from samsara: clinging to the five aggregates must be removed in order to achieve release from [[samsara]].

====Understanding dukkha====
In the [[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]] the Buddha provides the classic elaboration on the first of his Four Noble Truths, "The Truth of Suffering" (Dukkhasacca):
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
Now this, monks, for the spiritually ennobled, is the painful (''dukkha'') true reality (''ariyasacca''):
[i] birth is painful, aging is painful, illness is painful, death is painful;
[ii] sorrow, lamentation, physical pain, unhappiness and distress are painful;
[iii] union with what is disliked is painful, separation from what is liked is painful, not to get what one wants is painful;
[iv] in brief, the five bundles of grasping-fuel (''upadana-skandha'') are painful.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|''Samyutta Nikaya, 5.421''|Translated by Peter Harvey&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p55"/&gt;}}

The fourth category of ''Dukkha'' consisting of "five bundles of grasping fuel", states Harvey, are the "five aggregates" that form a person.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p55"/&gt; Each aggregate is an object of grasping (clinging), at the root of self-identification as "I, me, myself".&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p55"/&gt; All five are phenomenon that formulate a sense of personality, and they trigger suffering, pain or unsatisfactoriness. Everything that makes a person is a factor of ''dukkha'', and these in Buddhist thought are not a source of pleasure but of sorrow.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p56"/&gt; Nirvana requires transcendence from all five ''skandhas'' and the sense objects.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p56"/&gt;

====Three marks of the skandhas====
The Buddhist scriptures assert that all five skhandhas have three characteristics often called ''ti-lakkhana'' (''tri-lakshana'', three marks). These are ''Dukkha'', ''[[Anicca]]'' (impermanence) and ''[[Anatta]]'' (non-Self).&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p55"/&gt;

Each of the ''skandhas'' come into being and dissolve ([[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|Samsara]]).&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p55"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/anicca Anicca Buddhism], Encyclopædia Britannica (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; This is applicable to all beings and their environs, including human beings as well as beings who have [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] in [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]] ([[deity|god]]) and [[naraka]] (hell) realms.&lt;ref name=damienkeown32&gt;{{cite book|author=Damien Keown |title=Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QXX0Uq29aoC |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-966383-5 |pages=32–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvey2012p46"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=32–33, 38–39, 46–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, states Buddhism, each of the ''skandhas'', a person and every being lacks a self and substantiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=David J. Kalupahana| title=Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOYGAAAAYAAJ |year=1975 |publisher=University Press of Hawaii |isbn=978-0-8248-0298-1 | pages=84–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the "non-self" (''anatta'') doctrine, and it holds that a belief in self is a source of ''Dukkha'' (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Peter Harvey| title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC|year=2012| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-0-521-85942-4| pages=57–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Peter Harvey| editor=Steven M.

Realizing the real nature of ''skandhas'', both in terms of impermanence and non-self, is necessary for nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=59–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===No essence===
{{main article|Sunyata}}

The Buddha taught that aggregates are appearances which don't have an essence either separately or together, all that is perceived as an aggregate or a whole has no real existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clark Johnson |title=On Buddha Essence: A Commentary on Rangjung Dorje's Treatise |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=azieVNVB6aYC&amp;pg=PA34 |year=2006|publisher=Shambhala Publications |isbn=978-1-59030-276-7 |pages=34–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SideritsThompson2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Siderits |author2=Evan Thompson |author3=Dan Zahavi |title=Self, No Self?: Perspectives from Analytical, Phenomenological, and Indian Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHZoAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press  |isbn=978-0-19-166830-2 |pages=242–247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explicit denial of substantiality or essence in any of the five ''skandha'' appears in the early Buddhist texts:

{{quote|All form is comparable to foam; all feelings to bubbles; all sensations are mirage-like; dispositions are like the plantain trunk; consciousness is but an illusion: so did the Buddha illustrate [the nature of the aggregates].&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana (1975), page 86. The quote is from S 3.142, and also occurs in the Āgamas.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''skandha'' doctrine, state Mark Siderits et al., is a form of anti-realism about everyday reality including persons, and presents an alternative to "substantialist views of the self".&lt;ref name="SideritsThompson2013"/&gt; It is a Buddhist reductionism of everything perceived, each person and personality as an "aggregate, heap" of composite entities without essence.&lt;ref name="SideritsThompson2013"/&gt; This 'no essence' view has been a source of sustained questions, major disagreements and commentaries since ancient times, by non-Buddhist Indian religions, as well as within Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Siderits |author2=Evan Thompson |author3=Dan Zahavi |title=Self, No Self?: Perspectives from Analytical, Phenomenological, and Indian Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHZoAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press  |isbn=978-0-19-166830-2 |pages=247–251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Edelglass |author2=Jay Garfield  |title=Buddhist Philosophy: Essential Readings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tEb63CGvShsC |year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-971655-5 |pages=261–264, 288–295, 297–308, 358–363, 226–227, 317–329 }};&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|author1=Irina Kuznetsova|author2=Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad|author3=Jonardon Ganeri|title=Hindu and Buddhist Ideas in Dialogue: Self and No-Self|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MP0I5KNFFl8C|year=2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-1-4094-5662-9|chapter=Chapter 9, see also the Introduction Chapter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rupert Gethin|title=The Foundations of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FUwSDAAAQBAJ|date=16 July 1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-289223-2|pages=140–149, 238–239}}, '''Quote:''' We have seen how Buddhist thought criticizes the concept of an unchanging self as incoherent; however, both ancient and modern critics have argued that to do away with the self in the manner of Buddhist thought in fact creates insurmountable philosophical and moral problems. (...) We have seen how Buddhist thought breaks down an individual into five classes of physical and mental events known as ''skandhas'' or aggregates".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arahants===
{{main article|Arhat (Buddhism)|Tathagata}}

Another application of the ''skandha'' theory in Buddhist texts is in descriptions of the enlightened, perfected state of ''Arhat'' and ''Tathagata''.&lt;ref name=peterharvey1995p229/&gt; The perfect state of enlightenment is one without any personality, no "I am" conceit, no physical identification, no intellectual identification, no identification in direct or indirects terms related to any of the five ''skandhas'', translates Peter Harvey, because "a tathagata has abandoned the personality factors".&lt;ref name=peterharvey1995p229/&gt; The physical, the personality factors (''skandhas''), and any sense of Self or I are a burden which the enlightened individual has dropped, thus becoming a "man of nothing", not clinging to anything internal or external.&lt;ref name=peterharvey1995p229&gt;Peter Harvey (1995), ''The Selfless Mind'', Curzon Press, pages 228-230.&lt;/ref&gt; No one can find him because he has no "I", self or identity, while his ''[[citta]]'' expands to infinity; he is beyond the reach of the unenlightened human beings, as well as the army of the ''Mara'' (demon of death in Buddhism).&lt;ref name=peterharvey1995p229/&gt;

==Understanding in Theravada Abhidhamma==
{{PancaKhandha}}
While [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism|early Buddhism]] reflects the teachings as found in the Pali Sutta Pitaka and the Chinese Āgama, the [[Early Buddhist schools]] developed detailed analyses and overviews of the teachings found in those sutras, called [[Abhidharma]]. Each school developed its own Abhidharma, the best known is the Theravāda Abhidhamma. The [[Abhidharma#Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma|Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma]] has been preserved partly in the Chinese Āgama.

===Six sense bases===
{{main article|Ayatana|Ṣaḍāyatana}}

The Theravada tradition teaches the "six sense bases" theory, understood as six pairs of internal and external sense bases that accommodate "all the factors of existence", it is "the all", and "apart from which nothing at all exists", states [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]].{{sfn|Bodhi|2000b|p=1122}} These six sense bases in the Theravada exegesis are an alternative to the five ''skandhas'', but they are corollaries of the ''skandha'' doctrine and not an innovation.{{sfn|Bodhi|2000b|pp=1121-1123}} In this teaching, found in texts such as ''Salayatana samyutta'', the coming together of an object and a sense-organ results in the arising of the corresponding consciousness. The suttas themselves don't describe this alternative. It is in the Abhidhamma, striving to "a single all-inclusive system"{{sfn|Bodhi|2000b|p=1123}} that the five aggregates and the six sense bases are explicitly connected.{{sfn|Bodhi|2000b|p=1123}}

The ''Maha-punnama Sutta'', also called ''The Great Full-moon Night Discourse'', describes the impermanence of the aggregates to assert that there is no self, and the right discernment is, "this is not mine, this is not my self, this is not what I am".{{Refn|group=lower-alpha|From '''Maha-punnama Sutta'''
&lt;poem&gt;
[Buddha:] "It's possible that a senseless person — immersed in ignorance, overcome with craving — might think that he could outsmart the Teacher's message in this way: 'So — form is not-self, feeling is not-self, perception is not-self, fabrications are not-self, consciousness is not-self. Then what self will be touched by the actions done by what is not-self?' Now, monks, haven't I trained you in counter-questioning with regard to this &amp; that topic here &amp; there? What do you think — Is form constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord." "And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?" "Stressful, lord." "And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as: 'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?"
[Monks:] "No, lord."
"... Is feeling constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."...
"... Is perception constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."...
"... Are fabrications constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."...
"What do you think, monks — Is consciousness constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord." "And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?" "Stressful, lord." "And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as: 'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?"
"No, lord."
"Thus, monks, any form whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as: 'This is not mine. This is not my self. This is not what I am.'
&lt;/poem&gt;
– Majjhima Nikaya iii 15, Translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.109.than.html Maha-punnama Sutta: The Great Full-moon Night Discourse], Thanissaro Bhikkhu (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;}} This theme is retained in the Theravadin six sense bases exegesis, states Bhikkhu Bodhi, which sum up the conditioned existence as "the all" of the sense bases, and that the "six bases are empty of a self and of what belongs to the self".{{sfn|Bodhi|2000b|pp=1125-127}}

===Twelve sense bases===
An alternate formulation of the aggregates is in the terms of Twelve Sense Bases:{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}
* The first five ''external'' sense bases (visible form, sound, smell, taste and touch) are part of the '''form''' aggregate.
* The mental sense-object (i.e. mental objects) overlap the first four aggregates ('''form''', '''feeling''', '''perception''' and '''formation''').
* The first five ''internal'' sense bases (eye, ear, nose, tongue and body) are also part of the '''form''' aggregate.
* The mental sense organ (mind) is comparable to the aggregate of '''consciousness'''.

Bodhi states the six sense bases is a "vertical" view of human experiences while the aggregates is a "horizontal" (temporal) view.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi, 2000b, pp. 1122-23&lt;/ref&gt; The Theravada Buddhist meditation practice on sense bases is aimed at both removing distorted cognitions such as those influenced by cravings, conceits and opinions, as well as "uprooting all conceivings in all its guises".&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), pp. 1125-26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eighteen Dhātus===
&lt;!--"Maudgalyayana#Meeting the Buddha" links here.--&gt;
The eighteen dhātus{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The Pāli word ''dhātu'' is used in multiple contexts in the Pāli canon: For instance, Bodhi (2000b), pp. 527-8, identifies four different ways that ''dhātu'' is used including in terms of the "eighteen elements" and in terms of "the four primary elements" (''[[mahabhuta|catudhātu]]'').}} – Six External Bases, Six Internal Bases, and Six Consciousnesses – function through the five aggregates. These dhātus can be arranged into six triads, each triad composed of a sense object, a sense organ, and sense consciousness.  In regards to the aggregates:&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000a), pp. 287-8.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first five sense organs (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body) are derivates of '''form'''.
** The sixth sense organ (mind) is part of '''consciousness'''.
* The first five sense objects (visible forms, sound, smell, taste, touch) are also derivatives of '''form'''.
** The sixth sense object (mental object) includes '''form''', '''feeling''', '''perception''' and '''mental formations'''.
* The six sense consciousnesses are the basis for '''consciousness'''.

===Four Paramatthas===
The Abhidhamma and post-canonical Pali texts create a meta-scheme for the [[Sutta Pitaka]]'s conceptions of aggregates, sense bases and dhattus (elements).&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000a), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This meta-scheme is known as the four ''paramatthas'' or ultimate realities.

====Ultimate realities====
There are four paramatthas; three conditioned, one unconditioned:
* Material phenomena (rūpa, form)
* Mind or Consciousness (Citta)
* Mental factors (Cetasikas: the nama-factors sensation, perception and formation)
* [[Nirvana|Nibbāna]]

====Mapping of the paramatthas====
The mapping between the aggregates, the twelve sense bases, and the ultimate realities is represented in this chart:{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Chart is based on Bodhi (2000a), p. 288.}}

===Twelve Nidanas===
{{see also|Dependent Origination}}
The [[Twelve Nidanas]] describe twelve phenomenal links by which suffering is perpetuated between and within lives.

====Inclusion of the five aggregates====
Embedded within this model, four of the five aggregates are explicitly mentioned in the following sequence:
* mental formations (''saṅkhāra • saṃskāra'') condition consciousness (''{{IAST|viññāṇa • vijñāna}}'')
* which conditions name-and-form (''nāma-rūpa'')
* which conditions the precursors (''{{IAST|saḷāyatana}}'', ''phassa  • sparśa'') to sensations (''vedanā'')
* which in turn condition craving (''{{IAST|taṇhā • tṛṣṇā}}'') and clinging (''upādāna'')
* which ultimately lead to the "entire mass of suffering" (''kevalassa dukkhakkhandha'').{{refn|group=lower-alpha|&gt;Put another way, it is through the five skandhas that clinging occurs.  See, for instance, the Samadhi Sutta (SN 22:5) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.005.than.html (Thanissaro, 2006b).]}}

The interplay between the five-aggregate model of immediate causation and the twelve-nidana model of requisite conditioning is evident, for instance underlining the seminal role that mental formations have in both the origination and cessation of suffering.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The apparent distinctions between the nidana model and the khandha model are reduced when, instead of using the twelve-nidana model of the Samyutta Nikaya, chapter 12 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.002.than.html (e.g., Thanissaro, 1997d)], one compares the nine-nidana model of the ''Maha-nidana Sutta'' ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 15) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.15.0.than.html (Thanissaro, 1997a)] where consciousness conditions name-and-form and name-and-form conditions consciousness.}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Bodhi (2000b, pp. 839-840) writes: "Whereas the teaching on dependent origination is intended to disclose the dynamic pattern running through everyday experience that propels the round of rebirth and death forward from life to life, the teaching on the five aggregates concentrates on experience in its lived immediacy in the continuum from birth to death."  Perhaps in a similar vein, Bodhi (2000b, pp. 762-3, n. 132) notes elsewhere that, according to the Samyutta Nikaya's subcommentary: "There are two kinds of ''origin,'' momentary origin (''khanika-samudaya'') and origin through conditions (''paccaya-samudaya'').  A bhikkhu who sees one sees the other."}}

====Three lives====
According to Hans Wolfgang Schumann, the nidānas are a later synthesis of Buddhist teachings meant to make them more comprehensible. Comparison with the five skandhas shows that the chain contains logical inconsistencies, which can be explained when the chain is considered to be a later elaboration.{{sfn|Schumann|1974}} This way it is explainable that nāma-rūpa in consciousness in the nine-fold are the beginning or start, while in the twelve-fold chain they are preceded by ignorance and formations. Those can only exist when ''nāma-rūpa'' in consciousness are present.
Schumann also proposes that the twelve-fold is extended over three existences, and illustrates the succession of rebirths. While Buddhaghosa in Vasubandhu maintains a 2-8-2 schema, Schumann maintains a 3-6-3 scheme, putting the five skandhas alongside the twelve nidānas.{{sfn|Schumann|1974}}

==Understanding in the Mahayana-tradition==
The Mahayana developed out of the traditional schools, introducing new texts and putting other emphases in the teachings, especially sunyata and the [[Bodhisattva|Bodhisattva-ideal]].

===India===
====Prajnaparamita====
The Prajnaparamita-teachings developed from the first century BCE onward. It emphasises the "emptiness" of everything that exists. This means that there are no eternally existing "essences", since everything is [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependently originated]]. The skandhas too are dependently originated, and lack any substantial existence .{{refn|group=lower-alpha|While Red Pine (2004) contextualizes the Prajnaparamita texts as a historical ''reaction'' to some early Buddhist Abhidhammas, some interpretations of the Theravada Abhidhamma are ''consistent'' with the prajnaparamita notion of "emptiness."}}

This is famously stated in the [[Heart Sutra]]. The Sanskrit version{{refn|group=lower-alpha|According to Nattier (1992), the Heart Sutra was originally composed in Chinese and later back-translated into Sanskrit. Thereafter, it became popular in India and later Tibet. As indicated in an endnote further below, elements in this translation are not present in Chinese versions of this sutra.}} of the classic "Prajnaparamita Hridaya Sutra" ("Heart Sutra") states:
{{quote|The noble [[Avalokiteshvara]] [[Bodhisattva]],&lt;br&gt;

Nhat Hanh (1988) adds to this first verse the sentence: "After this penetration, he overcame all pain."  Suzuki (1960), p. 29, notes that this additional sentence is unique to Hsuan-chuang's translation and is omitted in other versions of the Heart Sutra.}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|In the Theravada canon, the English word "self-existence" is a translation of the Sanskrit word svabhava. Regarding the term ''sabhāva'' (Pali; Skt: ''svabhāva'') in the Pali Canon, Gal (2003), p. 7, writes: "To judge from the ''suttas'', the term ''sabhāva'' was never employed by the Buddha and it is rare in the Pali Canon in general. Only in the post-canonical period does it become a standard concept, when it is extensively used in the commentarial descriptions of the ''dhammas'' [conditioned mental and physical processes] and in the sub-commentarial exegesis.
The term ''sabhāva'', though, does occur on various occasions in five canonical or para-canonical texts: the ''[[Patisambhidamagga|Pa{{IAST|ṭ}}isambhidāmagga]]'', the ''[[Petakopadesa|Pe{{IAST|ṭ}}akopadesa]]'', the ''[[Nettipakarana|Nettippakara{{IAST|ṇ}}a]]'', the ''[[Milindapanha|Milindapañha]]'' and the ''[[Buddhavamsa|Buddhava{{IAST|ṃ}}sa]]''."
Gal (p. 10) speculates that the use of the term ''sabhāva'' in the ''Pa{{IAST|ṭ}}isambhidāmagga'' might be the earliest occurrence in Pali literature and quotes (p. 7, esply. ''n''. 28) from this text (Pa{{IAST|ṭ}}is.

====Madhyamaka====
{{main article|Madhyamaka}}

The Madhyaka-school elaborates on the notion of [[Middle way|the middle way]]. Its basic text is the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]], written by [[Nagarjuna]], who refuted the [[Sarvastivada]] conception of reality, which reifies dhammas.&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana 1975, page 78&lt;/ref&gt; The simultaneous non-reification of the self and reification of the skandhas has been viewed by some Buddhist thinkers as highly problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Jinpa 2002 , page 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yogacara====
{{main article|Yogacara}}
The Yogacara-school further analysed the workings of the mind, elaborated on the concept of nama-rupa and the five skandhas, and developed the notion of the [[Eight Consciousnesses]].

===China===
Sunyata, in Chinese texts, is [[Mu (negative)|"wu"]], ''nothingness''.{{sfn|Lai|2003}}{{sfn|Swanson|1993|p=373}} In these texts, the relation between absolute and relative was a central topic in understanding the Buddhist teachings. The aggregates convey the [[Samvriti|relative]] (or conventional) experience of the world by an individual, although [[Paramartha|Absolute]] truth is realized through them.

Commenting on the Heart Sutra, [[Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki|D.T. Suzuki]] notes:
{{quote|When the sutra says that the five Skandhas have the character of emptiness [...], the sense is: no limiting qualities are to be attributed to the Absolute; while it is immanent in all concrete and particular objects, it is not in itself definable.&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki (1960), p. 29, ''n''. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Tathagatagarbha====
{{main article|Tathagatagarbha}}

The Tathāgatagarbha Sutras, which developed in India, played a prominent role in China. The tathagatagarbha-sutras, on occasion, speak of the ineffable skandhas of the Buddha (beyond the nature of worldly skandhas and beyond worldly understanding). In the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]] the Buddha tells of how the Buddha's skandhas are in fact eternal and unchanging. The Buddha's skandhas are said to be incomprehensible to unawakened vision.

===Tibet===
The [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana tradition]] further develops the aggregates in terms of [[mahamudra]] epistemology and tantric reifications.

====Insubstantiality====
Referring to mahamudra teachings, [[Chogyam Trungpa]] &lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;10–12; and, Trungpa, 2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;124, 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; identifies the form aggregate as the "solidification" of [[avijja|ignorance]] (Pali, ''avijja''; Skt., ''avidya''), allowing one to have the illusion of "possessing" ever dynamic and spacious [[vidya|wisdom]] (Pali, ''vijja''; Skt. ''vidya''), and thus being the basis for the creation of a [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualistic]] relationship between "self" and "other."{{refn|group=lower-alpha|This type of analysis of the aggregates (where ignorance conditions the five aggregates) might be akin to that described by the [[Twelve Nidanas]].}}

According to [[Trungpa tülkus|Trungpa Rinpoche]],&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa Rinpoche 1976, pp.&amp;nbsp;20–22&lt;/ref&gt; the five skandhas are "a set of Buddhist concepts which describe experience as a five-step process" and that "the whole development of the five skandhas...is an attempt on our part to shield ourselves from the truth of our insubstantiality," while "the practice of meditation is to see the transparency of this shield." &lt;ref&gt;Trungpa Rinpoche 1976, p.&amp;nbsp;23&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deity yoga====
Trungpa Rinpoche writes (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;38):
{{quote|[S]ome of the details of tantric iconography are developed from abhidharma [that is, in this context, detailed analysis of the aggregates].  Different colors and feelings of this particular consciousness, that particular emotion, are manifested in a particular deity wearing such-and-such a costume, of certain particular colors, holding certain particular sceptres in his hand.  Those details are very closely connected with the individualities of particular psychological processes.}}

==Relation to other Indian religions==
The use of the ''skandhas'' concept to explain the self is unique to Buddhism among major Indian religions. It contrasts with the premise of [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]] that a living being has an eternal soul or metaphysical self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Ruhe|title=Freeing the Buddha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9mz9yg74wAC |year=2005|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1835-4|pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Loy |title=Awareness Bound and Unbound: Buddhist Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5KHnVVjwKQC |year=2009|publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-1-4384-2680-8|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miri Albahari objects to the usual understanding of the skandhas as denoting the absence of any "self." Albahari has argued that the ''khandhas'' do not necessarily constitute the entirety of the human experience, and that the Hindu concept of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]] (eternal soul) is not explicitly negated by Pāli Canon.&lt;ref name="Albani2000"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Albahari|first=Miri|date=2002-03|title=Against No-Ātman Theories of Anattā|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F09552360220142225|journal=Asian Philosophy|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=5–20|doi=10.1080/09552360220142225|issn=0955-2367|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Albani, "anattā is best understood as a practical strategy rather than as a metaphysical doctrine."&lt;ref name="Albani2000"/&gt; To Albahari, [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|''Nibbāna'']] is an ever-present part of human nature, which is gradually "uncovered" by the cessation of ignorance.

'''Tirhuta'''  or '''Mithilakshar''' is the [[writing system|script]] used for the [[Maithili language]] originating in the [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] region of [[Bihar]], [[India]] and the eastern [[Terai]] region of [[Nepal]]. The oldest reference to Tirhuta script is Sahodara Temple of [[Narkatiaganj|Narkatiyaganj]], Bihar, dated 950 CE &lt;ref name="n4035"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2011/11175r-tirhuta.pdf | title=N4035: Proposal to Encode the Tirhuta Script in ISO/IEC 10646 | first1=Anshuman | last1=Pandey | publisher=Working Group Document, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2 | date=2011-05-05 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213054204/http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2011/11175r-tirhuta.pdf | archivedate=13 December 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The script has a rich history spanning a thousand years, believed to be originated in the 10th century CE, but years of neglect by [[Nepal]] and the [[Bihar]] government have taken their toll on the use of Tirhuta. It is similar to [[Bengali script]]. Most speakers of Maithili have switched to using the [[Devanagari script]], which is also used to write neighboring Central Indic languages such as [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and [[Hindi language|Hindi]]. As a result, the number of people with a working knowledge of Tirhuta has dropped considerably in recent years.

==History and current status==
Before 14th CE, Tirhuta was exclusively used to write Sanskrit, later Maithili was written in this script. Despite the near universal switch from Tirhuta to the Devanagari script for writing Maithili, some traditional [[pandit|pundit]]s still use the script for sending one another ceremonial letters (''pātā'') related to some important function such as marriage. Fonts for this script were developed in 2003.&lt;ref name="n4035"/&gt;

The 2003 inclusion of Maithili in the VIIIth Schedule of the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]], having accorded official recognition to it as a language independent of Hindi, there is a possibility that this might lead to efforts to re-implement Tirhuta on a wider basis, in accord with similar trends in India reinforcing separate identities. However, currently, only Maithili in the Devanagari script is officially recognized.

[[File:Cows on Selsley Common - geograph.org.uk - 192472.jpg|thumb|Cows on [[Selsley Common]]. The "tragedy of the commons" is one way of accounting for [[overexploitation]].]]

The '''tragedy of the commons''' is a term used in [[social science]] to describe a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action. The concept and phrase originated in an essay written in 1833 by the British economist [[William Forster Lloyd]], who used a hypothetical example of the effects of unregulated grazing on [[common land]] (also known as a "common") in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name=forster&gt;{{Cite book |title=Two lectures on the checks to population |last=Lloyd |first=William Forster |publisher=Oxford University |year=1833 |isbn= |location=England |pages= |url=https://archive.org/details/twolecturesonch00lloygoog |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept became widely known over a century later due to an article written by the American ecologist and philosopher [[Garrett Hardin]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=hardin68 /&gt;  In this modern economic context, [[commons]] is taken to mean any shared and unregulated resource such as [[Carbon dioxide#In the Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[Great Pacific garbage patch|oceans]], [[river|rivers]], [[fish stocks]], or even an office refrigerator.

It has been argued {{By whom|date=September 2018}} that the very term 'tragedy of the Commons' is a misnomer, since 'the commons' referred to land resources with rights jointly owned by members of a community, and no individual outside the community had any access to the resource. However, the term is now used in social science and economics when describing a problem where ''all'' individuals have equal and open access to a resource. Hence, 'tragedy of open access regimes' or simply 'the open access problem' are more apt terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Daly |first1=Herman E. |last2=Farley |first2=Joshua |authorlink1=Herman Daly |date=2011 |title=Ecological Economics. Principles and Applications. |edition=2nd |url=http://library.uniteddiversity.coop/Measuring_Progress_and_Eco_Footprinting/Ecological_Economics-Principles_and_Applications.pdf |format=PDF contains full textbook |location=Washington |publisher=Island Press |isbn=9781597266819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'tragedy of the commons' is often cited in connection with [[sustainable development]], meshing economic growth and environmental protection, as well as in the [[Global warming controversy|debate over global warming]]. It has also been used in analyzing behavior in the fields of [[economics]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[game theory]], [[politics]], [[taxation]] and [[sociology]].

Although common resource systems have been known to collapse due to overuse (such as in [[over-fishing]]), many examples have existed and still do exist where members of a community with access to a common resource co-operate or regulate to exploit those resources prudently without collapse.&lt;ref name="Robert Wade 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Management|first1=National Research Council (U S. ) Panel on Common Property Resource|title=Proceedings of the Conference on Common Property Resource Management, April 21-26, 1985|date=1986|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cCkrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=Common+property+resource+management+in+South+Indian+Villages#v=onepage&amp;q=Common%20property%20resource%20management%20in%20South%20Indian%20Villages&amp;f=false|publisher=National Academies|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dlc.dlib.indiana.edu"&gt;Susan Jane Buck Cox - "No tragedy on the Commons" ''Journal of Environmental Ethics'', Vol 7, Spring 1985 [http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/3113/buck_NoTragedy.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elinor Ostrom]] was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for demonstrating exactly this concept in her book Governing the Commons, which included examples of how local communities were able to do this without top-down regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2009/ostrom-facts.html|title=Elinor Ostrom - Facts|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lloyd's pamphlet===
In 1833, the English economist [[William Forster Lloyd]] published a pamphlet which included a hypothetical example of over-use of a common resource. This was the situation of cattle herders sharing a common parcel of land on which they are each entitled to let their cows graze, as was the custom in English villages. He postulated that if a herder put more than his allotted number of cattle on the common, [[overgrazing]] could result. For each additional animal, a herder could receive additional benefits, but the whole group shared damage to the commons. If all herders made this individually rational economic decision, the common could be depleted or even destroyed, to the detriment of all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lloyd |first=William Forster |title=Two Lectures on Population |year=1833 |jstor=1972412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, [[ecology|ecologist]] [[Garrett Hardin]] explored this [[social dilemma]] in his article "The Tragedy of the Commons", published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref name=hardin68&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |pages=1243–1248 |year=1968 |pmid=5699198 |pmc= |author1=Hardin |first1=G|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/162/3859/1243.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abstract: "The population problem has no technical solution; it requires a fundamental extension in morality".&lt;/ref&gt; The essay derived its title from the pamphlet by [[William Forster Lloyd|Lloyd]], which he cites, on the over-grazing of common land.

Hardin discussed problems that cannot be solved by technical means, as distinct from those with solutions that require "a change only in the techniques of the [[natural science]]s, demanding little or nothing in the way of change in [[Value (personal and cultural)|human values]] or ideas of [[morality]]". Hardin focused on human population growth, the use of the Earth's [[natural resource]]s, and the welfare state.&lt;ref name="Intolerable"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hardin |first=G. |authorlink=Garrett Hardin |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=162 |issue=3859 |date=1968-12-13 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/162/3859/1243.full.pdf |quote=it is the role of education to reveal to all the necessity of abandoning the freedom to breed. Only so, can we put an end to this aspect of the tragedy of the commons. |pages=1243–1248 |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |pmid=5699198 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardin argued that if individuals relied on themselves alone, and not on the relationship of society and man, then the number of children had by each family would not be of public concern. Parents breeding excessively would leave fewer descendants because they would be unable to provide for each child adequately. Such negative feedback is found in the animal kingdom.&lt;ref name="Intolerable" /&gt; Hardin said that if the children of improvident parents starved to death, if overbreeding was its own punishment, then there would be no public interest in controlling the breeding of families.&lt;ref name="Intolerable" /&gt; Hardin blamed the [[welfare state]] for allowing the tragedy of the commons; where the state provides for children and supports overbreeding as a fundamental human right, [[Malthusian catastrophe]] is inevitable. Consequently, in his article, Hardin lamented the following proposal from the [[United Nations]]:
{{quote|text= The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] describes the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society. [Article 16&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights |date=10 December 1948 |accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;] It follows that any choice and decision with regard to the size of the family must irrevocably rest with the family itself, and cannot be made by anyone else. |source= Statement on Population by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]&lt;ref name="U Thant Statement"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Levels and trends of contraceptive use as assessed in 2002 |publisher=United Nations Publications |last=United Nations.

In addition, Hardin also pointed out the problem of individuals acting in rational self-interest by claiming that if all members in a group used common resources for their own gain and with no regard for others, all resources would still eventually be depleted. Overall, Hardin argued against relying on [[conscience]] as a means of policing commons, suggesting that this favors [[selfish]] individuals&amp;nbsp;– often known as [[free rider problem|free riders]]&amp;nbsp;– over those who are more altruistic.

In the context of avoiding [[over-exploitation]] of [[Common-pool resource|common resources]], Hardin concluded by restating [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s [[Maxim (saying)|maxim]] (which was quoted by [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]), "freedom is the recognition of necessity". He suggested that "freedom" completes the tragedy of the commons. By recognizing resources as commons in the first place, and by recognizing that, as such, they require management, Hardin believed that humans "can preserve and nurture other and more precious freedoms".

===The "Commons" as a modern resource concept===
Hardin's article was the start of the modern use of "Commons" as a term connoting a shared resource. As Frank van Laerhoven &amp; Elinor Ostrom have stated: "Prior to the publication of Hardin’s article on the tragedy of the commons (1968), titles containing the words 'the commons', 'common pool resources,' or 'common property' were very rare in the academic literature." They go on to say: "In 2002, Barrett and Mabry conducted a major survey of biologists to determine which publications in the twentieth century had become classic books or benchmark publications in biology. They report that Hardin’s 1968 article was the one having the greatest career impact on biologists and is the most frequently cited".&lt;ref&gt;Traditions and Trends in the Study of the Commons Frank van Laerhoven &amp; Elinor Ostrom International Journal of the Commons Vol 1, no 1 October 2007, pp. 3-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

===Metaphoric meaning===
Like Lloyd and [[Thomas Malthus]] before him, Hardin was primarily interested in the problem of [[Human overpopulation|human population growth]]. But in his essay, he also focused on the use of larger (though finite) resources such as the Earth's atmosphere and oceans, as well as pointing out the "negative commons" of pollution (i.e., instead of dealing with the deliberate privatization of a positive resource, a "negative commons" deals with the deliberate commonization of a negative cost, pollution).

As a [[metaphor]], the tragedy of the commons should not be taken too literally. The "tragedy" is not in the word's conventional or theatric sense, nor a condemnation of the processes that lead to it. Similarly, Hardin's use of "commons" has frequently been misunderstood, leading him to later remark that he should have titled his work "The Tragedy of the Unregulated Commons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2006/07/26/life/will-commons-sense-dawn-again-in-time/ |title=Will commons sense dawn again in time? &amp;#124; The Japan Times Online |publisher=Search.japantimes.co.jp |date=2006-07-26 |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hardin |first=Garrett |title=Extensions of "The Tragedy of the Commons" |journal=Science |date=May 1, 1998 |volume=280 |issue=5364 |pages=682–683 |doi=10.1126/science.280.5364.682 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/280/5364/682.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metaphor illustrates the argument that free access and unrestricted demand for a finite resource ultimately reduces the resource through [[over-exploitation]], temporarily or permanently. This occurs because the benefits of exploitation accrue to individuals or groups, each of whom is motivated to maximize use of the resource to the point in which they become reliant on it, while the costs of the exploitation are borne by all those to whom the resource is available (which may be a wider class of individuals than those who are exploiting it). This, in turn, causes demand for the resource to increase, which causes the problem to snowball until the resource collapses (even if it retains a capacity to recover). The rate at which depletion of the resource is realized depends primarily on three factors: the number of users wanting to consume the common in question, the consumptiveness of their uses, and the relative robustness of the common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=1227745 |title=Brigham Daniels, Emerging Commons Tragic Institutions |journal=Environmental Law |volume=37 |date=2007 |pages=515–571 at 536 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same concept is sometimes called the "tragedy of the fishers", because fishing too many fish before or during breeding could cause stocks to plummet.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Bowles: Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution, [[Princeton University Press]], pp. 27–29 (2004) {{ISBN|0-691-09163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern commons===
The ''tragedy of the commons'' can be considered in relation to environmental issues such as [[sustainability]]. The commons dilemma stands as a model for a great variety of resource problems in society today, such as water, forests,&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Andersson [http://wildfirenews.com/oregon "Tragedy of the Common Forest"] Oregon Daily Emerald&lt;/ref&gt; fish, and [[non-renewable energy]] sources such as oil and coal.

Situations exemplifying the "tragedy of the commons" include the overfishing and destruction of the [[Grand Banks]], the destruction of [[salmon]] runs on rivers that have been dammed – most prominently in modern times on the [[Columbia River]] in the [[Northwest United States]], and historically in [[North Atlantic]] rivers – the devastation of the sturgeon fishery – in modern Russia, but historically in the United States as well – and, in terms of water supply, the limited water available in arid regions (e.g., the area of the [[Aral Sea]]) and the [[Los Angeles]] water system supply, especially at [[Mono Lake]] and [[Owens Lake]].

In economics, an [[externality]] is a cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit.  Negative externalities are a well-known feature of the "tragedy of the commons".  For example, driving cars has many negative externalities; these include [[pollution]], [[carbon emissions]], and traffic accidents. Every time 'Person A' gets in a car, it becomes more likely that 'Person Z'{{spaced ndash}} and millions of others{{spaced ndash}} will suffer in each of those areas.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Dunber and Steven D. Levitt [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/magazine/20wwln-freakonomics-t.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;oref=slogin "Not-So-Free-Ride"] The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;  Economists often urge the government to adopt policies that "internalize" an externality.&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, William. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uhBkp5rmrXgC&amp;pg=PA80 Environmental Economics for Tree Huggers and Other Skeptics]'', p. 80 (Island Press 2012): "Economists often say that externalities need to be 'internalized,' meaning that some action needs to be taken to correct this kind of market failure."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application to evolutionary biology===
A parallel was drawn recently between the tragedy of the commons and the competing behaviour of parasites that through acting selfishly eventually diminish or destroy their common host.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000452/http://eao.igc.gulbenkian.pt/ENS/dionisio_evol_econ_rivalry_excludability.pdf The tragedy of the commons, the public goods dilemma, and the meaning of rivalry and excludability in evolutionary biology] ''Francisco Dionisio and Isabel Gordo'' Evolutionary Ecology Research 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The idea has also been applied to areas such as the evolution of [[virulence]] or [[sexual conflict]], where males may fatally harm females when competing for matings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kokkonuts.org/wp-content/uploads/Sexdeathtragedy.pdf Sex, death and tragedy] ''Daniel J.

==Commons dilemma==
{{anchor|The Commons Dilemma}}
The ''commons dilemma'' is a specific class of [[social dilemma]] in which people's short-term selfish interests are at odds with long-term group interests and the [[common good]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Druzin |first=Bryan |title=A Plan to strengthen the Paris Agreement |url=https://works.bepress.com/bryan_druzin/18/ |journal=Fordham Law Review |volume=84 |pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In academia, a range of related terminology has also been used as shorthand for the theory or aspects of it, including ''resource dilemma'', ''take-some dilemma'', and ''[[common pool resource]]''.

Commons dilemma researchers have studied conditions under which groups and communities are likely to under- or [[over-harvest]] common resources in both the laboratory and field. Research programs have concentrated on a number of motivational, strategic, and structural factors that might be conducive to management of commons.

In [[game theory]], which constructs mathematical models for individuals' behavior in strategic situations, the corresponding "game", developed by Hardin, is known as the Commonize Costs&amp;nbsp;– Privatize Profits Game ([[CC–PP game]]).

===Psychological factors===
Kopelman, Weber, &amp; Messick (2002), in a review of the experimental research on cooperation in commons dilemmas, identify nine classes of independent variables that influence cooperation in commons dilemmas: social motives, gender, payoff structure, uncertainty, power and status, group size, communication, causes, and frames. They organize these classes and distinguish between psychological individual differences (stable personality traits) and situational factors (the environment). Situational factors include both the task (social and decision structure) and the perception of the task.&lt;ref&gt;Kopelman, Weber, &amp; Messick, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Empirical findings support the theoretical argument that the cultural group is a critical factor that needs to be studied in the context of situational variables.&lt;ref&gt;Gelfand &amp; Dyer, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than behaving in line with economic incentives, people are likely to approach the decision to cooperate with an appropriateness framework.&lt;ref&gt;Weber et al., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; An expanded, four factor model of the Logic of Appropriateness,&lt;ref&gt;Kopelman, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myers &amp; Kopelman, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the cooperation is better explained by the question: "What does a person like me (identity) do (rules) in a situation like this (recognition) given this culture (group)?"

===Strategic factors===
[[Strategy|Strategic]] factors also matter in commons dilemmas. One often-studied strategic factor is the order in which people take harvests from the resource. In simultaneous play, all people harvest at the same time, whereas in sequential play people harvest from the pool according to a predetermined sequence&amp;nbsp;– first, second, third, etc. There is a clear order effect in the latter games: the harvests of those who come first&amp;nbsp;– the leaders&amp;nbsp;– are higher than the harvest of those coming later&amp;nbsp;– the followers. The interpretation of this effect is that the first players feel entitled to take more. With sequential play, individuals adopt a first come-first served rule, whereas with simultaneous play people may adopt an equality rule. Another strategic factor is the ability to build up reputations. Research {{By whom|date=December 2011}} found that people take less from the common pool in public situations than in anonymous private situations. Moreover, those who harvest less gain greater prestige and influence within their group.

===Structural factors===
Much research has focused on when and why people would like to structurally rearrange the commons to prevent a tragedy. Hardin stated in his analysis of the tragedy of the commons that "Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all."&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, 1244&lt;/ref&gt; One of the proposed solutions is to appoint a leader to regulate access to the common. Groups are more likely to endorse a leader when a common resource is being depleted and when managing a common resource is perceived as a difficult task. Groups prefer leaders who are elected, democratic, and prototypical of the group, and these leader types are more successful in enforcing cooperation. A general aversion to autocratic [[leadership]] exists, although it may be an effective solution, possibly because of the fear of power abuse and corruption.

The provision of rewards and punishments may also be effective in preserving common resources. Selective punishments for overuse can be effective in promoting domestic water and energy conservation&amp;nbsp;– for example, through installing water and electricity meters in houses. Selective rewards work, provided that they are open to everyone. An experimental carpool lane in the Netherlands failed because car commuters did not feel they were able to organize a carpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=van Vugt |first=M. |last2=van Lange |first2=P.

==Solutions==
{{see also|Externality#Possible solutions}}
Articulating solutions to the tragedy of the commons is one of the main problems of [[political philosophy]]. In many situations, locals implement (often complex) social schemes that work well. The best governmental solution may be to do nothing. When these fail, there are many possible governmental solutions such as privatization, internalizing the externalities, and regulation.

===Non-governmental solution===
Sometimes the best governmental solution may be to do nothing. [[Robert Axelrod]] contends that even self-interested individuals will often find ways to cooperate, because collective restraint serves both the collective and individual interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Axelrod |first=Robert |year=1984 |title=The Evolution of Cooperation |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02121-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NJZBCGbNs98C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist G. N. Appell criticized those who cited Hardin to "impos[e] their own economic and environmental rationality on other social systems of which they have incomplete understanding and knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Appell, G. N. (1993). [http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/handle/10535/4532 Hardin's Myth of the Commons: The Tragedy of Conceptual Confusions]. Working Paper 8. Phillips, ME: Social Transformation and Adaptation Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientist [[Elinor Ostrom]], who was awarded 2009's [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] for her work on the issue, and others revisited Hardin's work in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ostrom |first1=Elinor |last2=Burger |first2=Joanna |last3=Field |first3=Christopher B. |last4=Norgaard |first4=Richard B. |last5=Policansky |first5=David |year=1999 |title=Revisiting the Commons: Local Lessons, Global Challenges |url= http://dusk2.geo.orst.edu/prosem/Ostrom_etal1999.pdf|journal=Science |volume=284 |issue= 5412|pages=278–282 |doi=10.1126/science.284.5412.278 |pmid=10195886|format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; They found the tragedy of the commons not as prevalent or as difficult to solve as Hardin maintained, since locals have often come up with solutions to the commons problem themselves.&lt;ref name="urlOstrom revisits the commons in Science"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iuinfo.indiana.edu/HomePages/041699/text/ostrom.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182446/http://www.iuinfo.indiana.edu/HomePages/041699/text/ostrom.htm |archivedate=2012-03-05 |title=Ostrom 'revisits the commons' in 'Science' |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it was found that a commons in the Swiss Alps has been run by a collective of farmers there to their mutual and individual benefit since 1517, in spite of the farmers also having access to their own farmland. In general, it is in the users of a commons interests to keep the common running and complex social schemes are often invented by the users for maintaining them at optimum efficiency.&lt;ref name=beyond /&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/10/12/elinor-ostrom-commons-nobel-economics-opinions-contributors-vernon-l-smith.html|title=Governing The Commons|first=Vernon L.|last=Smith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, geographer Douglas L. Johnson remarks that many [[nomadic pastoralism|nomadic pastoralist]] societies of Africa and the Middle East in fact "balanced local stocking ratios against seasonal rangeland conditions in ways that were ecologically sound", reflecting a desire for lower risk rather than higher profit; in spite of this, it was often the case that "the nomad was blamed for problems that were not of his own making and were a product of alien forces."&lt;ref name="johnson1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Douglas L. |date=1993 |title=Nomadism and Desertification in Africa and the Middle East |journal=GeoJournal |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=51–66 |url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/382/art%253A10.1007%252FBF00815903.pdf?auth66=1421130745_ae3711f8ec80384f3be245bd003e8be5&amp;ext=.pdf |doi=10.1007/bf00815903}}{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independently finding precedent in the opinions of previous scholars such as [[Ibn Khaldun]] as well as common currency in antagonistic cultural attitudes towards non-sedentary peoples,&lt;ref name="johnson1993" /&gt; governments and international organizations have made use of Hardin's work to help justify restrictions on land access and the eventual [[sedentarization]] of pastoral nomads despite its weak empirical basis. Examining relations between historically nomadic [[Bedouin]] Arabs and the [[Syria]]n state in the 20th century, [[Dawn Chatty]] notes that "Hardin's argument […] was curiously accepted as the fundamental explanation for the degradation of the [[steppe]] land" in development schemes for the arid interior of the country, downplaying the larger role of agricultural [[overexploitation]] in [[desertification]] as it melded with prevailing nationalist ideology which viewed nomads as socially backward and economically harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chatty |first=Dawn |date=2010 |title=The Bedouin in Contemporary Syria: The Persistence of Tribal Authority and Control |journal=Middle East Journal |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=29–69 |url=https://www.academia.edu/4240985/Tribes_of_Syria |doi=10.3751/64.1.12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elinor Ostrom]], and her colleagues looked at how real-world communities manage communal resources, such as fisheries, land irrigation systems, and farmlands, and they identified a number of factors conducive to successful resource management. One factor is the resource itself; resources with definable boundaries (e.g., land) can be preserved much more easily. A second factor is resource dependence; there must be a perceptible threat of resource depletion, and it must be difficult to find substitutes. The third is the presence of a community; small and stable populations with a thick social network and social norms promoting conservation do better.&lt;ref name=beyond&gt;Elinor Ostrom: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByXM47Ri1Kc ''Beyond the tragedy of commons'']. Stockholm whiteboard seminars. (Video, 8:26 min.)&lt;/ref&gt; A final condition is that there be appropriate community-based rules and procedures in place with built-in incentives for responsible use and punishments for overuse. When the commons is taken over by non-locals, those solutions can no longer be used.&lt;ref name="urlOstrom revisits the commons in Science" /&gt;

===Governmental solutions===
Governmental solutions may be necessary when the above conditions are not met (such as a community being too big or too unstable to provide a thick social network). Examples of government regulation include privatization, regulation, and internalizing the externalities.

====Privatization====
One solution for some resources is to convert common good into private property, giving the new owner an incentive to enforce its sustainability. [[libertarianism|Libertarians]] and [[classical liberalism|classical liberals]] cite the tragedy of the commons as an example of what happens when [[John Locke|Lockean]] property rights to homestead resources are prohibited by a government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Robert J. |last=Smith |title=Resolving the Tragedy of the Commons by Creating Private Property Rights in Wildlife |url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/1981/11/cj1n2-7.pdf |publisher=[[Cato Institute]] |series=[[Cato Journal]] |volume=1 |issue=2 |date=Fall 1981 |pages=439–468}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the solution to the tragedy of the commons is to allow individuals to take over the property rights of a resource, that is, to privatize it.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Locke]], "Sect. 27" and following sections in [https://web.archive.org/web/20070304114414/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/locke/locke2/locke2nd-a.html#Sect.%2025.#Sect.%2027. ''Second Treatise of Government''] (1690). Also available [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/7370 here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, this solution was attempted in the [[Inclosure Acts]].

====Regulation====
In a typical example, governmental regulations can limit the amount of a common good that is available for use by any individual. Permit systems for extractive economic activities including mining, fishing, hunting, livestock raising and timber extraction are examples of this approach. Similarly, limits to pollution are examples of governmental intervention on behalf of the commons. This idea is used by the [[United Nations]] [[Moon Treaty]], [[Outer Space Treaty]] and [[Law of the Sea Treaty]] as well as the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Convention]] which involves the international law principle that designates some areas or resources the [[Common Heritage of Mankind]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Frakes, The Common Heritage of Mankind Principle and the Deep Seabed, Outer Space, and Antarctica: Will Developed and Developing Nations Reach a Compromise? Wisconsin International Law Journal. 2003; 21:409&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hardin's essay, he proposed that the solution to the problem of overpopulation must be based on "mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon" and result in "relinquishing the freedom to breed". Hardin discussed this topic further in a 1979 book, ''Managing the Commons,'' co-written with [[John A. Baden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecobooks.com/books/commons.htm |title=Managing the Commons by Garrett Hardin and John Baden |publisher=Ecobooks.com |accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He framed this prescription in terms of needing to restrict the "[[reproductive rights|reproductive right]]", to safeguard all other [[rights]]. Several countries have a variety of [[Antinatalistic politics|population control laws]] in place.

German historian [[Joachim Radkau]] thought Hardin advocates strict management of common goods via increased government involvement or international regulation bodies.&lt;ref name="Rad"&gt;Radkau, Joachim. Nature and Power. A Global History of the Environment. Cambridge University Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; An asserted impending "tragedy of the commons" is frequently warned of as a consequence of the adoption of policies which restrict [[Property#Theories of property|private property]] and espouse expansion of public property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |authorlink=Natalia Mirovitskaya, Marvin S.

====Internalizing externalities====
Privatization works when the person who owns the property (or rights of access to that property) pays the full price of its exploitation. As discussed above negative externalities (negative results, such as air or water pollution, that do not proportionately affect the user of the resource) is often a feature driving the tragedy of the commons. ''Internalizing the externalities'', in other words ensuring that the users of resource pay for all of the consequences of its use, can provide an alternate solution between privatization and regulation. One example is gasoline taxes which are intended to include both the cost of road maintenance and of air pollution. This solution can provide the flexibility of privatization while minimizing the amount of government oversight and overhead that is needed.

==Criticism==
The environmentalist [[Derrick Jensen]] claims the tragedy of the commons is used as [[propaganda]] for [[private ownership]].&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Derrick (2007), "Endame Vol 1: The Problem of Civilisation" and "Endame Vol II: Resistance" (Seven Stories Press)&lt;/ref&gt;  He says it has been used by the political [[right wing]] to hasten the final enclosure of the "common resources" of [[third world]] and indigenous people worldwide, as a part of the [[Washington Consensus]].  He argues that in true situations, those who abuse the commons would have been warned to desist and if they failed would have punitive sanctions against them.  He says that rather than being called "The Tragedy of the Commons", it should be called "the Tragedy of the Failure of the Commons".

Hardin's work was also criticised&lt;ref name="urlwww.econ.cam.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/faculty/dasgupta/ |authorlink=Partha Dasgupta |first=Partha |last=Dasgupta |title=Human Well-Being and the Natural Environment |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; as historically inaccurate in failing to account for the [[demographic transition]], and for failing to distinguish between [[Common-pool resource|common property]] and [[Open access (infrastructure)|open access]] resources.&lt;ref name=Ciriacy&gt;Ciriacy-Wantrup S.V., Bishop R.C., 1975. "Common Property" as a Concept in Natural Resources Policy. Nat. Res. J. 15, 713–727&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Carl Dahlman argues that commons were effectively managed to prevent overgrazing.&lt;ref name="urlSpringerLink"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/wm68g57188j282u4/ |title= The tragedy of the commons that wasn't: On technical solutions to the institutions game|accessdate= | doi=10.1007/BF01357919 |volume=12 |issue= 3|year=1991 |journal=Population and Environment |pages=285–296 | last1 = Dahlman | first1 = Carl J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Susan Jane Buck Cox argues that the common land example used to argue this economic concept is on very weak historical ground, and misrepresents what she terms was actually the "triumph of the commons": the successful common usage of land for many centuries. She argues that social changes and agricultural innovation, and not the behaviour of the commoners, led to the demise of the commons.&lt;ref name="dlc.dlib.indiana.edu"/&gt; 

Some authors, like [[Yochai Benkler]], say that with the rise of the Internet and digitalisation, an economics system based on commons becomes possible again. He wrote in his book ''[[The Wealth of Networks]]'' in 2006 that cheap computing power plus networks enable people to produce valuable products through non-commercial processes of interaction: "as human beings and as social beings, rather than as market actors through the price system". He uses the term 'networked [[information economy]]' to describe a "system of production, distribution, and consumption of information goods characterized by decentralized individual action carried out through widely distributed, nonmarket means that do not depend on market strategies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Benkler, Yochai |title=The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-300-11056-2 |oclc= |doi= |page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X0Q0mAEACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also coined the term '[[commons-based peer production]]' to describe collaborative efforts based on sharing information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Steven Johnson (author)|Steven Johnson]] |coauthors= |title=The Internet? We Built That |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/magazine/the-internet-we-built-that.html?src=dayp |quote=The Harvard legal scholar Yochai Benkler has called this phenomenon 'commons-based peer production'. |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=September 21, 2012 |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of commons-based peer production are [[free and open source software]] and [[open-source hardware]].

==Comedy of the commons==
In certain cases, exploiting a resource more may be a good thing. Carol M. Rose, in a 1986 article, discussed the concept of the "comedy of the commons", where the public property in question exhibits "increasing returns to scale" in usage (hence the phrase, "the more the merrier"), in that the more people use the resource, the higher the benefit to each one. Rose cites as examples commerce and group recreational activities. According to Rose, public resources with the "comedic" characteristic may suffer from under-investment rather than over usage.&lt;ref name="rose"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2827&amp;context=fss_papers |title=The Comedy of the Commons: Commerce, Custom, and Inherently Public Property |author=Rose, Carol M. |journal=Faculty Scholarship Series, Yale Law School |year=1986 |volume=Paper 1828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trance''' is an abnormal state of wakefulness in which a person is not self-aware and is either altogether unresponsive to external stimuli but is nevertheless capable of pursuing and realizing an aim, or is selectively responsive in following the directions of the person who has induced the trance. Trance states may occur involuntarily and unbidden.

The term ''trance'' may be associated with [[hypnosis]], [[meditation]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[flow (psychology)|flow]], and [[prayer]]. It may also be related to the earlier generic term, [[altered states of consciousness]], which is no longer used in "[[transpersonal psychology|consciousness studies]]" discourse.

==Etymology==

Trance in its modern meaning comes from an earlier meaning of "a dazed, half-conscious or insensible condition or state of fear", via the Old French ''transe'' "fear of evil", from the [[Latin]] ''transīre'' "to cross", "pass over". This definition is now obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=trance |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working models==

Wier, in his 1995 book, ''Trance: from magic to technology'', defines a simple trance (p.&amp;nbsp;58) as a state of mind being caused by cognitive loops where a cognitive object (thoughts, images, sounds, intentional actions) repeats long enough to result in various sets of disabled cognitive functions. Wier represents all trances (which include sleep and watching television) as taking place on a dissociated trance plane where at least some cognitive functions such as volition are disabled; as is seen in what is typically termed a 'hypnotic trance'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trance.edu/drupal/node/26 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208040631/http://www.trance.edu/drupal/node/26 |archivedate=8 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With this definition, meditation, hypnosis, addictions and charisma are seen as being trance states. In Wier's 2007 book, ''The Way of Trance'', he elaborates on these forms, adds ecstasy as an additional form and discusses the ethical implications of his model, including magic and government use which he terms "trance abuse".

[[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]] in ''Rational Mysticism'' (2003) explores the neurological mechanisms and psychological implications of trances and other [[mystical]] manifestations. Horgan incorporates literature and case-studies from a number of disciplines in this work: [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[psychology]], [[radiology]] and [[theology]].

==Working definitions==
The following are some examples of trance states:
* [[Incantation|Enchantment]]: a [[psychological]] state induced by (or as if induced by) a magical [[incantation]]
* A state of mind in which consciousness is fragile and voluntary action is poor or missing
* A state resembling deep [[sleep]]
* Capture: attract; cause to be enamored; "She/he captured all the men's hearts"; in the sense of entranced
* A condition of apparent sleep or unconsciousness, with marked physiological characteristics, in which the body of the subject is thought by certain people to be liable to [[spirit possession|possession]]
* An [[out-of-body experience]] in which one feels they have passed out of the body into another state of [[being]], a [[rapture]], an [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]]. In a general way, the entranced conditions thus defined are divided into varying degrees of a negative, [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] state, and into progressive gradations of a positive, conscious, illumining condition.
* A state of hyper or enhanced [[suggestibility]].
* An induced or [[wikt:spontaneous|spontaneous]] sleep-like condition of an [[altered state of consciousness]], which is thought by certain people to permit the subject's physical body to be utilized by disembodied spirits or entities as a means of [[Symbolic expression|expression]]
* An altered state of awareness induced via [[hypnosis]] in which unconscious or dissociated responses to suggestion are enhanced in quality and increased in degree
* A state induced by the use of [[hypnosis]]; the person accepts the suggestions of the hypnotist
* A state of consciousness characterized by extreme [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]] often to the point of appearing [[unconsciousness|unconscious]].

Trance conditions include all the different states of [[mind]], [[emotion]]s, [[mood (psychology)|moods]] and [[daydream]]s that human beings experience. All activities which engage a human involve the filtering of information coming into sense modalities, and this influences brain functioning and consciousness. Therefore, trance may be understood as a way for the mind to change the way it filters information in order to provide more efficient use of the mind's resources.

Trance states may also be accessed or induced by various [[wikt:modality|modalities]] and is a way of accessing the [[unconscious mind]] for the purposes of [[relaxation technique|relaxation]], [[healing]], [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] and [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]]. There is an extensive documented history of trance as evidenced by the case-studies of anthropologists and ethnologists and associated and derivative disciplines. Hence trance may be perceived as endemic to the [[human condition]] and a [[cultural universal|Human Universal]]. Principles of trance are being explored and documented as are methods of trance induction. Benefits of trance states are being explored by medical and scientific inquiry. Many traditions and rituals employ trance. Trance also has a function in religion and mystical experience.

Castillo (1995) states that: "Trance phenomena result from the behavior of intense focusing of attention, which is the key psychological mechanism of trance induction. Adaptive responses, including institutionalized forms of trance, are 'tuned' into neural networks in the brain and depend to a large extent on the characteristics of culture. Culture-specific organizations exist in the structure of individual neurons and in the organizational formation of neural networks."

Hoffman (1998: p.&amp;nbsp;9) states that: "Trance is still conventionally defined as a state of reduced [[consciousness]], or a somnolent state. However, the more recent [[anthropological]] definition, linking it to '[[altered states of consciousness]]' ([[Charles Tart]]), is becoming increasingly accepted."

Hoffman (1998, p.&amp;nbsp;9) asserts that: "...the trance state should be discussed in the plural, because there is more than one altered state of consciousness significantly different from everyday consciousness."

==Origins and history==

===Temple of Epidaurus: healing sleep===
According to Hoffman (1998: p.&amp;nbsp;10), [[pilgrims]] visited the [[Temple]] of [[Epidaurus]], an [[asclepeion]], in [[Greece]] for healing sleep. Seekers of healing would make [[pilgrimage]] and be received by a [[priest]] who would welcome and [[blessing|bless]] them. This temple housed an ancient [[religious]] [[ritual]] promoting [[dreams]] in the seeker that endeavored to promote healing and the solutions to problems, as did the [[oracles]]. This temple was built in honor of [[Asclepios]], the Greek god of medicine. The Greek treatment was referred to as [[incubation (ritual)|incubation]], and focused on [[prayers]] to Asclepios for healing. The [[asclepion]] at [[Epidaurus]] is both extensive and well-preserved, and is traditionally regarded as the birthplace of [[Asclepius]]. (For a comparable modern tool see [[Dreamwork]].)

The [[Pythia|Oracle at Delphi]] was also famous for trances in the ancient Greek world;  priestesses there would make [[divination|predictions about the future]] in exchange for [[gold]].

===Oral lore and storytelling===
Stories of the [[saints]] in the [[Middle Ages]], [[mythology|myths]], [[parables]], [[fairy tales]], [[oral lore]] and [[storytelling]] from different cultures are themselves potentially inducers of trance. Often [[rhetorical device|literary devices]] such as [[repetition (rhetorical)|repetition]] are employed which is evident in many forms of trance induction. [[Milton Erickson]] used stories to induce trance as do many [[Neuro-linguistic programming|NLP]] practitioners.

===Military===
From at least the 16th century it was held that [[march music]] may induce soldiers marching in unison into trance states where according to apologists, they bond together as a unit engendered by the rigors of training, the ties of comradeship and the chain of command. This had the effect of making the soldiers become automated, an effect which was widely evident in the 16th, 17th and 18th century due to the increasing prevalence of firearms employed in warcraft. Military instruments, especially the [[snare drum]] and other drums were used to entone a monotonous [[ostinato]] at the pace of march and heartbeat. High-pitched [[fife (musical instrument)|fifes]], [[flute]]s and [[bagpipe]]s were used for their "piercing" effect to play the melody. This would assist the morale and solidarity of soldiers as they marched to battle.

[[Joseph Jordania]] recently proposed a term battle trance for this mental state, when [[combatant]]s do not feel [[fear]] and [[pain]], and when they lose their [[Personal identity|individual identity]] and acquire a [[collective identity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Jordania]], [[Why do People Sing? Music in Human Evolution]]. Logos, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Berserker|Norse Berserkers]] induced a trance-like state before battle, called ''Berserkergang''. It is said to have given the warriors superhuman strength and made them impervious to pain during battle. This form of trance could have been induced partly due to ingestion of [[Amanita muscaria|hallucinogenic mushrooms]].

===Mystics===
As the mystical experience of [[mysticism|mystics]] generally entails direct connection, communication and communion with [[Deity]], Godhead and/or [[god]]; trance and cognate experience are endemic. (see [[Yoga]], [[Sufism]], [[Shaman]], [[Umbanda]], [[Crazy Horse]], etc.)

As shown by [[Jonathan Garb]],&lt;ref&gt;(Shamanic Trance in Modern Kabbalah, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; trance techniques also played a role in [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], the mystical life of the circle of [[Moshe Hayyim Luzzatto]] and [[Hasidism]].

===Christian mystics===
Many [[Christian mystics]] are documented as having experiences that may be considered as cognate with trance, such as: [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[John of the Cross]], [[Meister Eckhart]], Saint Theresa (as seen in the Bernini sculpture) and [[Francis of Assisi]].

===Mesmer and the origin of hypnotherapy===
* [[Mesmer]], an influential but discredited promoter of trance states and their curative powers.
* [[Milton Erickson]], the founder of [[hypnotherapy]] who died in 1980, introduced trance and hypnosis to orthodox medicine and psychotherapy—hypnosis here is something different from traditional [[clinical hypnosis]].

===Trance in American Christianity===
[[Ann Taves|Taves]] (1999) charts the synonymic language of trance in the American Christian traditions: ''power'' or ''presence'' or ''indwelling'' of God, or Christ, or the Spirit, or spirits. Typical expressions include "the indwelling of the Spirit" ([[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]), "the witness of the Spirit" ([[John Wesley]]), "the power of God" (early American [[Methodists]]), being "filled with the Spirit of the Lord" (early [[Adventists]]; see [[charismatic Adventism]]), "communing with spirits" ([[Spiritualists]]), "the Christ within" ([[New Thought]]), "streams of holy fire and power" (Methodist [[Holiness movement|holiness]]), "a religion of the Spirit and Power" (the [[Emmanuel Movement]]), and "the baptism of the Holy Spirit" (early [[Pentecostal]]s). (Taves, 1999: 3)

===Trance and Anglo-American Protestants===
Taves (1999) well-referenced book on trance charts the experience of Anglo-American Protestants and those who left the Protestant movement beginning with the transatlantic awakening in the early 18th century and ending with the rise of the [[psychology of religion]] and the birth of [[Pentecostalism]] in the early 20th century. This book focuses on a class of seemingly involuntary acts alternately explained in [[religious]] and [[secular]] terminology. These involuntary experiences include uncontrolled bodily movements ([[Seizure|fits]], bodily exercises, falling as dead, [[catalepsy]], [[convulsions]]); spontaneous vocalizations (crying out, shouting, [[speaking in tongues]]); unusual sensory experiences (trances, [[hallucination|visions]], voices, [[clairvoyance]], [[out-of-body experiences]]); and alterations of [[consciousness]] and/or [[memory]] ([[dream]]s, [[wikt:somnium|somnium]], [[somnambulism]], mesmeric trance, mediumistic trance, [[hypnosis]], [[spirit possession|possession]], alternating personality) (Taves, 1999: 3).

==Trance induction and sensory modality==
Trance-like states are often interpreted as [[religious ecstasy]] or [[vision (religion)|visions]] and can be deliberately induced using a variety of techniques, including [[prayer]], [[religious ritual]]s, [[meditation]], [[pranayama]] ([[breathwork]] or breathing exercises), [[physical exercise]], [[coitus]] (and/or [[sex]]), [[music]], [[dancing]], [[sweating]] (e.g. [[sweat lodge]]), [[fasting]], [[thirst]]ing, and the consumption of [[psychotropic]] drugs such as [[spiritual use of cannabis|cannabis]]. [[Sensory modality]] is the [[Mediumship|channel]] or [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] for the induction of the trance. Sometimes an ecstatic experience takes place in occasion of contact with something or somebody perceived as extremely [[beauty|beautiful]] or [[holy]]. It may also happen without any known reason. The particular technique that an individual uses to induce ecstasy is usually one that is associated with that individual's particular [[religious]] and [[cultural]] [[traditions]]. As a result, an ecstatic experience is usually interpreted within the context of a particular individual's religious and cultural traditions. These interpretations often include statements about contact with [[supernatural]] or [[spiritual beings]], about receiving new information as a [[revelation]], also religion-related explanations of subsequent change of [[values]], [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and [[behavior]] (e.g. in case of [[religious conversion]]).

Benevolent, neutral and malevolent trances may be induced (intentionally, spontaneously and/or accidentally) by different methods:
* [[Hearing (sense)|Auditory]]: driving through the [[sense]] of [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] by [[chanting]], auditory [[story telling]], [[mantra]], [[overtone singing]], [[drum]]ming, [[music]], etc.;,
* [[Kinesthetic]]: driving through the [[sense]] of [[feeling]] and movement through the [[Laban Movement Analysis|kinesphere]] by [[ecstatic dance]], [[story telling]] by movement, [[mudra]], embodying [[ritual]]s, [[yoga]], [[breathwork]], [[oxygen]] deprivation, sexual stimulation etc.;
* Visual: driving through the [[sense]] of [[Visual perception|sight]] by [[yantra]], visual [[story telling]], [[mandala]], [[film|cinema]], [[theater]], [[art]], [[architecture]], [[beauty]], [[strobe lights]], [[form constants]], [[symmetry]];
* [[Olfactory]]: driving via [[scent]] through the [[sense]] of [[olfaction|smell]] by [[perfume]], [[pheromones]], [[incense]], [[flowers]], [[pollen]], indeed any scent for which we have an association or memory, etc.;
* [[Gustatory]]: driving through the [[sense]] of [[taste]] and [[indigestion]]; including: [[starvation]], [[herbs]], [[hallucinogens]] and [[drugs]]. As the intake of food and beverage entails intra-bodily chemical reactions through [[digestion]], some infer that all food may be considered medicine or drugs and therefore contribute to the induction of discernible psycho-physical states (see [[Ancient Medicine]]). Trance states can be attained through the ingestion of [[psychoactive drugs]], particularly [[psychedelic drug|psychedelics]], such as [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], [[Peyote]], [[psilocybin mushrooms]], [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], and [[MDMA]].
* Disciplines: [[Yoga]], [[Sufism]], [[Surat Shabd Yoga]]; [[meditation]];
* Miscellaneously: [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] accident, [[sleep deprivation]], [[nitrogen narcosis]] (deep diving), [[fever]], by the use of a [[sensory deprivation]] tank or mind-control techniques, [[hypnosis]], [[meditation]], [[prayer]];
* Naturally occurring: [[dreams]], [[lucid dreaming|lucid dreams]], [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]], [[ecstasy (state)|ecstasy]], [[psychosis]] as well as purported [[premonitions]], [[out-of-body experience]]s, and [[Mediumship|channeling]].

===Auditory driving and auditory art===
[[Charles Tart]] provides a useful working definition of auditory driving. It is the induction of trance through the sense of hearing. Auditory driving works through a process known as [[Brainwave entrainment|entrainment]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The usage of repetitive [[rhythms]] to induce trance states is an ancient phenomenon. Throughout the [[world]], shamanistic practitioners have been employing this method for [[millennia]]. [[Anthropologists]] and other researchers have documented the similarity of shamanistic auditory driving [[rituals]] among different cultures.

Said simply, entrainment is the synchronization of different rhythmic cycles. Breathing and heart rate have been shown to be affected by auditory stimulus, along with brainwave activity. The ability of rhythmic sound to affect human brainwave activity, especially [[theta rhythm|theta brainwaves]], is the essence of auditory driving, and is the cause of the altered states of consciousness that it can induce.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Visual driving and visual art===

Nowack and Feltman have recently published an article entitled "Eliciting the Photic Driving Response" which states that the EEG photic driving response is a sensitive neurophysiological measure which has been employed to assess chemical and drug effects, forms of epilepsy, neurological status of Alzheimer's patients, and physiological arousal. Photic driving also impacts upon the psychological climate of a person by producing increased visual imagery and decreased physiological and subjective arousal. In this research by Nowack and Feltman, all participants reported increased visual imagery during photic driving, as measured by their responses to an imagery questionnaire.

Dennis Wier (https://web.archive.org/web/20060915232957/http://www.trance.edu/papers/theory.htm Accessed: 6 December 2006) states that over two millennia ago [[Ptolemy]] and [[Apuleius]] found that differing rates of flickering lights affected states of awareness and sometimes induced epilepsy. Wier also asserts that it was discovered in the late 1920s that when light was shined on closed eyelids it resulted in an echoing production of brainwave frequencies. Wier also opined that in 1965 Grey employed a [[stroboscope]] to project rhythmic light flashes into the eyes at a rate of 10–25&amp;nbsp;Hz (cycles per second). Grey discovered that this stimulated similar brainwave activity.

Research by [[Thomas Budzynski]], [[Oestrander]] et al., in the use of brain machines suggest that [[photic]] driving via the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] and direct electrical stimulation and driving via other mechanisms and modalities, may [[entrainment (physics)|entrain]] processes of the brain facilitating [[learning theory (education)|rapid and enhanced learning]], produce deep [[relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]], [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]], an increase in [[creativity]], [[problem solving]] propensity and may be associated with enhanced concentration and accelerated learning. The [[theta rhythm|theta]] range and the border area between [[alpha wave|alpha]] and [[theta rhythm|theta]] has generated considerable research interest.

===Kinesthetic driving and somatic art===
[[Charles Tart]] provides a useful working definition of [[kinesthetic]] driving. It is the induction of trance through the [[sense]] of [[touch]], [[feeling]] or [[emotions]]. Kinesthetic driving works through a process known as [[Brainwave entrainment|entrainment]].

The [[rituals]] practiced by some [[sportsperson|athletes]] in preparing for contests are dismissed as [[superstition]], but this is a [[tool|device]] of [[sport psychologist]]s to help them to attain an ecstasy-like state. [[Joseph Campbell]] had a peak experience whilst [[running]]. [[Roger Bannister]] on breaking the four-minute mile (Cameron, 1993: 185): "No longer conscious of my movement, I discovered a new unity with nature. I had found a new source of power and beauty, a source I never dreamt existed." Roger Bannister later became a distinguished [[neurologist]].

Mechanisms and [[discipline]]s that include kinesthetic driving may include: [[dancing]], [[walking meditation]], [[yoga]] and [[asana]], [[mudra]], [[juggling]], [[poi (juggling)]], etc.

[[Sufism]] (the [[mystical]] branch of [[Islam]]) has [[theoretical]] and [[metaphoric]] [[writing|texts]] regarding [[religious ecstasy|ecstasy]] as a state of connection with [[Allah]]. [[Sufi]] practice [[rituals]] (''[[dhikr]]'', ''[[sema]]'') use body movement and music to achieve the state.

==Types and varieties==
* ''[[Maenads]]'' and ''[[Bacchae]]'': in [[Greek mythology]], ''Maenads'' were female [[worshipper]]s of [[Dionysus]], the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] god of [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery]], [[wine]] and [[substance intoxication|intoxication]], and the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] god [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. The word literally translates as "raving ones". They were known as wild, insane women who could not be reasoned with. The mysteries of Dionysus inspired the women to [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] frenzy; they indulged in copious amounts of violence, bloodletting, sexual activity, self-intoxication, and mutilation. They were usually pictured as crowned with [[vine]] leaves, clothed in [[deer|fawnskins]] and carrying the [[thyrsus]], and dancing with wild abandon. They were also characterized as entranced women, wandering through the forests and hills.&lt;ref&gt;Wiles, David (2000). ''Greek Theatre Performance: An Introduction''. Cambridge University Press. Source: [http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=052164027X]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Maenads'' were also known as ''Bassarids'' (or ''Bacchae'' or ''Bacchantes'') in [[Roman mythology]], after the penchant of the equivalent Roman god, Bacchus, to wear a [[fox]]-skin, a ''bassaris''.
* [[berserker|Norse berserkers]] were said to have often entered battle entrenched in a state of primal rage, biting their shields and howling like wolves. This fanaticism was so powerful that they were known to continue fighting even after having lost limbs or being otherwise deeply wounded.
* ''[[Samādhi]]'': [[yoga]] provides techniques to attain a state of [[religious ecstasy|ecstasy]] called ''samādhi''. According to practitioners, there are various stages of ecstasy, the highest of which is called ''[[Nirvikalpa|Nirvikalpa samādhi]]''. Different traditions have different understanding of ''Samādhi''.
* ''[[Bhakti]]'': ([[Devanāgarī]]: भक्ति) is a word of Sanskrit origin meaning "devotion" and also "the path of devotion" itself, as in ''[[Bhakti yoga|Bhakti-yoga]]''. Within [[Hinduism]] the word is used exclusively to denote devotion to a particular [[deity]] or form of [[God]]. Within [[Vaishnavism]] ''bhakti'' is only used in conjunction with [[Vishnu]] or one of his associated [[incarnation]]s, it is likewise used towards [[Shiva]] by followers of [[Shaivism]]. Saints in these traditions exhibit different trance states or ecstasy.
* ''[[Agape]]'' or "Divine Love": the term ''agape'' appears in the ''[[Odyssey]]'' twice, where the word describes something that creates contentedness within the speaker.
* Communion: In the [[monotheistic]] [[tradition]], [[religious ecstasy]] is usually associated with communion and [[henosis|oneness]] with [[God]]. Indeed, ecstasy is the primary vehicle for the type of [[prophetic]] [[hallucination|visions]] and [[revelation]]s found in the [[Bible]]. However, such experiences can also be personal [[mystical]] experiences with no significance to anyone but the person experiencing them.
* [[Rapture]] or [[religious ecstasy]]: is an [[altered state of consciousness]] characterized by greatly reduced external [[awareness]] and expanded interior mental and spiritual awareness which is frequently accompanied by [[hallucination|visions]] and emotional/intuitive (and sometimes physical) [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]]. Although the experience is usually brief in physical time, there are records of such experiences lasting several days or even more, and of recurring experiences of ecstasy during one's lifetime. [[Subjectivity|Subjective]] [[perception]] of [[time]], [[space]] and/or [[self (philosophy)|self]] may strongly change or disappear during ecstasy.
* [[Peak experiences]]: is a term developed by [[Abraham Maslow]] and used to describe certain extra-personal and [[ecstatic states]], particularly ones tinged with themes of unification, [[harmonization]] and [[Oneness (metaphysics)|interconnectedness]]. Participants characterize these experiences, and the revelations imparted therein, as possessing an ineffably [[mystical]] (or overtly [[religious]]) quality or essence.
* In [[Christianity]], the ecstatic experiences of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] are recorded in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 10:10, 11:5 and 22:17.
* Some [[Charismatic movement|charismatic Christians]] practice ecstatic states (called, e.g., "being [[slain in the Spirit]]") and interpret these as given by the [[Holy Spirit]].
* In [[hagiography]] (writings on the subject of Christian [[saint]]s) many instances are recorded in which saints are granted ecstasies. According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05277a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Ecstasy|work=newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; religious ecstasy (called ''supernatural ecstasy'') includes two elements: one, interior and invisible, in which the mind rivets its attention on a religious subject, and another, corporeal and visible, in which the activity of the senses is suspended, reducing the effect of external sensations upon the subject and rendering him or her resistant to awakening.
* Trance states have also long been used by [[shamans]], [[mysticism|mystics]], and [[fakirs]] in [[healing]] [[rituals]], being particularly cultivated in some [[religions]], such as [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Australian shamanism has been observed&lt;ref&gt;Lawlor (1991: p.&amp;nbsp;374) states that:
"The supernormal, super sensory powers of Aboriginal wise woman and men of high degree, by their own accounts, comes directly from initiations administered by the ancestral sky heroes themselves and by the totemic spirits. Those who have gone through these initiations alone, in a deep trance that makes them lose their personal identities and confront manifestations of the ancestral powers, are held in the highest regard."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawlor (1991: p.&amp;nbsp;303) states that: "One such animal dance ceremony was observed and photographed by Gillen and Spencer. More than 30 naked men gathered in a large circle. One by one, each man performed the dance of the animal to be hunted while the others sang and slapped their buttocks to create a percussive beat for the dancer. The slapping sound was so loud that it could be heard for miles across the surrounding desert. The dance continued for hours, with each man dancing frenetically until he dropped from exhaustion. The eyes of the onlookers soon became glazed with entrancement; their penises were erect in a state of ecstatic arousal. Finally, after the last man had performed the animal dance and collapsed in exhaustion, the entire group leaped on him, emitting a loud abandoned cry. The next day the hunt began."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divination==
[[Divination]] is a cultural universal which [[anthropologists]] have observed as being present in many [[religions]] and [[cultures]] in all ages up to the present day (see [[sibyl]]). {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Divination may be defined as a mechanism for [[fortune-telling]] by ascertaining information by interpretation of [[omens]] or an alleged supernatural agency. Divination often entails [[ritual]], and is often facilitated by trance.

===Nechung Oracle===
In [[Tibet]], [[oracle]]s have played, and continue to play, an important part in [[religion]] and [[government]]. The word ''oracle'' is used by Tibetans to refer to the [[spirit]], [[deity]] or [[entity]] that enters those men and women who act as [[mediumship|media]] between the natural and the spiritual realms. The media are, therefore, known as ''kuten'', which literally means, "the physical basis".

The [[Dalai Lama]], who lives in exile in northern India, still consults an oracle known as the ''[[Nechung Oracle]]'', which is considered the official state oracle of the government of Tibet. He gives a complete description of the process of trance and possession in his book ''Freedom in Exile''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tibet.com/Buddhism/nechung_hh.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205234136/http://www.tibet.com/Buddhism/nechung_hh.html |archivedate=5 December 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific disciplines==
Convergent disciplines of [[neuroanthropology]], [[ethnomusicology]], [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), [[neurotheology]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]], amongst others, are conducting research into the trance induction of [[altered states of consciousness]] resulting from [[brainwave entrainment|neuron entrainment]] with the driving of sensory modalities, for example [[polyharmonics]], [[multiphonics]], and [[percussive]] [[polyrhythms]] through the channel of the auditory and [[kinesthetic]] [[Modality (semiotics)|modality]].

[[Neuroanthropology]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]] are conducting research into the trance induction of [[altered states of consciousness]] (possibly engendering [[higher consciousness]]) resulting from [[neuron]] firing [[Brainwave entrainment|entrainment]] with these [[polyharmonics]] and [[multiphonics]]. Related research has been conducted into neural entraining with [[percussive]] [[polyrhythms]]. The [[timbre]] of traditional singing bowls and their [[polyrhythms]] and [[multiphonics]] are considered meditative and calming, and the harmony inducing effects of this [[tool]] to potentially alter consciousness are being explored by scientists, medical professionals and therapists.

==Brainwaves and brain rhythms==

{{see also|Neural oscillation}}

Scientific advancement and new technologies such as computerized [[EEG]], [[positron emission tomography]], regional cerebral blood flow, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, are providing measurable tools to assist in understanding trance phenomena.

Though a source of contention, there appear to be three current streams of inquiry: [[neurophysiology]], [[social psychology]] and [[cognitive behaviorism]]. The [[neurophysiological]] approach is awaiting the development of a mechanism to map physiological measurements to human thought. The social-psychological approach currently measures gross subjective and social effects of thoughts and some critique it for lack of precision. Cognitive behaviorialists employ [[systems theory]] concepts and analytical techniques.

There are four principal brainwave states that range from high-amplitude, low-frequency delta to low-amplitude, high-frequency beta. These states range from deep dreamless sleep to a state of high arousal. These four brainwave states are common throughout humans. All levels of brainwaves exist in everyone at all times, even though one is foregrounded depending on the activity level. When a person is in an aroused state and exhibiting a beta brainwave pattern, their brain also exhibits a component of alpha, theta and delta, even though only a trace may be present.

The University of Philadelphia study on some Christians at the Freedom Valley Worship Center in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]], revealed that [[glossolalia]]-speaking (vocalizing or praying in unrecognizable form of language which is seen in members of certain Christian sects) activates areas of the brain out of voluntary control. In addition, the [[frontal lobe]] of the brain, which monitors speech, significantly diminished in activity as the study participants spoke glossolalia. Dr. [[Andrew B. Newberg]], in analysis of his earlier studies as opposed to the [[MRI scans]] of the test subjects, stated that Buddhist monks in meditation and Franciscan nuns in prayer exhibited increased activity in the frontal lobe, and subsequently their behaviors, very much under voluntary control. The investigation found this particular beyond-body-control characteristic only in tongue-speakers (also see [[xenoglossia]]).

'''''Virtus''''' was a specific [[virtue]] in [[Ancient Rome]].  It carries connotations of valor, manliness, excellence, courage, character, and worth, perceived as masculine strengths (from [[Latin]] ''vir'', "man"). It was thus a frequently stated virtue of [[Roman emperors]], and was personified as a deity—[[Virtus (god)|Virtus]].

== Origins ==

The origins of the word ''virtus'' can be traced back to the Latin word ''vir'', "man".  The common list of attributes associated with ''virtus'' are typically perceived masculine strengths, which may indicate its derivation from ''vir''. From the early to the later days of the Roman Empire, there appears to have been a development in how the concept was understood. 

Originally ''virtus'' was used to describe specifically martial courage, but it eventually grew to be used to describe a range of Roman virtues. It was often divided into different qualities including ''prudentia'' ([[prudence]]), ''iustitia'' ([[justice (virtue)|justice]]), ''[[temperantia]]'' ([[temperance (virtue)|temperance]], self-control), and ''fortitudo'' ([[courage]]). This division of virtue as a whole into [[cardinal virtues]] is today classified as [[virtue ethics]], as described by [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic]]'' and [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. It implies a link between ''virtus'' and the Greek concept of ''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]''.

This inclusion leads to the belief that at one time ''virtus'' extended to cover a wide range of meanings that covered one general ethical ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of the word began to grow and shift to fit the new idea of what manliness meant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;
No longer did ''virtus'' mean that a person was a brave warrior but it could also mean that he was a good man, someone who did the right thing.  During the time of the decline of the Roman elite ''virtus'' the Roman upper class no longer thought of themselves as unmanly if they did not serve in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtue as described by Aristotle was rediscovered in the medieval age by [[Muslim]] philosopher [[Averroes]], which in turn influenced [[Thomas Aquinas]] to fuse virtue and ethics with Christianity in connection with the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]].

== In Roman political philosophy ==

''Virtus'' comes from the aristocratic tradition in which it is a specific type of public conduct. It is really only applicable in the ''[[cursus honorum]]'', certainly by the late republic at least. It is not a "private" virtue in the way that modern people might consider it. Valor, courage, and manliness are not things that can be pursued in the private sphere of the individual or the individual's private concerns. There could be no virtue in exploiting one's manliness in the pursuit of personal wealth, for example. ''Virtus'' is exercised in the pursuit of ''gloria'' for the benefit of the ''[[res publica]]'' resulting in the winning of eternal "memoria". According to D.C. Earl "Outside the service of the ''res publica'' there can be no ''magistratus'' and therefore, strictly speaking, no ''gloria'', no ''nobilitas'', no ''virtus''".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Earl|1966|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the nobility ''virtus'' lies not only in one's personal "acta" but also that of one's ancestors. However Cicero, a ''[[novus homo]]'', asserted that ''virtus'' was a virtue particularly suited to the new man just as nobilitas was suited to the noble.  Cicero argued that just as young men from noble families won the favor of the people so too should the novus homo earn the favor of the people with his ''virtus''. He even extended the argument that ''virtus'' and not one’s family history should decide a man’s worthiness. ''Virtus'' is something that a man earns himself, not something that is given to him by his family, thus it is a better measure of a man’s ability.  Cicero's goal was not to impugn the noble class but widen it to include men who had earned their positions by merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Earl|1966|pp=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was used quite significantly by the historian [[Sallust]], a contemporary of Cicero. Sallust asserted that it did not rightfully belong to the ''nobilitas'' as a result of their family background but specifically to the ''[[novus homo]]'' through the exercise of ''ingenium'' (talent). For Sallust and Cicero alike, ''virtus'' is situated in the winning of glory by the execution of illustrious deeds (''egregia facinora'') and the observance of right conduct through ''bonae artes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Earl|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Who could have it ==

''Virtus'' was not universally applicable to just anyone – generally (although not always exclusively) only adult male Roman citizens would be thought of as possessing ''virtus''.

=== Women ===
''Virtus''  was rarely attributed to women, likely because of its association with ''vir''.  The highest regarded female virtue was ''pudicitia'': "modesty" or "chastity".  [[Cicero]], however, attributes this characteristic to females several times. He uses it once to describe Caecilia Metella when she helps a man who is being chased by assassins.{{refn|group=Note|There were several women called [[Caecilia Metella]]. Freese identifies her as the daughter of [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=255 |author=Cicero |title=Pro Quinctio. Pro Roscio Amerino. Pro Roscio Comoedo. On the Agrarian Law. |others=Translated by J. H. Freese. Loeb Classical Library 240. |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balearicus had two daughters of that name. [[Caecilia Metella Balearica (priestess)|The elder]] was a [[Vestal Virgin]] and a priestess of [[Juno Sospita]]. [[Caecilia Metella Balearica|The younger]] was the wife of [[Appius Claudius Pulcher (consul 79 BC)|Appius Claudius Pulcher]]. Kaplan says that the Caecilia Metella who sheltered Roscius was "very probably [...] also a priestess of Juno Sospita".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sulla's 'Watergate' |first=Arthur |last=Kaplan |journal=The Classical Outlook |year=1976 |page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyck identifies her as the wife of Pulcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cicero: 'Pro Sexto Roscio' |author=Cicero |editor-first=Andrew R. |editor-last=Dyck |page=96 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=7 June 2010 |isbn=978-0521882248}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brill's New Pauly]] says that she was the wife of Pulcher, but has no entry for her elder sister. The identification is in doubt, and is likely to remain so.}} Twice more he uses it when describing his daughter, [[Tullia (daughter of Cicero)|Tullia]], portraying her in his letters as brave in his absence.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero: ''Fam'' 14.11 and ''Att.'' 10.8&lt;/ref&gt;  He uses it again to describe his first wife [[Terentia]] during his exile.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero: ''Fam'' 14.1&lt;/ref&gt;
Livy in Book 2 attributes it to Cloelia.

=== Children ===
''Virtus'' was not a term commonly used to describe children.  Since ''virtus'' was primarily attributed to a full grown man who had served in the military, children were not particularly suited to obtain this particular virtue.

=== Slaves ===
While a [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slave]] was able to be ''homo'' ("man") he was not considered a ''vir''. Slaves were often referred to as ''puer'' (Latin for ''boy'') to denote that they were not citizens.&lt;ref name="Myles McDonnell p.160"&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since a slave could not be a ''vir'' it follows that they would not be allowed to have the quality of ''virtus''. Once a slave was manumitted he was able to become a ''vir'' and he was also classified as a freedman but this did not allow him to have ''virtus''.  A good slave or freedman was said to have ''fides'', but no ''virtus''.&lt;ref name="Myles McDonnell p.160"/&gt;

=== Foreigners ===
[[Peregrinus (Roman)|Foreigners]] in the Roman world could be attributed with ''virtus'':  If they fought bravely they could be said to have ''virtus''.  ''Virtus'' could also be lost in battle.  ''Virtus'' could even be a cause to gain citizenship as in the case of Spanish cavalry men granted citizenship by Cn. Pompeius Strabo in 89 BC for their ''virtus'' in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|pp=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How was it used ==
''Virtus'' applies exclusively to a man's behaviour in the public sphere, i.e. to the application of duty to the ''[[res publica]]'' in the ''[[cursus honorum]]''. His private business was no place to earn ''virtus'', even when it involved courage or feats of arms or other qualities associated to it if performed for the public good.

=== In private ===
While in many cultures around the world it is considered "manly" to father and provide for a family, family life was considered in the Roman world to be part of the private sphere.  During this time there was no place for ''virtus'' in the private sphere.  Most uses of ''virtus'' to describe any part of private life are ambiguous and often refer to another similar quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|pp=168–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Roman world the oldest living patriarch of the family was called the ''[[pater familias]]'' and this title implied that he was able to make all legal and binding decisions for the family; he also owned all the money, land, and other property.  His wife, daughters, sons, and his sons’ families were all under his ''[[potestas]]''.  The only time a son was seen as separate from his father's control in the eyes of other Romans was when he assumed his public identity as a citizen. He could earn his ''virtus'' by serving in the military, and thus could only demonstrate manliness outside of the family setting. This is another reason that ''virtus'' is not often used to describe the Roman private life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In public ===
''Virtus'' was a crucial component for a political career. Its broad definition led to it being used to describe a number of qualities that the Roman people idealized in their leaders.

In everyday life a typical Roman, especially a young boy, would have been inculcated with the idea of ''virtus''.  Since military service was a part of most Roman men's life, military training would have started fairly early. Young boys would have learned how to wield weapons and military tactics starting at home with their fathers and older male relatives and later in school.  Also as a young boy one would have heard numerous stories about past heroes, battles, and wars.  Some of these stories would have surely told of the ''virtus'' of past heroes, and even family members.  Publicly it was easy to see the rewards of ''virtus''.  Public triumphs were held for victorious generals and rewards were given to brave fighters.  All of this propaganda would have encouraged young boys coming into their manhood to be brave fighters and earn the attribute of ''virtus''.  It was the duty of every generation of men to maintain the ''[[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignitas]]'' which his family had already earned and enlarge it.  This pressure to live up to the standards of one’s ancestors was great.  In achieving ''virtus'' one could achieve ''[[Glory (religion)|gloria]]''.  By gaining ''virtus'' and ''gloria'' one could hope to aspire to high political office and great renown.

While young boys were encouraged to earn ''virtus'' there were also limits put on showing ''virtus'' in public.{{or|date=July 2012}} ''Virtus'' was often associated with being aggressive{{cn|date=July 2012}} and this could be very dangerous in the public sphere and the political world.  Displays of violent ''virtus'' were controlled through several methods.  Men seeking to hold political office typically had to follow the ''[[cursus honorum]]''.  Many political offices had an age minimum which ensured that the men filling the positions had the proper amount of experience in the military and in government.  This meant that even if a man proved himself capable of filling a position or was able to persuade people that he was capable, he would not necessarily be able to hold the position until he had reached a certain age. This also served to ensure that in elections of public offices no one had a certain advantage over another person because by the time most men went into public office they would have retired from military service. Furthermore, before any Roman soldier could partake in single combat he had to gain permission from his general. This procedure was meant to keep soldiers from putting themselves in extremely dangerous situations that they may or may not have been able to handle in order gain ''virtus''.

The concept of ''virtus'' also tended to be a concept of morality as far as politics were concerned.  This could range from the very literal definition of manliness seen in aggression and the ruthless acquisition of money, land, and power, or the lighter, more idealistic political meaning which almost took on the extended meaning of "pietas", a man who was morally upright and concerned with the matters of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Earl|1967|pp=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plautus in ''[[Amphitruo]]'' contrasted ''virtus'' and ''ambitio''.  Virtus is seen as a positive attribute, though ''ambitio'' itself is not necessarily a negative attribute but is often associated with negative methods such as bribery.  [[Plautus]] said that just as great generals and armies win victory by ''virtus'', so should political candidates.  ''Ambitio'' “is the wrong method of reaching a good end.”  Part of ''virtus'', in the political sphere was to deal justly in every aspect of one’s life, especially in political and state matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Earl|1967|pp=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Military ====

Although the two concepts are related, ''virtus'', for the Roman, did not necessarily emphasize the behavior that the associations of the present-day English term 'virtue' suggest. ''Virtus'' was to be found in the context of 'outstanding deeds' (''egregia facinora''), and brave deeds were the accomplishments which brought ''gloria'' ('a reputation'). This ''gloria'' was attached to two ideas: ''fama'' ('what people think of you') and ''dignitas'' ('one's standing in the community'). The struggle for ''virtus'' in Rome was above all a struggle for public office (''honos''), since it was through aspiring to high office, to which one was elected by the People, that a man could best show his manliness by means of military achievement which would in turn cultivate a reputation and votes. It was the duty of every aristocrat and would-be aristocrat to maintain the ''dignitas'' which his family had already achieved and to extend it to the greatest possible degree, through higher political office and military victories. This system resulted in a strong built-in impetus in Roman society to engage in military expansion and conquest at all times.

=== Sexuality ===
While in many cultures the virtue of manliness is also seen as being partly sexual, in the Roman world ''virtus'' apparently did not have sexual connotations.  Similar words deriving from the same stem often have sexual connotations.  In the Roman world ''virtus'' dealt with a great many areas such as martial courage, honor, and being morally upright rather than sexual manliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|pp=165–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

One of the most well known demonstrations of ''virtus'' was shown by [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus]].  Before Cincinnatus was appointed dictator in 458 BC, Rome was in the midst of a battle with the [[Aequi]] and needed someone to take control. Messengers sent to fetch him found him plowing in his field.  Upon being informed of the appointment, he wept saying, "So my field will be unsown this year, and we shall be in danger of not having enough food to support us."&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius: ''Roman Antiquities'' 10.17.5&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, he dutifully gathered his things, kissed his wife goodbye and departed to raise an army and defeat the Aequi in a mere fifteen days. Upon returning home after the victory, Cincinnatus picked up the plough from where he left it and began plowing again.  [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] recounts this story to illustrate the type of leaders the men of Rome were. He says that they “worked with their hands, led self-disciplined lives, did not complain about honorable poverty, and far from pursuing positions of royal power.”&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius: ''Roman Antiquities'' 10.17.6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pompey]] is another prominent example of ''virtus''.  In 55 BC, Pompey inaugurated his grand theatre complex and dedicated several shrines to different gods, one of these being ''Virtus''.  This consecrated Pompey’s link with ''virtus''.  He gained a reputation with the public as being a man of ''virtus''.  Cicero, throughout his speech, the ''De imperio Cn. Pompei'', connects Pompey with ''"divina virtus"''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero; ''De imperio Cn. Pompei''&lt;/ref&gt;  Pompey was so closely connected with ''virtus'' that once during a production of a play at the ''[[Ludi Apollinares]]'' one of the characters spoofed Pompey by stating ''"eandem virtutem istam veniet tempus cum graviter gemes"'': "The time will come when you bitterly resent that same ''virtus''".  The audience did not need to hear his name to know that Pompey was being referenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marcellus and the Temple===
[[M. Claudius Marcellus]], during the battle of [[Clastidium]] in 222 BC, dedicated a temple to [[Honos]] and Virtus.  This was one of the first times that ''Virtus'' had been recognized as divine. The connection with ''Honos'' would have been obvious to most Romans as demonstrations of ''virtus'' led to election to public office and both were considered ''honos''.  The cult of ''Honos'' was already a long-standing tradition in Rome. The marriage of the two deities ensured that ''Virtus'' would also get proper respect from the Romans. But an objection by the pontiffs was that one temple could not properly house two gods because there would be no way of knowing which god to sacrifice to should a miracle happen in the temple.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Augustus===

During the reign of [[Augustus]], the [[Senate]] voted that a golden shield be inscribed with Augustus’ attributes and displayed in the [[Curia Iulia]], including ''virtus'', ''[[clementia]]'', ''[[iustitia]]'', and ''[[pietas]]''. These political catchwords continued to be used as propaganda by later emperors.

=== In literature ===

The comic poet Plautus made use of the concept of ''virtus'' in his play ''Trinummus'' which concerned family ''virtus'', honor and public office, and obligations to the state. He also offered commentary on the concept of ''virtus'' in ''Amphitruo'' (see above "Virtus and the Public").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Earl|1967|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''VisSim''' is a visual [[block diagram]] program for simulation of [[dynamical system]]s and [[model based design]] of [[embedded systems]], with its own [[vsual programming language|visual language]]. It is developed by Visual Solutions of [[Westford, Massachusetts]]. Visual Solutions, has been acquired by [[Altair Engineering|Altair]] in August 2015 and its products have been rebranded as solidThinking Embed as a part of [[solidThinking]]'s Model Based Development Suite. With solidThinking Embed, you can develop virtual prototypes of dynamic systems. Models are built by sliding blocks into the work area and wiring them together with the mouse. Embed automatically converts the control diagrams into C-code ready to be downloaded to the target hardware.

VisSim or now solidThinking Embed uses a graphical data flow paradigm to implement dynamic systems based on differential equations. Version 8 adds interactive [[UML state machine|UML]] [[Object Management Group|OMG]] 2 compliant [[State diagram|state chart graphs]] that are placed in VisSim diagrams. This allows the modeling of state based systems such as startup sequencing of process plants or serial protocol decoding.

==Applications==
VisSim/solidThinking Embed is used in [[control system]] design and [[digital signal processing]] for multidomain simulation and design.&lt;ref name=References&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?q=VisSim+Visual+Solutions Books on wide variety of technical subjects referencing VisSim] on the [[Google Books Library Project]]&lt;/ref&gt; It includes blocks for arithmetic, Boolean, and [[transcendental function]]s, as well as [[digital filter]]s, [[transfer function]]s, [[numerical integration]] and interactive plotting.&lt;ref name=userguide&gt;''Visual simulation with student VisSim'', by Karen Darnell, 1996, PWS Pub. Co., Boston, {{ISBN|0-534-95485-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly modeled systems are aeronautical, biological/medical, digital power, electric motor, electrical, hydraulic, mechanical, process, thermal/HVAC and econometric.&lt;ref name=References /&gt;

===Distributing VisSim models===
[[File:VisSim screenshot.PNG|left|thumb|VisSim viewer screenshot with sample model.]]
A read-only version of the software, [http://www.vissim.com/downloads/demos.html VisSim Viewer], is available free of charge and provides a way for people not licensed to use VisSim to run VisSim models.&lt;ref name=Viewer&gt;[http://vissim.com/products/vissim_viewer.html Viewer page] on company website&lt;/ref&gt; This program is intended to allow models to be more widely shared while preserving the model in its published form.&lt;ref name=Viewer /&gt; The viewer will execute any VisSim model, and only allows changes to block and simulation parameters to illustrate different design scenarios. Sliders and buttons may be activated if included in the model.

==Code generation==
The "VisSim/C-Code" add-on generates [[ANSI C]] code for the model, and generates target specific code for on-chip devices like PWM, ADC, encoder, GPIO, I2C etc. This is useful for development of [[embedded systems]]. After the behavior of the controller has been simulated, C-code can be generated, compiled and run on the target. For debugging, VisSim supports an interactive JTAG linkage, called "Hotlink", that allows interactive gain change and plotting of on-target variables. The VisSim generated code has been called efficient and readable, making it well suited for development of embedded systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akademik.unsri.ac.id/download/journal/files/waset/v47-35.pdf Graphical Environment for Modeling Control Systems in Full Scope Training Simulators]&lt;/ref&gt; VisSim's author served on the X3J11 ANSI C committee and wrote several C compilers, in addition to co-authoring a book on C.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Peter+A.+Darnell&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;lr= Books on C by Peter A. Darnell and Philip E. Margolis]&lt;/ref&gt; This deep understanding of ANSI C, and the nature of the resulting [[machine code]] when compiled, is the key to the code generator's efficiency. VisSim can target small [[16-bit]] [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed point]] systems like the [[Texas Instruments]] [[MSP430]], using only 740 bytes flash and 64 bytes of RAM for a small closed-loop [[Pulse-width modulation]] (PWM) actuated system, as well as allowing very high control sample rates over 500&amp;nbsp;kHz on larger [[32-bit]] [[floating point processor]]s like the [[Texas Instruments]] 150&amp;nbsp;MHz F28335.

==Use of model-based development==
{{Main article|Model based design}}
The technique of simulating system performance off-line, and then generating code from the simulation is known as "model-based development". Model-based development for [[embedded system]]s is becoming widely adopted for production systems because it shortens development cycles for hardware development in the same way that [[Model-driven architecture]] shortens production cycles for software development.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LGzS1uiUa7AC Principles of model-driven architecture], Stephen J. Mellor, Addison-Wesley, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Model building]] is a visual way of describing a situation. In an engineering context, instead of writing and solving a [[system of equations]], model building involves using visual "blocks" to solve the problem. The advantage of using models is that in some cases problems which appear difficult if expressed mathematically may be easier to understand when represented pictorially.

VisSim uses a hierarchical composition to create nested block diagrams. A typical model would consist of "virtual plants" composed of various VisSim "layers", combined if necessary with custom blocks written in C or FORTRAN. A virtual controller can be added and tuned to give desired overall system response. [[Graphical control element (software)|Graphical control element]] such as sliders and buttons allow control of [[what-if analysis]] for operator training or controller tuning.

Although VisSim was originally designed for use by [[control engineer]]s, it can be used for any type of mathematical model.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17030">'''Writing assessment''' refers to an area of study that contains theories and practices that guide the evaluation of a writer's performance or potential through a writing task. Writing assessment can be considered a combination of scholarship from [[composition studies]] and measurement theory within [[educational assessment]].&lt;ref&gt;Behizadeh, Nadia and George Engelhard Jr. "Historical View of the influences of measurement and writing theories on the practice of writing assessment in the United States" ''Assessing Writing'' 16 (2011) 189-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing assessment can also refer to the [[technologies]] and practices used to evaluate student writing and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Huot, B. &amp; Neal, M. (2006). Writing assessment: A techno-history. In C. A. MacArthur, S. Graham, &amp; J. Fitzgerald (Eds.), Handbook of Writing Research (pp. 417-432). New York, NY: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contexts==

Writing assessment began as a classroom practice during the first two decades of the 20th century, though [[High-stakes testing|high-stakes]] and [[Standardized testing|standardized tests]] also emerged during this time.&lt;ref name="BehizadehNadia"&gt;Behizadeh, Nadia and George Engelhard Jr. "Historical View of the influences of measurement and writing theories on the practice of writing assessment in the United States" ''Assessing Writing'' 16 (2011) 189-211&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s, [[College Board]] shifted from using direct writing assessment to indirect assessment because these tests were more cost-effective and were believed to be more reliable.&lt;ref name="BehizadehNadia" /&gt; Starting in the 1950s, more students from diverse backgrounds were attending colleges and universities, so administrators made use of standardized testing to decide where these students should be placed, what and how to teach them, and how to measure that they learned what they needed to learn.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen"&gt;Yancey, Kathleen Blake. "Looking Back as We Look Forward: Historicizing Writing Assessment as a Rhetorical Act." ''College Composition and Communication''. 50.3 (1999): 483-503. Web. 23 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The large-scale statewide writing assessments that developed during this time combined direct writing assessment with [[Multiple choice|multiple-choice]] items, a practice that remains dominant today across U.S. large scale testing programs, such as the [[SAT]] and [[GRE]].&lt;ref name="BehizadehNadia" /&gt; These assessments usually take place outside of the classroom, at the state and national level. However, as more and more students were placed into courses based on their standardized testing scores, writing teachers began to notice a conflict between what students were being tested on—[[grammar]], [[usage]], and [[vocabulary]]—and what the teachers were actually teaching—[[writing process]] and revision.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen" /&gt; Because of this divide, educators began pushing for writing assessments that were designed and implemented at the local, programmatic and classroom levels.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huot, Brian. ''(Re)Articulating Writing Assessment for Teaching and Learning.'' Logan, Utah: Utah State UP, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; As writing teachers began designing local assessments, the methods of assessment began to diversify, resulting in timed essay tests, locally designed rubrics, and portfolios. In addition to the classroom and programmatic levels, writing assessment is also hugely influential on [[Writing center|writing centers]] for [[writing center assessment]], and similar academic support centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = When Hard Questions Are Asked: Evaluating Writing Centers.|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED416479|language = en|first = James H.|last = Bell|journal = The Writing Center Journal|volume = 21.1|pages = 7–28|date = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Because writing assessment is used in multiple [[Context (language use)|contexts]], the history of writing assessment can be traced through examining specific concepts and [[rhetorical situation|situation]]s that prompt major shifts in theories and practices. Writing assessment [[scholars]] do not always agree about the origin of writing assessment.

In "Looking Back as We Look Forward: Historicizing Writing Assessment as a Rhetorical Act," [[Kathleen Blake Yancey]] offers a history of writing assessment by tracing three major shifts in [[Methodology|methods]] used in assessing writing.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen" /&gt; She describes the three major shifts through the [[metaphor]] of overlapping [[wave|waves]]: "with one wave feeding into another but without completely displacing waves that came before". In other words, the theories and practices from each wave are still present in some current contexts, but each wave marks the prominent theories and practices of the time.

The first wave of writing assessment (1950-1970) sought [[objective test]]s with indirect measures of assessment. The second wave (1970-1986) focused on [[holistic grading|holistically scored tests]] where the students' actual writing began to be assessed. And the third wave (since 1986) shifted toward assessing a collection of student work (i.e. portfolio assessment) and programmatic assessment.

Bob Broad in ''What We Really Value''&lt;ref&gt;Broad, Bob. ''What we Really Value: Beyond Rubrics in Teaching and Assessing Writing''. Logan, UT: Utah State University Press, 2003. Print&lt;/ref&gt; points to the publication of ''Factors in Judgments of Writing Ability'' in 1961 by Diederich, French, and Carlton as the birth of modern writing assessment. Diederich, French, and Carlton based much of their book on research conducted through the [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS) for the previous decade. This book is an attempt to [[standardization|standardize]] the assessment of writing and, according to Broad, created a base of research in writing assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Diederich, P.G.; French, J. W.; Carlton, S. T. (1961) ''Factors in Judgments of Writing Ability. Princeton, NJ: Educational Testing Service&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major concepts==

===Validity and reliability===
Yancey traces the major shifts in writing assessment by pointing toward each wave's swing toward or away from the concepts of [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and [[reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]].&lt;ref&gt;Yancey, Kathleen Blake. "Looking Back as We Look Forward"&lt;/ref&gt; Peggy O'Neill, Cindy Moore, and Brian Huot explain in ''A Guide To College Writing Assessment'' that reliability and validity are the most important terms in discussing best practices in writing assessment.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Peggy, Cindy Moore, and Brian Huot. A Guide to College Writing Assessment. Logan, UT: Utah State University Press, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first wave of writing assessment, the emphasis is on [[reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]]:&lt;ref&gt;Yancey, Kathleen Blake. "Looking back as We Look Forward"&lt;/ref&gt; reliability confronts questions over the consistency of a test. In this wave, the central concern was to assess writing with the best predictability with the least amount of cost and work.

The shift toward the second wave marked a move toward considering principles of [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. Validity confronts questions over a test's appropriateness and effectiveness for the given purpose. Methods in this wave were more concerned with a test's [[construct validity]]: whether the material prompted from a test is an appropriate measure of what the test purports to measure. Teachers began to see an incongruence between the material being prompted to measure writing and the material teachers were asking students to write. [[holistic grading|Holistic scoring]], championed by Edward M. White, emerged in this wave. It is one method of assessment where students' writing is prompted to measure their writing ability.&lt;ref&gt;"Holisticism." ''College Composition and Communication,'' 35 (December, 1984): 400-409.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third wave of writing assessment emerges with continued interest in the validity of assessment methods. This wave began to consider an expanded definition of validity that includes how portfolio assessment contributes to learning and teaching. In this wave, portfolio assessment emerges to emphasize theories and practices in [[Composition studies|Composition and Writing Studies]] such as [[revision (writing)|revision]], drafting, and [[writing process|process]].

===Direct and indirect assessment===
Indirect writing assessments typically consist of multiple choice tests on grammar, usage, and vocabulary.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen" /&gt; Examples include [[High stakes testing|high-stakes]] standardized tests such as the [[ACT (test)|ACT]], [[SAT]], and [[GRE]], which are most often used by colleges and universities for [[College admissions|admissions]] purposes. Other indirect assessments, such as Compass and [[Accuplacer#Accuplacer|Accuplacer]], are used to [[Placement testing|place]] students into [[Remedial education|remedial]] or mainstream writing courses. Direct writing assessments, like the timed essay test, require at least one sample of student writing and
are viewed by many writing assessment scholars as more valid than indirect tests because they are assessing actual samples of writing.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen" /&gt; Portfolio assessment, which generally consists of several pieces of student writing written over the course of a semester, began to replace timed essays during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Portfolio assessment is viewed as being even more valid than timed essay tests because it focuses on multiple samples of student writing that have been composed in the authentic context of the classroom. Portfolios enable assessors to examine multiple samples of student writing and multiple drafts of a single essay.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen" /&gt;

==Methods==
Methods of writing assessment vary depending on the context and type of assessment. The following is an incomplete list of writing assessments frequently administered:

===Portfolio===
Portfolio assessment is typically used to assess what students have learned at the end of a course or over a period of several years. Course portfolios consist of multiple samples of student writing and a reflective letter or essay in which students describe their writing and work for the course.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emmons, Kimberly. "Rethinking Genres of Reflection: Student Portfolio Cover Letters and the Narrative of Progress." ''Composition Studies'' 31.1 (2003): 43-62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NealMichael"&gt;Neal, Michael. ''Writing Assessment and the Revolution in Digital Texts and Technologies.'' NY: Teachers College, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, Edward. "The Scoring of Writing Portfolios: Phase 2." ''College Composition and Communication'' 56.4 (2005): 581-599.&lt;/ref&gt; "Showcase portfolios" contain final drafts of student writing, and "process portfolios" contain multiple drafts of each piece of writing.&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen_a"&gt;Yancey, Kathleen. "Postmodernism, Palimpsest, and Portfolios: Theoretical Issues in the Representation of Student Work." ''ePortfolio Performance Support Systems: Constructing, Presenting, and Assessing Portfolios.'' Eds Katherine V. Wills and Rich Rice. Fort Collins, Colorado: WAC Clearinghouse. Web. 16 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Both print and electronic portfolios can be either showcase or process portfolios, though electronic portfolios typically contain [[hyperlink]]s from the [[Reflective writing|reflective essay]] or letter to samples of student work and, sometimes, outside sources.&lt;ref name="NealMichael" /&gt;&lt;ref name="YanceyKathleen_a" /&gt;

===Timed-essay===
[[Test (assessment)#Essay|Timed essay tests]] were developed as an alternative to multiple choice, indirect writing assessments. Timed essay tests are often used to place students into writing courses appropriate for their skill level. These tests are usually [[proctor]]ed, meaning that testing takes place in a specific location in which students are given a prompt to write in response to within a set time limit. The SAT and GRE both contain timed essay portions.

===Rubric===
A [[rubric]] is a [[tool]] used in writing assessment that can be used in several writing contexts. A rubric consists of a set of criteria or descriptions that guides a rater to [[Test score|score]] or [[grading (education)|grade]] a writer. The origins of rubrics can be traced to early attempts in education to [[standardization|standardize]] and scale writing in the early 20th century. Ernest C Noyes argues in November 1912 for a shift toward assessment practices that were more science-based. One of the original scales used in education was developed by Milo B. Hillegas in ''A Scale for the Measurement of Quality in English Composition by Young People''. This scale is commonly referred to as the Hillegas Scale. The Hillegas Scale and other scales used in education were used by administrators to compare the progress of schools.&lt;ref&gt;Turley, Eric D. and Chris Gallagher. "On the 'Uses' of Rubrics: Reframing the Great Rubric Debate" ''The English Journal'' Vol 97. No. 4. (Mar. 2008) pp 87-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Diederich, French, and Carlton from the [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS) publish Factors in Judgments for Writing Ability a rubric compiled from a series of raters whose comments were categorized and condensed into a five-factor rubric:&lt;ref&gt;Diederich, P.G.; French, J. W.; Carlton, S. T. (1961) ''Factors in Judgments of Writing Ability.''&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Ideas'': relevance, clarity, quantity, development, persuasiveness
*''Form'': Organization and analysis
*''Flavor'': style, interest, sincerity
*''Mechanics'': specific errors in [[punctuation]], [[grammar]], etc. 
*''Wording'': choice and arrangement of words

As rubrics began to be used in the classroom, teachers began to advocate for criteria to be negotiated with students to have students stake a claim in the how they would be assessed. Scholars such as Chris Gallagher and Eric Turley,&lt;ref&gt;Turley, Eric D. and Chris Gallagher. "On the 'Uses' of Rubrics: Reframing the Great Rubric Debate"&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Broad,&lt;ref&gt;Broad, Bob. ''What we Really Value: Beyond Rubrics in Teaching and Assessing Writing''&lt;/ref&gt; and Asao Inoue&lt;ref&gt;Inoue, Asao B. "Community-based Assessment Pedagogy." Assessing Writing. 9 (2005): 208-38. Web. 23 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; (among many) have advocated that effective use of rubrics comes from local, contextual, and negotiated criteria.

===Multiple-choice test===
[[Multiple choice|Multiple-choice]] tests contain questions about [[usage]], [[grammar]], and [[vocabulary]]. Standardized tests like the SAT, ACT, and GRE are typically used for college or graduate school admission. Other tests, such as Compass and Accuplacer, are typically used to place students into remedial or mainstream writing courses.

===Automated essay scoring===

[[Automated essay scoring]] (AES) is the use of non-human, computer-assisted assessment practices to rate, score, or grade writing tasks.

==Race==
Some scholars in writing assessment focus their research on the influence of [[race (human classification)|race]] on the performance on writing assessments. Scholarship in race and writing assessment seek to study how categories of race and perceptions of race continues to shape writing assessment outcomes. However, scholars in writing assessment recognize that [[color blindness (race)|racism in the 21st century is no longer explicit]],&lt;ref&gt;Bonilla-Silva, Eduardo. ''Racism Without Racists: Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in the United States''. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; LittleField Publishers, Inc., 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; but point out that writing assessment practices are silently racist. Nicholas Behm and Keith D. Miller in "Challenging the Frameworks of Color-Blind Racism: Why We Need a Fourth Wave of Writing Assessment Scholarship"&lt;ref&gt;Behm, Nicholas, and Keith D. Miller. "Challenging the Frameworks of Color-blind Racism: Why We Need a Fourth Wave of Writing Assessment Scholarship." Race and Writing Assessment. Asao B. Inoue, and Mya Poe, eds. NYC: Peter Lang Publishing, 2012. 127-38. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; advocate for the recognition of another wave after the three that Yancey offers. Behm and Miller advocate for a wave where the intersections of race and writing assessment are brought to the forefront of assessment practices. As the authors explain, [[racism|racial inequalities]] in writing assessment are typically justified with non-racial reasons.
