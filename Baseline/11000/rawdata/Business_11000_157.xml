He was born in [[Gjirokastër]], [[Ottoman Empire]] (today's [[Albania]]).&lt;ref name=Reiter&gt;{{cite book|last=Reiter|first=herausgegeben von Norbert|title=Nationalbewegungen auf dem Balkan|year=1983|publisher=O.

Basileiou war Kaufmann und stammte aus Argyrokastro (Epiros).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vasileiou was one of many Greek merchants in the 18th-19th centuries that were involved in the fields of education and literature. A. Vasileiou played an essential role in the [[Greek Enlightenment]] movement. His contact with [[Adamantios Korais]], a major figure of Greek literature at that time, was of unique importance for him, while he lived in [[Paris]].

Correspondence between the two men was continuous. A. Vasileiou adopted the ideas of Korais to the [[Greek language question]] and confronted the conservative scholar [[Neofitos Doukas]]. He was the author of a number of articles in the ''[[Hermes o Logios]]'' magazine (a Greek literary magazine, published in [[Vienna]]). At the same time he supported financially the publication of several issues of Logios Ermis and other literature material.

Because of his trading businesses he lived in several cities throughout Europe: [[Amsterdam]], [[Marseille]], [[Lyon]], Paris, Vienna, [[Trieste]]. In Trieste, he was also consul of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. He died in Trieste in 1818, a few days after declaring bankruptcy. His brother, [[Michael Vasileiou]], was also a notable scholar and merchant living in [[Constantinople]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2245">A '''Back-to-back loan''' is a loan agreement between entities in two countries in which the currencies remain separate but the maturity dates remain fixed. The gross [[interest rate]]s of the loan are separate as well and are set on the basis of the commercial rates in place when the agreement is signed.&lt;ref name=zam&gt;{{cite book|title=Bank contingency financing: risks, rewards, and opportunities|author=Andrew J. Zamora|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aMY44jpYyhkC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=back+to+back+loan+definition&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gBnwS7D3KYOKNabr8McE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=back%20to%20back%20loan%20definition&amp;f=false|year=1990|ISBN=978-0-471-60894-3|pages=74–75|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most back-to-back loans come due within 10 years, due to their inherent risks.&lt;ref name=zam/&gt; Initiated as a way of avoiding currency regulations, the practice had, by the mid-1990s, largely been replaced by [[currency swap]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The handbook of international financial terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xyL2Uw0sc5IC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=back+to+back+loan+currency&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qyDwS7KDJYHCM7nogKkM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=back%20to%20back%20loan%20currency&amp;f=false|author=Peter Moles, Nicholas Terry|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=32|ISBN=978-0-19-828885-5|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One disadvantage of such agreements is asymmetrical liability - absent a specific agreement, when one party defaults on the loan, the other party may still be held responsible for repayment.&lt;ref name=globe&gt;{{cite book|title=Global corporate finance: text and cases|year=2006|author=Suk H. Kim, Seung Hee Kim|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|pages=181–182|ISBN=978-1-4051-1990-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another disadvantage in comparison with currency swaps is that back-to-back loan transactions are customarily recorded on banking institutions' records as liabilities and thereby increase their [[capital requirements|capitalization requirements]], while currency swaps were, during the 2000s, widely exempted from this requirement.&lt;ref name=globe/&gt;

{{For|the later director of Dunnes Stores|Ben Dunne (entrepreneur)}}

'''Ben Dunne''' (1908–14 April 1983) was the founder and chairman of [[Dunnes Stores]].

==Early life==
Dunne was born in the village of [[Rostrevor]] in [[County Down]], [[Ireland]] in 1908 to Barney Dunne, a businessman who later became addicted to alcohol and spent 20 years up to his death in 1949 in the workhouse at Newry.

After leaving school at 14, Dunne worked as a boot boy and kept some sheep. 

==Career==
In 1926, after aborting a plan to emigrate to the United States, Dunne moved to [[Drogheda]] in the newly established [[Irish Free State]] and then worked as an apprentice in Cameron's Drapery store in [[Longford]].  In the mid 1930s he moved on to [[Cork (city)|Cork]] where he worked as a buyer for [[Roches Stores]]. A bust-up in 1944 led to his leaving and setting up his own business [[Dunnes Stores]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dunne and dusted: Tough Irish retail king Ben Dunne survived kidnap by the IRA, battles with rivals, unions and government.|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/dunne-and-dusted-tough-irish-retail-king-ben-dunne-survived-kidnap-by-the-ira-battles-with-rivals-unions-and-government-but-when-he-was-busted-for-coke-in-a-florida-hotel-critics-thought-he-was-finished-they-were-wrong-desmond-murphy-on-the-rise-of-the-house-of-dunne-1563361.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=17 August 2015|date=13 December 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Dunne met his wife, Nora Maloney, while working at [[Debenhams Ireland|Roches Stores]].  They were married for 44 years and had six children, including [[Ben Dunne (entrepreneur)|Ben Dunne]] who went on to work in the family business.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2084">The '''Empire Free Trade Crusade''' was a [[political party]] in the [[United Kingdom]].  It was founded by [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] in July 1929 to press for the [[British Empire]] to become a [[free trade bloc]].

The group was founded to oppose both the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] minority government, elected in [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|1929]], and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] leader [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s [[protectionist]] policies, which they viewed as an insufficient answer to their demands for  "fiscal union of the Empire" (with stiff barriers against goods from rival trade blocs)&lt;ref name="Chisholm1992"&gt;Anne Chisholm and Michael Davie (1992). ''Beaverbrook: A Life''. London, Hutchinson.&lt;/ref&gt;, a more extreme version of [[Imperial Preference]].

Beaverbrook began enrolling members at the end of 1929, after concluding that Baldwin would not be won over to his aim. In 1930, he briefly joined [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]]'s '''United Empire Party''', and the two parties worked together thereafter.

In October 1930, [[Ernest Augustus Taylor|Ernest Taylor]] stood for the party in the [[Paddington South by-election, 1930|Paddington South by-election]], winning a previously safe Conservative seat. A second candidate in the [[Westminster St George's by-election, 1931]] was beaten by the Conservatives. This began a decline for the group, accelerated when Taylor joined the Conservative Party after it won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931 UK general election]]. Beaverbrook maintained the group until the late 1930s, but it did not contest any further elections.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7200">'''Engineer to order''' is a production approach characterized by:&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Wortmann|J.C. Wortmann]], Chapter: "A classification scheme for master production schedule", in Efficiency of Manufacturing Systems, C. Berg, D. French and B. Wilson (eds) New York, Plenum Press 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

#Engineering activities need to be added to product [[lead time]].
#Upon receipt of a customer order, the order engineering requirements and specifications are not known in detail.  There is a substantial amount of design and engineering analysis required.

To speed up delivery time, the adoption of [[concurrent engineering]], [[integrated product team]], and [[lean product development]] methodologies are used.  The critical path methodology is also essential.

Engineer to order environments must employ a flexible and adaptive, demand-driven approach to the manufacturing process. It is usually the right solution when details on a customer order are not provided and engineering development must be added to product lead time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leadtime.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

ETO is a technique that is leveraged to boost sales and improve margins for those companies with customers needing solutions that are tailored to fit their own unique environment. It begins with selling product concepts that don’t have fixed designs and are expected to result in a new, unique end product.  This could be any product, from enterprise software applications to special aircraft to a pair of jeans.  But the typical ETO environment usually deals with the design and build of unique custom engineered complex machinery and industrial equipment - one in which there is heavy involvement of the following engineering disciplines; mechanical, electrical, mechatronics, software, manufacturing and systems engineering.  The ETO company works with its customers to develop new products that satisfy the customer’s requirements and specifications.

==Engineer to order vs Made to Order==

The difference between the ETO approach to production and make to order products is that engineering original products to order includes the entire design process. In MTO companies typically have a fixed design and specifications to start with. The existing design is followed, even if the customer requests some customization of dimensions or materials.  In engineering to meet unique customer orders, designs spring from collaboration with the customer, beginning with a need and a concept. Engineers do not know the final specifications, materials, or in software development, even the network or application platform until other primary concepts are ironed out. This is a much more creative process and requires a much closer relationship with clients, ultimately leading to a product that is unique.

==Process Flow==

Engineers don’t always follow a smooth flow from step to step even in ordinary manufacturing. Most manufacturing design decisions tends to be highly iterative.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.instructionaldesign.org/models/iterative_design.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is common to create a design that meets customer approval, test it, make changes to meet specifications, and resubmit at certain stages or milestones in order for approval to proceed to the next stage.  Engineer to order, due to its nature, is even more complex and client-centric. This requires on-going documentation, but the approach typically involves all of the following steps.

* ''Sales'': A sales order is agreed upon between client and manufacturer. This will include quoted costs, delivery dates, and other basic information like a work breakdown structure (WBS) document. This is assigned to a project as an order item. Costing is usually based on actual costs related to past similar projects. This generally includes consideration of reworks and scrap.
* ''Scale out'': This involves fine tuning for further details, such as project team and management designations, departmental labor/fabrication, re-scheduling, anticipated resources, and release of the WBS to establish and coordinate project activities.
* ''Procurement'': A bill of materials (BOM) covering all elements is created and followed to satisfy initial requirements, as well as ownership of the end product. Work orders for each component are planned in sequence. Many customers will require lot tracking via product sheets; that is, the origin, specification, and batch number of every lot of materials used, in order to effect future reproduction or identify the source of material flaws or an unacceptable quality of finished components.
* ''Design begins'': Research and development begins work on product realization, usually followed by an advance payment before physical product designs begin. A direct link between CAD (computer aided design) and fabrication is made more effective by eliminating the need for ERP (enterprise resource planning) input as a control.
* ''Milestones'': Project milestones are established and applied to the order development to structure a client billing plan. A deposit or down payment is received to launch project development, but may be adjusted in final billing.
* ''Confirmation'': Receipt of payment and approval for go-ahead of lead-time components as each milestone is realized&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.infor.com/help_lawson_10.0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.lawson.help.financials%2Fcom.lawson.help.brug-uwa_10.0.x%2FF_72512x3Ax20H2x3Ax20Whatx20isx20Milestonex20Billingx3F.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''MRP'' (material requirements planning): Planned orders for all required materials and elements are issued across the complete BOM.
* ''Assembly'': Preliminary assembly of components and confirmation of production approval. Typically another advance payment is made.
* ''Delivery'': Delivering of components and final assembly/installation, usually at client location.
* ''Trial period'': After the customer has tested and accepted the product, final payment and contract settlement are made.
* ''Review'': The manufacturer conducts analysis of cost, delivery progress, and revenue through documentation and reports related to the project.

==Quality==
Given the unique nature of the delivered product, clients may accept certain quality risks as a consequence of meeting delivery dates. Testing and trial periods may also be limited by the nature of the product, the manufacturing required, and the metrics established for quality controls.  As each product is essentially a one of a kind prototype, smaller companies on either the manufacturer or client side may not have the expertise or resources to implement use-cases, user testing, or future quality guidelines.  In MTO, quality is often defined as a lack of defects, but must meet minimal levels defined in the specifications. In Engineer to Order there is no original design. Where possible, prior similar products may provide some guidelines as to testing and precision, but the idea of re-designing or modifying an existing design is necessarily a core requirement of the engineer to order concept.  It does however reduce costs and time if one can use previous designs.

A '''eurobond''' is an international [[bond (finance)|bond]] that is denominated in a [[currency]] not native to the country where it is issued. Also called external bond; "external bonds which, strictly, are neither eurobonds nor foreign bonds would also include: foreign currency denominated domestic bonds…"&lt;ref&gt;p. 15 Eurobonds; Michael Bowe. {{ISBN|1-55623-179-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be categorised according to the currency in which it is issued.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; for these instruments. Eurobonds may be traded throughout the world—for example in [[Singapore]] or [[Tokyo]].

Eurobonds are named after the currency they are denominated in. For example, [[Euroyen]] and [[Eurodollar]] bonds are denominated in Japanese [[yen]] and American [[dollars]] respectively.  Eurobonds were originally in [[bearer bond]] form, payable to the bearer and were also free of [[withholding tax]]. The bank paid the holder of the coupon the interest payment due. Usually, no official records were kept. The word eurobond was originally created by Julius Strauss.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The first eurobonds were issued in 1963 by Italian motorway network [[Autostrade of Italy|Autostrade]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.autostrade.it/en/chi-siamo/storia_index.html?initPos=1
|title=History of the Autostrade Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; who issued 60,000 bearer bonds at a value  of US$250 each  for a fifteen-year loan of US$15m, paying an annual coupon of 5.5%. The issue was arranged by London bankers [[S. G. Warburg &amp; Co.|S. G. Warburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Their conception was largely a reaction against the imposition of the [[Interest Equalization Tax]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Subterranean capitalist blues

The majority of Eurobonds are now owned in "electronic" rather than physical form.  The bonds are held and traded within one of the clearing systems ([[Euroclear]] and [[Clearstream]] being the most common). Coupons are paid electronically via the clearing systems to the holder of the eurobond (or their nominee account).

'''Félicien Kabuga''' (born 1935) is a Rwandan businessman, accused of bankrolling and participating in the [[Rwandan genocide]].

==Early life==
Kabuga was born in Muniga, in the [[Commune (administrative division)|commune]] of Mukarange, [[prefecture]] of Byumba, present-day Rwanda. Kabuga amassed his wealth by owning tea farms in northern Rwanda, among other business ventures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpxy4NxqboQ&amp;feature=relmfu|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A multimillionaire,&lt;ref name=Economistfall&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9441341 How the mighty are falling], ''The Economist'', 5 July 2007. Accessed online 17 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; he was closely connected to [[Juvénal Habyarimana]]'s [[Mouvement républicain national pour la démocratie et le développement|MRND]] party and the [[Akazu]], an informal group of Hutu extremists from northern Rwanda that strongly contributed to the Rwandan genocide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Kabuga was also allegedly heavily involved in the founding and bankrolling of [[RTLM]], as well as [[Kangura]] magazine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trialinternational.org/latest-post/felicien-kabuga/|title=Felicien Kabuga - TRIAL International|work=TRIAL International|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, at an RTLM fundraising meeting organised by the MRND, Felicien Kabuga allegedly publicly defined the purpose of RTLM as the defence of [[Hutu Power]].&lt;ref&gt;ICTR Case No. 99-52-T; The Prosecutor against Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, Amended Indictment, pg. 19, 6.4; http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/ICTR/BARAYAGWIZA_ICTR-99-52/Judgment_&amp;_Sentence_ICTR-99-52-T.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[ICTR]]'s so-called "media trial", former RTLM presenter [[Georges Ruggiu]] named Kabuga as the "Chairman Director-general" of the station, with duties such as "presiding over RTLM" and "representing RTLM."&lt;ref&gt;ICTR-99-52-T Prosecution Exhibit P 91B; "A DOCUMENT TITLED RTLM ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE RUGGIUS REPRESENTATION.PDF"&lt;/ref&gt;

From January 1993 to March 1994, a total of 500,000 [[machetes]] were imported into Rwanda, statistically one for every three adult Hutus in the country. Kabuga has been named as one of the main importers of these machetes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meredith, Martin (2006). ''[[The State of Africa]]'', p. 501. Simon &amp; Schuster UK Ltd., London. {{ISBN|978-0-7432-3222-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kabuga is married to Josephine Mukazitoni. Two of their daughters are married to two of Habyarimana's sons.&lt;ref name="unictr.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-chronicles.net/index.php/features/685-where-is-rwandas-most-wanted-fugitive-kabuga.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indictment by ICTR==
On 29 August 1998, the prosecutor of the [[ICTR|United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]], [[Carla Del Ponte]] indicted Kabuga. In the amended indictment dated 1 October 2004, prosecutor [[Hassan Jallow]] charged Kabuga with:
* Conspiracy to commit genocide
* Genocide, or alternatively
* Complicity in genocide
* Direct and public incitement to commit genocide
* Extermination as a crime against humanity.&lt;ref name="unictr.org"/&gt;

==Life as a fugitive==
In June 1994, after Rwanda was conquered by the [[Rwandese Patriotic Front|RPF]], Kabuga fled the country. He first attempted to enter [[Switzerland]], but was ordered to leave. He went to [[Kinshasa]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and was later believed to be residing in [[Nairobi]], Kenya.

In September 1995, before any indictment and before he was named as a suspected planner of the genocide, Kabuga registered and ran a business named 'Nshikabem Agency' in Nairobi, operating out of the Kilimani area located along Nairobi’s Lenana Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Criminal Tribunal For Rwanda: Delayed Justice|url=http://cms.crisisgroup.org/africa/central-africa/rwanda/international-criminal-tribunal-rwanda-delayed-justice|language=en|date=7 June 2001|work=[[International Crisis Group]]|page=16n31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpxy4NxqboQ|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech given on 28 August 2006 during his visit to Kenya, then US Senator [[Barack Obama]] accused Kenya of "allowing him [Kabuga] to purchase safe haven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

According to June 2008 reports by a Norwegian-based blogger calling himself African Press International (API), Kabuga was in hiding in [[Oslo]], and might be seeking to turn himself in. Authorities dismissed this claim as a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2458892.ece|title=Rwandan war criminal reportedly in Oslo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603110323/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2458892.ece|archive-date=3 June 2008|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=- Etterlyst krigsforbryter oppholder seg i Norge|url=https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/i/6zyPO/--Etterlyst-krigsforbryter-oppholder-seg-i-Norge|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=1 June 2008|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KTN news network in Kenya reported on 14 June 2008 that Kabuga had been arrested by Kenya Police the day before and was being held at Gigiri Police Station in [[Nairobi]]. Later, the suspect was found to be a local university lecturer, not Kabuga as previously thought, and released. It is suspected that Kabuga is in Kenya,&lt;ref name=iopqz&gt;{{cite news |last=Nyawo |first=James |date=4 August 2011 |title=Risking Irrelevance: The Threat of Impunity to the African Union |url=http://jurist.org/forum/2011/08/james-nyawo-africa-justice.php |publisher=[[JURIST]] |access-date=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is believed to be running businesses and enjoying protection from either the Kenyan government or some influential figures within the country.&lt;ref name=iopqz /&gt;

'''Generally Accepted Accounting Practice''' in the UK, or '''UK GAAP''', is the overall body of regulation establishing how company accounts must be prepared in the [[United Kingdom]].  Company accounts must also be prepared in accordance with applicable company law (for UK companies, The [[Companies Act 2006]], for companies in the [[Channel Islands]] and the [[Isle of Man]], companies law applicable to those jurisdictions).

'''Generally accepted accounting practice''' is a [[statute|statutory]] term in the UK Taxes Acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140109143644/http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/practitioners/clause50.htm Generally accepted accounting practice] defined on the [[HMRC]] website, as archived by the [[National Archive]]. Retrieved 27 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The abbreviation "UK GAAP" is also accepted as an abbreviation for the term used in other jurisdictions, '''Generally Accepted Accounting Principles''', or Generally Accepted Accounting Policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icaew.com/index.cfm/route/156255/icaew_ga/en/technical_and_business_topics/guides_and_publications/knowledge_guides/em_uk_accounting_standards_em#gaap Knowledge guide to UK Accounting Standards] on [[ICAEW]] website. Retrieved 6 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Accounting standards derive from a number of sources.  The chief standard-setter is the [[Accounting Standards Board]] (ASB), which issues standards called ''Financial Reporting Standards'' (FRS).  The ASB is part of the [[Financial Reporting Council]], an independent regulator funded by a levy on listed companies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frc.org.uk/about/funding.cfm Funding] on FRC website. Retrieved 6 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and it replaced the Accounting Standards Committee (ASC), which was disbanded in 1990 following a number of criticisms of its work.  To the extent that the ASC's pronouncements, known as ''Statements of Standard Accounting Practice'' (SSAPs), have not been replaced by FRS, they remain in force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icaew.com/index.cfm/route/156373/icaew_ga/en/Library/Links/Accounting_standards/UK/Sources_for_SSAPs Sources for SSAPs] on [[ICAEW]] website. Retrieved 6 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process for setting standards==
The ASB has a formal exposure process for proposed standards.  Early concepts are issued as ''Discussion Papers''.  These are released to the public and comments invited.  Where a new standard is to be proposed, a ''Financial Reporting Exposure Draft'' (FRED) is released for comment.  The standard in final form is only issued when comments have been incorporated or addressed.  This aims to address the criticisms levelled at the ASC, whose comment process was less rigorous.

Issues that require an immediate solution are considered by the ''Urgent Issues Task Force'' (UITF).  The UITF comprises a number of senior figures from industry and accounting firms.  It meets as necessary to consider pressing issues and issues ''Abstracts'' which become binding immediately.

== Legislation ==
The principal legislation governing reporting in the UK is laid down in the [[Companies Act 2006]], which incorporates the requirements of [[European law]].  The Companies Act sets out certain minimum reporting requirements for companies and, for example, requires limited companies to file their accounts with the [[Registrar of Companies]] who makes them available to the general public.

From 2005, this framework changed as a result of [[European law]] requiring that all listed [[Europe]]an companies report under [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRSs). In the UK, companies which are not listed have the option to report either under IFRSs or under UK GAAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dti.gov.uk/bbf/financial-reporting/standards/page21457.html |title=International Standards (Accounting) |accessdate= 2010-12-06 |author= |date= |work= |publisher= [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|DTI]] |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070807130010/http://www.dti.gov.uk/bbf/financial-reporting/standards/page21457.html |archivedate=2007-08-07 }} &lt;/ref&gt; Recently issued UK FRSs have, in any case replicated the wording of corresponding IFRSs, reducing the differences between the two sets of standards significantly. 

== New UK GAAP ==
A new financial reporting framework came into effect in the UK on 1 January 2015.

The UK's Financial Reporting Council (FRC) published five standards which together form the basis of the new UK regime. The Financial Reporting Standard for Smaller Entities will continue to be available for those that qualify to use it and will remain fundamentally unaltered for the time being.

In March 2013 the [[Financial Reporting Council|FRC]] (now responsible for issuing accounting standards in the UK) issued FRS 102, The Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and [[Republic of Ireland]]. This followed the issue of FRS 100 Application of Financial Reporting Requirements and FRS 101 The Reduced Disclosure Framework in November 2012. Together these standards make up what is commonly being referred to by accountants as new UK GAAP, which takes mandatory effect for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newukgaap.co.uk/what-is-new-uk-gaap/impact-of-new-uk-gaap |title=International Standards (Accounting) |accessdate=2013-06-20 |author=Julia Penny |date= |work= |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622055244/http://www.newukgaap.co.uk/what-is-new-uk-gaap/impact-of-new-uk-gaap |archivedate=2013-06-22 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

FRS 102 replaces almost 3000 pages of current UK and Ireland GAAP with just over 300. The main purpose is to make reporting requirements proportionate to the size of the entity, and it also includes changes to disclosure, measurement, and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sage-exchange.co.uk/news/new-uk-gaap-frs102 |title=New UK GAAP: FRS 102 |author=Sage UK |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gomal University is a [[University charter|chartered]] university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Addresses of Chartered Universities |url=http://www.hec.gov.pk/InsideHEC/Divisions/QALI/DegreeAttestationEquivalence/UniversityAccreditation/ENUDAI/Pages/AddressesofCharteredUniversities.aspx |publisher=HEC |accessdate=30 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217035645/http://www.hec.gov.pk/InsideHEC/Divisions/QALI/DegreeAttestationEquivalence/UniversityAccreditation/ENUDAI/Pages/AddressesofCharteredUniversities.aspx |archivedate=17 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the 12th oldest university in HEC's seniority listings.

It was founded by the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] who laid the establishment of Gomal University in [[D I Khan]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]].&lt;ref name="Seniority listings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Seniority listings |url=http://www.hec.gov.pk/InsideHEC/Divisions/QALI/DegreeAttestationEquivalence/UniversityAccreditation/ENUDAI/Pages/SeniorityList.aspx |accessdate=30 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131152204/http://www.hec.gov.pk/InsideHEC/Divisions/QALI/DegreeAttestationEquivalence/UniversityAccreditation/ENUDAI/Pages/SeniorityList.aspx |archivedate=31 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister Bhutto laid down the foundation stone of Gomal University on 1 May 1974 putting forward his policy of a highly educated Pakistan to meet modern world challenges in every aspect of life. The donations and land were provided by Nawab Allah Nawaz Khan who served as the university's first and founding [[Vice Chancellor]]. Nawaz Khan donated 11000 [[Kanal (unit)|Kn]] agricultural land to the establishment of the university.

The Act No. X of 1974 provides the constitutional establishment of the university as a public research university categorization.&lt;ref name="Seniority listings"/&gt;

'''Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit''' (19 February 1822&amp;nbsp;– 23 February 1876), was an [[Andorra]]n nobleman and politician.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit was born on 19 February 1822 in [[La Seu d'Urgell]] in the Catalan [[Pyrenees]], close to the [[Principality of Andorra]]. He was the only son of Josep Plandolit Targarona and Maria Rosa Areny.{{sfn|Obiols|Miró|2014|p=203}}{{sfn|Albert i Corp|1988}} He belonged to one of the most prominent Catalan families at the time, with a long industrial and commercial background that traces its origins back to the 17th century.{{sfn|Codina et al.|2006|p=6}}

His mother died nine months after his birth, in September. Afterward, Josep and his son moved to Andorra, settling in [[Ordino]] where he eventually remarried. Josep died on 17 July 1843 aged 55 at the family estate after a long illness.{{sfn|Bacquer|1998}}

In 1841, at the age of 19, Areny-Plandolit married Maria Dolors Parella, Baroness of Senaller.{{sfn|Miró i Solà|2016|loc=''Segle XIX''}} They had seven children, five of whom survived to adulthood.{{sfn|Bacquer|1998}} 

=== Wife's murder ===
Tragedy struck on 19 June 1855, when his first wife was murdered at the age of 30 in [[Barcelona]], where the family had property they frequently visited. Her attacker, Blas Durana Atauri, stabbed her 13 times in a carefully premeditated attack.{{sfn|Blanche|1862|p=627}} The crime became well-known in 19th-century Barcelona and shocked the public at the time because of the status and personality of those involved and also for its bizarre aftermath.{{sfn|Blanche|1862|p=632}}{{sfn|Theros|2012|loc=''El País''}}

Durana was an infantry colonel in the [[Spanish Army]] and was stationed in Barcelona at the time. He frequently attended social gatherings where he attempted to climb the social ladder and court women. He soon caught wind of the Baroness and fell deeply in love with her. Parella initially welcomed and tolerated his compliments, but became alarmed when Durana began appearing at an increasing amount of the same gatherings, apparently not letting up.{{sfn|Olmos|2015|loc=''El Correo''}} 

[[File:Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit 02.png|thumb|left|upright=1|Areny-Plandolit in 1866]]
After complaining to her husband, Areny-Plandolit was annoyed enough to ask his friend, [[Captain General of Catalonia]] Juan Zapatero y Navas, for help. Zapatero agreed to redeploy Durana to [[Lugo]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] to mend the situation.{{sfn|Miró i Solà|2016|loc=''Segle XIX''}} Durana was able to continue his amorous siege by making up excuses and taking advantage of every opportunity to return to Barcelona, apparently still motivated by love. Fueled by frustration and envy, this feeling eventually turned into hatred. Desperate and embittered, he decided to kill Parella.{{sfn|Theros|2012|loc=''El País''}}

Durana had spent the day of the attack carefully observing the Areny-Plandolit and Parella property, hiding in an alleyway on the opposite street. He attacked the Baroness at dusk when she finally came out of the house in order to visit a theater; she died within twenty minutes.{{sfn|Blanche|1862|p=628}} As he did not attempt to flee, he was quickly captured by a local militia to whom he quickly identified himself and triumphantly admitted his crime.{{sfn|Blanche|1862|p=628}} 

Durana's lawyer tried to argue that mental instability was to blame and referred to past incidents to prove this claim.{{sfn|Blanche|1862|p=631}} However, he was quickly convicted and sentenced to be executed by garrotte.{{sfn|Blanche|1862|p=629}} Although Durana remained calm and composed during the sentencing, the method of execution came unexpectedly since he had expected to be put in front of a firing squad, something more befitting a colonel. His request to change the method of execution was denied.{{sfn|Blanche|1862|p=632}}{{sfn|Pallarès-Personat|2007}}

Durana committed suicide on the eve of the execution by means of [[Mercury(II) cyanide|mercuric cyanide]], likely smuggled in by an army comrade on an earlier visit to him in prison.{{sfn|Miró i Solà|2016|loc=''Segle XIX''}}{{sfn|Blanche|1862|pp=633–635}} Rumors had been going around that the trial had been a farce and that the colonel, as a result of his rank, would somehow be allowed to escape his fate. As a result, a large crowd had gathered on the morning of the execution to witness the event. To avoid a riot, authorities wheeled out his dead body and went through the motions of the execution; essentially executing his corpse.{{sfn|Theros|2012|loc=''El País''}}{{sfn|Blanche|1862|p=634}}{{sfn|Bofarull i Terrades|2002}}

Areny-Plandolit was not present at the burial of his first wife and appears not to have mourned for long, if at all.{{sfn|Miró i Solà|2016|loc=''Segle XIX''}} He remarried a little more than three months later, to Carolina de Plandolit, his cousin.{{sfn|Pérez|2017|loc=''Taxidermidades''}} They had ten children.{{sfn|Bacquer|1998}}

=== New Reform ===
{{seealso|Andorra#19th century: the New Reform and the Andorran Question{{!}}New Reform and the Andorran Question}}
Andorra in the mid-19th century was a country in an economic crisis. Areny-Plandolit led the [[reforms]] to replace the aristocratic and [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] that previously ruled the state. The political system was largely governed based on the privileges of a small social group formed of traditional wealthy Andorran families, to whom his family also belonged. This type of oligarchical governance made it possible for them to control all the decisions made by the [[General Council (Andorra)|General Council of the Valleys]], and to manage public resources as they pleased.{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp=178–179}}

With a total estimated population of only 4,000 residents, whose economic power was growing and eventually even surpassing that of the original wealthy families, more and more voices were demanding social and political changes. The General Council reacted with a steady refusal and inaction. This led to a group of reformists led by Areny-Plandolit to organize meetings in order to discuss the best way to bring about reform.{{sfn|Peruga Guerrero|1998}}

[[File:Pla de la Nova Reforma d'Andorra.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A picture of the Plan of the New Reform of Andorra in a glass box in a museum|Plan of the New Reform of Andorra]]
On 22 April 1866, The New Reform ({{lang-ca|Nova Reforma}}) was decreed by the Episcopal [[Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-Prince]], Bishop [[Josep Caixal i Estradé]], and established the basis of the [[Constitution of Andorra|Andorran constitution]] and symbols (such as the [[Flag of Andorra|tricolor flag]]) of Andorra. It was ratified three years later by [[Napoleon&amp;nbsp;III]].{{sfn|Pons|2018|loc=''El Nacional''}}

The reforms had several effects. Most importantly, it gave every citizen of the country the right to vote. It also promised regular elections; in this case twelve of the twenty-four councilors were to be elected every two years, with a maximum post length of four years. There was also the creation of the position of town commissioner in order to control public spending and put a halt to the waste of resources.{{sfn|Albert i Corp|1988}}

After producing the official document listing the reforms in May 1866, Areny-Plandolit was elected [[List of First Syndics of the General Council|First Syndic]] of the General Council, a position akin to [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]].{{sfn|Albert i Corp|1988}}{{sfn|Armengol Aleix|2009|pp=345–347}}

{{Quote|text = To name the authorities constituting the Common, all the voters of each parish shall have a right to vote. To name the four members of the General Council, all of the voters of each parish shall also have the right to vote.{{sfn|d'Areny-Plandolit|1866}} |title = Excerpt from the Plan of the New Reform}}

== Biography ==
Van Dongen studied psychology in [[Leiden]] under [[Jan Hendrik van den Berg]]. He specialized both in social and clinical psychology. He earned his bachelor's degree in social and clinical psychology at the [[University of Leiden]] in 1962. While working at [[Hoogovens]], van Dongen earned his PhD in 1969 from the [[Catholic University of Tilburg]] for his dissertation on the social impact of the suggestion box ([[:nl:ideeënbus|ideeënbus]]).

The 1960s was the period of [[democratization]] of public and private spheres during which radically new concepts of [[management]] were developed and applied. After this business experience in [[Human resource management|Human Resource and Personnel Management]], he moved to the academic world. In 1976 he accepted a position in the [[Rotterdam School of Management|Graduate School of Management (Interfaculteit Bedrijfskunde)]], originally established in [[Delft]] as a joint initiative of the schools of economics, law and social sciences of [[Erasmus University Rotterdam|Erasmus University]], and the schools of civil, mechanical and maritime engineering and general sciences at the [[Delft University of Technology]].

As professor of social and organizational psychology, van Dongen's main focus was the [[Social psychology|social]] implications of technological change. In the late 1970s he conducted a study of the social and cultural consequences of [[information technology]] for the [http://www.rathenau.nl/en/who-we-are/history.html Rathenau] Commission formed by [[Joop den Uyl|Prime Minister Den Uyl]]. During this period he started a lifelong exchange with American academic [[Abbe Mowshowitz]].

He was active not only in academia but advised a range of public and private organizations (especially in the transport, infrastructure, banking and pharmacy sectors), e.g., [[KLM]], [[Port of Rotterdam]], [[Rabobank]], [[Schiphol|Schiphol Airport]], [[Eli Lilly and Company]]. In the context of organizational advice and policy analysis, Henk van Dongen played an important role in shaping such organizations as [[:nl:Sioo|SIOO]] and [[:nl:Nederlandse School voor Openbaar Bestuur|NSOB]] (Dutch School of Public Governance).

Henk van Dongen was married to Fieke van Dongen, and has three daughters and nine grandchildren.

== Work ==
In the Dutch context Henk van Dongen influenced several generations of students and practitioners in the field of management. His insights on [[interaction]], conflict and [[reality]] definition were further developed by several of his doctoral students.

=== Qualitative Research ===
The work of van Dongen is characterized by a radical rejection of [[entity]]-like concepts or thinking. His process worldview was very much influenced by [[Norbert Elias]], [[Symbolic Interactionism]], French [[existentialism]], and certain [[Postmodernism|postmodern insights]]. He also worked on philosophical concepts stemming from [[logic]] and [[ethics]]. The law of inconsistency figured prominently in his thinking (see the work of intuitionists such as [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]] and [[Gaston Bachelard|Bachelard]] on the law of excluded middle, and the concept of ''[[Apophatic theology|via negativa]]'' in theology).

Moreover, his view on ethics was predicated on the idea that rules or principles of conduct should encourage diversity and support a process of negotiation among contending parties. For this reason he emphasized the need to formulate ethical guidelines in the negative (as statements of the form “you ought not …”), and firmly rejected any form of idolatry, insisting that each individual take responsibility for his or her actions.

Van Dongen introduced the work of [[Karl Weick]] into Dutch management circles and emphasized the importance of [[Qualitative Research]].

== Publications ==
Van Dongen authored and co-authored many publications in the field of management.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=H.J.+van+Dongen&amp;btnG=&amp;lr= H.J. van Dongen] at Google Scholar.&lt;/ref&gt; A selection:

==Career==
===Google===
[[File:A Press Conference for the Launch of Nexus 7 on September 27, 2012 in Seoul from acrofan 3.JPG|thumb|Barra with [[Eric Schmidt]] and [[Andy Rubin]] at the launch of the [[Nexus 7 (2012)|Nexus 7]]]]
Barra joined American technology company [[Google]] in [[London]] in March 2008 as Group Product Manager for the [[Google Mobile Services|Google Mobile]] team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/changingmediasummit/speaker-hugo-barra|title=Hugo Barra|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Barra joined the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/events/thinkmobile2011/bios.html |title=Speaker Bios |work=Google |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727231423/http://www.google.com/events/thinkmobile2011/bios.html |archivedate=27 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010 to 2013, Barra’s role expanded to include product spokesperson for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] team, speaking at both press conferences and [[Google I/O]], [[Google|Google’s]] annual developer-focused conference. Barra’s product involvement included the entire [[Android (operating system)|Android]] ecosystem of software and hardware, including [[Honeycomb (operating system)|Honeycomb]], [[Ice Cream Sandwich (operating system)|Ice Cream Sandwich]], [[Jelly Bean (operating system)|Jelly Bean]] and [[KitKat (operating system)|KitKat]] [[operating system]] launches, the [[Nexus 4]] and [[Nexus 5]] smartphones, the [[Google Nexus|Nexus 7]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techland.time.com/2013/07/24/google-unveils-a-new-nicer-pricier-nexus-7-tablet/|title=Google Unveils a New, Nicer, Pricier Nexus 7 Tablet|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Google Nexus|Nexus 10]] tablets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.androidauthority.com/hugo-barra-android-tablet-htc-one-250126/|title=Hugo Barra: where are the Android tablets of HTC One-like quality?|work=Android Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other related products such as [[Google Now]],&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/07/google-android-hugo-barra-interview/|title=Android Director: ‘We Have the Most Accurate, Conversational, Synthesized Voice in the World’|work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; selected in 2013 as [[Popular Science (magazine)|Popular Science’s]] Innovation of the Year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/bown/2012/product/google-now|title=Innovation Of The Year: Google Now|work=Popular Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Google Voice Search]], [[Google|Google’s]] speech recognition service. He was promoted to Vice President in 2012.

===Xiaomi===
In September 2013, Barra left [[Google]] for Chinese electronics company [[Xiaomi]], serving as Vice President of International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingsd.com/20130912/exclusive-hugo-barra-talks-about-his-future-at-xiaomi-and-why-he-left-google/|title=Exclusive: Hugo Barra Talks About His Future at Xiaomi and Why He Really Left Google|work=All Things D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was considered a ‘significant hire’ for Xiaomi, one of the fastest growing manufacturers in China, enhancing international legitimacy to the company by adding a key former Google [[Android (operating system)|Android]] executive to its senior management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/asia/2013/08/29/xiaomi-reportedly-nabs-google-vp-hugo-barra/|title=Xiaomi confirms it has hired Google’s Hugo Barra, who will take up VP Global role from October|work=The Next Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Barra spoke at [[LeWeb]] tech conference in [[Paris, France]] about his impressions of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference|Chinese]] economy and the opportunity it represented for tech companies such as [[Xiaomi]], citing China's 600&amp;nbsp;million internet users, high market caps of recent Chinese IPOs, the massive scale of the top Chinese apps' monthly active users, and the size of companies such as [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba's]] [[Taobao]], a shopping site more than double the size of [[eBay]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/156977/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chinese-tech-in-one-30-minute-video/|title=Everything you need to know about Chinese tech in one 30-minute video|work=Quartz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The talk was widely cited throughout the industry.&lt;ref name="businessinsider.com"/&gt;

In February 2014, Barra announced the launch of the new [[Xiaomi Mi1|Redmi]] and [[Xiaomi Mi3|Mi3]] smartphones in [[Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/asia/2014/02/19/can-chinas-coolest-phone-maker-take-xiaomi-mania-international-we-ask-vp-hugo-barra/|title=Can China’s coolest phone maker take Xiaomi-mania international? We ask VP Hugo Barra|work=The Next Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; then in [[India]]. Global expansion outside of China into surrounding emerging markets is a key initiative for [[Xiaomi]], given the company’s business model to release high performance smartphone products at an affordable consumer price, generating revenue not only from the hardware itself, but the software and internet services provided to the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/asia/2013/09/06/heres-why-you-should-care-about-rising-chinese-smartphone-firm-xiaomi/|title=Here’s why you should care about rising Chinese smartphone firm Xiaomi|work=The Next Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Xiaomi]] co-founder and president [[Lei Jun]], it is "entirely Barra’s job to figure out which region that we should enter next and how."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/asia/2013/09/09/xiaomi-co-founder-on-why-ex-google-exec-barra-and-its-own-firmware-are-key-to-international-success/|title=Xiaomi co-founder on why ex-Google exec Barra and its own firmware are key to international success|work=The Next Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barra has stated intentions to expand next into various countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/xiaomi-world-phone-in-2-years-android-all-the-way-says-hugo-barra/|title=Xiaomi's Hugo Barra: True world phones in 2 years, Android all the way|work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Barra visited [[Foxconn]], a Taiwanese manufacturing company with plants in [[Brazil]] and [[Mexico]] responsible for assembling products for various tech brands, indicating plans for [[Xiaomi]] to expand into [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techinasia.com/hugo-barra-teases-xiaomi-foxconn-deal-for-latin-america/|title=Hugo Barra visits Foxconn, teases Xiaomi launches across Latin America |work=techinasia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, Barra announced the launch of the [[Xiaomi#MiPad|MiPad]], a 7.9 inch tablet. "We spent four years working up to the point where we thought we had the right hardware design and software capability to build a world-class tablet," Barra said. "We think we are there, finally." Barra described the release as part of [[Xiaomi|Xiaomi's]] overall strategy to expand both its product lineup and into new international markets including [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Singapore]]. Barra also indicated eventual plans to enter the [[United States|U.S.]] market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thevarguy.com/business-smartphone-and-tablet-technology-solutions/051914/ex-google-whiz-barra-s-influence-showing-xiaomi|title=Ex-Google Whiz Barra’s Influence Showing at Xiaomi |work=thevarguy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, Barra announced his departure from Xiaomi. Barra explained his decision had been strongly motivated by a feeling of detachment from his family and the life he had built up in Silicon Valley. "What I've realized is that the last few years of living in such a singular environment have taken a huge toll on my life and started affecting my health. My friends, what I consider to be my home, and my life are back in Silicon Valley, which is also much closer to my family. Seeing how much I've left behind these past few years, it is clear to me that the time has come to return." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/23/14355260/hugo-barra-is-leaving-xiaomi|title=Hugo Barra is leaving Xiaomi|work=theverge.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are reports that quoted Barra saying that his resignation was prompted by health reasons and some analysts noted that the departure came amid Xiaomi's declining sales in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/895226/hugo-barra-is-leaving-xiaomi-to-lead-up-facebooks-nasdaq-fb-vr-efforts/|title=Hugo Barra is leaving Xiaomi to lead Facebook’s virtual reality division|last=Horwitz|first=Josh|date=26 January 2017|work=Quartz|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2064612/hugo-barra-resigns-xiaomi-says-he-returning-silicon-valley|title=Hugo Barra to leave Xiaomi, return to Silicon Valley from Beijing|last=Soo|first=Zen|date=23 January 2017|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, global expansion has been successful. Around the time of his resignation, Xiaomi announced that it has exceeded US$1 billion in revenue from the Indian market alone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Facebook===
He announced in a Facebook post on 25 January 2017 that he would be joining Facebook as Vice President of virtual reality, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I’m excited to share my next adventure as I return to Silicon Valley—in a couple of months I'll be joining Facebook as VP of virtual reality (VPVR!) and lead the Oculus team. Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun always says that the highest calling of an engineer is to make technology breakthroughs quickly and readily available to the widest possible spectrum of humanity. That will be my mission at Facebook and I look forward to building the future of immersive technology with Mark Zuckerberg, Brendan Trexler Iribe, Mike Schroepfer, and the visionaries in the Oculus team."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/hbarra76/posts/10154020362016612&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Based on his early pronouncements, Barra appears to be focusing on the development of standalone VR headsets as well as social VR. During an appearance at the 2018 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES), he described the technology as "a product category that will help us bring the most number of people into VR and really start unlocking these opportunities for social presence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/16/facebook-hugo-barra-standalone-vr/|title=Facebook's Hugo Barra says standalone headsets are key to social VR|last=Lee|first=Nicole|date=16 January 2018|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the event, Barra announced Oculus' standalone VR headset called Oculus Go, with Xiaomi as global hardware partner.

==Honors and awards==
In 2011, Barra was ranked #23 in [[Wired (magazine)|Wired Magazine’s]] Wired 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/06/the-wired-100/the-wired-100-29-11|title=2nd annual Wired 100|work=Wired.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Business Insider|Business Insider’s]] [[Silicon Valley]] 100 included Barra at #92.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-silicon-valley-100-2013-2?op=1|title=The 100 Biggest Stars In Silicon Valley|work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil's ''[[Época (Brazilian magazine)|Época]]'' magazine ranked Barra among the most influential [[Brazilian people|Brazilians]] in both 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revistaepoca.globo.com/vida/noticia/2011/12/epoca-100-os-brasileiros-mais-influentes-de-2011-trecho.html|title=Época Magazine: the 100 most influential Brazilians in 2011|work=Época Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://epoca.globo.com/vida/noticia/2013/12/os-b100-mais-influentes-do-brasilb-em-2013.html|title=Época Magazine: the 100 most influential Brazilians in 2013|work=Época Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Human Capital Supply Chain''''' is a book by Tim Giehl and Sara Moss.

==Origin of term==
"Human capital supply chain" refers to the integration of business planning, strategic [[workforce planning]], staffing and recruiting processes and technology to enhance corporate productivity and profitability. Employing methods of common manufacturing and distribution [[supply chain management]] principles to [[human resources]] and [[human capital]], corporations create an end-to-end, human capital supply chain.

The term was introduced in the 2009 book, ''Human Capital Supply Chains''. The concept consolidates 30 years of expertise by companies like [[Toyota]], [[Wal-Mart]], and [[Dell]] in [[total quality management]], lean and strategic supplier relationships, and applies it to the human resources industry. The major aim when implementing a human capital supply chain is to reduce labor costs. While that is attained in the short-term, the long-term tuning of the supply chain can result in growth and strategic competitive advantage.

The extensive use of [[game theory]] in industrial economics has led to the export of this tool to other branches of [[microeconomics]], such as [[behavioral economics]] and [[corporate finance]]. Industrial organization has also had significant practical impacts on [[antitrust law]] and [[competition policy]].&lt;ref&gt;Exemplified in such advanced textbooks as [[Jean Tirole]], 1988,  ''The Theory of Industrial Organization'', MIT Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HIjsF0XONF8C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s description] and chapter-preview [https://books.google.com/books?id=HIjsF0XONF8C&amp;pg=PP11 links.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market structures==
The common [[market structure]]s studied in this field are the following:
*[[Perfect competition]]
*[[Monopolistic competition]]
*[[Duopoly]]
*[[Oligopoly]]
*[[Oligopsony]]
*[[Monopoly]]
*[[Monopsony]]

==Areas of study==
Industrial organization investigates the outcomes of these market structures in environments with
*[[Price discrimination]]
*[[Product differentiation]]
*[[Durable good]]s
*[[Experience good]]s
*[[Secondary market]]s, which can affect the behaviour of firms in primary markets.
*[[Collusion]]
*[[Signalling (economics)|Signalling]], such as warranties and advertising.
*[[Mergers and acquisitions]]
*[[Entry (economics)|Entry]] and [[Exit (economics)|Exit]]

==History of the field==
A 2009 book ''Pioneers of Industrial Organization'' traces the development of the field from [[Adam Smith]] to recent times and includes dozens of short biographies of major figures in Europe and North America who contributed to the growth and development of the discipline.&lt;ref name="“bazar1"&gt;Henry W. de Jong and William G.

The '''International Chamber of Commerce''' ('''ICC'''; [[French language|French]]: ''Chambre de commerce internationale'') is the largest, most representative business organization in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/international-chamber-of-commerce-icc.asp International Chamber Of Commerce (ICC) Definition]. Investopedia (2011-04-21). Retrieved on 2013-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Its 6 million members in over 100 countries have interests spanning every sector of private enterprise.

ICC has three main activities: rule setting, dispute resolution, and policy advocacy. Because its member companies and associations are themselves engaged in international business, ICC has unrivalled authority in making rules that govern the conduct of business across borders. Although these rules are voluntary, they are observed in countless thousands of transactions every day and have become part of international trade.

A world network of national committees in over 100 countries advocates business priorities at national and regional level. More than 3,000 experts drawn from ICC’s member companies feed their knowledge and experience into crafting the ICC stance on specific business issues.

ICC supports the work of the [[United Nations]], the [[World Trade Organization]], and many other intergovernmental bodies, both international and regional, such as [[G20]]&lt;ref&gt;https://iccwbo.org/global-issues-trends/global-governance/g20/&lt;/ref&gt; on behalf of international business. ICC was the first organization granted [[List of organizations with consultative status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council|general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council]] and UN Observer Status &lt;ref&gt;https://iccwbo.org/media-wall/news-speeches/un-general-assembly-grants-observer-status-international-chamber-commerce-historic-decision/&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
The International Chamber of Commerce was founded in 1919 to serve world business by promoting trade and investment, open markets for goods and services, and the free flow of capital. The organization's international secretariat was established in [[Paris]] and the ICC's [[International Court of Arbitration]] was created in 1923.

ICC's first chairman was 20th-century French [[Alexandre Ribot#Ribot's 4th Ministry, 9 June 1914 – 13 June 1914|Minister of Finance]] Etienne Clémentel. 

== Membership ==
There are two ways to become a member of ICC:&lt;ref&gt;How to join ICC?, accessed Jan 27, 2011 on {{cite web |url=http://www.iccwbo.org/id19698/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225024056/http://www.iccwbo.org/id19698/index.html |archivedate=2011-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Through affiliation with an ICC national committee or group.

2. By direct membership with the ICC International Secretariat when a national committee/group has not yet been established in the country/territory.

==Governing bodies ==

===World Council===

ICC's supreme governing body is the World Council, consisting of representatives of national committees. The World Council elects ICC’s highest officers, including the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman, each of whom serves a two-year term. The Chairman, Vice-Chairman and the Honorary Chairman (the immediate past Chairman) provide the organization with high-level world leadership. They play an important role in ICC section.

===Executive Board===
Strategic direction for ICC is provided by its executive board, consisting of up to 30 business leaders and ex-officio members. It is elected by the World Council on the recommendation of the Chairmanship. Meeting three times a year, the Executive Board oversees the establishment of ICC’s strategic priorities and the implementation of its policies.

===International Secretariat===
The ICC International Secretariat, based in Paris, is the operational arm of ICC. It develops and carries out ICC’s work programme, feeding business views into intergovernmental organizations on issues that directly affect business operations. The International Secretariat is led by the Secretary General, who is appointed by the World Council.

===National Committees===
In 92 of the world’s nations, members have established formal ICC structures called national committees. In countries where there is no national committee, companies and organizations such as chambers of commerce and professional associations can become direct members.

===Finance Committee===
The Finance Committee advises the Executive Board on all financial matters. On behalf of the Executive Board, it prepares the budget and regularly reports to the board. It reviews the financial implications of ICC activities and supervises the flow of revenues and expenses of the organization.

== Dispute Resolution Services ==
ICC's administered dispute resolution services help solve difficulties in international business. ICC Arbitration is a private procedure that leads to a binding and enforceable decision.

The International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce steers ICC Arbitration and has received over 21,000 cases since its inception in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;ICC Booklet "Rules of Arbitration and Rules for a Pre-Arbitral Referee Procedure", P. 7, France 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past decade, the Court's workload has considerably expanded.

The Court's membership has also grown and now covers 85 countries and territories. With representatives in North America, Latin and Central America, Africa and the Middle East and Asia, the ICC Court has significantly increased its training activities on all continents and in all major languages used in international trade.

ICC Dispute Resolution Services exist in many forms:

*Arbitration is a flexible and efficient dispute resolution procedure leading to binding and final decisions subject to enforcement worldwide.
*Mediation is a flexible technique, conducted privately and confidentially, in which a neutral facilitator helps parties to seek a negotiated settlement of their dispute.
*Dispute boards are independent bodies designed to help resolve disagreements arising during the course of a contract.
*Expertise is a way of finding the right person to make an independent assessment on any subject relevant to business operations.
*DOCDEX provides expert decisions to resolve disputes related to documentary credits, collections and demand guarantees, incorporating ICC banking rules.

== Policy and business practices ==
ICC policies, rules and standards are prepared by specialized working bodies. Normal procedure requires policy statements first to be adopted by a commission, in consultation with national committees, and then approved by the Executive Board, before they can be regarded as official and public ICC positions.

Commissions examine major policy issues of interest to world business. Each national committee (NC) or group may appoint delegates to represent it at meetings. Officers are appointed by the Chairman and Secretary General in consultation with NCs. Meetings of commissions are normally held twice a year.

Task forces are constituted under the various commissions for a limited period to undertake specific projects and report back to their parent commission. Some task forces may include representatives of more than one commission.

=== Code of Advertising and Marketing Communication Practice ===
In September 2011, the International Chamber of Commerce introduced the newly revised consolidated ICC Code of Advertising and Marketing Communication Practice, along with a dedicated website, www.codescentre.com, to guide advertising and marketing professionals around the globe. This Code sets ethical standards and guidelines for businesses using today’s rapidly changing technology, tools and techniques to market products and services. Developed by experts from all sectors of industry and all regions of the world, the code’s purpose is to protect consumers by clearly setting out guidelines for responsible marketing.

The Code is structured in two main sections—General Provisions and Chapters. The General Provisions section contains fundamental principles and other broad concepts that apply to all marketing in all media. Code Chapters are detailed and apply to specific marketing areas, including: Sales Promotion, Sponsorship, Direct Marketing, Digital Media and Environmental Marketing Claim.

== World Chambers Federation ==
In 1951, ICC established the [http://www.iccwbo.org/wcf%20 World Chambers Federation] (WCF), formerly the International Bureau of Chambers of Commerce. WCF is the unique global forum uniting the worldwide network of more than 12,000 chambers of commerce and industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iccwbo.org/about-icc/organization/world-chambers-federation/ World Chambers Federation | Organization | About ICC | ICC - International Chamber of Commerce&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to facilitate the exchange of best practice and the development of new global products and services for chambers, and foster international partnerships between chambers and other stakeholders to help local businesses grow.&lt;ref&gt;World Chambers Federation introduction. USCIB, 2013 http://www.iccwbo.org/chamber-services/world-chambers-congress/about-the-congress/&lt;/ref&gt; WCF is a non-political, non-governmental body, with its membership comprising local, regional, national, bilateral and transnational chambers of commerce, as well as public-law and private-law chambers.

WCF was established by ICC and its chamber members following a resolution at the conclusion of the World Congress of Chambers of Commerce (Rome 1950). At its inaugural committee meeting held in Paris in December 1950, WCF was to be first known as the International Information Bureau of Chambers of Commerce. As its role expanded and grew during the 1960s, its name changed to become the International Bureau of Chambers of Commerce and by June 2001, it became known as the World Chambers Federation.

With a history spanning over 400 years, chambers today exist in almost every country and business community around the world. Chambers of Commerce and Industry can be defined as:
* multi-sector organizations that accept members without sectorial restrictions
* not pursuing political goals (i.e., they do not participate in elections or nominate candidates for political positions)
* acting as a voice for the business community (i.e., they advocate for business and promote legislation that is advantageous to business) 
* facilitating the role of chambers of commerce as local business support agencies
* Administering the international guarantee chain of [[ATA Carnet]]s, the Customs document allowing the duty-free and tax-free temporary import of goods 
* Improving the capacity of chambers in issuing [[certificates of origin]], including the management of an International CO chain 
* World Chambers Network – a website platform with services including a Global Chamber Directory, Business Opportunities Promotion Service ChamberTrust Business Accreditation Programme
* Chamber Professional and institutional development services

WCF also organizes the [http://www.iccwbo.org/chamber-services/world-chambers-congress/about-the-congress/ World Chambers Congress] every two years in a different region of the world. The Congress is the only international forum for chamber leaders and professionals to share best practices, exchange insights, develop networks, address the latest business issues affecting their communities, and learn about new areas of innovation from chambers around the world.

During the Congress, WCF also announces the winners of [http://www.iccwbo.org/training-and-events/competitions-and-awards/world-chamber-competition/ World Chambers Competition], the only global awards program to recognize the most innovative projects undertaken by chambers of commerce and industry from around the world.

== Training and Events ==
Staged all over the world, ICC events range from large topical conferences to training sessions for small groups. These smaller courses share ICC’s expertise on commercial arbitration and dispute resolution mechanisms as well as ICC's trade tools including Incoterms® rules, uniform customs and practice for documentary [[letter of credit]] (UCP) and international contracts.

&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iccwbo.org/events/id8684/index.html ICC Events] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713220846/http://www.iccwbo.org/events/id8684/index.html |date=2009-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ICC Publications ==
ICC Publications is the publishing arm of the International Chamber of Commerce providing business with essential resources in three broad categories: ICC rules and guidelines, practical commentaries, and reference works. The content of ICC’s publications is derived from the work of ICC commissions, institutions and individual international experts.

ICC publishes mainly for international lawyers, arbitrators, [[banker]]s, traders and students  covering topics such as international banking, international trade reference and terms, law and [[arbitration]], [[counterfeiting]] and fraud and model commercial contracts. The best known publications, [[Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits]] and [[Incoterms]]®, have been translated into more than 30 languages.

ICC offers its publications not only in the traditional paper format, but also in electronic format, [[eBook]]s, on the ICC Store.

&lt;ref&gt;[http://store.iccwbo.org/ ICC Store]&lt;/ref&gt;

== ICC Commercial Crime Services ==

ICC Commercial Crime Services (CCS) provides the world business community with a centralized commercial crime-fighting body. It draws on the worldwide resources of its members in the fight against commercial crime on many fronts.

From its base in London, and comprising three distinct bureaux, CCS operates according to two basic principles: to prevent commercial crime and to investigate and help prosecute criminals involved in commercial crime.

The specialized divisions of CCS are:
*International Maritime Bureau
*Financial Investigation Bureau
*Counterfeiting Intelligence Bureau
*FraudNet

&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icc-ccs.org/ Commercial Crime Services&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special projects and initiatives ==

===Business Action to Stop Counterfeiting and Piracy===

ICC established BASCAP to take a leading role in the fight against counterfeiting and piracy.

BASCAP unites the global business community to more effectively identify and address intellectual property rights issues and petition for greater commitments by local, national and international officials in the enforcement and protection of IPR.

The work of BASCAP aims to:
*Increase both awareness and understanding of counterfeiting and piracy activities and the associated economic and social harm
*Compel government action and the allocation of resources towards improved IPR enforcement
*Create a culture change to ensure intellectual property is respected and protected

BASCAP speaks out on the damage caused by counterfeiting and piracy, including:
*Harm to the economy, loss of employment prospects
*Danger to consumer health and safety
*Loss of innovation and poor quality products
*Financial links to organized crime
*Erosion of technology transfer

&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iccwbo.org/bascap/id1127/index.html BASCAP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713212029/http://www.iccwbo.org/bascap/id1127/index.html |date=2009-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business Action to Support the Information Society===

ICC set up BASIS (Business Action to Support the Information Society) in mid-2006 to
speak out on a wide range of critical issues, including:
*Internet governance matters such as data protection, privacy, security, and the technical management and coordination of the Internet
*liberalization of the telecoms market
*entrepreneurship
*innovation
*ICTs as tools for development

&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iccwbo.org/basis/ BASIS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713152255/http://www.iccwbo.org/basis/ |date=2009-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ICC Business World Trade Agenda===

The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), in partnership with the Qatar Chamber, launched the ICC Business [http://www.iccwbo.org/global-influence/world-trade-agenda/ World Trade Agenda] initiative in March 2012 to provide private sector leadership in shaping a new multilateral trade policy agenda. The aim of this initiative is ultimately to drive World Trade Organization (WTO) multilateral trade talks out of an 11-year deadlock and "beyond Doha".

The World Trade Agenda is a strong business-led initiative to bolster rules-based trade. The WTO lends its support to this initiative by engaging business to provide recommendations to advance global trade negotiations.

The World Trade Agenda aims to:
*Define multilateral trade negotiation priorities for business
*Help governments set a trade policy agenda for the 21st century that contributes to economic growth and job creation
*Find answers to the current economic crisis and drive more effective trade talks
*Set concrete recommendations to advance global trade negotiations
*Sound the alarm on protectionism
*Gather input and validation from the global business community on trade agenda priorities and recommendations for achieving a Doha victory

Since its launch, the World Trade Agenda initiative has organized consultations with CEOs and senior executives in all major regions of the world to gather input and validation of its recommendations. These business priorities were released during the ICC World Trade Agenda Summit on 22 April 2013 in Doha.

The Agreement on Trade Facilitation was finally adopted at the WTO's 9th Ministerial Conference on 7 December 2013. It was the first major agreement on trade facilitation to have been reached since the creation of the WTO.

&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iccwbo.org/global-influence/world-trade-agenda About | ICC World Trade Agenda Initiative | ICC - International Chamber of Commerce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120140306/http://www.iccwbo.org/global-influence/world-trade-agenda/ |date=2012-11-20 }}. Iccwbo.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===ICC and the United Nations===

Since 1946, ICC has held top-level consultative status with the United Nations and a close working relationship with its specialized agencies. The current ICC Permanent Representative to the UN is Andrew Wilson. On 21 December 2016 the International Chamber of Commerce was granted Observer status by the General Assembly of the United Nations on the basis of General Assembly Resolution (A/RES/71/156)&lt;ref name="UN_ARES71156"&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/71/156 United Nations General Assembly, Session 71, Resolution 156, '''Observer status for the International Chamber of Commerce in the General Assembly'''], accessed 25 September 2017&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 December 2016, ICC was granted Observer Status by 193 members of the UN General Assembly. ICC took up its position as Observer to the General Assembly on 1 January 2017.

== ICC Research Foundation ==

The ICC Research Foundation (ICCRF) was established in 2010 by ICC to commission independent research that contributes to public knowledge, education and debate on the benefits of global trade and investment. The research projects funded by the ICCRF and conducted by leading international researchers and organizations, contribute to the following aims: 
*Demonstrate how employment and growth flow from an expansion of international trade and investment
*Establish that a multilateral approach is particularly beneficial to that end
*Document how protectionism works against the public interest by eroding employment, sustainable growth and the market economy
*Promote a deeper understanding by policymakers, the media and the public at large of the benefits of global trade and investment

&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iccwbo.org/iccrf/id30984/index.html ICC Research Foundation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706101245/http://www.iccwbo.org/iccrf/id30984/index.html |date=July 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICC Research Foundation is governed by a board of trustees, who include Cherie Nursalim and Gerard Worms.[http://www.iccrf.org/people.html]

As such it is one of the [[Nomenclature Codes|nomenclature codes]] of [[biology]].

Originally the ''[[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]]'' dealt with bacteria, and this kept references to bacteria until these were eliminated at the 1975 [[International Botanical Congress|IBC]]. An early Code for the nomenclature of bacteria was approved at the 4th International Congress for Microbiology in 1947, but was later discarded.

The latest version to be printed in book form is the 1990 Revision,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=icnb.section.185 ''Bacteriological Code (1990 Revision)'']&lt;/ref&gt; but the book does not represent the current rules, as the Code has been amended since (these changes have been published in the  ''[[International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology]]'' (''IJSEM'')).&lt;ref name=Sneath/&gt; The rules are maintained by the [[International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes]] (ICSP; formerly the International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology, ICSB).

The base-line for bacterial names is the Approved Lists&lt;ref&gt;VBD Skerman, Vicki McGowan, and PHA Sneath, 1989. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=bacname ''Approved Lists of Bacterial Names, Amended edition''] Washington (DC): [[ASM Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; with a starting point of 1980. New bacterial names are reviewed by the ICSP as being in conformity with the Rules of Nomenclature and published in the ''IJSEM''.

As of 2011, the formal separation of the botanical and bacteriological codes continues to cause problems with the nomenclature of certain groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Oren, A.|year=2011|title=Cyanobacterial systematics and nomenclature as featured in the International Bulletin of Bacteriological Nomenclature and Taxonomy / International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology / International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology|journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology|volume=61|issue=1|pages=10–15|url=http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/61/1/10.abstract|doi=10.1099/ijs.0.018838-0|pmid=21097637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6972">'''Intra-industry trade''' refers to the exchange of similar products belonging to the same industry. The term is usually applied to [[international trade]], where the same types of goods or services are both imported and exported.

==Examples==
Examples of this kind of trade include [[automobile]]s, foodstuffs and [[beverage]]s, computers and minerals.

Europe exported 2.6 million motor vehicles in 2002, and imported 2.2 million of them. Japan exported 4.7 million vehicles in 2002 (1 million of which went to Europe, and 2 million to North America), and imported 0.3 million.

==Explanation==
Why do countries at the same time import and export the products of the same industry, or import and export the same kinds of goods?

According to Nigel Grimwade, "An explanation cannot be found within the framework of classical or neo-classical trade theory. The latter predicts only inter-industry specialisation and trade".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Grimwade |first=Nigel |title=International Trade: New Patterns of Trade, Production &amp; Investment |edition=Second |year=2000 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |page=71 |isbn=0-415-15626-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is far from the case.

The traditional model of trade were set out by the model of [[David Ricardo]] and the [[Heckscher–Ohlin model]], which tried to explain the occurrence of [[international trade]]. Both models used the idea of [[comparative advantage]] and an explanation of why countries trade. However, many economists have made the point of claiming that these models provide no explanation towards intra-industry trade as under their assumptions countries with identical factor endowments would not trade and produce goods domestically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Krugman |first=Paul |last2=Obstfeld |first2=Maurice |year=1991 |title=International Economics: Theory and Policy |location=New York |publisher=Harper Collins |isbn=0-673-52151-6 |edition=Second }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence,  as intra-industry trade has developed many economists have looked at other explanations.

One attempt to explain IIT was made by Finger (1975), who thought that occurrence of intra-industry trade was “unremarkable” as existing classifications place goods of heterogeneous factor endowments in a single industry. However, evidence shows that even when industries are disaggregated to extremely fine levels IIT still occurs, so this argument can be ignored.

Another potential explanation is provided by Flavey &amp; Kierzkowski (1987). They produced a model that tried to get rid of the idea that all products are produced under identical technical conditions. Their model showed that on the [[demand|demand side]] goods are distinguished by the perceived quality of that good and high quality goods are produced under conditions of high capital intensity. However, this explanation has also been dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Brander |first=James A. |year=1987 |title=Book Review of Greenaway and Milner (1986) |journal=Journal of International Economics |volume=23 |issue=1/2 |pages=182–185 |doi=10.1016/S0022-1996(87)80013-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is questioned whether the model applies to IIT at all, as it does not address directly trade between goods of ''similar'' factor endowments.

The most comprehensive and widely accepted explanation, at least within economic theory, is that of [[Paul Krugman]]'s [[New Trade Theory]]. Krugman argues that economies specialise to take advantage of increasing returns, not following differences in regional endowments (as contended by [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] theory). In particular, trade allows countries to specialise in a limited variety of production and thus reap the advantages of increasing returns (i.e., [[economies of scale]]), but without reducing the variety of goods available for consumption.

Yet, [[Donald Davis (economist)|Donald Davis]] believed that both the Heckscher–Ohlin and Ricardian models were still relevant in explaining intra-industry trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Davis |first=D. R. |year=1995 |title=Intra-industry trade: A Heckscher-Ohlin-Ricardo approach |journal=Journal of International Economics |volume=39 |issue=3/4 |pages=201–226 |doi=10.1016/0022-1996(95)01383-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed the Heckscher-Ohlin-Ricardo model, which showed that even with constant returns to scale that intra-industry trade could still occur under the traditional setting. The Heckscher-Ohlin-Ricardo model explained that countries of identical factor endowments would still trade due to differences in technology, as this would encourage specialisation and therefore trade, in exactly the same matter that was set out in the Ricardian model.

;Types
There are three types of intra-industry trade
#Trade in Homogeneous Goods.
#Trade in Horizontally Differentiated Goods.
#Trade in Vertically Differentiated Goods.

Although the theory and measurement of intra-industry trade initially focused on trade in goods, especially industrial products, it has also been observed that there is substantial intra-industry trade in the international trade of services.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne, Robert C. ; Gonzales, Jorge (2004). "The Role of Intra-Industry Trade in the Service Sector", in Michael Plummer (ed.) ''Empirical Methods in International Trade: Essays in Honor of Mordechai Kreinin'', Edward Elgar Press, 110-128, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
Intra-industry trade is difficult to measure statistically because regarding products or industries as "the same" is partly a matter of definition and classification.

For a very simple example, it could be argued that although a [[BMW]] and a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] are both motor cars, and although a [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] and a [[Heineken]] are both beers, they are really all different products.

Various indexes of IIT have been created, including the [[Grubel–Lloyd index]], the [[Balassa index]], the [[Aquino index]], the [[Bergstrand index]] and the [[Glesjer index]]. Research suggests that

*IIT is not simply a fiction or artifact produced by statistical classifications and definitions, but very much a reality.
*the share of IIT in total international trade is growing all the time, at about 4–5% a year. Thus, more and more, countries are importing the same kinds of products they are also exporting.

"Intra-industry trade has been considered in international trade literature as the explanation of the unexpectedly large expansion of industrial trade among OECD countries, for which it represented more than two-thirds of their total international trade by the beginning of the seventies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Bela |last=Kadar |title=Review of Herbert Giersch, ''On the economics of intra-industry trade'' |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |volume=19 |issue=3 |year=1981 |pages=1109 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James A. Reed''' (born April 1963) is a British businessman, the [[Chairman#Public corporations|chairman]] and chief executive of the [[Reed (company)|Reed]] group of companies, which comprises Reed Specialist Recruitment, Reed Learning, Reed in Partnership and Reed Online. He is the son of [[Sir Alec Reed]], who founded the company in 1960.

==Education==
Reed attended [[Scaitcliffe]] prep school and [[St Paul's School, London|St Paul's]]. He graduated from [[Christ Church, Oxford]] in 1984 with a degree in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] (PPE,) and subsequently gained an [[MBA]] from the [[Harvard Business School]], where his father briefly joined him to study.

At Oxford, Reed was political editor of ''Samizdat'', a magazine for political science students. At Harvard he produced a case study and video about slum improvement works in [[Addis Ababa]], Ethiopia. Titled ''In The Shadow of The City'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=James Reed|author2=Anne Donnelon|author3=Nicholas Richardson|title=In the Shadow of the City|url=http://hbr.org/product/in-the-shadow-of-the-city/an/490093-PDF-ENG|website=''HBR.Org''|publisher=Harvard|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the case study was taught at Harvard and other Universities. Reed was travel editor of Harbus News, the Harvard Business School's student news organisation.

==Early career==
Reed's first job was in a cemetery, levelling graves at a burial site in Old Windsor. In an interview with [[The Independent]] newspaper in 2000 Reed said: "I got the job because an elderly lady asked my predecessor what he was doing digging up her husband's grave. He wasn't, but flippantly he said it was because her husband hadn't been paying the rates lately – and he got fired. It was miserable, it was cold, it was horrible and hard – and I didn't last very long at it." &lt;ref name="Independent newspaper interview 2000"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davies |first1=Clancy |title=Twenty Questions: James Reed, Chief Executive, Reed Executive |url=//www.independent.co.uk/student/postgraduate/mbas-guide/twenty-questions-james-reed-chief-executive-reed-exectutive-626185.html/ |website=The Independent |accessdate=30 July 2014 |date=22 November 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321205834/http://www.independent.co.uk/student/postgraduate/mbas-guide/twenty-questions-james-reed-chief-executive-reed-exectutive-626185.html/ |archivedate=21 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from Oxford in 1984, Reed sought to work for an entrepreneur. He wrote a speculative job application to [[Gordon Roddick|Gordon]] and [[Anita Roddick]] of the [[Body Shop]] plc. The couple subsequently employed him as assistant to then-chairman Gordon. Reed has described his time at the Body Shop as his transition from University to the world of work. He has cited Anita Roddick as an influence, saying: "If a bottle of jojoba hand lotion wasn't displayed properly on the shelf, she'd pull you up on it. And I really liked that — that combination of real drive and enthusiasm, and getting the details right."&lt;ref name="Recruiter interview"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doke|first1=DeeDee|title=Venturing into fresh fishing grounds|url=http://www.recruiter.co.uk/archive/part-27/Venturing-into-fresh-fishing-grounds|website=Recruiter|publisher=Redactive Publishing Limited|accessdate=29 July 2014|quote=She brought huge energy into her work and loved what she did. She also had incredible attention to detail.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1985–1986 Reed worked as a [[media planner]]/buyer for [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]] plc, where he planned and managed advertising campaigns for [[British Rail]], [[Club 18-30]], [[Eurotunnel]] and [[Procter and Gamble]].

From 1987 to 1988 Reed worked for [[Afghanaid]] and [[Help the Aged]], co-ordinating [[Disaster response|relief]] and [[International development|development]] programmes in [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]] and Soviet-occupied [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.managementtoday.co.uk/james-reed-man-took-recruitment-online/entrepreneurs/article/1441257|title=James Reed: The man who took recruitment online|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Afghanistan he established a village assistance programme for farmers affected by regional conflict, co-ordinated fundraising, publicity and sponsorship services for Afghanaid and reported on the Afghan conflict for [[The Independent]] newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reed|first1=James|title=How The Stinger has transformed the Afghan War|website=The Independent|date=23 December 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; To enter Afghanistan from Pakistan's border, Reed travelled disguised as an Afghan with a party of [[Mujahideen]] rebels.&lt;ref name="Week Ending"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Lyndsey|title=Behind Enemy Lines: Relief worker's close-up view of the Afghan war|accessdate=29 July 2014|date=22 April 1988|quote=One of the officers told me to wear Afghan clothes and a turban and pretend to be asleep on the bus...so that's what I did and it was quite easy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his graduation from Harvard in 1990, Reed began a two-year production course at the [[BBC]], where he worked as an Assistant Producer on documentaries and factual programmes. These included BBC TV's 'Business Matters', for which Reed produced ''Crazy Ways for Crazy Days'', a 50-minute documentary about management guru [[Tom Peters]], and ''The Pros and The Cons'', an inside view of [[private prison|prison privatisation]] at [[Strangeways]]. After the Tom Peters documentary grossed £1m, Reed requested funding to make a similar programme – but was turned down, leading him to grow dissatisfied with his employment at the BBC.&lt;ref name="ReedBevan2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alec Reed|author2=Judi Bevan|title=I Love Mondays: The autobiography of Sir Alec Reed CBE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D-4NXg8qpcEC|date=5 January 2012|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=1-84765-767-2|pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed became a non-executive director of Reed in 1992. In a 2014 radio interview, Reed spoke of the circumstances leading up to joining the family business full-time:&lt;ref name="Best of the guest Best of the guest Best of the guest Effori 2014"&gt;{{cite web | author=Best of the guest | author2=Best of the guest | author3=Best of the guest | last4=Effori | first4=Nilo | last5=Shapers | first5=Business | author6=Best of the guest | title=June 2014 | website=Business Shapers | date=2014-06-27 | url=https://businessshapers.co.uk/2014/06/ | access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Joining the family business wasn't a ''fait accompli''. When my father got to 60 he said 'James, there's not much point having a family business if there isn't anyone in the family in it, and I'm getting to the age where I have to think about these things'. I'd been sitting on the fence for some time. Then one day he said: ‘That job that I have been talking to you about? It’s going to be in [[The Sunday Times]] ''Appointments'' section next week – do you want to apply or not?" That got me off the fence! I was fearful of following him. He was a very successful entrepreneur who'd set up this business and he was well loved in the business. I was worried about failing. That fear of failure probably kept me on the fence for longer than it should have done.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reed Group==
Reed joined the [[Reed (company)|Reed Group]] full-time in April 1994, as director of operations. He became Chief executive in February 1997.&lt;ref name="Accountancy Magazine interview"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hirschkorn|first1=Jenny|title=Interview: A Family Affair|url=https://www.accountancylive.com/interview-family-affair|website=Accountancy Live|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|accessdate=29 July 2014|date=April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; To symbolise the handover of control of the company, Reed's father presented him with a conductor's baton mounted in a glass case. The baton now hangs on the wall of Reed's personal office at the company's headquarters in Covent Garden, London.&lt;ref name="Reed Bevan2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alec Reed|author2=Judi Bevan|title=I Love Mondays: The autobiography of Sir Alec Reed CBE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D-4NXg8qpcEC|date=5 January 2012|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=1-84765-767-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In press interviews, Reed is often asked to respond to the accusation that his appointment to the family business was an act of [[nepotism]]; he has consistently offered unqualified agreement. In a 2010 ''Guardian'' interview he said "There is no other way of describing it",&lt;ref name="Guardian Newspaper interview, 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Teather|first1=David|title=Alec and James Reed: recruitment is just the job for father and son|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jun/03/alec-james-reed-recruitment#start-of-comments|website=The Guardian|publisher=Scott Trust|date=3 June 2010|quote="It was quite a big deal for me. I was only 34 and it was a bit sooner than I had expected}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a 2013 interview with Associated Newspapers he said: ‘The family joke is that I had a 30-year interview and eventually got in’.&lt;ref name="This Is Money"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Owen|first1=Vicki|title=I don't like the zero hours deal either – but it's better than no work at all': James Reed on controversial pay plans|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2384105/James-Reed-speaks-controversial-zero-hour-contracts.html|website=Daily Mail|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=BLM interviews James Reed of Reed Recruitment|url=https://soundcloud.com/business-leader/blm-interviews-james-reed-of-reed-recruitment|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reed's father is quoted as believing that family-run businesses "...cut out a lot of company politics".&lt;ref name="BarrowBrown2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Colin Barrow|author2=Robert Brown|author3=Liz Clarke|title=The Business Enterprise Handbook|quote=You know the MD won't be headhunted|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fNLmmtAt1QMC|accessdate=4 August 2014|year=2004|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|isbn=978-0-7494-4100-5|page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reed succeeded his father to the position of chairman in 2004.&lt;ref name="HR Zone interview 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duff|first1=Charlie|title=James Reed: The three Rs - recruitment, retention and relationships|url=http://www.hrzone.com/topic/recruitment/james-reed-3-rs-recruitment-retention-and-relationships/104914|website=HR Zone|accessdate=30 July 2014|date=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed has said that he considers his three most significant contributions to the Reed Group to be the development of reed.co.uk, the advent of Reed in Partnership and the globalisation of the company.&lt;ref name="Interview with The Employable"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ten Minutes with….James Reed|url=http://www.theemployable.com/index.php/2012/01/24/ten-minutes-with-james-reed-chairman-of-reed/|accessdate=30 July 2014|date=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his leadership the company's turnover has grown from £150m to £1bn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/09/04/taking-ceo-make-success-succession/|title=Taking over from a CEO: How to make a success of succession|last=Christie|first=Sophie|date=2018-09-04|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-09-27|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2018 he was named to the ''Europe Staffing 100''  list of recruitment professionals, published by ''Staffing Industry Analysis.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://si100europe.staffingindustry.com/2018/08/james-reed-5/|title=James Reed|work=The Staffing 100 (Europe)|access-date=2018-09-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 the-then [[Paymaster General]] [[Geoffrey Robinson]] invited Reed to bid for the inaugural contracts issued by the newly elected [[Blair ministry|Blair Government]] which, as part of its [[New Deal (United Kingdom)|New Deal]] programme, saw some of the traditional work of [[Active labour market policies|Job Centres]] outsourced to the private sector. As of 2011, Reed in Partnership employed 900 staff. Reed has expanded the business into Poland and Australia.

===De-listing===
As chief executive, Reed delisted Reed Executive from the UK Stock Exchange in 2003, buying back the company for 140p per share, at a valuation of £62.6&amp;nbsp;million and at an 18% premium to the previous day's closing price. Shares in Reed Executive rose 15% following the announcement.&lt;ref name="Guardian Newspaper interview, 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="StockMarketWire April 2003"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reed Executive to go private|url=http://www.stockmarketwire.com/article/68181/Reed-Executive-to-go-private.html|website=''StockMarketWire.com''|accessdate=4 August 2014|date=4 April 2003|quote=Due to negative market sentiment towards smaller quoted companies and the increasing illiquidity of the Reed Ordinary Shares, the directors of James Reed &amp; Partners believe that the benefits to the company of maintaining its listing have been significantly eroded.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, some financial commentators suggested that the Reed family were taking advantage of a lull in the firm's share price, in the wake of both a cyclical downturn and the controversy over Reed's decision to spin off Reed Health.&lt;ref name=Citywire&gt;{{cite web|last1=George|first1=Jemma|title=Reed Executive jumps on MBO move|url=http://citywire.co.uk/money/reed-executive-jumps-on-mbo-move/a247309|website=''Citywire.co.uk''|accessdate=4 August 2014|date=4 April 2004|quote=There was nothing to suggest trading would improve in the short-term, which is in keeping with the message from others in the sector such as Robert Walters, Michael Page, PSD and Whitehead Mann...their share prices continue to languish at new lows creating opportunities for corporate action.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fall out from Reed Health sackings"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prynn|first1=Jonathan|title=Reed sackings put Sawyer on spot|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-1531726/Reed-sackings-put-Sawyer-on-spot.html|website=This is Money|accessdate=31 July 2014|date=2 December 2002|quote=In what is reckoned to be an unprecedented act...Alec Reed voted without warning to block the reappointment of chief executive Christa Echtle and finance director Desmond Doyle, effectively terminating their contracts on the spot. Echtle...believes Alec Reed intervened because of a resolution at the annual meeting to issue new shares to fund acquisitions. It is understood Alec Reed did not want a dilution of his controlling holding in the company.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later Reed would launch a £38m hostile takeover for Reed Health, following which the company eventually came back under the Reed family's control.

Reed stated that the firm was delisted because it no longer had need of outside capital. In his autobiography, Reed's father suggested that the de-listing was due in part to the publication of the [[Review of the role and effectiveness of non-executive directors|Higgs]] and [[Cadbury Report|Cadbury]] reports into public company governance, both of which called for wide-ranging restrictions upon directors and their appointments.&lt;ref name="ReedBevan2012"/&gt;

===reed.co.uk===
reed.co.uk was the first recruitment website offered by a recruitment agency in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=E-MAIL US YOUR CV, PLEASE|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/410511/UK-E-MAIL-US-CV-PLEASE/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH|website=Management Today|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It launched in 1995 with 40 vacancies. It now advertises over 200,000 vacancies a day. In interview, Reed has made light of the fact that the company's first website was suggested and built by a young IT contractor nicknamed "Pancake the Clown", after his sideline business as a children's entertainer. In a 2014 interview with JazzFM, Reed said: "The truth of the matter is, I got Pancake the Clown to build our first prototype"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Shapers – James Reed|url=http://businessshapers.co.uk/2014/06/|website=JazzFM|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed has also spoken of being "horrified" when a young member of staff suggested that the firm should open up its website to vacancies offered by rival recruitment firms. Reed would go on to approve the experiment; the scheme began in May 2000 and by November of the same year over 2000 rival firms had registered on the site. Reed would go on to credit the idea as being the foundation of the firm's online strategy; the junior staff member was paid a £100,000 bonus for his suggestion.&lt;ref name="Venturing into fresh fishing grounds"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doke|first1=DeeDee|title=Venturing into fresh fishing grounds|url=http://www.recruiter.co.uk/archive/part-27/Venturing-into-fresh-fishing-grounds/|website=''Recruiter.co.uk''|accessdate=31 July 2014|date=31 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed is a Fellow of the [[Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development]] (CIPD). He was formerly an Associate of the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit and a member of the [[Institute for Public Policy Research]] (IPPR)'s business-led Taskforce on Race Equality and Diversity in the Private Sector. In the run-up to the [[2010 general election (UK)|2010 general election]], Reed conducted public video-interviews with the three Parliamentary candidates nominated for the role of Secretary of State ([[Steve Webb]], [[Yvette Cooper]] and [[Theresa May]]), asking questions sent in by job hunters.&lt;ref name="Reed.co.uk Election interviews"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reed.co.uk Election interviews|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/reedvote2010|via=YouTube|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election]], Reed's cross-party interviews were conducted with [[Damian Hinds|Damien Hinds]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=reed.co.uk|title=Damian Hinds (Conservative) interviewed by James Reed|date=2017-06-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-Ax-62EJOo|accessdate=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Debbie Abrahams]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=reed.co.uk|title=Debbie Abrahams (Labour) interviewed by James Reed|date=2017-06-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9b0zZP_upk|accessdate=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Susan Kramer, Baroness Kramer|Baroness Kramer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=reed.co.uk|title=Baroness Kramer (Liberal Democrats) interviewed by James Reed|date=2017-06-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bazSVsQTRdg|accessdate=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television appearances==
Since 2008, Reed has been depicted in a series of humorous TV adverts featuring the actor and comedian [[Rufus Jones (actor)|Rufus Jones]]. Some of these adverts have been directed by the previous year's winners of Reed's annual Short Film Competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Street 40|quote=4m23s |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAW4pPeO9V4|via=YouTube|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adverts begin with Jones introducing himself as James Reed. Jones' portrayal of Reed is a knowingly [[over acting|over-acted]] caricature of a comic book superhero, one who has the [[superpower (ability)|superpower]] to transform job-hunters into their ideal vocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reed.co.uk launches major TV campaign|url=http://www.onrec.com/news/news-archive/reedcouk-launches-major-tv-campaign|website=''OnRec.com''|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one advert Reed makes a [[cameo appearance]] as an ice cream seller who is transformed into a nightclub DJ by the character of James Reed as played by Jones. The adverts have received more than 28 million YouTube views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/user/reedcouk/about|publisher = YouTube|title = Analytics for ReedOnline|accessdate = 21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 TV campaign sees Jones playing Reed as a comic knight.

Reed has made appearances in [[The Apprentice (UK series eleven)|Series 11]] and [[The Apprentice (UK series thirteen)|Series 13]] of BBC Television's [[The Apprentice (UK TV series)|The Apprentice]].

==Philanthropy==

Reed is a trustee of several Reed family charitable initiatives, including The Reed Foundation and [[The Big Give]] Trust. The Big Give was founded by James's father [[Alec Reed|Sir Alec Reed]] in 2007 and has helped to raise £82m for UK-registered charities.

===Grenfell Tower appeal===
Reed's family home in London is within sight of Grenfell Tower. After witnessing the Grenfell Tower fire at first hand, Reed set up a Big Give charity appeal which raised £1m within 48 hours of the fire breaking out. The appeal went on to raise £2.6m before being closed in September 2017. Reed donated £100,000 of his own money and The Reed Foundation donated a further £100,000, alongside donations made by members of the public, businesses and local organisations. The appeal's proceeds were donated to The K&amp;C Foundation. Reed has called for some of the appeal proceeds to be spent on an educational centre for residents of the area to learn coding and other digital skills, as part of a wider project to form a hub of digital companies in North Kensington.&lt;ref name="City Philanthropy 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Reed Chairman makes plea to push The Big Give matching fund for Grenfell Tower victims to £3m | website=City Philanthropy | date=22 June 2017 | url=http://www.cityphilanthropy.org.uk/news/reed-chairman-makes-plea-push-big-give-matching-fund-grenfell-tower-victims-%C2%A33m | access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UK Fundraising 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Big Give Grenfell appeal raises £2.6m: its biggest ever total for an individual cause | website=UK Fundraising | date=7 September 2017 | url=https://fundraising.co.uk/2017/09/07/big-give-grenfell-appeal-raises-2-6m-biggest-ever-total-individual-cause/ | access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

===''Put Your Mindset to Work''===
Coauthored by Reed and Harvard lecturer Paul G. Stoltz, ''Put Your Mindset to Work'' was published by [[Portfolio Penguin]] in May 2011. The book offers research data underlining the importance of employee mindset, citing that 97% of employers would put mindset ahead of skill set when recruiting. The book goes on to identify three elements of a competitive employment mindset, namely ''Global, Good'' and ''Grit'', which the authors summarise as "the 3G's". ''Global'' is said to measure an employee's ability to set their actions and decisions in a global context; ''Good'' refers to an employee's interpersonal sensitivity and a desire to do good for others; ''Grit'' references an employee's tenacity and intensity in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chynoweth|first1=Carly|title=Attitude is worth more than skills|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/public/Appointments/article643235.ece|website=''SundayTimes.co.uk''|accessdate=4 August 2014|date=6 June 2011|quote=Back in the worst days of the financial crisis in 2008 I went to a seminar and one of the speakers said 'the problem is we don't know what skills will be most in demand in 10 years'. I remember thinking 'no, of course we don't, but I do know the people I will want to hire', and it was all about mindset."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Put Your Mindset to Work'' was awarded the [[Chartered Management Institute|CMI]] Management Book of the Year Award in the Commuters' Read category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CMI: Management Book of the Year 2012 – Dame Mary Marsh|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra0lbx5IU7Q&amp;feature=youtu.be|via=YouTube|publisher=CMI|accessdate=4 August 2014|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book entered the ''USA Today'' best-seller list in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Put Your Mindset to Work|url=http://books.usatoday.com/book/james-reed-paul-g-stoltz-put-your-mindset-to-work/l31732|website=USA Today|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second edition of the work was published in August 2013, with jacket endorsements from [[Timpson (retailer)|Timpson]] CEO James Timpson, Gordon Roddick and management author Jim Kouzes.

===''Why You: 101 Interview Questions You'll Never Fear Again''===
Reed's second book with Penguin Portfolio features examples of interview questions and strategies for answering them, based on research obtained from Reed's network of hirers, recruiters and interviewees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why You? 101 WAYS TO SHINE AT INTERVIEW|url=http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780241970218,00.html|website=''Penguin.co.uk''|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The book's premise is that all interview questions are variations on just 15 distinct themes, referred to as "The Fateful Fifteen". Reed encourages candidates to relate all interview questions to these 15 themes, while cautioning against preparing canned answers in advance, arguing that this approach gets in the way of genuine and spontaneous conversation. 
 
Bookbag.co.uk awarded the title a "Highly Recommended" in its review section;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lesley Mason|title=Why You? 101 Interview Questions You'll Never Fear Again by James Reed|url=http://www.thebookbag.co.uk/reviews/index.php?title=Why_You%3F_101_Interview_Questions_You%27ll_Never_Fear_Again_by_James_Reed|website=''TheBookbag.co.uk''|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Notting Hill Post called the book "...essential reading"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mary-Lu Bakker|title=HOW TO BE A GOOD INTERVIEWEE … BUT DON'T FORGET YOUR SHIRT|url=http://nottinghillpost.com/news/james-reed/|website=The Notting Hill Post|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His hobbies are said to include running, riding and driving horses, football and mountaineering.&lt;ref name="Recruiter interview" /&gt; He has participated in two of Reed's annual Alpine Leadership Challenges led by the [[alpinist]] Stefan Gatt.

'''James Mwirigi Mworia''' is a [[Kenya]]n lawyer, accountant, and business executive. He is the managing director and chief executive officer of [[Centum Investments]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=13 June 2014| url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/ehed45lik/james-mworia-kenyan-chief-executive-officer-centum-investments/|title=James Mworia, Kenyan, Chief Executive Officer, Centum Investments|publisher=[[Forbes Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest publicly traded private capital firm in eastern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=13 June 2014|url=http://www.kenyanmagazines.com/james-mworia-ceo-centum-investments-the-business-of-investing-management-august-2010/| first=Brenda|last=Otindo|date=August 2010|title=James Mworia, CEO Centum Investments|publisher=Management Magazine via Kenyanmagazines.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has served in that capacity since 2008.

==Background and education==
Mworia was born in 1978. He attended Alliance High School, [[Strathmore University]], and the [[University of Nairobi]]. He has a [[Bachelor of Laws]] from Nairobi University. He is also a [[certified public accountant]] and a [[chartered financial analyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=13 June 2014| url=http://www.strathmore.edu/alumni/strathmore-taught-me-excellence-says-ceo/ |title=Strathmore Taught Me Excellence, Says CEO|
publisher=[[Strathmore University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work history==
In 2001, Mworia began working as a filing clerk at Centum Investments.

'''MaRS Discovery District''' is a not-for-profit corporation founded in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada in 2000. Its stated goal is to commercialize publicly funded medical research and other technologies with the help of local private enterprises and as such is a [[public-private partnership]].&lt;ref name="How did MaRS get started"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marsdd.com/aboutmars/story/ |title=How did MaRS get started |accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its mission MaRS says, "MaRS helps create successful global businesses from Canada's science, technology and social innovation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our mission, our vision {{!}} MaRS|url=http://www.marsdd.com/aboutmars/mission/|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{As of|2014}}, [[Startup company|startup companies]] emerging from MaRS had created more than 4,000 jobs, and in the period of 2011 to 2014 had raised over $750 million in [[capital investments]].&lt;ref name=philipiddis2014&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/incubators-blossom-along-with-their-startups/5245/|title=Incubators Blossom along with Their Startups|last=Philipiddis|first=Alex|date=15 June 2014|work=[[Gen.

The name MaRS was originally drawn from a file name, and later attributed with the title "Medical and Related Sciences." It has since abandoned this association&lt;ref name="How did MaRS get started"/&gt; as it also works in other fields such as [[information and communications technology]], [[engineering]], and [[social innovation]].

== Facilities ==

It is located on the corner of [[College Street (Toronto)|College Street]] and [[University Avenue (Toronto)|University Avenue]] in the city of Toronto’s [[Discovery District]], adjacent to the [[University of Toronto]] and its affiliated research hospitals at the [[University Health Network]].

The MaRS development consists of two phases.

=== Phase 1 ===
MaRS Discovery District Phase 1 was designed by Adamson Associates Architects and includes:

* The Heritage Building (formerly a wing of the [[Toronto General Hospital]]),
* The Atrium
* The South Tower
* The Toronto Medical Discovery Tower

====The Heritage Building====
Inside the Heritage Building's four-storey brick façade (preserved) are tenant spaces occupied by professional services, industry associations, pharmaceutical companies and offices of Canadian universities and the [[Province of Ontario]]. In 2006, the MaRS Centre received the Heritage Toronto Award of Excellence for Architectural Conservation and Craftsmanship. The building was designed by [[Pearson and Darling]] and opened in 1911.

====The Atrium====
The MaRS atrium is a glass-roofed public thoroughfare that provides walkway access to Heritage Building tenants and retail vendors, as well as access to the South and Medical Discovery Towers. Its bottom level features a sub-dividable conference area that hosts public and private events. MaRS encourages events from across Toronto's arts, culture and broader urban community. The Atrium's lower level also features a media centre, video conferencing rooms and a public food court.

====The South Tower====
This eight-storey structure houses incubator programs and shared laboratory and research facilities. The {{convert|200000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, wet-lab-capable building spans eight floors in the MaRS Centre. The tower boasts advanced mechanical and electrical systems, floors with enhanced load bearing capabilities and {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} slab-to-slab clearances.

Occupying the second and third floors of the South Tower — directly above the MaRS corporate offices, is the MaRS Incubator – a dedicated space that houses offices and laboratories for approximately two dozen life science and technology firms.

====Toronto Medical Discovery Tower====
With {{convert|400000|sqft|m2}} of state-of-the-art wet labs, the 15-storey Toronto Medical Discovery Tower accommodates leading-edge scientific equipment and houses the basic research activities of two of Canada's premier research hospitals: the University Health Network and the Hospital for Sick Children.

Situated on the corner of College and Elizabeth Street, the building was designed with typical research and development lab floors configured with a side core arrangement and sheathed in metal and glass. The tower portions rest on a three-storey limestone podium that aligns with the heights of the adjoining College Wing and the formal landscape forecourt that extends the full block.

The shell and core of the TMDT is designed to accommodate a full lab program based on 80 percent wet lab and 20 percent dry lab. The lab floors have been configured to maximize future flexibility. The mechanical and electrical rooms, power and communication distribution systems, general and special exhaust risers, floor drains and service zones, have been established to allow for fit-out by future tenants.

Phase 1 began operations in 2005.&lt;ref name="How did MaRS get started"/&gt;

=== West Tower ===
West Tower (formerly known as Phase 2), designed by Bregman + Hamann Architects, constitutes a {{convert|780000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} addition to the MaRS centre in the form of a 20-story tower on the complex’s west wing.  The tower was developed by [[Alexandria Real Estate Equities]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Construction began in late 2007, and was scheduled to be completed in spring 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marsdd.com/News/Press-Releases/2007/Alexandria-20070626.html MaRS Selects Alexandria Real Estate Equities to Expand the MaRS Centre in the Discovery District of Toronto.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705022315/http://www.marsdd.com/News/Press-Releases/2007/Alexandria-20070626.html |date=2008-07-05 }}. Accessed on: June 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, Phase 2 construction was put on hold due to the [[Late 2000s recession|economic downturn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.financialpost.com/news/story.html?id=970255 Toronto's MaRS project a step too far.

In 2011, construction of Phase 2 restarted. Phase 2 construction was expected to be completed in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marsdd.com/newsreleases/mars-centre-phase-2-set-for-completion-in-fall-2013-2/ MaRS Centre Phase 2 Set for Completion in Fall 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Phase 2 of the project was facing criticism because the [[Ontario Government|Government of Ontario]] provided a [[bailout]] for the organization which is facing difficulty leasing the floors. The [[Ontario Progressive Conservative Party]] was calling for a full accounting of MaRS Phase 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alex Bouitilier|title=Ontario Tories call for clarity on MaRS costs|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2014/05/30/ontario_tories_call_for_clarity_on_mars_costs.html|work=[[Toronto Star]]|publisher=TorStar Media|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By November 2016, 93% of the building had been leased, with the rest in negotiation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|author=Shelley White|title=The story of the West Tower|url=https://magazine.marsdd.com/the-story-of-the-west-tower-3e130b165c4e#|work=[[Toronto Star]]|publisher=MaRS Discovery District|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[IBM]] announced plans to join the finTech hub at MaRS.  The hub has financial services companies, including CIBC, Manulife and Moneris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/ibm-to-be-first-tech-tenant-in-torontos-mars-fintech-hub-will-focus-on-cognitive-technologies "IBM to be first technology tenant in Toronto’s MaRS discovery district’s fintech hub"]. ''Financial Post'', Alexandra Posadzki,  August 30, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Image:MaRSAtrium.jpg|200 px|thumb|Inside the MaRS Centre atrium.]]

In April 2010, criticism of the $471,874 salary collected by MaRS CEO Ilse Treurnicht in 2008 was raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Greg Boutin |title=Troubling Facts about MaRS Discovery District |url=http://www.growthtimes.com/2010/04/troubling-facts-about-mars-discovery-district-part-1-of-4/ |work=Growth Times |date=April 2010 |accessdate=September 27, 2010|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also criticized Liberal government-led funding, lack of accountability and rigor in measuring results, claims of public-private partnerships and the absence of visible minorities among MaRS's team of advisors.

On August 27, 2010, the [[National Post]] relayed some of these criticisms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Adam McDowell |title=Discovering life at MaRS: Toronto’s premier innovation district |work=[[National Post]]|date=August 27, 2010 |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/Discovering+life+MaRS+Toronto+premier+innovation+district/3452631/story.html |accessdate=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewed criticism was published in 2011, pointing in particular to the $100,000 increase in Treurnicht's salary, her $534,000 salary in 2010, and questioning the public and private funding of the Phase II expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Greg Boutin |title=CEO of MaRS got 22% raise (one month before Ontario wage freeze?), made $533K in 2010 |work=Growth Times |date=August 3, 2011|url=http://www.growthtimes.com/2011/08/ceo-of-mars-got-22-raise-one-month-before-ontario-wage-freeze-made-533k-in-2010|accessdate=August 5, 2011|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Toronto Sun]] published articles on the topic as well, questioning the high compensation levels at the charitable trust institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2011/08/02/salaries-increase-at-mars-discovery-district|author=Jonathan Jenkins |title=Salaries increase at MaRS Discovery District |work=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=August 2, 2011 |accessdate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manuel de Jesús Clouthier del Rincón''' (b.June 13, 1934 – d.October 1, 1989)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.memoriapoliticademexico.org/Biografias/CMJ34.html|title=Manuel Jesús Clouthier del Rincón|last=|first=|date=|website=Memoría Política de México|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/manuel-clouthier-carrillo/nacion/los-clouthier|title=Los Clouthier|last=|first=|date=April 20, 2018|work=El Universal|access-date=June 5, 2018|location=Mexico City}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Mexican agriculturalist, businessman and politician. His [[Mexican general election, 1988|1988 presidential campaign]] challenged the dominance of Mexico’s [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI party]] in the nation’s politics, with rhetoric and protests before, during and after the elections. Although officially coming in third, he remained a prominent political force in Mexico until his death in a car accident a year after the elections.
==Life==
Clouthier was born on June 13, 1934 in [[Culiacán]], [[Sinaloa]], Mexico to Manuel Clouther Martínez de Castro and María Cristina del Rincón Bernal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His family owned 30,000 hectares of land in the Culiacán Valley as the descendent of Jean Auguste Clouthier, a French-Canadian doctor who made his home there in 1850.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Chihuahua Journal; To Lay Waste a Dynasty: A 'Northern Barbarian'|last=Rohter|first=Larry|date=May 3, 1988|work=New York Times|access-date=|page=A4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became known to friends and family, and later as a political figure by the nickname “Maquio” which he got during childhood.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-02/news/mn-400_1_car-crash|title=Charismatic Mexican Politician Manuel Clouthier Dies in Car Crash|last=Miller|first=Marjorie|date=October 2, 1989|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent his early childhood in Culiacan, attending primary school at Colegio Cervantes. In 1942, his parents divorced and he moved with his mother and two brothers to [[Guadalajara]]. His mother remarried in Guadalajara, after which Manuel and his brother Marco Antonio were enrolled in the Instituto de Ciencias. Manuel was expelled from the school for bad behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1947, the boys’ father sent them to the United States to study middle school at the Brown Military Academy in Los Angeles. Clouthier left the school with the rank of first lieutenant. He then studied for a short time at the [[Black-Foxe Military Institute|Black Fox Military Institute]] in San Diego.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He returned to Mexico in 1951 to attend high school at [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Monterrey|Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Studies in Monterrey,]] going study a bachelors in [[agricultural engineering]] at the same campus, graduating in 1957. In 1956 and 1957, he played [[defensive tackle]] and was president of the Student Association of the school.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/2014/10/01/984595|title=Tuvo Maquío meteórica y brillante carrera política|last=Galarza|first=Gerardo|date=October 1, 2014|work=El Excelsior|access-date=June 5, 2018|location=Mexico City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, he married Leticia Carrillo. The couple had eleven children, six daughters and five sons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One of his sons committed suicide, prompting him to spend more time with his family.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During his political career, Clouthier was heavy set, with white hair and beard. He was often described as fiery, with a blunt and aggressive style, and took pride in talking straight, often crudely.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The newsweekly Proceso described him as “Businessman, Catholic, dynamic, vain, efficient, boastful, humorous, foulmouthed, aggressive, forthright, controversial…”&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Ard|first=Michael James|title=Transforming great party politics: The National Action Party and its role in Mexico's democratic transition|date=2001|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Virginia|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his son, “Maquío was raised in the social doctrine of the Catholic Church and believed that wealth created a social obligation. He believed in democracy, in the social economy of the market, respecting the dignity of the individual, in solidarity and in subsidiarity.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In his free time, he liked sports, singing, and playing poker and dominos.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Clouthier died on October 1, 1989 in a car accident on the Mexico City-Nogales highway (KM158+100) in Culiacan, while on the way to a rally for a PAN candidate for mayor of [[Mazatlán]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The car crashed with a truck loaded with fruit. Both occupants of Clouthier's car died instantly. The truck driver survived.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There were rumors that it was not an accident, with several farmworkers reporting a helicopter in the area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The family asked for an investigation to clarify what happened in the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Demandan a PGR investigar muerte del 'Maquio'|last=Martinez|first=Fernando|date=December 28, 1995|work=El Norte|access-date=|location=Monterrey|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of people attended Clouthier’s funeral at the [[Culiacán Cathedral|Culiacán cathedral]] including [[Dionisio Garza Sada]], [[Mauricio Fernández Garza]], [[Concepción Guadalupe Garza]], [[Ingrid Fiehn]], [[Fernando Canales Clariond|Fernando Canales]], [[Raúl Monter]], [[Alberto Fernández Ruiloba]], [[Javier Livas]], [[Rafael Rangel Sostmann]], [[Porfirio Muñoz Ledo]], [[Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas]], [[Luis H. Álvarez|Luís H. Álvarez]], [[Elías Villegas]], [[Vicente Fox]] and [[Fernando Gutiérrez Barrios]]. Clouthier is buried at the Jardines del Humaya cemetery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

His widow, Leticia Carrillo Cázarez, died in December of 2017 at age 84. Children, Rebeca, [[Tatiana Clouthier|Tatiana]] and [[Manuel Clouthier Carrillo|Manuel]] have since gone into politics, but not in his [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/politica/fallece-leticia-carrillo-viuda-de-manuel-j-clouthier-maquio|title=Fallece Leticia Carrillo, viuda de Manuel J. Clothier “Maquío”|last=Cabrera Martinez|first=Javier|date=December 15, 2017|work=El Universal|access-date=June 5, 2018|location=Mexico City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agro-industry career==
After graduating from Monterrey Tech, he worked for a time with Paul Williams in [[Mexicali]]. He then returned to Culiacan, where his father gave him seventy hectares of land to farm. Here he grew tomatoes, chili peppers, cucumbers and rice. Clouthier was successful with this, increasing his land holdings to 270 hectares and starting fourteen businesses in [[Intensive farming|agroindustry]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Political career before presidential run==
His success in business prompted his entry into politics. In 1969, he was elected president of the, Asociación de Agricultores del Río Culiacán. In 1971, he became the head of the Unión Nacional de Productores de Hortalizas. That same year, he founded the Comité de Caminos Vecinales and joined the Movimiento Familiar Cristiano.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1971, he was nominated as a PRI candidate to become the municipal president of Culiacán, but another candidate was chosen to run. From then on, Clouthier shifted his focus to opposing the agrarian policies of then president [[Luis Echeverría|Luís Echeverría]], who expropriated lands during the last months of his term. Clouthier organized opposition businessmen, connected with other in similar situations in other states. Although he did not lose any of his lands, he suffered other repercussions and other pressures from local and federal governments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Between 1974 and 1978 he headed the Consejo Coordinador Empresarial de Sinaloa. Although unknown at the time, he was instrumental in the founding of the newspaper El Noroeste with Enrique Murillo and Jorge del Rincón. By 1978, he had national recognition as a business and political leader.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1982, after the nationalization of the banks, he started the ''México a la libertad'' movement against authoritarianism, interventionism and increasing control of state of the economy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The bank situation also had the effect of turning him away from the ruling PRI party to an alternative.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By 1983, he had joined the PAN party, as its ideology was closest to his own, but did not publicly announce the affiliation until 1984.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Clouthier was instrumental in bringing in new blood to PAN in the 1980s, recruiting owners of small and medium-sized businesses. He also brought in support from women, with PAN organizing groups called “Damas de Clouthier” (Clothier’s Ladies).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Shirk|first=David A.|title=Democratization and party -building: The growing pains of Mexico's National Action Party|date=2000|degree=PhD|publisher=University of California, San Diego|url=|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1986, he was slated as the PAN candidate as governor of Sinaloa against [[Francisco Labastida|Francisco Labastido Ochoa]]. He lost but PAN did not accept the results.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  He introduced PAN to civil disobedience tactics, emboldened by events in the Philippines against the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] regime, bringing in Philippine activists to teach peaceful civil disobedience. This made this party more radical than that of the past.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These activities had repercussions in the press, with Clouthier and the PAN being branded as “the barbarians of the north”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, it became a point of pride with supports putting bumper stickers on their cars announcing themselves as northern barbarians.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
==Presidential campaign==
Clouthier launched his presidential candidacy in 1987 with PAN and was nominated by the party in November 1987, with 70% of the delegate vote.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; During his campaign, he toured Mexico with mobile home, with his wife and several of his children.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Clouthier was an effective campaigner and his rallies drew large and enthusiastic crowds.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As a stump speaker, he relied on a stock of earthy stories, puns, jokes, anecdotes and analogies to get his points across.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ending PRI’s dominance on the country’s politics became Clouthier’s main campaign theme, which also includes calls for greater personal freedom, less interference by the government in Mexico City and end to federal monopolies such as the printing of public school textbooks.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; He had appeal to traditional Catholics in the county. His candidacy was classified as be a new kind of right-wing population or new right for Mexico, distinguishing it from that of the [[Cristero War|Cristeros]] and Mexico anticommunists, with a broader message. It was not capitalist, more in line with the socialism of then [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

After a successful interview with journalist Ricardo Rocha, the government-controlled media outlets blacked him out. In response, Clouthier organized a boycott of [[Jacobo Zabludovsky|Jacobo Zabludousky]]'s show “24 Horas” to protest the lack of opportunities for opposition candidates. He also protested the media lockout by holding silent rallies, in which he appeared with his mouth taped shut.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

PRI announced on 7 July that its candidate had won the presidential election. At the Federal Electoral Commission a PAN official got a hold of a computer file with the real returns and when discovered, was evicted. The computer crashed and the final results were withheld for a week. Both Clouthier and PRD candidate Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas declared the election results illegitimate. Clouthier signed a document pledging to not accept the PRI victory, but neither would he acknowledge that Cárdenas probably won.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Clouthier and PAN affiliates took the streets in protest in Mexico City, including a rally to the [[Angel of Independence]] that drew about 20,000 people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Clouthier also started a public hunger strike as the same monument, not eating for 177 hours from the 15th to 22nd of December of 1988. After the end of the strike, a pro-government newspaper ran the headline “Maquio Ends Diet.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;   Salinas was confirmed as president but after weeks of vote recount, PRI recognized that PAN had won 101 seats in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|Chamber of Deputies]], a record for the party.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Clouthier remained a prominent figure even after his loss (placing third), until his death.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In February 1989, Clouthier presented his “shadow cabinet” to monitor government actions in certain important areas. The cabinet proposed its own solutions to national issues. Clouthier was the coordinator of the cabinet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Mihailo "Miša" Anastasijević''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Миша Анастасијевић}}; February 24, 1803 – January 27, 1885) was the second richest man in [[Serbia]] in the 19th century, through his successful salt export from [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] and business partnership with the richest, [[Miloš Obrenović I, Prince of Serbia]]. He was also the ''Captain of Danube'', and acquired significant benefits from Prince Miloš. He was the first public benefactor in [[Serbia]] and organizer of various balls for the [[Belgrade]] [[bourgeoisie]].

==Life==
He was born in Poreč, modern [[Donji Milanovac]], Serbia. His father, Anastas, was a landowner and petty businessman. His mother, Ruža, was a homemaker. His stepmother Milja took care of him after his father's death. Miša and Milja twice crossed the Danube into Austria during the [[First Serbian Uprising]] of the [[Serbian Revolution]]. At 11 years, he was a teacher in his hometown, because he could read and write.

He was a business partner of [[Miloš Obrenović I, Prince of Serbia]], notably the richest. At the age of thirty he received the military title of Danube Captain and at the same time has acquired significant commercial benefits from Prince Miloš. His company soon gained control over salt exports from [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]]. At the top of his career, Miša Anastasijević employed circa 10,000 workers and had a fleet of 80 ships. He was the first public benefactor in [[Serbia]] and organizer of various balls for the [[Belgrade]] [[bourgeoisie]].

Anastasijević was called the “Prince of Danube” or “Danube [[Rothschild]]” for his wealth and business skills. Captain Miša Anastasijević married his daughter to a Prince from the ruling [[Karađorđević]] family and built the most impressive building in the city ([[Captain Miša’s Mansion]]), which was supposed to be the new court, although this plan failed. The building hosted almost every important educational and cultural institutions of the [[Principality of Serbia]] - Ministry of Education, the [[University of Belgrade#History|Belgrade Higher School]], which became the [[University of Belgrade]], [[First Belgrade Gymnasium]], [[National Museum of Serbia|National Museum]], Art Gallery and Library. Occasionally, its gala hall has been used for the meetings of the [[National Assembly of Serbia|National Assembly]] (1864–1875) and Senate (1901–1903). Today, there is the Rectorate of the [[University of Belgrade]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2891">'''On-ramping''' is the process of re-entering the [[workforce]] after taking a [[career break]] (usually to care for family). It is paired with the term "off-ramping", or exiting the workforce as a temporary career break.

The Hidden Brain Drain, a taskforce led by economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett, defined the term as "many professional women in the US do not drop out of their careers altogether, but they do take breaks. However, they often find it difficult to re-enter the workforce. This has been called 'off-ramping' (taking time out of a career for one reason or another) and 'on-ramping' (rejoining the career path). Women in the US, on average, spend a relatively short amount of time off-ramped (around 2.2 years), but even this can incur financial penalties. Women who spend around three years off-ramp see their earning power decrease by 37 per cent." &lt;ref name="EAH"/&gt; A study by the Center for Work-Life Policy found that more than 90 percent of those women who off-ramp eventually wish to on-ramp back into the work force.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Hannah Seligson |title=Off Ramp to On Ramp: It Can Be a Hard Journey |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/jobs/07return.html |work=[[NY Times]] |date=2008-12-06 |accessdate=2012-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term appears as early as 2005,&lt;ref name="WCS"/&gt; reaching public mention on [[NPR]]
&lt;ref name="MAR"/&gt; that same year. The term appears in articles in publications such as the [[Wall Street Journal]] &lt;ref name="SSW"/&gt; by 2006,
and by 2008 appears in formal training materials for organizations such as the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] &lt;ref name="WLW"/&gt; as a business [[best practice]].

Sylvia Ann Hewlett, as the likeliest originator of the term (in Hewlett &amp; Luce (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1482">'''Onno Jacobs''' (born 1964, [[Bleiswijk]]) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] business man and former Director Finance and Operations of [[Feyenoord Rotterdam]]. In January 2016 he was appointed as Interim Director of [[FC Twente]].

==Information==
He was appointed in August 2005 as the replacement of Jan Willem van Dop. Prior to his spell at Feyenoord Jacobs was director Finance and IT at CSM/PURAC, a company with over 300 million [[euro]]s [[revenue]]. Jacobs supported Feyenoord since he was a kid and is one of the founders of the Feyenoord talent pools that helped the club to restructure after chairman [[Jorien van den Herik]] was forced to resign in December 2006. 

Lately Jacobs was criticized by many Feyenoord supporters for not being able to solve the financial problems of the club. Many say Jacobs is a part of the problem and even made the situation worse by bad financial management. Jacobs announced that he will leave Feyenoord at the end of 2011.

'''Operations management''' is an area of [[management]] concerned with designing and controlling the process of [[production (economics)|production]] and redesigning [[business operations]] in the production of [[good (economics)|good]]s or [[service (economics)|services]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operationsacademia.org OperationsAcademia.org: The state-of-the-art of PhD research in Operations Research/Management Science and related disciplines] Retrieved on October 22, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the responsibility of ensuring that [[business]] operations are [[efficiency|efficient]] in terms of using as few resources as needed and [[Effectiveness|effective]] in terms of meeting customer requirements. Operations management is primarily concerned with planning, organizing and supervising in the contexts of production, manufacturing or the provision of services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.topmba.com/mba-programs/what-operations-management|title=What is Operations Management?|date=2014-04-30|work=TopMBA.com|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is concerned with managing an entire production system which is the process that converts inputs (in the forms of [[raw material]]s, [[Manual labour|labor]], and [[energy]]) into outputs (in the form of goods and/or services), as an asset or delivers a product or services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aqmauditing.com/what-is-operations-management.png Great Operations: What is Operations Management] Retrieved on July 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Operations produce products, manage quality and creates service. Operation management covers sectors like banking systems, hospitals, companies, working with suppliers, customers, and using technology. Operations is one of the major functions in an organization along with supply chains, marketing, finance and human resources. The operations function requires management of both the strategic and day-to-day production of goods and services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:LongBeachFord.jpg|thumb|right|Ford Motor car assembly line: the classical example of a manufacturing production system.]]In managing manufacturing or service operations several types of decisions are made including operations strategy, product design, process design, quality management, capacity, facilities planning, production planning and  inventory control.

==History==

The history of production and operation systems began around 5000 B.C. when [[Sumer]]ian priests developed the ancient system of recording inventories, loans, taxes, and business transactions.  The next major historical application of operation systems occurred in 4000 B.C.  It was during this time that the [[Egyptians]] started using [[planning]], [[organization]], and [[control (management)|control]] in large [[projects]] such as the construction of the pyramids. By 1100 B.C., labor was being specialized in [[China]]; by about 370 B.C., [[Xenophon]] described the advantages of dividing the various operations necessary for the production of shoes among different individuals in [[ancient Greece]]:&lt;ref&gt;Friedrick Klemm, A history of Western Technology, Charles Scribner's Sons 1959 in D. A. Wren and A. G. Bedeian, The Evolution of Management Thought, Wiley 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, [[Cyropedia]], Book VIII, Delphi Classics&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"...In large cities, on the other hand, inasmuch as many people have demands to make upon each branch of industry, one trade alone, and very often even less than a whole trade, is enough to support a man: one man, for instance, makes shoes for men, and another for women; and there are places even where one man earns a living by only stitching shoes, another by cutting them out, another by sewing the uppers together, while there is another who performs none of these operations but only assembles the parts. It follows, therefore, as a matter of course, that he who devotes himself to a very highly specialized line of work is bound to do it in the best possible manner."}}

[[File:Shoemaker Book of Trades.png|thumb|200px|[[Shoemaker]]s, 1568]]

In the [[Middle Ages]], kings and queens ruled over large areas of land.  Loyal noblemen maintained large sections of the monarch’s territory.  This hierarchical organization in which people were divided into classes based on social position and wealth became known as the [[Feudalism|feudal system]].  In the feudal system, [[vassal]]s and [[Serfdom|serfs]] produced for themselves and people of higher classes by using the ruler’s land and resources. Although a large part of labor was employed in agriculture, [[artisans]] contributed to economic output and formed [[guilds]]. The guild system, operating mainly between 1100 and 1500, consisted of two types: merchant guilds, who bought and sold goods, and craft guilds, which made goods. Although guilds were regulated as to the quality of work performed, the resulting system was rather rigid, [[shoemakers]], for example, were prohibited from tanning hides.&lt;ref&gt;[[D. A. Wren]] and [[A. G. Bedeian]], The Evolution of Management Thought, Wiley 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Services were also performed in the Middle Ages by servants. They provided service to the nobility for cooking, cleaning and entertainment.  Court jesters were service providers.  The medieval army could also be considered a service since they defended the nobility.

The [[industrial revolution]] was facilitated by two elements: interchangeability of parts and division of labor. [[Division of labor]] has always been a feature from the beginning of [[civilization]], the extent to which the division is carried out varied considerably depending on period and location. Compared to the Middle Ages, the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Discovery]] were characterized by a greater specialization in labor, one of the characteristics of growing European cities and trade. It was in the late eighteenth century that [[Eli Whitney]] popularized the concept of [[interchangeable parts|interchangeability of parts]] when he manufactured 10,000 muskets. Up to this point in the history of manufacturing, each product (e.g. each gun) was considered a special order, meaning that parts of a given gun were fitted only for that particular gun and could not be used in other guns.  Interchangeability of parts allowed the mass production of parts independent of the final products in which they would be used.

In 1883, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] introduced the [[stopwatch]] method for accurately measuring the time to perform each single task of a complicated job. He developed the scientific study of productivity and identifying how to coordinate different tasks to eliminate wasting of time and increase the quality of work.  The next generation of scientific study occurred with the development of [[work sampling]] and [[predetermined motion time systems]] (PMTS).  Work sampling is used to measure the random variable associated with the time of each task.  PMTS allows the use of standard predetermined tables of the smallest body movements (e.g. turning the left wrist by 90°), and integrating them to predict the time needed to perform a simple task.  PMTS has gained substantial importance due to the fact that it can predict work measurements without observing the actual work.  The foundation of PMTS was laid out by the research and development of [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.|Frank B.]] and [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|Lillian M. Gilbreth]] around 1912.  The Gilbreths took advantage of taking motion pictures at known time intervals while operators were performing the given task.

Service Industries: At the turn of the twentieth century, the services industries were already developed, but largely fragmented.  In 1900 the U.S. service industry consisted of banks, professional services, schools, general stores, railroads and telegraph. Services were largely local in nature (except for railroads and telegraph) and owned by entrepreneurs and families.  The U.S. in 1900 had 31% employment in services, 31% in manufacturing and 38% in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/cwc/american-labor-in-the-20th-century.pdf|title=American Labor in the 20th Century|last=Fisk, Donald M.|first=|date=2003-01-30|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the [[production line]] has been used multiple times in history prior to Henry Ford: the [[Venetian Arsenal]] (1104); Smith's pin manufacturing, in the [[Wealth of Nations]] (1776) or Brunel's [[Portsmouth Block Mills]] (1802). [[Ransom Olds]] was the first to manufacture cars using the assembly line system, but [[Henry Ford]] developed the first auto assembly system where a car chassis was moved through the assembly line by a [[conveyor belt]] while workers added components to it until the car was completed. During World War II, the growth of computing power led to further development of efficient manufacturing methods and the use of advanced mathematical and statistical tools. This was supported by the development of academic programs in [[Industrial engineering|industrial]] and [[systems engineering]] disciplines, as well as fields of operations research and management science (as multi-disciplinary fields of problem solving). While [[systems engineering]] concentrated on the broad characteristics of the relationships between inputs and outputs of generic systems, operations researchers concentrated on solving specific and focused problems. The synergy of [[operations research]] and systems engineering allowed for the realization of solving large scale and complex problems in the modern era. Recently, the development of faster and smaller computers, [[Artificial intelligence|intelligent systems]], and the [[World Wide Web]]  has opened new opportunities for operations, manufacturing, production, and service systems.

===Industrial Revolution===

[[File:Marshall's flax-mill, Holbeck, Leeds - interior - c.1800.jpg|thumb|right|Marshall's [[flax]] mill in [[Holbeck]]. The textile industry is the prototypical example of the English industrial revolution. ]]
{{See also|Industrial Revolution|Productivity improving technologies (historical)}}

Before the [[First industrial revolution]] work was mainly done through two systems: [[domestic system]] and [[craft guilds]]. In the domestic system [[merchants]] took materials to homes where artisans performed the necessary work, craft guilds on the other hand were associations of [[artisans]] which passed work from one shop to another, for example: leather was tanned by a [[tanner (occupation)|tanner]], passed to [[curriers]], and finally arrived at [[shoemakers]] and [[saddle]]rs.

The beginning of the industrial revolution is usually associated with 18th century English [[textile industry]], with the invention of [[flying shuttle]] by [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] in 1733, the [[spinning jenny]] by [[James Hargreaves]] in 1765, the [[water frame]] by [[Richard Arkwright]] in 1769 and the [[steam engine]] by [[James Watt]] in 1765.
In 1851 at the [[Crystal Palace Exhibition]] the term [[American system of manufacturing]] was used to describe the new approach that was evolving in the [[United States of America]] which was based on two central features: [[interchangeable parts]] and extensive use of [[mechanization]] to produce them.

===Second Industrial Revolution and post-industrial society===

Henry Ford was 39 years old when he founded the [[Ford Motor Company]] in 1903, with $28,000 capital from twelve investors. The [[model T]] car was introduced in 1908, however it was not until Ford implemented the assembly line concept, that his vision of making a popular car affordable by every middle-class American citizen would be realized. The first factory in which [[Henry Ford]] used the concept of the [[assembly line]] was [[Highland Park Ford Plant|Highland Park]] (1913), he characterized the system as follows:
{{quote|"The thing is to keep everything in motion and take the work to the man and not the man to the work. That is the real principle of our production, and [[conveyors]] are only one of many means to an end"&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Ford]], Today and Tomorrow, New York, 1926&lt;/ref&gt; }}
This became one the central ideas that led to [[mass production]], one of the main elements of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]], along with emergence of the [[electrical industry]] and [[petroleum industry]].

The post-industrial economy was noted in 1973 by Daniel Bell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The coming of the post-industrial society: a venture in social forecasting|last=Bell, Daniel|first=|publisher=Basic Books|year=1973|isbn=978-0465012817|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He stated that the future economy would provide more GDP and employment from services than from manufacturing and have a great effect on society. Since all sectors are highly interconnected, this did not reflect less importance for manufacturing, agriculture, and mining but just a shift in the type of economic activity.

=== Operations management ===
Although productivity benefited considerably from technological inventions and division of labor, the problem of systematic measurement of performances and the calculation of these by the use of formulas remained somewhat unexplored until Frederick Taylor, whose early work focused on developing what he called a "differential piece-rate system"&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Frederick Winslow (1896), A Piece Rate System, read before the American Society of Mechanical Engineers http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/107/109902/ch17_a3_d2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of experiments, measurements and formulas dealing with [[machining|cutting metals]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Taylor, F. W.]], On the Art of Cutting Metals, American society of Mechanical Engineers (1906)&lt;/ref&gt; and manual labor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Taylor, F. W.]], Shop management (1903), a handbook read before the American society of mechanical engineers, New York (this has been republished in 1911 https://archive.org/details/shopmanagement00taylgoog)&lt;/ref&gt; The differential [[piece-rate system]] consisted in offering two different pay rates for doing a job: a higher rate for workers with high productivity (efficiency) and who produced high quality goods (effectiveness) and a lower rate for those who fail to achieve the standard. One of the problems Taylor believed could be solved with this system, was the problem of [[soldiering]]: faster workers reducing their production rate to that of the slowest worker.
In 1911 Taylor published his "The Principles of Scientific Management",&lt;ref&gt;[[Taylor, Frederick Winslow]] (1911). The Principles of Scientific Management. New York, NY, US and London, UK: Harper &amp; Brothers. LCCN 11010339. OCLC 233134. Also available from Project Gutenberg.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he characterized [[scientific management]] (also known as [[Taylorism]]) as:
# The development of a true [[science]];
# The scientific selection of the [[worker]];
# The scientific education and development of the worker;
# Intimate friendly [[cooperation]] between the management and the workers.

Taylor is also credited for developing stopwatch time study, this combined with [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth|Frank]] and [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|Lillian]] Gilbreth motion study gave way to [[time and motion study]] which is centered on the concepts of standard method and [[Standard time (manufacturing)|standard time]]. Frank Gilbreth is also responsible for introducing the [[flow process chart]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Lillian Moller Gilbreth (1921) ''[http://openlibrary.org/books/OL24983025M/Process_charts Process Charts]. American Society of Mechanical Engineers.&lt;/ref&gt; Other contemporaries of Taylor worth remembering are [[Morris Cooke]] (rural electrification in the 1920s and implementer of Taylor's principles of scientific management in the Philadelphia's Department of Public Works), [[Carl Barth]] (speed-and-feed-calculating slide rules ) and [[Henry Gantt]] (Gantt chart). Also in 1910 [[Hugo Diemer]] published the first [[industrial engineering]] book: Factory Organization and Administration.

In 1913 [[Ford Whitman Harris]] published his "How many parts to make at once" in which he presented the idea of the [[economic order quantity]] model. He described the problem as follows:
{{quote|"[[Interest]] on capital tied up in [[wages]], material and [[overhead (business)|overhead]] sets a maximum limit to the quantity of parts which can be profitably manufactured at one time; "[[setup cost]]s" on the job fix the minimum. Experience has shown one manager a way to determine the economical size of lots"&lt;ref name="jstor170962"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = Ford W. | year = 1990|origyear= Reprint from 1913 | title = How Many Parts to Make at Once | journal = Operations Research | volume = 38 | issue = 6 | pages = 947–950  | publisher = INFORMS | jstor = 170962 | url = http://userhome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/irudowsky/CIS10.31/articles/EOQModel-OriginalPaper.pdf | accessdate = Nov 21, 2012 | doi=10.1287/opre.38.6.947}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This paper inspired a large body of mathematical literature focusing on the problem of [[production planning]] and [[inventory control]].

In 1924 [[Walter Shewhart]] introduced the [[control chart]] through a technical memorandum while working at [[Bell Labs]], central to his method was the distinction between [[common cause and special cause]] of variation. In 1931 Shewhart published his Economic Control of Quality of Manufactured Product,&lt;ref&gt;[[Shewhart, Walter Andrew]], Economic control of quality of manufactured product, 1931, New York: D. Van Nostrand Company. pp. 501 p.. {{ISBN|0-87389-076-0}} (edition 1st). LCCN 132090. OCLC 1045408. LCC TS155 .S47.&lt;/ref&gt; the first systematic treatment &lt;ref name="Montgomery"&gt;D.C. Montgomery, ''Statistical Quality Control: A Modern Introduction'', 7th edition 2012&lt;/ref&gt; of the subject of [[Statistical Process Control]] (SPC).

In the 1940s [[methods-time measurement]] (MTM) was developed by H.B. Maynard, JL Schwab and GJ Stegemerten. MTM was the first of a series of [[predetermined motion time systems]], predetermined in the sense that estimates of time are not determined in loco but are derived from an industry standard. This was explained by its originators in a book they published in 1948 called "Method-Time Measurement".&lt;ref&gt;H.B. Maynard, J.L. Schwab, G.J. Stegemerten, Methods Time Measurement, McGraw-Hill 1948 http://www.library.wisc.edu/selectedtocs/ca1794.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to this point in history, [[optimization]] techniques were known for a very long time, from the simple methods employed by F.W.Harris to the more elaborate techniques of the [[calculus of variations]] developed by [[Euler]] in 1733 or the [[Lagrange multipliers|multipliers]] employed by [[Lagrange]] in 1811, and [[computers]] were slowly being developed, first as [[analog computers]] by [[Sir William Thomson]] (1872) and [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]] (1876) moving to the eletromechanical computers of [[Konrad Zuse]] (1939 and 1941). During [[World War II]] however, the development of [[mathematical optimization]] went through a major boost with the development of the [[Colossus computer]], the first electronic digital computer that was all programmable, and the possibility to computationally solve large [[linear programming]] problems, first by [[Kantorovich]]&lt;ref&gt;L. V. Kantorovich, Mathematical Methods of Organizing and Planning Production, Management Science 1960 [English translation from 1939]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1939 working for the [[Soviet government]] and latter on in 1947 with the [[simplex method]] of [[George Dantzig|Dantzig]]. These methods are known today as belonging to the field of [[operations research]].

From this point on a curious development took place: while in the United States the possibility of applying the computer to business operations led to the development of management software architecture such as [[Material requirements planning|MRP]] and successive modifications, and ever more sophisticated optimization techniques and [[Simulation#Production|manufacturing simulation]] software, in post-war Japan a series of events at Toyota Motor led to the development of the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS) and [[Lean Manufacturing]].

In 1943, in Japan, [[Taiichi Ohno]] arrived at [[Toyota Motor]] company. Toyota evolved a unique manufacturing system centered on two complementary notions: [[just in time (business)|just in time]] (produce only what is needed) and [[autonomation]] (automation with a human touch). Regarding JIT, Ohno was inspired by American [[supermarkets]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Taiichi Ohno]], Toyota Production System, Productivity Pres 1988&lt;/ref&gt; workstations functioned like a supermarket shelf where the customer can get products they need, at the time they need and in the amount needed, the workstation (shelf) is then restocked. Autonomation was developed by [[Toyoda Sakichi]] in Toyoda Spinning and Weaving: an automatically activated loom that was also foolproof, that is automatically detected problems. In 1983 J.N Edwards published his "MRP and Kanban-American style" in which he described JIT goals in terms of seven zeros:&lt;ref&gt;J. N. Edwards, MRP and Kanban-American style, APICS 26th Conference Proceedings, pp586-603 1983&lt;/ref&gt; zero defects, zero (excess) lot size, zero setups, zero breakdowns, zero handling, zero lead time and zero surging. This period also marks the spread of [[Total Quality Management]] (TQM) in Japan, ideas initially developed by American authors such as [[W. Edwards Deming|Deming]], [[Joseph M. Juran|Juran]] and [[Armand V. Feigenbaum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=[[Armand V. Feigenbaum|Feigenbaum]] |first=Armand Vallin |year=1961 |title=Total Quality Control |publisher=McGraw-Hill |oclc=250573852}}&lt;/ref&gt; TQM is a strategy for implementing and managing quality improvement on an organizational basis, this includes: participation, work culture, customer focus, supplier quality improvement and integration of the quality system with business goals.&lt;ref name="Montgomery"/&gt;  Schnonberger&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Schnonberger, Japanese Manufacturing Techniques:Nine Hidden Lessons in Simplicity, New York 1982&lt;/ref&gt; identified seven fundamentals principles essential to the Japanese approach:
# Process control: [[Statistical process control|SPC]] and worker responsibility over quality
# Easy able -to-see quality: boards, gauges, meters, etc. and [[poka-yoke]]
# Insistence on compliance: "quality first"
# Line stop: stop the line to correct quality problems
# Correcting one's own errors: worker fixed a defective part if he produced it
# The 100% check: automated inspection techniques and foolproof machines
# Continual improvement: ideally zero defects

Meanwhile, in the sixties, a different approach was developed by George W. Plossl and Oliver W. Wight,&lt;ref name="Grubb"&gt;R.B. Grubbström, Modelling production opportunities - an historical overview, Int. J. Production Economics 1995&lt;/ref&gt; this approach was continued by Joseph Orlicky as a response to the TOYOTA Manufacturing Program which led to [[Material Requirements Planning]] (MRP) at [[IBM]], latter gaining momentum in 1972 when the American Production and Inventory Control Society launched the "MRP Crusade". One of the key insights of this management system was the distinction between [[dependent demand]] and [[independent demand]]. Independent demand is demand which originates outside of the production system, therefore not directly controllable, and dependent demand is demand for components of final products, therefore subject to being directly controllable by management through the [[bill of materials]], via [[product design]]. Orlicky wrote "Materials Requirement Planning"  in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;Orlickly, Materials Requirement Planning, McGraw-Hill 1975&lt;/ref&gt; the first hard cover book on the subject.&lt;ref name="Grubb"/&gt; [[MRP II]] was developed by Gene Thomas at IBM, and expanded the original MRP software to include additional production functions. [[Enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) is the modern software architecture, which addresses, besides production operations, [[Distribution (business)|distribution]], [[accounting]], [[human resources]] and [[procurement]].

Dramatic changes were occurring in the service industries, as well.  Beginning in 1955 [[McDonald's]] provided one of the first innovations in service operations.  McDonald's is founded on the idea of the production-line approach to service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levitt, Theodore|first=|year=1972|title=The Production-Line Approach to Services|url=|journal=Harvard Business Review|volume=50 |issue=4|pages=41–52|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This requires a standard and limited menu, an assembly-line type of production process in the back-room, high customer service in the front-room with cleanliness, courtesy and fast service. While modeled after manufacturing in the production of the food in the back-room, the service in the front-room was defined and oriented to the customer. It was the McDonald's operations system of both production and service that made the difference. McDonald's also pioneered the idea of franchising this operation system to rapidly spread the business around the country and later the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=McDonald's: Behind the Arches|last=Love, John F.|first=|publisher=Bantam|year=1986|isbn=0-553-34759-4|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[FedEx]] in 1971 provided the first overnight delivery of packages in the U.S.  This was based on the innovative idea of flying all packages into the single airport in Memphis Tenn by midnight each day, resorting the packages for delivery to destinations and then flying them back out the next morning for delivery to numerous locations.  This concept of a fast package delivery system created a whole new industry, and eventually allowed fast delivery of online orders by Amazon and other retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=FedEx Delivers|last=Birla, Madan|first=|publisher=Wiley|year=2007|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walmart]] provided the first example of very low cost retailing through design of their stores and efficient management of their entire supply chain. Starting with a single store in Roger's Arkansas in 1962, Walmart has now become the world's largest company. This was accomplished by adhering to their system of delivering the goods and the service to the customers at the lowest possible cost.  The operations system included careful selection of merchandise, low cost sourcing, ownership of transportation, cross-docking, efficient location of stores and friendly home-town service to the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wal-Mar Effect|last=Fishman, Charles|first=|publisher=Penquin Books|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), recognizing the growing importance of quality, issued the [[ISO 9000]], a family of standards related to quality management systems. There standards apply to both manufacturing and service organizations. There has been some controversy regarding the proper procedures to follow and the amount of paperwork involved, but much of that has improved in current ISO 9000 revisions.

With the coming of the Internet, in 1994 [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] devised a service system of on-line retailing and distribution.  With this innovative system customers were able to search for products they might like to buy, enter the order for the product, pay online, and track delivery of the product to their location, all in two days.  This required not only very large computer operations, but dispersed warehouses, and an efficient transportation system.  Service to customers including a high merchandise assortment, return services of purchases, and fast delivery is at the forefront of this business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-jeff-bezos-facts-story-history-2014-5|title=14 Quirky Things You Didn't Know About Amazon|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the customer being in the system during the production and delivery of the service that distinguishes all services from manufacturing.

Recent trends in the field revolve around concepts such as:

* [[Business Process Re-engineering]] (launched by [[Michael Martin Hammer|Michael Hammer]] in 1993&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Martin Hammer|M.Hammer]], [[James A. Champy|J.Champy]], Reengineering the Corporation: A Manifesto for Business Revolution, Harper Business 1993&lt;/ref&gt;): a business management strategy focusing on the analysis and design of workflows and business processes within an organization. BPR seeks to help companies radically restructure their organizations by focusing on the ground-up design of their business processes.
* Lean systems is a systemic method for the elimination of waste ("[[Muda (Japanese term)|Muda]]") within a manufacturing or service process.  Lean also takes into account waste created through overburden ("[[Muri (Japanese term)|Muri]]") and waste created through unevenness in work loads ("[[Mura (Japanese term)|Mura]]"). The term lean manufacturing was coined in the book [[The Machine That Changed the World (book)|The Machine that Changed the World]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James P. Womack|Womack]], Jones, Roos, The Machine that Changed the World, Free Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, [[lean services]] has been widely applied.
* [[Six Sigma]] (an approach to quality developed at [[Motorola]] between 1985-1987): Six Sigma refers to control limits placed at six (6) [[standard deviations]] from the mean of a [[normal distribution]], this became very famous after [[Jack Welch]] of [[General Electric]] launched a company-wide initiative in 1995 to adopt this set of methods to all manufacturing, service and administrative processes. More recently, Six Sigma has included [[DMAIC]] (for improving processes) and [[DFSS]] (for designing new products and new processes)
* [[Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems]]: a production system designed at the outset for rapid change in its structure, as well as its hardware and software components, in order to quickly adjust its production capacity and functionality within a part family in response to sudden market changes or intrinsic system change.
* [[Project Production Management]]: the application of the analytical tools and techniques developed for operations management, as described in [[Factory Physics]] to the activities within major capital projects such as encountered in oil &amp; gas and civil infrastructure delivery.

===Production systems===
[[File:Job Shop Ordonnancement.JPEG|thumb|right|300px|In a job shop machines are grouped by technological similarities regarding transformation processes, therefore a single shop can work very different products (in this picture four colors). Also notice that in this drawing each shop contains a single machine.]]
[[File:FlexiblesFertigungssystem.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Flexible Manufacturing System: in the middle there are two rails for the shuttle to move [[pallets]] between machining centers (there are also FMS which use [[Automated guided vehicle|AGV]]s), in front of each machining center there is a buffer and in left we have a shelf for storing pallets. Usually in the back there is a similar system for managing the set of [[tools]] required for different [[machining]] operations.]]

A production system comprises both the technological elements (machines and tools) and organizational behavior (division of labor and information flow). An individual production system is usually analyzed in the literature referring to a single business, therefore it's usually improper to include in a given production system the operations necessary to process goods that are obtained by [[purchasing]] or the operations carried by the [[customer]] on the sold products, the reason being simply that since businesses need to design their own production systems this then becomes the focus of analysis, modeling and decision making (also called "configuring" a production system).

A first possible distinction in production systems (technological classification) is between continuous process production and discrete part production ([[manufacturing]]). 
*Process production means that the product undergoes physical-chemical transformations and lacks assembly operations, therefore the original raw materials can't easily be obtained from the final product, examples include: [[paper]], [[cement]], [[nylon]] and [[petroleum products]]. 
*Part production (ex:cars and ovens) comprises both [[Manufacturing|fabrication]] systems and [[assembly line|assembly]] systems. In the first category we find [[job shops]], [[manufacturing cells]], [[flexible manufacturing systems]] and [[transfer lines]], in the assembly category we have [[fixed position]] systems, [[assembly lines]] and [[assembly shops]] (both manual and/or automated operations).&lt;ref name="PortPozz"&gt;A. Portioli, A.Pozzetti, Progettazione dei sistemi produttivi, Hoepli 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Note: this classification is very old but it has been subject to update as production systems have evolved over the 20th century, for a complete picture consult recent texts''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Class wort.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Delivery lead time is the blue bar, manufacturing time is the whole bar, the green bar is the difference between the two.]]

Another possible classification&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Wortmann|J.C. Wortmann]], Chapter: "A classification scheme for master production schedule", in Efficiency of Manufacturing Systems, C. Berg, D. French and B. Wilson (eds) New York, Plenum Press 1983&lt;/ref&gt; is one based on [[Lead Time]] (manufacturing lead time vs delivery lead time): [[engineer to order]] (ETO), [[purchase to order]] (PTO), [[make to order]] (MTO), [[assemble to order]] (ATO) and [[make to stock]] (MTS). According to this classification different kinds of systems will have different customer order decoupling points (CODP), meaning that [[work in progress]] (WIP) cycle stock levels are practically nonexistent regarding operations located after the CODP (except for [[Work in process|WIP]] due to queues). (See [[Order fulfillment#Options|Order fulfillment]])

The concept of production systems can be expanded to the [[service sector]] world keeping in mind that services have some fundamental differences in respect to material goods: intangibility, client always present during transformation processes, no stocks for "finished goods". Services can be classified according to a service process matrix:&lt;ref&gt;Roger W. Schmenner, How Can Service Businesses Survive and Prosper?, Sloan Management Review, vol. 27, no. 3, Spring 1986 http://umairbali.ekalaam.com/Business%20Process%20Workflow%20Analysis/Week6/SMR-ServiceBusiness.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; degree of labor intensity (volume) vs degree of customization (variety). With a high degree of labor intensity there are Mass Services (e.g., [[commercial banking]] bill payments and [[state schools]]) and Professional Services (e.g., personal [[physicians]] and [[lawyers]]), while with a low degree of labor intensity there are Service Factories (e.g., [[airlines]] and [[hotels]]) and Service Shops (e.g., [[hospitals]] and [[auto mechanics]]).

The systems described above are [[ideal types]]: real systems may present themselves as hybrids of those categories. Consider, for example, that the production of [[jeans]] involves initially [[carding]], [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]], [[dyeing]] and [[weaving]], then cutting the fabric in different shapes and assembling the parts in pants or jackets by combining the fabric with thread, zippers and buttons, finally [[Finishing (textiles)|finishing]] and [[distressing]] the pants/jackets before being shipped to stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-1/Blue-Jeans.html|title=How blue jeans is made - material, manufacture, making, history, used, procedure, steps, product, machine|work=madehow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning can be seen as process production, the middle as part production and the end again as process production: it's unlikely that a single company will keep all the stages of production under a single roof, therefore the problem of [[vertical integration]] and [[outsourcing]] arises. Most products require, ''from a [[supply chain]] perspective'', both process production and part production.

===Metrics: efficiency and effectiveness===

Operations strategy concerns policies and plans of use of the firm productive resources with the aim of supporting long term competitive strategy. Metrics in operations management can be broadly classified into [[efficiency]] metrics and [[effectiveness]] metrics. Effectiveness metrics involve: 
# [[Price]] (actually fixed by marketing, but lower bounded by production cost): purchase price, use costs, maintenance costs, upgrade costs, disposal costs
# [[Quality (business)|Quality]]: specification and compliance
# [[Time]]: productive [[lead time]], information lead time, [[punctuality]]
# [[Flexibility (engineering)|Flexibility]]: mix, volume, gamma
# Stock [[availability]]
# Ecological Soundness: biological and [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental impacts]] of the system under study.

A more recent approach, introduced by Terry Hill,&lt;ref&gt;T. Hill, ''Manufacturing Strategy-Text and Cases'', 3rd ed. Mc-Graw Hill 2000&lt;/ref&gt; involves distinguishing competitive variables in order winner and order qualifiers when defining operations strategy. Order winners are variables which permit differentiating the company from competitors, while order qualifiers  are prerequisites for engaging in a transaction. This view can be seen as a unifying approach between operations management and [[marketing]] (see [[Market segment|segmentation]] and [[positioning (marketing)|positioning]]).

[[Productivity]] is a standard efficiency metric for evaluation of production systems, broadly speaking a ratio between outputs and inputs, and can assume many specific forms,&lt;ref&gt;Grando A., Organizzazione e Gestione della Produzione Industriale, Egea 1993&lt;/ref&gt; for example: machine productivity, workforce productivity, raw material productivity, warehouse productivity (=[[inventory turnover]]). It is also useful to break up productivity in use U (productive percentage of total time) and yield η (ratio between produced volume and productive time) to better evaluate production systems performances. Cycle times can be modeled through [[manufacturing]] engineering if the individual operations are heavily automated, if the manual component is the prevalent one, methods used include: [[time and motion study]], [[predetermined motion time systems]] and [[work sampling]].

[[Image:ABC class.jpg|thumb|right|400px|An ABC cumulated curve. Typically one curve is constructed for revenue (consumption) and another for inventory (stock).]]

[[ABC analysis]] is a method for analyzing inventory based on [[Pareto distribution]], it posits that since revenue from items on inventory will be [[power law]] distributed then it makes sense to manage items differently based on their position on a revenue-inventory level matrix, 3 classes are constructed (A, B and C) from cumulative item revenues, so in a matrix each item will have a letter (A, B or C) assigned for revenue and inventory. This method posits that items away from the diagonal should be managed differently: items in the upper part are subject to risk of obsolescence, items in the lower part are subject to risk of [[stockout]].

[[Throughput (business)|Throughput]] is a variable which quantifies the number of parts produced in the unit of time. Although estimating throughput for a single process maybe fairly simple, doing so for an entire production system involves an additional difficulty due to the presence of queues which can come from: machine [[breakdown (vehicle)|breakdown]]s, processing time variability, scraps, setups, [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] time, lack of orders, lack of materials, [[strike action|strikes]], bad coordination between resources, mix variability, plus all these inefficiencies tend to compound depending on the nature of the production system. One important example of how system throughput is tied to system design are [[Bottleneck (production)|bottlenecks]]: in job shops bottlenecks are typically dynamic and dependent on scheduling while on transfer lines it makes sense to speak of "the bottleneck" since it can be univocally associated with a specific station on the line. This leads to the problem of how to define [[Productive capacity|capacity]] measures, that is an estimation of the maximum output of a given production system, and [[Capacity utilization#Engineering and economic measures|capacity utilization]].

[[Overall equipment effectiveness]] (OEE) is defined as the product between system availability, cycle time efficiency and quality rate. OEE is typically used as key performance indicator (KPI) in conjunction with the lean manufacturing approach.

===Configuration and management===

Designing the ''configuration of production systems'' involves both [[technological]] and [[organizational]] variables. Choices in production technology involve: dimensioning [[Productive capacity|capacity]], fractioning capacity, capacity location, [[outsourcing]] processes, process technology, [[automation]] of operations, trade-off between volume and variety (see [[Hayes-Wheelwright matrix]]). Choices in the organizational area involve: defining worker [[skills]] and [[Accountability|responsibilities]], team coordination, worker incentives and information flow.

Regarding ''[[production planning]]'', there is a basic distinction between the [[Push-pull strategy|push]] approach and the [[Push–pull strategy|pull]] approach, with the later including the singular approach of [[Just in time (business)|just in time]]. Pull means that the production system authorizes production based on inventory level; push means that production occurs based on demand (forecasted or present, that is [[purchase orders]]). An individual production system can be both push and pull; for example activities before the CODP may work under a pull system, while activities after the CODP may work under a push system.

[[File:Eoq inventory 0001.png|thumb|right|320px|Classic EOQ model: trade-off between ordering cost (blue) and [[holding cost]] (red). Total cost (green) admits a [[global optimum]].]]

Regarding the traditional pull approach to [[inventory control]], a number of techniques have been developed based on the work of Ford W. Harris&lt;ref name="jstor170962" /&gt; (1913), which came to be known as the [[economic order quantity]] (EOQ) model. This model marks the beginning of [[inventory theory]], which includes the [[Dynamic lot-size model|Wagner-Within procedure]], the [[newsvendor model]], [[base stock model]] and the [[Fixed Time Period]] model. These models usually involve the calculation of [[cycle stocks]] and [[buffer stocks]], the latter usually modeled as a function of demand variability. The economic production quantity&lt;ref&gt;Taft, E. W. "The most economical production lot." Iron Age 101.18 (1918): 1410-1412.&lt;/ref&gt; (EPQ) differs from the EOQ model only in that it assumes a constant fill rate for the part being produced, instead of the instantaneous refilling of the EOQ model.

[[File:MRP2.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II)|A typical MRPII construct: general planning (top) concerned with forecasts, capacity planning and inventory levels, programming (middle) concerned with calculation of [[workloads]], rough-cut capacity planning, MPS, [[Capacity planning|capacity requirements planning]], traditional MRP planning, control (bottom) concerned with [[Scheduling (production processes)|scheduling]].]]

[[Joseph Orlickly]] and others at IBM developed a [[Push-pull strategy|push]] approach to inventory control and production planning, now known as [[material requirements planning]] (MRP), which takes as input both the [[master production schedule]] (MPS) and the [[bill of materials]] (BOM) and gives as output a schedule for the materials (components) needed in the production process. MRP therefore is a planning tool to manage [[purchase orders]] and production orders (also called jobs).

The MPS can be seen as a kind of aggregate planning for production coming in two fundamentally opposing varieties: plans which try to [[Aggregate planning#Chase plans|chase]] demand and [[Aggregate planning#Level plans|level]] plans which try to keep uniform capacity utilization. Many models have been proposed to solve MPS problems:
* Analytical models (e.g. Magee Boodman model)
* Exact optimization algorithmic models (e.g. [[Linear programming|LP]] and [[Integer programming#Canonical and standard form for ILPs|ILP]])
* [[Heuristic]] models (e.g. Aucamp model).

MRP can be briefly described as a 3s procedure: sum (different orders), split (in lots), shift (in time according to item lead time). To avoid an "explosion" of data processing in MRP (number of BOMs required in input) [[planning bills]] (such as family bills or super bills) can be useful since they allow a rationalization of input data into common codes.
MRP had some notorious problems such as infinite [[capacity utilization|capacity]] and fixed [[lead times]], which influenced successive modifications of the original software architecture in the form of [[MRP II]], [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) and [[advanced planning and scheduling]] (APS).

In this context problems of [[scheduling (production processes)|scheduling (sequencing of production)]], loading (tools to use), part type selection (parts to work on) and applications of [[operations research]] have a significant role to play.

[[Lean manufacturing]] is an approach to production which arose in [[Toyota]] between the end of World War II and the seventies. It comes mainly from the ideas of [[Taiichi Ohno]] and [[Toyoda Sakichi]] which are centered on the complementary notions of [[Just in time (business)|just in time]] and [[autonomation]] (jidoka), all aimed at reducing waste (usually applied in [[PDCA]] style). Some additional elements are also fundamental:&lt;ref&gt;W. Hopp, M. Spearman, ''Factory Physics'', 3rd ed. Waveland Press, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; production smoothing (Heijunka), capacity buffers, setup reduction, cross-training and plant layout.
* [[Heijunka]]: production smoothing presupposes a level strategy for the [[Master Production Schedule|MPS]] and a [[final assembly schedule]] developed from the MPS by smoothing aggregate production requirements in smaller time buckets and sequencing final assembly to achieve repetitive manufacturing. ''If these conditions are met'', [[Expected value|expected]] [[throughput (business)|throughput]] can be equaled to the inverse of [[takt time]]. Besides volume, heijunka also means attaining [[mixed model production]], which however may only be feasible through set-up reduction. A standard tool for achieving this is the [[Heijunka box]].
* Capacity buffers: ideally a JIT system would work with zero breakdowns, this however is very hard to achieve in practice, nonetheless Toyota favors acquiring extra capacity over extra WIP to deal with starvation.
* [[Setup cost|Set-up]] reduction: typically necessary to achieve mixed model production, a key distinction can be made between internal and external setup. Internal setups (e.g. removing a die) refers to tasks when the machine is not working, while external setups can be completed while the machine is running (ex:transporting dies).
* [[Cross-training (business)|Cross training]]: important as an element of Autonomation, Toyota cross trained their employees through rotation, this served as an element of production flexibility, holistic thinking and reducing boredom.
* [[Process layout|Layout]]: U-shaped lines or cells are common in the lean approach since they allow for minimum walking, greater worker efficiency and flexible capacity.

[[File:Kanban esp.png|thumb|320px|right|When introducing kanbans in real production systems, attaining unitary lot from the start maybe unfeasible, therefore the kanban will represent a given lot size defined by management.]]

A series of tools have been developed mainly with the objective of replicating Toyota success: a very common implementation involves small cards known as [[kanbans]]; these also come in some varieties: reorder kanbans, alarm kanbans, triangular kanbans, etc. In the classic kanban procedure with one card:
* Parts are kept in containers with their respective kanbans
* The downstream station moves the kanban to the upstream station and starts producing the part at the downstream station
* The upstream operator takes the most urgent kanban from his list (compare to [[Kendall's notation#D: The queue's discipline|queue discipline]] from queue theory) and produces it and attach its respective kanban

The two-card kanban procedure differs a bit:
* The downstream operator takes the production kanban from his list
* If required parts are available he removes the move kanban and places them in another box, otherwise he chooses another production card
* He produces the part and attach its respective production kanban
* Periodically a mover picks up the move kanbans in upstream stations and search for the respective parts, when found he exchanges production kanbans for move kanbans and move the parts to downstream stations

Since the number of kanbans in the production system is set by managers as a constant number, the kanban procedure works as [[Work in process|WIP]] controlling device, which for a given arrival rate, per [[Little's law]], works as a lead time controlling device.

[[File:Vsm-epa.gif|thumb|right|320px|[[Value stream mapping]], a representation of materials and information flows inside a company, mainly used in the lean manufacturing approach. The calculation of the time-line (bottom) usually involves using [[Little's law]] to derive lead time from stock levels and [[takt time]].]]

In Toyota the TPS represented more of a philosophy of production than a set of specific lean tools, the latter would include: 
*[[Single-Minute Exchange of Die|SMED]]: a method for reducing changeover times
*[[Value stream mapping]]: a graphical method for analyzing the current state and designing a future state
*lot-size reduction
*elimination of time batching
*[[Production flow analysis#Rank Order Clustering|Rank Order Clustering]]: an algorithm which groups machines and product families together, used for designing [[manufacturing cells]]
*single-point [[scheduling (production processes)|scheduling]], the opposite of the traditional push approach
*[[multi-process handling]]: when one operator is responsible for operating several machines or processes
*[[poka-yoke]]: any mechanism in lean manufacturing that helps an equipment operator avoid (''yokeru'') mistakes (''poka'')
*[[5S (methodology)|5S]]: describes how to organize a work space for efficiency and effectiveness by identifying and storing the items used, maintaining the area and items, and sustaining the new order
*[[backflush accounting]]: a product costing approach in which costing is delayed until goods are finished

Seen more broadly, JIT can include methods such as: product standardization and [[Modularity#Modularity in technology and management|modularity]], [[group technology]], [[total productive maintenance]], [[job enlargement]], [[job enrichment]], [[flat organization]] and [[vendor rating]] (JIT production is very sensitive to replenishment conditions).

In heavily [[automated]] production systems production planning and information gathering may be executed via the [[control system]], attention should be paid however to avoid problems such as [[deadlocks]], as these can lead to productivity losses.

[[Project Production Management (PPM)]] applies the concepts of operations management to the execution of delivery of capital projects by viewing the sequence of activities in a project as a production system.&lt;ref&gt;"Factory Physics for Managers", E. S. Pound, J. H. Bell, and M. L. Spearman, McGraw-Hill, 2014, p 47&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"New Era of Project Delivery – Project as Production System", R. G. Shenoy and T. R. Zabelle, Journal of Project Production Management, Vol 1,&amp;nbsp; pp Nov 2016, pp 13-24 &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312602707_New_Era_of_Project_Delivery_-_Project_as_Production_System&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Operations managements principles of variability reduction and management are applied by buffering through a combination of capacity, time and inventory.

===Service operations===
{{main|Operations management for services}}
[[Service industries]] are a major part of economic activity and employment in all industrialized countries comprising 80 percent of employment and GDP in the U.S.  Operations management of these services, as distinct from manufacturing, has been developing since the 1970s through publication of unique practices and academic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trade.gov/publications/ita-newsletter/1010/services-sector-how-best-to-measure-it.asp|title=The Services Sector: How Best to Measure it?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203022303/http://trade.gov/publications/ita-newsletter/1010/services-sector-how-best-to-measure-it.asp|archive-date=2010-12-03|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Please note that this section does not particularly include "Professional Services Firms" and the professional services practiced from this expertise (specialized training and education within).

According to Fitzsimmons, Fitzsimmons and Bordoloi (2014) differences between manufactured goods and services are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Service Management: Operations, Strategy and Technology|last=Fitzsimmons, J, Fitzsimmons, M. and Bordoloi, S.|first=|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2014|isbn=978-0-07-802407-8|location=8th, New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Simultaneous production and consumption.'' High contact services (e.g. health care) must be produced in the presence of the customer, since they are consumed as produced. As a result, services cannot be produced in one location and transported to another, like goods. Service operations are therefore highly dispersed geographically close to the customers. Furthermore, simultaneous production and consumption allows the possibility of self-service involving the customer at the point of consumption (e.g. gas stations). Only low-contact services produced in the "backroom" (e.g., check clearing) can be provided away from the customer.
* ''Perishable.'' Since services are perishable, they cannot be stored for later use. In manufacturing companies, inventory can be used to buffer supply and demand. Since buffering is not possible in services, highly variable demand must be met by operations or demand modified to meet supply.
* ''Ownership.'' In manufacturing, ownership is transferred to the customer. Ownership is not transferred for service. As a result, services cannot be owned or resold.
* ''Tangibility.'' A service is intangible making it difficult for a customer to evaluate the service in advance. In the case of a manufactured good, customers can see it and evaluate it. Assurance of quality service is often done by licensing, government regulation, and branding to assure customers they will receive a quality service.
These four comparisons indicate how management of service operations are quite different from manufacturing regarding such issues as capacity requirements (highly variable), quality assurance (hard to quantify), location of facilities (dispersed), and interaction with the customer during delivery of the service (product and process design).

While there are differences there are also many similarities.  For example, quality management approaches used in manufacturing such as the Baldrige Award, and Six Sigma have been widely applied to services.  Likewise, [[Lean services|lean service]] principles and practices have also been applied in service operations. The important difference being the customer is in the system while the service is being provided and needs to be considered when applying these practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Operations Management|last=Heizer, Jay; Render, Barry|first=|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=2011|isbn=978-0-13-611941-8|location=10th ed. Upper Saddle River, N.J.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One important difference is service recovery.  When an error occurs in service delivery, the recovery must be delivered on the spot by the service provider.  If a waiter in a restaurant spills soup on the customer's lap, then the recovery could include a free meal and a promise of free dry cleaning.  Another difference is in planning capacity.  Since the product cannot be stored, the service facility must be managed to peak demand which requires more flexibility than manufacturing. Location of facilities must be near the customers and scale economics can be lacking. Scheduling must consider the customer can be waiting in line.   Queuing theory has been devised to assist in design of service facilities waiting lines.  Revenue management is important for service operations, since empty seats on an airplane are lost revenue when the plane departs and cannot be stored for future use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Service Operations:Management: Improving Service Service Delivery (Fourth edition)|last=Johnston, Robert; Clark, Graham; Shulver, Michael|first=|publisher=Pearson|year=2012|isbn=978-0-273-74048-3|location=London, England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematical modeling===

[[File:ServidorParalelo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Queueing network#Queueing networks|Queue networks]] are systems in which single queues are connected by a routing network. In this image servers are represented by circles, queues by a series of retangles and the routing network by arrows. In the study of queue networks one typically tries to obtain the [[equilibrium distribution]] of the network.]]
[[File:Simplex-method-3-dimensions.png|thumb|right|Illustration of the [[Simplex method]], a classical approach to solving [[Linear programming|LP]] optimization problems and also [[integer programming]] (ex:[[branch and cut]]). Mainly used in push approach&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[R. B. Chase]], F.R. Jacobs, N. Aquilano, Operations Management: For Competitive Advantage, McGraw-Hill 2007&lt;/ref&gt; but also in production system configuration.&lt;ref name="PortPozz"/&gt; The interior of the green [[polytope]] geometrically represents the [[feasible region]], while the red line indicates the sequence of [[pivot operations]] required to reach the [[optimal solution]].]]

There are also fields of mathematical theory which have found applications in the field of operations management such as [[operations research]]: mainly [[mathematical optimization]] problems and [[queue theory]]. Queue theory is employed in modelling queue and processing times in production systems while mathematical optimization draws heavily from [[multivariate calculus]] and [[linear algebra]].  Queue theory is based on [[Markov chain]]s and [[stochastic process]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Burnetas A.N. and M. N.Katehakis (1993).. "On Sequencing Two Types of Tasks on a Single Processor under Incomplete Information", Probability in the Engineering and Informational Sciences,  7 (1), 85-0119.&lt;/ref&gt; It also worth noticing that computations of [[safety stock]]s are usually based on modeling demand as a [[normal distribution]] and MRP and some inventory problems can be formulated using [[optimal control]].&lt;ref&gt;Zipkin Paul H., Foundations of Inventory Management, Boston: McGraw Hill, 2000, {{ISBN|0-256-11379-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When analytical models are not enough, managers may resort to using [[Simulation#Production|simulation]]. Simulation has been traditionally done thought the [[Discrete event simulation]] paradigm, where the simulation model possesses a state which can only change when a discrete event happens, which consists of a clock and list of events. The more recent [[Transaction-level modeling]] paradigm consists of a set of resources and a set of transactions: transactions move through a network of resources (nodes) according to a code, called process.

[[File:Xbar chart for a paired xbar and R chart.svg|thumb|left|300px|A control chart: [[Business process|process]] output variable is modeled by a [[probability density function]] and for each [[statistic]] of the [[sample (statistics)|sample]] an upper control line and lower control line are fixed, when the statistic moves out of bounds, an alarm is given and possible causes are investigated. In this drawing the statistic of choice is the [[mean]] and red points represent alarm points.]]

Since real production processes are always affected by disturbances in both inputs and outputs, many companies implement some form of [[Quality management]] or [[quality control]]. The [[Seven Basic Tools of Quality]] designation provides a summary of commonly used tools:

*[[check sheet]]s
*[[Pareto chart]]s
*[[Ishikawa diagrams]] (Cause-and-effect diagram)
*[[control charts]]
*[[histogram]]
*[[scatter diagram]]
*[[stratified sampling|stratification]]

These are used in approaches like [[Total quality management]] and [[Six Sigma]]. Keeping quality under control is relevant to both increasing customer satisfaction and reducing processing waste.

Operations management [[textbooks]] usually cover [[demand forecasting]], even though it is not strictly speaking an operations problem, because demand is related to some production systems variables.  For example, a classic approach in dimensioning [[safety stocks]] requires calculating [[standard deviation]] of [[forecast errors]]. Demand forecasting is also a critical part of push systems, since order releases have to be planned ahead of actual clients orders. Also any serious discussion of [[capacity planning]] involves adjusting company outputs with market demands.

===Safety, Risk and Maintenance===

Other important [[management]] problems involve [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] policies &lt;ref&gt;Katehakis M.N. and C. Derman (1989). "On the maintenance of systems composed of highly reliable components", Management Science, 6 (5): 16-28.&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[reliability engineering]] and [[maintenance philosophy]]), [[safety management systems]] (see also [[safety engineering]] and [[Risk management]]), [[facility management]] and supply chain integration.

In 2013, Mycoskie was named [[GQ|GQ’s Menswear Designer of the Year]] &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/announcing-the-2013-gq-best-new-menswear-designers-in-america|title=Announcing the 2013 GQ Best New Menswear Designers in America|last=Sebra|first=Matt|date=2013-03-14|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007 was named one of [[Los Angeles Business Journal|LA Business Journal’s “Top Bosses Under 30”.]]

==Early life and education==
Mycoskie was born in [[Arlington, Texas]] to Pam Mycoskie, an author and Mike Mycoskie, an orthopedic surgeon. She has two siblings: younger brother Tyler Mycoskie and older brother [[Blake Mycoskie]], founder and Chief Shoe Giver of [[Toms Shoes]]. She attended Arlington Martin High School where she was recognized as a state Volleyball champion. Excelling in sports, she was also on the Arizona State University Water Ski Team while attending ASU’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism. An avid athlete, she still enjoys surfing; scuba diving; water skiing; and snowboarding.

Complimenting her lifelong love of athletics is her infinite passion for music, fashion, and art, most notably the sounds and casual wear made popular through the 60s and 70s [[counterculture]] era. Her paternal grandmother Hazel Mycoskie was a master seamstress and owned her own retail store specializing in denim fashions in the 70s, and would inspire Mycoskie to design, sketch, and produce garments from scratch.

Mycoskie spent her teenage years in Arlington on the hunt for 70s&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hoodline.com/2016/01/with-clothes-concerts-aviator-nation-makes-a-home-in-the-haight|title=With Clothes &amp; Concerts, Aviator Nation Makes A Home In The Haight {{!}} Hoodline|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; vintage tees and hoodies and attending concerts at Starplex, the nearby amphitheatre. She particularly is inspired by the history and the phenomena created by music and art festivals. Mycoskie cites [[Woodstock]] as a major influence in both her work and her personal life as the festival best encapsulates music’s power of connectivity, its ability to reveal our humanity, creativity, and personal expression.

== Amazing Race ==
Mycoskie and her brother Blake auditioned for CBS’ [[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]] in 2001, independently sending in their applications. They both made it to final interviews. Realizing they were siblings, executives at CBS offered to cast both of them for season two of [[The Amazing Race]]. They agreed to that opportunity preferring to compete as a team. They finished in third place, missing the million dollar prize by four minutes.

== Career ==
In 2001 Mycoskie moved to [[Southern California]]&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; for her first internship at Shape Magazine. She soon shifted focus to freelance photography, video, graphic design, and branding. Opportunities for work in these fields were ideal for her adventurous and active lifestyle. She steadily developed successful campaigns in branding and commercials, and created the TOMS iconic logo for her brother’s company [[Toms Shoes|TOMS Shoes]]. She became a buyer’s assistant at ZJ Boarding House in Venice, CA where her love for clothing was reignited, dedicated to honoring the 70s casual wear style, look, and feel. She realized that the laid-back lifestyle of beach, surf, and sand provided the pivotal outlet for her to channel her life passions collectively. She wanted to create a brand that fostered athletics, adventure, creativity, music, and clothing all in one.

Discovering that vintage clothing was harder to find, Mycoskie decided to create her own clothes, sewing, dying, and designing herself. Debuting with a white hoodie with rainbow stripes in the hood, known as the brand’s “Signature Hoodie”, [[Aviator Nation]] was in business. The California [[surf culture]] is evident in all her pieces designing clothing, accessories, and surfboards.

== Aviator Nation ==
Mycoskie established Aviator Nation in Venice, CA in 2006. Gravitating towards clothing that suit her active lifestyle, Aviator Nation is a complete contemporary casual wear lifestyle brand, selling T-shirts, hoodies, sweatpants, tanks, outerwear, and hats to name a few. Mycoskie remains true to her inspired era, studying vintage fabrics, the process of fiber weaving, inks, and dye treatments popular in the 70s. Production of garments employ hand stitching and hand drawn graphics, ensuring originality, a vintage essence, and a worn-in feel.

Aviator Nation has a main focus in connecting fashion with music festivals, raising funds for philanthropies, and generating a greater awareness of our collective consciousness. The brand works with [[Global Citizen Festival]] by creating festival merchandise with proceeds aiding in the festival’s ongoing campaign to end poverty. The brand also has partnerships with [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aviatornation.com/blogs/news/114285127-behind-the-scenes-with-aviator-nation-at-austin-city-limits-2014|title=BEHIND THE SCENES with Aviator Nation at Austin City Limits 2014|last=Nation|first=Aviator|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://store.aclfestival.com/collections/aviator-nation-for-acl-festival|title=Aviator Nation for ACL Festival - ACL Music Festival|website=store.aclfestival.com|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/19/image/la-ig-paige-mycoskie-20130519|title=Aviator Nation's founder always looks on the bright side|last=Moore|first=Booth|date=2013-05-19|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Music festival|Lollapalooza Music Festival]]; and with [[John Mayer]]’s&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://johnmayer.shop.musictoday.com/product/JMCT345/jm-x-aviator-nation-rugby-t-shirt|title=JM x Aviator Nation Rugby T-shirt|website=johnmayer.shop.musictoday.com|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefashionisto.com/gap-x-gq-2013-best-new-designers-collection-highlights/|title=Gap x GQ 2013 Best New Designers Collection Highlights|date=2013-09-24|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/sep/23/news/la-ar-gap-x-gq-best-new-menswear-designers-collection-20130923|title=Gap x GQ Best New Menswear Designers collection drops Tuesday|last=Tschorn|first=Adam|date=2013-09-23|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; previous concert tours.

== Career Highlights ==
In 2013, Mycoskie was named GQ’s Menswear Designer of the Year and in 2008 was named one of [[Los Angeles Business Journal|LA Business Journal’s]] “Top Bosses Under 30”.

Mycoskie and Aviator Nation have been featured in: LA Times, NY Times, GQ, Vogue, Elle, Harpers Bazaar, Nylon, Self, Fitness, Shape, Travel and Leisure, Malibu Magazine, LA Business journal, WWD, California Apparel News, People, Time, Details, Rolling Stone, Glamour, Foam, Entertainment Weekly, Juxtapoz, Cosmo, Seventeen, Us Weekly, Bloomberg Report, Antenna, Life &amp;amp;amp; Style, Safari

== Personal life ==
Mycoskie is an avid surfer/musician and loves the [[Hawaiian Islands]].  Passions for surfing, music, and her Southern California lifestyle are all very present in her signature designs. Music fuels much of her artistry, noting [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[The Beach Boys]], and [[Eagles (band)|The Eagles]] as sound favorites. Aviator Nation’s prints include drawings from Mycoskie’s earliest sketches, and she still hand draws some of the icons found on her clothing from the signature lightning bolts to psychedelic maidens. The use of rainbows and bright colors found in Aviator Nation clothing that has now become the brand’s niche, comes from her mother Pam’s preference of decorating and dressing Mycoskie in bold colors and rainbows prints.

Mycoskie is extremely hands-on with every aspect of her brand.  Whether it be painting the inside of one of her flagship stores, drawing each graphic by hand, or communicating face to face with her customers, she is very much involved in each element of the company.  She has been referred to as “A Jill-of- all-trades” and described as having “a lively dream-catcher spirit”. Regular visits to the [[Los Angeles]]-based factory are part of her weekly routine. Her goal is to have wearers and supporters feel like rock stars when sporting her brand, a full reflection of her own lifestyle.

Mycoskie is a philanthropist and has done projects and events for a variety of non-profits including Charity Water; Surf Aid; Heal the Bay; Surfer’s Healing; and Global Citizen.

She resides in [[Malibu, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/malibu-california-beach-getaway|title=Malibu: California Beach Getaway|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PerForm''' and '''PerForm PRO''' were electronic form programs, initially designed to work under [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]] in [[DOS]]. Later versions were designed to work in [[Windows 3.1]], at which point it was succeeded by [[FormFlow]]. 

The initial version of PerForm was created in 1988 and was the first product released by [[Canada|Canadian]] software firm [[Delrina]], which became best known for its later fax software program, [[WinFax]]. Chief Technical Officer [[Bert Amato]] and President of the company [[Mark Skapinker]] came up with the idea for the product while working as consultants that what their clients wanted was a way to fill in forms electronically, rather than an easier way to create paper-based forms from a computer.&lt;ref name="Softwarriors p34"&gt;{{Cite journal

  | date = March 1994
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program consisted of two parts: a form design module which gave users a graphical user interface for creating and arranging form elements, using tools largely familiar to those using desktop publishing or paint programs of the era, and a separate form filling program which would display the resulting form that the user could then fill in&lt;ref name="Zisman"&gt;{{cite web

 |access-date= November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Those entering information into the forms could not change or alter the forms; they were limited to adding information in the various form fields on screen. Some of the potential uses of the program included being able to create invoices, payment records, personnel and payroll forms, and just about any other standardized  form that may have been required.&lt;ref name="Zisman"&gt;{{cite web

There was significant and long-term uptake of electronic forms products within governmental agencies both in Canada&lt;ref name="TransportCanada"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/gol/environment.htm |title="TRANSPORT CANADA'S IM/IT ENVIRONMENT 2006/2007", with a contemporary reference to the use of Delrina FormFlow |accessdate=2007-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902012852/http://www.tc.gc.ca/gol/environment.htm |archivedate=2007-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States,&lt;ref name="USOffice"&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the firm's early major software deals included a multi-year agreement to sell PerForm to the U.S. Navy in 1990.&lt;ref name="Softwarriors p34"/&gt; Soon after the software was installed on [[Compaq]] [[laptops]] that accompanied U.S. troops during the [[First Gulf War]], where it was used to requisition "everything from [[Coca-Cola]] to [[Outhouse|privies]]".&lt;ref name="Softwarriors p34"/&gt; Other significant volume sales went to [[3M]] and [[Rockwell International]].&lt;ref name="Softwarriors p34"/&gt; What helped set apart Delrina's electronic forms from its competitors in product reviews included its easy-to-use interface, its extensive development tools, and its comparatively low price.&lt;ref name="FormTest"&gt;{{Cite journal
  | title = Putting electronic forms to the test
  | journal = InfoWorld

as its "Product of the Year" in the electronic forms
category, and [[PC World Magazine]] gave the product it's "Best Buy" designation.&lt;ref name="ProductOfTheYear1990"&gt;{{cite press release

The electronic forms division of Delrina was sold to [[JetForm]] in 1996. JetForm in turn was bought by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], and the electronic forms products were officially discontinued in 2004.

'''Roman Janoušek''' (born 3 July 1968) is an influential billionaire businessman and [[lobbyist]] from the [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17521319 | title=Fall of Czech lobbyist Janousek dubbed 'Voldemort' | publisher=BBC | accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014 he started serving a 4.5-year sentence he received for his hit-and-run automobile accident in March 2012.

==Business activities==
In June 1993 Janoušek co-founded Medea Real. He later made a lot of money in magazine publishing and real estate.

==Allegations of corruption==
Janoušek has been under investigation regarding allegations of tender-rigging and [[bribery]]. It is also alleged that his friendship with [[Pavel Bém]], mayor of [[Prague]] between 2002 and 2010, helped him in developing his business activities.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; He was one of the targets of the [[2013 Czech political corruption scandal]] which led to the downfall of [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]] [[Petr Nečas]] and his [[Petr Nečas's Cabinet|coalition government]].

==Hit-and-run==
On April 30, 2014, Janoušek was handed a 3-year prison sentence for a [[Hit and run (vehicular)|hit-and-run]] accident that took place in Prague in March 2012. It is claimed that he had been driving drunk when he collided with another car. He ran over the 51-year-old woman driver causing grievous bodily harm when she attempted to stop him from leaving the scene. Janoušek faced ten years in prison.&lt;ref name="Czech Radio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/prague-court-sentences-infamous-political-fixer-to-three-years-in-prison | title=Prague court sentences infamous political fixer to three years in prison | publisher=Radio Praha | accessdate=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the prosecution and Janoušek appealed the verdict.&lt;ref name="ihned140430"&gt;http://zpravy.ihned.cz/cesko/c1-62110180-janousek-je-vinen-rekl-soud-za-nehodu-ma-jit-na-tri-roky-za-mrize-a-pet-let-nesmi-ridit&lt;/ref&gt; The court eventually decided to increase Janoušek's prison sentence to 4.5 years and raised the term of his driving ban from 5 years to 7, stating that the injury sustained by the other driver was not the result of an accident but of a deliberate criminal act on the part of Janoušek.&lt;ref&gt;http://zpravy.idnes.cz/roman-janousek-u-vrchniho-soudu-dap-/krimi.aspx?c=A140915_152949_krimi_cen&lt;/ref&gt; On November 18, 2014, Janoušek began serving his sentence in the Brno city jail.&lt;ref&gt;http://zpravy.idnes.cz/janousek-musi-nastoupit-do-vezeni-d54-/krimi.aspx?c=A141118_101943_krimi_bse&lt;/ref&gt; Both the prosecution and Janoušek appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the Czech Republic]] but the verdict was upheld on July 28, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://zpravy.aktualne.cz/domaci/trest-pro-janouska-plati-nejvyssi-soud-dovolani-zamitl/r~c5c2ba30353411e593f4002590604f2e/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in Ireland, Vaughan's parents were Benjamin Vaughan and Ann Wolf; he was the youngest of a family of 12.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tclf.org/pioneer/samuel-vaughan/biography-samuel-vaughan Cultural Landscape Foundation, ''Biography of Samuel Vaughan''.]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a merchant and plantation owner, living largely in [[Jamaica]], from 1736 to 1752, when he set up business as a [[merchant bank]]er at Dunster's Court, [[Mincing Lane]], in the [[City of London]].&lt;ref name="Bos"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Boswell|title=The general correspondence of James Boswell, 1766–1769: 1768–1769.

==Political activist==
In politics Vaughan supported [[John Wilkes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter D. G. Thomas|title=John Wilkes: A Friend to Liberty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gU_43lc9JIUC&amp;pg=PA112|accessdate=17 May 2013|date=28 March 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-820544-9|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sent his five sons to [[Warrington Academy]],&lt;ref&gt;Ben, 1766–73; William, 1766–69; John, 1772–74; Charles, 1775–77; Samuel, 1777–79.

The Society set about dealing with Wilkes's tangled money affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=73620|title=Society of Gentlemen Supporters of the Bill of Rights|first=Nicola|last=Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaughan belonged to what [[Benjamin Franklin]] fondly called the Club of Honest Whigs, which met at St Paul's Coffee-house in St Paul's-churchyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert E Schofield|title="The" Enlightened Joseph Priestley: A Study of His Life and Work from 1773 to 1804|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qL9K2e4KIvsC&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=17 May 2013|year=2004|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-04624-2|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; His support for the cause of [[Corsica]] in 1768 brought him the acquaintance of [[James Boswell]] through the Club.&lt;ref&gt;Verner W.

In December 1774 [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Josiah Quincy II]] stayed with Vaughan at [[Wanstead]] in Essex.&lt;ref name="Quincy2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Josiah Quincy|title=Memoir of the Life of Josiah Quincy, Jun. of Massachusetts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vt6fAsehB1wC&amp;pg=PA252|accessdate=18 May 2013|date=1 June 2009|publisher=Applewood Books|isbn=978-1-4290-1688-9|pages=252–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the period 1781–2 the parliamentary reformer [[Christopher Wyvill]] met radical leaders at Vaughan's house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E. C. Black|title=The Association: British Extra-parliamentary Political Organization, 1769–1793|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A1Sw-IZGLJ4C&amp;pg=PA84|accessdate=18 May 2013|year=1963|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05000-6|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; There resulted a political pact for the following session of parliament, of mutual support between Wyvill and a radical group around Vaughan (including [[John Jebb (reformer)|John Jebb]], [[John Horne Tooke]], and [[James Townsend (Lord Mayor of London)|James Townsend]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John M. Norris |title=Shelburne and Reform |year=1963 |publisher=Macmillan |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaughan joined the [[Society for Constitutional Information]] in the 1780s.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 43 note 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Through William Beckford, he met the [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Earl of Shelburne]]. When Shelburne became Prime Minister, the Vaughan family influence reached foreign policy, trying to split the United States from their French allies in some ultimately unsuccessful moves of 1782.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John M. Norris |title=Shelburne and Reform |year=1963 |publisher=Macmillan |pages= 58 and 165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vaughan family was part of the congregation of the dissenting minister [[Richard Price]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amphilsoc.org/mole/view?docId=ead/Mss.B.V462-ead.xml amphilsoc.org, ''John Vaughan papers, 1768 – Circa 1936''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Vaughan was a friend of the elder [[William Hazlitt (Unitarian minister)|William Hazlitt]], the Unitarian minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=95498|title=Hazlitt, William|first=Duncan|last=Wu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaughan's religious views have been described as "free-thinking Unitarian".&lt;ref name="Ryden"&gt;{{cite book |author=David Beck Ryden |title=West Indian Slavery and British Abolition |year=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521486590 |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jamaica and bribery scandal==
Vaughan purchased in 1765 the post of Clerk to the [[Supreme Court of Jamaica]]. In 1769 Vaughan then offered the [[Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton|Duke of Grafton]], a government minister, a sum of £5000 to secure a reversion, to hold this official place in the family for three of his sons.&lt;ref name="Bos"/&gt; Grafton brought a [[King's Bench]] case against Vaughan, which resulted in embarrassment to both parties. The prominence of the issue led the campaigning writer [[Junius]] to expose a previous sale of office by Grafton. This was the post of Collector of Customs in [[Exeter]], to a Mr. Hine, for which Grafton took £3,500; and the implication was that the money went to a card-sharp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bernard Falk |title= The Royal Fitz Roys|year=1950 |publisher=Hutchinson |page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaughan put his side of the case in ''An Appeal to the Public on Behalf of Samuel Vaughan, Esq. in a fall and impartial Narrative of his Negotiation with the Duke of Grafton'';&lt;ref name="Bos"/&gt; and Grafton dropped the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Lee Bradshaw|title=Thomas Bradshaw (1733–1774): A Georgian Politician in the Time of the American Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GHorngsRYdAC&amp;pg=PA90|accessdate=18 May 2013|date=12 August 2011|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=978-1-4653-4479-3|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, Vaughan's actions appeared to be a political gaffe to some of the political radicals, Vaughan's allies. [[Anna Barbauld]], a family friend, wrote a poem complimenting his wife Sarah as a gesture of support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harriet Guest|title=Small Change: Women, Learning, Patriotism, 1750–1810|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nYXIaWSvBTAC&amp;pg=PA233|accessdate=20 May 2013|date=1 December 2000|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-31052-7|page=233 note 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Vaughan's sons became involved in the plantation business, and its London end Vaughan &amp; Co. Benjamin visited Jamaica in the early 1770s, and in parliament in the 1790s defended [[slavery]] on the island. William worked in the company, and became prominent in the London Society of West India Merchants.&lt;ref name="Ryden"/&gt; Vaughan himself visited Jamaica again in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings, American Philosophical Society (vol. 116, No. 3, 1972)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkkLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA270|accessdate=19 May 2013|publisher=American Philosophical Society|isbn=978-1-4223-7123-7|page=270 note 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vaughan estates were Flamstead and Vaughansfield in [[Saint James Parish, Jamaica]], slave-run sugar plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lady Maria Nugent|title=Lady Nugent's Journal of Her Residence in Jamaïca from 1801 to 1805|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yavJoHc3138C&amp;pg=PA242|accessdate=20 May 2013|year=2002|publisher=University Press of the West Indies|isbn=978-976-640-128-3|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaughansfield was involved in the [[Second Maroon War]] in the neighbouring [[Trelawny Parish]].&lt;ref name="Craton2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Craton|title=Testing the Chains: Resistance to Slavery in the British West Indies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qP2jDoiqy3wC&amp;pg=PA214|accessdate=20 May 2013|year=2009|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-7528-3|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel Vaughan junior became proprietor of these estates.&lt;ref name="Ryden"/&gt;

==In the United States==
After the end of the [[American War of Independence]] Vaughan made several long stays in the United States. There were three separate visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hannibal Sheppard|title=Reminiscences of the Vaughan Family: And More Particularly of Benjamin Vaughan, LL.D.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JvUUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA31|accessdate=20 May 2013|year=1865|publisher=D.

===Philadelphia and Virginia===
Vaughan was on good terms with [[George Washington]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Meade Stith Rasmussen|author2=Robert S.

As Vaughan explained to [[Humphry Marshall]], he planned to plant the State House Yard with a representative collection of American trees and shrubs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://specialcollections.nal.usda.gov/vaughan-marshall-may-28-1785-usda-history-collection specialcollections.nal.usda.gov, ''Vaughan to Marshall, May 28, 1785, USDA History Collection''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The ambition was a political statement, on the unity of the newly United States, and was shared by Washington and [[Thomas Jefferson]] as gardeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrea Wulf|authorlink = Andrea Wulf|title=The Founding Gardeners: How the Revolutionary Generation Created an American Eden|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T9KWQslMe9QC&amp;pg=PA84|accessdate=20 May 2013|date=2 April 2012|publisher=Windmill Books|isbn=978-0-09-952562-2|pages=118–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Philadelphia for the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] during the summer of 1787, Vaughan paid a visit in July to [[William Bartram]]'s nursery, from which he ordered 55 species of plants.&lt;ref name="Wulf84"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrea Wulf|authorlink = Andrea Wulf|title=The Founding Gardeners: How the Revolutionary Generation Created an American Eden|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T9KWQslMe9QC&amp;pg=PA84|accessdate=20 May 2013|date=2 April 2012|publisher=Windmill Books|isbn=978-0-09-952562-2|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State House project's greater scope was abandoned, but Vaughan saw to the publication of Marshall's ''Arbustum Americanum'', in 1785.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Ewan, ''Seeds and Ships and Healing Herbs, Encouragers and Kings'', Bartonia No. 45 (1978), pp. 24–29, at pp. 28–29.

In 1787 also, Vaughan visited [[Mount Vernon]], and drew a plan of the garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrea Wulf|authorlink = Andrea Wulf|title=The Founding Gardeners: How the Revolutionary Generation Created an American Eden|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T9KWQslMe9QC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=20 May 2013|date=2 April 2012|publisher=Windmill Books|isbn=978-0-09-952562-2|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave Washington a marble mantelpiece for the house.&lt;ref name="Graham, p. 60"/&gt;

===Maine===
Vaughan also spent time in [[Hallowell, Maine]], meeting up with William Hazlitt there in the winter of 1784–5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Willis Cooke|title=Unitarianism in America: A History of Its Origin and Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fd_KV5GYPZUC&amp;pg=PA51|accessdate=20 May 2013|date=31 December 2007|publisher=Echo Library|isbn=978-1-4068-4830-4|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Vaughan had inherited property on the [[Kennebec River]], from her father, who was a "Kennebeck Proprietor", and also a congregationalist supporter of the [[Brattle Square Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Properly, one of The Proprietors of the Kennebec Purchase from the late Colony of New-Plymouth.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gordon E.

==Later life==
In 1790 Vaughan attended the funeral of his friend Benjamin Franklin. Shortly afterwards he returned to London.&lt;ref name="Graham, p. 60"/&gt; In 1792 he went to Paris to attend debates of the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 344 note 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1795 he bought the "Vaughan portrait", one of many portraits of Washington by [[Gilbert Stuart]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.1121.html nga.gov, ''George Washington (Vaughan portrait)''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seah Eu Chin''' ({{zh|c=佘有進|p=Shé Yǒujìn}}; [[Pseudonym|a.k.a.]] '''Siah U-chin''', '''Seah Uchin''' or '''Seah You Chin'''; 1805{{dash}}1883) was an immigrant from South China to Singapore, later becoming a successful merchant and leader in the [[Overseas Chinese]] community.

He is a prominent descendant of '''[[She (surname)|Seah Clan]]''' in Southeast Asia.

== Early life ==

Seah Eu Chin was born in 1805 as the son of Seah Keng Liat ({{zh|c=佘慶烈|p=Shé Qìngliè}}), a minor provincial official of ''Guek-po'' (i.e. {{zh|"[[:zh:月浦街道|月浦]]"}} in [[Teochew dialect]]) ''Village'' at the [[Chenghai District|Chenghai County]] of the former ''[[Chaozhou]] [[Fu (country subdivision)|Fu]]''. He was educated in Chinese classics in his youth, but decided to seek his fortune abroad. He came to Singapore in 1823, first working as a clerk, then becoming a plantation owner and finally becoming a trader and a merchant.&lt;ref name="SongOngSiang"&gt;{{cite book | last=Song | first=Ong Siang | author-link=Song Ong Siang | title=One Hundred Years' History of the Chinese in Singapore | publisher=John Murray | date=1923 | location=London | language=English | url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/printheritage/download.aspx?id=f8082431-1c7b-460e-b59c-bbc5793035a3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}}

== Plantation and mercantile activity ==

Seah Eu Chin was a successful plantation owner. He was the first to plant [[Gambier (extract)|gambier]] (or white cutch) on a large scale in Singapore. By 1839, his gambier plantation had stretched for eight to ten miles, from the upper end of River Valley Road to Bukit Timah Road and Thomson Road. Mr Seah's holdings earned him the title: 'King of Gambier'. He made his fortune in gambier and [[Black pepper|pepper]] plantations. However, by the 1850s–60s, the planting of gambier and pepper was becoming less profitable in Singapore for several reasons, including the increasing scarcity of uncleared land for planting (gambier quickly exhausted the soil and so plantations had to keep shifting), the shortage of firewood from the clearing of forests, and the lack of land on Singapore Island itself.

Therefore, in his later years, he became involved in trading as a merchant and agent under the name of Eu Chin Co. which was based in North Bridge Road. His sons, especially the eldest, Seah Cheo Seah, and second son [[Seah Liang Seah]], helped manage the business, as did his brother-in-law, Tan Seng Poh.

==Family life==

In 1837, he married a daughter of [[Tan Ah Hun]], the [[Kapitan Cina|Kapitan (Captain) China]] (i.e. leader of the Chinese community) of [[Perak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Wong | first =Choon-san | title =A gallery of Chinese kapitans | publisher =Dewan Bahasa dan Kebudayaan Kebangsaan | date =1963 | location =Singapore | language =English}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died soon after from the effects of [[smallpox]], and about a year later, he married her sister with whom he had several children. His brother-in-law, [[Tan Seng Poh]], came with his sister to Singapore to be educated there. Seng Poh was an [[opium]] and spirit farmer (i.e. he ran a government-tendered monopoly processing raw [[opium]] imported from [[British India]]. The Opium and Spirit [[Farm (revenue leasing)|Farm]], or Excise, was the main source of income for the Straits Settlements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Trocki |first=Carl A. |author-link=Carl A. Trocki |date=1990 |title=Opium and empire :  Chinese society in Colonial Singapore, 1800-1910 |location=Ithaca, New York |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=0801423902}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and helped manage Eu Chin's mercantile firm after the latter's retirement in 1864. Most prominent among his children were [[Seah Liang Seah]] and [[Seah Peck Seah]], both of whom also became Justices of the Peace and prominent members of the Chinese community; the former was also an unofficial member of the [[Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements]]. His eldest son, Seah Cheo Seah, was also a J.P. but he died only two years after his father, in 1885. He had another son, Seah Song Seah, who died in China, and three daughters, about whom very little is known.&lt;ref name="SongOngSiang" /&gt;{{rp|21}}

== Community leadership ==

In 1830, he and representatives of twelve Teochew clans set up the Ngee Ann Kun which later became the [[Ngee Ann Kongsi]] in 1845. He was the chairman of the Kongsi until his death whereupon power passed to his sons Seah Cheo Seah and Seah Liang Seah, followed by his grandson Seah Eng Tong, resulting in a Seah monopoly on power in the Kongsi until 1928. Resentment against them caused the formation of another Teochew clan association, the [[Teochew Poit Ip Huay Kuan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last=Yen |first=Ching-hwang |title=A social history of the Chinese in Singapore and Malaya 1800-1911 |location=Singapore |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1986 |isbn= 0195826663 |pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seah Eu Chin helped run [[Tan Tock Seng Hospital]] when it was first set up, being a member, and in some years treasurer, of its management committee.

Just as the European merchant community used Chinese middlemen in conducting their business, the [[Straits Settlements]] government relied on prominent Chinese businessmen to act as go-betweens with the Chinese community. Seah Eu Chin was the go-between with the Teochew community, which originated from the [[Chaozhou]] province of Southern China. He rendered service in helping to quell several disturbances in the community, most notably the 1854 Hokkien-Teochew Riots which broke out on 5 May 1854. The incident ostensibly began because of a dispute over the price of rice, between a [[Hokkien]] and a Teochew, but that dispute probably was only a trigger for the release of long-held resentment and animosity between the Hokkien (from [[Fujian]] province in China) and Teochew (from Chaozhou province) communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Yong |first=Chun Yuan | title =Hokkien-Teochew Riots (1854) | encyclopedia =Singapore Infopedia | publisher =National Library Board, Singapore | date =2016 | url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_104_2005-01-25.html | access-date =2017-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In all over 400 people were killed over 10 days of violence. The British authorities on Singapore island met with Chinese leaders, including Seah Eu Chin representing Teochews and [[Tan Kim Ching]] representing the Hokkiens, and with their assistance helped to bring the situation to a close.

He was an early member of the [[Singapore Chamber of Commerce]], established in 1837, and was made a [[Justice of the Peace]] in 1867. He had also been a member of the [[Grand Jury]] since 1851, and also had cases involving Chinese referred to him by the court. In 1872, he was made an honorary police magistrate, along with four other Chinese including his brother-in-law Tan Seng Poh.

== Last years ==

Seah Eu Chin finally retired from business in 1864, to concentrate on scholarly pursuits, though he still had an interest in community affairs. For instance, his name is with that of several other Chinese on a petition submitted to the government requesting the suppression of illegal "Wah-Weh" gambling among the Chinese community. In the last decade of his life he lived in a mansion built by his son Seah Cheo Seah that was among the [[Four Mansions]] ({{lang-zh|c=四大厝|p=Sì dà cuò}}) of the 19th-century Chinese in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=马来亚丛谈|last=Hsu|first=Yun-tsiao|publisher=Youth Book Co.|year=2005|isbn=9810540213|location=Singapore|pages=115-124|orig-year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 23 September 1883, and his widow in 1905.&lt;ref name="SongOngSiang" /&gt;{{rp|22}} He was buried in the family estate near the SLF Building along [[Thomson Road, Singapore|Thomson Road]]. His tomb was re-discovered in late 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Boon | first =Rachel | title =Teochew pioneer's grave found in Toa Payoh | newspaper =Straits Times | location =Singapore | language =English | date =2012-11-28 | url =http://www.asiaone.com/print/News/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20121126-385931.html | access-date =2017-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several streets in Singapore are named for Seah Eu Chin and his sons, namely Eu Chin Street, Liang Seah Street, and Peck Seah Street. Seah Street, in [[Bras Basah]], is named for the Seah family.

'''Semantic Intelligence''' is the ability to gather the necessary information to allow to identify, detect and solve [[semantic gap]]s on all level of the organization.

Similar to [[Operational Intelligence]] or [[Operational Intelligence|Business Process Intelligence]], which aims to identify, detect and then optimize business processes, semantic intelligence targets information instead of processes. It aims to enable better understanding and insight in data by all stakeholders. This will support better information sharing, reuse and governance and support better business decision-making.

== Semantic Gap ==

Several types of semantic gaps can be identified:
# The semantic gap between different data sources - structured or unstructured
# The semantic gap between the operational data and the human interpretation of this data
# The semantic gap between people communicating about a certain information concept.

One application of semantic intelligence is the management of [[unstructured information]], leveraging [[semantic technology]]. These applications tackle R&amp;D, sales, marketing and security for activities that include [[Knowledge Management]], [[Customer Care]] and [[Corporate Intelligence]].

Several applications aim to detect and solve different types of semantic gaps. They range from [[search engine]]s to automatic categorizers, from [[ETL system]]s to [[natural language]] interfaces, special functionality include [[dashboard]]s and [[text mining]].

One approach that aims to provide a holistic solution to achieve semantic intelligence is [[Business semantics management]]. Instead of focusing on very specific type of semantic gap (i.e. unstructured data), it aims to provide a whole solution to align business and it to share the understanding and semantics of information concepts.

== History ==

In 2002, the software company [[Expert System S.p.A.]] started to popularize Semantic Intelligence as a term to describe a new generation of information access technology applications based on semantic analysis. In opposition to standard systems to process unstructured information (such as keyword based systems), semantic intelligence applications focus on the meaning of the texts.

In 2008, the software company [[Collibra]] started commercializing years of academic research on semantic technology. It has positioned its [[Business semantics management]] approach as a way to achieve Semantic Intelligence.

'''Sergey Viktorovich Chemezov''' ({{lang-ru|Серге́й Ви́кторович Чéмезов}}; born 20 August 1952) is the [[CEO]] of [[Rostec|Rostec Corporation]] (formerly the Director General of Rosoboronexport), chairman of the Union of Russian Mechanical Engineers, and a lieutenant-general.

==Biography==
Chemezov was born on 20 August 1952 in the city of Cheremkhovo in [[Irkutsk Oblast]].

Chemezov graduated with honours from Irkutsk Institute of National Economy (presently Baikal State University of Economics and Law)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Rostec]]|accessdate=18 September 2013|url=http://www.rostec.ru/careers/university/1867|title=Baikal State University of Economics and Law|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131121075200/http://www.rostec.ru/careers/university/1867|archivedate=21 November 2013|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1975 and then completed his postgraduate education at the [[Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia]]. Chemezov has a doctorate in economics and is also a professor and full member of the Military Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rostec.ru/about/board/person/396|title=Sergey Viktorovich Chemezov|publisher=[[Rostec]]|accessdate=18 September 2013|deadurl=no|archivedate=13 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813143848/http://www.rostec.ru/about/board/person/396|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Irkutsk Scientific and Research Institute of Rare and Nonferrous Metals, Chemezov worked as an engineer, a research associate, and chief laboratory assistant. From 1980 to 1988, he worked at “Luch” Research-Industrial Association. From 1983 to 1988, Chemezov served as the head&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|title=Sergey Viktorovich Chemezov|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=27199601&amp;ticker=AVAZP:RU|deadurl=no|archivedate=28 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428154655/http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=27199601&amp;ticker=AVAZP:RU|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Luch Association representative office in [[East Germany]], where he met [[Vladimir Putin]] and [[Nikolay Tokarev]]. Nikolay Tokarev, Chemezov, and Vladimir Putin worked for their [[KGB]] boss [[Lazar Matveev]] while in East Germany and both Chermazov and Putin lived in the same block of flats in [[Dresden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Putin visits his former KGB boss on his 90th birthday (VIDEO)  | url = https://www.rt.com/viral/387578-putin-kgb-boss-birthday/ | work = RT | date = 8 May 2017 | access-date = 9 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There they became friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/9682621|title=The making of a neo-KGB state|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=23 August 2007|accessdate=18 September 2013|place=[[Moscow]]|archivedate=9 October 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009032052/http://www.economist.com/node/9682621|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1988 to 1996, Chemezov was deputy CEO of the “Sovintersport” Foreign Trade Association. From 1996 to 1999, he was chairman of the Department for Foreign Economic Relations within the Office for Presidential Affairs, serving under Vladimir Putin. Later he transitioned to the position of chairman of the Department for Foreign Economic Relations of the [[Presidential Administration of Russia]].

From September 1999 to November 2000, Chemezov served as CEO of Promexport. In August 2000, he became a member of the Presidential Committee on Military and Engineering Cooperation between Russia and Foreign Countries.

From November 2000 to April 2004, Chemezov served as first deputy CEO of Rosoboronexport and then as its CEO from 2004 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Fred Weir|accessdate=18 September 2013|date=12 February 2007|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0212/p04s01-woeu.html|title=Russia intensifies efforts to rebuild its military machine|publisher=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|archivedate=28 October 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028151522/http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0212/p04s01-woeu.html|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By a decree of the Russian President, on 26 November 2007, Chemezov was named CEO of Russian Technologies Corporation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-19/russian-technologies-can-t-be-privatized-chemezov-update1-.html|author=Henry Meyer|title=Russian Technologies Can’t Be Privatized: Chemezov|journal=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date=19 November 2010|accessdate=18 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428224228/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-19/russian-technologies-can-t-be-privatized-chemezov-update1-.html|archivedate=28 April 2014|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was renamed Rostec in late 2012.

At the 6th [[United Russia]] party convention held on 2 December 2006, Chemezov was elected to the party’s Supreme Council. At the 7th party convention on 26 May 2012, Chemezov was reelected.

Chemezov coordinates United Russia’s “IT-Breakout” project, which since December 2010 has sought to discover and support outstanding young [[Information technology|IT]] innovators.

On 28 April 2014, he was barred by the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] from entering the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/04/28/u-s-announces-new-sanctions-on-russians-whos-on-the-list/|title=U.S. announces new sanctions on Russians: Who’s on the list|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|author=Terri Rupar|date=28 April 2014|accessdate= 21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''SimPark''''' is a 1996 [[video game]] by [[Maxis]]. The object of the game is to cultivate and manage a successful [[park]]. Similar to ''[[SimTown]]'', it is targeted more towards [[child]]ren than the average player.  ''SimPark'' attempts to show the importance of [[ecology|ecological]] balance. It could well be considered a 'lite' version of ''[[SimIsle: Missions in the Rainforest|SimIsle]]''.

== Gameplay ==
[[Image:Simpark.jpeg|thumb|left|''SimPark'' screenshot]]
Players have to quickly learn how doing (or not doing) various things will affect how their park grows.  For instance, if certain [[flower]] types aren't planted, the park won't attract [[bee]]s.  If the bees aren't flying around the park, then [[pollination]] won't occur, which is an important aspect of keeping the park growing.  On top of properly managing the [[plant]] and [[animal]] population, players are also required to identify the park's plants and animals.

Players often receive in-game email, such as their boss telling them to make the park more diverse, or their virtual mother telling about life back at home (e.g.: "I baked you a cake..." etc.) Occasionally, the Boss's pet frog Rizzo will make an appearance on the screen to give the player advice, or nag about the way they're handling things.

The park can experience disasters, including:
*[[Waste|Garbage]] Dump: The Garbage Dump is just a big pile of rubbish. As soon as it is made, rats start to produce from it and inhabit your park. The only way to get rid of the garbage dump is to put water on it or place lots of garbage-eating animals such as rats and black bears, around the garbage dump.
*[[Fire]]
* [[Kudzu]]
* [[Alien invasion]]: The Alien Invasion consists of flat, pink-and-blue creatures that litter the park grounds and sometimes float on the water. If the map is clicked to get a zoomed-out map view, the pattern the Aliens form may be in the shape of letters. One example of this is a message which reads: "Surrender, Dorothy". This is a parody of the movie ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. The only way to get rid of aliens, aside from using cheat codes, is to bulldoze them with the "[[Bulldozer]]" tool.

The option of using a microphone feature allows you to click on park-goers and listen to what they have to say. Some of the more memorable quotes include, "My socks don't match," "I didn't brush my teeth this morning," "Eddie! Oh Eddie! Where are you?" and "My favourite book is ''Wind in the Willows."

'''Test management tools''' are used to store information on how testing is to be done, plan testing activities and report the status of quality assurance activities. The tools have different approaches to testing and thus have different sets of features. Generally they are used to maintain and plan manual testing, run or gather execution data from automated tests, manage multiple environments and to enter information about found defects. Test management tools offer the prospect of streamlining the testing process and allow quick access to data analysis, collaborative tools and easy communication across multiple project teams. Many test management tools incorporate [[requirements management]] capabilities to streamline test case design from the requirements. Tracking of defects and project tasks are done within one application to further simplify the testing.

==Structuring the test process==
Test management tools give teams the ability to consolidate and structure the test process using one test management tool, instead of installing multiple applications that are designed to manage only one step of the process. Test management tools allow teams to manage test case environments, automated tests, defects and project tasks. Some applications include advanced dashboards and detailed tracking of key metrics, allowing for easy tracking of progress and bug management.

==Implementation==
A test management tool that includes everything needed to manage the test process can save testers
the hassle of installing separate applications that are necessary for the testing process. They can be implemented with minimal programming ability, allowing for easy installation and monitoring of the test process across multiple project groups. Once installed, teams have instant access to a user interface and can immediately start running and recording test cases. These types of applications are designed to simplify the test management process with high levels of automation and tracking built in, yet don't require advanced programming skills or knowledge to implement. They are useful for teams who manage a variety of test cases and for larger teams who need an all-inclusive application for project management.

==Using==
Once a project has kicked off, a test management tool tracks bug status, defects and projects tasks, and allows for collaboration across the team. When administering test cases, users can access a variety of dashboards to gain access to data instantly, making the test process efficient and accurate. The type of dashboard used is determined by the scope of the project and the information and data that needs to be extracted during the testing process. Data can be shared and accessed across multiple project teams, allowing for effective communication and collaboration throughout the testing process.
