'''Adarsana''' refers to the real non-seeing of objects which already exist; it refers to the ignorance of factual existence of things. This term figures prominently in the [[Yoga]] school of thought, and in [[Jain philosophy]].

==Meaning==
'''Adarsana''' or ''adarshan'' in [[Sanskrit]] as an adjective means latent or invisible, and as a noun it means non-vision, disregard, non-appearance, neglect, latent condition disappearance, not-seeing. It also means ''agyan'' and ''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]]''. Vaidyanath Shastri citing Sl. 2.25 and Sl. 3.55 of Vyasa Bhashya writes that by understanding the non-seeing of objects that exist one understands the seeing of those objects and comes to know about the reality of them. ''Darsana'' means seeing. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dasana-tattva-viveka|author=Vaidyanath Shastri|publisher=Urmila Devi Shastri|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zb0MAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%A8&amp;dq=%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%A8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-wdIUfb0MIrUrQeoroHoCQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[Pāṇini|Panini]], in his [[Ashtadhyayi]] (Sutra 1.1.60 and 61), has given its meaning as - disappearance, invisibility, elision of an object, which fact is denoted by ''luk'', ''shlu'' and ''lup''; ''lup'' refers to real non-seeing which already exists. In other words, Adarsana refers to the ignorance of factual existence of things.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ashtadhyayi of Panini|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSDakY97XckC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ARtIUZaNDIaNrgfb_4HADg&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ayurveda]], the term, ''adarsana'', means visual errors and blindness that results in not seeing the objects that already exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ayurveda Kriya Sarira|author=Yogesh Chandra Mishra|publisher=Chaukhmaba Publications|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5WvHFWXI2aEC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ARtIUZaNDIaNrgfb_4HADg&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Puranas]], ''Adarsana'' is the mind-born mother it is so said because the act of seeing and the act of not seeing or non-seeing is an activity of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bal Ramayan|author=Krishnadutta Bharadwaj|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rmqe3AGz5fUC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;lr=&amp;cd=23#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication==
The term, ''adarsana'', as a technical term in [[Yoga]] referring to ignorance or absence of knowledge, figures prominently in the discussions pertaining to the ''Sadhanapada'' of [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]. [[Patanjali]] systemised the [[Yoga]] [[philosophy]] or Yoga- darsana propounded by Acarya [[Hiranyagarbha]] which is the practical application of [[Samkhya]] principles earlier systemised through twenty two sutras by [[Kapila]]. ''Vyasa-bhasya'' which is Vyasa’s commentary on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali has been commented upon by [[Vachaspati Misra]] and Vigyanabhikshu. Vyasa states that liberation consists precisely in the cessation of the mind which cessation occurs by the disappearance of the cause of misconception or ''adarsana'' while adding that correct vision of reality ([[darsana]]) stops or sublates misconception which is the cause of bondage. Vyasa explains that ''adarsana'' is the particular conjunction of ''avidya'' in relation to the inward individual consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Silence Unheard|author=Yohanan Grinspon|publisher=SUNY Press|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1EQrFx0zCIC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vyasa in his commentary on Sadhanapada of Yoga Sutras elaborately discusses and explains the concept of adarsana. Therefore, ''Adarsana'' or wrong conception or contrary knowledge is that contact of the [[Purusa]] with the [[Guna]]s in which the ''Gunas'' serve as objects of ''Purusa''. The modification of the mind in the shape of experience of pleasure and pain is ''adarsana''. ''Adarsana'' ceases on attainment of discriminative knowledge that gradually leads to ''[[Kaivalya]]'' or liberation. It is also known as the power which manifests as knowing (''darsana''), or as the characteristic of both the knower (''Purusa'') and the knowable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yoga Darsana of Patanjali|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|page=144|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyB4NbDYQ18C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FQ5IUY6eFoXxrQfwoIDQAQ&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application as per Yoga School of thought==
The Yoga School of [[Hindu]] Philosophy considers ''Adarsana'' as the sway i.e. proneness to ''Gunas'', which sway lasts till the ''Gunas'' are activeand that it is non-production of the primary mind. The primary mind is that which ceases to function after presenting the objects of experience and discernment to the owner, the Seer. The mind that ceases to function when right knowledge and aversion to objects of enjoyment through renunciation takes place is the primary mind. This school of thought also views ''Adarsana'' as the existence of experience and liberation in a latent state as the latency of ''Avidya'' or wrong knowledge or want of discrimination which is the cause of alliance of ''[[Buddhi]]'' and ''[[Purusa]]'' and its co-existing ''adarsana''.  ''Adarsana'' is ''[[Pradhana]]'' which has a dual nature i.e. it is static and also fluctuating and it is the cognitive faculty because ''Pradhana'' has the tendency to fluctuate and which tendency is stored as potential energy, ''adarsana''. Thus, this school considers ''Adarsana'' to be the characteristic of both ''Pradhana'' and ''Purusa'' as a particular form of cognition, as all knowledge except discriminatory knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali|publisher= SUNY Press|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=58ndiC9MpMYC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FQ5IUY6eFoXxrQfwoIDQAQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vyasa in his commentary on [[Yoga Sutra]] II.23 tells us that ''adarsana'' is the failure to see or ignorance (''avidya''). Patanjali in his ''Yoga Sutra'' II.24 does explain that the cause of identification (''samyoga'') of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], the experiencer, with ''[[Prakrti]]'', the object of experience, i.e. bondage, is ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana|author=Ian Wicher|publisher=SUNY Press|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Qo9K9hPvQgC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FQ5IUY6eFoXxrQfwoIDQAQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''adarsana'' ceases, the alliance of ''[[Buddhi]]'' and ''[[Purusa]]'' that causes misery ceases and there is complete cessation of bondage for all time, the state of aloofness of ''Purusa'' and non-occurrence of future contact with the ''Gunas'' ensues. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali|publisher= SUNY Press|page=198|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=58ndiC9MpMYC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FQ5IUY6eFoXxrQfwoIDQAQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist view==
But, [[Dharmakirti]], the [[Buddhist]] philosopher, states that pervasion cannot be founded on the observation of ''[[darsana]]'' (co-presence) or the observation of ''adarsana'' (co-absence) which is the view held also by the [[Caravaka]]s and the [[Jain]]s, because identity and causation are the only acceptable grounds of pervasion, unless two things are related in one of these ways, there can be no necessity and no pervasion, and non-difference implies essential identity in spite of the difference in cognitive contents of the two expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Definition and Induction|author=Kisor Kumar Chakrabarti|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|page=151|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0reCO392BAC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yxtJUYPUB8rhrAeD5YC4DQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAzgy#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jain belief==

In [[Jainism]], the term, ''adarsana'', indicates the condition of mental unease and the suffering of loss of faith resulting from the failure in achieving the desired highest goal after long ''[[sadhana]]'', ''[[tapas]]'' etc., which negative feeling does not affect one who has transcended anger, violence, jealousy, waywardness, bad or evil intentions, untruth, and who is disciplined and adopting the ''Brahmacharya Dharma'' has forsaken his household or family-life, all desires for possession of things and readily donates whatever is possessed by him. The overcoming of this negative feeling is called ''Adarsana-vijay''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pracheen Bharatiya Dharm Evam Darshan|author=Shivswaroop Sahay|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQXqEUyr6t4C&amp;pg=PT199&amp;dq=%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%A8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-wdIUfb0MIrUrQeoroHoCQ&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other application==
According to [[Baudhayana]], [[Aryavarta]] lies west of Kalakavana, east of Adarsana, south of the [[Himalayas]] and north of the [[Vindhyas]]. Dharamsutra II.2.16 speaks of ''Vinasana'' as Adarsana, the western boundary of Aryavarta &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Ancient Geography Vol. 1|author= Subodh kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=43Fzt-G_-XYC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=adarsana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VhlJUcahDcWPrgebuIGgCA&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=adarsana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11175">'''Bertrand competition''' is a model of competition used in economics, named after [[Joseph Louis François Bertrand]] (1822–1900). It describes interactions among firms (sellers) that set prices and their customers (buyers) that choose quantities at the prices set.  The model was formulated in 1883 by Bertrand in a review of [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]]'s book ''Recherches sur les Principes Mathématiques de la Théorie des Richesses'' (1838) in which Cournot had put forward the [[Cournot model]].&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand, J. (1883) "Book review of theorie mathematique de la richesse sociale and of recherches sur les principles mathematiques de la theorie des richesses", Journal de Savants 67: 499–508&lt;/ref&gt; Cournot argued that when firms choose quantities, the equilibrium outcome involves firms pricing above marginal cost and hence the competitive price. In his review, Bertrand argued that if firms chose prices rather than quantities, then the competitive outcome would occur with price equal to marginal cost. The model was not formalized by Bertrand: however, the idea was developed into a mathematical model by [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Edgeworth, Francis (1889) “The pure theory of monopoly”, reprinted in Collected Papers relating to Political Economy 1925, vol.1, Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

The model rests on very specific assumptions. There are at least two firms producing a homogeneous (undifferentiated) product and cannot cooperate in any way. Firms compete by setting prices simultaneously and consumers want to buy everything from a firm with a lower price (since the product is homogeneous and there are no consumer search costs). If two firms charge the same price, consumers' demand is split evenly between them. It is simplest to concentrate on the case of [[duopoly]] where there are just two firms, although the results hold for  any number of firms greater than 1.

A crucial assumption about the technology is that both firms have the same constant unit cost of production, so that marginal and average costs are the same and equal to the competitive price. This means that as long as the price it sets is above unit cost, the firm is willing to supply any amount that is demanded (it earns profit on each unit sold). If price is equal to unit cost, then it is indifferent to how much it sells, since it earns no profit. Obviously, the firm will never want to set a price below unit cost, but if it did it would not want to sell anything since it would lose money on each unit sold.

==The Bertrand duopoly equilibrium==
Why is the competitive price a [[Nash equilibrium]] in the Bertrand model? First, if both firms set the competitive price with price equal to marginal cost (unit cost), neither firm will earn any profits. However, if one firm sets price equal to marginal cost, then if the other firm raises its price above unit cost, then it will earn nothing, since all consumers will buy from the firm still setting the competitive price (recall that it is willing to meet unlimited demand at price equals unit cost even though it earns no profit). No other price is an equilibrium. If both firms set the same price above unit cost and share the market, then each firm has an incentive to undercut the other by an arbitrarily small amount and capture the whole market and almost double its profits. So there can be no equilibrium with both firms setting the same price above marginal cost. Also, there can be no equilibrium with firms setting different prices. The firms setting the higher price will earn nothing (the lower priced firm serves all of the customers). Hence the higher priced firm will want to lower its price to undercut the lower-priced firm. Hence the ''only'' equilibrium in the Bertrand model occurs when both firms set price equal to unit cost (the competitive price).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Narahari | first1=Y. | year=2009 | title=Game Theoretic Problems in Network Economics and Mechanism Design Solutions | last2=Garg | first2=Dinesh | last3=Narayanam | first3=Ramasuri | last4=Prakash | first4=Hastagiri | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | isbn=978-1-84800-937-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7zxVKFmk24C&amp;pg=PA21 | page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the Bertrand equilibrium is a ''weak'' Nash-equilibrium. The firms lose nothing by deviating from the competitive price: it is an equilibrium simply because each firm can earn no more than zero profits given that the other firm sets the competitive price and is willing to meet all demand at that price.

== Calculating the classic Bertrand model ==
*MC = constant [[marginal cost]] (equals constant unit cost of production).
*p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = firm 1’s price level
*p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = firm 2’s price level
*p&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = monopoly price level

Firm 1's optimum price depends on where it believes firm 2 will set its prices. Pricing just below the other firm will obtain full market demand (D), though this is not optimal if the other firm is pricing below marginal cost as that would entail negative profits. In general terms, firm 1's [[best response]] function is p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;’’(p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), this gives firm 1 optimal price for each price set by firm 2.

Diagram 1 shows firm 1’s reaction function p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;’’(p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), with each firm's strategy on each axis. It shows that when P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is less than marginal cost (firm 2 pricing below MC) firm 1 prices at marginal cost, p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=MC. When firm 2 prices above MC but below monopoly prices, then firm 1 prices just below firm 2. When firm 2 prices above monopoly prices (P&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt;) firm 1 prices at monopoly level, p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=p&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[File:economics bertrand diag1.png]]

Because firm 2 has the same marginal cost as firm 1, its reaction function is symmetrical with respect to the 45 degree line. Diagram 2 shows both reaction functions.

[[File:economics bertrand diag2.png]]

The result of the firms' strategies is a [[Nash equilibrium]], that is, a pair of strategies (prices in this case) where neither firm can increase profits by unilaterally changing price. This is given by the intersection of the reaction curves, Point N on the diagram. At this point p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;’’(p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;’’(p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). As you can see, point N on the diagram is where both firms are pricing at marginal cost.

Another way of thinking about it, a simpler way, is to imagine if both firms set equal prices above marginal cost, firms would get half the market at a higher than MC price. However, by lowering prices just slightly, a firm could gain the whole market, so both firms are tempted to lower prices as much as they can. It would be irrational to price below marginal cost, because the firm would make a loss. Therefore, both firms will lower prices until they reach the MC limit.

If one firm has lower average cost (a superior [[production function|production technology]]), it will charge the highest price that is lower than the average cost of the other one (i.e. a price ''just'' below the lowest price the other firm can manage) and take all the business. This is known as [[limit price|"limit pricing"]]

== Critical analysis of the Bertrand model ==

The Bertrand model rests on some very extreme assumptions. For example, it assumes that consumers want to buy from the lowest priced firm. There are various reasons why this may not hold in many markets: non-price competition and [[product differentiation]], transport and [[Price dispersion|search costs]]. For example, would someone travel twice as far to save 1% on the price of their vegetables? The Bertrand model can be extended to include product or location differentiation but then the main result – that price is driven down to marginal cost – no longer holds. With search costs, there may be other equilibria apart from the competitive price – the monopoly price or even price dispersion may be equilibria as in the classic "Bargains and Rip-offs" model.&lt;ref&gt;Salop S and Stiglitz J (1977) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2296903  Bargains and Ripoffs: A Model of Monopolistically Competitive Price Dispersion], The Review of Economic Studies, Vol. 44, No. 3 (Oct., 1977), pp. 493–510&lt;/ref&gt;

The model also ignores capacity constraints. If a single firm does not have the capacity to supply the whole market then the "price equals marginal cost" result may not hold. The analysis of this case was started by [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]] and has become known as the [[Bertrand–Edgeworth model]]. With capacity constraints, there may not exist any pure strategy Nash equilibrium, the so-called [[Edgeworth paradox]]. However, in general there will exist a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium as shown by [[Huw Dixon]]&lt;ref&gt;Dixon H (1984) [http://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecolet/v16y1984i3-4p205-212.html The existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in a price-setting oligopoly with convex costs], Economics Letters, volume 16, pages 205–212.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a big incentive to cooperate in the Bertrand model: [[collusion|colluding]] to charge the [[monopoly]] price and sharing the market each is the best that the firms could do in this set up. However not colluding and charging [[marginal cost]], is the non-cooperative outcome and the only [[Nash equilibrium]] of this model. If we move from a one-shot game to a repeated game, then perhaps collusion can persist for some time or emerge.

==Bertrand competition versus Cournot competition==
Neither model is necessarily "better" than the other. The accuracy of the predictions of each model will vary from industry to industry, depending on the closeness of each model to the industry situation. If capacity and output can be easily changed, Bertrand is generally a better model of duopoly competition. If output and capacity are difficult to adjust, then Cournot is generally a better model.
Under some conditions the Cournot model can be recast as a two-stage model, where in the first stage firms choose capacities, and in the second they compete in Bertrand fashion.

Bertrand predicts a duopoly is enough to push prices down to marginal cost level; a duopoly will result in an outcome exactly equivalent to what prevails under [[perfect competition]].

[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|[[Gottfried Leibniz]], the philosopher who coined the term "best of all possible worlds" in his 1710 work ''[[Théodicée]]''.]]
{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |challenges}}

The phrase "'''the best of all possible worlds'''" ({{lang-fr|le meilleur des mondes possibles}}; {{lang-de|Die beste aller möglichen Welten}}) was coined by the [[German people|German]] [[polymath]] [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in his 1710 work ''[[Théodicée|Essais de Théodicée sur la bonté de Dieu, la liberté de l'homme et l'origine du mal]]'' (''Essays of Theodicy on the Goodness of God, the Freedom of Man and the Origin of Evil''). The claim that the actual world is the best of all possible worlds is the central argument in Leibniz's [[theodicy]], or his attempt to solve the [[problem of evil]].

==Problem of evil==
{{main|Problem of evil}}
Among his many philosophical interests and concerns, Leibniz took on this question of theodicy: If [[God]] is [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]], [[omnipotence|omnipotent]] and [[omniscience|omniscient]], how do we account for the suffering and injustice that exists in the world? Historically, attempts to answer the question have been made using various arguments, for example, by explaining away evil or reconciling evil with good.

Leibniz outlined his perfect world theory in his work ''[[Monadology|The Monadology]]'', stating the argument in five statements: 
# God has the idea of infinitely many universes.
# Only one of these universes can actually exist.
# God's choices are subject to the principle of sufficient reason, that is, God has reason to choose one thing or another.
# God is good.
# Therefore, the universe that God chose to exist is the best of all possible worlds.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discourse on Metaphysics and Other Essays|last=Leibniz|first=Gottfried|publisher=Daniel Garber and Roger Ariew|year=1991|isbn=0872201325|location=Indianapolis|pages=53–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To further understand his argument, these five statements can be grouped in three main premises. The first premise (corresponding to the first and second statements) state that God can only choose one universe from the infinite amount of possible universes.  (The term "one universe" does not necessarily mean a single three-dimensional physical reality, but refers to the sum total of God's creation, and thus might include [[Multiverse|multiple worlds]].)  The second premise (the third and fourth statements) state that God is a perfect existence, and he makes decisions based on reason. The third premise (the fifth statement) concludes that the existing world, chosen by God, is the best.

Leibniz used [[Christianity]] to back up the validity of all the premises. For the first premise, God's existence and role as the creator of the world was proven by the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://colintemple.com/2012/03/best-possible-world-leibniz/|title=Leibniz: The Best of All Possible Worlds|date=2012-03-01|website=Colin Temple|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second premise is proven since "God acts always in the most perfect and most desirable manner possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rationalists: René Descartes, translated by John Veitch: Discourse on method, Meditations |last=Descartes |last2=Spinoza |last3=Leibniz |first=René |first2=Benedictus |first3=Gottfried|publisher=Doubleday|year=1960|pages=412}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, His choice will always be the best, and only perfect existence can make perfect decision throughout time. Since all the premises are right, then Leibniz concluded, "The universe that God chose to exist is the best of all possible worlds".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To set his argument, Leibniz wrestled with the problem of sin and evil in the world that obviously exists and is considered as the imperfection of the world. Leibniz, in this letter said, "I do not believe that a world without evil, preferable in order to ours, is possible; otherwise it would have been preferred. It is necessary to believe that the mixture of evil has produced the greatest possible good: otherwise the evil would not have been permitted".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Shorter Leibniz Texts: A Collection of New Translations|last=Leibniz|first=Gottfried|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|year=2006|isbn=9780826489517}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, if a world without evil is more perfect in any way, then evil would have not happened, and the world without evil would be our world instead. God put evilness in the world for us to understand goodness which is achieved through contrasting it with evil. Once we understood evil and good, it gives us the ability to produce the "greatest possible good" out of all the goodness. Evil fuels goodness, which leads to a perfect system.

==Free will versus determinism==
{{See also|Free will|Determinism}}
For Leibniz, an additional central concern is the matter of reconciling human freedom (indeed, God's own freedom) with the [[determinism]] inherent in his own theory of the universe. Leibniz' solution casts God as a kind of "optimizer" of the collection of all original possibilities: Since he is good and omnipotent, and since he chose this world out of all possibilities, this world must be good—in fact, this world is the best of ''all'' [[possible worlds]].

In his writing, "Discourse on Metaphysics", Leibniz first establishes that God is an absolutely perfect being. He says people can logically conclude this through reason since "the works must bear the imprint of the workman, because we can learn who he was just by inspecting them".&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm. Discourse on Metaphysics. Trans. Jonathan F. Bennett. 2004. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He calls this the Principle of Perfection, which says that God's knowledge and power is to the highest degree, more so than any human can comprehend. Due to God's omnipotence, Leibniz makes the premise that God has thought of every single possibility there is to be thought of before creating this world. His perfection gives him the ability to think "beyond the power of a finite mind", so he has sufficient reason to choose one world over the other.&lt;ref name="Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm 2004"&gt;Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm. Discourse on Metaphysics. Trans. Jonathan F. Bennett. 2004. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of all the possibilities, God chose the very best world because not only is God powerful, but he is also morally good. He writes "the happiness of minds is God's principal aim, which He carries out as far as the general harmony will permit", meaning a benevolent God will only do actions with the intention of good will towards his creation.&lt;ref name="Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm 2004"/&gt; If one supposed that this world is not the best, then it assumes that the creator of the universe is not knowledgeable enough, powerful enough, or inherently good, for an inherently good God would have created the best world to the best of his ability. It would overall be a contradiction to his good and perfect nature, and so the universe that God has chosen to create can only be the best of all possible worlds.&lt;ref name="Look"&gt;Look, Brandon C. "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz." Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Stanford University, 22 Dec. 2007. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the one hand, this view might help us rationalize some of what we experience: Imagine that all the world is made of good and evil. The best possible world would have the most good and the least evil. Courage is better than no courage. It might be observed, then, that without evil to challenge us, there can be no courage. Since evil brings out the best aspects of humanity, evil is regarded as necessary. So in creating this world God made some evil to make the best of all possible worlds. On the other hand, the theory explains evil not by denying it or even rationalizing it—but simply by declaring it to be part of the optimum combination of elements that comprise the best possible godly choice. Leibniz thus does not claim that the world is overall very good, but that because of the necessary interconnections of goods and evils, God, though omnipotent, could not improve it in one way without making it worse in some other way.&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, [http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/think.pdf Leibniz's solution to the problem of evil], ''Think'' 5 (2003), 97-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giovanni Gentile]], in his work ''The General Theory of Mind as Pure Act'', claimed that if God had created everything to fall into line with the most favorable possible condition, it would suppose that all of reality is pre-realized and determined in the mind of God. Therefore, the apparent free will displayed by both God, by his necessity of being bound by what is the most good, and humanity in their limitations derived from God to be in line with the most good, are not free wills at all but entirely determinate. Thus ultimately relegated to blind naturalistic processes entrapping both God and humanity to necessity, robbing both of any true freely creative will.

==Criticism==
Critics of Leibniz, such as [[Voltaire]], argue that the world contains an amount of suffering too great to justify optimism. While Leibniz argued that suffering is good because it incites human will, critics argue that the degree of suffering is too severe to justify belief that God has created the "best of all possible worlds". Leibniz also addresses this concern by considering what God desires to occur (his antecedent will) and what God allows to occur (his consequent will).&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Peter Remnant, Jonathan Francis Bennett (1996). New Essays on Human Understanding. Cambridge University Press. pp. 182-190 {{ISBN|0-521-57660-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-57660-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as the Christian philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]], criticized Leibniz's theodicy by arguing that there probably is not such a thing as ''the best'' of all possible worlds, since one can always conceive a better world, such as a world with one more morally righteous person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Plantinga explained this point in an interview for [[Closer to Truth]], with Lawrence Krauss|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p692Kp-BcRQ|title=Best of all possible worlds|accessdate=2011-03-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730233032/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p692Kp-BcRQ|archivedate=2013-07-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Theodicy'' was deemed illogical by the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand. A Critical Exposition of the Philosophy of Leibniz. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin (1900).&lt;/ref&gt; Russell argues that moral and physical evil must result from metaphysical evil (imperfection). But imperfection is merely finitude or limitation; if existence is good, as Leibniz maintains, then the mere existence of evil requires that evil also be good. In addition, [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian]] Christian theology defines sin as not necessary but contingent, the result of free will. Russell maintains that Leibniz failed to logically show that metaphysical necessity (divine will) and human free will are not incompatible or contradictory.

The mathematician [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]], in his "Leibnizian Thoughts in Modern Science", wrote that Leibniz thought of God as a [[mathematician]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As is well known, the theory of the [[maxima and minima]] of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] was indebted to him for the greatest progress through the discovery of the method of [[tangent]]s. Well, he conceives God in the creation of the world like a mathematician who is solving a minimum problem, or rather, in our modern phraseology, a problem in the [[calculus of variations]]{{spaced ndash}}the question being to determine among an infinite number of possible worlds, that for which the sum of necessary evil is a minimum.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The statement that "we live in the best of all possible worlds" drew scorn, most notably from [[Voltaire]], who lampooned it in his comic novella ''[[Candide]]'' by having the character Dr. Pangloss (a parody of Leibniz and [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertuis]]) repeat it like a [[mantra]]. From this, the adjective "[[wikt:Panglossian|Panglossian]]" describes a person who believes that the world about us is the best possible one.

While Leibniz does state this universe is the best possible version of itself, the standard for goodness does not seem clear to many of his critics. To Leibniz, the best universe means a world that is “the simplest in hypotheses and the richest in phenomena”,&lt;ref name="Look" /&gt; in addition to the “happiness of minds” being God's main goal.&lt;ref name="Look" /&gt; Voltaire, Bertrand Russell, and other critics seem to equate goodness of the universe to no evil or evil acts whatsoever, presuming that a universe that did not contain evil would be "better" and that God could have created such a universe, but chose not to. According to Leibniz, that is not the case. He believes that if a better alternative existed “God would have brought it into actuality”.&lt;ref name="Look" /&gt; Essentially, Leibniz affirms that no human can truly think up of a better universe because they lack a holistic understanding of the universe, and God, who has that holistic understanding, has already chosen the best option. All of this shifts the meaning of goodness from morality and actions to the quality and phenomena of this universe's existence. Despite that, the concept of the goodness of the universe is still a point of major contention in Leibniz's argument, as someone could always argue about the lack of goodness in the universe based on those parameters

While not directly criticizing Leibniz, [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] holds a drastically different view on creation and the universe. Spinoza believes “that everything that God thinks or conceives must also exist”,&lt;ref name=Phemister&gt;Phemister, P. (2006). The rationalists: Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and he combines God's will and God's understanding where Leibniz separates them. In other words, God cannot imagine an infinite number of worlds and “as a separate act of will” choose one of those to create.&lt;ref name="Phemister" /&gt; How does Spinoza explain creation then? To put it simply, everything in the universe “is a direct result of God’s nature”.&lt;ref name="Phemister" /&gt; The moment God thinks of something, it exists. As there are not an infinite amount of universes (according to Spinoza and Leibniz) God must have only conceived of one universe. This, however, still runs into the problem of the existence of evil. How can God, in his perfection, create a world capable of evil if the world is an extension of his mind? In any case, Spinoza still tries to justify a non-infinite basis for the universe, where reality is everything God has ever thought of.

==Other philosophers==
[[Aquinas]], using [[Scholasticism]], treats the "Best of all possible worlds" problem in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' (1273):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The existence of God (Prima Pars, Q. 2)|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Objection 1:''' It seems that God does not exist; because if one of two contraries be infinite, the other would be altogether destroyed. But the word "God" means that He is infinite goodness. If, therefore, God existed, there would be no evil discoverable; but there is evil in the world. Therefore God does not exist.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He counters this in general by the ''[[quinque viae]]'', and in particular with this refutation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Reply to Objection 1:''' As [[Augustine]] says (Enchiridion xi): "Since God is the highest good, He would not allow any evil to exist in His works, unless His omnipotence and goodness were such as to bring good even out of evil." This is part of the infinite goodness of God, that He should allow evil to exist, and out of it produce good.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theological theory of [[pandeism]] has been classed as a logical derivation of this proposition with the contention that:

{{quote|If divine becoming were complete, God's ''[[kenosis]]''--God's self-emptying for the sake of love--would be total. In this ''pandeistic'' view, nothing of God would remain separate and apart from what God would become. Any separate divine existence would be inconsistent with God's unreserved participation in the lives and fortunes of the actualized phenomena."&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lane | first = William C. | date = January 2010 |title = Leibniz's Best World Claim Restructured | url = http://apq.press.illinois.edu/47/1/lane.html | journal = American Philosophical Journal | publisher = | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–84 | doi = | accessdate = 9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}}}}

'''Biological bet hedging''' occurs when organisms suffer decreased fitness in their typical conditions in exchange for increased fitness in stressful conditions. Biological bet hedging was originally proposed to explain the observation of a [[Soil seed bank|seed bank]], or a reservoir of ungerminated seeds in the soil.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Dan|date=1966-09-01|title=Optimizing reproduction in a randomly varying environment|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022519366901883|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=12|issue=1|pages=119–129|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(66)90188-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an [[Annual plant|annual plant's]] [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] is maximized for that year if all of its seeds germinate. However, if a drought occurs that kills germinated plants, but not ungerminated seeds, plants with seeds remaining in the seed bank will have a fitness advantage. Therefore, it can be advantageous for plants to "hedge their bets" in case of a drought by producing some seeds that germinate immediately and other seeds that lie dormant.

== Overview ==

=== Categories ===
There are three categories (strategies) of bet-hedging: "conservative" bet-hedging, "diversified" bet-hedging, and "adaptive coin flipping."

====Conservative bet hedging====
In conservative bet hedging, individuals lower their expected fitness in exchange for a lower variance in fitness.  The idea of this strategy is for an organism to "always play it safe" by using the same successful low-risk strategy regardless of environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="strategies"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olofsson|first1=H.|last2=Ripa|first2=J.|last3=Jonzen|first3=N.|title=Bet-hedging as an evolutionary game: the trade-off between egg size and number|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=27 May 2009|volume=276|issue=1669|pages=2963–2969|doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.0500|pmc=2817213}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this would be an organism producing [[Clutch (eggs)|clutches]] with a constant egg size that may not be optimal for any environmental condition, but result in the lowest overall variance.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;

====Diversified bet hedging====
In contrast to conservative bet hedging, diversified bet hedging occurs when individuals lower their expected fitness in a given year while also increasing the variance of survival between offspring.  This strategy uses the idea of not "putting all of your eggs in a basket."&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt; Individuals implementing this strategy actually invest in several different strategies at once, resulting in low variation in long-term success.  This could be demonstrated by a clutch of eggs of different sizes, each optimal for one potential environment of the offspring.  While this means that offspring specialized for another environment are less likely to survive to adulthood, it also protects against the possibility of no offspring surviving to the next year.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;

====Adaptive coin flipping====
An individual using this type of bet hedging chooses what strategy to use based on a prediction of what the environment will be like. Organisms using this form of bet hedging make these predictions and select strategies annually.  For example, an organism may produce clutches of different egg sizes from year to year, increasing variation in offspring success between clutches.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;  Unlike conservative and diversified bet hedging strategies, adaptive coin flipping isn't concerned with minimizing the variation in fitness between years.

== Evolution ==
To determine if a bet hedging allele is favored, the long-term fitness of each allele must be compared.  Particularly in highly variable environments where bet hedging is likely to evolve, long-term fitness is best measured using the [[geometric mean]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dempster|first=Everett R.|date=1955-01-01|title=MAINTENANCE OF GENETIC HETEROGENEITY|url=http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/20/25|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology|language=en|volume=20|pages=25–32|doi=10.1101/SQB.1955.020.01.005|issn=0091-7451|pmid=13433552}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is multiplicative instead of additive like the [[arithmetic mean]].  The geometric mean is highly sensitive to small values.  Even rare occurrences of zero fitness for a [[genotype]] result in it having an expected geometric mean of zero. This makes it appropriate for circumstances where a single genotype may have variable fitness depending on environmental circumstances.

Bet hedging is understood to be a mode of response to environmental change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simons|first=Andrew M.|date=2011-06-07|title=Modes of response to environmental change and the elusive empirical evidence for bet hedging|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences|volume=278|issue=1712|pages=1601–1609|doi=10.1098/rspb.2011.0176|issn=1471-2954|pmc=3081777|pmid=21411456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptations that allow organisms to survive in fluctuating environmental conditions provide an evolutionary advantage.  While a bet hedging trait may not be optimal for any one environment, this is outweighed by the benefits of higher fitness across a variety of environments.  Therefore, bet hedging [[allele]]s tend to be favored in more variable environments.  In order for a bet hedging allele to spread, it must persist in the typical environment through [[genetic drift]] long enough for the alternative environment, in which the bet hedger has an advantage, to occur. At that point, selection may [[Selective sweep|sweep]] the allele to fixation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Oliver D.|last2=Masel|first2=Joanna|date=2007-12-01|title=The evolution of bet-hedging adaptations to rare scenarios|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580907000925|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|volume=72|issue=4|pages=560–575|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2007.08.006|pmc=2118055|pmid=17915273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common example used when describing bet hedging is comparing the arithmetic and geometric fitness between specialist and bet hedging genotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Philippi|first=Tom|last2=Seger|first2=Jon|title=Hedging one's evolutionary bets, revisited|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0169534789901389|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=41–44|doi=10.1016/0169-5347(89)90138-9|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford surveys in evolutionary biology|last=Seger|first=Jon|last2=Brockmann|first2=H.

The good year specialist has the highest fitness during a good year but does very poorly during a bad year, while the reverse is true for a bad year specialist. The conservative bet hedger does equally well in all years and the diversified bet hedger in this example uses the two specialist strategies each 50% of the time; they perform better than the conservative bet hedger in good years, but worse during a bad year.

In this example, fitness is approximately equal within the specialist and bet hedger strategies, with the bet hedgers having a significantly higher fitness than the specialists. While the good year specialist' has the highest arithmetic mean, the bet hedging strategies are still preferred due to their higher geometric mean.

It is also important to realize that the fitness of any strategy is dependent on a large number of factors, such as the ratio of good to bad years and its relative fitness between good and bad years. Small changes in the strategies or environment having a large impact on which is optimal.  In the above example, the diversified bet hedger outweighs the conservative bet hedger if it uses the good year specialist strategy more often. In contrast, if the relative fitness of the good year specialist was 0.35 in a bad year, it becomes the optimal strategy.

=== Prokarya ===
Experiments in bet hedging using prokaryotic model organisms provide some of the most simplified views of the evolution of bet hedging. As bet hedging involves a stochastic switching between [[phenotype]]s across generations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beaumont | first1 = H. J. E. | last2 = Kost | first2 = C. | last3 = Rainey | first3 = P. B. | last4 = Gallie | first4 = J. | last5 = Ferguson | first5 = G. C. | year = 2009 | title = Experimental evolution of bet hedging | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 462 | issue = 7269| pages = 90–93 | doi = 10.1038/nature08504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[prokaryote]]s are able to display this phenomenon quite nicely due to their ability to reproduce quickly enough to track evolution in a single population over a short period of time. This rapid rate of reproduction has allowed for the study of bet hedging in labs through experimental evolution models. These models have been used to deduce the evolutionary origins of bet hedging.

Within prokarya, there are a multitude of bet hedging examples. In one example, the bacterium ''[[Sinorhizobium meliloti]]'' stores carbon and energy in a compound known as poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) in order to withstand carbon-deficient environments. When starved, ''S. meliloti'' populations begin to display bet hedging by forming two non-identical [[Cell division|daughter cells]] during [[Fission (biology)|binary fission]]. The daughter cells display either low PHB levels or high PHB levels, which are better suited to short and long-term starvation, respectively. It has been reported that the low-PHB must compete effectively for resources in order to survive, whereas the high-PHB cells can survive for over a year without food. In this example, the PHB phenotype is being ‘bet-hedged’, as the survivability of the offspring largely depends on their environment, where only one phenotype is likely to survive under specific conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ratcliff | first1 = W. C. | last2 = Denison | first2 = R. F. | year = 2010 | title = Individual-level bet hedging in the bacterium sinorhizobium meliloti | url = | journal = Current Biology | volume = 20 | issue = 19| pages = 1740–1744 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2010.08.036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of bet hedging arises in ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''. In a given population of this bacteria, persister cells exist with the ability to arrest their growth, which leaves them unaffected by dramatic changes to the environment. Once the persister cells grow to form another population of its species, which may or may not be [[Antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistant]], they will produce both cells with normal cell growth and another population of persisters to continue this cycle as the case may be. The ability to switch between the persister and normal phenotype is a form of bet-hedging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Veening | first1 = J. | last2 = Smits | first2 = W. K. | last3 = Kuipers | first3 = O. P. | year = 2008 | title = Bistability, epigenetics, and bet-hedging in bacteria | url = | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 62 | issue = 1| pages = 193–210 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.62.081307.163002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prokaryotic persistence as a method of bet hedging is thus of importance to the field of medicine due to bacterial persistence. Because bet hedging is designed to produce genetically diverse offspring randomly in order to survive catastrophe, it is difficult to develop treatments for bacterial infections, as bet hedging may ensure the survival of its species within its host, heedless to the antibiotic.

=== Eukarya ===
Eukaryotic bet hedging models, unlike prokaryotic models, tend to be used to study more complex evolutionary proceces. In the context of eukaryotes, bet hedging is best used as a way to analyze complex environmental influences  affecting the selective pressures underlying the principle  of bet hedging. However, because Eukarya is a broad category, this section has been subdivided into kingdoms [[Animal]]ia, [[Plant]]ae, and [[Fungus|Fungi]].

==== Vertebrates ====
In example, West [[Atlantic salmon]] ([[Atlantic salmon|''Salmo salar'']]) have been hypothesized to have [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC)-dependent mating systems, which have been shown in other species to be important for determining disease resistance among offspring. Namely, there is evidence that selection for increased MHC diversity is a strong influence on mate choice, where it is thought that individuals are more likely to mate with individuals whose MHC is less similar to their own in order to produce variable offspring. In accordance with the bet hedging model, it has been found that the reproductive success of mating pairs of Atlantic salmon is environmentally dependent, where certain MHC constructs are only advantageous under specific environmental circumstances. Thus, this supports the evidence that MHC diversity is crucial for the long-term reproductive success of the parents, as the tradeoff for an initial decrease in short-term reproductive fitness is mediated by the survival of a few of their offspring in a variable environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Evans | first1 = M. L. | last2 = Dionne | first2 = M. | last3 = Miller | first3 = K. M. | last4 = Bernatchez | first4 = L. | year = 2012 | title = Mate choice for major histocompatibility complex genetic divergence as a bet-hedging strategy in the atlantic salmon (salmo salar) | url = | journal = Proceedings: Biological Sciences | volume = 279 | issue = | pages = 379–386 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2011.0909 | pmc = 3223684 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second example among vertebrates is the marsupial species [[Stripe-faced dunnart|''Sminthopsis macrour'']], which use a [[torpor]] strategy in order to reduce their metabolic rate to survive environmental changes. Reproductive [[hormone]] cycles have been shown to mediate the timing of torpor and reproduction, and in mice have been shown to mediate this process entirely, heedless to the environment. In the marsupial species, however, an adaptive coin flipping mechanism is employed where neither torpor nor reproduction are affected by manipulation of hormones, suggesting that this [[marsupial]] species makes a more active decision about when to use torpor that is better-suited to the uncertain environment in which it lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McAllan | first1 = B. M. | last2 = Feay | first2 = N. | last3 = Bradley | first3 = A.

==== Invertebrates ====
Many invertebrate species are known to exhibit various forms of bet hedging. ''Diaptomus sanguineus,'' an aquatic crustacean species found in many ponds of the Northeast United States, is one of the most well-studied examples of bet hedging. This species uses a form of diversified bet hedging called germ banking, in which emergence timing among offspring from a single clutch is highly variable. This reduces the potential costs of a catastrophic event during a particularly vulnerable time in offspring development. In ''Diaptomus sanguineus'', germ banking occurs when parents produce dormant eggs prior to annual environmental shifts that yield increased risk for developing offspring. For example, in temporary ponds, ''Diaptomus sanguineus'' production of dormant eggs peaks just before the annual dry season in June when ponds levels decrease. In permanent ponds, dormant egg production increases in March, just before an annual increase in feeding activity of sunfish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Margaret E K|last2=Dennehy|first2=John J|date=2005-12-01|title=Germ Banking: Bet‐Hedging and Variable Release from Egg and Seed Dormancy|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/498282|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=80|issue=4|pages=431–451|doi=10.1086/498282|issn=0033-5770}}&lt;/ref&gt; This example demonstrates that germ banking may take different forms within a species depending on the environmental risk presented. Bet hedging through variable egg hatching patterns are seen in other crustaceans as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radzikowski|first=J.|date=2013-07-01|title=Resistance of dormant stages of planktonic invertebrates to adverse environmental conditions|url=https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/35/4/707/1528340/Resistance-of-dormant-stages-of-planktonic|journal=Journal of Plankton Research|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=707–723|doi=10.1093/plankt/fbt032|issn=0142-7873}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hakalahti|first=Teija|last2=Häkkinen|first2=Heli|last3=Valtonen|first3=E.

Invertebrate bet-hedging has also been observed in the mating systems of some species of spider. Female sierra dome spiders (''Linyphia litigiosa)'' are polyandrous, mating with secondary males in order to compensate for uncertainty regarding the quality of the primary mate. Primary male mates are considered to be of higher fitness than secondary males, as primary mates must overcome intrasexual fighting prior to mating with a female, while secondary male mates are chosen through female choice. Scientists believe multiple paternity has evolved in response to virgin insemination by low quality secondary male mates who have not undergone selection through intrasexual fighting. Females have developed a mechanism for sperm precedence to retain control over offspring paternity and increase offspring fitness. Further examination of female genitalia has supported this hypothesis. The sierra dome spider exhibits this behavior as a form of genetic bet hedging, reducing the risk of producing low quality offspring and contracting venereal disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Paul J.|date=1991-02-01|title=Multiple paternity as genetic bet-hedging in female sierra dome spiders, Linyphia litigiosa (Linyphiidae)|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347205804865|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=41|issue=2|pages=343–360|doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80486-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of bet hedging is notably different than most other forms of bet hedging, as it has not arisen in response to environmental conditions, but rather it has arisen as a result of the species mating system.

===== Fungi =====

Bet hedging is employed in fungi similarly to bacteria, but in fungi, it is more complex. This phenomenon is beneficial to fungi, but in some cases, it has harmful effects on humans, illustrating that bet hedging has clinical importance. One study suggests that bet hedging may even contribute to the failure of chemotherapy in cancer due to mechanisms similar to that of bet hedging used in fungi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meadows|first1=Robin|title=Yeast Survive by Hedging Their Bets|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001327|website=PLOS Biology|pages=e1001327|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001327|date=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way fungi use bet hedging is by displaying different colony morphologies when grown on agar plates.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levy|first1=Sasha F.|last2=Ziv|first2=Naomi|last3=Siegal|first3=Mark L.|title=Bet Hedging in Yeast by Heterogeneous, Age-Correlated Expression of a Stress Protectant|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001325|website=PLOS Biology|pages=e1001325|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001325|date=8 May 2012|volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This variation allows for colonies with different morphologies, including resistances that allow them to survive, to thrive and reproduce in different conditions or environments. As a result, fungal infections may be more difficult to treat if bet hedging is involved. For example, pathogenic strains of yeast like ''[[Candida albicans]]'' or ''[[Candida glabrata]]'' using this strategy will resist treatments. These fungi are known to cause an infection known as [[candidiasis]].

While bet hedging in fungi is important, not much is known about the mechanisms for the different strategies employed by different species. Researchers have studied ''[[S. cerevisiae]]'' to determine the mechanism of bet hedging in this species.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It was determined that in ''S. cerevisiae'', variation exists in the distribution of growth rates among yeast micro-colonies and that slow growth is a predictor of resistance to heat. Tsl1 is one gene that was determined as a factor in this resistance. The abundance of this gene was shown to correlate with heat and stress resistance, and thus survival of the yeast micro-colonies under harsh conditions by using bet hedging. This illustrates that by using bet hedging, pathogenic strains of this yeast that are harmful to humans are more difficult to treat.

A group of researchers studied another way bet hedging is used by looking at the ascomycete fungus ''[[Neurospora crassa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graham|first1=Jeffrey K.|last2=Smith|first2=Myron L.|last3=Simons|first3=Andrew M.|title=Experimental evolution of bet hedging under manipulated environmental uncertainty in Neurospora crassa|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1787/20140706|website=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|pages=20140706|language=en|doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.0706|date=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was observed that this species produces [[ascospores]] with variation in their dormancy because non-dormant ascospores can be killed by heat, but dormant ascospores will survive. The only con is that it will take longer for the dormant ascopores to be germinated.

==== Plantae ====
Plants provide simple examples for studying bet hedging in wildlife, allowing for field studies but without as many confounding factors as animals.  Studying closely related plant species can help us understand more about the circumstances under which bet hedging evolves.

The classic example of bet hedging, delayed seed germination,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; has been extensively studied in desert annuals.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clauss|first=M.

They also found a large range of germination dates and flexibility in germination for drier populations when exposed to rain, a phenomenon known as [[phenotypic plasticity]]. Other studies of desert annuals&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; have also found a relationship between temporal variation and lower germination rates. One of these  studies&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; also found the density of seeds in the seed bank to affect germination rates.

Bet hedging through a seed bank has also been implicated in the persistence of weeds. One study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=H. A.|last2=Feast|first2=Patricia M.|date=1972-12-01|title=Fate of Seeds of Some Annual Weeds in Different Depths of Cultivated and Undisturbed Soil|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3180.1972.tb01226.x/abstract|journal=Weed Research|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=316–324|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3180.1972.tb01226.x|issn=1365-3180}}&lt;/ref&gt; of twenty weed species showed that the percentage of viable seeds after 5 years increased with soil depth, and germination rates decreased with soil depth (although specific numbers varied between species). This indicates that weeds will engage in bet hedging at higher rates in circumstances where the costs of bet hedging are lower.

Collectively, these findings do provide evidence for bet hedging in plants, but also show the importance of competition and phenotypic plasticity that simple bet hedging models often ignore.

=== Archaea ===
Thus far, research on bet hedging involving species in the domain [[Archaea]] hasn't been easily accessible.

In [[network science]], a '''biased random walk on a graph''' is a time path process in which an evolving variable jumps from its current state to one of various potential new states; unlike in a pure [[random walk]], the probabilities of the potential new states are unequal.

Biased random walks on a graph provide an approach for the [https://www.springer.com/birkhauser/mathematics/book/978-0-8176-4788-9 structural analysis] of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)#Undirected graph|undirected graphs]] in order to extract their symmetries when the network is too complex or when it is not large enough to be analyzed by [[Statistics|statistical methods]]. The concept of biased random walks on a graph has attracted the attention of many researchers and data companies over the past decade especially in the transportation and [[social network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Roberta Sinatra, Jesús Gómez-Gardeñes, Renaud Lambiotte, Vincenzo Nicosia, and Vito Latora|title=Maximal-entropy random walks in complex networks with limited information|journal=Physical Review E|date=March 2011|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevE.83.030103 |pmid=21517435|volume=83|issue=3|pages=030103|arxiv=1007.4936|bibcode=2011PhRvE..83c0103S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model ==
There have been written many different representations of the biased random walks on [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s based on the particular purpose of the analysis. A common representation of the mechanism for [[Graph (discrete mathematics)#Undirected graph|undirected graphs]] is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=J. Gómez-Gardeñes |author2=V. Latora|title=Entropy rate of diffusion processes on complex networks|journal=Physical Review E|date=Dec 2008 |doi= 10.1103/PhysRevE.78.065102 |pmid=19256892|volume=78|issue=6|pages=065102| arxiv=0712.0278| bibcode=2008PhRvE..78f5102G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On an [[Graph (discrete mathematics)#Undirected graph|undirected graph]], a walker takes a step from the current node, &lt;math&gt;j,&lt;/math&gt; to node &lt;math&gt;i.&lt;/math&gt; Assuming that each node has an attribute &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i,&lt;/math&gt; the probability of jumping from node &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;T_{ij}^\alpha=\frac{\alpha_i A_{ij}}{\sum_{k} \alpha_k A_{kj}},&lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;A_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; represents the topological weight of the edge going from &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;i.&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, the steps of the walker are biased by the factor of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; which may differ from one node to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| authors=R. Lambiotte, R. Sinatra, J.-C. Delvenne, T.S. Evans, M. Barahona, V. Latora|title=Flow graphs: interweaving dynamics and structure| journal = Physical Review E|date=Dec 2010|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.84.017102|pmid=21867345|volume=84|issue=1|pages=017102|arxiv=1012.1211|bibcode=2011PhRvE..84a7102L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the network, the attribute &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted differently. It might be implied as the attraction of a person in a [[social network]], it might be [[betweenness centrality]] or even it might be explained as an intrinsic characteristic of a node. In case of a [http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/markov/WalkGraph.html fair random walk on graph] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is one for all the nodes.

In case of shortest paths random walks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Blanchard, Volchenkov, D|title=Mathematical Analysis of Urban Spatial Networks| date=2008|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-87829-2| url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233971652| journal=Understanding Complex Systems|isbn=978-3-540-87828-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes that pass through the node &lt;math&gt;i &lt;/math&gt;. In fact the walker prefers the nodes with higher [[betweenness centrality]] which is defined as below:

:&lt;math&gt;C(i)=\tfrac{\text{Total number of shortest paths through } i}{\text{Total number of shortest paths}}&lt;/math&gt;

Based on the above equation, the recurrence time to a node in the biased walk is given by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Volchenkov D |author2=Blanchard P|title=Fair and biased random walks on undirected graphs and related entropies|date=2011|publisher=Birkhäuser|page=380|url=http://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/publication/1997352|isbn=9780817649036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''brahmavihāras''' (sublime attitudes, lit. "abodes of brahma") are a series of four [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] virtues and the meditation practices made to cultivate them. They are also known as the '''four immeasurables''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''apramāṇa'', [[Pali|Pāli]]: ''appamaññā'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhistethics.org/9/wetle021.html Jon Wetlesen, Did Santideva Destroy the Bodhisattva Path? ''Jnl Buddhist Ethics'', Vol. 9, 2002] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228201738/http://www.buddhistethics.org/9/wetle021.html# |date=2007-02-28 }} (accessed March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi, Bhikkhu. ''Abhidhammattha Sangaha: A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma''. BPS Pariyatti Editions, 2000, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Brahma-viharas'' are: 
# [[metta|loving-kindness or benevolence]] (metta)
# [[Karuṇā|compassion]] (karuna)
# [[Mudita|empathetic joy]] (mudita)
# [[Upekkha|equanimity]] (upekkha)

According to the ''[[Metta Sutta]]'', cultivation of the four immeasurables has the power to cause the practitioner to be reborn into a "[[Brahmā (Buddhism)|Brahmā]] realm" (Pāli: ''Brahmaloka'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.125.than.html AN 4.125, ''Metta Sutta'']. See note 2 on the different kinds of Brahmas mentioned.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Brahma-viharas'', along with meditative tradition associated with ''Brahma-vihara'', are also found in pre-Buddha and post-Buddha [[Vedic]] and [[Sramanism|Sramanic]] literature.

==Etymology and translations==
* Pāli: ''cattāri brahmavihārā''
* {{lang-sa|चत्वारि ब्रह्मविहाराः}} ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]: ''{{IAST|catvāri brahmavihārāḥ}}'')

''Brahmavihāra'' may be [[parsing|parsed]] as "Brahmā" and "[[vihara|vihāra]]"; which is often rendered into English as "sublime" or "divine abodes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.208.than.html Thanissaro Bhikkhu].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Apramāṇa'', usually translated as "the immeasurables," means "boundlessness, infinitude, a state that is illimitable".&lt;ref name=PaliDic&gt;[[Thomas William Rhys Davids|Rhys Davids]] &amp; Stede, 1921-25, ''Pali-English Dictionary'', [[Pali Text Society]].&lt;/ref&gt; When developed to a high degree in meditation, these attitudes are said to make the mind "immeasurable" and like the mind of the loving ''Brahmā'' (gods).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, "An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics." Cambridge University Press, 2000, page 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Brahma-vihara''==
The four ''Brahma-vihara'' are:

# [[Mudita|Empathetic joy]] (Pāli and Sanskrit: ''[[mudita|muditā]]''): is the feeling of joy because others are happy, even if one did not contribute to it, it is a form of sympathetic joy;&lt;ref name="Fowler1999p60"/&gt;
# [[Upekkha|Equanimity]] (Pāli: ''[[upekkhā]]'', Sanskrit: ''[[upekṣā]]''): is even-mindedness and serenity, treating everyone impartially.&lt;ref name="Fowler1999p60"&gt;{{cite book|author=Merv Fowler |title=Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7UKjtA0QDwC |year=1999|publisher=Sussex Academic Press |isbn=978-1-898723-66-0 |pages=60–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=peterharvey2012p154&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey |title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XAgAwAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-85126-8 |pages=154, 326 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Buddhism===
The ''Brahma-vihara'' are a pre-Buddhist concept, to which the Buddhist tradition gave its own interpretation.&lt;ref name="Aronson1980p71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google247"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey |title=Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oZCvAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA247|year=2001|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-4726-4 |page=247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Digha Nikaya]]'' asserts the Buddha to be calling the Brahmavihara as "that practice", and he then contrasts it with "my practice" as follows:&lt;ref name="Aronson1980p71"/&gt;
{{quote|...that practice [namely, the mere cultivation of love and so forth, according to the fourfold instructions] is conducive not to turning away, nor to dispassion, nor to quieting, nor to cessation, nor to direct knowledge, nor to enlightenment, nor to nirvana, but only to rebirth in the world of Brahma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...my practice is conducive to complete turning away, dispassion, cessation, quieting, direct knowledge, enlightenment, and nirvana – specifically the [[Noble Eightfold Path|eightfold noble path]] (...)
|The Buddha, Digha Nikaya II.251|Translated by Harvey B. Aronson&lt;ref name="Aronson1980p71"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harvey B. Aronson |title=Love and Sympathy in Theravāda Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYn7WsDccU0C&amp;pg=PA71 |year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1403-5 |page=71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Gombrich, the Buddhist usage of the ''brahma-vihāra'' originally referred to an awakened state of mind, and a concrete attitude toward other beings which was equal to "living with Brahman" here and now. The later tradition took those descriptions too literally, linking them to cosmology and understanding them as "living with Brahman" by rebirth in the Brahma-world.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=84-85}} According to Gombrich, "the Buddha taught that kindness - what Christians tend to call love - was a way to salvation.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=62}}

In the ''Tevijja Sutta'', [[Buddhism and Hinduism#Vedas|The Threefold Knowledge]] of the ''Digha Nikaya'' set of scriptures, Buddha Shākyamuni is asked the way to fellowship/companionship/communion with Brahma. He replies that he personally knows the world of Brahma and the way to it, and explains the meditative method for reaching it by using an [[analogy]] of the resonance of the [[conch shell]] of the ''[[Ashtamangala|aṣṭamaṅgala]]'':
{{quote|A monk suffuses the world in the four directions with a mind of benevolence, then above, and below, and all around – the whole world from all sides, completely, with a benevolent, all-embracing, great, boundless, peaceful and friendly mind … Just as a powerful conch-blower makes himself heard with no great effort in all four [cardinal] directions, so too is there no limit to the unfolding of [this] heart-liberating benevolence. This is a way to communion with Brahma.&lt;ref&gt;''Majjhimanikaya'', tr. by Kurt Schmidt, Kristkeitz, Berlin, 1978, p.261, tr. by Tony Page.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Buddha then says that the monk must follow this up with an equal suffusion of the entire world with mental projections of compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity (regarding all beings with an eye of equality).

In the two ''Metta Suttas'' of the ''[[Anguttara Nikaya|Aṅguttara Nikāya]],''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.125.than.html AN 4.125], [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.126.than.html AN 4.126]&lt;/ref&gt; the Buddha states that those who practice radiating the four immeasurables in this life and die "without losing it" are destined for rebirth in a heavenly realm in their next life.  In addition, if such a person is a Buddhist disciple (Pāli: ''[[sravaka|sāvaka]]'') and thus realizes the [[Three marks of existence|three characteristics]] of the [[Skandha|five aggregates]], then after his heavenly life, this disciple will reach ''[[nirvana|nibbāna]]''.  Even if one is not a disciple, one will still attain the heavenly life, after which, however depending on what his past deeds may have been, one may be reborn in a hell realm, or as an animal or [[Preta|hungry ghost]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.125.nymo.html  AN 4.125: ''Metta Sutta: Loving-kindness'', Ñanamoli's translation] (accessed March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In another sutta in the Aṅguttara Nikāya, the laywoman Sāmāvatī is mentioned as an example of someone who excels at loving-kindness.{{sfn|Bodhi|2012|p=112}} In the Buddhist tradition she is often referred to as such, often citing an account that an arrow shot at her was warded off through her spiritual power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sāmāvatī|encyclopedia=Dictionary of Pāli Proper Names|date= |year=1938 |publisher=Pali Text Society |location=Wilts|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Visuddhimagga''===
The four immeasurables are explained in [[Visuddhimagga|''The Path of Purification'']] (''Visuddhimagga''), written in the fifth century CE by the scholar and commentator [[Buddhaghosa|Buddhaghoṣa]].  They are often practiced by taking each of the immeasurables in turn and applying it to oneself (a practice taught by many contemporary teachers and monastics that was established after the Pali Suttas were completed), and then to others nearby, and so on to everybody in the world, and to everybody in all universes.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

===''A Cavern of Treasures'' (''mDzod-phug'')===
''A Cavern of Treasures'' ({{bo|t=མཛོད་ཕུག|w=mdzod phug}}) is a Bonpo ''[[terma (Buddhism)|terma]]'' uncovered by Shenchen Luga ({{bo|t=གཤེན་ཆེན་ཀླུ་དགའ|w=gshen-chen klu-dga'}}) in the early eleventh century. A segment of it enshrines a Bonpo evocation of the four immeasurables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/abhidharma-tenet-systems/comparison-of-buddhist-traditions/the-four-immeasurables-in-hinayana-mahayana-and-bon Berzin, Alexander (2005).

==Origins==
Prior to the advent of the Buddha, according to Martin Wiltshire, the pre-Buddhist traditions of ''Brahma-loka'', meditation and these four virtues are evidenced in both early Buddhist and non-Buddhist literature.&lt;ref name="Wiltshire1990p255"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin G. Wiltshire |title=Ascetic Figures Before and in Early Buddhism: The Emergence of Gautama as the Buddha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WXmmkYQf4RwC&amp;pg=PA248 |year=1990|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-009896-9 |pages=248–264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early Buddhist texts assert that pre-Buddha ancient Indian sages who taught these virtues were earlier incarnations of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Wiltshire1990p255"/&gt; Post-Buddha, these same virtues are found in the Hindu texts such as verse 1.33 of the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sutras of Patañjali]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Quote: '''मैत्री करुणा मुदितोपेक्षाणां''' सुखदुःखपुण्यापुण्यविषयाणां भावनातश्चित्तप्रसादनम् ॥ ३३॥ - Yogasutra 1.33; [http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_yoga/yogasuutra.html?lang=sa Source], SanskritDocuments.Org&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the four immeasurables, namely Maitri, Karuna and Upeksha, are found in the early Upanishads of Hinduism, while all four are found with slight variations – such as ''pramoda'' instead of ''mudita'' –  in Jainism literature, states Wiltshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin G. Wiltshire |title=Ascetic Figures Before and in Early Buddhism: The Emergence of Gautama as the Buddha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WXmmkYQf4RwC&amp;pg=PA248 |year=1990|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-009896-9 |pages=241–242 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Indian ''Paccekabuddhas'' mentioned in the early Buddhist [[Sutra|Suttas]], those who lived before the Buddha, mention all "four immeasurables" and Brahmavihara, and they are claimed in the Suttas to be previous incarnations of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Wiltshire1990p255"/&gt;

According to Peter Harvey, the Buddhist scriptures acknowledge that the four ''Brahmavihara'' meditation practices "did not originate within the Buddhist tradition".&lt;ref name="google247"/&gt; The Buddha never claimed that the "four immeasurables" were his unique ideas, in a manner similar to "cessation, quieting, nirvana".&lt;ref name="Aronson1980p71"/&gt;

The pre-Buddha [[Chandogya Upanishad]], states Jayatilleke, in section 8.15 teaches metta and ahimsa to all creatures claiming that this practice leads to ''Brahmaloka''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K N Jayatilleke |title=Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pBTAQAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-54287-1|pages=477–479 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift in Vedic ideas, from rituals to virtues, is particularly discernible in the early Upanishadic thought, and it is unclear as to what extent and how early Upanishadic traditions of Hinduism and Sramanic traditions such as Buddhism and Jainism influenced each other, on ideas such as "four immeasurables", meditation and Brahmavihara.&lt;ref name="Wiltshire1990p255"/&gt;

In an authoritative Jain scripture, the [[Tattvartha Sutra]] (Chapter 7, sutra 11), there is a mention of four right sentiments: Maitri, pramoda, karunya, madhyastha:
{{quote|Benevolence towards all living beings, joy at the sight of the virtuous, compassion and sympathy for the afflicted, and tolerance towards the insolent and ill-behaved.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14487">In [[psychology]], the human mind is considered to be a '''cognitive miser''' due to the tendency of people to think and [[problem solving|solve problems]] in simpler and less effortful ways rather than in more sophisticated and more effortful ways, regardless of intelligence.&lt;ref name="Stanovich2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stanovich |first=Keith E. |authorlink=Keith Stanovich |date=2009 |chapter=The cognitive miser: ways to avoid thinking |title=What intelligence tests miss: the psychology of rational thought |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2SQvleDwn9YC&amp;pg=PA70 70–85] |isbn=9780300123852 |oclc=216936066 |ref=harv}} See also other chapters in the same book: "Framing and the cognitive miser" (chapter 7); "A different pitfall of the cognitive miser: thinking a lot, but losing" (chapter 9).&lt;/ref&gt; Just as a [[miser]] seeks to avoid spending money, the human mind often seeks to avoid spending computational effort. The cognitive miser theory is an umbrella theory of [[cognition]] that brings together previous research on [[heuristic]]s and [[attributional bias]]es to explain how and why people are cognitive misers.&lt;ref name="Fiske&amp;Taylor1991"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fiske |first1=Susan T. |authorlink1=Susan Fiske |last2=Taylor |first2=Shelley E. |authorlink2=Shelley Taylor |year=1991 |origyear=1984 |title=Social cognition |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=0070211914 |oclc=22810253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ToplakWestStanovich2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Toplak |first1=Maggie E. |last2=West |first2=Richard F. |last3=Stanovich |first3=Keith E. |authorlink3=Keith Stanovich |date=April 2014 |title=Assessing miserly information processing: an expansion of the Cognitive Reflection Test |journal=Thinking &amp; Reasoning |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=147–168 |doi=10.1080/13546783.2013.844729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''cognitive miser'' was first introduced by [[Susan Fiske]] and [[Shelley Taylor]] in 1984. It is an important concept in [[social cognition]] theory and has been influential in other social sciences including but not exclusive to economics and political science.&lt;ref name="Fiske&amp;Taylor1991"/&gt;

==Background==

===The naïve scientist and attribution theory===
Before Fiske and Taylor's cognitive miser theory, the predominant model of social cognition was the naïve scientist. First proposed in 1958 by [[Fritz Heider]] in ''The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations,'' this theory holds that humans think and act with dispassionate [[rationality]] whilst engaging in detailed and nuanced thought processes for both complex and routine actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heider |first=Fritz |authorlink=Fritz Heider |year=1958 |title=The psychology of interpersonal relations |edition=1st |location=New York |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=0898592828 |oclc=225326}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, humans were thought to think like scientists, albeit naïve ones, measuring and analyzing the world around them. Applying this framework to human thought processes, naïve scientists seek the consistency and stability that comes from a coherent view of the world and need for environmental control.&lt;ref name="CrispTurner2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crisp |first1=Richard J. |last2=Turner |first2=Rhiannon N. |year=2014 |title=Essential social psychology |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |isbn=9781446270769 |oclc=873005953}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2016}}

In order to meet these needs, naïve scientists make [[attribution (psychology)|attribution]]s.&lt;ref name="KassinFein&amp;Markus2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kassin |first1=Saul |authorlink1=Saul Kassin |last2=Fein |first2=Steven |authorlink2=Steven Fein |last3=Markus |first3=Hazel Rose |authorlink3=Hazel Rose Markus |date=2016 |title=Social psychology |edition=10th |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |isbn=9781305580220 |oclc=952391832}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2016}} Thus, attribution theory emerged from the study of the ways in which individuals assess causal relationships and mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Lee |authorlink=Lee Ross |year=1977 |chapter=The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: distortions in the attribution process |editor-first=Leonard |editor-last=Berkowitz |title=Advances in experimental social psychology |volume=10 |pages=173–220 |location=New York |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=012015210X |oclc=1283539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the study of causal attributions, led by [[Harold Kelley]] and [[Bernard Weiner]] amongst others, social psychologists began to observe that subjects regularly demonstrate several attributional biases including but not limited to the [[fundamental attribution error]].&lt;ref name="JonesHarris67"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=Edward E. |last2=Harris |first2=Victor A. |year=1967 |title=The attribution of attitudes |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]] |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1–24 |doi=10.1016/0022-1031(67)90034-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of attributions had two effects: it created further interest in testing the naive scientist and opened up a new wave of [[social psychology]] research that questioned its explanatory power. This second effect helped to lay the foundation for Fiske and Taylor's cognitive miser.&lt;ref name="CrispTurner2014"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2016}}

===Heuristics===
Much of the cognitive miser theory is built upon work done on [[heuristics in judgment and decision-making]],&lt;ref name=BaroneMadduxSnyder1997&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barone |first1=David F. |last2=Maddux |first2=James E. |last3=Snyder, Charles R. |authorlink3=Charles R.

==The cognitive miser theory==
The wave of research on attributional biases done by Kahneman, Tversky and others effectively ended the dominance of Heider's naïve scientist within social psychology.&lt;ref name="BaroneMadduxSnyder1997"/&gt; Fiske and Taylor, building upon the prevalence of heuristics in human cognition, offered their theory of the cognitive miser. It is, in many ways, a unifying theory which suggests that humans engage in economically prudent thought processes, instead of acting like scientists who rationally weigh costs and benefits, test hypothesis, and update expectations based upon the results of the experiments that are our everyday actions.&lt;ref name="Fiske&amp;Taylor1991"/&gt; In other words, humans are more inclined to act as cognitive misers using mental short cuts to make assessments and decisions, about issues and ideas about which they know very little as well as issues of great salience. Fiske and Taylor argue that acting as cognitive misers is rational due to the sheer volume and intensity of information and stimuli humans intake&lt;ref name="Fiske&amp;Taylor1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nano&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scheufele |first=Dietram A. |last2=Lewenstein |first2=Bruce V. |title=The public and nanotechnology: how citizens make sense of emerging technologies |journal=Journal of Nanoparticle Research |date=17 May 2005 |volume=7 |pages=659–667 [660] |doi=10.1007/s11051-005-7526-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other psychologists also argue that the cognitively miserly tendency of humans is a primary reason why "humans are often less than rational".&lt;ref name="ToplakWestStanovich2014"/&gt;

===Implications===
The implications of this theory raise important questions about both [[cognition]] and [[human behavior]]. In addition to streamlining cognition in complicated, analytical tasks, cognitive misers are also at work when dealing with unfamiliar issues as well as issues of great importance.&lt;ref name="Fiske&amp;Taylor1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nano/&gt; Voting behavior in democracies are an arena in which the cognitive miser is at work. Acting as a cognitive miser should lead those with expertise in an area to more efficient information processing and streamlined decision making.&lt;ref name=LauRedlawsk2001&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lau |first=Richard R. |author2=David P. Redlawsk |title=Advantages and disadvantages of cognitive heuristics in political decision making |journal=[[American Journal of Political Science]] |date=4 Oct 2001 |volume=45 |pages=951–971 |jstor=2669334 |doi=10.2307/2669334}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Lau and Redlawsk note, acting as cognitive miser who employs heuristics can have very different results for high-information and [[low-information voter]]s. They write, "...cognitive heuristics are at times employed by almost all voters, and that they are particularly likely to be used when the choice situation facing voters is complex... heuristic use generally increases the probability of a correct vote by political experts but decreases the probability of a correct vote by novices."&lt;ref name="LauRedlawsk2001"/&gt; In democracies, where no vote is weighted more or less because of the expertise behind its casting, low-information voters, acting as cognitive misers, can have broad and potentially deleterious choices for a society.&lt;ref name="LauRedlawsk2001"/&gt;

==Updates and later research==
Later models suggest that the cognitive miser and the naïve scientist create two poles of social cognition that are too monolithic. Instead, Fiske, Taylor, and [[Arie W. Kruglanski]] and other social psychologists offer an alternative explanation of social cognition: the [[motivated tactician]].&lt;ref name="Fiske&amp;Taylor1991"/&gt; According to this theory, people employ either shortcuts or thoughtful analysis based upon the context and salience of a particular issue. In other words, this theory suggests that humans are, in fact, ''both'' naive scientists and cognitive misers.&lt;ref name="CrispTurner2014"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2016}}

'''Comparative cognition''' is the comparative study of the mechanisms and origins of [[cognition]] in various [[species]], and is sometimes seen as more general than, or similar to, [[comparative psychology]].
From a biological point of view, work is being done on the brains of [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] that should yield techniques precise enough to allow an understanding of the workings of the human brain on a scale appreciative of individual groups of [[neurons]] rather than the more regional scale previously used. Similarly, gene activity in the human [[brain]] is better understood through examination of the brains of mice by the Seattle-based [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]] (see link below), yielding the freely available [[Allen Brain Atlas]]. This type of study is related to comparative cognition, but better classified as one of [[comparative genomics]]. Increasing emphasis in [[psychology]] and [[ethology]] on the biological aspects of [[perception]] and [[behavior]] is bridging the gap between [[genomics]] and [[behavioral analysis]].

In order for scientists to better understand cognitive function across a broad range of species they can systematically compare cognitive abilities between closely and distantly related species&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Horik|first=Jayden|last2=Emery|first2=Nathan J.|date=2011-11-01|title=Evolution of cognition|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=6|pages=621–633|doi=10.1002/wcs.144|pmid=26302412|issn=1939-5086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this process they can determine what kinds of selection pressure has led to different cognitive abilities across a broad range of animals. For example, it has been hypothesized that there is convergent evolution of the higher cognitive functions of corvids and apes, possibly due to both being omnivorous, visual animals that live in social groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Crown rabbi''' ({{lang-rus|казённый раввин|p=kɐˈzʲɵnːɨj rɐˈvʲːin|t=official rabbi}}) was a position in the [[Russian Empire]] given to a member of a [[Russian Jews|Jewish community]] appointed to act as an intermediary between his community and the Imperial government, to perform certain civil duties such as registering births, marriages, and divorces.  Because their main job qualification was fluency in [[Russian language|Russian]], crown rabbis were typically considered agents of the state by members of their own communities, not true [[rabbi]]s, and they often had no education in or knowledge of [[Jewish law]].

== History ==

The origins of the crown rabbinate in [[Imperial Russia]] date to the early 19th century and administrative requirements by the [[tsar]] that the Jewish community maintain and provide civil records to the Imperial government in the [[Russian language]].&lt;ref name="kehila"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/lyakhovichi/rabbonim.htm |title=Rabbonim, Rebbes, and Crown Rabbis of Lyakhovichi-An Original Publication of Lyakovichi Shtetl Website |last1=Glassman |first1=Deborah |date=December 2004 |website=jewishgen.org |publisher=Jewish Gen, Inc. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222181250/http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/lyakhovichi/Rabbonim.htm |archivedate=2015-02-22 |accessdate=2015-05-31 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion as agent of the state===

The Russian government viewed all permissible religions as agents of the state.  [[Russian Orthodox]] priests, [[Mennonite]] ministers, [[Roman Catholic|Catholics]] as well as Jewish rabbis{{ndash}}were all required to perform certain civil duties such as registering births, deaths, and marriages, as well as other duties.  The Russians found this arrangement useful, and employed designated members of these religious communities at a tiny salary (which could be augmented by bribes by the ambitious) to perform these official functions.&lt;ref name="kehila" /&gt;

===Language requirements under Alexander I===

[[Ukase]]s by [[Tsar Alexander I]] (reigned 1801{{ndash}}1825) required the rabbis to maintain civil information in [[Russian language|Russian]] as well as Hebrew.  [[Rabbis]] in the Empire all spoke [[Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish]], but few could speak Russian or other languages considered useful by the Empire such as German and Polish.  For this reason, the Jewish communities chose an individual familiar with Russian and other required languages to perform this role, and put his name forward.  If approved by the governmental administration, they became "official" rabbis, in the sense that they acted as the intermediary between their community and the Imperial government for the required civil and other administrative duties the government required of them.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe |editor-last1=Kaplan Appel |editor-first1=Tamar |editor-link1= |title=Crown Rabbi |last1= |first1= |author-link1= |url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Crown_Rabbi |date=3 August 2010 |publisher=Yale University Press |location= |edition= |series= |volume= |isbn=9780300119039 |oclc=170203576 |pages= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327120806/http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Crown_Rabbi |archivedate=2015-03-27 |accessdate=2015-05-31 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since rabbis most often did not speak Russian, the men put forth by the community typically were men who were not rabbis, and often they were not even particularly familiar with Jewish law.  Because of this, they were looked down upon by their communities as agents or puppets of the government, and not real rabbis, despite the title accorded them by the state.&lt;ref name="Berlin-2011"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion |editor-last1=Berlin |editor-first1=Adele |editor-link=Adele Berlin |last=Himelstein |first=Shmuel |title=Crown Rabbi |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hKAaJXvUaUoC&amp;pg=PA195 |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |volume= |isbn=978-0-19-973004-9 |language= |trans-title= |quote= }} p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution under Nicholas I===

This new position became more formalized under [[Tsar Nicholas I]] (reigned 1825{{ndash}}1855). In 1835, new laws established these appointees as employees and officials of the Imperial government.  While continuing their record-keeping duties as before, they were also now given religious authority by the state and were also to maintain loyalty to the state among their community.  It was under these new regulations that those occupying these official posts came to be called "crown rabbis".&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010" /&gt;

===Choosing a crown rabbi===

A crown rabbi was either appointed, or elected by members of the Jewish community in which he resided.  In Kiev, shortly after Jewish residents were permitted to settle in the city in 1861, a crown rabbi was appointed.  But the local community objected, and wished to elect someone with the education and stature that they could respect, and elected their own man, Evsei Tsukkerman, instead.  He was then approved by the government, and took up the position of crown rabbi.&lt;ref name="Meir-2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Meir |first=Natan M |date=2010 |orig-year= |title=Kiev, Jewish Metropolis: A History, 1859--1914 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Sc-UJsKq8gC&amp;dq |page=86  |location=[[Bloomington, IN]] |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |isbn=0253004330 |series=Kiev, Jewish Metropolis |doi=10.1080/09546545.2012.671454 |oclc=649479079 |access-date=2015-06-01 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State seminaries===

The crown rabbinate evolved, and by mid-century the government opened its own seminaries for training rabbis (supported by taxes on Jewish  communities) with a strong secular syllabus promoting the interests of the state.  The training was seven years undergraduate, followed by three years training in pedagogy or rabbinical studies.  Secular subjects were mandatory; the syllabus did include Rabbinic training ([[Talmud]], [[halakha]]) at the graduate level, but was optional and few graduates took it.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010" /&gt;

The first graduates emerged in the 1850s, and by the following decade, new laws were passed obliging the Jewish communities to hire these graduates, although there was a lot of resistance to them as they were viewed as poorly or uneducated in Jewish matters important to the community, and a bad influence because of their years of secular indoctrination.  Few graduates found positions, and the number of them graduating went down to a trickle.  Finally, the government closed the schools down in 1873, realizing that the Jewish community regarded them as unfit for the honored position of rabbi.  The position of crown rabbi outlasted the schools, and while the government viewed the crown rabbis as being the only official rabbis, the communities continued to have rabbis schooled in the traditional ways, with the result that many communities had two rabbis, an "official" one for dealing with the Tsar, and a "spiritual" rabbi for dealing with all the traditional religious and family roles that rabbis usually dealt with.  The official rabbis were universally viewed as agents of the state by the Jewish communities.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010" /&gt;

===The dual rabbinate===

The problem of the "dual rabbinate" continued until the 20th century and [[World War I]], with debates raging within the community itself about how to view and react to the situation.  The Orthodox accepted only their traditional spiritual rabbis as legitimate, while progressive Jews thought that rabbis should also play a role in secular concerns such as social, economic, and intellectual aspects of their communities.  Crown rabbis continued to perform their official duties all during this debate, and attended various Russian Rabbinic Congresses, such as the one in 1910.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010" /&gt;

At the 1910 Rabinic conference the objective was to get rid of the Crown Rabbinate entirely, but this ran into problems because the Orthodox delegates by and large refused to encourage or require their (legitimate, spiritual, educated) rabbis to take on the administrative tasks fulfilled by the crown rabbis because that would require their learning Russian and to submit to the licensing authority of the Russian state which was far too much in the secular domain for an Orthodox rabbi to go.  This caused a split among the delegates among those who saw nothing wrong with learning Russian and even thought it would avoid much of the misery the Jews had undergone, however this resulted in a stalemate and no new decisions were taken about it.&lt;ref name="Wert-2004"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Jack Wertheimer |date=2004-03-20 |title=Jewish Religious Leadership: In Eastern Europe ; In Western and Central Europe ; In the United States ; In North Africa and Israel ; The representation of Jewish leadership |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvUlAQAAIAAJ |volume=II |page=431 |chapter=Reflections on the Russian Rabbinate |last=Stanislawski |first=Michael |publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary |isbn=9780873340984 |doi= |oclc= |access-date=2015-06-02 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cuteness''' is a subjective term describing a type of [[Physical attractiveness|attractiveness]] commonly associated with [[youth]] and [[Human physical appearance|appearance]], as well as a scientific concept and analytical model in [[ethology]], first introduced by [[Konrad Lorenz]].&lt;ref&gt;Lorenz, Konrad. ''Studies in Animal and Human Behavior''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univ Press; 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz proposed the concept of baby schema (''Kindchenschema''), a set of facial and body features, that make a creature appear "cute" and activate ("release") in others the motivation to care for it.&lt;ref name="Glocker2"&gt;Glocker ML, Langleben DD, Ruparel K, Loughead JW, Valdez JN, Griffin MD, Sachser N, Gur RC.

== Juvenile traits ==
[[File:Kopfproportionen.svg|thumb|Change of head proportions (especially the relative size of the [[maxilla]] and [[mandible]]) as a function of age]]

Doug Jones, a [[visiting scholar]] in anthropology at [[Cornell University]],&lt;!-- His qualifications are given on the first page of the article. --&gt; said that the proportions of facial features change with age due to changes in hard tissue and soft tissue, and Jones said that these "age-related changes" cause juvenile animals to have the "characteristic 'cute' appearance" of proportionately smaller snouts, higher foreheads and larger eyes than their adult counterparts. In terms of hard tissue, Jones said that the [[neurocranium]] grows a lot in juveniles while the bones for the nose and the parts of the skull involved in chewing food only reach maximum growth later. In terms of soft tissue, Jones said that the [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] tissues of the ears and nose continue to grow throughout a person's lifetime, starting at age twenty-five the eyebrows descend on the "[[Supraorbital ridge|supraorbital rim]]" from a position above the supraorbital rim to a position below it, the "lateral aspect of the eyebrows" sags with age, making the eyes appear smaller, and the red part of the lips gets thinner with age due to loss of connective tissue.&lt;!-- This was found on page 728 at the bottom and 729 at the top. --&gt;&lt;ref name="DJones" /&gt;

A study found that the faces of "attractive"&lt;!-- The study did not use the word "cute", but an "attractive" child's face would normally be interpreted as being synonymous with a cute child's face.--&gt; [[Northern Italy|Northern Italian]] Caucasian&lt;!-- On page 595, Sforza says the study used Northern Italian Caucasians.--&gt; children have "characteristics of babyness" such as a "larger forehead", a smaller jaw, "a proportionately larger and more prominent [[maxilla]]", a wider face, a flatter face and larger "[[anteroposterior]]" facial dimensions than the Northern Italian Caucasian children used as a [[reference]].&lt;!-- This information is on page 604.

===Biological function===
Konrad Lorenz argued in 1949 that infantile features triggered nurturing responses in adults and that this was an evolutionary adaptation which helped ensure that adults cared for their children, ultimately securing the survival of the species. Some later scientific studies have provided further evidence for Lorenz's theory. For example, it has been shown that human adults react positively to infants who are [[stereotype|stereotypically]] cute. Studies have also shown that responses to cuteness—and to facial attractiveness in general—seem to be similar across and within cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Van Duuren, Mike; Kendell-Scott, Linda; Stark, Natalie. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927105817/http://www.winchester.ac.uk/view.ashx?Item=15993 "Early Aesthetic Choices: Infant Preferences for Attractive Premature Infant Faces"] (PDF), King Alfred's College. Archived from [http://www.winchester.ac.uk/view.ashx?Item=15993 the original].&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by Stephan Hamann of [[Emory University]], he found using an [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]], that cute pictures increased brain activity in the [[Orbitofrontal cortex|orbital frontal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Agreed, Baby Pandas Are Cute.

==Growth pattern of children==
Desmond Collins, who was an Extension Lecturer of Archaeology at [[London University]],&lt;ref&gt;(1970). Special Issue: Early Man. World Archaeology Volume 2, Issue 1, DOI: 10.1080/00438243.1970.9979467 page 112 [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00438243.1970.9979467?journalCode=rwar20#.VGwIFYdYvls link]&lt;/ref&gt; said that the lengthened youth period of humans is part of [[neoteny]].&lt;!-- This is on page 15.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;Collins, D. et al. (1973). Background to archaeology: Britain in its European setting. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-20155-1}} hard cover&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical anthropologist [[Barry Bogin]] said that the pattern of children's growth may intentionally increase the duration of their cuteness. Bogin said that the human brain reaches adult size when the body is only 40 percent complete, when "dental maturation is only 58 percent complete" and when "reproductive maturation is only 10 percent complete". Bogin said that this [[allometry]] of human growth allows children to have a "superficially infantile" appearance (large [[skull]], small face, small body and sexual underdevelopment) longer than in other "[[mammal]]ian species". Bogin said that this cute appearance causes a "nurturing" and "care-giving" response in "older individuals".&lt;!-- This was on page 83.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bogin, B. (1997). Evolutionary Hypotheses for Human Childhood. Yearbook of Physical Anthropology, vol. 40, pp. 63–89&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender differences ==
The perceived cuteness of an infant is influenced by the [[gender]] and behavior of the infant.&lt;ref name=Koyama&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koyama|first=Reiko |author2=Takahashi, Yuwen |author3=Mori, Kazuo|title=Assessing the cuteness of children: Significant factors and gender differences|journal=Social Behavior and Personality|year=2006|volume=34|pages=1087–1100|doi=10.2224/sbp.2006.34.9.1087|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Karraker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karraker|first=Katherine|author2=Stern, Marilyn|title=Infant physical attractiveness and facial expression: Effects on adult perceptions|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15324834basp1104_2#.UihZBbwic38|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|year=1990|volume=11|pages=371–385|doi=10.1207/s15324834basp1104_2|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Koyama et al. (2006) research, female infants are seen as cute for the physical attraction that female infants display more than male infants;&lt;ref name=Koyama /&gt; whereas research by Karraker (1990) demonstrates that a caregiver's attention and involvement in the male infant's protection could be solely based on the perception of happiness and attractiveness of the child.&lt;ref name=Karraker /&gt;

The gender of an observer can determine their perception of the difference in cuteness. In a study by Sprengelmeyer et al. (2009) it was suggested that women were more sensitive to small differences in cuteness than the same aged men. This suggests that reproductive [[hormone]]s in women are important for determining cuteness.&lt;ref name="Sprengelmeyer, R 2009 PP 149-154"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sprengelmeyer | first1 = R | last2 = Perrett | first2 = D. | last3 = Fagan | first3 = E. | last4 = Cornwell | first4 = R. | last5 = Lobmaier | first5 = J. | last6 = Sprengelmeyer | first6 = A. | last7 = Aasheim | first7 = H. | last8 = Black | first8 = I. | last9 = Cameron | first9 = L. | last10 = Crow | first10 = S. | last11 = Milne | first11 = N. | last12 = Rhodes | first12 = E. | last13 = Young | first13 = A. | year = 2009 | title = The Cutest Little Baby Face: A Hormonal Link to Sensitivity to Cuteness in Infant Faces | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 20 | issue = 9| pages = 149–154 | pmid = 19175530 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02272.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This finding has also been demonstrated in a study conducted by T.R. Alley in which he had 25 undergraduate students (consisting of 7 men and 18 women) rate cuteness of infants depending on different characteristics such as age, behavioral traits, and physical characteristics such as head shape, and facial feature configuration.&lt;ref name="Alley"/&gt;

==Preference in young children==
Borgi et al. stated that young children demonstrate a preference for faces with a more "infantile facial" arrangement i.e. a rounder face, a higher forehead, bigger eyes, a smaller nose and a smaller mouth.&lt;!-- This was found in the "BABY SCHEMA AND CUTENESS PERCEPTION" section. --&gt; In a study that used three- to six-year-old children, Borgi et al. asserted that the children showed a viewing time preference toward the eyes of "high infantile" faces of dogs, cats and humans as opposed to "low infantile" faces of those three species.&lt;!-- This was found in the paragraph immediately before the "Discussion" section. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borgi, M. et al. (2014). Baby schema in human and animal faces induces cuteness perception and gaze allocation in children. In Frontiers in Psychology. 5(411).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hormones and cuteness variation ==
There are suggestions that hormone levels can affect a person's perception of cuteness. Konrad Lorenz suggests that "caretaking behaviour and affective orientation" towards infants as an innate mechanism, and this is triggered by cute characteristics such as "chubby cheeks" and large eyes. The Sprengelmeyer et al. (2009) study expands on this claim by manipulating baby pictures to test groups on their ability to detect differences in cuteness. The studies show that [[menopause|premenopausal]] women detected cuteness better than same aged postmenopausal women. Furthermore, to support this claim, women taking [[birth control pill]]s that raise levels of reproductive hormones detect cuteness better than same aged women not taking the pill.&lt;ref name="Sprengelmeyer, R 2009 PP 149-154"/&gt;

Sprengelmeyer gathered 24 young women, 24 young men, and 24 older women to participate in his study. He ran three studies in which images of white European babies were shown, and the participants were asked to rate them on a cuteness scale of one to seven. The study found differences among the groups in cuteness discrimination, which ruled out [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] and social influences on perceived cuteness. In the second study it was found that premenopausal women discriminated cuteness at a higher level than their postmenopausal female peers. This finding suggested a biological factor, which was then investigated further in the third study. Here, Sprengelmeyer compared cuteness sensitivity between premenopausal women who were, and were not taking oral contraceptives. The study concluded that post-perceptual processes were impacted by hormone levels ([[progesterone]] and [[estrogen]] specifically) in females, and thus impacted sensitivity to cuteness.&lt;ref name="Sprengelmeyer, R 2009 PP 149-154"/&gt;

== Caregiving correlates ==
A study by Konrad Lorenz in the early 1940s found that the shape of an infant's head positively correlated with adult caregiving and an increased perception of "cute". However a study by Thomas Alley found no such correlation and pointed out faulty procedures in that study. Alley's study found that cephalic head shape of an infant did induce a positive response from adults, and these children were considered to be more "cute". In his study, Alley had 25 undergraduate students rate line drawings of an infant's face. The same drawing was used each time, however the cephalic head shape was changed using a cardioidal transformation (a transformation that models cephalic growth in relation to ageing process) to adjust the perceived age; other features of the face were not changed.  The study concluded that a large head shape increased perceived cuteness, which then elicited a positive response in adult caretaking. The study also noted that perceived cuteness was also dependent on other physical and behavioural characteristics of the child, including age.&lt;ref name="Alley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alley|first=Thomas|title=Head shape and the perception of cuteness|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1981-32782-001|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1981|volume=17|issue=5|pages=650–654|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.17.5.650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study by McCabe (1984) of children whose ages ranged from toddlers to teenagers, the children with more "adult-like" facial proportions were more likely to have experienced physical abuse than children of the same age who had less "adult-like" facial proportions.&lt;!--This is on the bottom of page 136.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, V. &amp; Young, A.

A study by Karraker (1990) suggested that "an adult's beliefs about the [[personality]] and expected behavior of an infant can influence the adult's interaction with the infant", and gave evidence that in this way "basic cuteness effects may occasionally be obscured in particular infants".&lt;ref name=Karraker /&gt; Koyama (2006) said that an adult caregiver's perception of an infant's cuteness can motivate the amount of care and protection the caregiver provides, and the admiration demonstrated toward the infant, and concluded that "the adults' protective feeling for children appeared to be a more important criterion for the judgment of a boy's cuteness."&lt;ref name=Koyama /&gt;

Melanie Glocker (2009) provided experimental evidence that infants' cuteness motivates caretaking in adults, even if they are not related to the infant.&lt;ref name=Glocker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glocker|first=Melanie|author2=Daniel D.

The research suggested that individuals' rating of the perceived cuteness of an infant corresponded to the level of motivation an individual had to care for this infant.&lt;ref name=Glocker /&gt; Glocker and colleagues then used [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), to demonstrate that baby faces with higher content of baby schema features, generated more activation in the [[nucleus accumbens]], a small brain area central to motivation and reward.&lt;ref name="Glocker2" /&gt; This work elucidated the neural mechanism through which baby schema (''Kindchenschema'') may motivate ("release") caretaking behavior. Furthermore, cute infants were more likely to be [[adoption|adopted]] and rated as more "likeable, friendly, healthy and competent" than infants who were less cute. There is an implication that baby schema response is crucial to human development because it lays the foundation for care giving and the relationship between child and caretaker.&lt;ref name=Glocker/&gt;

Doug Jones, a [[visiting scholar]] in anthropology at [[Cornell University]],&lt;!-- His qualifications are given on the first page of the article. --&gt; said that the faces of monkeys, dogs, birds and even the fronts of cars can be made to appear cuter by morphing them with a "[[cardioid]]al" ([[Heart (symbol)|heart-shaped]]) [[Transformation (function)|mathematical transformation]]. Jones said that negative cardioidal strain results in faces appearing less mature and cuter by causing facial features at the top of the face to expand outward and upward while causing features at the bottom of the face to contract inward and upward.&lt;!-- This was at the bottom of page 728. --&gt;&lt;ref name="DJones"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=D.|display-authors=etal|title=Sexual Selection, Physical Attractiveness, and Facial Neoteny: Cross-cultural Evidence and Implications [and Comments and Reply]|journal=Current Anthropology|date=December 1995|volume=36|issue=5|pages=723–748|url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1601&amp;context=fchd_facpub|accessdate=22 January 2017|doi=10.1086/204427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] said that over time [[Mickey Mouse]] had been drawn to resemble a juvenile more with a relatively larger head, larger eyes, a larger and more bulging [[cranium]], a less sloping and more rounded forehead, shorter, thicker and "pudgier" legs, thicker arms and a thicker snout which gave the appearance of being less protrusive. Gould suggested that this change in Mickey's image was intended to increase his popularity by making him appear cuter and "inoffensive".&lt;!-- This was at the bottom of the first page. --&gt; Gould said that the neotenous changes to Mickey's form were similar to the [[Neoteny#Human evolution|neotenous changes that occurred in human evolution]].&lt;!--This was at the bottom of the third page. --&gt;&lt;ref name="Mickey"&gt;Gould, S.J.

She said Mickey Mouse's bodily proportions "aged in reverse" since his inception, because "[h]is eyes and head kept getting bigger while his limbs kept getting shorter and thicker", culminating in him resembling a "human infant".

[[Image:Alembert.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jean d'Alembert]] (1717—1783)]]
'''D'Alembert's principle''', also known as the '''Lagrange–d'Alembert principle''', is a statement of the fundamental [[classical physics|classical]] laws of motion. It is named after its discoverer, the [[France|French]] [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]].  It is the dynamic analogue to the ''principle of [[virtual work]] for applied forces'' in a static system and in fact is  more general than [[Hamilton's principle]], avoiding restriction to [[holonomic system]]s.&lt;ref name=Lanczos&gt;{{cite book |last=Lanczos |first=Cornelius |title=The Variational Principles of Mechanics |edition=4th |year=1970 |isbn=0-486-65067-7 |publisher=Dover Publications Inc. |location=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWoYYr8wk2IC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=%22d%27Alembert%27s+principle%22 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; A holonomic constraint depends only on the coordinates and time. It does not depend on the velocities. If the negative terms in accelerations are recognized as ''[[inertial force]]s'', the statement of d'Alembert's principle becomes ''The total virtual work of the impressed forces plus the inertial forces vanishes for reversible displacements''.&lt;ref name=Lanczos2&gt;{{cite book |title=p. 90 |author=Cornelius Lanczos   |isbn=0-486-65067-7 |year=1970 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWoYYr8wk2IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22d%27Alembert%27s+principle%22#PPA90,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The principle does not apply for irreversible displacements, such as sliding [[friction]], and more general specification of the irreversibility is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Udwadia | first1 = F. E. | last2 = Kalaba | first2 = R. E. | title = On the Foundations of Analytical Dynamics | journal = Intl. Journ. Nonlinear Mechanics | volume = 37 | issue = 6 | pages = 1079–1090 | date = 2002 | url = http://ae-www.usc.edu/bio/udwadia/papers/On_foundation_of_analytical_dynamics.pdf | doi = 10.1016/S0020-7462(01)00033-6 | bibcode = 2002IJNLM..37.1079U | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100613031338/http://ae-www.usc.edu/bio/udwadia/papers/On_foundation_of_analytical_dynamics.pdf | archivedate = 2010-06-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle states that the sum of the differences between the [[force]]s acting on a system of mass particles and the time [[derivative]]s of the [[momentum|momenta]] of the system itself projected onto any [[virtual displacement]] consistent with the constraints of the system is zero. Thus, in symbols d'Alembert's principle is written as following,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i} ( \mathbf {F}_{i} - m_i \mathbf{a}_i )\cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where :

:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; || is an integer used to indicate (via subscript) a variable corresponding to a particular particle in the system,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {F}_i&lt;/math&gt; || is the total applied force (excluding constraint forces) on the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle,
|-
| &lt;math&gt; m_i \scriptstyle&lt;/math&gt; || is the mass of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\mathbf a_i&lt;/math&gt; || is the acceleration of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;m_i \mathbf a_i&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; || together as product represents the time derivative of the momentum of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle if the masses do not change with time, and
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf r_i&lt;/math&gt; || is the virtual displacement of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th particle, consistent with the constraints.
|}

This above equation is often called d'Alembert's principle, but it was first written in this variational form by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold Sommerfeld]] (1956), ''Mechanics:  Lectures on Theoretical Physics'', Vol 1, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  D'Alembert's contribution was to demonstrate that in the totality of a dynamic system the forces of constraint vanish.  That is to say that the [[generalized forces]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf Q}_{j}&lt;/math&gt; need not include constraint forces.  It is equivalent to the somewhat more cumbersome [[Gauss's principle of least constraint]].

==General case with changing masses==
The general statement of d'Alembert's principle mentions "the time [[derivative]]s of the [[momentum|momenta]] of the system". The momentum of the ''i''-th mass is the product of its mass and velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_i = m_i \mathbf v_i&lt;/math&gt;

and its time derivative is

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{p}_i} = \dot{m}_i \mathbf{v}_i + m_i \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i&lt;/math&gt;.

In many applications, the masses are constant and this equation reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{p}_i} = m_i \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i = m_i \mathbf{a}_i&lt;/math&gt;,

which appears in the formula given above. However, some applications involve changing masses (for example, chains being rolled up or being unrolled) and in those cases both terms &lt;math&gt;\dot{m}_i \mathbf{v}_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_i \dot{\mathbf{v}}_i&lt;/math&gt; have to remain present, giving

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i} ( \mathbf {F}_{i} - m_i \mathbf{a}_i - \dot{m}_i \mathbf{v}_i)\cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivation for special cases==
To date, nobody has shown that D'Alembert's principle is equivalent to [[Newton's second law of motion|Newton's Second Law]]. D'Alembert's principle is a more general case .  And it is true only for some very special cases e.g. rigid body constraints.  However, an approximate solution to this problem does exist.&lt;ref name="Rebhan2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rebhan |first=Eckhard |title=Mechanik |series=Theoretische Physik |year=2006 |publisher=Spektrum Akademischer Verlag |location=Heidelberg, Germany  |isbn=978-3-8274-1716-9 |chapter=Exkurs 5.1: Ableitung des d'Alembert Prinzips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider Newton's law for a system of particles, i. The total force on each particle is&lt;ref name="Torby1984"&gt;{{cite book |last=Torby |first=Bruce |title=Advanced Dynamics for Engineers |series=HRW Series in Mechanical Engineering |year=1984 |publisher=CBS College Publishing |location=United States of America  |isbn=0-03-063366-4 |chapter=Energy Methods}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf {F}_{i}^{(T)} = m_i \mathbf {a}_i,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {F}_{i}^{(T)}&lt;/math&gt; || are the total forces acting on the system's particles,
|-
| &lt;math&gt;m_i \mathbf {a}_i&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; || are the inertial forces that result from the total forces.
|}

Moving the inertial forces to the left gives an expression that can be considered to represent quasi-static equilibrium, but which is really just a small algebraic manipulation of Newton's law:&lt;ref name="Torby1984"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf {F}_{i}^{(T)} - m_i \mathbf {a}_i = \mathbf 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Considering the [[virtual work]], &lt;math&gt;\delta W&lt;/math&gt;, done by the total and inertial forces together through an arbitrary virtual displacement, &lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf r_i&lt;/math&gt;, of the system leads to a zero identity, since the forces involved sum to zero for each particle.&lt;ref name="Torby1984"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = \sum_{i} \mathbf {F}_{i}^{(T)} \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i - \sum_{i} m_i \mathbf{a}_i \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The original vector equation could be recovered by recognizing that the work expression must hold for arbitrary displacements. Separating the total forces into applied forces, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F_i&lt;/math&gt;, and constraint forces, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf C_i&lt;/math&gt;, yields&lt;ref name="Torby1984"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = \sum_{i} \mathbf {F}_{i} \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i + \sum_{i} \mathbf {C}_{i} \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i - \sum_{i} m_i \mathbf{a}_i \cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

If arbitrary virtual displacements are assumed to be in directions that are orthogonal to the constraint forces (which is not usually the case, so this derivation works only for special cases), the constraint forces do no work. Such displacements are said to be ''consistent'' with the constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|title = Teaching Students Work and Virtual Work Method in Statics:A Guiding Strategy with Illustrative Examples|first = Ing-Chang|last = Jong|conference = 2005 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference &amp; Exposition|year = 2005|url = http://search.asee.org/search/fetch?url=file%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2FE%3A%2Fsearch%2Fconference%2F29%2FAC%25202005Paper1212.pdf&amp;index=conference_papers&amp;space=129746797203605791716676178&amp;type=application%2Fpdf&amp;charset=|accessdate = June 24, 2014|section = Improving Mechanics of Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the formulation of ''d'Alembert's principle'', which states that the difference of applied forces and inertial forces for a dynamic system does no virtual work:.&lt;ref name="Torby1984"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = \sum_{i} ( \mathbf {F}_{i} - m_i \mathbf{a}_i )\cdot \delta \mathbf r_i = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

There is also a corresponding principle for static systems called the [[virtual work#Principle of virtual work for applied forces|principle of virtual work for applied forces]].

==D'Alembert's principle of inertial forces==
D'Alembert showed that one can transform an accelerating rigid body into an equivalent static system by adding the so-called "[[inertial force]]"  and "[[inertial torque]]" or moment. The inertial force must act through the center of mass and the inertial torque can act anywhere. The system can then be analyzed exactly as a static system subjected to this "inertial force and moment" and the external forces. The advantage is that, in the equivalent static system one can take moments about any point (not just the center of mass). This often leads to simpler calculations because any force (in turn) can be eliminated from the moment equations by choosing the appropriate point about which to apply the moment equation (sum of moments = zero). Even in the course of Fundamentals of Dynamics and Kinematics of machines, this principle helps in analyzing the forces that act on a link of a mechanism when it is in motion. In textbooks of engineering dynamics this is sometimes referred to as ''d'Alembert's principle''.

===Example for 1D motion of a rigid body===
[[File:Dalembert example.JPG|thumb|280x280px|Free body diagram of a wire pulling on a mass with weight W, showing the d’Alembert inertia “force” ma.
]]
To illustrate the concept of ''d'Alembert's principle'', let's use a simple model with a weight''' '''&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, suspended from a wire. The weight is subjected to a gravitational force, &lt;math&gt;W=mg&lt;/math&gt;, and a tension force &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;''' '''in the wire. The mass accelerates upward with an acceleration &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. [[Newton's second law of motion|Newton's Second Law]] becomes &lt;math&gt;T-W=ma&lt;/math&gt;''''' '''''or &lt;math&gt;T=W+ma&lt;/math&gt;. As an observer with feet planted firmly on the ground, we see that the force &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; accelerates the weight, &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;, but, if we are moving with the wire we don’t see the acceleration, we feel it. The tension in the wire seems to counteract an acceleration “force” &lt;math&gt;ma&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(W/g)a&lt;/math&gt;.
[[File:Rigid Body in Free Fall with Angular Velocity.JPG|thumb|300x300px|Free body diagram depicting an inertia moment and an inertia force on a rigid body in free fall with an angular velocity.]]

===Example for plane 2D motion of a rigid body===
For a planar rigid body, moving in the plane of the body (the ''x''–''y'' plane), and subjected to forces and torques causing rotation only in this plane, the inertial force is

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_i = - m\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_c&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_c&lt;/math&gt; is the position vector of the centre of mass of the body, and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the body. The inertial torque (or moment) is

:&lt;math&gt;T_i = -I\ddot{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[moment of inertia]] of the body. If, in addition to the external forces and torques acting on the body, the inertia force acting through the center of mass is added and the inertial torque is added (acting around the centre of mass is as good as anywhere) the system is equivalent to one in static equilibrium. Thus the equations of static equilibrium

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \sum F_x &amp;= 0,
  \\
  \sum F_y &amp;= 0,
  \\
  \sum T &amp;= 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

hold. The important thing is that &lt;math&gt;\sum T&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of torques (or moments, including the inertial moment and the moment of the inertial force) taken about ''any'' point. The direct application of Newton's laws requires that the angular acceleration equation be applied ''only'' about the center of mass.

===Dynamic equilibrium===
D'Alembert's form of the principle of virtual work states that a system of rigid bodies is in dynamic equilibrium when the virtual work of the sum of the applied forces and the inertial forces is zero for any virtual displacement of the system.  Thus, dynamic equilibrium of a system of n rigid bodies with m generalized coordinates requires that is to be
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W = (Q_1 + Q^*_1)\delta q_1 + \ldots + (Q_m + Q^*_m)\delta q_m = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
for any set of virtual displacements δq&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;.  This condition yields m equations,
:&lt;math&gt; Q_j + Q^*_j = 0, \quad j=1, \ldots, m,&lt;/math&gt;
which can also be written as
:&lt;math&gt;  \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{q}_j} -\frac{\partial T}{\partial q_j} = Q_j, \quad j=1,\ldots,m.&lt;/math&gt;
The result is a set of m equations of motion that define the dynamics of the rigid body system.

See [[Group technology]]. The algorithm is executable in manual way but was already suitable for computer use of the time.&lt;br /&gt;
The [[cellular manufacturing]] structure consists of several machine groups (production cells) where corresponding product groups (products with similar technology) are being exclusively manufactured. In aim of identification of possible cellular manufacturing structure within an existing manufacturing shop the DCA methodology roughly provides following procedure:
# Setting up a matrix where one dimension represents machines, the other products. All intersections where a product requires a machine is filled with "1", all others are filled with "0".
# The position of the columns and order of the rows is than changed. The algorithm provides the rules for column changing and row changing in aim of concentration of matrix cells containing "1" in several groups.
# The resulting matrix shows groups of products with corresponding machines aligned by the matrix diagonal.
== The experience ==
The DCA methodology would give a perfect result in an ideal case where there are no overlapping machines or products between the groups. The overlapping in most real cases represents further challenge for the methodology users.

Murugan and V. Selladurai shows the comparison of DCA to some other methodologies of the same purpose.

The '''Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox''' ('''EPR paradox''') is a [[thought experiment]] proposed by physicists [[Albert Einstein]], [[Boris Podolsky]] and [[Nathan Rosen]] (EPR) that they interpreted as indicating that the explanation of physical reality provided by Quantum Mechanics was incomplete.&lt;ref name="EPR"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete? | date = 1935-05-15 | first = A | last = Einstein |author2=B Podolsky |author3=N Rosen  | journal = [[Physical Review]] | volume = 47 | issue = 10 | pages = 777–780 | url=http://www.drchinese.com/David/EPR.pdf |bibcode = 1935PhRv...47..777E |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.47.777 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1935 paper titled ''Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete?'', they attempted to mathematically show that the [[wave function]] does not contain complete information about physical reality, and hence the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is unsatisfactory; resolutions of the paradox have important implications for the [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]].

The work was done at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton University in 1934, which Einstein [[Albert_Einstein#1933:_Emigration_to_the_US|had joined the prior year]] after he had fled Nazi Germany. 

[[File:Einstein.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Albert Einstein]]]] The essence of the paradox is that particles can interact in such a way that it is possible to measure both their position and their momentum more accurately than [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]] allows, unless measuring one particle instantaneously affects the other to prevent this accuracy, which would involve information being transmitted faster than light as forbidden by the [[theory of relativity]] ("[[action at a distance (physics)|spooky action at a distance]]"). This consequence had not previously been noticed and seemed unreasonable at the time; the phenomenon involved is now known as [[quantum entanglement]].

== History of EPR developments ==
The article that first brought forth these matters, "Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?" was published in 1935.&lt;ref name="EPR"/&gt; The paper prompted a response by Bohr, which he published in the same journal, in the same year, using the same title.&lt;ref name='Bohr1935'&gt;{{cite journal |title=Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete? |date=1935-10-13 |first=N. |last=Bohr |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=48 |issue=8 |pages=696–702 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.48.696|bibcode=1935PhRv...48..696B |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/1060284/files/PhysRev.48.696.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There followed a debate between Bohr and Einstein about the fundamental nature of reality. Einstein had been skeptical of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the role of chance in quantum theory.  But the crux of this debate was not about chance, but something even deeper: Is there one objective physical reality, which every observer sees from his own vantage? (Einstein's view)  Or does the observer co-create physical reality by the questions he poses with experiments? (Bohr's view)

Einstein struggled to the end of his life for a theory that could better comply with his idea of [[Causality (physics)|causality]], protesting against the view that there exists no objective physical reality other than that which is revealed through measurement interpreted in terms of quantum mechanical formalism. However, since Einstein's death, experiments analogous to the one described in the EPR paper have been carried out, starting in 1976 by French scientists Lamehi-Rachti and Mittig&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dkaCKHKLo3gC&amp;pg=PA330&amp;lpg=PA330&amp;dq=%22Saclay%22+%22Bell%27s+inequality%22&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2 Advances in atomic and molecular physics, Volume 14 By David Robert Bates]&lt;/ref&gt;  at the [[Saclay Nuclear Research Centre]]. These experiments appear to show that the [[local realism]] idea is false,&lt;ref name='Gribbin'&gt;{{cite book |title=In Search of Schrödinger's Cat |publisher=Black Swan |year=1984 |first=J. |last=Gribbin |isbn=978-0-7045-3071-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; vindicating Bohr.

Per EPR, the paradox demonstrated that quantum theory was incomplete, and needed to be extended with [[hidden variable theory|hidden variables]]. One modern resolution is as follows: for two "entangled" particles created at once (e.g., an electron-positron pair from a photon), measurable properties have well-defined meaning only for the ensemble system. Properties of constituent subsystems (e.g., the individual electron or positron), considered individually, remain undefined. Therefore, if analogous measurements are performed on the two entangled subsystems, there will always be a correlation between the outcomes, and a well-defined global outcome for the ensemble. However, the outcomes for each subsystem, considered separately, at each repetition of the experiment, will not be well defined or predictable. This correlation does not imply that measurements performed on one particle influence measurements on the other. This modern resolution eliminates the need for hidden variables, action at a distance, or other schemes introduced over time, in order to explain the phenomenon.

According to quantum mechanics, under some conditions, a pair of quantum systems may be described by a single [[wave function]], which encodes the probabilities of the outcomes of experiments that may be performed on the two systems, whether jointly or individually. At the time the EPR article discussed below was written, it was known from experiments that the outcome of an experiment sometimes cannot be uniquely predicted. An example of such indeterminacy can be seen when a beam of light is incident on a [[half-silvered mirror]]. One half of the beam will reflect, and the other will pass. If the intensity of the beam is reduced until only one photon is in transit at any time, whether that photon will reflect or transmit cannot be predicted quantum mechanically.

The routine explanation of this effect was, at that time, provided by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Physical quantities come in pairs called [[conjugate quantities]]. Examples of such conjugate pairs are (Position, momentum), (Time, energy), and (Angular position, angular momentum). When one quantity was measured, and became determined, the conjugated quantity became indeterminate. Heisenberg explained this uncertainty as due to the quantization of the disturbance from measurement.

The EPR paper, written in 1935, was intended to illustrate that this explanation is inadequate. It considered two [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] particles, referred to as A and B, and pointed out that measuring a quantity of a particle A will cause the conjugated quantity of particle B to become undetermined, even if there was no contact, no classical disturbance. The basic idea was that the quantum states of two particles in a system cannot always be decomposed from the joint state of the two, as is the case for the [[Bell state]], &lt;math&gt;|\Phi^+\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(|00\rangle+|11\rangle\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Heisenberg's principle was an attempt to provide a classical explanation of a quantum effect sometimes called [[Quantum nonlocality|non-locality]]. According to EPR there were two possible explanations.  Either there was some interaction between the particles (Even though they were separated) or the information about the outcome of all possible measurements was already present in both particles.

The EPR authors preferred the second explanation according to which that information was encoded in some '[[Hidden variable theory#EPR paradox|hidden parameters]]'. The first explanation of an effect propagating instantly across a distance is in conflict with the [[theory of relativity]]. They then concluded that quantum mechanics was incomplete since its formalism does not permit hidden parameters.

Violations of the conclusions of Bell's theorem are generally understood to have demonstrated that the hypotheses of Bell's theorem, also assumed by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen, do not apply in our world.&lt;ref name=Gaasbeek2010&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint= 1007.3977v1 |class=quant-ph|last= Gaasbeek |first= Bram |title= Demystifying the Delayed Choice Experiments |date= Jul 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most physicists who have examined the issue concur that experiments, such as those of [[Alain Aspect]] and his group, have confirmed that physical probabilities, as predicted by quantum theory, do exhibit the phenomena of Bell-inequality violations that are considered to invalidate EPR's preferred "local hidden-variables" type of explanation for the correlations to which EPR first drew attention.&lt;ref name=Bell1964&gt;Bell, John.

== Quantum mechanics and its interpretation ==
{{main article|Interpretations of quantum mechanics}}
Since the early twentieth century, quantum theory has proved to be successful in describing accurately the physical reality of the [[mesoscopic scale|mesoscopic]] and microscopic world, in multiple reproducible physics experiments.

Quantum mechanics was developed with the aim of describing atoms and explaining the observed spectral lines in a measurement apparatus. Although disputed especially in the early twentieth century, it has yet to be seriously challenged. Philosophical interpretations of quantum phenomena, however, are another matter: the question of how to ''interpret'' the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics has given rise to a variety of different answers from people of different philosophical persuasions (see [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]]).

Quantum theory and quantum mechanics do not provide single measurement outcomes in a deterministic way. According to the understanding of quantum mechanics known as the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], measurement causes an instantaneous collapse of the [[wave function]] describing the quantum system into an [[eigenstate]] of the [[observable]] that was measured. Einstein characterized this imagined collapse in the [[Solvay conference#Fifth Conference|1927 Solvay Conference]]. He presented a [[Einstein's thought experiments|thought experiment]] in which electrons are introduced through a small hole in a sphere whose inner surface serves as a detection screen. The electrons will contact the spherical detection screen in a widely dispersed manner. Those electrons, however, are all individually described by wave fronts that expand in all directions from the point of entry. A wave as it is understood in everyday life would paint a large area of the detection screen, but the electrons would be found to impact the screen at single points and would eventually form a pattern in keeping with the probabilities described by their identical wave functions. Einstein asks what makes each electron's wave front "collapse" at its respective location. Why do the electrons appear as single bright scintillations rather than as dim washes of energy across the surface? Why does any single electron appear at one point rather than some alternative point? The behavior of the electrons gives the impression of some signal having been sent to all possible points of contact that would have nullified all but one of them, or, in other words, would have preferentially selected a single point to the exclusion of all others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-epr/ The Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen Argument in Quantum Theory (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Einstein's opposition==
Einstein was the most prominent opponent of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]]. In his view, quantum mechanics was incomplete. Commenting on this, other writers (such as [[John von Neumann]]&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann, J. (1932/1955). In ''Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik'', Springer, Berlin, translated into English by Beyer, R.T., Princeton University Press, Princeton, cited by Baggott, J. (2004) ''Beyond Measure: Modern physics, philosophy, and the meaning of quantum theory'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, {{ISBN|0-19-852927-9}}, pages 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Bohm]]&lt;ref&gt;Bohm, D. (1951). [https://books.google.com/books?id=9DWim3RhymsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=david+bohm+quantum+theory&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6G-2u1wtav&amp;sig=Q1GcoVDLFRmKOmDYFAJte6LzrZU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Pv45TNSnLYffcfnS6foO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Quantum Theory''], Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, page 29, and Chapter 5 section 3, and Chapter 22 Section 19.&lt;/ref&gt;) hypothesized that consequently there would have to be [[hidden variable theory|'hidden' variables]] responsible for random measurement results, something which was not expressly claimed in the original paper.

The [[1935 in science|1935]] EPR paper&lt;ref name="EPR"/&gt; condensed the philosophical discussion into a physical argument. The authors claim that given a specific experiment, in which the outcome of a measurement is known before the measurement takes place, there must exist something in the real world, an "element of reality", that determines the measurement outcome. They postulate that these elements of reality are [[principle of locality|local]], in the sense that each belongs to a certain point in [[spacetime]]. Each element may only be influenced by events which are located in the backward [[light cone]] of its point in spacetime (i.e., the past). These claims are founded on assumptions about nature that constitute what is now known as [[local realism]].

Though the EPR paper has often been taken as an exact expression of Einstein's views, it was primarily authored by Podolsky, based on discussions at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] with Einstein and Rosen. Einstein later expressed to [[Erwin Schrödinger]] that, "it did not come out as well as I had originally wanted; rather, the essential thing was, so to speak, smothered by the formalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Description of the paradox ==
The original EPR paradox challenges the prediction of quantum mechanics that it is impossible to know both the position and the momentum of a quantum particle. This challenge can be extended to other pairs of physical properties.

===EPR paper===
The original paper purports to describe what must happen to "two systems I and II, which we permit to interact ...", and, after some time, "we suppose that there is no longer any interaction between the two parts." As explained by [[Manjit Kumar]] (2009), the EPR description involves "two particles, A and B, [which] interact briefly and then move off in opposite directions."&lt;ref name=Kumar2011&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]], it is impossible to measure both the momentum and the position of particle B exactly. However, it is possible to measure the exact position of particle A. By calculation, therefore, with the exact position of particle A known, the exact position of particle B can be known. Alternatively, the exact momentum of particle A can be measured, so the exact momentum of particle B can be worked out. Kumar writes: "EPR argued that they had proved that ... [particle] B can have simultaneously exact values of position and momentum. ... Particle B has a position that is real and a momentum that is real."&lt;blockquote&gt; EPR appeared to have contrived a means to establish the exact values of ''either'' the momentum ''or'' the position of B due to measurements made on particle A, without the slightest possibility of particle B being physically disturbed.&lt;ref name=Kumar2011/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
EPR tried to set up a paradox to question the range of true application of Quantum Mechanics: Quantum theory predicts that both values cannot be known for a particle, and yet the EPR thought experiment purports to show that they must all have determinate values. The EPR paper says: "We are thus forced to conclude that the quantum-mechanical description of physical reality given by wave functions is not complete."&lt;ref name=Kumar2011/&gt;

The EPR paper ends by saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;While we have thus shown that the wave function does not provide a complete description of the physical reality, we left open the question of whether or not such a description exists. We believe, however, that such a theory is possible.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Measurements on an entangled state ===
{{Main|Measurement in quantum mechanics}}
We have a source that emits electron–positron pairs, with the electron sent to destination ''A'', where there is an observer named [[Alice and Bob|Alice]], and the positron sent to destination ''B'', where there is an observer named [[Alice and Bob|Bob]]. According to quantum mechanics, we can arrange our source so that each emitted pair occupies a quantum state called a [[spin singlet]]. The particles are thus said to be [[quantum entanglement|entangled]]. This can be viewed as a [[quantum superposition]] of two states, which we call state I and state II. In state I, the electron has [[spin (physics)|spin]] pointing upward along the ''z''-axis (''+z'') and the positron has spin pointing downward along the ''z''-axis (−''z''). In state II, the electron has spin −''z'' and the positron has spin +''z''. Because it is in a superposition of states it is impossible without measuring to know the definite state of spin of either particle in the spin singlet.&lt;ref name=Griffiths2004&gt;{{citation| author=Griffiths, David J.|title=Introduction to Quantum Mechanics (2nd ed.) | publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2004 |isbn= 978-0-13-111892-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|421–422}}

[[Image:EPR illustration.svg|thumb|500px|center|The EPR thought experiment, performed with electron–positron pairs. A source (center) sends particles toward two observers, electrons to Alice (left) and positrons to Bob (right), who can perform spin measurements.]]

Alice now measures the spin along the ''z''-axis. She can obtain one of two possible outcomes: +''z'' or −''z''. Suppose she gets +''z''. According to the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, the quantum state of the system [[wavefunction collapse|collapses]] into state I. The quantum state determines the probable outcomes of any measurement performed on the system. In this case, if Bob subsequently measures spin along the ''z''-axis, there is 100% probability that he will obtain −''z''. Similarly, if Alice gets −''z'', Bob will get +''z''.

There is, of course, nothing special about choosing the ''z''-axis: according to quantum mechanics the spin singlet state may equally well be expressed as a superposition of spin states pointing in the ''x'' direction.&lt;ref name=Laloe&gt;{{citation|last=Laloe|first=Franck|title=Do We Really Understand Quantum Mechanics|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=69|issue=6|pages=655–701| publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012| isbn = 978-1-107-02501-1|arxiv=quant-ph/0209123|bibcode=2002quant.ph..9123L|doi=10.1119/1.1356698}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|318}} Suppose that Alice and Bob had decided to measure spin along the ''x''-axis. We'll call these states Ia and IIa. In state Ia, Alice's electron has spin +''x'' and Bob's positron has spin −''x''. In state IIa, Alice's electron has spin −''x'' and Bob's positron has spin +''x''. Therefore, if Alice measures +''x'', the system 'collapses' into state Ia, and Bob will get −''x''. If Alice measures −''x'', the system collapses into state IIa, and Bob will get +''x''.

Whatever axis their spins are measured along, they are always found to be opposite. This can only be explained if the particles are linked in some way. Either they were created with a definite (opposite) spin about every axis—a "hidden variable" argument—&lt;!-- Is it too obvious to point out that by using a spin singlet both particles by definition have opposite spin? --&gt;or they are linked so that one electron "feels" which axis the other is having its spin measured along, and becomes its opposite about that one axis—an "entanglement" argument. Moreover, if the two particles have their spins measured about ''different'' axes, once the electron's spin has been measured about the ''x''-axis (and the positron's spin about the ''x''-axis deduced), the positron's spin about the ''z''-axis will no longer be certain, as if (a) it knows that the measurement has taken place, or (b) it has a definite spin already, about a ''second'' axis—a hidden variable. However, it turns out that the predictions of Quantum Mechanics, which have been confirmed by experiment, cannot be explained by any local hidden variable theory. This is demonstrated in [[Bell's theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;George Greenstein and Arthur G. Zajonc, ''The Quantum Challenge'', p. "[Experiments in the early 1980s] have conclusively shown that quantum mechanics is indeed orrect, and that the EPR argument had relied upon incorrect assumptions."&lt;/ref&gt;

In quantum mechanics, the ''x''-spin and ''z''-spin are "incompatible observables", meaning the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] applies to alternating measurements of them: a quantum state cannot possess a definite value for both of these variables. Suppose Alice measures the ''z''-spin and obtains ''+z'', so that the quantum state collapses into state I. Now, instead of measuring the ''z''-spin as well, Bob measures the ''x''-spin. According to quantum mechanics, when the system is in state I, Bob's ''x''-spin measurement will have a 50% probability of producing +''x'' and a 50% probability of -''x''. It is impossible to predict which outcome will appear until Bob actually ''performs'' the measurement.

'''The paradox'''

One might imagine that, when Bob measures the ''x''-spin of his positron, he would get an answer with absolute certainty, since prior to this he hasn't disturbed his particle at all.  &lt;!-- Why would I imagine that? There seems to be no obvious link between the ''z''-axis and the ''x''-axis, hence no reason for the ''x''-axis to favour one direction over another. --&gt;   But it turns out that Bob's positron has a 50% probability of producing +''x'' and a 50% probability of −''x'', meaning the outcome is not certain. It's as if Bob's positron "knows" that Alice has measured the ''z''-spin of her electron, and hence his positron's own ''z''-spin must also be set, but its ''x''-spin remains uncertain.

Put another way, how does Bob's positron know which way to point if Alice decides (based on information unavailable to Bob) to measure x (i.e., to be the opposite of Alice's electron's spin about the ''x''-axis) and ''also'' how to point if Alice measures z, since it is only supposed to know one thing at a time?  &lt;!-- Is it too obvious to point out that in a spin singlet both particles have opposite spin? Therefore, Bob's particle will have the opposite ''x''-spin to Alice's. --&gt;    The Copenhagen interpretation rules that say the wave function "collapses" at the time of measurement, so there must be action at a distance (entanglement) or the positron must know more than it's supposed to know (hidden variables).  &lt;!-- To make the mixed part-quantum and part-classical descriptions of this experiment local, we have to say that the notebooks (and experimenters) are entangled and have linear combinations of + and – written in them, like [[Schrödinger's Cat]]. --&gt;

It is one thing to say that physical measurement of the first particle's momentum affects uncertainty in its ''own'' position, but to say that measuring the first particle's momentum affects the uncertainty in the position of the ''other'' is another thing altogether. Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen asked how can the second particle "know" to have precisely defined momentum but uncertain position? Since this implies that one particle is communicating with the other instantaneously across space, i.e., faster than light, this is the "paradox".

Incidentally, Bell used spin as his example, but many types of physical quantities—referred to as "observables" in quantum mechanics—can be used. The EPR paper used [[momentum]] for the observable. Experimental realisations of the EPR scenario often use [[photon polarization]], because polarized photons are easy to prepare and measure.

=== Locality in the EPR experiment ===
EPR describe the principle of locality as asserting that physical processes occurring at one place should have no immediate effect on the elements of reality at another location. At first sight, this appears to be a reasonable assumption to make, as it seems to be a consequence of [[special relativity]], which states that energy can never be transmitted faster than the [[speed of light]] without violating [[causality (physics)|causality]].&lt;ref name=Griffiths2004/&gt;{{rp|427–428}}&lt;ref name=Blaylock&gt;{{Cite journal

However, it turns out that the usual rules for combining quantum mechanical and classical descriptions violate EPR's principle of locality without violating special relativity or causality.&lt;ref name=Griffiths2004/&gt;{{rp|427–428}}&lt;ref name=Blaylock/&gt; Causality is preserved because there is no way for Alice to transmit messages (i.e., information) to Bob by manipulating her measurement axis. Whichever axis she uses, she has a 50% probability of obtaining "+" and 50% probability of obtaining "−", completely at [[randomness|random]]; according to quantum mechanics, it is fundamentally impossible for her to influence what result she gets. Furthermore, Bob is only able to perform his measurement ''once'': there is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics, the [[no cloning theorem]], which makes it impossible for him to make an arbitrary number of copies of the electron he receives, perform a spin measurement on each, and look at the statistical distribution of the results. Therefore, in the one measurement he is allowed to make, there is a 50% probability of getting "+" and 50% of getting "−", regardless of whether or not his axis is aligned with Alice's. 

Note that in this argument, we never assumed that energy could be transmitted faster than the speed of light. This shows that the results of the EPR experiment do not contradict the predictions of special relativity.

However, the principle of locality appeals powerfully to physical intuition, and Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen were unwilling to abandon it. Einstein derided the quantum mechanical predictions as "[[action at a distance (physics)|spooky action at a distance]]". The (incorrect) conclusion they drew was that quantum mechanics is not a complete theory.&lt;ref name=Bell1981&gt;{{cite journal

The word [[principle of locality|locality]] has several different meanings in physics. For example, in [[quantum field theory]] "locality" means that quantum fields at different points of space do not interact with one another. However, quantum field theories that are "local" in this sense ''appear'' to violate the [[principle of locality]] as defined by EPR, but they nevertheless do not violate locality in a more general sense.  [[Wavefunction collapse]] can be viewed as an epiphenomenon of [[quantum decoherence]], which in turn is nothing more than an effect of the underlying local time evolution of the wavefunction of a system and ''all'' of its environment.  Since the ''underlying'' behaviour doesn't violate causality or special relativity, it follows that neither does the additional effect of wavefunction collapse, whether real ''or'' apparent.  Therefore, as mentioned above, neither the EPR experiment nor any quantum experiment demonstrates that superluminous signaling is possible.

== Resolving the paradox ==

=== Hidden variables ===
{{main|Hidden-variable theory}}
There are several ways to resolve the EPR paradox. The one suggested by EPR is that quantum mechanics, despite its success in a wide variety of experimental scenarios, is actually an incomplete theory. In other words, there is some yet undiscovered theory of nature to which quantum mechanics acts as a kind of statistical approximation (albeit an exceedingly successful one). Unlike quantum mechanics, the more complete theory contains variables corresponding to all the "elements of reality". There must be some unknown mechanism acting on these variables to give rise to the observed effects of "non-commuting quantum observables", i.e., the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]. Such a theory is called a [[hidden variable theory]].&lt;ref name=Kumar2011/&gt;{{rp|334}}&lt;ref name="WheelerZurek2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Archibald Wheeler|author2=Wojciech Hubert Zurek|title=Quantum Theory and Measurement|date=14 July 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5455-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|357–358}}

To illustrate this idea, we can formulate a very simple hidden variable theory for the above thought experiment. One supposes that the quantum spin-singlet states emitted by the source are actually approximate descriptions for "true" physical states possessing definite values for the ''z''-spin and ''x''-spin. In these "true" states, the positron going to Bob always has spin values opposite to the electron going to Alice, but the values are otherwise completely random. For example, the first pair emitted by the source might be "(+''z'', −''x'') to Alice and (−''z'', +''x'') to Bob", the next pair "(−''z'', −''x'') to Alice and (+''z'', +''x'') to Bob", and so forth. Therefore, if Bob's measurement axis is aligned with Alice's, he will necessarily get the opposite of whatever Alice gets; otherwise, he will get "+" and "−" with equal probability.&lt;ref name=Sakurai&gt;{{Citation  | last1 = Sakurai  | first1 = J. J.  |last2 = Napolitano  | first2 = Jim  | title = Modern Quantum Mechanics  | edition = 2nd  | publisher = Addison-Wesley  | year = 2010|isbn =978-0805382914  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|239–240}}

Assuming we restrict our measurements to the ''z''- and ''x''-axes, such a hidden variable theory is experimentally indistinguishable from quantum mechanics. In reality, there may be an infinite number of axes along which Alice and Bob can perform their measurements, so there would have to be an infinite number of independent hidden variables. However, this is not a serious problem; we have formulated a very simplistic hidden variable theory, and a more sophisticated theory might be able to patch it up. It turns out that there is a much more serious challenge to the idea of hidden variables.

==== Bell's inequality ====
{{Main article|Bell's theorem}}
In 1964, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] showed that the predictions of quantum mechanics in the EPR thought experiment are significantly different from the predictions of a particular class of hidden variable theories (the ''local'' hidden variable theories). Roughly speaking, quantum mechanics has a much stronger statistical [[correlation]] with measurement results performed on different axes than do these hidden variable theories. These differences, expressed using [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality relations]] known as "Bell's inequalities", are in principle experimentally detectable. After the publication of Bell's paper, a variety of experiments to test Bell's inequalities were devised. These generally relied on measurement of [[photon polarization]]. All experiments conducted to date have found behavior in line with the predictions of standard quantum mechanics theory.

Later work by [[Henry Stapp]] showed that a key property of local hidden variable theories which lead to Bell's inequalities was [[counterfactual definiteness]]. Building on Stapp's observations, P.H. Eberhard showed that any local counterfactual model results in Bell's inequality even without the assumption of there being hidden variables unknown to physics upon which the relevant observables depend. [[Arthur Fine]] subsequently showed that any theory satisfying the inequalities can be modeled by a local hidden variable theory. (Although Eberhard referred to his result as "Bell's theorem without hidden variables", Fine used a more general definition of "hidden variables" that includes the possibility of the observables being elementary.) Fine went on to show that any stochastic factorizable model leads to Bell's inequality. Itamar Pitowsky showed that Bell's inequality was a special case of an inequality discovered by George Boole which provides a consistency check on whether data can be represented by variables on a single classical probability space. He interpreted this to be an indication that the locality assumption prevented the data from being represented as events on such a space.&lt;ref name="Pitowsky1989"&gt;{{cite book | last=Pitowsky | first=Itamar | title=Bell's Theorem, Quantum Theory and Conceptions of the Universe | chapter=From George Boole To John Bell — The Origins of Bell’s Inequality | publisher=Springer Netherlands | location=Dordrecht | year=1989 | isbn=978-90-481-4058-9 | doi=10.1007/978-94-017-0849-4_6 | pages=37–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Eberhard's proof made use of both locality and counterfactual definiteness it was assumed that an interpretation could reject either one of these to escape Bell's inequality. Violation of locality is difficult to reconcile with [[special relativity]], and is thought to be incompatible with the principle of causality, nevertheless there was renewed interest in the [[Bohm interpretation]] of quantum mechanics which keeps counterfactual definiteness while introducing a conjectured non-local mechanism in the form of the '[[quantum potential]]' that is defined as one of the terms of the Schrödinger equation. Mainstream physics preferred to keep locality and reject counterfactual definiteness. Fine's work showed that, taking locality as a given, there exist scenarios in which two statistical variables are correlated in a manner inconsistent with counterfactual definiteness, and that such scenarios are no more mysterious than any other, despite the fact that the inconsistency with counterfactual definiteness may seem counterintuitive.

Further insights resulted from the work of Lawrence J. Landau. Landau showed that if it is assumed that there is a single classical probability space underlying all the observables under consideration in the EPR experiment, Bell's inequality will result.&lt;ref name=landau87&gt;{{cite journal |first=L. J.|last=Landau|title=On the violation of Bell's inequality in quantum theory|journal=[[Physics Letters]]|volume=120|issue=2|pages=4–6|year=1987|doi=10.1016/0375-9601(87)90075-2|bibcode=1987PhLA..120...54L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the fundamental issue is that Quantum mechanical probabilities cannot be modeled using classical (Kolmogorovian) probability regardless of whether Quantum Mechanics is considered a complete description of reality or not. Regarding Landau's proof [[Ray Streater]] notes that it shows that Bohmian mechanics is inconsistent with Quantum mechanics and succumbs to Bell's inequality despite claims to the contrary by its proponents. Streater notes that Landau's proof only requires the assumption of a single classical probability space (a condition still satisfied by Bohm's theory) and the fact that Bohmian mechanics additionally postulates the existence of a non-local mechanism, cannot prevent Bell's inequality from applying to it.&lt;ref name="streater2007lost"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Streater, R.F.|title=Lost Causes in and beyond Physics|date=2017|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783540365822}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|99–102}}

Similar observations have been made by Karl Hess, Walter, Philipp, Hans de Raedt and Kristel Michielsen, who note that in Bell's proof, Bell's assumption of a space of hidden variables behaving as a classical probability space is sufficient to produce a contradiction with the predications of Quantum mechanics via a consistency theorem of N. N. Vorob'ev, a statistician who had built on the same work of Boole used by Pitowsky. The additional assumption of locality used by Bell is redundant and indeed Fine's work had included a derivation of Bell's inequality that did not require the assumption of locality .&lt;ref name="Hess2005"&gt;{{cite conference | last=Hess | first=Karl | title=Bell’s theorem: Critique of proofs with and without inequalities | publisher=AIP | year=2005 | issn=0094-243X | doi=10.1063/1.1874568 | pages=150–157| arxiv=quant-ph/0410015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Bell's theorem does not apply to all possible [[philosophical realism|philosophically realist]] theories. It is a common misconception that quantum mechanics is inconsistent with all notions of philosophical realism. Realist interpretations of quantum mechanics are possible, although as discussed above, such interpretations must reject counterfactual definiteness. Examples of such realist interpretations are the [[consistent histories]] interpretation and the [[transactional interpretation]] (first proposed by [[John G. Cramer]] in 1986). Griffiths notes that it is not "local realism" that is ruled out by quantum mechanics but "classical realism".&lt;ref name="Griffiths"/&gt;  Some workers in the field have also attempted to formulate hidden variable theories that exploit [[Loopholes in Bell test experiments|loopholes in actual experiments]], such as the assumptions made in interpreting experimental data, although no theory has been proposed that can reproduce all the results of quantum mechanics.

Alternatives are still possible. A recent review article based on the [[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory|Wheeler–Feynman time-symmetric theory]] rewrites the entire theory in terms of retarded [[Liénard–Wiechert potential]]s only, which becomes manifestly causal, and, establishes a conservation law for total generalized momenta held instantaneously for any closed system.&lt;ref name=scott15&gt;{{cite journal |first=T. C. |last=Scott |first2=D. |last2=Andrae |title=Quantum Nonlocality and Conservation of momentum|journal=[[Physics Essays|Phys.

There are also individual EPR-like experiments that have no local hidden variables explanation. Examples have been suggested by [[David Bohm]] and by [[Lucien Hardy]].

===Einstein's hope for a purely algebraic theory===
The [[Bohm interpretation]] of quantum mechanics hypothesizes that the state of the universe evolves smoothly through time with no collapsing of quantum wavefunctions. One problem for the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is to precisely define wavefunction collapse. Einstein maintained that quantum mechanics is physically incomplete and logically unsatisfactory. In "The Meaning of Relativity", Einstein wrote, "One can give good reasons why reality cannot at all be represented by a continuous field. From the quantum phenomena it appears to follow with certainty that a finite system of finite energy can be completely described by a finite set of numbers (quantum numbers). This does not seem to be in accordance with a continuum theory and must lead to an attempt to find a purely [[Local quantum field theory|algebraic theory]] for the representation of reality. But nobody knows how to find the basis for such a theory."
If time, space, and energy are secondary features derived from a substrate below the [[Planck scale]], then Einstein's hypothetical algebraic system might resolve the EPR paradox (although Bell's theorem would still be valid). If physical reality is totally finite, then the Copenhagen interpretation might be an approximation to an information processing system below the Planck scale.

==="Acceptable theories" and the experiment===
According to the present view of the situation, quantum mechanics flatly contradicts Einstein's philosophical postulate that any acceptable physical theory must fulfill  "local realism".

In the EPR paper (1935), the authors realised that quantum mechanics was inconsistent with their assumptions, but Einstein nevertheless thought that quantum mechanics might simply be augmented by hidden variables (i.e., variables which were, at that point, still obscure to him), without any other change, to achieve an acceptable theory. He pursued these ideas for over twenty years until the end of his life, in 1955.

In contrast, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]], in his 1964 paper, showed that quantum mechanics and the class of hidden variable theories Einstein favored&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Clearing up mysteries: the original goal | url = http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmystery.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; would lead to different experimental results: different by a factor of {{sfrac|3|2}} for certain correlations. So the issue of "acceptability", up to that time mainly concerning theory, finally became experimentally decidable.

There are many [[Bell test experiments]], e.g., those of [[Alain Aspect]] and others. They support the predictions of quantum mechanics rather than the class of hidden variable theories supported by Einstein.&lt;ref name=Aspect1999/&gt;

=== Implications for quantum mechanics ===
Most physicists today believe that quantum mechanics is correct, and that the EPR paradox is a "paradox" only because classical intuitions do not correspond to physical reality. How EPR is interpreted regarding locality depends on the [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation of quantum mechanics]] one uses.  In the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], it is usually understood that instantaneous [[wave function collapse]] does occur.  However, the view that there is no ''causal'' instantaneous effect has also been proposed within the Copenhagen interpretation: in this alternative view, measurement affects our ability to define (and measure) quantities in the physical system, not the system itself. In the [[many-worlds interpretation]], locality is strictly preserved, since the effects of operations such as measurement affect only the state of the particle that is measured.&lt;ref name=Blaylock/&gt;  However, the results of the measurement are not unique—every possible result is obtained.

The EPR paradox has deepened our understanding of quantum mechanics by exposing the fundamentally non-classical characteristics of the [[measurement (quantum mechanics)|measurement]] process. Before the publication of the EPR paper, a measurement was often visualized as a physical disturbance that had to be inflicted ''directly'' upon the measured subsystem. For instance, when measuring the position of an electron, one imagines shining a light on it, thus disturbing the electron and producing the quantum mechanical uncertainties in its position. Such pat and convenient but unhelpful explanations of quantum mechanics remain commonplace today,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Furuta|first1=Aya|title=One Thing Is Certain: Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle Is Not Dead|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/heisenbergs-uncertainty-principle-is-not-dead/|accessdate=16 January 2017|work=Scientific American|quote=Yet the uncertainty principle comes in two superficially similar formulations that even many practicing physicists tend to confuse.

In fact, [[Yakir Aharonov]] and his collaborators have developed a whole theory of so-called [[Weak measurement]].&lt;ref name=Laloe/&gt;{{rp|181–184}}

Technologies relying on quantum entanglement are now being developed. In [[quantum cryptography]], entangled particles are used to transmit signals that cannot be [[Eavesdropping|eavesdropped]] upon without leaving a trace. In [[quantum computation]], entangled quantum states are used to perform computations in [[parallel computing|parallel]], which may allow certain calculations to be performed much more quickly than they ever could be with classical computers.&lt;ref name=Haroche&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Haroche | first1 =Serge | last2 =Raimond | first2 =Jean-Michel | title =Exploring the Quantum: Atoms, Cavities, and Photons | publisher =Oxford University Press | edition =1st  | date =2006 | isbn =978-0198509141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|83–100}}

== Mathematical formulation ==
The above discussion can be expressed mathematically using the [[spin (physics)|quantum mechanical formulation of spin]]. The spin degree of freedom for an electron is associated with a two-dimensional complex [[vector space]] ''V'', with each quantum state corresponding to a vector in that space. The operators corresponding to the spin along the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' direction, denoted ''S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''S&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' respectively, can be represented using the [[Pauli matrices]]:&lt;ref name=Sakurai /&gt;{{rp|9}}

:&lt;math&gt;
  S_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp;  1 \\ 1 &amp;  0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
  S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -i \\ i &amp;  0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
  S_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;  0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Planck constant]] (or the Planck constant divided by 2π).

The [[eigenstate]]s of ''S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' are represented as

:&lt;math&gt;
  \left|+z\right\rangle \leftrightarrow \begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}, \quad
  \left|-z\right\rangle \leftrightarrow \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the eigenstates of ''S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' are represented as

:&lt;math&gt;
  \left|+x\right\rangle \leftrightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}, \quad
  \left|-x\right\rangle \leftrightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix}1\\-1\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The vector space of the electron-positron pair is &lt;math&gt; V \otimes V &lt;/math&gt;, the [[tensor product]] of the electron's and positron's vector spaces. The spin singlet state is

:&lt;math&gt;
  \left|\psi\right\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \bigg (
    \left|+z\right\rangle \otimes \left|-z\right\rangle -
    \left|-z\right\rangle \otimes \left|+z\right\rang
  \bigg)
&lt;/math&gt;

where the two terms on the right hand side are what we have referred to as state I and state II above.

From the above equations, it can be shown that the spin singlet can also be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
  \left|\psi\right\rangle = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \bigg(
    \left|+x\right\rangle \otimes \left|-x\right\rangle -
    \left|-x\right\rangle \otimes \left|+x\right\rangle
  \bigg)
&lt;/math&gt;

where the terms on the right hand side are what we have referred to as state Ia and state IIa.

To illustrate how this leads to the violation of local realism, we need to show that after Alice's measurement of ''S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' (or ''S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''), Bob's value of ''S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' (or ''S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'') is uniquely determined, and therefore corresponds to an "element of physical reality". This follows from the principles of [[measurement in quantum mechanics]]. When ''S''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; is measured, the system state ψ collapses into an eigenvector of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;.  If the measurement result is ''+z'', this means that immediately after measurement the system state undergoes an orthogonal projection of ψ onto the
space of states of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \left| +z \right\rangle \otimes \left| \phi\right\rangle \quad \phi \in V &lt;/math&gt;

For the spin singlet, the new state is

:&lt;math&gt; \left| +z \right\rangle \otimes \left| -z \right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, if Alice's measurement result is −''z'', the system undergoes an orthogonal projection onto

:&lt;math&gt; \left| -z \right\rangle \otimes \left| \phi\right\rangle \quad \phi \in V &lt;/math&gt;

which means that the new state is

:&lt;math&gt; \left|-z\right\rangle \otimes \left|+z\right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

This implies that the measurement for ''S''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; for Bob's positron is now determined.  It will be −''z'' in the first case or +''z'' in the second case.

It remains only to show that ''S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' cannot simultaneously possess definite values in quantum mechanics. One may show in a straightforward manner that no possible vector can be an [[eigenvector]] of both matrices. More generally, one may use the fact that the operators do not [[commutation relation|commute]],

:&lt;math&gt;\left[S_x, S_z\right] = -i\hbar S_y \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;

along with the Heisenberg uncertainty relation

:&lt;math&gt;
 \left\langle {\Delta S_x}^2 \right\rangle \left\langle {\Delta S_z}^2 \right\rangle \ge
   \frac{1}{4} \left|\left\langle \left[S_x, S_z\right] \right\rang\right|^2
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!-- Yet, for the given state, $\langle\left[S_x,S_z\right]\rangle=−i\hbar\langle S_y\rangle=0$ and thus this relation will always be fulfilled!     --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1417">'''Epistemic commitment''' is an obligation, which may be withdrawn only under appropriate circumstances, to uphold the factual truth of a given [[proposition]], and to provide reasons for one's [[belief]] in that proposition.
Epistemic means 'of, or relating to knowledge'. An epistemic commitment of some kind, on the part of the participants, underlies most [[argument]]s. For instance, each participant in an argument would have a position that they are expressing, and an underlying epistemic commitment fundamental to their reasoning.

==Example==
Joe states that [[whale]]s are gentle creatures, and as such, should never be killed.

Susan replies that [[killer whale]]s are not 'gentle', in fact, they eat [[pinniped|seal pups]].

Joe, instead of revising his earlier stated opinion of whales based on new information from Susan, asserts that killer whales must not actually be whales, because a 'true whale eats plankton.' Joe has now redefined 'whale' to suit his argument.

If Susan shows Joe a [[biology]] textbook which asserts that killer whales are, in fact whales, then Joe might (or might not) decide to withdraw his epistemic commitment to the original statement about whales.

The '''European social model''' is a common vision many European states have for a society that combines economic growth with high [[living standard]]s and good [[working conditions]]. Historian [[Tony Judt]] has argued that the European social model "binds Europe together" in contrast to the '[[American way of life]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/17/politics1|title=The Guardian|last=Laity|first=Paul|date=17 May 2008|work=Uncomfortable truths. Interview with Tony Judt.|accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European states do not all use a single [[social model]], but [[welfare state]]s in Europe do share several broad characteristics. These generally include a commitment to [[full employment]], [[social protection]]s for all citizens, [[social inclusion]], and democracy. Examples common among European countries include [[universal health care]], free higher education, strong labor protections and regulations, and generous welfare programs in areas such as unemployment insurance, retirement pensions, and public housing. The [[Treaties of Rome|Treaty of the European Community]] set out several social objectives: "promotion of employment, improved living and working conditions ... proper social protection, dialogue between management and labour, the development of human resources with a view to lasting high employment and the combating of exclusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etuc.org/a/2771|title=The European Social Model|date=21 March 2007|publisher=European Trade Union Confederation|accessdate=4 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109165943/http://www.etuc.org/a/2771|archive-date=9 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because different European states focus on different aspects of the model, it has been argued that there are four distinct social models in Europe: the Nordic, British, Mediterranean and the Continental.&lt;ref&gt;Sapir, André. 2005.

New York: Oxford University Press (USA).&lt;/ref&gt;

The general outlines of a European social model emerged during the [[Post-World War II economic expansion|post-war boom]]. [[Tony Judt]] lists a number of causes: the abandonment of [[protectionism]], the [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]], cheap energy, and a desire to catch up with [[living standards]] enjoyed in the United States. The European social model also enjoyed a low degree of external competition as the Soviet bloc, China and India were not yet integrated into the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12767280&amp;source=login_payBarrier|title=The Economist|last=Charlemagne|date=11 December 2008|work=The left's resignation note|accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, it has become common to question whether the European social model is sustainable in the face of low birthrates, [[globalisation]], [[Europeanisation]] and an [[Ageing of Europe|ageing population]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/933|title=Europe's Ailing Social Model: Facts &amp; Fairy-Tales|author=Martin De Vlieghere|author2=Paul Vreymans|last-author-amp=yes|date=23 March 2006|work=The Brussels Journal|accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bof.fi/en/suomen_pankki/ajankohtaista/puheet/2007/EL_puhe27112007.htm|title=Remarks by Governor Liikanen: "A European Social Model: an Asset or a Liability?"|date=27 November 2007|publisher=The World Political Forum|accessdate=3 January 2010|location=Budapest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Welfare state in Europe==
[[Image:Social Expenditures in the EU.jpg|thumb|right|400px]]
Some of the European welfare states have been described as the most well developed and extensive.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/cre/publish/pdfs/wp61a.pdf article]&lt;/ref&gt; A unique "European social model" is described in contrast with the social model existing in the US.

===Nordic model===
{{see also|Nordic model}}
As can be seen in the graph to the right, the Nordic model holds the highest level of [[social insurance]]. Its main characteristic is its universal provision nature which is based on the principle of "citizenship". Therefore, there exists a more generalised access, with lower conditionability, to the social provisions.

As regards labour market, these countries are characterised by important expenditures in [[active labour market policies]] whose aim is a rapid reinsertion of the [[unemployment|unemployed]] into the labour market. These countries are also characterised by a high share of [[public employment]]. Trade unions have a high membership and an important decision-making power which induces a low wage dispersion or more equitable income distribution.

The Nordic model is also characterised by a high [[tax wedge]].

===Continental model===
{{see also|Rhine capitalism}}
The Continental model has some similarities with the Nordic model. Nevertheless, it has a higher share of its expenditures devoted to pensions. The model is based on the principle of "security" and a system of subsidies which are not conditioned to employability (for example in the case of France or Belgium, there exist subsidies whose only requirement is being older than 25).

As regards the labour market, active policies are less important than in the Nordic model and in spite of a low membership rate, trade-unions have important decision-making powers in [[collective agreement]]s.

Another important aspect of the Continental model is the [[disability pension]]s.

===Anglo-Saxon model===
{{main|Anglo-Saxon economy}}
The Anglo-Saxon model features a lower level of expenditures than the previous ones. Its main particularity is its [[social assistance]] of last resort. Subsidies are directed to a higher extent to the working-age population and to a lower extent to pensions. Access to subsidies is (more) conditioned to employability (for instance, they are conditioned on having worked previously).

Active labour market policies are important. Instead, trade unions have smaller decision-making powers than in the previous models, this is one of the reasons explaining their higher income dispersion and their higher number of low-wage employments.

===Mediterranean model===&lt;!-- "Mediterranean model" redirects here --&gt;
The '''Mediterranean model'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; corresponds to southern European countries who developed their [[welfare state]] later than the previous ones (during the 1970s and 1980s). It is the model with the lowest share of expenditures and is strongly based on pensions and a low level of social assistance. There exists in these countries a higher segmentation of rights and status of persons receiving subsidies which has as one of its consequences a strongly conditioned access to social provisions.

The main characteristic of labour market policies is a rigid [[employment protection legislation]] and a frequent resort to [[early retirement]] policies as a means to improve employment conditions. Trade unions tend to have an important membership which again is one of the explanations behind a lower income dispersion than in the Anglo-Saxon model.

==Evaluating the different social models==
[[Image:Reducción en la pobreza de los Modelos Sociales Europeos.png|thumb|350px|Reduction in poverty by the different European social models. Reduction in [[Gini index]] after transfers and taxes (in percentage change).]]
[[Image:Eficiencia Gastos Sociales.jpg|thumb|350px|Efficiency of social expenditures in the four European social models]]

To evaluate the different social models, we follow the criteria used in Boeri (2002) and Sapir (2005) which consider that a social model should satisfy the following:
# Reduction in poverty. 
# Protection against labour market risks. 
# Rewards for labour participation.

===Reduction in poverty===
The graph on the right shows the reduction in inequality (as measured by the [[Gini index]]) after taking account of taxes and transfers, that is, to which extent does each social model reduce poverty without taking into account the reduction in poverty provoqued by taxes and transfers. The level of social expenditures is an indicator of the capacity of each model to reduce poverty: a bigger share of expenditures is in general associated to a higher reduction in poverty. Nevertheless, another aspect that should be taken into account is the efficiency in this poverty reduction. By this is meant that with a lower share of expenditures a higher reduction in poverty may be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Sergiusz| last = Prokurat|title =European Social Model and East Asian Economic Model – different approach to productivity and competition in economy|publisher= Asia – Europe. Partnership or Rivalry?”|date= 2010|accessdate=4 August 2016|location= Wrocław|pages= 35–47|url= http://www.proeconomics.pl/artykuly/ESMandEAEM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, the graph on the right shows that the Anglosaxon and Nordic models are more efficient than the Continental or Mediterranean ones. The Continental model appears to be the least efficient. Given its high level of social expenditures, one would expect a higher poverty reduction than that attained by this model. Remark how the Anglosaxon model is found above the average line drawn whereas the Continental is found below that line.

===Protection against labour market risks===
[[Image:Relación entre protección al empleo y % trabajadores con beneficios desempleo.jpg|thumb|350px|As can be seen, there exists a negative relationship between [[employment protection legislation]] and the share of workers receiving [[unemployment benefits]].]]

Protection against labour market risks is generally assured by two means: 
# Regulation of the labour market by means of employment protection legislation which basically increases firing costs and [[severance payments]] for the employers. This is generally referred to as providing "employment" protection.
# [[Unemployment benefit]]s which are commonly financed with taxes or [[mandatory public insurance]]s to the employees and employers. This is generally referred to as providing protection to the "worker" as opposed to "employment".

As can be seen in the graph, there is a clear trade-off between these two types of labour market instruments (remark the clear negative slope between both). Once again different European countries have chosen a different position in their use of these two mechanisms of labour market protection. These differences can be summarised as follows: 
* The Mediterranean countries have chosen a higher "employment" protection while a very low share of their unemployed workers receives unemployment benefits. 
* The Nordic countries have chosen to protect to a lesser extent "employment" and instead, an important share of their unemployed workers receives benefits. 
* The continental countries have a higher level of both mechanisms than the European average, although by a small margin. 
* The Anglo-Saxon countries base their protection on unemployment benefits and a low level of employment protection.

Evaluating the different choices is a hard task. In general there exists consensus among economists on the fact that employment protection generates inefficiencies inside firms. Instead, there is no such consensus as regards the question of whether employment protection generates a higher level of unemployment.

===Rewards for labour participation===
[[Image:Ratio Empleo-Población.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Employment rate|Employment]] and [[Unemployment rate|unemployment]] rates for each social model]]
Sapir (2005) and Boeri (2002) propose looking at the [[employment-to-population ratio]] as the best way to analyse the incentives and rewards for employment in each social model. The [[Lisbon Strategy]] initiated in 2001 established that the members of the EU should attain a 70% employment rate by 2010.

In this case, the graph shows that the countries in the Nordic and Anglosaxon model are the ones with the highest employment rate whereas the Continental and Mediterranean countries have not attained the Lisbon Strategy target.

===Conclusion===
[[Image:Tipologia de los distintos modelos sociales europeos.png|thumb|400px|Classifying the different social models according to their [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] and [[Equity (economics)|equity]]. Elevada means high whereas Baja means low.]]
Sapir (2005) proposes as a general mean to evaluate the different social models, the following two criteria: 
# [[Economic efficiency|Efficiency]], that is, whether the model provides the incentives so as to achieve the largest number possible of employed persons, that is, the highest [[employment rate]]. 
# Equity, that is, whether the social model achieves a relatively low poverty risk.

As can be seen in the graph, according to these two criteria, the best performance is achieved by the Nordic model. The Continental model should improve its efficiency whereas the Anglosaxon model its equity. The Mediterranean model under-performs in both criteria.

Some economists consider that between the Continental model and the Anglo-Saxon, the latter should be preferred given its better results in employment, which make it more sustainable in the long term, whereas the equity level depends on the preferences of each country (Sapir, 2005). Other economists argue that the Continental model cannot be considered worse than the Anglosaxon given that it is also the result of the preferences of those countries that support it (Fitoussi et al., 2000; Blanchard, 2004). This last argument can be used to justify any policy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8743">The '''Feldman–Mahalanobis model''' is a [[Neo-Marxian economics|Neo-Marxian]] model of [[development economics|economic development]], created independently by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] economist [[Grigory Feldman]] in 1928,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feldman |first=G. A. |origyear=1928 |year=1964 |chapter=On the Theory of Growth Rates of National Income |editor-first=N. |editor-last=Spulber |title=Foundations of Soviet Strategy for Economic Growth |location=Bloomington |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rPkrAAAAMAAJ }} (Translated version)&lt;/ref&gt; and Indian [[statistician]] [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mahalanobis |first=P. |year=1953 |title=Some observations  on the Process of Growth of National Income |location=Sankhya |pages=307–312 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahalanobis became essentially the key economist of [[India]]'s [[Five-year plans of India|Second Five Year Plan]], becoming subject to much of India's most dramatic economic debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bronfenbrenner |first=M. |authorlink=Martin Bronfenbrenner |title=A Simplified Mahalanobis Development Model |journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=45–51 |year=1960 |jstor=1151921 |doi=10.1086/449867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essence of the model is a shift in the pattern of industrial [[investment]] towards building up a [[domestic policy|domestic]] [[consumption goods]] sector. Thus the [[strategy]] suggests in order to reach a high standard in consumption, investment in building a [[Capacity utilization|capacity]] in the [[Production (economics)|production]] of capital goods is firstly needed. A high enough capacity in the capital goods sector in the long-run expands the capacity in the production of consumer goods. The distinction between the two different types of goods was a clearer formulation of [[Karl Marx|Marx’s]] ideas in ''[[Das Kapital]]'', and also helped people to better understand the extent of the trade off between the levels of immediate and future consumption. These ideas were however first introduced in 1928 by Feldman, an economist working for the [[GOSPLAN]] planning commission; presenting theoretical arguments of a two-department scheme of growth. There is no evidence that Mahalanobis knew of Feldman’s approach, being kept behind the borders of the USSR.

==Implementation of the model==
The model was created as an analytical framework for India’s Second Five Year Plan in 1955 by appointment of Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], as India felt there was a need to introduce a formal plan model after the First Five Year Plan (1951–1956). The First Five Year Plan stressed investment for capital accumulation in the spirit of the one-sector [[Harrod–Domar model]]. It argued that production required capital and that capital can be accumulated through investment; the faster one accumulates, the higher the growth rate will be. The most fundamental criticisms came from Mahalanobis, who himself was working with a variant of it in 1951 and 1952. The criticisms were mostly around the model’s inability to cope with the real constraints of the economy; it’s ignoring of the fundamental choice problems of planning over time; and the lack of connection between the model and the actual selection of projects for governmental expenditure. Subsequently Mahalanobis introduced his celebrated two-sector model, which he later expanded into a four-sector version.

==Assumptions==
The assumptions under which the Mahalanobis model holds true are as follow:

*We assume a [[autarky|closed economy]].
*The [[economy]] consists of two sectors: consumption goods sector C and capital goods sector K.
*Capital goods are ''non-shiftable''.
*Full capacity production.
*Investment is determined by supply of capital goods.
*No changes in prices.
*Capital is the only scarce factor.
*Production of capital goods is independent of the production of consumer goods.

==Basics of the model==
The full capacity output equation is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Subrata |last=Ghatak |year=2003 |title=Introduction to Development Economics |location=London |publisher=Routledge |edition=4th |page=349 |isbn=0-415-09722-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
Y_{t} = Y_{0} \left \lbrace 1 + \alpha_{0} \frac{\lambda_{k}\beta_{k} + \lambda_{c}\beta_{c}}{\lambda_{k}\beta_{k}} \left \lbrack (1 + \lambda_{k}\beta_{k})^t - 1 \right \rbrack \right \rbrace
&lt;/math&gt;

In the model the growth rate is given by both the share of investment in the capital goods sector, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{k}&lt;/math&gt;, and the share of investment in the consumer goods sector, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{c}&lt;/math&gt;. If we choose to increase the value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{k}&lt;/math&gt; to be larger than &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{c}&lt;/math&gt;, this will initially result in a slower growth in the short-run, but in the long run will exceed the former growth rate choice with a higher growth rate and an ultimately higher level of consumption. In other words, if this method is used, only in the long run will investment into the capital goods produce consumer goods, resulting in no short run gains.

==Criticisms==
One of the most common criticisms of the model is that Mahalanobis pays hardly any attention to the savings constraint, which he assumes comes from the [[industrial sector]]. Developing countries however do not have this tendency, as the first stages of saving usually come from the [[agriculture|agricultural sector]]. He also does not mention [[taxation]], an important potential source of capital.
A more serious criticism is the limitation of the assumptions under which this model holds, an example being the limitation of [[foreign trade]]. This cannot be justifiable to [[developing countries]] today. Also another criticism is that a country to use this model would have to be large enough to contain all the raw resources needed to be sustainable, so therefore this would not apply to smaller countries.

==Empirical case==
Essentially the model was put into practice in 1956 as the theoretical pathway of India's Second Five Year Plan. However, after two years the first problems started to emerge. Problems such as unexpected and unavoidable costs contributed to increased [[money supply]] and growing [[inflation]]. The biggest problem was the fall in the [[foreign exchange reserve]] due to liberalised [[import]] [[policy]] and international tension, leading to modifications in the Second Plan in 1958. It was finally abandoned and replaced by the Third Five Year Plan in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sen |first=Pronab |title=Growth Theories and Development Strategies: Lessons from Indian Experience |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=26 |issue=30 |year=1991 |pages=PE62–PE72 |jstor=41498498 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Film censorship''' is carried out by various countries to differing degrees, sometimes as a result of powerful or relentless lobbying by organizations or individuals. Films that are banned in a particular country change over time.

==Rating systems==
A [[motion picture rating system]] is designated to classify films with regard to suitability for audiences in terms of issues such as sex, violence, substance abuse, profanity, impudence or other types of obscene content. A particular issued rating can be called a certification, classification, certificate.

==By country==
{{See also|List of banned films}}

===Australia===

Australia's [[Australian Classification Board]] (ACB), formerly known as the Office of Film and Literature Classification  (OFLC), uses the Commonwealth Classification Act 1995 as a guide for the majority of the censorship within the country; however, each state and territory is free to make additional legislation (see [[Censorship in Australia]]). Australia is regarded by many to be the most restrictive on film ratings of all Western democratic countries, considering its history and prolific "refusal of classification" (tantamount to banning in other countries) to certain films, although restrictions have eased over the years.

In practice, films still get a short cinematic run before they are reviewed and prevented from being shown at cinemas or released on DVD. This is not a comprehensive list; many films that have been previously banned are not mentioned here (however, some have since been released uncut on DVD). Also not included are the numerous pornographic films deemed too excessive to release under an X18+ category, which are refused classification by the ACB.

===Brazil===
;During dictatorship (1964–1988)
During the dictatorship in Brazil, that last from 1964 to 1988, several films were banned under the Federal Law from Brazil 5536 from 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexml.gov.br/urn/urn:lex:br:federal:lei:1968-11-21;5536 |title=Lei nº 5.536, de 21 de Novembro de 1968 - 5536/68 :: Legislação::Lei 5536/1968 (Federal - Brasil) :: |publisher=Lexml.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During several years a project was being developed to find and publish every document on censorship in films during the dictatorship.
The project "Memory of Censorship in Brazilian Cinema" released in 2005 six thousand documents about 175 banned films during the dictatorship. And, finally, in 2007 they released documents for the last 269 films banned at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memoriacinebr.com.br/projeto.asp |title=:.

* 1976: ''Di Cavalcanti'':

This film (short) about Di Cavalcanti was banned due a lawsuit open by Di Cavalcanti daughter, Elizabeth, in 1979. The film documented the wake and funeral of the Brazilian painter Di Cavalcanti. Since 1979 it can not be shown, at the request of his daughter Elizabeth through preliminary injunction granted by Justice, confirmed in 1983, for sentimental reasons tied with religious ideas. In 1985, the lawyer Felipe Falcon moved an action to reform the judgment, by proposing the dispossession of the film by the state on cultural grounds, to the detriment of the heirs of Di and Glauber. Yet with no solution in sight, Di Glauber must stay contained in a sealed box. 2004: In spite of everything, João Rocha ( director of Thuth Profane),nephew of the Glauber Rocha, has placed a copy on video on providers outside of Brazil: the internet users can make free downloads of the movie, proving that censor the cinema in digital age is useless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pron.com.br/editoria/almanaque/news/58427/?noticia=GLAUBER+SEM+CENSURA |title=Glauber sem censura - Paraná-Online - Paranaense como você |publisher=Pron.com.br |date=2013-01-19 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://correiodobrasil.com.br/di-sem-censura/54075/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708184915/http://correiodobrasil.com.br/di-sem-censura/54075/ |archivedate=2012-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meucinediario.wordpress.com/2012/07/31/censored-films-in-brazil-1908-1988-2/ |title=CENSORED FILMS IN BRAZIL, 1908-1988 &amp;#124; DIÁRIO CINEMATOGRÁFICO |publisher=Meucinediario.wordpress.com |date=2012-07-31 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2011: ''[[A Serbian Film]]'':

''A Serbian Film'' had its release in Brazil liberated on August 5, 2011. The exception is Rio de Janeiro estate, where the film was forbidden due a lawsuit filed by the [[Democrats (Brazil)|Democrats]] political party, who claim that the pedophilia scenes infringe the part of the Brazilian Constitution that protects children (Estatuto da Criança e do Adolescente).

===Canada===
{{main|Film censorship in Canada}}
At present, only films containing prohibited material (such as child pornography) or under court order (such as libel or copyright infringement) are banned in Canadian provinces. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===China===
{{main|Film censorship in China|Hong Kong motion picture rating system}}
Republic of China (Taiwan) has attempted age-based rating system as early as November 1948, become a democracy since the 1980s, and technically dropped censorship requirement in its film law in 2015, despite it still may not issue the Restricted rating occasionally, if the film elicits feelings of shame or disgust in persons over the age of 18. In Mainland China, film censorship, often on political grounds, is rampant. Films in Mainland China are currently reviewed by the [[State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television]] (SAPPRFT) (Chinese: 国家新闻出版广电总局) which dictates whether, when, and how a movie gets released.

===India===
{{Main article|Film censorship in India}}In India, films are censored by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), a statutory [[censorship]] and [[Motion picture content rating system|classification]] body       under the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Ministry of Information and Broadcasting]], [[Government of India]]. Films should be certified by the board to publicly exhibit it in India, including films shown in television. CBFC is considered to be one of the most powerful censor boards in the world due to its strict ways of functioning.

===Iran===

{{main|Film censorship in Iran}}
All films depicting anything deemed contrary to Islamic morals are banned outright in Iran.

===Ireland===
{{main|Film censorship in the Republic of Ireland}}
Due to the small size of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], films banned by the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC) were rarely even submitted for release in Ireland, due to the high costs of promotion and distribution for such a small audience. Similarly, BBFC cuts are often left in DVD releases, due to the difficulties in separating the two film supplies.

This changed in 2000; many of these films have since been unbanned and rated anywhere from PG to 18. During the review process it was decided that no more films would be banned for either theatre or video release, but some bans are still in place.
Banned films can still be viewed at private members' clubs with 18+ age limits.

===Israel===
All [[Germany|German]] films were banned from 1956 until 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UyIvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zN4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=971,1381626&amp;dq=israel+bans+film&amp;hl=en Israel lifts total ban on German films.] ''Canadian Jewish Chronicle Review.'' 14 April 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysia===
{{Main article|Film censorship in Malaysia}}

===South Africa===
During the Apartheid regime, films depicting interracial couples were banned and/or censored for content - the James Bond films ''Live and Let Die'' and ''A View To A Kill'' had love scenes which were censored by the South African government.{{citation needed |date=November 2013}}

===South Korea===
{{Main article |Film censorship in South Korea}}

According to the Internet Movie Database, there are no currently-banned films in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of banned films in South Korea|url=https://www.imdb.com/search/title?certificates=kr:(banned)|accessdate=2010-12-17|publisher=The Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, sexual scenes have been a major issue that pits filmmakers against the Media Rating Board. Pubic hair and male or female genitalia are disallowed on the screen, unless they are digitally blurred. In rare cases extreme violence, obscene language, or certain portrayals of drug use may also be an issue. Korea has a five level rating systems; G, PG-12, PG-15, PG-18 and Restricted.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|Film censorship in the United Kingdom}}
The infamous [[video nasty]] list was created in 1982 to protect against obscenity. Films on this list were banned and distributors of said films were liable to be prosecuted (some of the films were banned before the list was made). This list banned 74 films at one point in the mid-1980s; the list was eventually trimmed down, and only 39 films were successfully prosecuted. Most of the films (even of the 39 successfully prosecuted) have now been approved by the [[BBFC]], cut or uncut (see [[Video Recordings Act 1984]]).

===United States===
{{Main article|Film censorship in the United States}}
The United States has no federal agency charged with either permitting or restricting the exhibition of motion pictures. Most instances of films being banned are via ordinances or proclamations by city or state governments.&lt;ref&gt;Wittern-Keller, Laura. Freedom of the Screen: Legal Challenges to State Film Censorship. University Press of Kentucky, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are instances of films being judicially found to be of an obscene nature and subject to specific laws against such material (i.e., [[child pornography]]).  Such findings are usually only legally binding in the jurisdiction of the court making such a ruling.

The established [[Cinema of the United States|film industry in the United States]] began a form of self-censorship in the late 1920s called the [[Motion Picture Production Code]] to forestall any possible formation of a federal censoring agency. In 1968, the Production Code was superseded by the [[MPAA film rating system]].

In Soviet Union most foreign films never had been shown thus avoiding the need for banning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20626">'''Flexibility''' is a [[personality trait]] that describes the extent to which a person can [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with changes in circumstances and think about problems and tasks in novel, creative ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpc7CJH1-s8C&amp;pg=PA731 |title=Encyclopedia of creativity |volume=1 |chapter=Flexibility |author=Becky Thurston, Mark Runco|isbn=9780122270758 |date=August 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This trait is used when stressors or unexpected events occur, requiring a person to change their stance, outlook, or commitment. Flexible personality should not be confused with [[cognitive flexibility]], which is the ability to switch between two concepts, as well as simultaneously think about multiple concepts. Researchers of cognitive flexibility describe it as the ability to switch one's thinking and attention between tasks.&lt;ref name="Miyake"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miyake|first=A|author2=Friedman, N P |author3=Emerson, M J. |author4=Witzki, A H |author5=Howerter, A |author6= Wagner, T |title=The unity and diversity of executive functions and their contributions to complex "frontal lobe" tasks: A latent variable analysis|journal=Cognitive Psychology|year=2000|volume=41|pages=49–100|doi=10.1006/cogp.1999.0734|pmid=10945922 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flexibility, or '''psychological flexibility''', as it is sometimes referred to, is the ability to adapt to situational demands, balance life demands, and commit to behaviors.

==Measures/assessments==
Due to the different facets of the definition of psychological flexibility, there are many problems when measuring it. There are multiple questionnaires that attempt to do so.

===Acceptance and Action Questionnaire===
The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ) was developed in order to measure [[experiential avoidance]]. This test found that higher levels of avoidance were linked to higher levels of general psychopathology, depression, anxiety, fears, and a lower quality of life. It also measured avoidant coping and self-deceptive positivity.&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayes|first1=Steven|author2=Kirk Strosahl|author3=Kelly Wilson|author4=Richard Bissett|author5=Jacqueline Pistorello|author6=Dosheen Toarmino|author7=Melissa Polusny|author8=Thane Dykstra|author9=Sonja Batten|author10=John Bergan|author11=Sherry Stewart|author12=Michael Zvolensky|author13=Georg Eifert|author14=Frank Bond|author15=John Forsyth|author16=Maria Karekla|author17=Susan McCurry|title=Measuring Experiential Avoidance: A Preliminary Test of a Working Model|journal=The Psychological Record|date=2004|volume=54|issue=4|pages=553–578|url=http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1359&amp;context=tpr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later decided that the AAQ actually measured psychological flexibility, not experiential avoidance.&lt;ref name="Hayesagain"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayes|first=Steven|title=Acceptance &amp; Action Questionnaire (AAQ) and Variations|url=http://contextualscience.org/acceptance_action_questionnaire_aaq_and_variations|publisher=Association for Contextual Behavioral Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used until the AAQ-II was created.

===Acceptance and Action Questionnaire II===
The AAQ-II was developed in order to improve upon the faults of the AAQ. The original AAQ had faults in scale brevity, item wording, and item selection procedures that caused insufficient alpha levels to be obtained in measurements.&lt;ref name="Hayesagain" /&gt; The AAQ-II scores were found to predict many outcomes, including mental health and work absence rates. The AAQ-II also was found to be more psychometrically consistent than the original AAQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bond|first=F.W. |author2=S.C. Hayes |author3=R.A. Baer |author4=K.M.

Laboratory measures of flexibility are consistent with how flexible people are in their actual lives. Flexibility measured in laboratory settings even predicted how flexible people will be in real life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheng|first=C.|title=Assessing Coping Flexibility in Real-life and Laboratory Settings: A Multimethod Approach|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2001|volume=80|issue=5|pages=814–833|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.5.814}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently however, the validity of the AAQ has again been brought into question, primarily by inconsistent results. Recent studies have shown that both versions of the AAQ appear to measure the same thing, which is neuroticism/negative affect rather than experiential avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.beth.2017.08.008 | title=Experiential Avoidance: An Examination of the Construct Validity of the AAQ-II and MEAQ | year=2017 | journal=Behavior Therapy | last1 = Rochefort | first1 = Catherine | last2 = Baldwin | first2 = Austin S. | last3 = Chmielewski | first3 = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandoz|title=The role of psychological flexibility in the relationship between parent and adolescent distress|journal=Journal of Child and Family Studies|date=2014|doi=10.1007/s10826-014-9947-y|volume=24|issue=5|pages=1406–1418}}&lt;/ref&gt; When parents are psychologically inflexible they cause more stress in their families. A similar study looked at the longitudinal relationship between perceived parenting style and psychological flexibility among students over six years (7th–12th [[Grading in education|grade]]). Results showed that psychological flexibility decreased with age, illustrating that as children grow older they become more set in their thoughts and habits, being less likely to change them due to circumstances. Results also indicated that [[Parenting styles#Authoritarian parenting|authoritarian parenting styles]] predicted low psychological flexibility in children. This demonstrates that parents who over-control their children tend to restrict how well their children cope with stressors in life. Lastly, results showed that children with psychological flexibility in 9th grade were more likely to have decreases in authoritarian and increases in authoritative parenting style later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=K.E. |author2=J. Ciarrochi |author3=P.C. Heaven|title=Inflexible Parents, Inflexible Kids: a 6-year Longitudinal Study of Parenting Style and the Development of Psychological Flexibility in Adolescents|journal=Journal of Youth Adolescence|date=2012|volume=41|issue=8|pages=1053–1066|doi=10.1007/s10964-012-9744-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parenting styles#Authoritative parenting|Authoritative parenting styles]] seem to be associated with psychological flexibility in children. Authoritative parents tend to be more warm, fair, and encouraging than other parenting styles which may be why children raised by this style have more psychological flexibility. The children are encouraged to be independent and are supported, so they are able to adjust to situations that do not go as predicted.

===Work environment===
Psychological flexibility has been found to improve [[mental health]] and absence rates.&lt;ref name="bondtheabilityofpsychologicalflexibilityandjobcontrol"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bond|first=F.W.|author2=P.E.

===Health===
The ability to cope and be flexible was positively associated with improved psychological health. Flexibility reduced depression, anxiety, and stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kato|first=T.|title=Development of the Coping Flexibility Scale: Evidence for the Coping Flexibility Hypothesis|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|date=2012|volume=59|issue=2|pages=262–273|doi=10.1037/a0027770}}&lt;/ref&gt; An in-depth experiment analyzed the relationship between difficulty identifying and describing feelings (DIDF) and psychological flexibility for men undergoing cancer screenings. Results showed that DIDF and psychological flexibility were reliable predictors of mental health. However, psychological flexibility only predicted mental health when DIDF was involved. Psychological flexibility allowed participants to have a better understanding of the subtleties of pleasant and unpleasant emotions. This understanding allowed participants to identify and describe their feelings better, thus enhancing their mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Landstra|first=J.B. |author2=J.

A 2 year longitudinal study found that psychological flexibility helps with long-term emotional adjustment. People who are better at enhancing and suppressing their expression of emotions are less likely to be stressed over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonanno|first=G.A.|author2=A. Papa |author3=K.

==How to improve==
Improvements can be made to psychological flexibility through training, such as through various forms of [[psychotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greenberg |first1=Leslie S. |authorlink1=Les Greenberg |last2=Rice |first2=Laura North |last3=Elliott |first3=Robert |date=1993 |title=Facilitating emotional change: the moment-by-moment process |location=New York |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nWrOpUO6ku0C&amp;pg=PA76 76] |isbn=0898629942 |oclc=27897484 |quote=Once we attend to our emotional feedback, our survival/[[Actualizing tendency|growth tendency]] ensures that we are constantly attempting to make the decision most advantageous to our well-being in terms of how we currently perceive ourselves and the situation. Thus the growth tendency is constantly pushing the organism toward adaptive flexibility and need satisfaction in a specific context. As will be noted later, therapy is a process of helping the client access and strengthen this tendency.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kashdan |first1=Todd B. |last2=Rottenberg |first2=Jonathan |date=November 2010 |title=Psychological flexibility as a fundamental aspect of health |journal=[[Clinical Psychology Review]] |volume=30 |issue=7 |pages=865–878 |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2010.03.001 |pmid=21151705 |pmc=2998793 |quote=We have mentioned empirically based interventions that describe the cultivation of flexibility as a therapeutic aim (for reviews, see Hayes, Follette, &amp; Linehan, 2004). However even when psychological interventions do not explicitly discuss flexibility as an aim of treatment (e.g., behavioral activation, cognitive therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy), flexibility is such an integral part of psychological functioning that it is almost inevitable that it will in some way be impacted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fox |first1=Kieran C.

===Acceptance and commitment therapy===
{{Main|Acceptance and commitment therapy}}
The main goal of [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT) is to increase psychological flexibility. ACT is a form of therapy that aims to help people accept unavoidable events, identify actions that will lead to goals, and acknowledge thoughts rather than accepting or disregarding them.&lt;ref name="Bach"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bach|first=P.|author2=S.C. Hayes|title=The Use of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to Prevent the Rehospitalization of Psychotic Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|date=2002|volume=70|issue=5|pages=1129–1139|doi=10.1037/0022-006x.70.5.1129}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When psychological flexibility was targeted in one study of ACT, there was a stronger reduction in psychological distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fledderus|first=M. |author2=E.T. Bohlmeijer |author3=J. Fox |author4=K. M. G. Schreurs |author5=P. Spinhoven|title=The Role of Psychological Flexibility in a Self-help Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Intervention for Psychological Distress in a Randomized Controlled Trial|journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy|date=2013|volume=51|issue=3|pages=142–151|doi=10.1016/j.brat.2012.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are six core processes in ACT interventions: acceptance, cognitive defusion, self as context, being present, values, and committed action.&lt;ref name="Gale"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Boulanger | first = Jennifer L. | last2 = Hayes | first2 = Steven C. | last3 = Lillis | first3 = Jason | authorlink2 = Steven C. Hayes | authorlink3 = Jason Lillis | editor-last = Fisher | editor-first = Gary L. | editor-last2 = Roget | editor-first2 = Nancy A. | title = Acceptance and Commitment Therapy | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Substance Abuse Prevention, Treatment, &amp; Recovery | volume = 1 | pages = 4–7 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]] | location = Thousand Oaks, CA | date = 2009 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wPJ-39gVHE0C&amp;pg=PT38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Acceptance'' is taught in order to teach people to embrace their emotions, rather than trying to get rid of them.&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt; An example of acceptance would be when people feel angry and then choose to focus on the anger and accept that they are angry, rather than trying to unleash their anger to get rid of it. ''Cognitive defusion'' teaches people to not take their thoughts as literal in order to decrease the believability of negative thoughts and increase flexibility to behave as they want.&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt; An example of cognitive defusion would be when someone thinks "I am the worst," and then notices the thought for what it is—mere words—perhaps by saying to themselves "I am having the thought that I am the worst". This is in contrast to a [[cognitive therapy]] approach where the person might challenge the thought by thinking of things in which he or she excels.

''Self as context'' attempts to have people create an awareness of their own experiences without being attached to them.&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt; This process is done in order to help people let go of specific content and experience themselves.&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt; ''Being present'' teaches people to directly experience the world by paying attention to the moment and being aware.&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt; An example of being present would be meditation and mindfulness.&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt; 
 
''Values'' teaches people to take actions for chosen qualities.&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt; An example of this is somebody who chooses to continue to improve on being a father (chosen quality) by reliving painful childhood memories about how his own father parented him (action). The purpose is not to encourage pain, but rather to allow people to deal with pain for a valued choice, such as being a good father).&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt; Lastly, ''committed action'' teaches people to make changes in behavior in order for them to reach chosen qualities.&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt; Committed action involves identifying psychological barriers that will interfere with short, medium, and longer term goals and then working through those barriers in order to reach the goals.&lt;ref name="Gale" /&gt;

[[File:LampFlowchart.svg|thumb|right| A simple flowchart representing a process for dealing with a non-functioning lamp.]] 
A '''flowchart''' is a type of [[diagram]] that represents an [[algorithm]], [[workflow]] or process. The flowchart shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows. This diagrammatic representation illustrates a solution model to a given [[Problem solving|problem]]. Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various fields.&lt;ref name ="SSEV"&gt;[http://pascal.computer.org/sev_display/index.action SEVOCAB: Software Systems Engineering Vocabulary]. Term: ''Flow chart''. Retrieved 31 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:For-loop-diagram.png|thumb|right|Flowchart of a [[C (programming language)|C-style]] ''[[for loop|for&amp;nbsp;loop]]'']]
Flowcharts are used in designing and documenting simple processes or programs. Like other types of diagrams, they help visualize what is going on and thereby help understand a process, and perhaps also find less-obvious features within the process, like flaws and [[Bottleneck (production)|bottleneck]]s. There are different types of flowcharts: each type has its own set of boxes and notations. The two most common types of boxes in a flowchart are:

* a processing step, usually called ''activity'', and denoted as a rectangular box.
* a decision, usually denoted as a diamond.
 
A flowchart is described as "cross-functional" when the chart is divided into different vertical or horizontal parts, to describe the control of different organizational units. A symbol appearing in a particular part is within the control of that organizational unit.  A cross-functional flowchart allows the author to correctly locate the responsibility for performing an action or making a decision, and to show the responsibility of each organizational unit for different parts of a single process.

Flowcharts depict certain aspects of processes and are usually complemented by other types of diagram. For instance, [[Kaoru Ishikawa]] defined the flowchart as one of the seven basic tools of quality control, next to the [[histogram]], [[Pareto chart]], [[check sheet]], [[control chart]], [[Ishikawa diagram|cause-and-effect diagram]], and the [[scatter diagram]]. Similarly, in [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], a standard concept-modeling notation used in software development, the [[activity diagram]], which is a type of flowchart, is just one of many different diagram types.

[[Nassi-Shneiderman diagram]]s and [[DRAKON|Drakon-charts]] are an alternative notation for process flow.

Common alternative names include: flow chart, process flowchart, functional flowchart, process map, process chart, functional process chart, business process model, process model, process [[flow diagram]], [[workflow|work flow]] diagram, business flow diagram. The terms "flowchart" and "flow chart" are used interchangeably.

The underlying [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] structure of a flowchart is a flow graph, which abstracts away node types, their contents and other ancillary information.

== History ==
The first structured method for documenting process flow, the "[[flow process chart]]", was introduced by [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth|Frank]] and [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|Lillian Gilbreth]] in the presentation "Process Charts: First Steps in Finding the One Best Way to do Work", to members of the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Lillian Moller Gilbreth (1921) ''[https://engineering.purdue.edu/IE/GilbrethLibrary/gilbrethproject/processcharts.pdf Process Charts]''. American Society of Mechanical Engineers.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gilbreths' tools quickly found their way into [[industrial engineering]] curricula. In the early 1930s, an industrial engineer, [[Allan H. Mogensen]] began to train business people in the use of some of the tools of industrial engineering at his Work Simplification Conferences in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

Art Spinanger, a 1944 graduate of [[Allan H. Mogensen|Mogensen]]'s class, took the tools back to [[Procter and Gamble]] where he developed their Deliberate Methods Change Program.  [[Benjamin S. Graham|Ben S. Graham]], another 1944 graduate, Director of Formcraft Engineering at [[Standard Register Industrial]], applied the flow process chart to information processing with his development of the multi-flow process chart, to present multiple documents and their relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Graham, Jr. |first = Ben S. |title = People come first |work = Keynote Address at ''Workflow Canada'' |url = http://www.worksimp.com/articles/keynoteworkflowcanada.htm |date = 10 June 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, [[ASME]] adopted a symbol set derived from Gilbreth's original work as the "ASME Standard: Operation and Flow Process Charts."&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Mechanical Engineers (1947) ''ASME standard; operation and flow process charts''. New York, 1947. ([http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/005735891 online version])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Douglas Hartree]] in 1949 explained that [[Herman Goldstine]] and [[John von Neumann]] had developed a flowchart (originally, diagram) to plan computer programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hartree | first = Douglas | authorlink = Douglas Rayner Hartree |url=https://archive.org/stream/calculatinginstr00doug#page/112/mode/2up| title =Calculating Instruments and Machines | publisher = The University of Illinois Press | year = 1949 | page = 112}}&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporary account was endorsed by IBM engineers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bashe | first = Charles | title = IBM's Early Computers | publisher = The MIT Press | year = 1986 | page = 327}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Goldstine's personal recollections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Goldstine  | first = Herman  | authorlink = Herman H. Goldstine  | title = The Computer from Pascal to Von Neumann  | publisher = Princeton University Press   | year = 1972  | pages = 266–267  | isbn = 0-691-08104-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original programming flowcharts of Goldstine and von Neumann can be found in their unpublished report, "Planning and coding of problems for an electronic computing instrument, Part II, Volume 1" (1947), which is reproduced in von Neumann's collected works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Taub | first = Abraham | authorlink = Abraham Haskel Taub | title = John von Neumann Collected Works | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1963 | volume = 5 | pages = 80–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flowchart became a popular tool for describing [[computer algorithm]]s, but its popularity decreased in the 1970s, when interactive [[computer terminal]]s and [[third-generation programming language]]s became common tools for [[computer programming]], since algorithms can be expressed more concisely as [[source code]] in such [[programming language|languages]]. Often [[pseudo-code]] is used, which uses the common idioms of such languages without strictly adhering to the details of a particular one.

Nowadays flowcharts are still used for describing [[computer algorithm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bohl, Rynn: "Tools for Structured and Object-Oriented Design", Prentice Hall, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern techniques such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[activity diagram]]s and [[DRAKON|Drakon-charts]] can be considered to be extensions of the flowchart.

== Types ==
Sterneckert (2003) suggested that flowcharts can be modeled from the perspective of different user groups (such as managers, system analysts and clerks), and that there are four general types:&lt;ref name="Ster03"&gt;Alan B. Sterneckert (2003) ''Critical Incident Management''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8z93xStbEpAC&amp;lpg=PP126&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 126]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Document flowcharts'', showing controls over a document-flow through a system
* ''Data flowcharts'', showing controls over a data-flow in a system
* ''System flowcharts'', showing controls at a physical or resource level
* ''Program flowchart'', showing the controls in a program within a system
Notice that every type of flowchart focuses on some kind of control, rather than on the particular flow itself.&lt;ref name="Ster03"/&gt;

However, there are some different classifications. For example, Andrew Veronis (1978) named three basic types of flowcharts: the ''system flowchart'', the ''general flowchart'', and the ''detailed flowchart''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Veronis (1978) ''Microprocessors: Design and Applications''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GZ9QAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22three+basic+types+of+flowcharts+%28ie,+the+system+flowchart,+the+general+flowchart,+and+the+detailed+flowchart%29.%22&amp;dq=%22three+basic+types+of+flowcharts+%28ie,+the+system+flowchart,+the+general+flowchart,+and+the+detailed+flowchart%29.%22&amp;as_brr=0 p. 111]&lt;/ref&gt; That same year Marilyn Bohl (1978) stated "in practice, two kinds of flowcharts are used in solution planning: ''system flowcharts'' and ''program flowcharts''...".&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Bohl (1978) ''A Guide for Programmers''. p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Mark A. Fryman (2001) identified more differences: "Decision flowcharts, logic flowcharts, systems flowcharts, product flowcharts, and process flowcharts are just a few of the different types of flowcharts that are used in business and government".&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Fryman (2001) ''Quality and Process Improvement''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=M-_B7czAy0kC&amp;pg=PA169#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 169].&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many diagram techniques are similar to flowcharts but carry a different name, such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[activity diagram]]s.

=== Other symbols ===
The ANSI/ISO standards include symbols beyond the basic shapes. Some are:&lt;ref name=IBM1970 /&gt;&lt;ref name=RFF /&gt;

* ''Data File'' or ''Database'' represented by a cylinder (disk drive).
* ''Document'' represented as a [[rectangle]] with a wavy base.
* ''Manual input'' represented by [[quadrilateral]], with the top irregularly sloping up from left to right, like the side view of a keyboard.
* ''Manual operation'' represented by a [[trapezoid]] with the longest parallel side at the top, to represent an operation or adjustment to process that can only be made manually.
* ''Parallel Mode'' represented by two horizontal lines at the beginning or ending of simultaneous operations&lt;ref name=IBM1970 /&gt;
* ''Preparation'' or ''Initialization'' represented by an elongated [[hexagon]], originally used for steps like setting a switch or initializing a routine.

For [[Parallel computing|parallel]] and [[Concurrent computing|concurrent]] processing the ''Parallel Mode'' horizontal lines&lt;ref name="Valvano2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jonathan W.

* At a ''[[Fork–join model|fork]]'', the process creates one or more additional processes, indicated by a bar with one incoming path and two or more outgoing paths. 
* At a ''join'', two or more processes continue as a single process, indicated by a bar with several incoming paths and one outgoing path. All processes must complete before the single process continues.&lt;ref name="Nakatsu2009" /&gt;

== Software ==

=== Diagramming ===
[[File:Flowgorithm Editor.png|thumb|right|Flowgorithm]]
Any drawing program can be used to create flowchart diagrams, but these will have no underlying data model to share data with databases or other programs such as [[project management]] systems or [[spreadsheet]]. Some tools such as [[yEd]], [[Inkscape]] and [[Microsoft Visio]] offer special support for flowchart drawing. Many software packages exist that can create flowcharts automatically, either directly from a programming language source code, or from a flowchart description language.

There are several applications and [[visual programming languages]]&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Brad A. "[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/papers/chi86vltax.pdf Visual programming, programming by example, and program visualization: a taxonomy.]" ACM SIGCHI Bulletin. Vol. 17. No. 4. ACM, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; that use flowcharts to represent and execute programs. Generally these are used as teaching tools for beginner students. Examples include [[Flowgorithm]], [[Raptor (programming language)|Raptor]]. LARP, [[Visual Logic]], and VisiRule.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16719">A '''giving circle''' is a form of participatory [[philanthropy]] where groups of individuals donate their own money or time to a pooled fund, decide together where to give these away to [[charitable organization|charity]] or [[community project]]s and, in doing so, seek to increase their awareness of and engagement in the issues covered by the charity or community project.&lt;ref name="Eikenberry, Angela and Bearman, Jessica"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://media.npr.org/documents/2009/may/givingcircles.pdf |title= The Impact of Giving Together: a snapshot of a study on giving circles' influence on philanthropic &amp; civic behaviors, knowledge &amp; attitudes|author1=Eikenberry, Angela  |author2=Bearman, Jessica |publisher= [[Forum of Regional Associations of Grantmakers]]|date= May 2009|accessdate= May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many circles, in addition to donating their money, also contribute their time and skills to support local causes.

== Structure and function ==

The current manifestation of giving circles is a relatively new trend, but it is built on traditions dating back hundreds of years to [[benefit society|mutual aid societies]] and other forms of giving for the community. In the [[United States]], giving circles were initially composed of women; they are now more diverse in race, age and gender, although women continue to make up the majority of members.&lt;ref name="Growing"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.academia.edu/244842/Giving_Circles_Growing_Grassroots_Philanthropy | title=Giving Circles: Growing Grassroots Philanthropy | author=Eikenberry, Angela M | journal=[[Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly]] |date=September 2006  | volume=35 | issue=3 | pages=517–532 | doi=10.1177/0899764006287482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of the circles can be informal or formal. On the informal side, circles may vote and choose an organization to support and each member writes an individual [[cheque|check]]. Formal circles may have their money housed at a local community foundation and have staff that support the work of the circle. Giving circles can range in size from a handful of members to several hundred.

Individual donors who join or form a giving circle typically seek to [[community building|build community]] within their circle through social events, in addition to the economic impacts of the groups.

In a 2007 study, the [[Forum of Regional Associations of Grantmakers]]' New Ventures in Philanthropy initiative identified approximately 400 giving circles in the United States, more than double the number from two years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1857011,00.html |title= Report: Giving Circles |author=Kadlec, Dan|work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=November 5, 2008|accessdate= June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of 160 circles, published in 2008, found they had leveraged nearly $100 million, $13 million of this in 2006 alone. Nearly 12,000 people took part in the 160 giving circles surveyed. Nearly half of circles have male participants, and the popularity of giving circles is also growing among racial, ethnic and tribal communities as well as in the gay and lesbian community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givingforum.org/s_forum/doc.asp?CID=22&amp;DID=9565 |title=Report: Giving Circles Are Here to Stay |publisher=[[Forum of Regional Associations of Grantmakers]] |year=2008 |accessdate=May 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219033229/http://givingforum.org/s_forum/doc.asp?CID=22&amp;DID=9565 |archivedate=February 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study conducted in 2005 by Angela M. Eikenberry, an associate professor at the [[University of Nebraska at Omaha]], found that giving circles generally bring both long-time and new philanthropists to organized philanthropy.&lt;ref name= "Growing"/&gt; For both groups, participation seems to increase levels of giving while bringing “new money” to the [[nonprofit sector]]; especially to small and locally based organizations. Members also seem to learn about and give to organizations and individuals, and in areas of interest, they most likely would not have given to otherwise. In addition, members are more thoughtful, focused and strategic in their personal giving because of educational experiences in the giving circle. These findings are based on 30 interviews with giving circle participants, staff, and philanthropic professionals working with giving circles, document analysis, and secondary data.

Research by Eikenberry and Jessica Bearman, published in 2009, and largely based on a survey of giving circle members compared to a control group, found that giving circles influence members to give more and to give more strategically. Their members give to a wide array of organizations and are highly engaged in the community. Giving circles increase members’ knowledge about philanthropy, nonprofits, and the community but have a mixed influence on members’ attitudes about philanthropy, nonprofit and government roles, and political/social abilities and values. Level of engagement, length of engagement, and size of the giving circle seem to matter most, when it comes to understanding giving circles’ effects on members.&lt;ref name="Eikenberry, Angela and Bearman, Jessica"/&gt;

Amplifier Giving (www.AmplifierGiving.org) is the first concerted effort to network Jewish giving circles, catalyze the creation of new giving circles, educate circle members on best practices in philanthropy, and create a platform to connect NGOs and Jewish giving circles to each other efficiently and effectively. The Amplifier network includes 50 giving circles and 369 organizations. The Amplifier website has a circle and organization directory, online common grant application system, and a resource library with information about how to start and sustain a giving circle.&lt;ref name="Amplifier"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amplifiergiving.org/ | title=Home page | publisher=Amplifier Giving | accessdate=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
The Kew Giving Circle in [[Kew]], south west [[London]], started meeting in January 1999 and is still active. It is the first recorded giving circle in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2000/apr/23/charitablegiving.observercashsection| title=Squaring the Charity Circle|author=Bibby, Andrew |work= [[The Observer]]|date= April 23, 2000| accessdate= January 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its members contribute to a pooled [[Charities Aid Foundation]] account and meet to agree payments from the account to their selected charities.

The Funding Network is the largest known and first open giving circle in the UK.  It is a charity that runs ''[[Dragons' Den]]''-style events to bring together potential donors and charities to fund positive social change. It has raised over £5 million for over 700 projects across the globe.&lt;ref name=Impact&gt;{{cite web |title=The Funding Network 10th Anniversary Impact Report |url=http://www.thefundingnetwork.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/TFN_ImpactReport_.pdf |work=10th Impact Report |publisher=The Funding Network |date=July 2012 |accessdate=March 19, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621015114/http://www.thefundingnetwork.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/TFN_ImpactReport_.pdf |archivedate=June 21, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4888">The '''interstimulus interval''' (often abbreviated as '''ISI''')  is the temporal interval between the offset of one [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] to the onset of another. For instance, [[Max Wertheimer]] did experiments with two stationary, flashing lights that at some interstimulus intervals appeared to the subject as moving instead of stationary. In these experiments, the interstimulus interval is simply the time between the two flashes. The ISI plays a large role in the [[phi phenomenon]] (Wertheimer) since the illusion of motion is directly due to the length of the interval between stimuli. When the ISI is shorter, for example between two flashing lines alternating back and forth, we perceive the change in stimuli to be movement.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Wertheimer discovered that the space between the two lines is filled in by our brains and that the faster the lines alternate, the more likely we are to perceive it as one line moving back and forth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When the stimuli move fast enough, this creates the illusion of a moving picture like a movie or cartoon. Phi phenomenon is very similar to [[beta movement]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Cummins, E. (n.d.). The Phi Phenomenon: Definition &amp; Example. Retrieved May 03, 2016, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://study.com/academy/lesson/the-phi-phenomenon-definition-lesson.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As it applies to [[classical conditioning]], the term interstimulus interval is used to represent the gap of time between the start of the conditioned stimulus and the start of the unconditioned stimulus.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning and Memory: From Brain to Behavior|last=Gluck|first=Mark A.|last2=Mercado|first2=Eduardo|last3=Myers|first3=Catherine E.|publisher=Worth Publishers|date=January 7, 2013|isbn=1429240148|location=New York, NY|pages=124–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be the case of [[Pavlov's dogs|Pavlov's dog]], where the time between the [[unconditioned stimulus]], the food, and the [[Classical conditioning|conditioned stimulus]], the bell, is considered the ISI. More particularly, ISI is often used in [[eyeblink conditioning]] (a widely studied type of classical conditioning involving puffs of air blown into the subject's eyes) where the ISI can effect learning based on the size of the time gap.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; What is of interest in this particular type of classical conditioning is that when the subject is conditioned to blink after the conditioned stimulus (tone), the blink will take place within the time period between the tone and the air puff, making the subject's eyes close before the puff can reach the eyes, protecting them from the air.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The timing between the conditioned and unconditioned stimulus is important. There are two types of approaches for eye blink conditioning when it comes to timing between the stimuli. The first is called delay conditioning, which is when the conditioned stimulus (tone) starts, then continues until the unconditioned stimulus (air puff) is released after a delay, then they both suspend at the same time.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The other is called trace conditioning, where the conditioned stimulus (tone) is shorter and stops before the unconditioned stimulus (air puff) begins, leaving a gap between the two stimuli.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This type of conditioning forces the subject, in this particular example, a bunny, to remember to link the conditioned stimulus with the unconditioned stimulus.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The distinction between the two types of conditioning is of importance because the difference in the interstimulus interval (ISI) can have major effects on learning.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; For example, it has been shown that the length of the ISI, as well as the variability, changes habituation in subjects.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Davis, M. (1970). Effects of interstimulus interval length and variability on startle-response habituation in the rat. ''Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology'', ''72''(2), 177-192. doi:10.1037/h0029472&lt;/ref&gt; When ISI is short and constant, habituation will happen more rapidly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The changes in the gap of time can be minuscule, from tens of milliseconds to several seconds long, and the effects it will have will still be important.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Buonomano, D. V., Bramen, J., &amp; Khodadadifar, M. (2009). Influence of the interstimulus interval on temporal processing and learning: Testing the state-dependent network model. ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,'' ''364''(1525), 1865-1873. doi:10.1098/rstb.2009.0019&lt;/ref&gt; Sensory and motor tasks are among the elements that can be enhanced or hindered based on timing, like speech processing, which can be influenced by "the ability to discriminate the interval and duration of sounds."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{Jainism}}
In [[Jainism]], '''Kashaya''' (loose translation: ''Passion'') are aspects of a person that can be gained during his or her worldly life. According to the Jaina religion as long as a person has Kashayas, they will not escape the cycle of life and death. There are four different kind of Kashayas, each being able to gain their own kinds of intensity.

== Overview ==
According to the Jain text, ''[[Sarvārthasiddhi]]'', "He who has passions causes injury to himself by himself. Whether injury is then caused to other living beings or not, it is immaterial."{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=197}}

Spiritually, the goal of Jainism is to rid oneself of the worldly life and become free from the cycle of [[reincarnation]]. When one develop attachment or passions, this hinders the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] progress of their soul. Jainas believe that by reacting without passion and staying tranquil, one can break the cycle which forms more karma.

==The Four Kashayas==
{{further|Causes of Karma}}
The four ''kasaya'' are: ''krodha'' (anger), ''lobha'' (greed), ''mana'' (ego) and ''maya'' (deceit). Out of the many causes of bondage, emotions or passions are considered as the main cause of ''[[Bandha (Jainism)|bandha]]'' or bondage. The [[Karma in Jainism|karmas]] are literally bound on account of the stickiness of the soul due to existence of various passions or mental dispositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass | year =1998 | location =New Delhi | isbn =81-208-1578-5 }} p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The passions like anger, pride, deceit and greed are called sticky (''kaṣāyas'') because they act like glue in making karmic particles stick to the soul resulting in ''bandha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Reichenbach  | first =Bruce  | title =Karma, Causation, and Divine Intervention  | journal =Philosophy East and West  | volume =39  | issue =2  | pages =135–149  | publisher =University of Hawai press  | date =April 1989  | jstor =1399374| doi =10.2307/1399374 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The karmic inflow on account of ''yoga'' driven by passions and emotions cause a long term inflow of karma prolonging the cycle of reincarnations. On the other hand, the karmic inflows on account of actions that are not driven by passions and emotions have only a transient, short-lived karmic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Tatia | first = Nathmal | title =Tattvārtha Sūtra: That Which Is of Vācaka Umāsvāti | publisher =Rowman Altamira | year =1994 | location =Lanham, MD | language =Sanskrit, English | isbn =0-7619-8993-5 }} p.152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Kuhn | first =Hermann | title =Karma, The Mechanism : Create Your Own Fate | publisher =Crosswind Publishing | year =2001 | location =Wunstorf, Germany | isbn =3-9806211-4-6 }} p.33&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the ancient Jain texts talk of subduing these negative emotions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Johnson | first =W.J. | title =Harmless souls: karmic bondage and religious change in early Jainism with special reference to Umāsvāti and Kundakunda | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publishers| year =1995 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-1309-X }}  p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Negating kashayas can be done by remembering the opposites of kasahayas : Opposite of Krodha (Anger) is Kshama (Forgiveness). To avoid Krodha kashayas, one needs to remember to forgive. Opposite of lobha (greed) is Daan (Charity), one needs to remember to give away. Opposite of Mana(Ego)  is humility, one needs to be humble. Opposite of Deceit is honesty, one needs to be honest in all conditions to not get deceit kashayas. 

Most difficult Kashaya to overcome is Greed. 

When he wishes that which is good for him, he should get rid of the four faults—anger, pride, deceit and greed—which increase the evil. Anger and pride when not suppressed, and deceit and greed when arising: all these four black passions water the roots of re-birth.

—''Daśavaikālika sūtra, 8:36–39''

==Levels Of Intensity==
* Anantanubadh ('''Extremely Severe''') - This holds back one's ability to have correct beliefs/proper conduct.
* Apratyakhanavarana ('''Severe''') -  This holds back partial renunciation but does not affect true belief. While it is active, one cannot take partial vows.
* Pratyakhanavarana ('''Moderate''') - This holds back total renunciation, but does not affect correct belief and partial renunciation. While it is active, partial renunciation is possible, but monkhood is not.
* Sanjvalana ('''Slight'''): This holds back the attainment of total correct conduct, but does not affect right belief and monkhood. While it is active, initiation into monkhood and spiritual progress are possible, but becoming a [[vitragi]] is not.

The degrees of strength of the kasayas are illustrated by examples. The 4 species of anger are to be likened unto a line drawn in stone, in earth, in dust and in water. The first can only be removed with great effort, each following one always more easily. Likewise also, the lifelong enduring anger is only combated in its effect with exceeding strength and difficulty whilst the effect of the three remaining species accordingly diminishes in power and can, therefore, also more easily be destroyed. The degrees of pride are to be likened unto a pillar of stone, a bone, a piece of wood, and the vine of a creeper; the inflexibility correspondingly decreases. The species of deceitfulness are to be compared to a bamboo root, the horn of a ram, the urine of a cow, and a piece of wood. The crookedness of each of these is removed more easily than in the one preceding it. (The zig zag line of the cow's urine disappears through the influence of wind and weather.) The degrees of greed correspond to scarlet colour, to greater or smaller dirt, and to a spot of turmeric, which soil a garment: the scarlet is hardly removable, the dirt with more or less trouble, and the spot of turmeric can be removed with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Glasenapp | first =Helmuth Von | editor =H.

[[File:Treny normal.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jan Kochanowski]] with dead daughter in painting inspired by the poet's ''[[Laments (Treny)|Laments]]'']]

A '''lament''' or '''lamentation''' is a passionate expression of [[grief]], often in [[music]], [[poetry]], or [[song]] form. The grief is most often born of [[regret]], or [[mourning]]. Laments can also be expressed in a verbal manner, where the participant would lament about something they regret or someone they've lost, usually accompanied by wailing, [[Complaint|moaning]] and/or [[crying]].&lt;ref&gt;Piotr Michalowski, trans., Lamentation over the Destruction of Sumer and Ur (Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 1989), 39–62; cited in Nancy Lee, Lyrics of Lament: From Tragedy to Transformation (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Laments constitute some of the oldest forms of writing and examples are present across human cultures.  

==History==
[[File:Egyptian mourners001.jpg|thumb|150px|Egyptian women weeping and lamenting.]]
Many of the oldest and most lasting poems in human [[history]] have been laments.&lt;ref&gt;Linda M. Austin, "The Lament and the Rhetoric of the Sublime" ''Nineteenth-Century Literature'' '''53'''.3 (December 1998:279-306) traces the literary rhetoric  evoking a voice crying.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lament for Sumer and Ur]] dates back at least 4000 years to ancient [[Sumer]], the world's first urban civilization. Laments are present in both the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', and laments continued to be sung in [[elegiacs]] accompanied by the [[aulos]] in classical and [[Hellenistic]] Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Alexiou, ''Ritual Lament in Greek Tradition'' (Cambridge University Press) 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of laments appear in ''[[Beowulf]]'', in the [[Hindu]] [[Veda]]s, and in [[ancient Near Eastern]] religious texts. They are included in the Mesopotamian city laments such as the [[Lament for Ur]] and the [[Jew]]ish [[Tanakh]], (which would later become the [[Christian]] [[Old Testament]]).

In many oral traditions, both early and modern, the lament has been a genre usually performed by women:&lt;ref&gt;Alexiou 1974; Angela Bourke, "More in anger than in sorrow: Irish women's lament poetry", in Joan Newlon Radnor, ed., ''Feminist Messages: Coding in Women's Folk Culture'' (Urbana: Illinois University Press) 1993:160-82.&lt;/ref&gt; Batya Weinbaum made a case for the spontaneous lament of women chanters in the creation of the oral tradition that resulted in the ''[[Iliad]]''&lt;ref&gt;Batya Weinbaum, "Lament Ritual Transformed into Literature: Positing Women's Prayer as Cornerstone in Western Classical Literature" ''The Journal of American Folklore'' '''114''' No. 451 (Winter 2001:20-39).&lt;/ref&gt; The material of lament, the "sound of trauma" is as much an element in the [[Book of Job]] as in the genre of [[pastoral elegy]], such as [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]'s "Adonais" or [[Matthew Arnold]]'s "Thyrsis".&lt;ref&gt;Austin 1998:280f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Lamentations]] or ''Lamentations of Jeremiah'' figures in the Old Testament. The ''[[Lamentation of Christ]]'' (under many closely variant terms) is a common subject from the [[Life of Christ in art|''Life of Christ'' in art]], showing his dead body being mourned after the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]].

A Lament in The Book of Lamentations or in the [[Psalms]] (in the particular Lament/Complaint Psalms of the [[Tanakh]], may be looked at as "a cry of need in a context of crisis when Israel lacks the resources to fend for itself."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Brueggeman, ''An Unsettling God'', (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2009) 13&lt;/ref&gt; Another way of looking at it is all the more basic: laments simply being "appeals for divine help in distress".&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Coogan, ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament'', (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009) 370&lt;/ref&gt; These laments, too, often have a set format: an address to God, description of the suffering/anguish which one seeks relief, a petition for help and deliverance, a curse towards one's enemies, an expression of the belief of ones innocence or a confession of the lack thereof, a vow corresponding to an expected divine response, and lastly, a song of thanksgiving.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Coogan, ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009) 370&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of a general format of this, both in the individual and communal laments, can be seen in Psalm 3 and Psalm 44 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Coogan, ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament,'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009) 370&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Lament of Edward II]]'', if it is actually written by [[Edward II of England]], is the sole surviving composition of his.

A heroine's lament is a conventional fixture of [[Baroque opera|baroque]] [[opera seria]], accompanied usually by strings alone, in [[descending tetrachord]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Rosand, 2007. ''Opera in Seventeenth-Century Venice'' (University of California Press),  "The lament aria: variations on a theme" pp 377ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their plangent cantabile melodic lines, evocatively free, non-[[strophic]] construction and [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|adagio]] pace, operatic laments have remained vividly memorable soprano or mezzo-soprano [[aria]]s even when separated from the emotional pathos of their operatic contexts. An early example is Ariadne's "Lasciatemi morire", which is the only survivor of [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s lost ''Arianna''. [[Francesco Cavalli]]'s operas extended the ''lamento'' formula, in numerous exemplars, of which Ciro's "Negatemi respiri" from ''Ciro'' is notable.&lt;ref&gt;"Negatemi respiri" and several others are noted by Rosand 2007:377f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include [[Dido's Lament|Dido's lament, "When I am laid"]] ([[Henry Purcell]], ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]''), "[[Lascia ch'io pianga]]" ([[Georg Friedrich Handel]], ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo]]''), "Caro mio ben" (Tomasso or [[Giuseppe Giordani]]). The lament continued to represent a musico-dramatic high point. In the context of [[opera buffa]], the Countess's lament, "Dove sono" comes as a surprise to the audience of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s ''[[Marriage of Figaro]]'', and in [[Gioachino Rossini]]'s ''[[Barber of Seville]]'', Rosina's plaintive words at her apparent abandonment are followed, not by the expected lament aria, but by a vivid orchestral interlude of storm music. The heroine's lament remained a fixture in romantic opera, and the Marschallin's monologue in Act I of ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' can be understood as a penetrating psychological lament.&lt;ref&gt;Called "the Marschallin's Act I lament", in Jeremy Eichler, "Lushly Lamenting the Wages of Time and a Lost Golden Age" opera review in ''The New York Times'' March 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scottish laments==
The purely instrumental lament is a common form in [[pìobaireachd]] music for the [[Great Highland Bagpipe|Scottish bagpipes]]. "MacCrimmon's Lament" dates to the Jacobite uprising of 1745. The tune is held to have been written by Donald Ban MacCrimmon, piper to the MacLeods of Dunvegan, who supported the Hanoverians. It is said that Donald Ban, who was killed at Moy in 1746, had an intimation that he would not return.{{clarify|date=April 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/secondary/genericcontent_tcm4572872.asp "MacCrimmon's Lament", Foghlam Alba] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006063418/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/secondary/genericcontent_tcm4572872.asp |date=2013-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known Gaelic [[lullaby]] is "[[Griogal Cridhe]]" ("Beloved Gregor"). It was composed in 1570 after the execution of Gregor MacGregor by the Campbells. The grief-stricken widow, Marion Campbell, describes what happened as she sings to her child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/about/songs/lullabiesdandlings/index.asp "Lullabies and Dandlings", Foghlam Alba] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004070706/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/about/songs/lullabiesdandlings/index.asp |date=2013-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Cumhadh na Cloinne" (Lament for the Children) was composed by Padruig Mór MacCrimmon in the early 1650s. It is generally held to be based on the loss of seven of MacCrimmon's eight sons to an unknown illness, possibly brought to Skye by a trading vessel. Author Bridget MacKenzie, in ''Piping Traditions of Argyll'', suggests that it refers to the slaughter of the MacLeod's fighting Cromwell's forces at the Battle of Worcester. It may have been inspired by both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/about/songs/pibroch/index.asp "Pibroch songs and canntaireachd", Education Scotland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004070629/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandssongs/about/songs/pibroch/index.asp |date=2013-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Scottish laments include "Lowlands Away"{{fact|date=April 2017}}, "MacPherson's Rant", and "Hector the Hero".

==Musical form==
There is a short, free musical form appearing in the Baroque and then again in the Romantic periods, called a [[Lament bass|lament]].  It is typically a set of harmonic [[Variation (music)|variations]] in [[Homophony|homophonic]] texture, wherein the bass descends through a tetrachord, usually one suggesting a [[Minor scale|minor mode]].

{{Grammatical categories}}

In [[linguistics]], '''modality''' is a feature of language that allows for communicating things about, or based on, situations which need not be actual. More precisely, modality is signaled by grammatical expressions (''moods'') that express a speaker's general intentions (or illocutionary point) as well as the speaker's commitment to how believable, obligatory, desirable, or actual an expressed [[proposition]] is.

Sometimes, the term ''mood'' is used to refer to both mood and modality, however, the two can be distinguished according to whether they refer to the grammatical expressions of various modalities (''mood'') or the meanings so expressed (''modality''). Modality can also be considered equivalent to the idea of ''[[illocutionary force]]'' if the kinds of expressions which can express modal meanings also include [[lexical items]] such as [[performative]] verbs.

Modality is closely intertwined with other linguistic phenomena such as [[Grammatical tense|tense]] and [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[evidentiality]], [[Conditional mood|conditionals]], and others. As with other areas of linguistics, modality has been studied extensively from typological as well as formal perspectives.

An important distinction within linguistic modality is the distinction between [[epistemic]] and [[deontic]] modality. Generally speaking, epistemic modality has to do with possibility and necessity with regard to knowledge, whereas deontic modality has to do with permission and obligation according to some system of rules. The difference between the two is illustrated in the English example below:
: (1) Agatha ''must'' be the killer.
: (2) Agatha ''must'' be killed.
The sentence in (1) might be spoken by someone who has decided that all of the relevant facts in a particular murder investigation point to the conclusion that Agatha is the killer, even though it may or may not actually be the case. In contrast, (2) might be spoken by someone who has decided that, according to some standard of conduct, Agatha has committed a vile crime, and therefore the correct course of action is to kill Agatha. Note also that, although English ''must'' is ambiguous between these two interpretations, the form of the other elements in the sentences helps to disambiguate.

In standard formal approaches to '''linguistic modality''', an utterance expressing modality is one that can always roughly be paraphrased to fit the following template:

:(1) According to [a set of rules, wishes, beliefs,...] it is [necessary, possible] that [the main proposition] is the case.

The set of propositions which forms the basis of evaluation is called the '''modal base'''. The result of the evaluation is called the '''modal force'''.
For example the utterance in (2) expresses that, according to what the speaker has observed, it is necessary to conclude that John has a rather high income:

:(2) John must be earning a lot of money.

The modal base here is the knowledge of the speaker, the modal force is necessity. By contrast, (3) could be paraphrased as ‘Given his abilities, the strength of his teeth, etc., it is possible for John to open a beer bottle with his teeth’. Here, the modal base is defined by a subset of John's abilities, the modal force is possibility.

:(3) John can open a beer bottle with his teeth.

A more elaborate account of formal semantic approaches to modality is given in section 1.

Cross-linguistically, modality can be expressed by a variety of means, such as [[auxiliary verbs]] as in the examples (2) and (3),  verbal morphology ([[grammatical mood|mood]]) or adverbs. An overview of the various modal expressions across languages is given below in section 2.

[[Linguistic typology|Typological]] approaches to modality usually favour a slightly wider definition of modality and also include meanings which do not fit the template in (1) exactly. Section 3 provides an overview over the range of meanings commonly associated with modality.

==Semantic accounts==

Semantic approaches dealing with modality are traditionally based on the principles of [[modal logic]]. Both work with the notion that propositions can be mapped to sets of possible worlds, that is, a proposition can be defined as the set of worlds in which that proposition is true. For example, the proposition ‘the earth is flat’ corresponds to the set of possible worlds in which the earth is in fact flat.

In this framework, modal expressions such as ''must'' and ''can'' are then analyzed as quantifiers over a set of possible worlds. This set of worlds is given by the modal base and is said to be ''the set of accessible worlds'': For example, in sentence (2) above, the modal base is the knowledge the speaker has in the actual world. Therefore, the set of accessible worlds is defined by the information the speaker has about John. Assume for example that the speaker knows that John just bought a new luxury car and has rented a huge apartment. The speaker also knows that John is an honest person with a humble family background and doesn't play the lottery.
The set of accessible worlds is then the set of worlds in which all these propositions which the speaker knows about John are true.

The notions of '''necessity''' and '''possibility''' are then defined along the following lines: A proposition ''p'' follows necessarily from the set of accessible worlds, if all accessible worlds are part of ''p'' (that is, if ''p'' is true in all of these worlds). Applied to the example in (2) this would mean that in all the worlds which are defined by the speaker's knowledge about John, it is the case that John earns a lot of money (assuming there is no other explanation for John's wealth).

In a similar way a proposition ''p'' is possible according to the set of accessible worlds (i.e. the modal base), if some of these worlds are part of ''p''.

==Ways of expressing modality==

===Verbal Morphology===
{{Main article|Grammatical mood}}

In many languages modal categories are expressed by verbal morphology. If these verbal markers of modality are obligatory in a language, they are called [[Grammatical mood|''mood'']] markers. Well-known examples of moods in some European languages are referred to as [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], [[Conditional mood|conditional]] and [[Indicative mood|indicative]] as illustrated below with examples from [[French language|French]], all three with the verb ''avoir'' ‘to have’. As in most [[Standard Average European|Standard European]] languages, the shape of the verb conveys not only information about modality, but also about other categories such as [[Grammatical person|person]] and [[Grammatical number|number]] of the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]].

An example for a non-European language with a similar encoding of modality is [[Manam language|Manam]]. Here, a verb is prefixed by a [[morpheme]] which encodes number and person of the subject. These prefixes come in two versions, one ''realis'' version and one ''irrealis'' version. Which one is chosen depends on whether the verb refers to an actual past or present event (realis), or merely to a possible or imagined event (irrealis) (see [[#elliott2000|Elliott 2000]]).

===Auxiliaries===
{{Main article|Modal verb}}

Modal [[auxiliary verb]]s, such as the English words ''may, can, must, ought, will, shall, need, dare, might, could, would,'' and ''should'', are often used to express modality, especially in the [[Germanic languages]].

===Lexical expression===

[[Verb]]s such as "want" can be used to express modality [[lexical (semiotics)|lexically]], as can [[adverb]]s.

===Other===

Complementizers (e.g. Russian) and conjunctions (e.g. Central Pomo, see [[#mithun1995|Mithun 1995]]) can be used to convey modality.

==Modal Categories==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

Many different kinds of modal interpretations have been observed and studied, resulting in a variety of typologies. What follows below is one of the many ways that modality has been classified. Only broad categories have been distinguished below: the reader is referred to the main articles and the references for more detailed discussions.

===Realis vs. Irrealis===

The closely related [[realis mood|realis]], [[declarative mood|declarative]], and [[evidential mood]]s refer to situations that actually exist, are claimed to exist, or are inferred to exist. In contrast, [[irrealis mood]]s refer to situations that are not known to exist. Two common irrealis moods are the [[conditional mood]], stating what would happen under a certain condition or conditions (expressed periphrastically in English as ''would'' + main verb), and the [[subjunctive mood]], stating the speaker's preferences for what should occur (such as ''he leave'' in the English ''I demand that he leave'') or hypotheticals (such as English ''If I were to go,....'').

[[Counterfactual conditional#Examples|Counterfactuals]] refer to things that are contrary to the actual situation. In English, counterfactuals can be expressed implicitly in [[If clause|"if"-clauses]] by using a tense form that normally refers to a time prior to the time actually semantically referred to in the ''if''-clause. For example, ''If I knew that, I wouldn't have to ask'' contains the counterfactual ''If I knew'', which refers to the present tense despite the form of the verb, and which denies the proposition "I know that". This contrasts with the construction ''If I know that,...'', which is not a counterfactual because it means that maybe I know it and maybe I don't (or maybe I will know it, and maybe I will not). Likewise, ''If I had known that, I would have gone there'' contains the counterfactual ''If I had known'', denying the proposition that I had known; a note of caution on the above: the [[pluperfect]] verbal construction is sometimes mistakenly confused with the simple past, this is because most of the time the distinction has a very small effect on the semantic interpretation, and the incorrect logic that, through inertia, prior knowledge of X implies present knowledge of X, however this is not universal, (e.g. memory loss), a correct modal statement would look like "prior knowledge of X ''usually'' implies present knowledge of X". as with any subtlety, caution is prescribed.

===Epistemic vs. deontic modality===
{{Main article|Epistemic modality|Deontic modality}}
Epistemic modals are used to indicate the possibility or necessity of some piece of knowledge. It deals with the likelihood of the actualization of the state of affairs. In the epistemic use, modals can be interpreted as indicating inference or some other process of reasoning involved in coming to the conclusion stated in the sentence containing the modal. However, epistemic modals do not necessarily require inference, reasoning, or evidence. One effect of using an epistemic modal (as opposed to not using one) is a general weakening of the speaker's commitment to the truth of the sentence containing the modal. However, it is disputed whether the function of modals is to indicate this weakening of commitment, or whether the weakening is a by-product of some other aspect of the modal's meaning.

Examples of the expression of epistemic modality in English are: ''he might be there'' (low probability, substantial doubt), ''He may be there'' (possibility), ''He should be there by now'' (high probability), and ''He must be there by now'' (certitude, no doubt).

In contrast, [[deontic modality]] is concerned with possibility and necessity in terms of freedom to act (including ability, permission, and duty). In other words, deontic modals state something about the desirability of the actualization of the state of affairs, expressed in varying degrees of obligation. English examples include ''She can go'' (ability), ''You may go'' (permission), ''You should go'' (request), and ''You must go'' (command). In English as in many other languages, some of the same words are used for deontic modality as for epistemic modality, and the meaning is distinguished from context: ''He must be there by now'' (epistemic) versus ''He must be there tomorrow at noon'' (deontic).

==Study methodology==
A lost in the mall experiment is a [[memory implantation]] technique used to demonstrate that [[confabulation]]s about events that never took place, such as having been lost in a shopping mall as a child. It can be created through suggestions made to experimental subjects. It was first developed by Jim Coan, an undergraduate student of psychologist [[Elizabeth Loftus]] at the [[University of Washington]] as support for the claim that it is possible to implant entirely false memories in people. It was developed in the context of a debate about the existence of [[repressed memories]] and false memories (see [[False memory syndrome]]).&lt;ref&gt;Loftus EF, Coan J., Pickrell, JE. Manufacturing false memories using bits of reality. In {{cite book|editor1-last=Reder|editor1-first=Lynne M.|title=Implicit Memory and Metacognition|date=1996|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|isbn=9780805818604|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r8iYAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA195|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coan designed the first lost in the mall experiment as an extra-credit assignment for a course in [[cognitive psychology]]. The professor—Loftus—invited her students to design and execute an experiment implanting false memories in subjects. Coan enlisted his mother, sister and brother as subjects. He assembled booklets containing four short narratives describing childhood events, and instructed them to try to remember as much as possible about each of the four events, and to write down those details over the course of six days. Unbeknownst to the participants, one of the narratives was false; it described Coan's brother getting lost in a shopping mall at around the age of 5, then being rescued by an elderly person and reunited with his family. During the experiment, Coan's brother unwittingly invented several additional details of the false narrative. At the conclusion of the experiment during a tape-recorded debriefing when told that one of the narratives was false, Coan's brother could not identify which one was false and expressed disbelief when told.&lt;ref&gt;Coan, J.A., Lost in a Shopping Mall: An Experience with Controversial Research. ETHICS &amp; BEHAVIOR, 7(3), 271-284&lt;/ref&gt;

Coan later refined the study methodology for his senior thesis, in collaboration with Loftus and graduate student Jacqueline Pickrell.&lt;ref name="Loftus 1995 720–725"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loftus |first=E.F. |authorlink=Elizabeth Loftus |author2=Pickrell JE  |year=1995 |title=The formation of false memories |journal=Psychiatric Annals |volume=25 |url= http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/harnad/Papers/Py104/loftusmem1.pdf |format=pdf |pages=720–725}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their experiment, they adapted the methods Coan had used on his brother in a formal study with 24 participants, 25% of whom reported remembering the false event. The memory for the false event was usually reported to be less clear than the true events, and people generally used more words to describe the true events than the false events. At the end of the study when the participants were told that one of the 4 events was false, some people (5 out of 24) failed to identify the lost in the mall event as the false event and instead picked one of the true events to be false. Loftus calls this study "existence proof" for the phenomenon of false memory creation and suggests that the false memory is formed as a result of the suggested event (being lost in a mall) being incorporated into already existing memories of going to the mall. With the passage of time it becomes harder for people to differentiate between what actually happened and what was imagined and they make memory errors.&lt;ref name="Loftus 1995 720–725"/&gt;

The lost in the mall experiment has been replicated and extended with different ages of subjects.&lt;ref name=pezdek1999&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pezdek |first=K |author2=Hodge, D.  |date=July–August 1999 |title=Planting false childhood memories: The role of event plausibility |journal=Child Development |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=887–895 |doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00064 |jstor=1132249}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 25 percent of the participants not only "remembered" the implanted memory but also filled in the missing details.&lt;ref name="Kolk191"/&gt;

==Criticism of methodology and conclusions==
The Lost in the Mall technique is generally accepted as a memory implantation study that is useful for investigating the effect of suggestions on memory. However some people have argued that this is not generalizable to memories for traumatic events. An article in the journal ''Child Development'' by Pezdek and Hodges described an extension of the experiment. By using the subjects' family members to do the interviewing, their study was able to replicate Loftus' findings that memories of being lost in the mall could be created and were more likely to occur in young children. However, a much smaller number of children reported false memories of another untrue incident: that of a painful and embarrassing [[enema]].&lt;ref name=pezdek1999/&gt; Another article by Kenneth Pope in the ''American Psychologist'' suggested possible confounding variables in the study as well as questioning whether the technique's ability to generate a false memory could be compared with the ability of a therapist to create a pseudomemory of childhood sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pope |first=K. |year=1996 |title=Memory, Abuse, and Science: Questioning Claims About the False Memory Syndrome Epidemic |journal=[[American Psychologist]] |volume=51 |url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=HvMJ8y7hTLwzJKhQcXtBzn5T7hD51pStTy7SkQkzTNz51hB3Shgg!1063769811?docId=96531378 |accessdate=2008-01-31 |pmid=8819364 |issue=9 |pages=957–74 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.51.9.957}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1995, Lynn Crook who had recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse, filed an ethics complaint with the American Psychological Association charging Loftus with misrepresenting Crook's successful recovered memory lawsuit in a media interview with ''Psychology Today'' ("Dispatch from the Memory War").
In an article (1999 in the Journal ''Ethics &amp; Behavior'') two women who had recovered memories of childhood sexual abuse, Lynn Crook and Martha Dean, questioned Loftus' Lost in the Mall-study, arguing that the methods used were unethical and the results not generalizable to real life memories of trauma.&lt;ref name=crook1999&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crook |first=L. |year=1999 |title=Lost in a Shopping Mall—A Breach of Professional Ethics |journal=Ethics &amp; Behavior |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=39–50 |url=http://users.owt.com/crook/memory/ |accessdate=2008-01-18 |doi= 10.1207/s15327019eb0901_3 |last2=Dean |first2=Martha |pmid=11657487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loftus responded to Crook and Dean's criticism pointing to the exaggerations, omissions and errors in Crook and Dean's description of the technique and their mistakes about the study's representation in the media. Loftus made it clear that the Lost in the Mall study and other studies using memory implantation techniques in no way tried to claim that all memories of childhood sexual abuse discovered in therapy are false, they merely try to show how relatively easy it is to manipulate human memory. Loftus also accused Crook of writing the article as part of a long series of efforts to discredit her integrity as a researcher and her work.&lt;ref name=Loftusreply&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loftus |first=E.F. |authorlink=Elizabeth Loftus |title=Lost in the Mall: Misrepresentations and Misunderstandings |journal=Ethics &amp; Behaviour |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=51–60 |url=http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/fall07/brunnquelld/psy8542/Session%2015/Loftus%20-Lost%20in%20the%20Mall%20-%20Misrepresentations%20and%20misubders.pdf |doi=10.1207/s15327019eb0901_4 |year=1999 |pmid=11657488 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619082741/http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/fall07/brunnquelld/psy8542/Session%2015/Loftus%20-Lost%20in%20the%20Mall%20-%20Misrepresentations%20and%20misubders.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Editorial |title=Dispatch from the memory war |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19960501-000001.html |journal=[[Psychology Today]] |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[abstract algebra]], a '''magma''' (or '''groupoid'''; not to be confused with [[groupoid]]s in [[category theory]]) is a basic kind of [[algebraic structure]]. Specifically, a magma consists of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] equipped with a single [[binary operation]]. The binary operation must be [[closure (binary operation)|closed]] by definition but no other properties are imposed.

{{Algebraic structures |Group}}

== History and terminology ==
The term ''groupoid'' was introduced in 1927 by [[Heinrich Brandt]] describing his [[Brandt groupoid]] (translated from the German ''Gruppoid''). The term was then appropriated by B. A. Hausmann and [[Øystein Ore]] (1937)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=B. A. |last=Hausmann |first2=Øystein |last2=Ore |title=Theory of quasi-groups |journal=American Journal of Mathematics |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=983–1004 |year=October 1937 |jstor=2371362 |doi=10.2307/2371362}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense (of a set with a binary operation) used in this article. In a couple of reviews of subsequent papers in [[Zentralblatt]], Brandt strongly disagreed with this overloading of terminology. The Brandt groupoid is a [[groupoid]] in the sense used in category theory, but not in the sense used by Hausmann and Ore. Nevertheless, influential books in semigroup theory, including [[Alfred Hoblitzelle Clifford|Clifford]] and [[G. B. Preston|Preston]] (1961) and [[John Mackintosh Howie|Howie]] (1995) use groupoid in the sense of Hausmann and Ore. Hollings (2014) writes that the term ''groupoid'' is "perhaps most often used in modern mathematics" in the sense given to it in category theory.&lt;ref name="Hollings2014"&gt;{{citation |first=Christopher |last=Hollings |title=Mathematics across the Iron Curtain: A History of the Algebraic Theory of Semigroups |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O9wJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142 |year=2014 |publisher=American Mathematical Society |isbn=978-1-4704-1493-1 |pages=142–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bergman and Hausknecht (1996): "There is no generally accepted word for a set with a not necessarily associative binary operation. The word ''groupoid'' is used by many universal algebraists, but workers in category theory and related areas object strongly to this usage because they use the same word to mean 'category in which all morphisms are invertible'. The term ''magma'' was used by [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]] [Lie Algebras and Lie Groups, 1965]."&lt;ref name="BergmanHausknecht1996"&gt;{{citation |first=George M. |last=Bergman |first2=Adam O. |last2=Hausknecht |title=Cogroups and Co-rings in Categories of Associative Rings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6NnkQs3JBMC&amp;pg=PA61 |year=1996 |publisher=American Mathematical Society |isbn=978-0-8218-0495-7 |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also appears in [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]]'s ''[[Éléments de mathématique]]'', Algèbre, chapitres 1 à 3, 1970.&lt;ref name="Bourbaki1998"&gt;{{citation |first=N. |last=Bourbaki |title=Algebra I: Chapters 1–3 |chapter=Algebraic Structures: §1.1 Laws of Composition: Definition 1 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=STS9aZ6F204C&amp;pg=PA1 |year=1998 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-64243-5 |page=1 |origyear=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

A magma is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''M'' matched with an [[Binary operation|operation]], •, that sends any two [[element (mathematics)|elements]] {{nowrap|''a'', ''b'' ∈ ''M''}} to another element, {{nowrap|''a'' • ''b''}}. The symbol, •, is a general placeholder for a properly defined operation. To qualify as a magma, the set and operation {{nowrap|(''M'', •)}} must satisfy the following requirement (known as the ''magma or closure axiom''):

: For all ''a'', ''b'' in ''M'', the result of the operation {{nowrap|''a'' • ''b''}} is also in ''M''.

And in mathematical notation:
: &lt;math&gt;a,b \in M \implies a \cdot b \in M&lt;/math&gt;.

If • is instead a [[partial operation]], then {{math|''S''}} is called a '''partial magma'''&lt;ref name="Müller-HoissenPallo2012"&gt;{{citation |editor-first=Folkert |editor-last=Müller-Hoissen |editor2-first=Jean Marcel |editor2-last=Pallo |editor3-first=Jim |editor3-last=Stasheff |title=Associahedra, Tamari Lattices and Related Structures: Tamari Memorial Festschrift |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y01d6g5UemQC&amp;pg=PA11 |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-0348-0405-9 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more often a [[partial groupoid]].&lt;ref name="Müller-HoissenPallo2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Silver"&gt;{{citation |editor-first=Ben |editor-last=Silver |title=Nineteen Papers on Algebraic Semigroups |publisher=American Mathematical Society |isbn=0-8218-3115-1 |last=Evseev |first=A. E. |chapter=A survey of partial groupoids |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morphism of magmas ==
A [[morphism]] of magmas is a function, {{nowrap|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}}, mapping magma ''M'' to magma ''N'', that preserves the binary operation:

:''f'' (''x'' •&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; ''y'') = ''f''(''x'') •&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f''(''y'')

where •&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; and •&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the binary operation on ''M'' and ''N'' respectively.

== Notation and combinatorics ==

The magma operation may be applied repeatedly, and in the general, non-associative case, the order matters, which is notated with parentheses. Also, the operation, •, is often omitted and notated by juxtaposition:
: {{math|1= (''a'' • (''b'' • ''c'')) • ''d'' = (''a''(''bc''))''d''}}

A shorthand is often used to reduce the number of parentheses, in which the innermost operations and pairs of parentheses are omitted, being replaced just with juxtaposition, {{math|1=''xy'' • ''z'' = (''x'' • ''y'') • ''z''}}. For example, the above is abbreviated to the following expression, still containing parentheses:
:{{math|1= (''a'' • ''bc'')''d''}}.
A way to avoid completely the use of parentheses is [[prefix notation]], in which the same expression would be written {{math|1= ••''a''•''bcd''}}.  Another way, familiar to programmers, is [[postfix notation]] ([[Reverse Polish notation]]), in which the same expression would be written {{math|1= ''abc''••''d''•}}, in which the order of execution is simply left-to-right (no [[Currying]]).

The set of all possible [[string (computer science)|string]]s consisting of symbols denoting elements of the magma, and sets of balanced parentheses is called the [[Dyck language]].  The total number of different ways of writing {{math|''n''}} applications of the magma operator is given by the [[Catalan number]], {{math|''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.  Thus, for example, {{math|1=''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2}}, which is just the statement that {{math|(''ab'')''c''}} and {{math|''a''(''bc'')}} are the only two ways of pairing three elements of a magma with two operations. Less trivially, {{math|1=''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 5}}: {{math|((''ab'')''c'')''d''}}, {{math|(''a''(''bc''))''d''}}, {{math|(''ab'')(''cd'')}}, {{math|''a''((''bc'')''d'')}}, and {{math|''a''(''b''(''cd''))}}.

There are &lt;math&gt;n^{n^2}&lt;/math&gt; magmas with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements so 1, 1, 16, 19683, 4294967296, ... {{OEIS|A002489}} magmas with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... elements. The corresponding numbers of non-isomorphic magmas are 1, 1, 10, 3330, 178981952, ... {{OEIS|A001329}} and of simultaneously non-isomorphic and non-[[antiisomorphic]] magmas are 1, 1, 7, 1734, 89521056, ... {{OEIS|A001424}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld|urlname=Groupoid|title=Groupoid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free magma ==

A '''free magma''', ''M&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'', on a set, ''X'', is the "most general possible" magma generated by ''X'' (i.e., there are no relations or axioms imposed on the generators; see [[free object]]). It can be described as the set of non-associative words on ''X'' with parentheses retained.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Graduate Algebra: Noncommutative View | page=321 | series=[[Graduate Studies in Mathematics]] | first=Louis Halle | last=Rowen | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=2008 | isbn=0-8218-8408-5 |chapter=Definition 21B.1. |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=8svFC09gGeMC&amp;pg=PA321 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also be viewed, in terms familiar in [[computer science]], as the magma of [[binary tree]]s with leaves labelled by elements of ''X''. The operation is that of joining trees at the root. It therefore has a foundational role in [[syntax]].

A free magma has the [[universal property]] such that, if {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''N''}} is a function from ''X'' to any magma, ''N'', then there is a unique extension of ''f'' to a morphism of magmas, ''f'' ′
: ''f'' ′ : ''M&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''N''.

== Types of magma ==
[[Image:Magma to group2.svg|thumb|right|300px]]
Magmas are not often studied as such; instead there are several different kinds of magma, depending on what axioms the operation is required to satisfy. Commonly studied types of magma include:
;[[Quasigroup]]: A magma where [[division (mathematics)|division]] is always possible
;[[Loop (algebra)|Loop]]: A quasigroup with an [[identity element]]
;[[Semigroup]]: A magma where the operation is [[associative]]
;[[Semilattice]]: A semigroup where the operation is [[commutative]] and [[idempotent]]
;[[Monoid]]: A semigroup with an [[identity element]]
;[[Group (mathematics)|Group]]: A monoid with [[inverse element]]s, or equivalently, an associative loop, or a non-empty associative quasigroup
;[[Abelian group]]: A group where the operation is commutative

Note that each of divisibility and invertibility imply the [[cancellation property]].

{{Buddhism}}

'''Manas-vijnana''' (Skt. "'मानस-विज्ञान"'; '''mānas-vijñāna'''; "mind-knowledge", compare ''[[mantra|man-tra]]'', [[Jnana|jñāna]]) is the seventh of the [[Eight Consciousnesses|eight consciousnesses]] as taught in [[Yogacara]] and [[Zen]] Buddhism, the [[higher consciousness]] or [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive consciousness]] that on the one hand localizes experience through thinking and on the other hand universalizes experience through intuitive perception of the universal mind of [[alayavijnana]]. Manas-vijnana, also known as klista-manas-vijnana or simply manas, is not to be confused with ''manovijnana'' which is the sixth consciousness.

== Overlapping Pali terms for "mind" ==
According to [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], the post-canonical Pali [[atthakatha|commentary]] uses the three terms ''viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a'', ''[[Manas (early Buddhism)|mano]]'' and ''[[citta]]'' as synonyms for the mind sense base (''mana-[[ayatana]]''); however, in the [[Sutta Pitaka]], these three terms are generally contextualized differently:
* '''''Viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a''''' refers to awareness through a specific internal sense base, that is, through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body or mind.  Thus, there are six sense-specific types of ''Viññā{{IAST|ṇ}}a''.  It is also the basis for personal continuity within and across lives.
* '''''[[Manas (early Buddhism)|Manas]]''''' refers to mental "actions" (''kamma''),  as opposed to those actions that are physical or verbal.  It is also the sixth internal sense base (''[[ayatana]]''), that is, the "mind base," cognizing  mental sensa (''dhammā'') as well as sensory information from the physical sense bases.
* '''''[[Citta]]''''' includes the formation of thought, emotion and volition; this is thus the subject of Buddhist mental development (''[[Buddhist meditation|bhava]]''), the mechanism for release.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), pp. 769-70, ''n''. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overlapping Sanskrit terms for "mind" ==
According to [[Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki]] (who uses the term "Manas" rather than "Manas Vijnana" for the seventh consciousness) the [[Lankavatara Sutra]] presents the Zen view of the [[Eight Consciousnesses]] rather than the Yogacara view. In his introduction to his translation of the Lankavatara Sutra he clarifies the distinction between the overlapping terms:

:What may be termed Buddhist psychology in the Laṅkā consists in the analysis of [[mind]], that is, in the classification of the Vijñānas. To understand thus the psychology of Buddhism properly the knowledge of these terms is necessary: citta, manas, vijñāna, manovijñāna, and ālayavijñāna.
 
:To begin with [[vijnana|Vijñāna]]. Vijñāna is composed of the prefix vi, meaning "to divide", and the root jñā which means "to perceive", "to know". Thus, Vijñāna is the faculty of distinguishing or discerning or judging. When an object is presented before the eye, it is perceived and judged as a red apple or a piece of white linen; the faculty of doing this is called eye-vijñāna. In the same way, there are ear-vijñāna for sound, nose-vijñāna for odour, tongue-vijñāna for taste, body-vijñāna for touch, and thought-vijñāna (manovijñāna) for ideas—altogether six forms of Vijñāna for distinguishing the various aspects of world external or internal.
 
:Of these six Vijñānas, the Manojivñāna is the most important as it is directly related to an inner faculty known as Manas. Manas roughly corresponds to mind as an organ of thought, but in fact it is more than that, for it is also a strong power of attaching itself to the result of thinking. The latter may even be considered subordinate to this power of attachment. The Manas first wills, then it discriminates to judge; to judge is to divide, and this dividing ends in viewing existence dualistically. Hence the Manas' tenacious attachment to the dualistic interpretation of existence. Willing and thinking are inextricably woven into the texture of Manas.
 
:[[Citta]] comes from the root cit, "to think", but in the Laṅkā the derivation is made from the root ci, "to pile up", "to arrange in order". The Citta is thus a storehouse where the seeds of all thoughts and deeds are accumulated and stored up. The Citta, however, has a double sense, general and specific. When it is used in the general sense it means "mind", "mentation", "ideas", including the activities of Manas and Manovijñāna, and also of the Vijñānas; while specifically it is a synonym of Ālayavijñāna in its relative aspects, and distinguishable from all the rest of the mental faculties. When, however, it is used in the form of Citta-mātra, Mind-only, it acquires still another connotation. We can say that Citta appears here in its highest possible sense, for it is then neither simply mentation nor intellection, nor perception as a function of consciousness. It is identifiable with the Ālaya in its absolute aspect. This will become clearer later on.
 
:[[alayavijnana|Ālayavijñāna]] is ālaya+vijñāna, and ālaya is a store where things are hoarded for future use. The Citta as a cumulative faculty is thus identified with the Ālayavijñāna. Strictly speaking, the Ālaya is not a Vijñāna, has no discerning power in it; it indiscriminately harbours all that is poured into it through the channel of the Vijñānas. The Ālaya is perfectly neutral, indifferent, and does not offer to give judgments.

== Various descriptions of "Manas-vijnana" ==
* One of the primary functions of Manas-vijnana is to perceive the subjective position of the [[store consciousness]]  and erroneously regard it as one's own [[Ego (religion)|ego]], thereby creating ego [[Upādāna|attachment]].
* The basic nature of Manas-vijnana is that of [[thought]].
* There is a difference between the "thought" of this seventh consciousness, Manas-vijnana, and the sixth consciousness "thought" of cognition.
* Not consciously controllable, Manas-vijnana is said to be a mind of a realm that gives rise to contradiction of conscious decisions, and to incessant self-love.
* Manas-vijnana can be described as "the consciousness which sees the limits of human variation from within".
* Manas-vijnana consciousness is also described as the place where good and evil are eternally accumulated.

A '''neural correlate''' of a content of [[experience]] is any bodily component, such as an electro-neuro-biological state or the state assumed by some [[biophysics|biophysical]] subsystem of the brain, whose presence necessarily and regularly correlates with such a specific content of [[experience]].

When the full [[ontology|ontological]] consistence or build-up of the reality variably called [[mind]], [[soul]], [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]], or existentiality is called "[[consciousness]]" and [[Philosophy of mind|deemed to]] exclusively consist in mental contents associated with and at least partly generated by the [[Human brain|brain]] organ, the notion of [[neural correlates of consciousness|neural correlate of consciousness]]  is commonly employed. When it is only the sensations that are held to be produced by brain states, whether exclusively or not (''e.g.'', when sensations are also deemed capable of being generated by the mind reacting against itself), then the notion of '''neural correlate of a content of experience''' is commonly utilized. A mid-way concept, not always clarified, is that of a neural correlate encompassing the production of every mental content but not of consciousness itself.

== Conceptual frameworks using the notion == 
The notion of a '''neural correlate''' of a mental state is an important concept for [[materialists]], those [[List of philosophers of mind|philosophers of mind]] and researchers who believe that all mental states are equivalent to brain states. According to strict [[materialists]], all properties credited to the [[mind]], including [[consciousness]], [[emotion]], [[beliefs]], and [[motivation|desires]] have direct neural correlates.  This is also a pragmatic view adopted by a number of scholars. This view frequently depends on considering [[mind]]s exclusively as sentient knots {{citation needed|reason=This concept needs more developement|date=April 2015}} in [[nature]]'s causal net.

Instead, other [[neuroscientist]]s find minds inaugurating [[Causality|causal actions]] in nature, rather than solely being able of merely continuing previously initiated causal sequences. These neuroscientists thus describe minds as percipient agencies, the mind's very agency or causal aptitude being deemed extraneous to any neural correlate.

Still, some neurobiologists consider reasons to further assume that rememberings are not engraved in brain tissue but retained by the very mind, which thereby transforms itself in a way different from the time changes underwent by non-minds. These later neuroscientists consider that there is no neural correlate for [[episodic memory|episodal]] and some other memories, but that the mind moves the brain state (like as it may also inaugurate a finger movement) in such a way as to produce a brain state which the mind then reacts to by fleshing its selected memory again ([[Husserl]]'s ''Einfüllung''), re-imagining it. This view develops a notion by [[Aristotle]] and, again, makes no use of the notion of neural correlate for certain experiences, namely in regard to complex mental contents. It only admits neural correlates for the mind's elementary sensational reactions, which are called "intonations" (following neurobiologist Christfried Jakob, 1866-1956).

The concept of a neural correlate only encompassing the production of intonations occurs in a variety of researchers on different neurobiological traditions, including [[Scholasticism]] (see ''References''). Rather, the concept of a neural correlate encompassing the production of every mental content occurs only in a specific conceptual line of theoretical [[neuroscience]], characterized by the following features:

* Minds are sometimes viewed as incapable of positing causal acts upon self-initiated, internal modifications. This posits [[observation|observer]]s in nature as [[epiphenomenon|epiphenomenal]], unable to introduce perturbations, even less to absolutely inaugurate causal series.
* Mental contents are considered stand-alone realities, similar to any other physical reality as apples, rocks, or molecules. Such a line of opinion does not admit a difference in level between non-mental things and mental contents, namely that while things as apples and rocks do not belong with any other natural reality and thus are capable of standing alone, mental contents rather belong with a particular mind or, as sometimes called, a particular existentiality: e.g., this red is in Jane's experience whereas that red (which might be sensationally identical to Jane's) is John's experience and not Jane's at all. This distinctive feature of the contents of experience is dismissed (see Szirko's article cited in ''References''), so that the physical condition of mental contents is deemed identical to the stand-alone condition of apples and rocks.
* The relationship of a mind with the body in which it finds itself is [[plato]]nistically portrayed, so that any a mind might have found itself in any a brain-body system, like as a steerman may find himself in any ship that he chances to steer. Therefore this line of theoretical [[neuroscience]] does not admit that every mind and its particular body could intrinsically make a unity besides and apart from their causal interactions, which interactions, inasmuch as the mind is also deemed [[epiphenomenon|epiphenomenal]], reduce to bodily influences upon the mind's experiences or states.
* As a consequence, the connections of a mind and the body in which it finds itself are deemed to exclusively be of [[Causality|causal-efficient]] nature, similar to the energy supplied for a domestic appliance to function. This view entails that minds are no more than the mental contents which may be causally generated in them by their respective brains. Sentience (minds' intonability), [[semovience]] (minds' capability of inaugurating [[Causality|efficient causal actions]] on internal forces) and circumstantiation (every mind's finding itself in not another body) are thus viewed as highly problematic and their research is usually relegated.

In the conceptual line characterized by these four features, and in recent years, papers have been published on the neural correlates of [[awareness]], [[emotions]], and [[decision making]]. [[Francis Crick]] wrote a popular book "The Astonishing Hypothesis" whose thesis is that the neural correlate for consciousness lies in our nerve cells and their associated molecules.  Crick and his collaborator [[Christof Koch]] have sought to avoid philosophical debates that are associated with the study of consciousness, by emphasizing the search for "correlation" and not "causation".

There is much room for disagreement about the nature of this correlation (''e.g.'', does it require synchronous spikes of neurons in different regions of the brain? Is the co-activation of frontal or parietal areas necessary?). The philosopher [[David Chalmers]] maintains that a neural correlate of consciousness, unlike other correlates such as for memory, will fail to offer a satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon.

== Laboratory studies ==

Neurophysiological studies in animals provided some insights on the neural correlates of conscious behavior. [[Vernon Mountcastle]], in the early 1960s, set up to study this set of problems, which he termed "the Mind/Brain problem", by studying the neural basis of perception in the [[somatic sensory system]]. His labs at Johns Hopkins were among the first, along with Edward V.Evarts at NIH, to record neural activity from behaving monkeys. Struck with the elegance of SS Stevens approach of magnitude estimation, Mountcastle's group discovered three different modalities of somatic sensation shared one cognitive attribute: in all cases the firing rate of peripheral neurons was linearly related to the strength of the percept elicited. More recently, Ken H. Britten, William T. Newsome, and C. Daniel Salzman have shown that in [[Visual cortex#V5.2FMT|area MT]] of monkeys, neurons respond with variability that suggests they are the basis of decision making about direction of motion. They first showed that neuronal rates are predictive of decisions using signal detection theory, and then that stimulation of these neurons could predictably bias the decision. Such studies were followed by Ranulfo Romo in the somatic sensory system, to confirm, using a different percept and brain area, that a small number of neurons in one brain area underlie perceptual decisions.

Other lab groups have followed Mountcastle's seminal work relating cognitive variables to neuronal activity with more complex cognitive tasks. Although monkeys cannot talk about their perceptions, behavioral tasks have been created in which animals made nonverbal reports, for example by producing hand movements. Many of these studies employ perceptual illusions as a way to dissociate sensations (''i.e.'', the sensory information that the brain receives) from perceptions (''i.e.'', how the consciousness interprets them). Neuronal patterns that represent perceptions rather than merely sensory input are interpreted as reflecting the neuronal correlate of consciousness.

Using such design, [[Nikos Logothetis]] and colleagues discovered perception-reflecting neurons in the temporal lobe. They created an experimental situation in which conflicting images were presented to different eyes (''i.e.'', [[binocular rivalry]]). Under such conditions, human subjects report bistable percepts: they perceive alternatively one or the other image. Logothetis and colleagues trained the monkeys to report with their arm movements which image they perceived. Temporal lobe neurons in Logothetis experiments often reflected what the monkeys' perceived. Neurons with such properties were less frequently observed in the primary visual cortex that corresponds to relatively early stages of visual processing. Another set of experiments using binocular rivalry in humans showed that certain layers of the cortex can be excluded as candidates of the neural correlate of consciousness. Logothetis and colleagues switched the images between eyes during the percept of one of the images. Surprisingly the percept stayed stable. This means that the conscious percept stayed stable and at the same time the primary input to layer 4, which is the input layer, in the visual cortex changed. Therefore layer 4 can not be a part of the neural correlate of consciousness. [[Attention versus memory in prefrontal cortex|Mikhail Lebedev]] and their colleagues observed a similar phenomenon in monkey prefrontal cortex. In their experiments monkeys reported the perceived direction of visual stimulus movement (which could be an illusion) by making eye movements. Some prefrontal cortex neurons represented actual and some represented perceived displacements of the stimulus. Observation of perception related neurons in prefrontal cortex is consistent with the theory of [[Christof Koch]] and [[Francis Crick]] who postulated that neural correlate of consciousness resides in prefrontal cortex. Proponents of distributed neuronal processing may likely dispute the view that consciousness has a precise localization in the brain.

== Of cognitive variables ==

In addition to neural correlate of consciousness in general, much progress has been made in elucidating neural correlates of specific cognitive variables.  Thus, Earl Miller and colleagues discovered prefrontal cortex neurons that represent perceptual categories (cats versus dogs in their experiments). The work of Richard Andersen, Steven Wise, Carl Olson, Jun Tanji, Apostolos Georgopoulos and other neuroscientists has illuminated neuronal correlates of [[motor planning]], selective visual attention, motor sequences and spatial reference frames in which these entities are represented by brain cells. The progress in understanding neuronal correlates of motor planning has led to the creation of [[brain-machine interface]] so, the devices that translate neuronal activity into purposeful commands to artificial actuators.

A large number of studies have addressed the problem of neural correlates of mental representations in human subjects. For example,  functional neuroimaging have shown that parts of the cortex are still active in vegetative patients that are presumed to be unconscious (Laureys, Trends Cogn Sci, 2005, 9:556-559). However, these areas appear to be functionally disconnected from associative cortical areas whose activity is needed for awareness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15894">'''Newton's law of cooling''' states that ''the rate of [[heat]] loss of a body is directly proportional to the difference in the [[temperature]]s between the body and its surroundings provided the temperature difference is small and the nature of radiating surface remains same.'' As such, it is equivalent to a statement that the [[heat transfer coefficient]], which mediates between heat losses and temperature differences, is a constant. This condition is generally true in [[thermal conduction]] (where it is guaranteed by [[Thermal conduction#Fourier.27s law|Fourier's law]]), but it is often only approximately true in conditions of [[convective heat transfer]], where a number of physical processes make effective heat transfer coefficients somewhat dependent on temperature differences. Finally, in the case of heat transfer by [[thermal radiation]], Newton's law of cooling is not true.

[[Sir Isaac Newton]] did not originally state his law in the above form in 1701, when it was originally formulated. Rather, using today's terms, Newton noted after some mathematical manipulation that ''the rate of temperature change'' of a body is proportional to the difference in temperatures between the body and its surroundings. This final simplest version of the law given by Newton himself, was partly due to confusion in Newton's time between the concepts of heat and temperature, which would not be fully disentangled until much later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paginas.fisica.uson.mx/laura.yeomans/tc/Sci-Edu-Springer-2010.pdf History of Newton's cooling law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614122639/http://paginas.fisica.uson.mx/laura.yeomans/tc/Sci-Edu-Springer-2010.pdf |date=2015-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When stated in terms of temperature differences, Newton's law (with several further simplifying assumptions, such as a low [[Biot number]] and temperature-independent heat capacity) results in a simple differential equation for temperature-difference as a function of time. This equation has a solution that specifies a simple negative exponential rate of temperature-difference decrease, over time. This characteristic time function for temperature-difference behavior, is also associated with Newton's law of cooling.

== Relationship to mechanism of cooling==
Convection-cooling is sometimes called "Newton's law of cooling." This use is based on a work by Isaac Newton published anonymously as "Scala graduum Caloris. Calorum Descriptiones &amp; signa." in ''Philosophical Transactions'', 1701.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=x8NeAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA824#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 824]&amp;ndash;829; 
ed. Joannes Nichols, ''Isaaci Newtoni Opera quae exstant omnia'', vol. 4 (1782), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz2FzJqaJMUC&amp;pg=PA403 403]&amp;ndash;407.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases where the [[heat transfer coefficient]] is independent, or relatively independent, of the temperature difference between object and environment, Newton's law is followed. This independence is sometimes the case, but is not guaranteed to be so. The heat transfer coefficient is often relatively independent of temperature in purely conduction-type cooling, but becomes a function of the temperature in classical natural convective heat transfer. In this case, Newton's law only approximates the result when the temperature changes are relatively small. Newton himself realized this limitation.

A correction to Newton's law concerning larger temperature differentials was made in 1817 by [[Pierre Louis Dulong|Dulong]] and [[Alexis Thérèse Petit|Petit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the Inductive Sciences from the Earliest to the Present Times|last=Whewell|first=William|year=1866}}&lt;/ref&gt; (These men are better-known for their formulation of the [[Dulong–Petit law]] concerning the molar specific heat capacity of a crystal.)

Another situation with temperature-dependent transfer coefficient is [[Thermal radiation|radiative heat transfer]], which also does not obey Newton's law.

== Heat transfer version of the law ==

The heat-transfer version of Newton's law, which (as noted) requires a constant heat transfer coefficient, states that ''the rate of heat loss of a body is proportional to the difference in temperatures between the body and its surroundings.''

The rate of heat transfer in such circumstances is derived below:&lt;ref&gt;Louis C. Burmeister, (1993) “Convective Heat Transfer”, 2nd ed. Publisher Wiley-Interscience, p 107 {{ISBN|0-471-57709-X}}, 9780471577096&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's cooling law in convection is a restatement of the differential equation given by [[Fourier's law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;{ \frac{d Q}{d t} = h \cdot A \cdot (  T(t)-T_{\text{env}}) = h \cdot A \Delta T(t)\quad }&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the thermal energy (SI unit: [[joule]])
:&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the [[heat transfer coefficient]] (assumed independent of T here) (SI unit: W/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; K))
:&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the heat transfer surface area (SI unit: m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of the object's surface and interior (since these are the same in this approximation) (SI unit: K)
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\text{env}}&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of the environment; i.e. the temperature suitably far from the surface (SI unit: K)
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T(t)= T(t) - T_{\text{env}} &lt;/math&gt; is the time-dependent thermal gradient between environment and object (SI unit: K)

The heat transfer coefficient '''h''' depends upon physical properties of the fluid and the physical situation in which convection occurs. Therefore, a single usable heat transfer coefficient (one that does not vary significantly across the temperature-difference ranges covered during cooling and heating) must be derived or found experimentally for every system that can be analyzed using the presumption that Newton's law will hold.

Formulas and correlations are available in many references to calculate heat transfer coefficients for typical configurations and fluids.  For laminar flows, the heat transfer coefficient is rather low compared to [[Turbulence|turbulent flows]]; this is due to turbulent flows having a thinner stagnant fluid film layer on the heat transfer surface.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engineersedge.com/heat_transfer/convection.htm  Engineers Edge, 2009, “Convection Heat Transfer”,Accessed 20/03/09&lt;/ref&gt; However, note that Newton's law breaks down if the flows should transition between laminar or turbulent flow, since this will change the heat transfer coefficient '''h''' which is assumed constant in solving the equation.

=== The Biot number ===
{{main|Biot number}}
The Biot number, a dimensionless quantity, is defined for a body as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Bi} = \frac{h L_C}{\ k_b}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*h = film coefficient or [[heat transfer coefficient]] or convective heat transfer coefficient
*L&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = [[characteristic length]], which is commonly defined as the volume of the body divided by the surface area of the body, such that &lt;math&gt;
\mathit{L_C} = \frac{V_{\rm body}}{A_{\rm surface}}
&lt;/math&gt;
*k&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = [[Thermal conductivity]] of the body

The physical significance of Biot number can be understood by imagining the heat flow from a hot metal sphere suddenly immersed in a pool, to the surrounding fluid. The heat flow experiences two resistances: the first at the surface of the sphere, and the second within the solid metal (which is influenced by both the size and composition of the sphere). The ratio of these resistances is the dimensionless Biot number.

If the thermal resistance of the fluid/sphere interface exceeds that thermal resistance offered by the interior of the metal sphere, the Biot number will be less than one. For systems where it is much less than one, the interior of the sphere may be presumed always to have the same temperature, although this temperature may be changing, as heat passes into the sphere from the surface. The equation to describe this change in (relatively uniform) temperature inside the object, is the simple exponential one described in Newton's law of cooling expressed in terms of temperature difference (see below).

In contrast, the metal sphere may be large, causing the characteristic length to increase to the point that the Biot number is larger than one. In this case, thermal gradients within the sphere become important, even though the sphere material is a good conductor. Equivalently, if the sphere is made of a thermally insulating (poorly conductive) material, such as wood or styrofoam, the interior resistance to heat flow will exceed that of the fluid/sphere boundary, even with a much smaller sphere. In this case, again, the Biot number will be greater than one.

Values of the Biot number smaller than 0.1 imply that the heat conduction inside the body is much faster than the heat convection away from its surface, and temperature [[gradient]]s are negligible inside of it.  This can indicate the applicability (or inapplicability) of certain methods of solving transient heat transfer problems.  For example, a Biot number less than 0.1 typically indicates less than 5% error will be present when assuming a [[lumped-capacitance model]] of transient heat transfer (also called lumped system analysis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

This leads to a simple first-order differential equation which describes [[heat transfer]] in these systems.

Having a Biot number smaller than 0.1 labels a substance as "thermally thin," and temperature can be assumed to be constant throughout the material's volume. The opposite is also true: A Biot number greater than 0.1 (a "thermally thick" substance) indicates that one cannot make this assumption, and more complicated heat transfer equations for "transient heat conduction" will be required to describe the time-varying and non-spatially-uniform temperature field within the material body. Analytic methods for handling these problems, which may exist for simple geometric shapes and uniform material [[thermal conductivity]], are described in the article on the [[heat equation]].

== Rate-of-change of temperature-difference version of the law ==

As noted in the section above, accurate formulation for temperatures may require analysis based on changing heat transfer coefficients at different temperatures, a situation frequently found in free-convection situations, and which precludes accurate use of Newton's law.

As noted above, Newton's law behavior when stated in terms of ''temperature change'' in the body, also requires that internal heat conduction within the object be large in comparison to the loss/gain of heat by surface transfer (conduction and/or convection), which is the condition where the Biot number is less than about 0.1. This allows the presumption of a single "temperature" inside the body (as a function of time) to make sense, as otherwise the body would have many different temperatures inside it, at any one time. This single temperature will generally change exponentially, as time progresses (see below).

Assumption of rapid internal conduction also allows use of the so-called [[lumped capacitance model]]. In this model, the amount of thermal energy in the body is calculated by assuming a constant [[heat capacity]] and thus thermal energy in the body is assumed to be a linear function of the body's temperature.

=== Temperature function-of-time solution in terms of object heat capacity ===

Given that the body is treated as a lumped capacitance thermal energy reservoir with a &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; (total thermal energy content) which is proportional to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; (simple total [[heat capacity]]) and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; (the temperature of the body), then &lt;math&gt;Q = C T&lt;/math&gt;.  It is expected that the system will experience [[exponential decay]] in the temperature difference of body and surroundings as a function of time. This is proven in the following sections:

From the definition of heat capacity &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; comes the relation &lt;math&gt;\textstyle C = \frac{dQ}{dT}&lt;/math&gt;. Differentiating this equation with regard to time gives the identity (valid so long as temperatures in the object are uniform at any given time):  

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dQ}{dt}  = C \, \frac{dT}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;. 

This expression may be used to replace &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dQ}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; in the first equation which begins this section, above. Then, if &lt;math&gt;T(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of such a body at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm env}&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of the environment around the body:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dT(t)}{dt} = - r (T(t) - T_{\mathrm{env}}) = - r \Delta T(t)\quad &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r = \frac{hA}{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant characteristic of the system, which must be in units of &lt;math&gt;\text{time}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, and is therefore sometimes expressed in terms of a characteristic [[time constant]] &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; given by: 

:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{1}{\tau} = - \frac{dT(t)}{dt}\frac{1}{\Delta T}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Thus, in thermal systems, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \tau = \frac{C}{hA}&lt;/math&gt;. (The total [[heat capacity]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of a system may be further represented by its mass-[[specific heat capacity]] &lt;math&gt;c_P&lt;/math&gt; multiplied by its mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, so that the time constant &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is also given by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{m\, c_P}{hA}&lt;/math&gt;).

The solution of this differential equation, by standard methods of integration and substitution of boundary conditions, gives:

: &lt;math&gt; T(t) = T_{\mathrm{env}} + (T(0) - T_{\mathrm{env}}) \ e^{-r t}. \quad &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt; \Delta T(t)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt; T(t) - T_{\mathrm{env}}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \Delta T(0)\quad &lt;/math&gt; is the initial temperature difference at time 0, then the Newtonian solution is written as:

: &lt;math&gt; \Delta T(t) = \Delta T(0) \ e^{-r t} = \Delta T(0) \ e^{-t/\tau}. \quad &lt;/math&gt;

This same solution is more immediately apparent if the initial differential equation is written in terms of &lt;math&gt;\Delta T(t)&lt;/math&gt;, as a single function of time to be found, or "solved for."

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dT(t)}{dt} = \frac{d\Delta T(t)}{dt} = - \frac{1}{\tau} \Delta T(t)\quad &lt;/math&gt;.

In [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]], a '''notation''' is a [[system]] of graphics or [[symbol]]s, [[Character_(symbol)|character]]s and abbreviated [[Expression (language)|expression]]s, used (for example) in [[Artistic disciplines|artistic]] and [[scientific discipline]]s to represent technical facts and quantities by [[Convention (norm)|convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZPQVuSgDAkC&amp;lpg=PT337&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PT337 | title=Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | author=Crystal, David | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/notation | title=Notation | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica | work=[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] | accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a notation is a collection of related symbols that are each given an [[arbitrary]] meaning, created to facilitate [[structured communication]] within a [[domain knowledge]] or [[field of study]].

Standard notations refer to general agreements in the way things are written or denoted. The term is generally used in technical and scientific areas of study like [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]], but can also be seen in areas like [[business]], [[economics]] and [[music]].

==Written communication==
* Phonographic [[writing systems]], by definition, use symbols to represent components of auditory language, i.e. [[speech]], which in turn refers to things or ideas. The two main kinds of phonographic notational system are the [[alphabet]] and the [[syllabary]]. Some written languages are more consistent in their correlation of written symbols (or [[grapheme]]s) with sound (or [[phoneme]]s), and are therefore considered to have better [[phonemic orthography]].
* Ideographic writing, by definition, refers to things or ideas independently of their pronunciation in any language. Some ideographic systems are also [[pictogram]]s that convey meaning through their pictorial resemblance to a physical object.

===Biology and medicine===
* [[Nucleic acid notation]]
* [[Systems Biology Graphical Notation|Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN)]]&lt;!--[Doesn't clarify/assist?:], orthogonal notations for ''Process Descriptions'', ''Entity Relationships'', and ''Activity Flows''--&gt;

===Chemistry===
* [[Chemical formula]]s are a way of expressing information about the atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound, e.g. {{chem|H|2|O}} or {{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}}

===Computing===

In [[metaphysics]], '''object-oriented ontology''' ('''OOO''') is a 21st-century [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]-influenced school of thought that rejects the privileging of human existence over the existence of nonhuman objects.&lt;ref name="Harman_2002_2"&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2002|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to what it calls the "anthropocentrism" of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] [[Copernican Revolution (metaphor)|Copernican Revolution]], as accepted by most other current metaphysics, in which [[phenomenal]] objects are said to conform to the mind of the subject and, in turn, become products of human cognition.&lt;ref name="bryant1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Levi|title=Onticology–A Manifesto for Object-Oriented Ontology, Part 1|url=http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2010/01/12/object-oriented-ontology-a-manifesto-part-i/|work=Larval Subjects|accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Object-oriented ontology maintains that objects exist independently (as Kantian [[noumena]]) of human perception and are not ontologically exhausted by their relations with humans or other objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2002|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for object-oriented ontologists, all relations, including those between nonhumans, distort their related objects in the same basic manner as human consciousness and exist on an equal footing with one another.&lt;ref name="harman1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harman|first=Graham|title=Guerrilla Metaphysics: Phenomenology and the Carpentry of Things|year=2005|publisher=Open Court|location=Peru, Illinois|isbn=0-8126-9456-2|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Object-oriented ontology is often viewed as a subset of [[speculative realism]], a contemporary school of thought that criticizes the post-Kantian reduction of philosophical enquiry to a correlation between thought and being, such that the reality of anything outside of this correlation is unknowable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bryant|Harman|Srnicek|2011|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Object-oriented ontology predates speculative realism, however, and makes distinct claims about the nature and equality of object relations to which not all speculative realists agree. The term "object-oriented philosophy" was coined by [[Graham Harman]], the movement's founder, in his 1999 doctoral dissertation "Tool-Being: Elements in a Theory of Objects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harman|first=Graham|title=Brief SR/OOO Tutorial|url=http://doctorzamalek2.wordpress.com/2010/07/23/brief-srooo-tutorial/|work=Object-Oriented Philosophy|accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bogost"&gt;Bogost's "Understanding the 'Experience' of Objects," in: ''Humanistic Perspectives in a Technological World'', ed. Richard Utz, Valerie B. Johnson, and Travis Denton (Atlanta: School of Literature, Media, and Communication, Georgia Institute of Technology, 2014), pp. 69-71, provides a quick general definition.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Levi Bryant]] rephrased Harman's original designation as "object-oriented ontology", giving the movement its current name.

==Founding of the movement==

The term "object-oriented philosophy” was coined by speculative philosopher Graham Harman in his 1999 doctoral dissertation "Tool-Being: Elements in a Theory of Objects" (later revised and published as ''Tool-Being: Heidegger and the Metaphysics of Objects'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Harman, Heideggerian ''[[Heideggerian terminology|Zuhandenheit]]'', or readiness-to-hand, refers to the withdrawal of objects from human perception into a reality that cannot be manifested by practical or theoretical action.&lt;ref name="Harman_2002_1"&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2002|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthering this idea, Harman contends that when objects withdraw in this way, they distance themselves from other objects, as well as humans.&lt;ref name="Harman_2002_2"/&gt; Resisting pragmatic interpretations of Heidegger's thought, then, Harman is able to propose an object-oriented account of metaphysical substances. Following the publication of Harman's early work, several scholars from varying fields began employing object-oriented principles in their own work. Levi Bryant began what he describes as "a very intense philosophical email exchange" with Harman, over the course of which Bryant became convinced of the credibility of object-oriented thought.&lt;ref name="Harman_2002_2"/&gt;  Bryant subsequently coined the term "object-oriented ontology" in 2009 to distinguish those ontologies committed to an account of being composed of discrete beings from Harman's object-oriented philosophy, thus marking a difference between object-oriented philosophy (OOP) and object-oriented ontology (OOO).&lt;ref&gt;Graham Harman, "Series Editor's Preface", in Levi R. Bryant, ''Onto-Cartography:  An Ontology of Machines and Media'', IX.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic principles==

While object-oriented philosophers reach different conclusions, they share common precepts, including a critique of anthropocentrism and correlationism and a rejection of "preservation of finitude", "withdrawal", and philosophies that undermine or "overmine" objects.

===Rejection of anthropocentrism===

Anthropocentrism is the privileging of humans as "subjects" over and against nonhuman beings as "objects". The widespread tendency frequently limits attributes such as mind, autonomy, moral agency, reason, and the like to humans, while contrasting all other beings as variations of "object", or things obeying deterministic laws, impulses, stimuli, instincts, and so on. Beginning with Kant's epistemology, modern philosophers began articulating a ''transcendent'' anthropocentrism, whereby the Kantian argument that objects are unknowable outside of the imposed, distorting categories of the human mind in turn shores up discourses wherein objects frequently become effectively reduced to mere products of human cognition.&lt;ref name="bryant1"/&gt; In contrast to Kant's view, object-oriented philosophers maintain that objects exist independently of human perception, and that nonhuman object relations distort their related objects in the same fundamental manner as human consciousness. Thus, all object relations, human and nonhuman, are said to exist on equal ontological footing with one another.&lt;ref name="harman1"/&gt;

===Critique of correlationism&lt;!--'Correlationism' redirects here--&gt;===

Related to 'anthropocentrism', object-oriented thinkers reject '''correlationism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, which the French philosopher [[Quentin Meillassoux]] defines as "the idea according to which we only ever have access to the correlation between thinking and being, and never to either term considered apart from the other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meillassoux|first=Quentin|title=After Finitude|year=2008|publisher=Continuum|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-1-4411-7383-6|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because object-oriented ontology is the realist philosophy, it stands in contradistinction to the anti-realist trajectory of correlationism, which restricts philosophical understanding to the correlation of being with thought by disavowing any reality external to this correlation as inaccessible, and, in this way, fails to escape the ontological reification of human experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coffield|first=Kris|title=Interview: Graham Harman|url=http://fracturedpolitics.com/2011/06/26/interview-graham-harman.aspx|work=Fractured Politics|accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejection of undermining and "overmining"===

Object-oriented thought holds that there are two principal strategies for devaluing the philosophical import of objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2011|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, one can undermine objects by claiming that they are an effect or manifestation of a deeper, underlying substance or force.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2011|pp=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, one can "overmine" objects by either an idealism which holds that there is nothing beneath what appears in the mind or, as in [[social constructionism]], by positing no independent reality outside of language, discourse or power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2011|pp=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dar.aucegypt.edu/handle/10526/3466|title=Undermining, overmining, and duomining: a critique|first=Harman,|last=Graham|date=28 March 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Object-oriented philosophy rejects both undermining and "overmining".

===Preservation of finitude===

Unlike other speculative realisms, object-oriented ontology maintains the concept of finitude, whereby relation to an object cannot be translated into direct and complete knowledge of an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harman|first=Graham|title=Quentin Meillassoux: Philosophy in the Making|year=2011|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-7486-4080-5|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since all object relations distort their related objects, every relation is said to be an act of translation, with the caveat that no object can perfectly translate another object into its own nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bryant|Harman|Srnicek|2011|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Object-oriented ontology does not restrict finitude to humanity, however, but extends it to all objects as an inherent limitation of relationality.

===Withdrawal===

Object-oriented ontology holds that objects are independent not only of other objects, but also from the qualities they animate at any specific spatiotemporal location. Accordingly, objects cannot be exhausted by their relations with humans or other objects in theory or practice, meaning that the reality of objects is always present-at-hand.&lt;ref name="Harman_2002_1"/&gt; The retention by an object of a reality in excess of any relation is known as ''withdrawal''.

==Metaphysics of Graham Harman==

In ''Tool-Being: Heidegger and the Metaphysics of Objects'', Graham Harman interprets the tool-analysis contained in [[Martin Heidegger|Martin Heidegger's]] ''Being and Time'' as inaugurating an ontology of objects themselves, rather than the valorization of practical action or networks of signification.&lt;ref name="Harman_2002_1"/&gt; According to Harman, Heideggerian ''Zuhandenheit'', or readiness-to-hand, indicates the withdrawal of objects from both practical and theoretical action, such that objectcal{{clarify|date=January 2018}} reality cannot be exhausted by either practical usage or theoretical investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2002|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harman further contends that objects withdraw not just from human interaction, but also from other objects. He maintains:

{{quote| If the human perception of a house or a tree is forever haunted by some hidden surplus in the things that never becomes present, the same is true of the sheer causal interaction between rocks or raindrops. Even inanimate things only unlock each other's realities to a minimal extent, reducing one another to caricatures...even if rocks are not sentient creatures, they never encounter one another in their deepest being, but only ''as present-at-hand''; it is only Heidegger's confusion of two distinct senses of the as-structure that prevents this strange result from being accepted.&lt;ref name="Harman_2002_2"/&gt; }}

From this, Harman concludes that the primary site of ontological investigation is objects and relations, instead of the post-Kantian emphasis on the human-world correlate. Moreover, this holds true for all entities, be they human, nonhuman, natural, or artificial, leading to the downplayment of ''dasein'' as an ontological priority. In its place, Harman proposes a concept of substances that are irreducible to both material particles and human perception, and "exceed every relation into which they might enter".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2002|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coupling Heidegger's tool-analysis with the phenomenological insights of [[Edmund Husserl]], Harman introduces two types of objects: ''real objects'' and ''sensual objects''. Real objects are objects that withdraw from all experience, whereas sensual objects are those that exist only in experience.&lt;ref name="Harman_2011_49"&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2011|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Harman suggests two kinds of qualities: ''sensual qualities'', or those found in experience, and ''real qualities'', which are accessed through intellectual probing.&lt;ref name="Harman_2011_49"/&gt; Pairing sensual and real objects and qualities yields the following framework:

* '''Sensual Object/Sensual Qualities''': Sensual objects are present, but enmeshed within a "mist of accidental features and profiles".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2011|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sensual Object/Real Qualities''': The structure of conscious phenomena are forged from eidetic, or experientially interpretive, qualities intuited intellectually.&lt;ref name="Harman_2011_50"&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2011|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Real Object/Sensual Qualities''': As in the tool-analysis, a withdrawn object is translated into sensual apprehension via a "surface" accessed by thought and/or action.&lt;ref name="Harman_2011_50"/&gt;
* '''Real Object/Real Qualities''': This pairing grounds the capacity of real objects to differ from one another, without collapsing into indefinite substrata.&lt;ref name="Harman_2011_50"/&gt;

To explain how withdrawn objects make contact with and relate to one another, Harman submits the theory of ''vicarious causation'', whereby two hypothetical entities meet in the interior of a third entity, existing side-by-side until something occurs to prompt interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harman compares this idea to the classical notion of formal causation, in which forms do not directly touch, but influence one another in a common space "from which all are partly absent". Causation, says Harman, is always vicarious, asymmetrical, and buffered:

{{quote| 'Vicarious' means that objects confront one another only by proxy, through sensual profiles found only on the interior of some other entity. 'Asymmetrical' means that the initial confrontation always unfolds between a real object and a sensual one. And 'buffered' means that [real objects] do not fuse into [sensual objects], nor [sensual objects] into their sensual neighbors, since all are held at bay through unknown firewalls sustaining the privacy of each. from the asymmetrical and buffered inner life of an object, vicarious connections arise occasionally...giving birth to new objects with their own interior spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2007|pp=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Thus, causation entails the connection between a real object residing within the directionality of consciousness, or a unified "intention," with another real object residing outside of the intention, where the intention itself is also classified as a real object.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2007|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; From here, Harman extrapolates five types of relations between objects. ''Containment'' describes a relation in which the intention "contains" both the real object and sensual object. ''Contiguity'' connotes relations between sensual objects lying side-by-side within an intention, not affecting one another, such that a sensual object's bystanders can be rearranged without disrupting the object's identity. ''Sincerity'' characterizes the absorption of a real object by a sensual object, in a manner that "takes seriously" the sensual object without containing or being contiguous to it. ''Connection'' conveys the vicarious generation of intention by real objects indirectly encountering one another. Finally, ''no relation'' represents the typical condition of reality, since real objects are incapable of direct interaction and are limited in their causal influence upon and relation to other objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harman|2007|pp=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==

Since its inception by Graham Harman in 1999, many authors in a variety of disciplines have adapted and expanded upon Harman's ideas.

===Onticology (Bryant)&lt;!--'Onticology' redirects here--&gt;===

Like Harman, Levi Bryant opposes [[post-Kantian]] [[anthropocentrism]] and philosophies of access.&lt;ref name="bryant1"/&gt; From Bryant's perspective, the Kantian contention that reality is accessible to human knowledge because it is structured by human cognition limits philosophy to a self-reflexive analysis of the mechanisms and institutions through which cognition structures reality. He states:

{{quote| For, in effect, the Copernican Revolution will reduce philosophical investigation to the interrogation of a ''single'' relation: the human-world gap. And indeed, in the reduction of philosophy to the interrogation of this single relation or gap, not only will there be excessive focus on how humans relate to the world to the detriment of anything else, but this interrogation will be profoundly ''asymmetrical''. For the world or the object related to through the agency of the human will becomes a mere prop or vehicle for human cognition, language, and intentions ''without contributing anything of its own''.&lt;ref name="bryant1"/&gt;}}

To counter the form of post-Kantian epistemology, Bryant articulates an object-oriented philosophy called '''onticology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, grounded in three principles. First, the ''Ontic Principle'' states that "there is no difference that does not make a difference".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bryant|Harman|Srnicek|2011|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following from the premises that questions of difference precede epistemological interrogation and that to be is to create differences, this principle posits that knowledge cannot be fixed prior to engagement with difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bryant|Harman|Srnicek|2011|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; And so, for Bryant, the thesis that there is a thing-in-itself which we cannot know is untenable because it presupposes forms of being that make no differences. Similarly, concepts of difference predicated upon negation&amp;mdash;that which objects are not or lack when placed in comparison with one another&amp;mdash;are dismissed as arising only from the perspective of consciousness, rather than an ontological difference that affirms independent being.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bryant|Harman|Srnicek|2011|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the ''Principle of the Inhuman'' asserts that the concept of difference producing difference is not restricted to human, sociocultural, or epistemological domains, thereby marking the being of difference as independent of knowledge and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bryant|Harman|Srnicek|2011|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans exist as difference-making beings among other difference-making beings, therefore, without holding any special position with respect to other differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bryant|Harman|Srnicek|2011|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, the ''Ontological Principle'' maintains that if there is no difference that does not also make a difference, then the making of difference is the minimal condition for the existence of being. In Bryant's words, "if a difference is made, then the being is".&lt;ref name="Bryant_269"&gt;{{harvp|Bryant|Harman|Srnicek|2011|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant further contends that differences produced by an object can be ''inter-ontic'' (made with respect to another object) or ''intra-ontic'' (pertaining the internal constitution of the object).&lt;ref name="Bryant_269"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bryant2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Levi|title=The Mug Blues|url=http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2010/04/30/the-mug-blues/|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Onticology distinguishes between four different types of objects: bright objects, dim objects, dark objects, and rogue objects. ''Bright objects'' are objects that strongly manifest themselves and heavily impact other objects, such as the ubiquity of cell phones in high-tech cultures.&lt;ref name="Coffield"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coffield|first=Kris|title=Interview: Levi Bryant|url=http://fracturedpolitics.com/2011/06/29/interview-levi-bryant.aspx|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dim objects'' lightly manifest themselves in an assemblage of objects; for example, a neutrino passing through solid matter without producing observable effects.&lt;ref name="Coffield"/&gt; ''Dark objects'' are objects that are so completely withdrawn that they produce no local manifestations and do not affect any other objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Levi|title=Dark Objects|url=http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/dark-objects/|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rogue objects'' are not chained to any given assemblage of objects, but instead wander in and out of assemblages, modifying relations within the assemblages into which they enter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Levi|title=Rogue Objects|url=http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/rogue-objects/|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political protestors exemplify rogue objects by breaking with the norms and relations of a dominant political assemblage in order to forge new relations that challenge, change, or cast off the prior assemblage. Additionally, Bryant has proposed the concept of 'wilderness ontology' to explain the philosophical pluralization of agency away from human privilege.

===Hyperobjects (Morton)===

[[Timothy Morton]] became involved with object-oriented ontology after his ecological writings were favorably compared with the movement's ideas. In ''The Ecological Thought'', Morton introduced the concept of ''hyperobjects'' to describe objects that are so massively distributed in time and space as to transcend spatiotemporal specificity, such as global warming, styrofoam, and radioactive plutonium.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2010|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has subsequently enumerated five characteristics of hyperobjects:

# '''Viscous:''' Hyperobjects adhere to any other object they touch, no matter how hard an object tries to resist. In this way, hyperobjects overrule ironic distance, meaning that the more an object tries to resist a hyperobject, the more glued to the hyperobject it becomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morton|first=Timothy|title=Hyperobjects are Viscous|url=http://ecologywithoutnature.blogspot.com/2010/10/hyperobjects-are-viscous.html|work=Ecology Without Nature|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Molten:''' Hyperobjects are so massive that they refute the idea that spacetime is fixed, concrete, and consistent.&lt;ref name="coffield1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coffield|first=Kris|title=Interview: Timothy Morton|url=http://fracturedpolitics.com/2011/07/05/interview-timothy-morton.aspx|work=Fractured Politics|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Nonlocal:''' Hyperobjects are massively distributed in time and space to the extent that their totality cannot be realized in any particular local manifestation. For example, global warming is a hyperobject that impacts meteorological conditions, such as tornado formation. According to Morton, though, objects don't feel global warming, but instead experience tornadoes as they cause damage in specific places. Thus, nonlocality describes the manner in which a hyperobject becomes more substantial than the local manifestations they produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morton|first=Timothy|title=Hyperobjects are Nonlocal|url=http://ecologywithoutnature.blogspot.com/2010/11/hyperobjects-are-nonlocal.html|work=Ecology Without Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Phased:''' Hyperobjects occupy a higher dimensional space than other entities can normally perceive. Thus, hyperobjects appear to come and go in three-dimensional space, but would appear differently to an observer with a higher multidimensional view.&lt;ref name="coffield1"/&gt;
# '''Interobjective:''' Hyperobjects are formed by relations between more than one object. Consequently, objects are only able to perceive to the imprint, or "footprint," of a hyperobject upon other objects, revealed as information. For example, global warming is formed by interactions between the Sun, fossil fuels, and carbon dioxide, among other objects. Yet, global warming is made apparent through emissions levels, temperature changes, and ocean levels, making it seem as if global warming is a product of scientific models, rather than an object that predated its own measurement.&lt;ref name="coffield1"/&gt;

According to Morton, hyperobjects not only become visible during an age of ecological crisis, but alert humans to the ecological dilemmas defining the age in which they live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morton|first=Timothy|title=Sublime Objects|journal=Speculations|year=2011|volume=II|pages=207–227|url=http://www.speculations-journal.org/storage/Morton_Sublime%20Objects_v2.pdf|accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the existential capacity of hyperobjects to outlast a turn toward less materialistic cultural values, coupled with the threat many such objects pose toward organic matter gives them a potential spiritual quality, in which their treatment by future societies may become indistinguishable from reverential care.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Morton|2010|pp=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alien phenomenology (Bogost)===

[[Ian Bogost]], a video game researcher at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] and founding partner of [[Persuasive Games]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Georgia Tech Homepage|title=Faculty Page|url=http://digitallounge.gatech.edu/faculty/index.html?id=14|work=Georgia Tech Digital Lounge|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; has articulated an "applied" object-oriented ontology, concerned more with the being of specific objects than the exploration of foundational principles.&lt;ref name="Coffield_Bogost"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coffield|first=Kris|title=Interview: Ian Bogost|url=http://fracturedpolitics.com/2011/07/09/20110709.aspx|work=Fractured Politics|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bogost calls his approach ''alien phenomenology'', with the term "alien" designating the manner in which withdrawal accounts for the inviolability of objectal experience. From this perspective, an object may not recognize the experience of other objects because objects relate to one another using metaphors of selfhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gratton|first=Peter|title=Ian Bogost: The Interview|url=http://philosophyinatimeoferror.wordpress.com/2010/04/26/ian-bogost-the-interview/|work=Philosophy in a Time of Error|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alien phenomenology is grounded in three "modes" of practice. First, ''ontography'' entails the production of works that reveal the existence and relation of objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bogost|first=Ian|title=Latour Litanizer|url=http://www.bogost.com/blog/latour_litanizer.shtml|work=Ian Bogost Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, ''metaphorism'' denotes the production of works that speculate about the "inner lives" of objects, including how objects translate the experience of other objects into their own terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bogost|first=Ian|title=Alien Phenomenology|url=http://www.bogost.com/blog/alien_phenomenology.shtml|work=Ian Bogost Blog|accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, ''carpentry'' indicates the creation of artifacts that illustrate the perspective of objects, or how objects construct their own worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bogost|2012|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bogost sometimes refers to his version of object-oriented thought as a ''tiny ontology'' to emphasize his rejection of rigid ontological categorization of forms of being, including distinctions between "real" and "fictional" objects.&lt;ref name="Coffield_Bogost"/&gt;

==Criticism==

Some commentators contend that object-oriented ontology degrades meaning by placing humans and objects on equal footing. Matthew David Segall has argued that object-oriented philosophers should explore the theological and anthropological implications of their ideas in order to avoid "slipping into the nihilism of some speculative realists, where human values are a fluke in an uncaring and fundamentally entropic universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Segall|first=Matthew David|title=Cosmos, Anthropos, and Theos in Harman, Teilhard, and Whitehead|url=http://footnotes2plato.com/2011/07/12/cosmos-anthropos-and-theos-in-harman-teilhard-and-whitehead/|work=Footnotes to Plato|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critical commentators such as David Berry and [[Alexander R. Galloway|Alexander Galloway]] have commented on the historical situatedness of an ontology that mirrors computational processes and even the metaphors and language of computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berry|first=David Michael|title=Critical Theory and the Digital|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/critical-theory-and-the-digital-9781441166395/|work= Critical Theory and the Digital|accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Galloway|first=Alexander R|title=A response to Graham Harman’s "Marginalia on Radical Thinking"|url=http://itself.wordpress.com/2012/06/03/a-response-to-graham-harmans-marginalia-on-radical-thinking/|work= An und für sich|accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural critic [[Steven Shaviro]] has criticized object-oriented ontology as too dismissive of [[process philosophy]]. According to Shaviro, the process philosophies of [[Alfred North Whitehead]], [[Gilbert Simondon]], and [[Gilles Deleuze]] account for how objects come into existence and endure over time, in contrast to the view that objects "are already there" taken by object-oriented approaches.&lt;ref name="Shaviro"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shaviro|first=Steven|title=Processes and Powers|url=http://www.shaviro.com/Blog/?p=995|work=The Pinocchio Theory|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaviro also finds fault with Harman's assertion that Whitehead, Simondon, and [[Iain Hamilton Grant]] undermine objects by positing objects as manifestations of a deeper, underlying substance, saying that the antecedence of these thinkers, particularly Grant and Simondon, includes the "plurality of actually existing objects", rather than a single substance of which objects are mere epiphenomena.&lt;ref name="Shaviro"/&gt;

'''Om''' ({{audio|Om pro.ogg|listen}}, [[IAST]]: ''Oṃ'', [[Devanagari]]: {{script|Deva|ॐ}}) is a sacred sound and a spiritual symbol in [[Hinduism]], that signifies the essence of the ultimate reality, consciousness or [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]].&lt;ref name=james482&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Om", ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism'', Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0823931804}}, page 482&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holdrege1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara A.

The syllable ''Om'' is first mentioned in the [[Upanishads]], the mystical texts associated with  the [[Vedanta]] philosophy.
It has variously been associated with concepts of  "cosmic sound" or "mystical syllable" or "affirmation to something divine", or as symbolism for abstract spiritual concepts in the Upanishads.&lt;ref name=annette /&gt;
In the [[Aranyaka]] and the [[Brahmana]] layers of Vedic texts, the syllable is so widespread and linked to knowledge, that it stands for the "whole of Veda".&lt;ref name=annette /&gt;
The etymological foundations of ''Om'' are repeatedly discussed in the oldest layers of the Vedantic texts (the early Upanishads).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, page 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Grimes (1995), Ganapati: The Song of Self, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791424391}}, pages 78-80 and 201 footnote 34&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aitareya Brahmana]] of Rig Veda, in section 5.32, for example suggests that the three phonetic components of ''Om'' (pronounced ''AUM'') correspond to the three stages of cosmic creation, and when it is read or said, it celebrates the creative powers of the universe.&lt;ref name=annette /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/vedas/aitereya/the_aitareya_brahmanam_of_the_rigveda__s.pdf Aitareya Brahmana 5.32], Rig Veda, pages 139-140 (Sanskrit); for English translation: See {{cite book|author=Arthur Berriedale Keith|title=The Aitareya and Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇas of the Rigveda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSgYAAAAYAAJ |year=1920|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brahmana layer of Vedic texts equate ''Om'' with ''Bhur-bhuvah-Svah'', the latter symbolizing "the whole Veda". They offer various shades of meaning to ''Om'', such as it being "the universe beyond the sun", or that which is "mysterious and inexhaustible", or "the infinite language, the infinite knowledge", or "essence of breath, life, everything that exists", or that "with which one is liberated".&lt;ref name=annette /&gt; The [[Samaveda|Sama Veda]], the poetical Veda, orthographically maps ''Om'' to the audible, the musical truths in its numerous variations (''Oum'', ''Aum'', ''Ovā Ovā Ovā Um'', etc.) and then attempts to extract musical meters from it.&lt;ref name=annette /&gt;

The syllable ''Om'' evolves to mean many abstract ideas in the earliest Upanishads. [[Max Müller]] and other scholars state that these philosophical texts recommend ''Om'' as a "tool for meditation", explain various meanings that the syllable may be in the mind of one meditating, ranging from "artificial and senseless" to "highest concepts such as the cause of the Universe, essence of life, Brahman, Atman, and Self-knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/n111/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], Oxford University Press, pages 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deussenmeaningofom&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 67-85, 227, 284, 308, 318, 361-366, 468, 600-601, 667, 772&lt;/ref&gt;

== Written representation ==
[[Phonological]]ly, the syllable ओम्  represents {{IPA|/aum/}}, which is regularly [[monophthong]]ised to {{IPA|[õː]}} in [[Sanskrit phonology]]. When occurring within spoken Sanskrit, the syllable is subject to the normal rules of [[sandhi]] in [[Sanskrit grammar]], however with the additional peculiarity that after preceding ''a'' or ''ā'', the ''au'' of ''aum''  does not form [[vriddhi]] (''au'') but [[guna]] (''o'') per [[Pāṇini]] 6.1.95 (i.e. 'om').
It is sometimes  also written ओ३म् (''ō̄m'' {{IPA-sa|õːːm|}}), notably by [[Arya Samaj]], where ३ (i.e., the digit "3") is ''[[Pluti|pluta]]'' ("three times as long"), [[pluti|indicating a length]] of three [[morae]] (that is, the time it takes to say three syllables) — an [[vowel length|overlong]] [[nasalised]] [[close-mid back rounded vowel]].

The ''Om'' symbol [[File:Aum.svg|20px]]  is a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] in [[Devanagari]], combining ओ (''{{IAST|au}}'') and [[chandrabindu]] ([[ँ]], ''{{IAST|ṃ}}''). In  [[Unicode]], the symbol is encoded at {{unichar|0950|Devanagari OM}} and at {{unichar|1f549|OM Symbol}} ("generic symbol independent of Devanagari font").

The ''Om'' or ''Aum'' symbol is found on ancient coins, in regional scripts. In [[Sri Lanka]], [[Anuradhapura Kingdom|Anuradhapura era]] coins (dated from the 1st to 4th centuries) are embossed with ''Aum'' along with other symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Parker, ''Ancient Ceylon''  (1909), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=Nk8xpkY0bqEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA490 p. 490].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Nagari]] or [[Devanagari]] representations are found epigraphically on medieval sculpture, such as   the [[dancing Shiva]] (ca. 10th to 12th century); [[Joseph Campbell]] (1949) even argued that the dance posture itself can be taken to  represent ''AUM'' as a symbol  of the entirety of "consciousness, universe" and "the message that God is within a person and without".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell (1949), ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', 108f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Om'' symbol, with [[epigraphic]]al variations, is also found in many [[southeast Asia]]n countries. For example, it is called ''Unalom'' or ''Aum'' in [[Thailand]] and has been a part of various flags and official emblems such as in the [[Royal Standard of Thailand#Fourth reign|Thong Chom Klao]] of [[Mongkut|King Rama IV]] (r. 1851–1868).&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Wong (2001), ''Sounding the Center: History and Aesthetics in Thai Buddhist Performance'', [[University of Chicago Press]], {{ISBN|978-0226905853}}, page 292&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Cambodia]]n official seal has similarly incorporated the ''Aum'' symbol.&lt;ref&gt;James Minahan (2009), ''The Complete Guide to National Symbols and Emblems'', {{ISBN|978-0313344961}}, pages 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[traditional Chinese characters]], it is written as [[:wikt:唵|唵]] ([[pinyin]] – ǎn), and as [[:wikt:嗡|嗡]] (pinyin – wēng) in [[simplified Chinese characters]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

There have been proposals that the ''Om'' syllable may already have had written representations in [[Brahmi script]], dating to before the Common Era. A proposal by Deb (1848) held that the ''[[swastika]]'' is "a [[monogram]]matic representation of the syllable Om, wherein two Brahmi /o/ characters ({{unichar|11011|Brahmi letter O}}) were superposed crosswise and the 'm' was represented by dot".&lt;ref&gt;HK Deb, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, Volume XVII, Number 3, page 137&lt;/ref&gt; A commentary in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' considers this theory questionable and unproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|1bMzAQAAMAAJ|The Swastika|page=PA365}}, Nature, Vol. 110, No. 2758, page 365&lt;/ref&gt;
Roy (2011) proposed  that ''Om'' was represented using the Brahmi symbols for "A", "U" and "M" (&amp;#x11005;&amp;thinsp;&amp;#x11009;&amp;thinsp;&amp;#x1102b;), and that this may have influenced the unusual [[epigraphic]]al features of the symbol {{large|ॐ}} for ''Om''.&lt;ref&gt;Ankita Roy (2011), ''[http://www.mrane.com/images/bramhi.pdf Rediscovering the Brahmi Script]''.

[[File:Om Symbol at Kanaka Durga Temple.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Om Symbol at Kanaka Durga Temple, Vijayawada]]
''Om'' came to be used as a standard utterance at the beginning of [[mantra]]s, chants or citations taken from the  [[Veda]]s. For example, the  [[Gayatri mantra]], which consists of a verse from the [[Rigveda]] Samhita ([[Mandala 3|RV 3]].62.10), is prefixed not just by ''Om'' but by ''Om'' followed by the formula '' bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ''.&lt;ref name=mmwpage17&gt;Monier Monier-Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom, Luzac &amp; Co., London, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; Such recitations continue to be in use in Hinduism, with many major incantations and ceremonial functions beginning and ending with ''Om''.&lt;ref name=lipner /&gt;
[[Swami Maheshwarananda|Maheshwarananda]] (2002) suggests that the Om reflects the cosmological beliefs in Hinduism, as the primordial sound associated with the creation of universe from nothing.&lt;ref name=Mahesh&gt;Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda, ''The hidden power in humans'', Ibera Verlag (2002), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Upanishads ===
The syllable "Om" is described with various meanings in  the [[Upanishads]]. Descriptions include "the sacred sound, the Yes!, the Vedas, the ''Udgitha'' (song of the universe), the infinite, the all encompassing, the whole world, the truth, the ultimate reality, the finest essence, the cause of the Universe, the essence of life, the [[Brahman]], the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], the vehicle of deepest knowledge, and Self-knowledge".&lt;ref name=deussenmeaningofom /&gt;

The [[Chandogya Upanishad]] is one of the oldest Upanishads of Hinduism. It opens with the recommendation that "let a man meditate on Om".&lt;ref name=maxmuller11&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/n111/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Upanishads, Part I, Oxford University Press, pages 1-3 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; It calls the syllable Om as ''udgitha'' (उद्गीथ, song, chant), and asserts that the significance of the syllable is thus: the essence of all beings is earth, the essence of earth is water, the essence of water are the plants, the essence of plants is man, the essence of man is speech, the essence of speech is the [[Rig Veda]], the essence of the Rig Veda is the Sama Veda, and the essence of Sama Veda is the ''udgitha'' (song, ''Om'').&lt;ref name=pauldeussen11 /&gt;

''Rik'' (ऋच्, Ṛc) is speech, states the text, and ''Sāman'' (सामन्) is breath; they are pairs, and because they have love for each other, speech and breath find themselves together and mate to produce a song.&lt;ref name=maxmuller11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pauldeussen11 /&gt; The highest song is Om, asserts section 1.1 of Chandogya Upanishad. It is the symbol of awe, of reverence, of threefold knowledge because ''Adhvaryu'' invokes it, the ''Hotr'' recites it, and ''Udgatr'' sings it.&lt;ref name=pauldeussen11&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 68-70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Patrick Olivelle 2014 page 171-185"&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2014), The Early Upanishads, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195124354}}, page 171-185&lt;/ref&gt;

The second volume of the first chapter continues its discussion of syllable ''Om'', explaining its use as a struggle between ''Devas'' (gods) and ''Asuras'' (demons).&lt;ref name=pauldeussen12&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 70-71 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; Max Muller states that this struggle between gods and demons is considered allegorical by ancient [[Indian people|Indian]] scholars, as good and evil inclinations within man, respectively.&lt;ref name=maxmuller12&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/n111/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Upanishads, Part I, Oxford University Press, pages 4-6 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; The legend in section 1.2 of Chandogya Upanishad states that gods took the ''Udgitha'' (song of ''Om'') unto themselves, thinking, "with this ''song'' we shall overcome the demons".&lt;ref name=hume12&gt;Robert Hume, [https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n199/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 178-180&lt;/ref&gt; The syllable ''Om'' is thus implied as that which inspires the good inclinations within each person.&lt;ref name=maxmuller12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=hume12 /&gt;

Chandogya Upanishad's exposition of syllable ''Om'' in its opening chapter combines etymological speculations, symbolism, metric structure and philosophical themes.&lt;ref name="Patrick Olivelle 2014 page 171-185" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/n111/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Upanishads, Part I, Oxford University Press, pages 4-19 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; In the second chapter of the Chandogya Upanishad, the meaning and significance of ''Om'' evolves into a philosophical discourse, such as in section 2.10 where ''Om'' is linked to the Highest Self,&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/n139/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Upanishads, Part I, Oxford University Press, page 28 with footnote 1&lt;/ref&gt; and section 2.23 where the text asserts ''Om'' is the essence of three forms of knowledge, ''Om'' is [[Brahman]] and "Om is all this [observed world]".&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/34/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Upanishads, Part I, Oxford University Press, page 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Katho Upanishad ====
The Katho Upanishad is the legendary story of a little boy, [[Nachiketa]] – the son of sage Vajasravasa – who meets [[Yama]], the Indian deity of death. Their conversation evolves to a discussion of the nature of man, knowledge, [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (Soul, Self) and [[moksha]] (liberation).&lt;ref name=pauldeussenintro&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 269-273&lt;/ref&gt; In section 1.2, Katho Upanishad characterizes Knowledge/Wisdom as the pursuit of good, and Ignorance/Delusion as the pursuit of pleasant,&lt;ref name=maxmuller121&gt;Max Muller (1962), Katha Upanishad, in The Upanishads – Part II, Dover Publications, {{ISBN|978-0486209937}}, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; that the essence of Veda is to make man liberated and free, look past what has happened and what has not happened, free from the past and the future, beyond good and evil, and one word for this essence is the word ''Om''.&lt;ref name=pauldeussen1214&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 284-286&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Maitri Upanishad ====
The [[Maitrayaniya Upanishad]] in sixth ''Prapathakas'' (lesson) discusses the meaning and significance of ''Om''. The text asserts that ''Om'' represents Brahman-Atman.

The world is Om, its light is Sun, and the Sun is also the light of the syllable ''Om'', asserts the Upanishad. Meditating on Om, is acknowledging and meditating on the Brahman-Atman (Soul, Self).&lt;ref name=maxmuller64 /&gt;

The [[Mandukya Upanishad]] opens by declaring, "Om!, this syllable is this whole world".&lt;ref name=pauldeussenfull /&gt; Thereafter it presents various explanations and theories on what it means and signifies.&lt;ref name=humefull /&gt; This discussion is built on a structure of "four fourths" or "fourfold", derived from ''A'' + ''U'' + ''M'' + "silence" (or without an element).&lt;ref name=pauldeussenfull&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814691}}, pages 605-637&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=humefull&gt;{{citation|first=Robert Ernest|last=Hume|url=https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n411/mode/2up|title=The Thirteen Principal Upanishads|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1921|pages=391–393}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Aum as all states of time'''
:In verse 1, the Upanishad states that time is threefold: the past, the present and the future, that these three are "Aum". The four fourth of time is that which transcends time, that too is "Aum" expressed.&lt;ref name=humefull /&gt;
:'''Aum as all states of Atman'''
:In verse 2, states the Upanishad, everything is Brahman, but Brahman is Atman (the Soul, Self), and that the Atman is fourfold.&lt;ref name=pauldeussenfull /&gt; Johnston summarizes these four states of Self, respectively, as seeking the physical, seeking inner thought, seeking the causes and spiritual consciousness, and the fourth state is realizing oneness with the Self, the Eternal.&lt;ref name=johnston&gt;Charles Johnston, [http://www.universaltheosophy.com/pdf-library/Mandukya%20Upanishad_Johnston.pdf The Measures of the Eternal – Mandukya Upanishad] Theosophical Quarterly, October, 1923, pages 158-162&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Aum as all states of consciousness'''
:In verses 3 to 6, the Mandukya Upanishad enumerates four states of consciousness: wakeful, dream, deep sleep and the state of ''ekatma'' (being one with Self, the oneness of Self).&lt;ref name=humefull /&gt; These four are ''A'' + ''U'' + ''M'' + "without an element" respectively.&lt;ref name=humefull /&gt;
:'''Aum as all of knowledge'''
:In verses 9 to 12, the Mandukya Upanishad enumerates fourfold etymological roots of the syllable "Aum". It states that the first element of "Aum" is ''A'', which is from ''Apti'' (obtaining, reaching) or from ''Adimatva'' (being first).&lt;ref name=pauldeussenfull /&gt; The second element is ''U'', which is from ''Utkarsa'' (exaltation) or from ''Ubhayatva'' (intermediateness).&lt;ref name=humefull /&gt; The third element is ''M'', from ''Miti'' (erecting, constructing) or from ''Mi Minati, or apīti'' (annihilation).&lt;ref name=pauldeussenfull /&gt; The fourth is without an element, without development, beyond the expanse of universe. In this way, states the Upanishad, the syllable Om is indeed the Atman (the self).&lt;ref name=pauldeussenfull /&gt;&lt;ref name=humefull /&gt;

==== Shvetashvatara Upanishad ====
The [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]], in verses 1.14 to 1.16, suggests meditating with the help of syllable ''Om'', where one's perishable body is like one fuel-stick and the syllable ''Om'' is the second fuel-stick, which with discipline and diligent rubbing of the sticks unleashes the concealed fire of thought and awareness within. Such knowledge, asserts the Upanishad, is the goal of Upanishads.&lt;ref name=pauldeussen116&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/236/mode/2up Shvetashvatara Upanishad], The Upanishads, Part II, Oxford University Press, page 237&lt;/ref&gt; The text asserts that ''Om'' is a tool of meditation empowering one to know the God within oneself, to realize one's Atman (Soul, Self).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hume (1921), [https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n417/mode/2up Shvetashvatara Upanishad 1.14 – 1.16], The Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 396-397 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aitareya Aranyaka====
&lt;!--AU is part of AA--&gt;
[[Aitareya Aranyaka]] in verse 23.6,{{clarify|date=September 2016}}&lt;!--AA has six books. You need to cite book, chapter and verse--&gt; explains ''Om'' as "an acknowledgment, melodic confirmation, something that gives momentum and energy to a hymn".&lt;ref name=wilke435 /&gt;
{{Quote|
''Om'' (ॐ) is the ''pratigara'' (agreement) with a hymn. Likewise is ''tatha'' (so be it) with a song. But ''Om'' is something divine, and ''tatha'' is something human.

=== Bhagavad Gita ===
The [[Bhagavad Gita]], in the Epic [[Mahabharata]], mentions the meaning and significance of ''Om'' in several verses. For example, Fowler notes that verse 9.17 of the Bhagavad Gita synthesizes the competing dualistic and monist streams of thought in Hinduism, by using "''Om'' which is the symbol for the indescribable, impersonal [[Brahman]]".&lt;ref name=jfowler164 /&gt;
{{Quote|
I am the Father of this world, Mother, Ordainer, Grandfather, the Thing to be known, the Purifier, the syllable '''Om''', Rik, Saman and also Yajus.

The significance of the sacred syllable in the Hindu traditions, is similarly highlighted in various of its verses, such as verse 17.24 where the importance of ''Om'' during prayers, charity and meditative practices is explained as follows,&lt;ref name=jfowler271 /&gt;
{{Quote|
Therefore, uttering '''Om''', the acts of [[yagna]] (fire ritual), [[dāna]] (charity) and [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]] (austerity) as enjoined in the scriptures, are always begun by those who study the [[Brahman]].
|Bhagavad Gita 17.24|&lt;ref name=jfowler271&gt;Jeaneane D. Fowler (2012), The Bhagavad Gita: A Text and Commentary for Students, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1845193461}}, page 271&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Translator: KT Telang, Editor: Max Muller, {{Google books|5cPKAgAAQBAJ|The Bhagavadgita with the Sanatsujatiya and the Anugita}}, Routledge Print, {{ISBN|978-0700715473}}, page 120&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Yoga Sutra ===
The aphoristic verse 1.27 of Pantanjali's [[Yogasutra]] links ''Om'' to [[Yoga]] practice, as follows,&lt;ref name=charlesj&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/yogasutrasofpata00pata#page/n5/mode/2up ''The Yogasutras of Patanjali''] Charles Johnston (Translator), page 15&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|
तस्य वाचकः प्रणवः &lt;nowiki&gt;॥२७॥&lt;/nowiki&gt;

His word is '''Om'''.
|Yogasutra 1.27|&lt;ref name=charlesj /&gt;}}
[[Charles Johnston (Theosophist)|Johnston]] states this verse highlights the importance of ''Om'' in the meditative practice of Yoga, where it symbolizes three worlds in the Soul; the three times – past, present and future eternity, the three divine powers – creation, preservation and transformation in one Being; and three essences in one Spirit – immortality, omniscience and joy. It is, asserts Johnston, a symbol for the perfected Spiritual Man (his emphasis).&lt;ref name=charlesj /&gt;

=== Puranas ===
[[File:Ganesha-aum.jpg|thumb|upright|The Hindu deity [[Ganesha]] is sometimes linked to the symbol ''Om'' and as the symbol for [[Upanishad]]ic concept of Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John A Grimes |title=Ganapati: Song of the Self |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aoqB4n95pSoC |year=1995 |publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-7914-2439-1 |pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Alter (2004), Elephas Maximus, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0143031741}}, page 95&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The medieval era texts of Hinduism, such as the [[Puranas]] adopt and expand the concept of ''Om'' in their own ways, and to their own theistic sects. According to the [[Vayu Purana]], ''Om'' is the representation of the Hindu [[Trimurti]], and represents the union of the three gods, viz. ''A'' for [[Brahma]], ''U'' for [[Vishnu]] and ''M'' for [[Shiva]]. The three sounds also symbolise the three [[Vedas]], namely ([[Rigveda]], [[Samaveda]], [[Yajurveda]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The [[Shiva Purana]] highlights the relation between deity [[Shiva]] and the ''Pranava'' or ''Om''. Shiva is declared to be ''Om'', and that ''Om'' is Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Beck (1995), Sonic Theology: Hinduism and Sacred Sound, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812611}}, page 154&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jainism ==
In [[Jainism]], om is considered a condensed form of reference to the [[Pañca-Parameṣṭhi]], by their initials ''A+A+A+U+M'' (''{{IAST|o[[pluti|3]]}}{{IAST|m}}''). The [[Dravyasamgraha]] quotes a [[Prakrit]] line:{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1999|pp=410-411}}
:{{lang|sa|ओम एकाक्षर पञ्चपरमेष्ठिनामादिपम्  तत्कथमिति चेत  "अरिहंता असरीरा आयरिया तह उवज्झाया मुणियां"}}{{efn|''{{IAST|oma ekākṣara pañca-parameṣṭhi-nāmā-dipam tatkathamiti cheta "arihatā asarīrā āyariyā taha uvajjhāyā muṇiyā"}}''}}
:Translation: Veneration to the Arhats, veneration to the perfect ones, veneration to the masters, veneration to the teachers, veneration to all the monks in the world.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1999|pp=410-411}}
:''AAAUM'' (or just "Om") is one syllable short form of the initials of the five parameshthis: "[[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]], [[Ashiri]], [[Acharya]], [[Upajjhaya]], [[Jain monasticism|Muni]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/om.html Om – significance in Jainism], Languages and Scripts of India, Colorado State University&lt;/ref&gt;
{{lang|sa|ओं नमः}} ''({{IAST|Oṃ namaḥ}}) Siddhanam'' (6 syllables), ''Om Nhi'' (2 syllables) and just ''Om'' (1 syllable) are the short forms of the Paramesthi-Mantra, also called Namokar Mantra or [[Namokar Mantra|Navkar Mantra]] in Jainism.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1999|pp=410-411}}

== Buddhism ==
[[File:Kannonshoji Azuchi Kyoto pref Japan01s3.jpg|thumb|Nio statues in Kyoto prefecture of Japan, believed to be saying the start and the end of syllable "AUM"&lt;ref name=adrian /&gt;&lt;ref name=helenbaroni /&gt;]]''Om'' is often used in some later schools of Buddhism, for example Tibetan Buddhism, which was influenced by Indian Hinduism and Tantra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=XXgy1WvZCI0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=vajrayana+tantra&amp;ots=C1ZvjK_z5A&amp;sig=UU0LHbiCHNqaDBAxuzUUm7egu6k#v=onepage&amp;q=vajrayana%20tantra&amp;f=false|title=Tantric Revisionings: New Understandings of Tibetan Buddhism and Indian Religion|last=Samuel|first=Geoffrey|date=2005|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=9788120827523|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Vajrayana-Buddhism|title=Vajrayana Buddhism Origins, Vajrayana Buddhism History, Vajrayana Buddhism Beliefs|website=www.patheos.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chinese Buddhism]], ''Om'' is often [[Transliteration|transliterated]] as the [[Chinese character]] {{script|Hant|[[:zh:唵|唵]]}} ([[pinyin]] ''{{lang|pny|ǎn}}'') or {{script|Hant|[[:wikt:嗡|嗡]]}} ([[pinyin]] ''{{lang|pny|wēng}}'').

=== Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayana) ===
In Tibetan [[Buddhism]], ''Om'' is often placed at the beginning of [[mantra]]s and [[dharani]]s. Probably the most well known mantra is "[[Om mani padme hum]]", the six syllable mantra of the [[Bodhisattva]] of compassion, [[Avalokiteśvara]]. This mantra is particularly associated with the four-armed Shadakshari form of Avalokiteśvara. Moreover, as a seed syllable (''[[Bīja|bija]] [[mantra]]''), ''Aum'' is considered sacred and holy in [[Esoteric Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiancentury.com/om.htm|title="OM" - THE SYMBOL OF THE ABSOLUTE|accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars interpret the first word of the mantra ''oṃ maṇipadme hūṃ'' to be ''auṃ'', with a meaning similar to Hinduism – the totality of sound, existence and consciousness.&lt;ref name="carlolsenb"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Different Paths of Buddhism: A Narrative-Historical Introduction|last=Olsen|first=Carl|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2014|ISBN=978-0-8135-3778-8|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Gods of Northern Buddhism: Their History and Iconography|last=Getty|first=Alice|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1988|ISBN=978-0-486-25575-0|pages=29, 191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Oṃ'' has been described by the 14th Dalai Lama as "composed of three pure letters, A, U, and M. These symbolize the impure body, speech, and mind of everyday unenlightened life of a practitioner; they also symbolize the pure exalted body, speech and mind of an enlightened Buddha."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/tib/omph.htm|title=Om Mani Padme Hum by The Dalai Lama|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.

Norton|isbn=978-0-393-70565-2|pages=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Simpkins, Om is a part of many mantras in Tibetan Buddhism and is a symbolism for "wholeness, perfection and the infinite".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.

=== Niō guardian kings and Komainu lion-dogs ===
''Aum'' is symbolically represented by [[Niō]] (仁王) statues in Japan, and their equivalent in East Asia. ''Niō'' appear in pairs in front of Buddhist temple gates and stupas, in the form of two fierce looking guardian kings (''Vajra'').&lt;ref name=adrian /&gt; One has an open mouth, regarded by Buddhists as symbolically speaking the "A" syllable; the other has a closed mouth, symbolically speaking the "Um" syllable. The two together are regarded as saying "Aum", the ''vajra-breath'', or the Absolute in Sanskrit.&lt;ref name=adrian&gt;{{cite book|last=Snodgrass|first=Adrian|authorlink=Adrian Snodgrass|year=2007|title=The Symbolism of the Stupa, Motilal Banarsidass|ISBN=978-8120807815|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=helenbaroni&gt;{{cite book|last=Baroni|first=Helen J.|year=2002|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism|publisher=Rosen Publishing|ISBN= 978-0-8239-2240-6|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Komainu]] (狛犬), also called lion-dogs, found in Japan, Korea and China, also occur in pairs before Buddhist temples and public spaces, and again, one has an open mouth (''Agyō''), the other closed (''Ungyō'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dentsdelion.com/NEWSLETTER/03_Komainu.pdf Komainu and Niô] Dentsdelion Antiques Tokyo Newsletter, Volume 11, Part 3 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''Nio'' statues, they are traditionally interpreted to be saying the start and end of "Aun" – a transliteration of the Sanskrit sacred syllable ''Aum'' (or ''Om''), signifying the start and end of everything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Katherine|year=2004 |title=Animal Motifs in Asian Art|publisher=Dover Publishers|ISBN=978-0-486-43338-7|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arthur|first=Chris|year=2009|title=Irish Elegies|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|ISBN=978-0-230-61534-2|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sikhism==
{{Main article|Ik Onkar}}
[[Image:ekonkar.normal.png|thumb|''Ik Onkar'' of Sikhism|link=Sikhism]]
''Ik Oankar'', iconically represented as {{script|Guru|ੴ}} in [[Sikhism]] are the opening words of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the Sikh scripture.&lt;ref name="M-W Ik Onkar"/&gt; It is the statement that 'there is one God',&lt;ref name = Sikhism&gt;{{cite book |author = Singh, Khushwant| authorlink = Khushwant Singh| chapter=The Sikhs| chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=5LSvkQvvmAMC&amp;pg=PA114&amp; |editor=Kitagawa, Joseph Mitsuo |title=The religious traditions of Asia: religion, history, and culture |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |location=London |year=2002 |page=114 |isbn=0-7007-1762-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |editor-link= Joseph Kitagawa|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that there is 'singularity despite seeming plurality'.&lt;ref name=wazirsingh&gt;{{cite book|title=Aspects of Guru Nanak's philosophy | first=Wazir | last=Singh | year=1969 | publisher=Lahore Book Shop | page=20 | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rWM9AAAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=substitute+ekankar | isbn= | accessdate=2015-09-17 | quote="the 'a,' 'u,' and 'm' of aum have also been explained as signifying the three principles of creation, sustenance and annihilation. ... aumkār in relation to existence implies plurality,  ... but its substitute Ik Oankar definitely implies singularity in spite of the seeming multiplicity of existence. ..."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Oankar'' of Sikhism is related to ''Om'' in Hinduism, states the Indologist [[Wendy Doniger]].&lt;ref name="M-W Ik Onkar"/&gt; Some Sikhs disagree that ''Ik Oankar'' is same as ''Om''.&lt;ref name="M-W Ik Onkar"/&gt; The phrase is a compound of the numeral one (''ik'') and ''onkar'', states Doniger, canonically understood in Sikhism to refer to "absolute monotheistic unity of God".&lt;ref name="M-W Ik Onkar"&gt;{{cite book | title=Merriam-Webster's encyclopedia of world religions | last=Doniger | first=Wendy | year=1999 | publisher=Merriam-Webster | page=500 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC&amp;pg=PA500 | accessdate=2015-09-23 | isbn=978-0-87779-044-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Onkar is, states Wazir Singh, a "variation of Om (Aum) of the ancient Indian scriptures (with a slight change in its orthography), implying the seed-force that evolves as the universe".&lt;ref&gt;Wazir Singh (1969), Guru Nanak's philosophy, Journal of Religious Studies, Vol. 1, Issue 1, page 56&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ik Onkar'' is part of the "Mul Mantra" in Sikh teachings and represents "One God", explains Gulati, where "Ik" means One, and Onkar is "equivalent of the Hindu "Om" (Aum)".&lt;ref name=gulati285&gt;Mahinder Gulati (2008), Comparative Religious And Philosophies : Anthropomorphlsm And Divinity, Atlantic, {{ISBN|978-8126909025}}, pages 284-285; Quote: "While Ek literally means One, Onkar is the equivalent of the Hindu "Om" (Aum), the one syllable sound representing the holy trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva - the God in His entirety."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guru Nanak]] wrote a poem entitled Oankar in which, states Doniger, he "attributed the origin and sense of speech to the Divinity, who is thus the Om-maker".&lt;ref name="M-W Ik Onkar"/&gt;
{{Quote|

''Oankar'' ('the Primal Sound') created [[Brahma]], ''Oankar'' fashioned the consciousness,

By the grace of ''Oankar'', they were liberated through the teachings of the Guru.

''Ik Aumkara'' appears at the start of ''Mul Mantra'', states Kohli, and it occurs as "Aum" in the ''Upanishads'' and in ''Gurbani''.&lt;ref name=sskohli39&gt;SS Kohli (1993), The Sikh and Sikhism, Atlantic, {{ISBN|81-71563368}}, page 35, Quote: "Ik Aumkara is a significant name in Guru Granth Sahib and appears in the very beginning of Mul Mantra. It occurs as Aum in the Upanishads and in Gurbani, the Onam Akshara (the letter Aum) has been considered as the abstract of three worlds (p. 930). According to Brihadaranyaka Upanishad "Aum" connotes both the transcendent and immanent Brahman.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the meaning of ''Oankar'' in the Sikh tradition, states Pashaura Singh, is quite different in certain respects than those in other Indian philosophical traditions.&lt;ref name=pashaura227/&gt;

== Modern reception ==
The Brahmic script ''om''-ligature has become widely recognised in Western [[counterculture]] since the 1960s, mostly in its standard [[Devanagari]] form (ॐ), but the [[Tibetan alphabet]] ''om'' (ༀ) has also gained limited currency in popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Messerle|first=Ulrich|title=Graphics of the Sacred Symbol OM|url=http://om.pinkproton.org/pictures/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''professional practice of behavior analysis''' is one domain of behavior analysis: the others being [[radical behaviorism]], [[experimental analysis of behavior]] and [[applied behavior analysis]].&lt;ref name="Cooper et al. 07"&gt;{{cite book |title=Applied Behavior Analysis |last=Cooper |first=John |author2=Timothy Heron |author3=William Heward  |year=2007 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-142113-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The professional practice of behavior analysis is the delivery of interventions to consumers that are guided by the principles of behaviorism and the research of both the experimental analysis of behavior and applied behavior analysis. Professional practice seeks maximum precision to change behavior most effectively in specific instances.&lt;ref name="Cooper et al. 07"/&gt; Behavior analysts are [[mental health professional]]s and, in some states, may hold a license, certificate or registration as a behavior analyst. In other states, there are no laws governing their practice and, as such, the practice may be prohibited as falling under the practice definition of other mental health professionals.   This is rapidly changing as Behavior Analysts are becoming more and more common.

The professional practice of behavior analysis is a hybrid discipline with specific influences coming from counseling, psychology, education, special education, communication disorders, physical therapy and criminal justice.&lt;ref&gt;Cautilli, J.D. &amp; Dziewolska, H. (2008). Licensing behavior analysis. ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy'', 4(1), 1–13. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; As a discipline it has its own conferences, organizations, certification processes and awards.

==Defining the scope of practice==
{{Main|Licensed behavior analysts}}
The Behavior Analysis Certification Board (BACB) defines [[behavior analysis]] as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bacb.com BACB]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The field of behavior analysis grew out of the scientific study of principles of learning and behavior. It has two main branches: experimental and applied behavior analysis. The experimental analysis of behavior (EAB) is the basic science of this field and has over many decades accumulated a substantial and well-respected research literature. This literature provides the scientific foundation for applied behavior analysis (ABA), which is both an applied science that develops methods of changing behavior and a profession that provides services to meet diverse behavioral needs. Briefly, professionals in applied behavior analysis engage in the specific and comprehensive use of principles of learning, including operant and respondent learning, in order to address behavioral needs of widely varying individuals in diverse settings. Examples of these applications include: building the skills and achievements of children in school settings; enhancing the development, abilities, and choices of children and adults with different kinds of disabilities; and augmenting the performance and satisfaction of employees in organizations and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Behavior Analysis Certification Board|url=http://www.bacb.com/index.php?page=2|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

As the above suggests, behavior analysis is based on the principles of [[operant]] and [[respondent conditioning]]. [[Applied behavior analysis]] (ABA) include the use of [[behavior management]], [[behavioral engineering]] and [[behavior therapy]]. Behavior analysis is an active, environmental-based approach.

Currently in the U.S. some behavior analysts at the masters level are licensed; others work with an international certification where licenses are unavailable, although this may not be allowed in some states or jurisdictions. At the doctoral level many are licensed as [[psychologist]]s with Diplomate status in behavioral psychology or licensed as licensed behavior analysts. Diplomate status alone, however, does not allow one to practice in every state and each state's regulatory statute must be reviewed for the appropriateness and legality of practice.

===Certification===
The Behavior Analyst Certification Board (BACB) offers a technical [[Professional certification|certificate]] in behavior analysis. The American Psychological Association offers a diplomate (post PhD and licensed certification) in behavioral psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Dowd, E.T. (2001) Board Certification (Diplomate) in Behavioral Psychology. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 2(1), l5–28 [http://wwwbaojournal.com BAO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706003236/http://wwwbaojournal.com/ |date=2013-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The meaning of certification===
BACB is a private non-profit organization without governmental powers to regulate behavior analytic practice. However it does wield the power to suspend or revoke certification from those certified if they violate the strict ethical guidelines of practice. As many states are without a licensure act, this has been sufficient to deter violators as it removes their ability to vendor with the state, schools, and insurance companies under that certification. While the BACB certification means that candidates have satisfied entry-level requirements in behavior analytic training, certificants are able to practice independently within the scope of their practice and training. Thus, a BCBA (such as those who go into marketing, engineering, or other approved fields in which BCBAs work) who has never trained to work nor worked with children diagnosed with autism should not attempt to do so independently. Most health insurance companies also recognize the BCBA credential as one conferring the capability and the right to practice independently in many states (including California with the recent passage of SB 946 into law). Some states still require certificants to be licensed by their respective jurisdictions for independent practice when treating behavioral health or medical problems, and a number of states including Arizona and Nevada have created a specific BCBA licensing program (for a full list please refer to the BACB website). Licensed certificants must operate within the scope of their license and within their areas of expertise. Where the government regulates behavior analytic services, unlicensed certificants may be supervised by a licensed professional and operate within the scope of their supervisor's license when treating disorders if that jurisdiction allows such supervision. Unlicensed certificants who provide behavior analytic training for educational or optimal performance purposes do not require licensed supervision, unless the law or precedent prohibits such practice. Where the government does not regulate the treatment of medical or psychological disorders certificants should practice in accord with the laws of their state, province, or country. All certificants must practice within their personal areas of expertise.

===Licensure===
The model licensing act for behavior analysts has been revised several times to reflect best practices and policy. Previous versions included provisions that would have made it in practice more difficult then to obtain the necessary experiential hours for license and independent practice as a clinical psychologist.&lt;ref&gt;The most current act can be found here: http://www.apbahome.net/model-licensing-act.pdf as of Jan 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the person is licensed public protection is still monitored by the licensing board as well as the BACB, both of which make sure that the person receives sufficient ongoing education, and the BACB and licensing board investigate ethical complaints. A licensed behavior analyst would have equal training, knowledge, skills and abilities in their discipline as would a [[mental health counselor]] or [[marriage and family therapist]] in their discipline. In February 2008, Indiana, Arizona, Massachusetts, Vermont, Oklahoma and other states now have legislation pending to create licensure for behavior analysts. Pennsylvania was the first state in 2008 to license behavior specialists to cover behavior analysts. Arizona, less than three weeks later, became the first state to license behavior analysts. Other states such as Nevada and Wisconsin have also passed behavior analytic licensure.

In California, after the defeat of a bill to create a license for BCBAs in 2011, the state government instead passed SB 946 which mandates that all non-governmental insurance agencies reimburse for BCBA for behavior therapy in treating autism, starting in 2012. Unlike many weaker bills mandating that autism be covered by insurance, SB 946 does not currently impose an arbitrary cap on services by age or funding amount – in this it is similar to other treatments such as those for heart attacks or other chronic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;The full text of SB 946 can be found here: (http://www.aroundthecapitol.com/billtrack/text.html?bvid=20110SB94693CHP)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service delivery models==

===Definitions===
Behavior analytic services can be and often are delivered through various treatment modalities. These include:
* '''[[wikt:consultation|Consultation]]''' – an indirect model in which the consultant works with the consultee to change the behavior of the client.
* '''[[Therapy]]''' – (individual, group, or family) in which the therapist works directly with a person with some form of pathology to lessen the pathology.
* '''[[Counseling]]''' – where the counselor works directly with a person who has problems but no pathology.
* '''Coaching''' – in which the coach works with a person to achieve a life goal.

===Primary methods===
The two ''primary methods'' for delivering behavior analytic services are consultation and/or direct therapy; the former involves three parties: consultant, consultee and a client whose behavior is changed (who may or may not be present for all meetings).&lt;ref name="Bergan"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kratochwill, Thomas R. |author2=Bergan, John J. |title=Behavioral consultation and therapy |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-306-43345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consultation can involve working with the consultee (i.e., a parent or teacher) to build a plan around the behavior of a client (i.e., a child or student), or training the consultees themselves to modify the behavior of the client. Within the domain of parent–child consultation, standard intervention includes teaching parents skills such as basic [[reinforcement]], [[Child time-out|time-out]] and how to manipulate different factors to modify behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tharp |first=R.J. |author2=Wetzel, R.G.  |title=Behavior Modification in the Natural Environment |publisher=Academic Press |year=1969 |isbn= 978-0-12-686050-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct therapy involves the relationship of behavior analyst and client, usually one-on-one, in which the analyst is responsible for directly modifying the behavior of their client. Direct therapy is also used in schools but can also be found in [[group home]]s, in a [[behavior modification facility]] and in [[behavior therapy]]&lt;ref name="Bergan"/&gt; (where the focus may be on tasks such as quitting [[smoking]], modifying behaviors for [[sex offenders]] or other types of offenders, modifying behaviors related to [[mood disorder]]s) or to encourage job seeking behavior in psychiatric patients.&lt;ref name="Eisenberg86"&gt;Eisenberg, M.G. &amp; Cole, H.W.

Behavioral self control with the mentally retarded. ''Journal of Applied Rehabilitation Counseling'', 6(1), 27–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of behavior models===
Two older and less used models still exist for the delivery of behavior analytic services. These models worked mostly with normal or typically developing populations. These two models are the ''Behavioral Coaching'' and the ''Behavioral Counseling'' model. Both were very popular in the 1960s–1980s but have recently seen a decline in popularity, in spite of their success, as proponents argued the merits of holding strictly to learning theory.&lt;ref&gt;Mischel, W. (1978). Behavior Therapy's Identity Crisis. ''The Counseling Psychologist'' 7: 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thoresen, C.E. &amp; Coates, T.J. (1978). What Does It Mean to Be a Behavior Therapist?

''The Counseling Psychologist'', 7: 37–43.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association for Behavior Analysis]] International still retains a special interest group in behavioral counseling and coaching.

===History of behavioral counseling===
Behavioral counseling was very popular throughout the 1970s and at least into the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Hosford, R. &amp; de Visser, L. (1974) ''Behavioral approaches to counseling: An introduction.'' Washington, DC: American Personnel and Guidance Association Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, S.D. &amp; Hosford, R.E. (1981). The future of behavioral counseling: Recommendations for a continued empiricism. ''Behavioral Counseling Quarterly'', 1, 9–28&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral counseling is an active action–oriented approach that works with the typically developing population but also assists people with specific/discrete problems such as career decision making, drinking, smoking or rehabilitation after injury.&lt;ref&gt;Couch, R.H. &amp; Allen, C.M. (1973). Behavior modification in rehabilitation facilities: A review. ''Journal of Applied Rehabilitation Counseling'', 4(2), 83–95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rice, J.M. (1985). A behavioral perspective. ''Journal of Applied Rehabilitation Counseling'', 16(3), 26–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life coaching===
The behavioral [[coaching]] model is sometimes referred to as [[life coaching]]. However, like counselors and psychologists, life coaches can have varied orientations/change theories (see [[behavioral change theories]]). Behavioral life coaches operate mainly from a behavior analytic orientation. Unlike therapy this model is applied to people who desire to achieve a specific goal&lt;ref&gt;Simek, T.C. &amp; O'Brien, R.M. (1981). Total golf: A behavioral approach to lowering your score and getting more out of your game. New York, NY: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; such as increasing their assertiveness with others.&lt;ref&gt;McFall, R. &amp; Lillesand, D. (1971). Behavior rehearsal with modeling and coaching in assertion training. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'', 77, 313–323&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McFall, R. &amp; Twentyman, C.T. (1973). Four experiments on the relative contributions of rehearsal, modeling and coaching to assertion training. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'', 81, 299–318&lt;/ref&gt; This model is educational and is usually presented as an alternative to therapy. Coaches use behavioral techniques such as objective setting, goal setting, self-control training and behavioral activation to help clients achieve specific life goals. Behavioral coaching was sometimes used to teach job skills to people having mental retardation or head injury. In this area the model made extensive use of task analysis, direct instruction, role play, reinforcement and error correction.&lt;ref name="Eisenberg86"/&gt; Often this approach employs techniques of [[direct instruction]].

===Goal of increasing reinforcement===
Behavioral counseling was largely seen as a growth model that tried to increase the individuals sense of "freedom" by helping the client reduce punishment or coercion in their lives, build skills, and increase access to reinforcement.&lt;ref name="Krumboltz69"&gt;Krumboltz, J.D. &amp; Thoreson, C.E. (Eds.). (1969). ''Behavioral counseling: Cases and techniques''. New York: Holt, Rinehart, &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; B.F. Skinner created a video discussing the processes involved and the importance of reinforcement to increase the sense of "freedom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=B.F. Skinner on counseling |url=http://alc.alc.org/uhtbin/cgisirsi.exe/x/0/0/57/5?user_id=HSUWEB&amp;searchdata1=799277%7BCKEY%7D |publisher=Insight Media |accessdate=7 July 2010 |format=Videorecording}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral counseling attempts to use in-session reinforcement to improve decision-making,&lt;ref name="Krumboltz69"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kravetz, S.P. &amp; Thomas, K.R.

(1983), a social learning approach to counselor supervision. ''The Counseling Psychologist'', 11(1), 51–58.&lt;/ref&gt; but many held a position based on the use of behavioral psychology with a focus on the use of operant, respondent conditioning procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Hosford, R.E. &amp; Brown, S.D. (1975). Innovations in behavioral approaches to counseling. ''Focus on Guidance'', 8(2), 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Some who did adopt a position on modeling held closer to the behavioral view of modeling as generalized imitation developed through learning processes.&lt;ref&gt;Brigham, T.A. &amp; Sherman, J.A. (1968). "An experimental analysis of verbal imitation in preschool children". ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'', 1, 151–158.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weight loss===
The behavioral counseling approach became very popular in weight reduction&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, R.B. (1967). Behavioral Control of overeating. ''Behaviour Research and Therapy'', 5, 357–365. [http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1983/A1983QN93200001.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, R.B. (Ed.). (1977). ''Behavioral self management: Strategies, techniques, and outcomes.''

Behavioral counseling for weight loss by Richard B. Stuart led to the commercial program called ''Weight Watchers''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weightwatchers.com/about/prs/wwi_template.aspx?GCMSID=1002801 WeightWatchers.com: About Us&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, efforts have been made to resurrect interest in behavioral counseling as a method to effectively deliver services to normal problemed populations.&lt;ref&gt;Cautilli, J.D.

==Treatment of autism==

===Therapy qualifications===
These are generally treatments based on [[applied behavior analysis]] (ABA) and involve intensive training of the therapists, extensive time spent in ABA therapy (20–40 hours per week) and weekly supervision by experienced clinical supervisors—known as board certified behavior analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shook, G.L. |author2=Neisworth, J.T. |year=2005 |title=Ensuring appropriate qualifications for applied behavior analyst professionals: the Behavior Analyst Certification Board |journal=Exceptionality |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=3–10 |doi=10.1207/s15327035ex1301_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABA therapy often employs principles of [[overlearning]] to help acquire mastery and fluency of skills.

===Children with autism===
The ABA approach teaches many skills such as appropriate play (a precursor to social interaction and engagement with the world and others),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stahmer, A.C. |year=1995 |title=Teaching symbolic play skills to children with autism using Pivotal Response Training |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=123–41 |doi=10.1007/BF02178500 |pmid=7559281}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stahmer, A.C.; Schreibman, L. &amp; Palardy-Powell, N.

===Imitation===
Imitation can also be directly trained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ingersoll, B. |title=Teaching Imitation to Children with Autism: A focus on Social Reciprocity |journal=Journal of Speech-Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=2 |pages=269–277 |issue=3 |year=2007 |doi=10.1037/h0100224}} [http://www.baojournal.com/ BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; ABA therapies teach these skills through use of behavioral observation and reinforcement or prompting to teach each step of a behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Simpson, R.L. |year=2001 |title=ABA and students with autism spectrum disorders: issues and considerations for effective practice |journal= Focus Autism Other Dev Disabl |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=68–71 |doi=10.1177/108835760101600202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research and treatments===
Extensive research exists to show that behavior analysis is an effective treatment for autism with literally hundreds of studies showing its effectiveness with persons of all ages in enhancing functioning, building skills and independence as well as improving life quality.&lt;ref&gt;Matson, J.L.; Benavidez, D.A.; Compton, L.S.; Paclawskyj, T. &amp; Baglio, C. (1996). Behavioral treatment of autistic persons: A review of research from 1980 to the present. ''Research in Developmental Disabilities'', 17, 433–465.&lt;/ref&gt; What remains controversial are claims of behavior analysis "curing autism". This controversy exists because behavior analysis is used to alter rates of behavior, and not the condition of "autism." Nonetheless, behavior analysis is used to treat the behaviors of many in the autistic population.&lt;ref name="Brandsma01"&gt;Brandsma, L.L. &amp; Herbert, J.D. (2001). Applied Behavior Analysis for Childhood Autism: Does the Emperor Have Clothes? ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3(1), 145–156 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; While several small studies exist showing that behavior analysis holds promise in this area, the number of well-controlled studies do not rise to the level required by the American Psychological Association to hold the treatment as empirically supported in this area.&lt;ref name="Brandsma01"/&gt;

===Misconceptions of treatment===
&lt;!--What does the ABA stand for ?--&gt;
An increasing amount of research in the field of applied behavior analysis is concerned with autism; and it is a common misconception that behavior analysts work almost exclusively with individuals with autism and that ABA is synonymous with discrete trials teaching. ABA principles can also be used with a range of [[neurotypical|typical]] or atypical individuals whose issues vary from developmental delays, significant behavioral problems or undesirable habits.

Curriculum development in behavior analytic programs for children with autism is important.&lt;ref&gt;Lund, S.K. (2001). Content and Contingencies: Considerations Regarding Curriculum Development for Young Children with Autism. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 2(3), 187–191 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Curriculum should carefully task analyze the skill needed to be learned and then ensure that proper tool skills have been taught before the skill itself is attempted to be taught.&lt;ref&gt;Lund, S.K. (2004) Selection-Based Imitation: A Tool Skill in the Development of Receptive Language in Children With Autism. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 5(1), 26–34 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Applied behavior analysis is often confused as a ''table-only'' therapy. Properly performed, applied behavior analysis should be done in both table and [[pivotal response training|natural environments]] depending on the student's progress and needs.&lt;ref name="Ferraioli05"&gt;Ferraioli, S.; Hughes, C.; Smith, T. (2005). "A Model for Problem Solving in Discrete Trial Training for Children With Autism". ''Journal of Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention'' 2(4), 224–240 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Once a student has mastered a skill at the table the team should move the student into a natural environment for further training and generalization of the skill.

Frequently standardized assessments such as the [[Assessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills]] (ABLLS) is used to create a baseline of the learner's functional skill set. The ABLLS breaks down the learner's strengths and weaknesses to best tailor the applied behavior analysis curriculum to them. By focusing on the exact skills that need help the teacher does not teach a skill the student knows. This can also prevent student frustration at attempting a skill for which they are not ready.

Many families have fought school districts for such programs. [[Donald M. Baer|Donald Baer]], a behavior analyst who often testified as an expert witness, provided several letters to lawyers before he died. Ohio State has archived those letters.&lt;ref name="OS1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Baer |title=Letters |url=http://streaming1.osu.edu:7070/ramgen/media/behavioranal02/baer.rm |publisher=Ohio State |accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discrete trials===
Discrete trials were originally used by people studying [[classical conditioning]] to demonstrate stimulus–stimulus pairing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Discrete trials are often contrasted with free operant procedures, like ones used by [[B.F. Skinner]] in learning experiments with rats and pigeons, to show how learning was influenced by rates of [[reinforcement]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The discrete trials method was adapted as a therapy for [[developmental disability|developmentally delayed]] children and individuals with autism. For example, [[Ole Ivar Lovaas]] used discrete trials to teach autistic children skills including making eye contact, following simple instructions, advanced language and social skills. These discrete trials involved breaking a behavior into its most basic functional unit and presenting the units in a series.

A discrete trial usually consists of the following: the antecedent, the behavior of the student and a consequence. If the student's behavior matches what is desired the consequence is something positive: food, candy, a game, praise, etc. If the behavior was not correct the teacher offers the correct answer then repeats the trial possibly with more prompting, if needed.

There is usually an inter-trial interval that allows for a few seconds to separate each trial to allow the student to process the information, teach the student to wait and make the onset of the next trial more discrete. Discrete trials can be used to develop most skills which includes cognitive, verbal communication, play, social and self-help skills. There is a carefully laid out procedure for error correction and a problem solving model to use if the program gets stuck.&lt;ref name="Ferraioli05"/&gt; Discrete trial is sometimes referred to as the [[Lovaas technique]].

Discrete trials have been helpful in the treatment of pediatric feeding problems&lt;ref&gt;Kerwin, M.L. (2003). Pediatric Feeding Problems. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 4(2), 162–175 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the prevention of feeding problems.&lt;ref name= "Pediatric Feeding Tube"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pediatric Feeding Disorders |url=https://pediatricfeeding.com/pediatric-feeding-problems/|publisher=Feeding Clinic of Santa Monica|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free operant procedures===
{{Main|Natural language procedures}}
In language training, many free operant procedures emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, B.M. &amp; Risley, T.R. (1968). Establishing the use of descriptive adjectives in the spontaneous speech of disdvantaged children. ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'', 1, 109–120&lt;/ref&gt; These procedures did not try to train discrimination first, and then passively wait for generalization, but instead worked from the start on actively promoting generalization.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, T.F. &amp; Baer, D.M. (1977). An implicit technology of generalization. ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'', 10, 349–367.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the model was referred to as ''incidental teaching'' but later was called ''milieu language teaching'' and finally ''natural language teaching''. Peterson (2007) completed a comprehensive review of 57 studies on these training procedures. This review found that 84% of the studies of the natural language procedures looked at maintenance and 94% looked at generalization and were able to provide direct support of its occurrence as part of the training.

==Other applications of applied behavior analysis==

===Clinical behavior analysis===
{{Main|Clinical behavior analysis|Behavioral psychotherapy}}
Dougher's edited volume titled ''Clinical Behavior Analysis'' on Context Press highlights the application of behavior analysis to adult outpatients. He identifies four comprehensive behavior analytic programs: Stephen Hayes ''et al.''{{'s}} [[acceptance and commitment therapy]] (ACT), Jacobson et al.  [[behavioral activation]] (BA), Kohlenberg &amp; Tsai's [[functional analytic psychotherapy]], Linehan Dialectical Behavior Therapy, and the [[Community Reinforcement Approach|community reinforcement approach]] for treating addictions. In addition, the book highlights several recent areas of functional analysis research for common clinical problems. Many of these areas are specified in the section on [[behavior therapy]].

===Community reinforcement approach and family training===
{{Main|Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training}}
The study of behavioral factors related to addicitions has a long history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Wikler|Wikler, A.]] (1984). Conditioning factors in opiate addiction and relapse. ''Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment'', 1(4), 279–285. Originally published in 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is no surprise many behavioral treatments would be found to be efficacious.&lt;ref&gt;Chambless, D. &amp; Hollon, S. (1998). Defining empirically supportable therapies. ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology'', 66, 7–18.&lt;/ref&gt; One efficacious approach is the community reinforcement approach. The community reinforcement approach has considerable research supporting it as efficacious.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"&gt;Smith, J.E.; Milford, J.L. &amp; Meyers, R.J. (2004) CRA and CRAFT: Behavioral Approaches to Treating Substance-Abusing Individuals. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 5(4), pp. 391–403 [http://www.baojournal.com/ BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Started in the 1970s by [[Nathan H. Azrin]] and his graduate student Hunt, the community reinforcement approach is a comprehensive operant program built on a functional assessment of a client's drinking behavior and the use of positive reinforcement and [[contingency management]] for nondrinking.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, G.M. &amp; Azrin, N.H. (1973). A community-reinforcement approach to alcoholism. ''Behaviour Research and Therapy'', 11, 91–104.&lt;/ref&gt; When combined with disulfiram ([[Aversion therapy|an aversive procedure]]) community reinforcement showed remarkable effects.&lt;ref&gt;Azrin, N.H.; Sisson, R.W.; Meyers, R.J. &amp; Godley, M.D. (1982). Alcoholism treatment by disulfiram and community reinforcement therapy. ''Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry'', 3, 105–112.&lt;/ref&gt; One component of the program that appears to be particularly strong is the non-drinking club.&lt;ref&gt;Mallams, J.H.; Godley, M.D.; Hall, G.M. &amp; Meyers, R.J. (1982). A social-systems approach to resocializing alcoholics in the community. ''Journal of Studies on Alcohol'', 43, 1115–1123.&lt;/ref&gt; Applications of community reinforcement to public policy has become the recent focus of this approach.&lt;ref&gt;Jaime L.

''International Journal of Behavioral Cconsultation and Therapy'', 3(1), 77–87 [http://www.baojournal.com/ BAO].&lt;/ref&gt;

An offshoot of the community reinforcement approach is the [[Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training|community reinforcement approach and family training]].&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"/&gt; This program is designed to help family members of substance abusers feel empowered to engage in treatment. The rates of success have varied somewhat by study but seem to cluster around 70%.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, K.C.; Marlowe, D.B.; Festinger, D.S.; Garvey, K.A. &amp; LaMonaca, V. (1999).

===Recidivism===
{{Main|Teaching-Family Model|Radical_behaviorism}}
Recent studies showing that behavior analysis can reduce recidivism have led to a resurgence in behavior therapy facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Illescas, S.R.; Sánchez-Meca, J. &amp; Genovés, V.G. (2001). TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS AND RECIDIVISM: ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROGRAMMES APPLIED IN EUROPE ''Psychology in Spain'', 5, 47–62&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular interest has been the growing research on the [[Teaching-Family Model]] which was developed by [[Montrose Wolf]] and clearly reduces recidivism rates. In addition, behaviorally-based early intervention programs have shown effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Strain, S.P.

===Exposure therapy===
{{Main|Exposure therapy}}
Methods of counter-conditioning and respondent extinction, called exposure therapy, are often employed by many behavior therapists in the treatment of phobias, anxiety disorders such as [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), and addictions (cue exposure). [[Prolonged exposure therapy]] has been particularly helpful with PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;Eftekhari, A.; Stines, L.R. &amp; Zoellner, L.A. (2005). Do You Need To Talk About It? Prolonged Exposure for the Treatment of Chronic PTSD. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 7(1), 70–83 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Several procedures to block respondent conditioning such as blocking and overshadowing are sometimes used in behavioral medicine to prevent conditioned taste aversion for patients with chemotherapy treatments. [[Exposure and response|Exposure with Response Prevention]] (ERP) is a respondent extinction procedure often used to treat obsessive–compulsive behavior. [[Escape response]] blocking is critical for this procedure. For PTSDs exposure therapy is one of the few evidence-based techniques.&lt;ref name="Hassija07"&gt;Hassija, C.M. &amp; Gray, M.J. (2007). Behavioral Interventions for Trauma and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy'', 3(2), 166–175 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research suggests exposure therapy is an excellent means of alleviating both the anxiety and cognitive symptoms specific to PTSD with no additive effect for additional cognitive components.&lt;ref name="Hassija07"/&gt; Several authors have argued that exposure by itself is necessary and sufficient to produce behavior change in reducing fear in social phobics and helping them engage more effectively with others.&lt;ref&gt;Moreno Gil, P.J.; Méndez Carrillo, F.X., Sánchez Meca, J. [http://www.psychologyinspain.com/content/full/2001/3frame.htm "Effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural treatment in social phobia: a meta-analytic review."] ''Psychology in Spain'', 2001, Vol. 5 17–25.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Washington Post'' ran a story that only exposure therapy is proven for PTSD and that cognitive therapy or even drug therapy are not shown at this time to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/18/AR2007101802186_pf.html |title=Most PTSD Treatments Not Proven Effective |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=7 July 2010 |first=Shankar |last=Vedantam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operant-based EEG biofeedback===
{{Main|Biofeedback}}
Kamiya (1968) demonstrated that the alpha rhythm in humans could be [[operant]]ly conditioned.&lt;ref&gt;Kamiya, J. (1968) Conscious control of brain waves. ''Psychology Today'', 1, 57–60.&lt;/ref&gt; He published an influential article in ''Psychology Today'' that summarized research showing subjects learn to discriminate when alpha was present or absent, and that they could use feedback to shift the dominant alpha frequency about 1&amp;nbsp;Hz. Almost half of his subjects reported experiencing a pleasant "alpha state" characterized as an "alert calmness". These reports may have contributed to the perception of alpha biofeedback as a shortcut to a meditative state. He also studied the [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) correlates of meditative states.&lt;ref&gt;Kamiya, J. (1969). [[Operant]] control of the EEG alpha rhythm. In C. Tart (Ed.), ''Altered states of consciousness''. NY: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Operant conditioning]] of EEG has had considerable support in many areas including [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD)&lt;ref&gt;Alhambra, M.A.; Fowler, T.P. &amp; Alhambra, A.A., (1995). EEG biofeedback: A new treatment option for ADD/ADHD. ''[[Journal of Neurotherapy]]'', 1(2), 39–43.&lt;/ref&gt; and even [[seizure disorders]]. Early studies of the procedure included the treatment of seizure disorders. Luber and colleagues (1981) conducted a double blind crossover study showing that seizure activity decreased by 50% in the contingent conditioning of inhibiting brain waves as opposed to the non-contingent use.&lt;ref&gt;Lubar, J.F.; Shabsin, H.S.; Natelson, S.E.; Holder, G.S.; Whitsett, S.F.; Pamplin, W.E. &amp; Krulikowski, D.I. (1981). EEG operant conditioning in intractable epileptics. ''Archives of Neurology'', 38(11), 700–704.&lt;/ref&gt; Sterman (2000) reviewed 18 studies of a total of 174 clients and found 82% of the participants had significant seizure reduction (30% less weekly seizures).&lt;ref&gt;Sterman, M.B. (2000). Basic concepts and clinical findings in the treatment of seizure disorders with EEG operant conditioning. ''Clinical Electroencephalography'', 31(1), 45–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizational===
{{Main|Organizational behavior management|Behavioral engineering|Behavior-based safety}}
Behavior analysis with organizations is sometimes combined with systems theory in an approach called organizational behavior management. This approach has shown success particularly in the area of [[behavior-based safety]]. Behavior safety research has lately become focused on factors that lead programs to being retained in institutions long after the designer leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Roman, H.R. &amp; Boyce, T.E. (2001). Institutionalizing Behavior-Based Safety: Theories, Concepts, And Practical Suggestions. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3(1), 76–82 [http://www.baojournal.com/ BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational===
{{Main|Direct instruction|Positive behavior support|Curriculum-based measurement|Functional analysis (psychology)}}
[[Direct instruction]] and [[Direct Instruction]]: the former representing the process and the latter a specific curriculum that highlights that process remain both current and controversial in behavior analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, T. &amp; Axelrod, S. (2005). Direct Instruction: An Educators' Guide and a Plea for Action. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 6(2), Page 111 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; The essential features are a carefully structured fast paced program based on teacher-directed small group instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, W.C. (1977). Teaching reading and language to the disadvantaged: What we have learned from field research? ''Harvard Educational Review'', 47, 518–543&lt;/ref&gt; One controversy that remains is that teacher creativity is admonished in the program.&lt;ref&gt;Aukerman, R.C. (1984). ''Approaches to reading.'' New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Even with such issues to be worked out positive gains in reading for the approach have been reported in the literature since 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Biloine, Y.W. (1968).

''Elementary School Journal'', 84, 241–252&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the positive gains reported by Meyer (1984) found that 34% of children in the DISTAR group were accepted to college as compared to only 17% of the control school.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, L.A. (1984). Long term academic effects on the direct instruction project follow through. ''Elementary School Journal'', 84, 380–394&lt;/ref&gt; Current research is focused on peer delivery of the program.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand–Martella, &amp; Martella (2002) An Overview and Research Summary of Peer-Delivered Corrective Reading. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3(2), 214–221. [http://www.baojournal.com/ BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

School-wide [[positive behavior support]]&lt;ref name="Tobin01"/&gt; is based on the use of behavior analytic procedures delivered in an organizational behavior management approach. School-wide behavioral support has been increasingly accepted by administrators, law–makers and teachers as a way to improve safety in classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Sugai, G. &amp; Horner, R.H.

[http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Curriculum-based measurement]] and curriculum matching is another active area of application.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, A.D.; Skinner, C.H.; Williams, J.; Hawkins, R.; Neddenriep, C.E. &amp; Dizer, J. (2007). Comparing Comprehension Following Silent and Aloud Reading across Elementary and Secondary Students: Implication for Curriculum-Based Measurement. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 8(1), 9–23&lt;/ref&gt; Curriculum-based measurement uses rate and reading performance as the primary variable in determining reading levels. The goal is to better match children to the appropriate curriculum level to remove frustration as well as to track reading performance over time to see if it is improving with intervention. This model also serves as the basis for [[response to intervention]] models.

===Hospital settings===
One area of interest in hospitals is the [[blocking effect]]—especially for conditioned [[taste aversion]]. This area of interest is considered important in the prevention of weigh loss during chemotherapy for cancer patients. Another area of growing interest in the hospital setting is the use of operant-based biofeedback with those suffering from cerebral palsy&lt;ref&gt;Colborne, G.R.; Wright, F.V. &amp; Naumann, S.

===Residential treatment===
{{Main|Residential treatment center}}
Behavioral interventions have been very helpful in reducing problem behaviors in residential treatment centers.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Bodfish &amp; Edward A. Konarski (1992). Reducing problem behaviors in a residential unit using structural analysis and staff management procedures: A preliminary study. ''Behavioral Intervention'', 7(3), 225–234&lt;/ref&gt; The type of residential versus mental retardation does not appear to be a factor.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick J. Fuoco, P. Scott Lawrence, Janice B.

(1987). Assessing pharmacological and contingency management interventions with mentally retarded adolescents in a residential treatment program. ''Behavioral Intervention'', 2(3), 139–152&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space program===
Probably one of the most interesting applications of [[behavior analysis]] in the 1960s was its contribution to the space program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brady, J.V. |year=2007 |title=Behavior analysis in the space age |journal=Behav Analyst Today |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=398–412 |url=http://baojournal.com |format=PDF |doi=10.1037/h0100640}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this area is used to train astronauts including the chimpanzees sent into space. Continued work in this area focuses on ensuring that astronauts who live in confined areas and space do not develop behavioral health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Emurian, H.H. |author2=Brady, J.V. |year=2007 |title=Behavioral health management of space dwelling groups: safe passage beyond earth orbit |journal=Behav Analyst Today |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=113–35 |url=http://www.ibrinc.org/publications/Emurian_Brady_2007.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1037/h0100607|citeseerx=10.1.1.599.8012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of this work was led by pioneer behaviorist [[Joseph V. Brady]].

==Consumer and professional relationships==
Open communication and a supportive relationship between educational systems and families allow the student to receive a beneficial education. This pertains to typical learners as well as to individuals who need additional services. It was not until the 1960s that researchers began exploring behavior analysis as a method to educate those children who fall somewhere along the autism spectrum. Behavior analysts agree that consistency in and out of the school classroom is key in order for children with autism to maintain proper standing in school and continue to develop to their greatest potential.

Applied behavior analysts sometimes work with a team to address a person's educational or behavioral needs. Other professionals such as speech therapists, physicians and the primary caregivers are treated as key to the implementation of successful therapy in the applied behavior analysis (ABA) model. The ABA method relies on behavior principles to develop treatments appropriate for the individual. Regular meetings with professionals to discuss programming are one way to establish a successful working relationship between a family and their school. It is beneficial when a caregiver can conduct generalization procedures outside of school. In the ABA framework, developing and maintaining a structured working relationship between parents or guardians and professionals is essential to ensure consistent treatment.

==Intervention goals==
When working directly with clients, behavior analysts engage in a process of collaborative [[goal setting]].&lt;ref&gt;Locke, E.A. &amp; Latham, G.P. (1985). The application of goal setting to sports. ''Journal of Sports Psychology'', 7, 205–222.&lt;/ref&gt; Goal setting ensures that the client is already under [[stimulus control]] of the goal and is thus more likely to engage in behavior to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, G. &amp; Paer, J. (2007). ''Behavior Modification: What it is and how to do it.'' 7th Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior analytic programs are ultimately skill building,&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, M.D. &amp; Bailey, J.S. (1985). Behavioral physical therapy and spina bifida: A case study.

==History==
Applied behavior analysis is the applied side of the [[experimental analysis of behavior]]. It is based on the principles of [[operant conditioning|operant]] and [[respondent conditioning]] and represents a major approach to behavior therapies. Its origin can be traced back to Teodoro Ayllon and [[Jack Michael]]'s 1959 article "The psychiatric nurse as a behavioral engineer"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ayllon, T. |author2=Michael, J. |title=The psychiatric nurse as a behavioral engineer |journal=J Exp Anal Behav |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=323–34 |year=1959 |pmid=13795356 |doi= 10.1901/jeab.1959.2-323 |pmc=1403907}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to initial efforts to implement teaching machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |year=1965 |volume=162 |issue=989 |pages=427–43 |title=The technology of teaching |author=Skinner, B.F. |doi=10.1098/rspb.1965.0048 |pmid=4378497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research basis of ABA can be found in the theoretical work of [[behaviorism]] and [[radical behaviorism]] originating with the work of [[B.F. Skinner]]. In 1968 Baer, Wolf and Risley wrote an article&lt;ref&gt;Baer, D.M.; Wolf, M.M.; Risley, T.R. (1968). "Some current dimensions of applied behavior analysis". J Appl Behav Anal 1 (1): 91–7.&lt;/ref&gt; that was the source of contemporary [[applied behavior analysis]] providing the criteria to judge the adequacy of research and practice in applied behavior analysis. It became the core and centerpiece [[behavioral engineering]].

Work in respondent conditioning (what some would term [[classical conditioning]]) began with the work of [[Joseph Wolpe]] in the 1960s. It was improved by the work of [[Edna B Foa]] who did extensive research on [[exposure and response prevention]] for [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD). In addition, she worked on [[exposure therapy]] for [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].

Over the years most behavior analysts have existed and conducted research in many areas and University departments: behavior analysis, psychology, special education, regular education, speech–language pathology, communication disorders, school psychology, criminal justice and family life. They have belonged to many organizations including the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) and have most often found a core intellectual home in the [[Association for Behavior Analysis]] International.&lt;ref name="Twyman07"&gt;Twyman, J.S. (2007). A new era of science and practice inbehavior analysis. ''Association for Behavior Analysis International: Newsletter'', 30(3), 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hassert08"&gt;Hassert, D.L.; Kelly, A.N.; Pritchard, J.K. &amp; Cautilli, J.D. (2008). The Licensing of Behavior Analysts: Protecting the profession and the public. ''Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention'', 5(2),'' 8–19 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Core focus===
With a core focus on enhanced functioning and skill development behavior analytic interventions under the heading [[behavior therapy]] have come to form the core of evidence-based practices in speech–language pathology, [[organizational behavior management]], [[education]], [[mental health]] and [[addiction]] treatments. In the area of mental health and addictions a recent article looked at APA's list for well-established and promising practices and found a considerable number of them based on the principles of [[operant conditioning]] and [[respondent conditioning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Donohue, W. |author2=Ferguson, K.E. |year=2006 |title=Evidence-based practice in psychology and behavior analysis |journal=Behav Analyst Today |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=335–50 |url=http://baojournal.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1985 meta-analysis of [[social skills]] training methods found operant conditioning procedures had the largest effect size, the greatest generalization and the shortest training time; [[observational learning|modeling]], [[coaching]], and social cognitive techniques, respectively, had smaller and smaller effect sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Schneider, B.H. |author2=Bryne, B.M. |year=1985 |chapter=Children's social skills training: a meta-analysis. |editor1=Schneider, B.H. |editor2=Rubin, K.H. |editor3=Ledingham, J.E. |title=Children's Peer Relations: Issues in Assessment and Intervention |pages=175–90 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=978-0-387-96163-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current research===
Behavior analysis remains one of the most active research areas in all of [[psychology]], [[counseling]], [[special education]], [[developmental disability]], [[mental health]] and other studies of [[human behavior]]. Current research in behavior analysis focuses on expanding the tradition by looking at setting events, [[behavioral activation]], the [[Matching law]], [[relational frame theory]], stimulus equivalences and [[covert conditioning]] as exemplified in Skinner's model of rule-governed behavior ''[[Verbal Behavior]]''.&lt;ref name="Barry06"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Snyder, J. |author2=McEachern, A. |author3=Schrepferman, L. |year=2006 |title=Rule-governance, correspondence training, and discrimination learning: a developmental analysis of covert conduct problems |journal=J Speech Lang Pathol Appl Behav Anal |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43–55 |url=http://baojournal.com/SLP-ABA-VOL-1/SLP-ABA-1-1.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1037/h0100187|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior analysis has moved past being just basic interventions for problems and into more comprehensive analyses of [[behavior analysis of child development|child development behavior]].

===Experimental psychopathology===
Experimental psychopathology is a behavior therapy area in which animal models are developed to simulate human pathology. For example, Wolpe studied cats to build his theory of human [[anxiety]]. This work continues today in the study of both pathology and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Borrero, Timothy R. Vollmer, Andrew L. Samaha, Kimberly N. Sloman &amp; Monica T. Francisco (2007). Evaluating Features of Behavioral Treatments in the Nonhuman Animal Laboratory. ''Behavior Analyst Today'', 8(2), 136–144. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical controversies==
Initially, applied behavior analysis used punishment such as shouting and slaps to reduce unwanted behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Moser, D. |author2=Grant, A. |title=Screams, slaps and love |date=1965-05-07 |work=Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethical opposition to such aversive practices caused them to fall out of favor and has stimulated development of less aversive methods. In general, aversion therapy and [[punishment]] are now less frequently used as ABA treatments due to legal restrictions.&lt;ref name="Mayer95"&gt;Mayer, G.R. &amp; Mayer, J.F. (1995). Legislation in California mandates behavior analysis services and minimizes use of aversives. ''The ABA Newsletter International'', 18, 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, procedures such as odor aversion, [[covert sensitization]] and other [[covert conditioning]] procedures, based on punishment or aversion strategies, are still used effectively in the treatment of [[pedophiles]].&lt;ref name="Marshall91"&gt;Marshall, W.L.; Jones, R.; Ward, T.; Johnston, P. &amp; Bambaree, H.E. (1991). Treatment of sex offenders. ''Clinical Psychology Review'', 11, 465–485&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, with some populations such as conduct disorder in children there is considerable evidence that has developed to show that all positive programs can produce change but that children will not enter into the normal range without [[punishment]] procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, G.R.; Reid, J. &amp; Eddy, J.M. (2002). A brief history of the Oregon Model. In J.B. Reid, G.R. Patterson &amp; J. Snyder. ''Antisocial behavior in children and adolescents: A developmental analysis and model for intervention''. (page 6) APA Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, H.M.; Colvin, G. &amp; Ramsey, E. (1995). ''Antisocial behavior in schools: Strategies and best practices''. Brookes&lt;/ref&gt; These programs have shifted to using [[child time-out]] and response–cost procedures to ensure that clients rights to effective interventions are met.

===Homosexuality===
In 1973 the APA [[Homosexuality and psychology#Declassification|removed]] homosexuality from its [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] yet it kept "ego dystonic" homosexuality as a condition until the DSM III-R (1987).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In 1974 [[Ole Ivar Lovaas]], pioneer of the use of discrete trial teaching (DTT) to treat autism, was the second author on a [[scientific journal|journal article]] describing the use of ABA{{Clarify|What do these initials mean|date=July 2010}} to reduce "feminine" behaviors and increase "masculine" behaviors of a male child in an effort to prevent adult [[transsexualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rekers, G.A. |author2=Lovaas, O.I. |title=Behavioral treatment of deviant sex-role behaviors in a male child |journal=J Appl Behav Anal |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=173–90 |year=1974 |pmid=4436165 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1974.7-173 |pmc=1311956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatments designed to uphold traditional sex-role behaviors were opposed by some behavior analysts who argued that the intervention was not justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nordyke, N.S. |author2=Baer, D.M. |author3=Etzel, B.C. |author4=LeBlanc, J.M. |title=Implications of the stereotyping and modification of sex role |journal=J Appl Behav Anal |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=553–7 |year=1977 |pmid=924924 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1977.10-553 |pmc=1311225}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s Wolpe refused to treat homosexual behavior arguing that it was easier and more productive to treat the religious guilt than the homosexuality. He instead provided assertiveness training to a homosexual client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wolpe, J. |year=1969 |title=The Practice of Behavior Therapy |publisher=Pergamon |isbn=978-0-08-021148-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most behavior analysts and behavior therapists have not worked in sexual re–orientation therapy since [[Gerald Davison]] argued that the issue was not one of effectiveness but of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |year=1978 |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=170–2 |title=Not can but ought: the treatment of homosexuality |author=Davison, G.C. |pmid=627651 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.46.1.170}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he wrote the paper presenting this position, Davison was president of the Association for the Advancement of Behavior Therapy, now the [[Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies]], and thus his views carried much weight. Davison argued that homosexuality is not pathological and is only a problem if it is regarded as one by society and the therapist.

==Ethical practice==

===Punishment and aversion therapies===
The use of [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]] and aversion therapy procedures are a constant ethical challenge for behavior analysts. One of the original reasons for the development of the Behavior Analyst Certification Board were cases of abuse from behaviorists.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, J.S. &amp; Burch, M.R. (2005). ''Ethics for behavior analysts''. LEA&lt;/ref&gt; Both continue to draw proponents and opposition, however, in some of the more controversial cases some middle ground has been found through legislation (see [[Judge Rotenberg Educational Center]]).&lt;ref name="Mayer95"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bill would limit, not ban, shock therapy |work=The Boston Globe |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/01/17/showdown_over_shock_therapy/ |accessdate=2008-02-20 |author=Wen, Patricia |date=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex offenders and recidivism===
A study in 1991 showed that [[behavior modification]] was effective in [[sex offender]] treatment and [[covert sensitization]], and it has been shown to have some effects on reducing recidivism.&lt;ref name="Marshall91"/&gt; However Gene Able, who has done extensive research in this area, suggests that it is not as effective outside of the package which contains odor [[Aversion therapy|aversion]], satiation therapy (mastubatory reconditioning),&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, W.L. (1979). Satiation therapy: A procedure for reducing deviant sexual arousal. ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis'', 12, 377–389.&lt;/ref&gt; and various social skills training programs including empathy training. Current behavior analysis programs offer this type of comprehensive treatment approach.&lt;ref&gt;Plaud, J.J.; Muench-Plaud, D.; Kolstoe, P.D. &amp; Orveldal, L.(2000). Behavioral treatment of sexual offending behavior. ''Mental Health Aspects of Developmental Disabilities'', 3, 54–61.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition they use a combination of functional assessment, behavior chain analysis and risk assessment to create relapse prevention strategies and to help the offender to develop better self-control.&lt;ref&gt;Vess, J. (2008). Risk formulation with sex offenders: Integrating functional analysis and actuarial measures. ''Journal of Behavior Analysis of Offender and Victim: Treatment and Prevention'', 1(4), 28–41 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

With sex offenders who have retardation, comprehensive behavioral programming has been effective at least in the short run.&lt;ref&gt;Gloria Losada-Paisey &amp; Timothy J.H. Paisey (1987). Program evaluation of a comprehensive treatment package for mentally retarded offenders. ''Behavioral Intervention'', 3(4), 247–265&lt;/ref&gt; This treatment included formal academic and vocational training, sex education, a unit [[token economy]], and individual behavior therapy including sexual reconditioning. In addition it included supported competitive employment, fading of program structure, and increased community participation.

==Journals==
There are multiple journals which produce articles on the clinical applications of [[applied behavior analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cooper, J.O.|author2=Heron, T.E.|author3=Heward, W.L.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2007|title=Applied behavior analysis|publisher=Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular, and widely used, of these journals is the ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|journal = Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|doi= 10.1002/(ISSN)1938-3703}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many other journals dedicated to this field.  Some of these include ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', the ''International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy'' and three new journals scheduled for release in 2008: ''Behavior Analysis in Sports, Health, Fitness and Behavioral Medicine'', ''the Journal of Behavior Analysis in Crime and Victim: Treatment and Prevention'' as well as the Association for Behavior Analysis International's ''Behavior Analysis in Practice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.abainternational.org/journals/behavior-analysis-in-practice.aspx | title=Behavior Analysis in Practice | publisher=abainternational.org | accessdate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional organizations==
The [[Association for Behavior Analysis]] International has a special interest group for practitioner issues, behavioral counseling, and clinical behavior analysis. The Association for Behavior Analysis International has larger special interest groups for [[autism]] and [[behavioral medicine]]. The Association for Behavior Analysis International serves as the core intellectual home for behavior analysts.&lt;ref name="Twyman07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hassert08"/&gt; The Association for Behavior Analysis International sponsors multiple conferences/year, including the annual conference, annual autism conference, biannual international conference, and other conferences on specific issues such as behavioral theory and sustainability.

The [[Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies]] (ABCT) also has an interest group in [[behavior analysis]], which focuses on clinical behavior analysis. In addition, the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies has a special interest group on addictions.

Doctoral level behavior analysts who are psychologists belong to the [[American Psychological Association]]'s division 25: [[Behavior analysis]]. APA offers a diplomate in behavioral psychology.

==Life==

Broom was born at 66 Back Sneddon Street in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], the son of John Broom, a designer of calico prints and [[Paisley design|Paisley shawls]], and Agnes Hunter Shearer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893 he married Mary Baird Baillie.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, Donald &amp; Maitland Edey. ''Lucy: The Beginnings of Humankind''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1990 {{ISBN|978-0-671-25036-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Findlay, George H. ''Robert Broom F.R.S.

In his medical studies at the University of Glasgow Broom specialised in midwifery.&lt;ref&gt;South African History online (23/03/2017) http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/robert-broom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SAHO" /&gt; After graduating in 1895 he travelled to Australia, supporting himself by practising medicine. He settled in South Africa in 1897,&lt;ref name="SAHO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Broom|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/robert-broom|website=South African History Online|accessdate=23 March 2017|date=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; just prior to the [[South African War]]. From 1903 to 1910 he was professor of Zoology and Geology at Victoria College, Stellenbosch (later [[Stellenbosch University]]), but was forced out of this position for promoting belief in evolution.&lt;ref name="SAHO" /&gt; He established a medical practice in the [[Karoo]] region of South Africa, an area rich in [[Therapsid]] fossils. Based on his continuing studies of these fossils and mammalian anatomy he was made a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1920. Following the discovery of the [[Taung child]] he became interested in the search for human ancestors and commenced work on much more recent fossils from the dolomite caves north-west of Johannesburg, particularly [[Sterkfontein]] Cave (now part of the [[Cradle of Humankind]] World Heritage Site). As well as describing many mammalian fossils from these caves he identified several hominin fossils, the most complete of which was an [[Australopithecine]] skull, nicknamed [[Mrs Ples]], and a partial skeleton that indicated that Australopithecines walked upright.&lt;ref name="SAHO" /&gt;

Broom died in [[Pretoria]], [[South Africa]] in 1951.

== Contributions ==
Broom was first known for his study of [[therapsid|mammal-like reptiles]]. After [[Raymond Dart]]'s discovery of the [[Taung Child]], an infant australopithecine, Broom's interest in paleoanthropology was heightened. Broom's career seemed over and he was sinking into poverty, when Dart wrote to [[Jan Smuts]] about the situation. Smuts, exerting pressure on the South African government, managed to obtain a position for Broom in 1934 with the staff of the [[Transvaal Museum]] in [[Pretoria]] as an Assistant in [[Palaeontology]].

In the following years, he and John T. Robinson made a series of spectacular finds, including fragments from six hominins in [[Sterkfontein]], which they named ''Plesianthropus transvaalensis'', popularly called [[Mrs. Ples]], but which was later classified as an adult ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'', as well as more discoveries at sites in [[Kromdraai]] and [[Swartkrans]]. In 1937, Broom made his [[SK 48|most famous discovery]] of ''[[Paranthropus robustus]]''. These discoveries helped support Dart's claims for the Taung species.

The remainder of Broom's career was devoted to the exploration of these sites and the interpretation of the many early hominin remains discovered there. For his volume, ''The South Africa Fossil Ape-Men, The Australopithecinae'', in which he proposed the Australopithecinae subfamily, Broom was awarded the [[Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal]] from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1946.&lt;ref name=Elliot&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal|url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_elliot|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to write to the very last. Shortly before his death he finished a monograph on the Australopithecines and remarked to his nephew:&lt;br/&gt;
::"Now that's finished ... and so am I." &lt;ref&gt;Virginia Morell, ''Ancestral Passions'', Chapter 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spiritual evolution ==

Broom was a [[nonconformist]] and was deeply interested in the [[paranormal]] and [[spiritualism]]; he was a critic of [[Darwinism]] and [[materialism]]. Broom was a believer in [[spiritual evolution]]. In his book ''The Coming of Man: Was it Accident or Design?'' (1933) he claimed that "spiritual agencies" had guided [[evolution]] as animals and plants were too complex to have arisen by chance. According to Broom, there were at least two different kinds of spiritual forces, and psychics are capable of seeing them.&lt;ref&gt;''Reconciling science and religion: the debate in the early-twentieth-century Britain'', [[Peter J. Bowler]], 2001, pp. 133-134&lt;/ref&gt; Broom claimed there was a plan and purpose in evolution and that the origin of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is the ultimate purpose behind evolution. According to Broom "Much of evolution looks as if it had been planned to result in man, and in other animals and plants to make the world a suitable place for him to dwell in."&lt;ref&gt;''Bones of contention: controversies in the search for human origins'', [[Roger Lewin]], 1997, p. 311, {{ISBN|0226476510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After discovering the skull of Mrs. Ples, Broom was asked if he excavated at random, Broom replied that [[spirits]] had told him where to find his discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;A century of Sundays: 100 years of breaking news in the Sunday times, 1906-2006, Nadine Dreyer, 2006, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chile]]an history, '''saber noise''' or '''saber rattling''' ({{lang-es|ruido de sables}}) was an incident that took place on September 3, 1924, when a group of young [[Chilean Armed Forces|military officers]] protested against the political class and the postponement of social measures by rattling the [[scabbard]]s ([[Chape|chapes]]) of their [[saber]]s against the floor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=Z4LjAAAAMAAJ|title=Las Fuerzas Armadas de Chile en la vida nacional|last=Roldán|first=Alberto Polloni|date=1972|publisher=Editorial Andrés Bello|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The term is now applied generally to cover any indication of military aggressiveness. In a sense, strategically timed [[military exercise]]s can serve as an explicit form of saber rattling, in that the extent of a country's military muscle is put up on display for other countries (namely, adversaries) to see.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Context==
In 1924, Chile was in the throes of an economic and political crisis. The economy, heavily dependent on the export of [[nitrate]]s, was suffering the effects of the discovery of artificial nitrates during [[World War I]]. At the same time, Chile was politically paralyzed by a conflict between President [[Arturo Alessandri]] and the conservatively controlled congress, who refused to discuss any of the drafts that he sent them.

On February 1, 1924, the political parties signed an agreement to change the parliamentary procedures in order to limit the censure votes (a procedure used to force cabinet ministers to resign), to allow the closure of debates by simple majority and in general to eliminate all dilatory tactics, especially those dealing with the national budget. As an additional measure, they agreed to create a parliamentary stipend (30.000 pesos for the senators, 15.000 pesos for the deputies). This program was received with public outcry, mainly because it was the only law that had been produced by the governing coalition while the social measures prepared by President Alessandri had been postponed time and again. In the Army, the news were especially bitter since they had been waiting for a salary increase for a long time. 

===''Saber noise''===
On September 3, 1924, a group of 56 young military officers (mostly lieutenants and sub-lieutenants coming from [[middle class]]es or [[working class]]es), led by Colonel [[Marmaduke Grove]] and Major [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]], attended the session where the congressional salary discussion was to take place. They quietly sat in the public tribunes, and waited for the topic to be broached. At that point the president of the chamber, feeling intimidated, demanded that the public be cleared, as the discussion was to be secret. As the officers silently started to leave, they began to rattle the scabbards (chapes) of the sabers they wore as part of their dress uniform against the floor, as a way to indicate their discontent with the political class in general, and in sign of support to Alessandri's social agenda.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Consequences==
{{see|September Junta}}

This event was the culmination of a process that marked the increasing desire by the military corps of a more active participation in Chilean politics. Since the [[1891 Chilean Civil War]], the military had been excluded although they were very dependent from all political groups for their advancement. It is also one of the events that mark the end of the so-called "[[History of Chile during the Parliamentary Era (1891-1925)|Parliamentary Republic]]" (1891-1925), also known as the "pseudo-parliamentary period" because the executive was subject to the legislative but checks and balances of executive over legislative were weakened.

The very next day the same group of young military officers involved led by Colonel [[Marmaduke Grove]] and Major [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]], created a "military committee" to defend themselves from possible punishments by the government. On September 5, the "military committee" demanded that President [[Arturo Alessandri]] dismiss three of his ministers, including the minister of War and Navy Gaspar Mora; the enactment of a [[labor law|labor code]], the passage of an [[income tax|income tax law]], and the improvement of the military salaries. 

Faced with almost open military insurrection, Alessandri had no option but to appoint General [[Luis Altamirano]], the Army Inspector General (Chief of the Army), as head of a new cabinet. On September 8, General Altamirano appeared in front of Congress to demand the passage of eight laws, including Alessandri's labor code. Congress dared not to protest, and the laws, which had been languishing for years, were passed in a matter of hours. These included the [[Eight-hour day]], suppression of [[child labour]], clear rules for [[collective bargaining]], legislation on [[occupational safety]], legalization of [[trade union]]s, a law on [[cooperative]]s and the creation of courts of conciliation and labour arbitrage.

At that point Alessandri felt that he had become just a pawn of the military, and, on September 9, he resigned and requested asylum at the US Embassy. Congress refused to accept his resignation, and instead granted him a six-months constitutional leave of absence. He left the country immediately for Italy. General Altamirano assumed power as Vice President, and on the 11th, a [[September Junta|military Junta]] was established to rule the country on the absence of the titular president, Alessandri.

Most of her work concentrates on the reinterpretation of myths. Religious history, mythology, [[Flemish primitives]] painters and also [[mannerism]] provide both the varied sources of her inspiration and the raw materials for artistic explorations.
Sabine Pigalle produces hybrid photographs in different series, mainly dedicated to the art of portraiture, that combine the contemporary with references to ancient art.

{{Zen Buddhism}}
{{buddhism}}
{{nihongo|'''''Satori'''''|悟り}} ({{zh-cp|c=[[wikt:悟|悟]]|p=wù}}; {{lang-ko|오}} ''o''; {{lang-vi|ngộ}}) is a [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhist]] term for [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]], "comprehension; understanding".&lt;ref&gt;[http://jisho.org/words?jap=&amp;eng=satori&amp;dict=edict Denshi Jisho — Online Japanese dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the Japanese verb [[satoru]].{{sfn|Suzuki|1994-A|p=88}}

In the [[Zen|Zen Buddhist]] tradition, ''satori'' refers to the experience of ''[[kenshō]]'',&lt;ref name="Kapleau"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Kapleau|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; "seeing into one's true [[Buddha-nature|nature]]". ''Ken'' means "seeing," ''shō'' means "nature" or "essence".&lt;ref name="Kapleau" /&gt;

''Satori'' and ''kenshō'' are commonly translated as [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], a word that is also used to translate [[bodhi]], [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]] and [[buddhahood]].

==Definition==
[[D. T. Suzuki]], a Japanese author of books and essays on Buddhism, Zen and Shin that were influential in the West, described ".... looking into one's nature or the opening of satori";{{sfn|Suzuki|1994-B|p=259}} and said "This acquiring of a new point of view in our dealings with life and the world is popularly called by Japanese Zen students 'satori' (''wu'' in Chinese). It is really another name for Enlightenment (''[[Enlightenment in Buddhism#Buddha's awakening|"Annuttara-samyak-sambodhi"]]'')".{{sfn|Suzuki-1994-B|p=229}}{{refn|group=note|D. T. Suzuki has been criticised for his highly idealised and inaccurate picture of Japanese Zen.{{sfn|MacRae|2003}} "Annuttara-samyak-sambodhi" is the highest state of realisation and awakening. Satori, or kensho, is a first glimpse into "nature", to be followed by further training.}}

==''Satori'' and ''kenshō''==
[[File:Satori.svg|thumb|left|70px|[[Japanese language|Japanese]] character for ''satori'']]
''Satori'' is often used interchangeably with ''kenshō''.&lt;ref name="Kapleau" /&gt; ''Kenshō'' refers to the perception of the [[Buddha-Nature]] or [[Sunyata|emptiness]]. According to some authors, ''kenshō'' is a brief glimpse, while ''satori'' is considered to be a deeper spiritual experience.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Distinct from this first insight, [[Daigo (Zen)|daigo-tettei]] is used to refer to a "deep" or lasting realization of the nature of existence.&lt;ref name="Kapleau" /&gt;

==Importance==
According to D. T. Suzuki,
{{quote|''Satori'' is the [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]] of [[Zen]], without which Zen is not Zen. Therefore every contrivance, disciplinary and doctrinal, is directed towards ''satori''.{{sfn|Suzuki|1994-A}}}}
This view is typical of [[Rinzai school|Rinzai]], which emphasizes ''satori''. The [[Sōtō|Sōtō school]] rejects this emphasis, and instead emphasizes "silent illumination" through the practice of [[zazen]].

==Attaining ''satori''==
''Satori'' is considered a "first step" or embarkation toward [[Buddhahood]]:
{{quote|Ch'an expressions refer to enlightenment as "seeing your self-nature". But even this is not enough. After seeing your self-nature, you need to deepen your experience even further and bring it into maturation. You should have enlightenment experience again and again and support them with continuous practice. Even though Ch'an says that at the time of enlightenment, your outlook is the same as of the Buddha, you are not yet a full Buddha.{{sfn|Yen|2006|p=54)}}}}

The student's mind must be prepared by rigorous study, with the use of [[koan]]s, and the practice of [[meditation]] to concentrate the mind, under the guidance of a teacher. Koans are short anecdotes of verbal exchanges between teachers and students, typically of the [[Song dynasty]], dealing with Buddhist teachings. The Rinzai-school utilizes classic collections of koans such as the [[Mumonkan|Gateless Gate]]. The Gateless Gate was assembled by the early 13th-century Chinese Zen master [[Wumen]] Hui-k'ai (無門慧開).

Wumen struggled for six years with koan "[[Mu (negative)|Zhaozhou’s dog]]", assigned to him by Yuelin Shiguan (月林師觀; Japanese: Gatsurin Shikan) (1143–1217), before attaining ''kenshō''. After his understanding had been confirmed by Yuelin, Wumen wrote the following enlightenment poem:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;A thunderclap under the clear blue sky
All beings on earth open their eyes;
Everything under heaven bows together;
[[Sumeru|Mount Sumeru]] leaps up and dances.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

{{Catholic philosophy}}
The ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' defines [[virtue]] as "a habitual and firm disposition to do the [[good]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#461/z Catechism of the Catholic Church, §1803]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the '''seven Christian virtues''' or '''heavenly virtues''' combine the four classical [[cardinal virtues]] of [[prudence]], [[Justice (virtue)|justice]], [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]] and [[courage]] (or fortitude) with the three [[theological virtues]] of [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], [[Hope (virtue)|hope]] and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]. These were adopted by the [[Church Fathers]] as the seven virtues.

==Cardinal virtues==
{{Main|Cardinal virtues}}
The Greek philosophers [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]], regarded temperance, wisdom, justice, and courage as the four most desirable character traits. The [[Book of Wisdom]] is one of the seven [[Sapiential Books]] included in the [[Septuagint]]. Wisdom 8:7 states that the fruits of Wisdom "...are virtues; For she teaches moderation and prudence, justice and fortitude, and nothing in life is more useful for men than these."

The moral virtues are attitudes, dispositions, and good habits that govern one's actions, passions, and conduct according to reason; and are acquired by human effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#461/z CCC §1804]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] said, "Virtue is the moral strength of the will in obeying the dictates of duty".&lt;ref name=Rickaby&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm Rickaby, John. "Fortitude." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 6 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The cardinal virtues are prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance.

* '''Prudence''' from {{lang|la|prudentia}} meaning "seeing ahead, sagacity") is the ability to govern and discipline oneself by the use of [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prudence Prudence – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary]. Merriam-webster.com (2012-08-31).&lt;/ref&gt; It is called the ''Auriga virtutum'' (the charioteer of the virtues) as it guides the other virtues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#462/z CCC §1806]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Justice''' is the virtue which regulates man in his dealings with others. Connected to justice are the virtues of [[Religion (virtue)|religion]], piety, and gratitude. &lt;ref name=Waldron&gt;{{catholic|title=Virtue|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15472a.htm|last=Waldron|firtst=Martin Augustine|volume=15|year=1912|accessdate=6 April 2017|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Fortitude''' which [[Thomas Aquinas]] ranks third after prudence and justice and equates with brave endurance.&lt;ref name=Rickaby/&gt; Patience and perseverance are virtues related to fortitude.
* '''Temperance''' is the virtue which moderates in accordance with reason the desires and pleasures of the sensuous appetite. Related to temperance are the virtues of continence, humility, and meekness.&lt;ref name=Waldron/&gt;

Philosophers recognized the interrelatedness of the virtues such that courage without prudence risks becoming mere foolhardiness. Aquinas found an interconnection of practical wisdom (''prudentia'') and moral virtue. This is frequently termed "the Unity of the Virtues."&lt;ref&gt;Annas, Julia. ''The Morality of Happiness'' (Oxford; Oxford University Press, 1993), pp. 73–84&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas also argued that it not only matters what a person does but how the person does it. The person must aim at a good end and also make a right choice about the means to that end. The moral virtues direct the person to aim at a good end, but to ensure that the person make the right choices about the means to a good end, one needs practical wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas. ''Commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics'', Book VI, Lecture XI, ##1279–1280&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theological virtues==
{{Main|Theological virtues}}
The traditional understanding of the differences in the natures of Cardinal and Theological virtues, is that the latter are not fully accessible to humans in their natural state without assistance from God. "All virtues have as their final scope to dispose man to acts conducive to his true happiness. The happiness, however, of which man is capable is twofold, namely, natural, which is attainable by man's natural powers, and supernatural, which exceeds the capacity of unaided human nature. Since, therefore, merely natural principles of human action are inadequate to a supernatural end, it is necessary that man be endowed with supernatural powers to enable him to attain his final destiny. Now these supernatural principles are nothing else than the theological virtues."&lt;ref name=Waldron/&gt;

==Seven virtues and the seven capital sins==

A list of seven virtues that oppose the [[seven deadly sins]] appeared later in an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] titled  ''[[Psychomachia]]'', or ''Battle/Contest of the Soul''. Written by [[Prudentius|Aurelius Clemens Prudentius]], a Christian governor who died around 410 AD, it entails the battle between good virtues and evil [[vice]]s. The enormous popularity of this work in the [[Middle Ages]] helped to spread the concept of holy virtue throughout [[Europe]].

After Pope Gregory released his list of seven deadly sins in 590 AD, the seven virtues became identified as [[chastity]], [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]], [[Charity (practice)|charity]], [[diligence]], [[patience]], [[kindness]], and [[humility]]. Practicing them is said to protect one against [[temptation]] from the seven deadly sins.

It should be noted, however, that these seven virtues do not correspond to the seven heavenly virtues arrived at by combining the cardinal and theological virtues.  Furthermore, efforts in the Middle Ages to set the seven heavenly virtues in direct opposition to the seven capital sins are both uncommon and beset with difficulties. “[T]reatises exclusively concentrating on both septenaries are actually quite rare.” and “examples of late medieval catalogues of virtues and vices which extend or upset the double heptad can be easily multiplied.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Bejczy |first1= István P. |title= The Cardinal Virtues in the Middle Ages: A Study in Moral Thought from the Fourth to the Fourteenth Century |date=2011|publisher= Brill |location=Boston|pages=228, 229}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And there are problems with this parallelism.
{{quote|The opposition between the virtues and the vices to which these works allude despite the frequent inclusion of other schemes may seem unproblematic at first sight.  The virtues and the vices seem to mirror each other as positive and negative moral attitudes, so that medieval authors, with their keen predilection for parallels and oppositions, could conveniently set them against each other. . . . Yet artistic representations such as Conrad’s trees are misleading in that they establish oppositions between the principal virtues and the capital vices which are based on mere juxtaposition.  As to content, the two schemes do not match each other.  The capital vices of lust and avarice, for instance, contrast with the remedial virtues of chastity and generosity, respectively, rather than with any theological or cardinal virtue; conversely, the virtues of hope and prudence are opposed to despair and foolishness rather than to any deadly sin.  Medieval moral authors were well aware of the fact.  Actually, the capital vices are more often contrasted with the remedial or contrary virtues in medieval moral literature than with the principal virtues, while the principal virtues are frequently accompanied by a set of mirroring vices rather than by the seven deadly sins.&lt;ref&gt;Bejczy, 2011, pp. 232-33&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Sexual assault''' is an act in which a person intentionally sexually touches another person without that person's [[consent]], or [[Coercion|coerces]] or physically forces a person to engage in a [[sexual act]] against their will.&lt;ref name="Cameron"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Peter Cameron, George Jelinek, Anne-Maree Kelly, Anthony F.

R.'' 1987 CarswellNB 25 (Supreme Court of Canada) (sexual assault defined as force without consent of a sexual nature)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Hidden because it sounds ridiculous to most people except maybe lawyers, who can rephrase this legalese better to say that sexual assault is of course an offense in all countries despite being defined differently in different countries and at different times: In legal terms, sexual assault is a [[statutory]] offense in various jurisdictions, including the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[England and Wales]], [[Ireland]], and [[Scotland]]. The legal definition of the crime of sexual assault is determined by each [[jurisdiction]]. Specific legal jurisdictions and research often use highly technical or detailed definitions of the term.--&gt;

== Definition ==
Generally, sexual assault is defined as unwanted sexual contact. The [[Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network]] defines sexual assault as "unwanted sexual contact that stops short of rape or attempted rape. This includes sexual touching and fondling."&lt;ref name="RAINN" /&gt;

The National Center for Victims of Crime states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/dna-resource-center/sexual-assault-kit-backlog-reduction/about-sexual-assault#1 |title=The National Center for Victims of Crime – Library/Document Viewer |publisher=Ncvc.org |accessdate=9 December 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720051156/http://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/dna-resource-center/sexual-assault-kit-backlog-reduction/about-sexual-assault#1 |archivedate=20 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Sexual assault takes many forms including attacks such as rape or attempted rape, as well as any unwanted sexual contact or threats. Usually a sexual assault occurs when someone touches any part of another person's body in a sexual way, even through clothes, without that person's consent.}}

In the [[United States]], the definition of sexual assault varies widely among the individual states. However, in most states sexual assault occurs when there is lack of consent from one of the individuals involved. Consent must take place between two adults who are not incapacitated and can change during any time during the sexual act.

Studies have shown that the psychological damage is particularly severe when sexual assault is committed by parents against children due to the incestuous nature of the assault.&lt;ref name="Courtois" /&gt; Incest between a child or adolescent and a related adult has been identified as the most widespread form of child sexual abuse with a huge capacity for damage to a child.&lt;ref name="Courtois" /&gt; Often, sexual assault on a child is not reported by the child for several of the following reasons:

*children are too young to recognize their victimization or put it into words
*they were threatened or bribed by the abuser

*they are afraid no one will believe them
*they blame themselves or believe the abuse is a punishment

Domestic violence is a crime of power and intimidation. It is strongly correlated with sexual assault.

Elderly sexual assault is [[victimization]] of persons over the age of 60, most of whom suffer from decreased functionality, frailty and weakness, and therefore are reliant on caretakers. Only 30 percent of people age 65 or older who are victimized report the assault to the police. The most common assailants are caretakers, adult children, spouses and fellow facility residents.
Signs that an elder is being assaulted include increased vaginal tearing, bleeding, bruising, infection, pelvic injury, soft tissue or bone injury. Also, an altered mood might be an indication of sexual assault. These symptoms include extreme agitation, post-traumatic stress disorder, withdrawal, panic attacks, STDs, exacerbation of existing illness, sleep disturbances and longer recovery times.&lt;ref name="pcar.org" /&gt;

=== Groping ===
{{Main|Groping}}
The term ''groping'' is used to define the touching or fondling of another person in a sexual way without the person's consent. Groping may occur under or over clothing.

=== Rape ===
{{Main|Rape}}

Outside of law, the term rape, "an [[assault]] by a person involving [[sexual intercourse]] with another person without that person's [[consent]]", is often used interchangeably with sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Victimology: Theories and Applications"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roberts, Albert R. |author2=Ann Wolbert Bergess |author3=CHERYL REGEHR |title=Victimology: Theories and Applications |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers |location=Sudbury, Mass |year=2009 |page=228 |isbn=978-0-7637-7210-9 |oclc= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=erFiYbLL9McC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=definition+of+rape&amp;q=definition%20of%20rape |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Violence against women"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jech.2004.022756 |title=Violence against women |year=2005 |last1=Krantz |first1=G. |journal=Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health |volume=59 |issue=10 |pages=818–21 |pmid=16166351 |last2=Garcia-Moreno |first2=C |pmc=1732916}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although closely related, the two terms are technically distinct in most jurisdictions.

=== Sexual harassment ===
{{Main|Sexual harassment}}
Sexual harassment is [[intimidation]], [[bullying]] or [[coercion]] of a sexual nature. It may also be defined as the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Paludi | first = Michele Antoinette | authorlink = |author2=Barickman, | title = Academic and Workplace Sexual Harassment | publisher = SUNY Press | year = 1991 | location = | pages = 2–5 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7914-0829-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, sexual harassment is a form of discrimination which violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The legal and social definition of what constitutes sexual harassment differ widely by culture. Sexual harassment includes a wide range of behaviors from seemingly mild transgressions to serious forms of abuse. Some forms of sexual harassment overlap with sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Dziech et al. 1990, Boland 2002&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC): "Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitutes sexual harassment when submission to or rejection of this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual's employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts About Sexual Harassment|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/facts/fs-sex.html|website=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|accessdate=18 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711064654/https://www.eeoc.gov/facts/fs-sex.html|archivedate=11 July 2017|df=dmy-all|date=2002-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*79% of victims are women, 21% are men
** 51% are harassed by a supervisor
** Business, Trade, Banking, and Finance are the biggest industries where sexual harassment occurs
** 12% received threats of termination if they did not comply with their requests
* 26,000 people in the armed forces were assaulted in 2012&lt;sup&gt;[[Sexual harassment|[18]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
** 302 of the 2,558 cases pursued by victims were prosecuted
** 38% of the cases were committed by someone of a higher rank
* Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
** [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] is a federal law that prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin, and religion. It generally applies to employers with 15 or more employees, including federal, state, and local governments. Title VII also applies to private and public colleges and universities, employment agencies, and labor organizations.&lt;sup&gt;[[Sexual harassment|[19]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
** "It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer … to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."&lt;sup&gt;[[Sexual harassment|[20]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Mass sexual assault ===
{{further|Mass sexual assault}}
Mass sexual assault takes place in public places and in crowds. It involves large groups of men surrounding and assaulting a woman, groping, manual penetration, and [[Non-penetrative sex#Frottage|frottage]], but usually stopping short of penile rape.

== Emotional effects ==
Aside from physical traumas, rape and other sexual assault often result in long-term emotional effects, particularly in child victims. These can include:
[[denial]], [[learned helplessness]], [[genophobia]], [[anger]], [[self-blame]], [[anxiety]], [[shame]], [[nightmare]]s, [[fear]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]]s, [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]], [[mood disorder|moodswings]], [[numbness]], [[promiscuity]], [[loneliness]], [[social anxiety]], difficulty trusting oneself or others, difficulty concentrating. Being the victim of sexual assault may lead to the development of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], [[addiction]], [[major depressive disorder]] or other [[psychopathology|psychopathologies]].
Family and friends experience emotional scarring including a strong desire for [[revenge]], a desire to "fix' the problem and/or move on, and a rationalization that "it wasn't that bad".&lt;ref name="pcar.org" /&gt;

== Physical effects ==
While sexual assault, including rape, can result in physical trauma, many people who experience sexual assault will not suffer any physical injury.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy KM, Heterogeneity of existing research relating to sexual violence, sexual assault and rape precludes meta-analysis of injury data. Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine. (2013), 20(5):447–459&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rape myths]] suggest that the stereotypical victim of sexual violence is a bruised and battered young woman. The central issue in many cases of rape or other sexual assault is whether or not both parties consented to the sexual activity or whether or not both parties had the capacity to do so. Thus, physical force resulting in visible physical injury is not always seen. This stereotype can be damaging because people who have experienced sexual assault but have no physical trauma may be less inclined to report to the authorities or to seek health care.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy KM, The relationship of victim injury to the progression of sexual crimes through the criminal justice system, Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine 2012:19(6):309-311&lt;/ref&gt; However, women who experienced rape or physical violence by a partner were more likely than people who had not experienced this violence to report frequent headaches, chronic pain, difficulty sleeping, activity limitation, poor physical health, and poor mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Dupain Mandi, Developing and Implementing a Sexual Assault Violence Prevention and Awareness Campaign at a State-Supported Regional University. American Journal of Health Studies. 29. 4. (2014). 264. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic effects ==
Due to rape or sexual assault, or the threat of, there are many resulting impacts on income and commerce at the macro level. Each sexual assault (excluding child abuse) costs $5,100 in tangible losses (lost productivity, medical and mental health care, police/fire services, and property damage) plus $81,400 in lost quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/victcost.pdf|title=Victim Costs and Consequences: A New Look|last=Miller, Cohen, &amp; Weirsema|first=|date=1996|website=|publisher=National Institute of Justice|access-date=September 1, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515043800/https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/victcost.pdf|archivedate=15 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue has been addressed in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In his dissenting opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[U.S. v. Morrison]]'', Justice Souter explained that 75% of women never go to the movies alone at night and nearly 50% will not ride public transportation out of fear of rape or sexual assault. It also stated that less than 1% of victims collect damages and 50% of women lose their jobs or quit after the trauma. The court ruled in ''U.S. v. Morrison'' that Congress did not have the authority to enact part of the [[Violence Against Women Act]] because it did not have a direct impact on commerce. The [[Commerce Clause]] of Article I Section VII of the [[U.S. Constitution]] gives authority and jurisdiction to the Federal government in matters of interstate commerce. As a result, the victim was unable to sue her attacker in Federal Court.

Sexual assault also has adverse economic effects for survivors on the micro level. For instance, survivors of sexual assault often require time off from work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nij.gov/publications/pages/publication-detail.aspx?ncjnumber=210346|title=Extent, Nature, and Consequences of Rape Victimization: Findings from the National Violence Against Women Survey|last=Tjaden &amp; Thoennes|first=|date=2006|website=National Institute of Justice|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs|access-date=2016-09-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916062148/http://www.nij.gov/publications/pages/publication-detail.aspx?ncjnumber=210346|archivedate=16 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and face increased rates of unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byrne|first=Christina A.|last2=Resnick|first2=Heidi S.|last3=Kilpatrick|first3=Dean G.|last4=Best|first4=Connie L.|last5=Saunders|first5=Benjamin E.|title=The socioeconomic impact of interpersonal violence on women|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|volume=67|issue=3|pages=362–366|doi=10.1037/0022-006x.67.3.362|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survivors of rape by an intimate partner lose an average of $69 per day due to unpaid time off from work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chrisler|first=Joan C.|last2=Ferguson|first2=Sheila|date=2006-11-01|title=Violence against Women as a Public Health Issue|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=1087|issue=1|pages=235–249|doi=10.1196/annals.1385.009|pmid=17189508|issn=1749-6632|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual assault is also associated with numerous negative employment consequences, including unpaid time off, diminished work performance, job loss, and inability to work, all of which can lead to lower earnings for survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loya|first=Rebecca M.|date=2015-10-01|title=Rape as an Economic Crime The Impact of Sexual Violence on Survivors' Employment and Economic Well-Being|url=http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/30/16/2793|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|language=en|volume=30|issue=16|pages=2793–2813|doi=10.1177/0886260514554291|issn=0886-2605|pmid=25381269|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118035347/http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/30/16/2793|archivedate=18 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical and psychological treatment of victims ==
In the [[emergency room]], emergency [[contraceptive]] medications are offered to women raped by men because about 5% of such rapes result in pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis&gt;{{cite book | author = Varcarolis, Elizabeth| year = 2013 | title = Essentials of psychiatric mental health nursing | location = St. Louis | publisher = Elsevier | pages = 439–442}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Preventative healthcare|Preventative]] medication against [[sexually transmitted infection]]s are given to victims of all types of sexual assault (especially for the most common diseases like [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[gonorhea]], [[trichomoniasis]] and [[bacterial vaginosis]]) and a blood serum is collected to test for STIs (such as [[HIV]], [[hepatitis B]] and [[syphilis]]).&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Any survivor with abrasions are immunized for tetanus if 5 years have elapsed since the last immunization.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Short-term treatment with a [[benzodiazepine]] may help with acute anxiety and antidepressants may be helpful for symptoms of [[PTSD]], depression and panic attacks.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) has also been proposed as a psychiatric treatment for victims of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Posmontier B, Dovydaitis T, Lipman K.

== Post-assault mistreatment of victims ==

{{Main|Post-assault treatment of sexual assault victims}}

After the assault, victims may become the target of [[slut-shaming]] to [[cyberbullying]]. In addition, their credibility may be challenged. During criminal proceedings, [[publication ban]]s and [[rape shield laws]] may operate to protect victims from excessive public scrutiny. Negative social responses to victims’ disclosures of sexual assault have the potential to lead to [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] symptoms. [[Social isolation]], following a sexual assault, can result in the victim experiencing a decrease in their [[self-esteem]] and likelihood of rejecting unwanted sexual advances in the future.&lt;ref&gt; Relyea, M., &amp; Ullman, S.

Several research based rape prevention programs have been tested and verified through scientific studies. The rape prevention programs that have the strongest empirical data in the research literature include the following:

The Men's and Women's Programs, also known as the One in Four programs, were written by John Foubert.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |last=Foubert |first=John |title=The Men's and Women's Programs: Ending Rape Through Peer Education |year=2011 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-88105-0}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is focused on increasing empathy toward rape survivors and motivating people to intervene as bystanders in sexual assault situations. Published data shows that high-risk persons who saw the Men's and Women's Program committed 40% fewer acts of sexually coercive behavior than those who didn’t. They also committed acts of sexual coercion that were 8 times less severe than a control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2202/1949-6605.1866 |title=Behavior Differences Seven Months Later: Effects of a Rape Prevention Program |year=2008 |last1=Foubert |first1=John D. |last2=Newberry |first2=Johnathan T |last3=Tatum |first3=Jerry |journal=Journal of Student Affairs Research and Practice |volume=44 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research also shows that people who saw the Men's and Women's Program reported more efficacy in intervening and greater willingness to help as a bystander after seeing the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1077801211409728 |title=The Men's Program: Does It Impact College Men's Self-Reported Bystander Efficacy and Willingness to Intervene? |year=2011 |last1=Langhinrichsen-Rohling |first1=J. |last2=Foubert |first2=J.

Bringing in the Bystander was written by Victoria Banyard. Its focus is on who bystanders are, when they have helped, and how to intervene as a bystander in risky situations. The program includes a brief empathy induction component and a pledge to intervene in the future. Several studies show strong evidence of favorable outcomes including increased bystander efficacy, increased willingness to intervene as a bystander, and decreased rape myth acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Banyard, Moynihan &amp; Plante, 2007{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banyard, Plante &amp; Moynihan, 2004{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banyard, Ward, Cohn, Plante, Moorhead, &amp; Walsh, 2007{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MVP: Mentors in Violence Prevention was written by Jackson Katz. This program focuses on discussing a male bystander who didn't intervene when woman was in danger. An emphasis is placed on encouraging men to be active bystanders rather than standing by when they notice abuse. The bulk of the presentation is on processing hypothetical scenarios. Outcomes reported in research literature include lower levels of sexism and increased belief that participants could prevent violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;Cissner, 2009{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Dot program was written by Dorothy Edwards. This program includes both motivational speeches and peer education focused on bystander intervention. Outcomes show that program participation is associated with reductions in rape myth acceptance and increased bystander intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Coker, Cook-Craig, Williams, Fisher, Clear, Garcia &amp; Hegge, 2011{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Edmonton, Canada, initiated a public education campaign aimed at potential perpetrators. Posters in bar bathrooms and public transit centers reminded men that "It's not sex when she's wasted" and "It's not sex when he changes his mind". The campaign was so effective that it spread to other cities. "The number of reported sexual assaults fell by 10 per cent last year in Vancouver, after the ads were featured around the city. It was the first time in several years that there was a drop in sexual assault activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/12/01/edmonton-sexual-assault-awareness-campaign-dont-be-that-guy_n_2224228.html|title=Edmonton Sexual Assault Awareness Campaign: 'Don't Be That Guy' So Effective City Relaunches With New Posters (PHOTOS)|website=Huffingtonpost.ca|date=December 2012|accessdate=2016-09-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902053213/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/12/01/edmonton-sexual-assault-awareness-campaign-dont-be-that-guy_n_2224228.html|archivedate=2 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden introduced in September 2014 a nationwide campaign against sexual assault entitled "It's on us". The campaign includes tips against sexual assault, as well as broad scale of private and public pledges to change to provoke a cultural shift, with a focus on student activism, to achieve awareness and prevention nationwide. UC Berkeley, NCAA and Viacom have publicly announced their partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abbott|first1=Katy|title=White House announces college-campus sexual assault awareness campaign|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2014/09/19/white-house-announces-campus-sexual-assault-awareness-campaign/|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=19 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921151622/http://www.dailycal.org/2014/09/19/white-house-announces-campus-sexual-assault-awareness-campaign/|archivedate=21 September 2014|df=dmy-all|date=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Department of Justice's National Crime Victimization Survey states that on average there are 237,868 victims (age 12 or older) of sexual assault and rape each year.

'''College'''
{{main|Campus sexual assault}}

In the United States, several studies since 1987 have indicated that one in four college women have experienced rape or attempted rape at some point in their lifetime. These studies are based on anonymous surveys of college women, not reports to the police, and the results are disputed.&lt;ref name="leaderu1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209074942/http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html |archivedate=9 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, nearly two thirds of students reported knowing victims of rape and over half reported knowing perpetrators of sexual assault. One in ten reported knowing a victim of rape when alcohol was not involved and 22.6% reported knowing a victim of alcohol-facilitated rape.&lt;ref&gt;Sorenson SB, Joshi M, Sivitz E. Knowing a sexual assault victim or perpetrator: A stratified random sample of undergraduates at one university. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 2014; 29: 394-416&lt;/ref&gt; In the documentary ''The Hunting Ground'', the prevalence of sexual assault on college campuses is brought to attention. The schools poor judicial systems are scrutinized for not helping the victims and trying to keep these issues from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=c42646ae-b960-4c12-bf53-6795dad55875%40sessionmgr107&amp;vid=14&amp;hid=107 | title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Texas A&amp;M University]] professor Jason Lindo and his colleagues analyzed over two decades worth of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] data, noting that reports of rape increased 15-57% around the times of major [[American Football]] games at [[NCAA Division I|Division 1]] schools while attempting to find a link between campus rape and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/29/the-disturbing-truth-about-college-football-and-rape/|title=The disturbing truth about college football and rape|first=Danielle|last=Paquette|publisher=The Washington Post|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825194112/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/29/the-disturbing-truth-about-college-football-and-rape/|archivedate=25 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 report from the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] titled "The Sexual Victimization of College Women" reports that 3.1% of undergraduates survived rape or attempted rape during a 6–7 month academic year with an additional 10.1% surviving rape prior to college and an additional 10.9% surviving attempted rape prior to college. With no overlap between these groups, these percentages add to 24.1%, or "One in Four".&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Cullen &amp; Turner, 2006{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koss, Gidycz &amp; Wisniewski published a study in 1987 where they interviewed approximately 6,000 college students on 32 college campuses nationwide. They asked several questions covering a wide range of behaviors. From this study 15% of college women answered "yes" to questions about whether they experienced something that met the definition of rape. An additional 12% of women answered "yes" to questions about whether they experienced something that met the definition of attempted rape, thus the statistic One in Four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.55.2.162 |title=The scope of rape: Incidence and prevalence of sexual aggression and victimization in a national sample of higher education students |year=1987 |last1=Koss |first1=Mary P. |last2=Gidycz |first2=Christine A. |last3=Wisniewski |first3=Nadine |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=162–70 |pmid=3494755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A point of contention lies in the leading nature of the questions in the study conducted by Koss, Gidycz &amp; Wisniewski. Koss herself later admitted that the question that had garnered the largest "rape" result was flawed and ultimately rendered the study invalid. Most prominently the problem was that many respondents who had answered yes to several questions had their responses treated as having been raped. The issue being that these same respondents did not feel they had been victimized and never sought redress for grievances. The resultant change shows a prevalence of only 1 in 22 college women having been raped or attempted to be raped during their time at college.&lt;ref name="leaderu1" /&gt;

In 1995, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] replicated part of this study, however they examined rape only, and did not look at attempted rape. They used a two-stage cluster sample design to produce a nationally representative sample of undergraduate college students aged greater than or equal to 18 years. The first-stage sampling frame contained 2,919 primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting of 2- and 4-year colleges and universities. The second sampling stage consisted of a random sample drawn from the primary sample unit frame enrolled in the 136 participating colleges and universities to increase the sample size to 4,609 undergraduate college students aged greater than or equal to 18 years old with a representative sample demographic matching the national demographic. Differential sampling rates of the PSU were used to ensure sufficient numbers of male and female, black and Hispanic students in the total sample population. After differential sample weighting, female students represented 55.5% of the sample; white students represented 72.8% of the sample, black students 10.3%, Hispanic students 7.1%, and 9.9% were other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/00049859.htm|title=Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance: National College Health Risk Behavior Survey -- United States, 1995|work=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=14 November 1997|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619204741/https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00049859.htm|archivedate=19 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was determined that nationwide, 13.1% of college students reported that they had been forced to have sexual intercourse against their will during their lifetime. Female students were significantly more likely than male students to report they had ever been forced to have sexual intercourse; 20% of approximately 2500 females (55% of 4,609 samples) and 3.9% of males reported experiencing rape thus far in the course of their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/07448489709595589 |title=Results from the 1995 National College Health Risk Behavior Survey |year=1997 |last1=Douglas |first1=Kathy A. |last2=Collins |first2=Janet L. |last3=Warren |first3=Charles |last4=Kann |first4=Laura |last5=Gold |first5=Robert |last6=Clayton |first6=Sonia |last7=Ross |first7=James G. |last8=Kolbe |first8=Lloyd J. |journal=Journal of American College Health |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=55–66 |pmid=9276349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies concerning the annual incidence of rape, some studies conclude an occurrence of 5%.

== By jurisdiction ==

=== Australia ===

Within Australia, the term sexual assault is used to describe a variation of sexual offences. This is due to a variety of definitions and use of terminology to describe sexual offences within territories and states as each territory and state have their own legislation to define rape, attempted rape, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, sexual penetration or intercourse without consent and sexual violence.

In the State of New South Wales, sexual assault is a statutory offence punishable under s 61I of the [[Crimes Act 1900]]. The term "sexual assault" is equivalent to "rape" in ordinary parlance, while all other assaults of a sexual nature are termed "indecent assault".

To be liable for punishment under the [[Crimes Act 1900]], an offender must intend to commit an act of sexual intercourse as defined under s 61H(1) while having one of the states of knowledge of non-consent defined under s 61HA(3). But note that s 61HA(3) is an objective standard which only require the person has no reasonable grounds for believing the other person is consenting.&lt;ref&gt;See Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s 61 HA (3)&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum penalty for sexual assault is 14 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;s 61H(1) Crimes Act 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggravated sexual assault is sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and in circumstances of aggravation. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years under s 61J of the Crimes Act.

In the state of Victoria, rape is punishable under s 38 of the Crimes Act 1958, with a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Act 1958 (VIC)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the state of South Australia, rape is punishable under s 48 of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) with a maximum term of life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the state of Western Australia, sexual penetration is punishable under s 325 the Criminal Code Act 1913 with a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code Act 1913 (WA)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Northern Territory, offences of sexual intercourse and gross indecency without consent are punishable under s 192 of the Criminal Code Act 1983 and punishable with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code Act 1983 (NT)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Queensland, rape and sexual assault are punishable under s 349, Chapter 32 of the Criminal Code Act 1899 with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code Act 1899 (QLD)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tasmania, rape is punishable under s 185 of the Criminal Code Act 1924 with a maximum punishment of 21 years under s389 of the Criminal Code Act 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code 1924 (TAS)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Australian Capital Territory, sexual assault is punishable under Part 3 of the Crimes Act 1900 with a maximum punishment of 17 years.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Act 1900 (ACT)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual assault is considered a gendered crime which results in 85% of sexual assaults never coming to the attention of the criminal justice system according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics. (2005). Personal Safety Survey. Canberra: ABS&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to low reporting rates, treatment of victims and distrust of the criminal justice system, difficulty in obtaining evidence and the belief in sexual assault myths.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, M. (2005). The law and sexual offences against adults in Australia (Issues No. 4). Melbourne: Australian Centre for the Study of Sexual Assault&lt;/ref&gt;

However, once a person is charged, the public prosecutor will decide whether the case will proceed to trial based on whether there is sufficient evidence and whether a case is in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;Lievore, D. (2005). Prosecutorial decisions in adult sexual assault cases. Trends and Issues in Crime and Criminal Justice, 291, January. Canberra: Australian Institute of Criminology&lt;/ref&gt; Once the matter has reached trial, the matter will generally be heard in the District Court. This is because sexually violent crimes are mostly categorised as indictable offences (serious offences), as opposed to summary offences (minor offences). Sexual offences can also be heard in the Supreme Court, but more generally if the matter is being heard as an appeal.

Once the matter is being heard, the prosecution must provide evidence which proves “beyond reasonable doubt” that the offence was committed by the defendant. The standard of proof is vital in checking the power of the State.&lt;ref name="aifs.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://aifs.gov.au/publications/sexual-assault-laws-australia |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306040553/https://aifs.gov.au/publications/sexual-assault-laws-australia |archivedate=6 March 2017 |df=dmy-all |date=2011-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While as previously stated that each jurisdiction (State and Territory) has its own sexual offence legislation, there are many common elements to any criminal offence that advise on how the offence is defined and what must be proven by the prosecution in order to find the defendant guilty.&lt;ref name="aifs.gov.au"/&gt; These elements are known as Actus Reus which comprises the physical element (see Ryan v Regina [1967])&lt;ref&gt;Ryan v R [1967] HCA 2; 121 CLR 205&lt;/ref&gt; and the Mens Rea which comprises the mental element (see He Kaw Teh (1985)).&lt;ref&gt;He Kaw Teh v R (1985) 157 CLR 523&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable sexual assault cases which have resulted in convictions are Regina v Bilal Skaf [2005]&lt;ref&gt;R v Bilal Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 297,16 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and Regina v Mohommed Skaf [2005]&lt;ref&gt;R v Mohommed Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 298, 16 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; which were highly visible in New South Wales within the media the 2000s. These cases were closely watched by the media and led to legislative changes such as the passing of the Crimes Amendment (Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company) Act 2001 No 62&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Amendment (Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company) Act 2001 No 62&lt;/ref&gt; which dramatically increased the sentences for ‘gang rapists’ by creating a new category of crime known as Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company. Changes were also made to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 NSW&lt;/ref&gt; This change is known as the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Victim Impact Statements) Act 2004 No 3&lt;ref&gt;Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Victim Impact Statements) Act 2004 No 3&lt;/ref&gt; which expands the category of offences in respect of which a Local Court may receive and consider Victim Impact Statements to include some indictable offences which are usually dealt with summarily.

=== Canada ===
Sexual assault is defined as sexual contact with another person without that other person's consent. Consent is defined in section 273.1(1) as "''the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question''".

Section 265 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] defines the offences of [[assault]] and sexual assault.

Section 271 criminalizes "Sexual assault", section 272 criminalizes "Sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm" and section 273 criminalizes "[[Aggravated sexual assault]]".

==== Consent ====
The absence of consent defines the crime of sexual assault. Section 273.1 (1) defines consent, section 273.1 (2) outlines certain circumstances where "no consent" is obtained, while section 273.1 (3) states that subsection (2) ''does not limit'' the circumstances where "no consent" is obtained (i.e. subsection (2) describes ''some'' circumstances which deem the act to be non-consensual, but other circumstances, not described in this section, can also deem the act as having been committed without consent). "No consent" to sexual assault is also subject to Section 265 (3), which also outlines several situations where the act is deemed non-consensual. In 2011, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in ''[[R. v. J.A.]]'' interpreted the provisions below to find that a person must have an active mind during the sexual activity in order to consent, and that they cannot give consent in advance.&lt;ref name="Criminal Code"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-6.html#anchorbo-ga:l_VIII |title=Criminal Code |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |accessdate=9 December 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109205822/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-6.html#anchorbo-ga:l_VIII |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman can't consent to sex while unconscious, Supreme Court rules |author=Mike Blanchfield |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2011/05/27/woman_cant_consent_to_sex_while_unconscious_supreme_court_rules.html |newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]] |date=27 May 2011 |accessdate=27 May 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612140715/http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2011/05/27/woman_cant_consent_to_sex_while_unconscious_supreme_court_rules.html |archivedate=12 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Meaning of “consent”''

''273.1'' (1) Subject to subsection (2) and subsection 265(3), “consent” means, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, ''the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question''.

''Where no consent obtained''

(2) No consent is obtained, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, where
(a) the agreement is expressed by the words or conduct of a person other than the complainant;
(b) the complainant is incapable of consenting to the activity;
(c) the accused induces the complainant to engage in the activity by abusing a position of trust, power or authority;
(d) the complainant expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to engage in the activity; or
(e) the complainant, having consented to engage in sexual activity, expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to continue to engage in the activity.

''Subsection (2) not limiting''

(3) Nothing in subsection (2) shall be construed as limiting the circumstances in which no consent is obtained.

*''Section 265(3)''

''Consent''

(3) For the purposes of this section, no consent is obtained where the complainant submits or does not resist by reason of
(a) the application of force to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;
(b) threats or fear of the application of force to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;
(c) fraud; or
(d) the exercise of authority.

In accordance with 265 (4) an accused may use the defence that he or she believed that the complainant consented, but such a defence may be used only when "a judge, if satisfied that there is sufficient evidence and that, if believed by the jury, the evidence would constitute a defence, shall instruct the jury when reviewing all the evidence relating to the determination of the honesty of the accused's belief, to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that belief"; furthermore according to section 273.2(b) the accused must show that he or she took reasonable steps in order to ascertain the complainant's consent, also 273.2(a) states that if the accused's belief steams from self-induced intoxication, or recklessness or wilful blindness than such belief is not a defence.&lt;ref name="Criminal Code" /&gt;

*''265 (4)''
''Accused’s belief as to consent''

(4) Where an accused alleges that he or she believed that the complainant consented to the conduct that is the subject-matter of the charge, a judge, if satisfied that there is sufficient evidence and that, if believed by the jury, the evidence would constitute a defence, shall instruct the jury, when reviewing all the evidence relating to the determination of the honesty of the accused’s belief, to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that belief.

*''Where belief in consent not a defence''

273.2 It is not a defence to a charge under section 271, 272 or 273 that the accused believed that the complainant consented to the activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge, where
(a) the accused’s belief arose from the accused’s

(i) self-induced intoxication, or

(ii) recklessness or wilful blindness; or
(b) the accused did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to the accused at the time, to ascertain that the complainant was consenting.

The Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador jury ruled in favour of a defense that added to the interpretation of the consent laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barry |first=Garrett |last2=Boone |first2=Marilyn |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/jury-deliberating-snelgrove-sexual-assault-trial-1.3997432 |title=Protest follows not guilty verdict in RNC officer Doug Snelgrove sexual assault trial |work=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=2017-02-24 |accessdate=2017-03-04 |quote=Demonstration held on court steps following verdict |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304101227/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/jury-deliberating-snelgrove-sexual-assault-trial-1.3997432 |archivedate=4 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The defenses stated and the Jury was reminded by Justice Valerie Marshall:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mullaley |first=Rosie |url=http://www.thetelegram.com/news/local/2017/2/23/case-of-police-officer-accused-of-sexually-assault-in-jurys-hand.html |title=Case of police officer accused of sexual assault in jury’s hands |work=[[The Telegram]] |date=2017-02-23 |accessdate=2017-03-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223205418/http://www.thetelegram.com/news/local/2017/2/23/case-of-police-officer-accused-of-sexually-assault-in-jurys-hand.html |archivedate=23 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
Before 1997, the definition of rape was: "''Whoever compels a woman to have extramarital intercourse with him, or with a third person, by force or the threat of present danger to life or limb, shall be punished by not less than two years’ imprisonment''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/kunarac/tjug/en/kun-tj010222e-4.htm|title=Kunarac, Vukovic and Kovac - Judgement - Part IV|website=Icty.org|accessdate=2016-09-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312233318/http://www.icty.org/x/cases/kunarac/tjug/en/kun-tj010222e-4.htm|archivedate=12 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Section 177'''
:'''Sexual assault by use of force or threats; rape'''

#Whosoever coerces another person
##by force;
##by threat of imminent danger to life or limb; or
##by exploiting a situation in which the victim is unprotected and at the mercy of the offender,
#:to suffer sexual acts by the offender or a third person on their own person or to engage actively in sexual activity with the offender or a third person, shall be liable to imprisonment of not less than one year.
#In especially serious cases the penalty shall be imprisonment of not less than two years. An especially serious case typically occurs if
##the offender performs sexual intercourse with the victim or performs similar sexual acts with the victim, or allows them to be performed on himself by the victim, especially if they degrade the victim or if they entail penetration of the body (rape); or
##the offence is committed jointly by more than one person.

Subsections (3), (4) and (5) provide additional stipulations on sentencing depending on aggravating or mitigating circumstances.

Section 178 provides that "''If the offender through sexual assault or rape (section 177) causes the death of the victim at least by gross negligence the penalty shall be imprisonment for life or not less than ten years''."

=== Republic of Ireland ===
As in many other jurisdictions, the term sexual assault is generally used to describe non-penetrative sexual offences. Section 2 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act of 1981 states that a man has committed rape if he has sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it, and at that time he knows that she does not consent to the intercourse or he is reckless as to whether she does or does not consent to it. Under Section 4 of the Criminal Law (Rape Amendment) Act of 1990, rape means a sexual assault that includes penetration (however slight) of the anus or mouth by the penis or penetration (however slight) of the vagina by any object held or manipulated by another person. The maximum penalty for rape in Ireland is imprisonment for life.&lt;ref&gt;National SATU Guidelines Development Group.

=== South Africa ===
The [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act]] created the offence of sexual assault, replacing a common-law offence of [[indecent assault]]. "Sexual assault" is defined as the unlawful and intentional sexual violation of another person without their consent. The Act's definition of "sexual violation" incorporates a number of sexual acts, including any genital contact that does not amount to penetration as well as any contact with the mouth designed to cause sexual arousal. Non-consensual acts that involve actual penetration are rape rather than sexual assault.

Unlawfully and intentionally inspiring the belief in another person that they will be sexually violated also amounts to sexual assault. The Act also created the offences of "compelled sexual assault", when a person forces a second person to commit an act of sexual violation with a third person; and "compelled self-sexual assault", when a person forces another person to masturbate or commit various other sexual acts on theirself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=77866 |title=Welcome to the official South African government online site! &amp;#124; South African Government |website=Info.gov.za |date=2016-08-11 |accessdate=2016-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629081854/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=77866 |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== England and Wales ====
Sexual assault is a statutory offence in [[England and Wales]]. It is created by section 3 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] which defines "sexual assault" as when a person (A)
{{quotation|
#intentionally touches another person (B),
#the touching is sexual,
#B does not consent to the touching, and

===== Consent =====
[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/74 Section 74] of the Sexual Offenses Act explains that "a person consents if he agrees by choice and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice".

[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/75 Section 75] clarifies what consent means

75 Evidential presumptions about consent

(1)If in proceedings for an offence to which this section applies it is proved—
(a)that the defendant did the relevant act,
(b)that any of the circumstances specified in subsection (2) existed, and
(c)that the defendant knew that those circumstances existed, the complainant is to be taken not to have consented to the relevant act unless sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue as to whether he consented, and the defendant is to be taken not to have reasonably believed that the complainant consented unless sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue as to whether he reasonably believed it.

(2)The circumstances are that—
(a)any person was, at the time of the relevant act or immediately before it began, using violence against the complainant or causing the complainant to fear that immediate violence would be used against him;
(b)any person was, at the time of the relevant act or immediately before it began, causing the complainant to fear that violence was being used, or that immediate violence would be used, against another person;
(c)the complainant was, and the defendant was not, unlawfully detained at the time of the relevant act;
(d)the complainant was asleep or otherwise unconscious at the time of the relevant act;
(e)because of the complainant’s physical disability, the complainant would not have been able at the time of the relevant act to communicate to the defendant whether the complainant consented;
(f)any person had administered to or caused to be taken by the complainant, without the complainant’s consent, a substance which, having regard to when it was administered or taken, was capable of causing or enabling the complainant to be stupefied or overpowered at the time of the relevant act.

(3)In subsection (2)(a) and (b), the reference to the time immediately before the relevant act began is, in the case of an act which is one of a continuous series of sexual activities, a reference to the time immediately before the first sexual activity began.

=== United States ===
The United States Department of Justice defines sexual assault as "any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient. Falling under the definition of sexual assault are sexual activities as forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, and attempted rape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Assault|url=https://www.justice.gov/ovw/sexual-assault|website=United States Department of Justice|accessdate=14 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010230428/https://www.justice.gov/ovw/sexual-assault|archivedate=10 October 2016|df=dmy-all|date=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sincerity''' is the [[virtue]] of one who communicates and acts in accordance with  their feelings, beliefs, thoughts, and desires.

== Etymology ==
The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] and most scholars state that ''sincerity'' from ''sincere'' is derived from the Latin ''sincerus'' meaning ''clean, pure, sound'' (1525–35). ''Sincerus'' may have once meant "one growth" (not mixed), from ''sin-'' (one) and ''crescere'' (to grow).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=sincerity&amp;searchmode=none Etymonline.com]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Crescere'' is cognate with "[[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]]," the goddess of grain, as in
"cereal."&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;Bob Edwards. ''Origin of the word cereal.'' [[National Public Radio]] (NPR). Show: Morning Edition (11:00 AM on ET) October 21, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[American Heritage Dictionary]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE223.html Bartleby.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017122344/http://bartleby.com/61/roots/IE223.html |date=2007-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Latin word ''sincerus'' is derived from the Indo-European root ''*sm̥kēros'', itself derived from the zero-grade of ''*sem'' (''one'') and the suffixed, lengthened e-grade of ''*ker'' (''grow''), generating the underlying meaning ''of one growth'', hence ''pure, clean.''

=== Controversy ===
An often repeated [[false etymology|folk etymology]] proposes that ''sincere'' is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''sine'' = ''without'', ''cera'' = ''wax''.  According to one popular explanation, dishonest sculptors in [[Rome]] or [[Greece]] would cover flaws in their work with wax to deceive the viewer; therefore, a sculpture "without wax" would mean honesty in its perfection. In its early days the word could refer to the immaterial and material. "One spoke of sincere wine...simply to mean that it had not been adulterated, or, as was once said, sophisticated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sincerity and Authenticity|last=Trilling|first=Lionel|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1972|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another explanation is that this etymology "is derived from a Greeks-bearing-gifts story of deceit and betrayal. For the feat of victory, the Romans demanded the handing over of obligatory tributes. Following bad advice, the Greeks resorted to some faux-marble statues made of wax, which they offered as tribute. These promptly melted in the warm Greek sun."&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Wajnryb. "[http://www.smh.com.au/news/words/if-you-hear-buzzing-get-the-wax-out-of-your-ears/2006/11/16/1163266707150.html If you hear buzzing, get the wax out of your ears]"; Words. ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' (Australia). Spectrum; Books; Pg. 32. November 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] states, however, that "there is no probability in the old explanation from sine cera 'without wax'".

The popularity of the ''without wax'' etymology is reflected in its use as a minor subplot in [[Dan Brown]]'s 1998 thriller novel ''[[Digital Fortress]]'', though Brown attributes it to the [[Spanish language]], not Latin. Reference to the same etymology, this time attributed to Latin, later appears in his 2009 novel, ''[[The Lost Symbol]]''.

==In Western societies==
First discussed by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics#Book 4: Other virtues|Nicomachean Ethics]]'', it resurfaced to become an ideal ([[virtue]]) in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] in the 17th century; and it gained considerable momentum during the [[Romantic movement]], when sincerity was first celebrated as an [[artistic]] and social ideal.  Indeed, in middle to late nineteenth century America, sincerity was an idea reflected in mannerisms, hairstyles, women's dress, and the literature of the time.

More recently sincerity has been under assault by several modern developments such as [[psychoanalysis]] and [[postmodern]] developments such as [[deconstruction]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Some scholars view sincerity as a [[wikt:construct|construct]] rather than a moral virtue—although any virtue can be construed as a 'mere construct' rather than an actual phenomenon{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Because knowledge of self is necessarily subjective, the philosopher Harry Frankfurt has argued that "sincerity itself is bullshit"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56632137|title=On bullshit|last=Frankfurt|first=Harry G.,|date=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691122946|location=Princeton, NJ|oclc=56632137}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Literary critic [[Lionel Trilling]] dealt with the subject of sincerity, its roots, its evolution, its moral quotient, and its relationship to [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] in a series of lectures published under the title ''[[Sincerity and Authenticity]]''.

===Aristotle's views===
According to Aristotle "[[Honesty|truthfulness]] or sincerity is a desirable mean state between the deficiency of [[irony]] or [[self-deprecation]] and the excess of [[boast]]fulness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/ethics/section4.rhtml Sparknotes.com, Ethics, Section 4. Last visited, April 25, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bwq6k-MunOAC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=nicomachean+ethics+and+sincerity&amp;source=web&amp;ots=60d52vT2aj&amp;sig=EppbqkTveUFX6TKx2l0eHMhZwgI&amp;hl=en Google Books Nicomachean Ethics, Book 4, p. 103, 1127b3-31 by Aristotle]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Confucian societies==
''See'' '''''[[w:The Analects|The Analects]]'''''

Beyond the [[Western culture]], sincerity is notably developed as a virtue in [[Confucian]] societies ([[China]], [[Korea]], and [[Japan]]). The concept of ''chéng'' (誠、诚) — as expounded in two of the Confucian classics, the ''Da Xue'' and the ''Zhong Yong'' — is generally translated as ''sincerity''. As in the West, the term implies a congruence of avowal and inner feeling, but inner feeling is in turn ideally responsive to ritual propriety and [[social hierarchy]]. Specifically, Confucian's ''Analects'' contains the following statement in Chapter I: (主忠信。毋友不如己者。過，則勿憚改。) "Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. Then no friends would not be like yourself (all friends would be as loyal as yourself). If you make a mistake, do not be afraid to correct it."

Thus, even today, a powerful leader will praise leaders of other realms as "sincere" to the extent that they ''know their place'' in the sense of fulfilling a role in the drama of life. In Japanese the character for ''cheng'' may be pronounced ''makoto'', and carries still more strongly the sense of loyal avowal and belief.

'''Solar conjunction''' occurs when a [[planet]] or other [[solar system]] object is on the opposite side of the [[sun]] from the [[Earth]].  From an Earth reference, the sun will pass between the Earth and the object. Communication with any [[spacecraft]] in solar conjunction will be severely limited due to the sun's interference on radio transmissions from the spacecraft.&lt;ref name=lat20130405&gt;
{{cite news |last=Khan|first=Amina |title=NASA Mars Curiosity rover gets to work on 'spring break' chores|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-mars-curiosity-working-conjunction-spring-break-20130405,0,2992673.story |accessdate=2013-04-07 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=2013-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When in reference to Satellite Communications, solar conjunction occurs when the sun is directly in line with an orbiting Satellite and the terrestrial receiving station.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Spacecraft-related issues==
There is also a risk that an antenna equipped with auto-tracking will begin following the sun's movements instead of the satellite once they are no longer inline with each other. This is because the Sun acts as a large electromagnetic noise generator which creates a signal much stronger than the satellite's tracking signal{{Citation needed|reason=UNdue weight - this would only make sense if using a dumb max-signal tracker. May not be valid with modern systems|date=April 2013}}.
A recent example of limitations caused by the solar conjunction occurred when the [[NASA]]-[[JPL]] team put the [[Curiosity rover]] on [[Mars|Mars']] surface in [[autonomous]] operation mode for 25 days during the conjunction. In autonomous mode [[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity]] suspends all movements and active science operations but retain communication-independent experiments (e.g. record atmospheric and radiation data).

The term can also refer to the passage of the line of sight to an interior planet ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] or [[Venus]]) being very close to the solar disk. If the planet passes directly in front of the sun, a [[Astronomical transit|solar transit]] occurs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28361">In [[mathematics]] a '''stack''' or '''2-sheaf''' is, roughly speaking, a [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] that takes values in categories rather than sets. Stacks are used to formalise some of the main constructions of [[descent theory]], and to construct fine moduli stacks when [[fine moduli space]]s do not exist.

Descent theory is concerned with generalisations of situations where [[isomorphism|isomorphic]], compatible geometrical objects (such as [[vector bundle]]s on [[topological space]]s) can be "glued together" within a restriction of the topological basis. In a more general set-up the restrictions are replaced with [[Pullback (category theory)|pullbacks]]; [[fibred category|fibred categories]] then make a good framework to discuss the possibility of such gluing. The intuitive meaning of a stack is that it is a fibred category such that "all possible gluings work". The specification of gluings requires a definition of coverings with regard to which the gluings can be considered. It turns out that the general language for describing these coverings is that of a [[Grothendieck topology]]. Thus a stack is formally given as a fibred category over another ''base'' category, where the base has a Grothendieck topology and where the fibred category satisfies a few axioms that ensure existence and uniqueness of certain gluings with respect to the Grothendieck topology.

==Overview==
Stacks are the underlying structure of algebraic stacks (also called Artin stacks) and Deligne–Mumford stacks, which generalize [[Scheme (mathematics)|schemes]] and [[algebraic space]]s and which are particularly useful in studying [[moduli space]]s. There are inclusions: schemes ⊆ algebraic spaces ⊆ Deligne–Mumford stacks ⊆ algebraic stacks (Artin stacks) ⊆ stacks.

{{harvtxt|Edidin|2003}} and {{harvtxt|Fantechi|2001}} give a brief introductory accounts of stacks, {{harvtxt|Gómez|2001}}, {{harvtxt|Olsson|2007}} and  {{harvtxt|Vistoli|2005}} give more detailed introductions, and {{harvtxt|Laumon|Moret-Bailly|2000}} describes the more advanced theory.

==Motivation and history==

{{quotebox|width=30%|
quote=La conclusion pratique à laquelle je suis arrivé dès maintenant, c'est que chaque fois que en vertu de mes critères, une variété de modules (ou plutôt, un schéma de modules) pour la classification des variations (globales, ou infinitésimales) de certaines structures (variétés complètes non singulières, fibrés vectoriels, etc.) ne peut exister, malgré de bonnes hypothèses de platitude, propreté, et non singularité éventuellement, la raison en est seulement l'existence d'automorphismes de la structure qui empêche la technique de descente de marcher.
|source=Grothendieck's letter to Serre, 1959 Nov 5.}}
The concept of stacks has its origin in the definition of effective descent data in {{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1959}}.
In a 1959 letter to Serre, Grothendieck observed that a fundamental  obstruction to constructing good moduli spaces is the existence of automorphisms. A major motivation for stacks is that if a moduli space for some problem does not exist because of the existence of automorphisms, it may still be possible to construct a moduli stack.

{{harvtxt|Mumford|1965}} studied the Picard group of the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves]], before stacks had been defined. Stacks were first defined by  {{harvs|txt|last=Giraud|year1=1966|year2=1971}}, and the term "stack" was introduced by {{harvtxt|Deligne|Mumford|1969}} for the original French term "champ" meaning "field". In this paper they also introduced '''Deligne–Mumford stacks''', which they called algebraic stacks, though the term "algebraic stack" now usually refers to the more general '''Artin stacks''' introduced by {{harvs|txt|author-link=Michael Artin|last=Artin|year=1974}}.

When defining quotients of schemes by group actions, it is often impossible for the quotient to be a scheme and still satisfy desirable properties for a quotient. For example, if a few points have non-trivial stabilisers, then the [[categorical quotient]] will not exist among schemes.

In the same way, [[moduli space]]s of curves, vector bundles, or other geometric objects are often best defined as stacks instead of schemes.  Constructions of moduli spaces often proceed by first constructing a larger space parametrizing the objects in question, and then [[quotient stack|quotienting by group action]] to account for objects with automorphisms which have been overcounted.

==Definitions==

A category &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; with a functor to a category &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is called a [[fibered category]] over &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; if for any morphism &lt;math&gt;F:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and any object &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; with image &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; (under the functor), there is a pullback &lt;math&gt;f:x\to y&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. This means a morphism with image &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; such that any morphism &lt;math&gt;g:z\to y&lt;/math&gt; with image &lt;math&gt;G=F\circ H&lt;/math&gt; can be factored as &lt;math&gt;g=f\circ h&lt;/math&gt; by a unique morphism &lt;math&gt;h:z\to x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that the functor maps &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. The element &lt;math&gt;x = F^*y&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''pullback''' of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and is unique up to canonical isomorphism.

The category ''c'' is called a '''[[prestack]]''' over a category ''C'' with a [[Grothendieck topology]] if it is fibered over ''C'' and for any object ''U'' of ''C'' and objects ''x'', ''y'' of ''c'' with image ''U'', the functor from objects over ''U'' to sets taking ''F'':''V''→''U'' to Hom(''F''*''x'',''F''*''y'') is a sheaf. This terminology is not consistent with the terminology for sheaves: prestacks are the analogues of separated presheaves rather than presheaves.

The category ''c'' is called a '''stack''' over the category ''C'' with a Grothendieck topology if it is a prestack over ''C'' and every descent datum is effective. A '''descent datum''' consists roughly of a covering of an object ''V'' of ''C'' by a family ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', elements ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the fiber over ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', and morphisms ''f&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt;'' between the restrictions of ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''V&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''=''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''×&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt;''V&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' satisfying the compatibility condition ''f&lt;sub&gt;ki&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''f&lt;sub&gt;kj&lt;/sub&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt;''. The descent datum is called '''effective''' if the elements ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are essentially the pullbacks of an element ''x'' with image ''V''.

A stack is called a '''stack in groupoids''' or a '''(2,1)-sheaf''' if it is also fibered in groupoids, meaning that its fibers (the inverse images of objects of ''C'') are groupoids. Some authors use the word "stack" to refer to the more restrictive notion of a stack in groupoids.

An '''algebraic stack''' or '''Artin stack''' is a stack in groupoids ''X'' over the etale site such that the diagonal map of ''X'' is representable and there exists a smooth surjection from (the stack associated to) a scheme to X.
A morphism ''Y''&lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''X'' of stacks is '''representable''' if, for every morphism ''S'' &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''X'' from (the stack associated to) a scheme to X, the [[fiber product]] ''Y''&amp;nbsp;×&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''S'' is isomorphic to (the stack associated to) an [[algebraic space]]. The '''fiber product''' of stacks is defined using the usual [[universal property]], and changing the requirement that diagrams commute to the requirement that they [[2-commute]]. See also [[morphism of algebraic stacks]] for further information.

The motivation behind the representability of the diagonal is the following: the diagonal morphism &lt;math&gt;\Delta:\mathfrak{X} \to \mathfrak{X}\times\mathfrak{X}&lt;/math&gt; is representable if and only if for any pair of morphisms of algebraic spaces &lt;math&gt;X,Y \to \mathfrak{X}&lt;/math&gt;, their fiber product &lt;math&gt;X\times_{\mathfrak{X}}Y&lt;/math&gt; is representable.

A '''[[Deligne–Mumford stack]]''' is an algebraic stack ''X'' such that there is an étale surjection  from a scheme to ''X''.
Roughly speaking, Deligne–Mumford stacks can be thought of as algebraic stacks whose objects have no infinitesimal automorphisms.

==Examples==
*If the fibers of a stack are sets (meaning categories whose only morphisms are identity maps) then the stack is essentially the same as a sheaf of sets. This shows that a stack is a sort of generalization of a sheaf, taking values in arbitrary categories rather than sets.
*More concretely, let ''h'' be a contravariant  functor from the category ''C'' of all schemes over some fixed base scheme to the category of sets. Then it [[Grothendieck construction|determines]] the following category ''H'':
:# an object is a pair (''S'', ''s'') consisting of a scheme ''S'' in ''C'' and an element ''s'' of the set ''h''(''S'')
:# a morphism (''S'', ''s'') → (''T'', ''t'') consists of a morphism ''φ'': ''S'' → ''T'' in ''C'' such that ''h''(''φ'')(''t'')= ''s''.
:Via the forgetful functor ''p'': ''H'' → ''C'', the category ''H'' is a [[fibered category|category fibered]] over ''C''. For example, if ''X'' is a scheme in ''C'', then it determines the contravariant functor &lt;math&gt;h = \operatorname{Hom}(-, X)&lt;/math&gt; and the corresponding fibered category is the '''{{vanchor|stack associated to ''X'''''|stack associated to a scheme}}. Stacks (or prestacks) can be constructed as a variant of this construction.

*Any scheme with quasi-compact diagonal is an algebraic stack (or more precisely represents one) since every scheme has an action by the trivial group.
*The [[moduli stack of vector bundles]]: the category of vector bundles ''V''→''S'' is a stack over the category of  topological spaces ''S''. A morphism from ''V''→''S'' to ''W''→''T'' consists of continuous maps from ''S'' to ''T'' and from ''V'' to ''W'' (linear on fibers) such that the obvious square commutes.  The condition that this is a fibered category follows because one can take pullbacks of vector bundles over continuous maps of topological spaces, and the condition that a descent datum is effective follows because one can construct a vector bundle over a space by gluing together vector bundles on elements of an open cover.
*The stack of quasi-coherent sheaves on schemes (with respect to the [[fpqc-topology]] and weaker topologies)
*The stack of affine schemes on a base scheme (again with respect to the fpqc topology or a weaker one)
*{{harvtxt|Mumford|1965}} studied the [[moduli stack of elliptic curves|moduli stack M&lt;sub&gt;1,1&lt;/sub&gt; of elliptic curves]], and showed that its Picard group is cyclic of order 12. For elliptic curves over the [[complex number]]s the corresponding stack is similar to a quotient  of the [[upper half-plane]] by the action of the [[modular group]].
*The [[moduli space of algebraic curves]] M&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; defined as a universal family of smooth curves of given [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] ''g'' does not exist as an algebraic variety because in particular there are curves admitting nontrivial automorphisms. However there is a moduli stack  M&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; which is a good substitute for the non-existent fine moduli space of smooth genus ''g'' curves. More generally there is a moduli stack M&lt;sub&gt;''g'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of genus ''g'' curves with ''n'' marked points. In general this is an algebraic stack, and is a Deligne–Mumford stack for ''g≥''2 or  ''g''=1,''n''&gt;0 or ''g''=0, ''n''≥3 (in other words when the automorphism groups of the curves are finite). This moduli stack has a completion consisting of the moduli stack of stable curves (for given ''g'' and ''n'') which is proper over Spec '''Z'''.  For example, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the classifying stack BPGL(2) of the projective general linear group. (There is a subtlety in defining ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, as one has to use algebraic spaces rather than schemes to construct it.)
*A [[gerbe]] is a stack in groupoids; for example the trivial gerbe that assigns to each scheme the principal ''G''-bundles over the scheme, for some group ''G''.
*If ''Y'' is a scheme and ''G'' is a smooth affine group scheme acting on ''Y'', then there is a [[quotient algebraic stack]] ''Y''/''G'', taking a scheme ''T'' to the groupoid of ''G''-torsors over ''T'' with ''G''-equivariant maps to ''Y''. Explicitly, given a space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-action, form the stack &lt;math&gt;[X/G]&lt;/math&gt; which (intuitively speaking) [[pseudo-functor|sends]] a space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; to the groupoid of pullback diagrams
::&lt;math&gt;[X/G](Y) = \begin{Bmatrix}
Z &amp; \xrightarrow{\Phi} &amp; X \\
\downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow \\
Y &amp; \xrightarrow{\phi} &amp; [X/G]
\end{Bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-equivariant morphism of spaces and &lt;math&gt;Z \to Y&lt;/math&gt;is a principal &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-bundle. The morphisms in this category are just morphisms of diagrams where the arrows on the right-hand side are equal and the arrows on the left-hand side are morphisms of principal &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-bundles.

*A special case of this when ''Y'' is a point gives the [[classifying stack]] ''BG'' of a smooth affine group scheme ''G'': &lt;math&gt;\textbf{B}G := [pt/G].&lt;/math&gt; It is named so since the category &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}G(X)&lt;/math&gt;, the fiber over ''X'', is precisely the category &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Bun}_G(X)&lt;/math&gt; of principal &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-bundles over &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Bun}_G(X)&lt;/math&gt; itself can be considered as a stack, the [[moduli stack of principal bundles|moduli stack of principal ''G''-bundles on ''X'']].
*An important subexample from this construction is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}GL_n&lt;/math&gt; which is the moduli stack of principal &lt;math&gt;GL_n&lt;/math&gt;-bundles. Since the data of a principal &lt;math&gt;GL_n&lt;/math&gt;-bundle is equivalent to the data of a rank &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vector bundle, this is isomorphic to the [[moduli stack of vector bundles|moduli stack of rank &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vector bundles &lt;math&gt;Vect_n&lt;/math&gt;]].
&lt;!--* An example of a stack which is not globally a quotient stack is the disjoint union of two quotient stacks which have non-equal quotienting group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;; e.g. consider &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}/2 \coprod \mathbf{B}S_3&lt;/math&gt;.

What should be done with this?
--&gt;
*An example of a non-affine stack is given by the half-line with two stacky origins. This can be constructed as the colimit of two inclusion of &lt;math&gt; [\mathbb{G}_m/ (\mathbb{Z}/2)] \to [\mathbb{A}^1/(\mathbb{Z}/2)]&lt;/math&gt;.
*Stacky curves, or [[Orbifold|orbicurves]], can be constructed by taking the stack quotient of a morphism of curves by the monodromy group of the cover over the generic points. For example, take a projective morphism
::&lt;math&gt;\text{Proj}(\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/(x^5 + y^5 + z^5)) \to \text{Proj}(\mathbb{C}[x,y])&lt;/math&gt;
:which is generically [[Étale morphism|etale]]. The stack quotient of the domain gives a stacky &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^1&lt;/math&gt; with stacky points that have stabilizer group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/5&lt;/math&gt; at the fifth roots of unity in the &lt;math&gt;x/y&lt;/math&gt;-chart since these are the points where the cover ramifies.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Quasi-coherent sheaves on algebraic stacks==

On an algebraic stack one can construct a category of quasi-coherent sheaves similar to the category of quasi-coherent sheaves over a scheme.

A quasi-coherent sheaf is roughly one that looks locally like the [[sheaf of a module]] over a ring. The first problem is to decide what one means by "locally": this involves the choice of a Grothendieck topology, and there are many possible choices for this, all of which have some problems and none of which seem completely satisfactory. The Grothendieck topology should be strong enough so that the stack is locally affine in this topology: schemes are locally affine in the Zariski topology so this is a good choice for schemes as Serre discovered,  algebraic spaces and Deligne–Mumford stacks are locally affine in the etale topology so one usually uses the etale topology for these, while algebraic stacks are locally affine in the smooth topology so one can use the smooth topology in this case. For general algebraic stacks the etale topology does not have enough open sets: for example, if G is a smooth connected group then the only etale covers of the classifying stack BG are unions of copies of BG, which are not enough to give the right theory of quasicoherent sheaves.

Instead of using the smooth topology for algebraic stacks one often uses a modification of it called the [[Smooth topology|Lis-Et topology]] (short for Lisse-Etale: lisse is the French term for smooth), which has the same open sets as the smooth topology but the open covers are given by etale rather than smooth maps. This usually seems to lead to an equivalent category of quasi-coherent sheaves, but is easier to use: for example it is easier to compare with the etale topology on algebraic spaces.  The Lis-Et topology has a subtle technical problem: a morphism between stacks does not in general give a morphism between the corresponding topoi. (The problem is that while one can construct a pair of adjoint functors ''f''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''*, as needed for a geometric morphism of topoi, the functor ''f''* is not left exact in general. This problem is notorious for having caused some errors in published papers and books.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Olsson, Martin (2007), ''Sheaves on Artin Stacks''.&lt;/ref&gt;) This means that constructing the pullback of a quasicoherent sheaf under a morphism of stacks requires some extra effort.

It is also possible to use finer topologies. Most reasonable "sufficiently large" Grothendieck topologies seem to lead to equivalent categories of quasi-coherent sheaves, but the larger a topology is the harder it is to handle, so one generally prefers to use smaller topologies as long as they have enough open sets. For example, the big fppf topology leads to essentially the same category of quasi-coherent sheaves as the Lis-Et topology, but has a subtle problem: the natural embedding of quasi-coherent sheaves into O&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; modules in this topology is not exact (it does not preserve kernels in general).

==Other types of stack==

'''[[Differentiable stack]]s''' and '''topological stacks''' are defined in a way similar to algebraic stacks, except that the underlying category of affine schemes is replaced by the category of smooth manifolds or topological spaces.

More generally one can define the notion of an ''n''-sheaf or ''n''–1 stack, which is roughly a sort of sheaf taking values in ''n''–1 categories. There are several inequivalent ways of doing this. 1-sheaves are the same as sheaves, and 2-sheaves are the same as stacks. They are called [[higher stack]]s.

A very similar and analogous extension is to develop the stack theory on non-discrete objects (i.e., a space is really a [[spectrum (topology)|spectrum]] in algebraic topology). The resulting stacky objects are called [[derived stack]]s (or spectral stacks). [[Jacob Lurie]]'s under-construction book ''Spectral Algebraic Geometry'' studies a generalization which he calls a [[spectral Deligne–Mumford stack]]. By definition, it is a ringed [[∞-topos]] that is étale-locally the [[étale spectrum]] of an [[E-infinity ring|'''E'''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-ring]] (this notion subsumes that of a [[derived scheme]], at least in characteristic zero.)

==Set-theoretical problems==

There are some minor set theoretical problems with the usual foundation of the theory of stacks, because stacks are often defined as certain functors to the category of sets and are therefore not sets. There are several ways to deal with this problem:

*One can work with Grothendieck universes: a stack is then a functor between classes of some fixed Grothendieck universe, so these classes and the stacks are sets in a larger Grothendieck universe. The drawback of this approach is that one has to assume the existence of enough Grothendieck universes, which is essentially a [[large cardinal]] axiom.
*One can define stacks as functors to the set of sets of sufficiently large rank, and keep careful track of the ranks of the various sets one uses. The problem with this is that it involves some additional rather tiresome bookkeeping.
*One can use reflection principles from set theory stating that one can find set models of any finite fragment of the axioms of ZFC to show that one can automatically find sets that are sufficiently close approximations to the universe of all sets.
*One can simply ignore the problem. This is the approach taken by many authors.

'''System requirements''' in [[spacecraft systems]] are the specific [[system requirements]] needed to design and operate a [[spacecraft]] or a [[Spacecraft#Subsystems|spacecraft subsystem]].

== Overview ==
[[Image:Systems Engineering Process II.svg|thumb|300px|The [[V-Model]] of the general Systems Development Life Cycle.&lt;ref name="FHWA 05"&gt;[http://www.itsdocs.fhwa.dot.gov/jpodocs/repts_te/14158.htm ''Clarus Concept of Operations.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705102900/http://www.itsdocs.fhwa.dot.gov/jpodocs/repts_te/14158.htm |date=2009-07-05 }} Publication No. FHWA-JPO-05-072, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), 2005&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Spacecraft system]]s are normally developed under the responsibility of space agencies as [[NASA]], [[ESA]] etc. In the space area standardized terms and processes have been introduced to allow for unambiguous communication between all partners and efficient usage of all documents. For instance the [[Systems Development Life Cycle|life cycle]] of space systems is divided in phases:{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}
* Phase A:   Feasibility Study
* Phase B:   Requirements Definition
* Phase C/D: Design / Manufacturing / Verification
* Phase E:   Operational usage.
At the end of phase B the system requirements together with a [[statement of work]] are sent out requesting proposals from industry.

=== Technical systems requirement ===
The technical system requirements documented in the System Specification stay on mission level:{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}
* System functions and performances
* Orbit
* Launch vehicle
* etc.
whereas the non-technical system (task) requirements 
* Cost and progress reporting
* Documentation maintenance
* etc.
are contained in the statement of work.

The customer (requirements) specification is answered by the contractor by a design-to specification.

For example, the requirement "Columbus shall be launched by the Space Shuttle." is detailed in the contractor system specification "Columbus shall be a cylindrical pressurized module with max. length of 6.9 meters and 4.5 meters diameter as agreed in the Shuttle/Columbus ICD."

[[Image:Requirements Allocation Sheet.jpg|thumb|600px|center|Systems requirements can be specified in a "Requirements Allocation Sheet".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211165311/http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf |date=2006-02-11 }} Defense Acquisition University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Operations environment ===
The spacecraft's systems specification, according to David Michael Harland (2005), usually also defines the operation environment of the spacecraft. It mostly is defined "as a model - often provide by the scientific community from available data - in the form of a set of curves, numerical tables, or software, usually with a nominal expectation and the minimal and maximum profiles which the environment is not expected to exceed".&lt;ref&gt;David Michael Harland, Ralph Lorenz (2005), ''Space Systems Failures: Disasters and Rescues of Satellites, Rockets'', Springer, p.178.&lt;/ref&gt;

== System specification structure ==
A typical industry generated [[Specification (technical standard)|system specification]] for a spacecraft has the following structure (e.g. Columbus Design Spec (COL-RIBRE-SPE-0028, iss.10/F, 06.25.2004):
* Document change record
* 1. Scope
** 1.1 Purpose
** 1.2 Summary description
** 1.3 Classification
** 1.4 Applicability
* 2. Related documents
** 2.1 Applicable documents (incl. order of precedence)
** 2.2 Reference documents
* 3. Functional /Performance Requirements
* 4. Support requirements
** 4.1 Product assurance
** 4.2 Electro-magnetic compatibility
** 4.3 Contamination
** 4.4 etc.
* 5. Interface requirements
** 5.1 System interfaces
*** 5.1.1 Launcher
*** 5.1.2 Ground stations
*** 5.1.3 etc.
** 5.2 Subsystem interfaces
*** 5.2.1 Electrical power
*** 5.2.2 Data
*** 5.2.3 etc.
* 6. Implementation requirements
** 6.1 Configuration
** 6.2 Budget Allocations
*** 6.2.1 Mass
*** 6.2.2 Electrical power
*** 6.2.3 etc.
* 7. Preparation for delivery
* Attachments (Abbreviation list etc.)

Each requirement paragraph consists of the requirement to be fulfilled by the product to be delivered and the verification requirement (Review of design, analysis, test, inspection).

== Specification tree ==
The spacecraft system specification defines also the subsystems of the spacecraft e.g.:{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}
* Structure
* Data management subsystem incl. software
* Electrical Power
* Mechanical
* etc.
For each subsystem a subsystem specification is prepared by the Prime Contractor with the same specification structure shown above including references to the parent paragraph in the system specification. In the same way the subsystem contractor prepares an assembly or unit specification. All these specifications are listed in a so-called [[specification tree]] showing all specifications and their linkage as well as the issue / date of each specification.

'''''The Astrology of Personality''''' is a book by [[Dane Rudhyar]] first published in New York in 1936 by Lucis Publishing Company ([[Lucis Trust]]). It was subsequently released in 1963 in the Netherlands by Servire/Wassenaar and again with a new preface in New York in 1970 by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]].  The book discusses [[astrology]] from a psychological or "person-centered" perspective as opposed to the physiological and elemental perspective of many works on astrology.

Mostly recently, (2004), it has been published by Kessinger Publishing Co.&lt;ref&gt;Rudhyar, Dane, [http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/products/dane+rudhyar/the+astrology+of+personality/5219098/ The Astrology of Personality: A Reformulation of Astrological Concepts and Ideals in Terms of Contemporary Psychology and Philosophy 1936], October 2004, Kessinger Publishing Co. {{ISBN|978-1-4179-7846-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2901">In [[mathematics]], an '''unordered pair''' or '''pair set''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of the form {''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''}, i.e. a set having two elements ''a'' and&amp;nbsp;''b'' with no particular relation between them. In contrast, an [[ordered pair]] (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'') has ''a'' as its first element and ''b'' as its second element. 

While the two elements of an ordered pair (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'') need not be distinct, modern authors only call {''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''} an unordered pair if ''a''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''b''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
But for a few authors a [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] is also considered an unordered pair, although today, most would say that {a,a} is a [[multiset]]. It is typical to use the term unordered pair even in the situation where the elements a and b could be equal, as long as this equality has not yet been established.

A set with precisely two elements is also called a [[finite set|2-set]] or (rarely) a '''binary set'''.

An unordered pair is a [[finite set]]; its [[cardinality]] (number of elements) is 2 or (if the two elements are not distinct)&amp;nbsp;1.

In [[axiomatic set theory]], the existence of unordered pairs is required by an axiom, the [[axiom of pairing]].

More generally, an '''unordered '''''n'''''-tuple''' is a set of the form {''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...&amp;nbsp;''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}.&lt;ref&gt;

The values that a person holds may be personal or political depending on whether they are considered in relation to the individual or to society.&lt;ref&gt;Mason E. ''Value Pluralism'', 2006 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2018); ''cf''. Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, pp.7ff&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from moral virtue, examples of personal values include friendship, knowledge, beauty etc. and examples of political values, justice, equality and liberty. This article will outline some current ideas relating to the first group - personal values. It will begin by looking at the kinds of thing that have value and finish with a look at some of the theories that attempt to describe what value is.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman M.J. ''Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Value'', 2002 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;  Reference will be made solely to Western sources although it is recognised that many, if not all, of the values discussed may be universal.

==Introduction==

It is only in the last hundred years or so that the subject of value has become a subject of study in its own right. A new field of enquiry called “[[axiology]]” (from the Greek ''axios'' meaning “worth”), defined as “the philosophical study of goodness or value”, began to emerge at around the beginning of the twentieth century, and its significance lay in extending the scope of the term “value” into fields other than traditional [[Value (ethics)|ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Ex.Brit. s.v. ''Axiology''&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hermann Lotze|R.H.Lotze]], [[Franz Brentano|F.Brentano]] and [[G. E. Moore|G.E.Moore]] have been cited as early proponents of the subject, and to Moore is attributed the important distinction made between [[Instrumental and intrinsic value|intrinsic and instrumental value]], that is, between things that have value in themselves and things that might lead to something of value.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''; cf. Schroeder ''Op.cit''.5&lt;/ref&gt; 

Examples of recent articles which introduce the subject include Mark Schroeder’s ''Value Theory'',&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder M. ''Value Theory'', 2008 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;  Elinor Mason’s ''Value Pluralism''&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1&lt;/ref&gt;  and Michael Zimmerman’s ''Intrinsic and Extrinsic Value''.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2&lt;/ref&gt; Schroeder defines axiology as being “primarily concerned with classifying what things are good”, and, in accepting that there might be a number of things that can be valued or called good, he asks is there, underlying these, just one or is there more than one fundamental intrinsic value. Mason outlines two ways in which values have been considered in relation to one another: the first is called “[[Monism|monist]]”, which maintains that there is just one intrinsic value to which all other values are auxiliary; and the second is called “[[Value pluralism|pluralist]]”, which maintains that there are many kinds of value and that the most important of these are irreducible to one another. Typical of the first school were the [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarians]], such as [[Jeremy Bentham]], who thought that all the values that a person might hold could be reduced to a desire for happiness or pleasure. [[Immanuel Kant]], too, has been described as a monist in saying that the only good in itself lies in possessing a good will.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''; cf. Kant.I ''Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysics of Morals'', 1785, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding those holding pluralist views, Zimmerman in his book ''The Nature of Intrinsic Value'' (2012) gives some examples of more recent philosophers with lists of the kinds of thing that they thought had value:&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman M.J. ''The Nature of Intrinsic Value'' (Rowman and Littlefield, Lanham, 2001) p.189&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] (1889): Pleasure, Happiness, Love, Knowledge, Beauty, Proportion, Intention, Exercise, Virtue&lt;ref&gt;Brentano F. ''The Origin of our Knowledge of Right and Wrong'', 1889 (Routledge and Keegan Paul, London, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[G. E. Moore|Moore]] (1908) - Aesthetics, Affection, Knowledge, Consciousness, Pleasure, Virtue&lt;ref&gt;Moore G.E. ''Principia Ethica'' (Cambridge University Press, 1903) pp.122 &amp; ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. D. Ross|Ross]] (1936) - Virtue, Pleasure, Knowledge, Artistic activity&lt;ref&gt;Ross W.D. ''The Right and the Good'' (Oxford University Press, 1930)&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, Zimmerman singles out the work of [[William Frankena]] who, in his book ''Ethics'' (1963), gave a comprehensive list of values and who, besides suggesting the use of headings, began to group similar values together.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena W.K. ''Ethics'', 1963 (Prentice-Hall, Eaglewood Cliffs, 1973) pp.87-88; cf. Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2&lt;/ref&gt; It will be useful to discuss these in the following groups:

1. Beauty, harmony, proportion, aesthetic experience

2. Moral disposition, virtue, pleasure, happiness, contentment

3. Truth, knowledge, understanding, wisdom, honour, esteem

4. Life, health, strength, peace, security

5. Love, affection, friendship, cooperation

6. Power, achievement, freedom, adventure, novelty

Frankena, in formulating his list, builds on what he called the “classical triad” of [[Transcendentals|beauty, goodness and truth]]&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''; cf. O’Hear A. ''Philosophy: The Good, the True and the Beautiful'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010) ''cf''. Perry ''Op.cit''.49, pp.93-97, 693&lt;/ref&gt; and headings similar to these terms can be used to introduce a primary set of values as follows.

==Primary Values==

===Aesthetic values===

[[William Frankena|Frankena]] in his list of values groups beauty with harmony, proportion and aesthetic experience. There are many different kinds of value that can be included in this category and Frankena himself distinguishes between “harmony and proportion in objects contemplated” and “harmony and proportion in one’s own life”.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit.13'', p.88&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to [[Plato]] who, firstly, in the ''[[Philebus]]'' suggests that aesthetic pleasure lies in the “beauty of colour and form”, and secondly in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' that formal features like harmony and proportion are important not only to art and music but also to the “good life” which itself should contain “form”, “variety” and “balance”.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit.13'', p.92; cf. Plato ''The Republic'' (ed. Ferrari G., tr. Griffith T., Cambridge University Press, 2000) pp.88-92; cf Plato ''Philebus'' 51&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another distinction results from the question of whether aesthetic value resides in the object contemplated or in the contemplative experience itself.&lt;ref&gt;Beardsley M.C. ''Aesthetics from Classical Greece to the Present'', 1966 (University of Alabama Press, 1975) pp.101-102 &amp; ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; James Shelley in his article ''The Concept of the Aesthetic'' notes that the term "aesthetic" in deriving from the Greek ''aesthesis'', which means perception or awareness, tends towards the latter interpretation;&lt;ref&gt;Shelley J. ''The Concept of the Aesthetic'', 2009 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] in his book ''Art and the Aesthetic'' charts the development of awareness and consciousness in their growing importance to aesthetic theory;&lt;ref&gt;Dickie G. ''Art and the Aesthetic: An Intuitional Analysis'' (Cornell University Press, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; and Zimmerman refers to [[G. E. Moore|G.E.Moore]] who wrote in relation to art and beauty that “by far the most valuable thing we know or can imagine are certain states of consciousness”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2; cf. Moore''Op.cit''.11, p.122&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[William Frankena|Frankena]] and [[Nicolai Hartmann]], who Frankena mentions, begin their lists of values with groups including consciousness, life and existence, and Hartmann makes reference to [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] who considered that the value of beauty in art or nature lay in an increased awareness of life as an “affirmation of existence”.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann N. ''Ethics'': Part II, ''The Realm of Ethical Values'' or ''Axiology of Morals'', 1926 (George Allen and Unwin, London, 1951) Chs. 11&amp;12; cf. Nietzsche F. ''The Birth of Tragedy'' pp.263,290&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelley describes another concept apart from “immediacy” or “focussing one’s attention on the subject” and this is the concept of “disinterestedness", a Kantian term which consists in looking at things objectively and impartially.&lt;ref&gt;Kant I. ''The Critique of Judgement'' (tr. Meredith J.C. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1952)&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] who realised that if perception were to be the only criterion of aesthetic value then, with a mind stripped of practical interest and cultural preconceptions, anything at all might be seen as beautiful: “One thing is only taken as more beautiful than another because it makes this pure contemplation easier”, wrote Schopenhauer,&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer A. ''The World as Will and Representation'' (tr. Payne E. Dover Publications, New York, 1966) pp.271-272&lt;/ref&gt; a view criticised by Sartwell for making the term beauty, ultimately meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Sartwell C. ''Beauty'', 2012 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley, however, manages to elucidate various criteria of aesthetic value from such a standpoint: firstly, that there is value in simple formal relations, in harmony, grace and balance, and in fact in any other objective aspect that a good critic might care to point to; secondly, that there is value in recognising that people have natural tastes and preferences, whether, for example, they prefer “drama or comicality”, or whether the work is striking in some way; and thirdly, that there is value in recognising the presence of “non-exhibited properties”, realising that the work, or perception, is located within an “art-historical context” where only knowledge of, in [[Arthur Danto|Danto’s]] terminology, an “artworld” can facilitate our feeling “the proper sentiments”.&lt;ref&gt;Shelley ''Op.cit''.18; cf. Dickie ''Op.cit.''19&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the views that aesthetic value lies either in the object or in the subjective experience there is a third view which suggests that value lies in some kind of engagement between the two. [[G. E. Moore|G.E.Moore]]  wrote that it is neither in the “beautiful object” nor in the “conscious perception” where value is found but in the relationship between the two.&lt;ref&gt;Moore ''Op.cit''.11 pp.18,59,122&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley too concludes with the idea that there is some reciprocal relationship between subject and object, his example being that of a Bartok quartet, where “a value originally belonging to the quartet has been transferred to the experience, before being reflected back, once again, onto the quartet.”&lt;ref&gt;Shelley ''Op.cit''.18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical values===

The second group of values listed by Frankena includes happiness, virtue, pleasure, satisfaction and contentment - values traditionally associated with the field of [[Value (ethics)|ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13&lt;/ref&gt;  Zimmerman introduces Plato whose recurring concern was with the nature of the good, how we should live our lives, and whether it is [[pleasure]] or [[virtue]] that will lead to [[happiness]].&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.9, p.114; cf. Plato ''Op.cit''.16, pp.37,51&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding pleasure, he considers food, drink and shelter to be simple [[goods]] – people value them, they value the work that goes into providing them and the pleasure that comes from enjoying them. Zimmerman after asking why eating should be considered a value refers to [[Aristotle]] who said that value resides in “the proper activity or functioning of things according to their nature” and that it is the “active exercising of man’s faculties that give rise to pleasure”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2; cf. Aristotle ''Nicomachean Ethics'' (tr. Thomson J., Penguin, Harmondsworth, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Regarding [[virtue]], Elinor Mason refers to [[John Stuart Mill|J.S.Mill]] who made the distinction between lower values and higher values.&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1&lt;/ref&gt;  The distinction is that between efficient cause and final cause: whereas efficient cause includes hunger, thirst and the need for shelter, final cause arises from our having an overview of the relation of [[Causality|cause and effect]] whereby we can determine the end we want to achieve and then decide the means to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.86; cf. Aristotle ''Metaphysics'' 982b-983a&lt;/ref&gt;  If the end is well-being or happiness then such values as friendship, knowledge and beauty, as well as material sustenance, might be instrumental in achieving this.&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1&lt;/ref&gt;  Mason refers to [[G. E. Moore|G.E.Moore]] who, whilst recognising the virtues of “industry and temperance”, recognised that there exists a “plurality of bearers of value”. [[Love]], [[beauty]] and [[friendship]] are intrinsic values (i.e. good in themselves) rather than instrumental values, and they do not lead in all cases necessarily either to [[pleasure]] or [[happiness]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore ''Op.cit.''11&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another significant writer on value, mentioned by both [[William Frankena|Frankena]] and Zimmerman, is [[John Dewey]] who questioned whether intrinsic values exist at all. All values for Dewey were instrumental. He compared life to an “ongoing stream” of cause and effect, which he called the “continuum of means and ends”,&lt;ref&gt;Dewey J. ''Theory of Valuation'', 1923, in ''International Encyclopaedia of Unified Sciences'' Vol II (University of Chicago Press, 1939) p.43; cf. Anderson ''Op.cit''.140&lt;/ref&gt;  where for example a lack of food leads to human activity leading to a further expenditure of energy, the need for more food and so on. He maintained, like [[Aristotle]], that value lay in economy and in the efficient functioning of a human being in terms of a whole range of needs and wants.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. pp.15-18, 50&lt;/ref&gt;  These needs arise from a constant “interaction between a human being and his environment” and Dewey introduced the notion of having a “framework” of values to deal effectively with the various categories of being which contribute to our environment.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural values===

The third of the classical values - [[truth]] – is listed by [[William Frankena|Frankena]] alongside [[knowledge]], understanding and [[wisdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;  Given that “truth may never be fully known” he shifted the emphasis onto knowledge, and most lists of values now tend to include knowledge rather than truth as one of the primary values. [[Jesse Prinz]] in ''[[Culture]] and [[Cognitive Science]]'' took this further discussing the relativity of the terms knowledge and truth and the role that culture has in shaping knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Prinz J. ''Culture and Cognitive Science'', 2011 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;  This relativity is more pronounced in a second group listed by Frankena, a group which included the values of [[honour]], esteem and good reputation. The link between the two groups was noted by [[Nicolai Hartmann|Hartmann]] who realised that the terms “truth” and “truthfulness” involved two different, although related, kinds of value.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.17, Sec.6&lt;/ref&gt;  Whilst [[truth]] is associated with the values of [[knowledge]] and understanding, truthfulness is associated with the values of honesty, uprightness and [[integrity]].

In his article, [[Jesse Prinz|Prinz]] defines [[culture]] as a complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morality and custom where the value associated with these things is acquired by people as members of society. This acquisition takes place through observing role models, imitating one’s parents or learning through association with others. The telling of stories is mentioned&lt;ref&gt;Prinz ''Op.cit''.39&lt;/ref&gt;  and we may think of the value of books, whether fiction or non-fiction, and the worth of films or news programmes in disseminating knowledge and furthering understanding generally. Memory too has its place,&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''; ''cf''. Ruskin J. ''The Seven Lamps of Architecture'' (George Allen, London, 1880) pp.177ff&lt;/ref&gt;  and the importance of history in this respect is highlighted by Zimmerman who notes that some things may have value, not because they are beautiful or useful, but because they have meaning through either personal or cultural associations, for example a rare stamp or the pen with which Lincoln signed his letters.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2&lt;/ref&gt; 

Knowledge of both [[culture]] and [[subculture]] is important in understanding people’s values.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey ''Op.cit''.35, pp.58-64&lt;/ref&gt;  Jacobson in an article on fitting [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] tells us that what people find funny or shameful, honourable or dishonourable are culturally related, and he refers back to [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] who introduced the related value of what is appropriate, suitable or fitting.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson D. ''Fitting Attitude Theories of Value'', 2011 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  Such values, however, can be considered not only from the point of view of a particular culture but from “the point of view of the universe” where integrating one’s set of values with the principles of some higher truth (“selective copying” is the example he gives) may result in instances of non-conformity and other kinds of differentiation within society.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of “fittingness” introduces the value of [[integrity]] which Cox, La Caze and Levine discuss in their article ''Integrity'' [2001].&lt;ref&gt;Cox D., La Caze M. &amp; Levine M. ''Integrity'', 2001 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept is defined in terms of the relation between the different aspects of one’s life – aesthetic, social, intellectual etc. – and in maintaining some sort of balance between them to give a sense of unity or wholeness. Views on integrity range from the practical requirements of honesty and truthfulness on the one hand, where [[Aristotle]] could write “with a true view all the data harmonise and with a false view the facts soon clash”,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Op.cit''.30, 1098b&lt;/ref&gt;  to more general approaches regarding meaning and [[Personal identity|identity]], or “wisdom and [[Self-concept|self-knowledge]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, La Caze &amp; Levine ''Op.cit''.47&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Secondary Values==

The end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries saw an expansion in the number of values over and above the “classical” or primary values of beauty, goodness and truth. Some, like love, friendship and affection, clearly come from the Christian tradition and were discussed by philosophers like [[G. E. Moore|Moore]] and [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit.'' 13, pp.56-59; ''cf''. Moore ''Op.cit''.11 pp.131-132&lt;/ref&gt;  A more complex group revolving around concepts such as power, spirit and the will were introduced as values by Brentano and [[Nicolai Hartmann|Hartmann]] and owe as much to the thoughts of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] as they do to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm R. ''Brentano and Intrinsic Value'' (Cambridge University Press, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;  The emergence of a third group of values can be seen as a result of the expansion of the field away from traditional ethics, and in this group there begin to appear more material values – what [[Plato]] called the “goods of the body” – such as life, health and strength in the lists of Hartmann and Frankena.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.17; cf. Plato ''Op.cit''.16 591b; cf Plato ''Meno'' 90ff&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some early attempts were made at compiling a longer set of values and three of these can be mentioned here. [[Ralph Barton Perry|R.B.Perry]], referred to by Frankena, and whose work ''The General Theory of Value'' [1926] was called “the magnum opus of the new approach” by the Encyclopaedia Britannica, increased the total number of categories by adding to the fields of aesthetics, ethics and knowledge the three further fields of religion, economics and politics;&lt;ref&gt;Perry R.B. ''General Theory of Value'' (Harvard University Press; 1926) pp.693-694&lt;/ref&gt;  An earlier work, ''Lebensformen'' [1914], by the psychologist, [[Eduard Spranger]], set out a similar list describing six types of personality, namely the Aesthetic, Economic, Theoretic, Religious, Social and Political;&lt;ref&gt;Spranger E. ''Types of Men'', 1914 (tr. Pigors P., Max Niemeyer Verlag, Halle, 1928)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gordon Allport]], who studied under Spranger, and who was mentioned in [[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Peterson]] and [[Martin Seligman|Seligman’s]] ''[[Character Strengths and Virtues]]'' [2004]&lt;ref&gt;Miller C.B. ''Empirical Approaches to Moral Character'', 2016 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2016); ''cf''. Peterson C. &amp; Seligman M. ''Character Strengths and Virtues'' (Oxford University Press, New York, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; , together with Vernon and Lindzey, set out in their ''Study of Values'' [1950] six types of personality each of which was orientated towards a different set of values:&lt;ref&gt;Allport G., Vernon P.E. &amp; Lindzey G.E. ''Study of Values'' (Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

These early links between philosophy and psychology have been discussed recently by C.B.Miller in his article entitled ''Empirical Approaches to Moral Character'' and this concluded with a look at the work of Peterson and Seligman.&lt;ref&gt;Miller ''Op.cit''.55&lt;/ref&gt;  Their classification of values, "[[Values in Action Inventory of Strengths|Values in Action]]" or VIA, arose from an empirical survey of virtues taken from around the world, which led to a six-fold classification, similar to the above, and comprising: Transcendence, Temperance, Wisdom, Justice, Humanity and Courage.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson and Seligman ''Op.cit'' 55&lt;/ref&gt;  Miller suggested, however, that no valid reason has been discovered as to why there should be six categories.

Regarding the content of these additional categories it is clear that their representative values differ according to who is compiling the list. One theory suggests that if the first three categories represent the cognitive or classical tradition, then the additional categories represent the non-cognitive - the “sentimental” or “emotivist” tradition - where neither the cognitive nor the non-cognitive necessarily takes primacy.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit.'' 2; Jacobson ''Op.cit''. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  Zimmerman suggested that values taken from the latter viewpoint could be seen as just expressions of feeling or emotion about what is important.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;  A.M.Taylor in her paper, ''Investigation into Facts and Values'' [1983], suggested that there was a fundamental difference between values based on analytical understanding and values based on synthetic or “wholistic” understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor A-M (née Cushan) ''Investigation into Facts and Values'', 1983 (Ondwell Publications, Victoria, Australia, 2014) pp.9, 14-16&lt;/ref&gt;  The older values taken from the “aesthetic, moral and scientific spheres” were not enough and new categories would be required to include such concepts as “creativity, feeling and innovation”. Jacobson also introduced a distinction between cognitive and non-cognitive values, and among the values derived from feeling or sentiment he included those of being “pride-worthy, shameful, funny and fearsome”.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson ''Op.cit''.45&lt;/ref&gt;  He mentioned [[David Hume]] in this respect who had used the three headings of “Pride and Humility”, “Love and Hatred” and “Will and the Direct Passions” in the second volume of his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature|Treatise of Human Nature]]''&lt;ref&gt;Hume D. A ''Treatise of Human Nature'' (ed. Selby-Bigge L.A., Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;  and it will be useful to look at the second group of values in this order.

===Material Values===

[[William Frankena|Frankena’s]] list of values begins with a group that contains life, health and strength and in this he closely follows [[Nicolai Hartmann|Hartmann]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;  “Material goods” were discussed by Hartmann in the introductory section of his book,''The Realm of Ethical Values'' [1926] in relation to wealth and economics.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.21&lt;/ref&gt;  Frankena mentions [[Plato]] who had referred to wealth, health and strength as “goods of the body”.&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Op.cit''.16&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding wealth, Frankena, in a discussion of “money, cars and other material possessions”, suggested that its value might be either instrumental or contributory, the latter term being defined in terms of “things that are good because they contribute to a good life or are parts of it”.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, pp.62,81&lt;/ref&gt;  Money for a miser becomes part of his happiness, just as clothes, house or land may be a part of happiness for somebody else. Jacobson introduced the value of being “pride-worthy” and he mentioned [[David Hume]] who had noted that people take pride in, such “external advantages as… country, family, children, gardens, houses, dogs and clothes”.&lt;ref&gt;Hume ''Op.cit''.63, p.545&lt;/ref&gt;  Elinor Mason mentioned the practical wisdom of [[Aristotle]] who saw wealth as a matter of prudence, and who advised people to value and “not to neglect” what belongs to them.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Op.cit''.30, 1120b&lt;/ref&gt; 

Health on the other hand, in relation to the body and the mind, is usually thought of as an intrinsic value. [[William Frankena|Frankena]], for example, wrote that we desire health “for its own sake”,&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, pp.82,87&lt;/ref&gt;  and Zimmerman wrote that “Being healthy is just a good way to be”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2&lt;/ref&gt;  The value that we ascribe to life itself and the value of “just being” have been mentioned previously, but it was Hartmann who reintroduced the notion from earlier German philosophy that Being has a complementary category, namely that of [[Becoming (philosophy)|Becoming]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.21; cf. Schopenhauer ''Op.cit''.23&lt;/ref&gt;  Everything is subject to change over time, and without human intervention, is subject to deterioration and decay. In relation to this, Mason referred to [[Immanuel Kant]] one of whose principal values lay in [[duty]], particularly, in this respect, duty to self, and looking after the “basic stuff” through physical exercise and maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;Kant I ''The Metaphysics of Morals'', 1797 (tr. Gregor M., Cambridge University Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Plato had also thought that the right way of living lay in “medicine, bathing and exercise”&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Op.cit''.16&lt;/ref&gt;  but Kant added to this idea by saying that value also lay in self-improvement through the cultivation of any “natural talents and gifts of fortune” that a person might possess.&lt;ref&gt;Kant ''Op.cit''.73&lt;/ref&gt;  [[James Griffin (philosopher)|James Griffin]] in his book on ''[[Well-being|Well-Being]]'' [1986] similarly introduced the value of “accomplishment” and how, in Aristotle’s terminology, we might grow and “[[Flourishing|flourish]]” in other ways.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin J. ''Well-Being: Its Meaning, Measurement and Moral Importance'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1986) pp.35,57&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Communal Values===

To the classical triad of beauty, goodness and truth various philosophers in the twentieth century began to add values from another large family: that of, in [[William Frankena|Frankena's]] words, “[[love]], [[friendship]], mutual affection and cooperation”;&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, pp.42,88&lt;/ref&gt; [[G. E. Moore|G.E.Moore]] added “love” to the values of beauty, moral quality and knowledge;&lt;ref&gt;Moore ''Op.cit''.11, pp.122-123; cf. Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.9, p.189&lt;/ref&gt; and Jacobson added “friendship” to the values of beauty, pleasure and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson ''Op.cit''.45 “Consider a plausible list of intrinsic values: pleasure, beauty, friendship, knowledge…”&lt;/ref&gt;  Moore, in reflecting Christianity’s emphasis on the importance of [[Agape|love]], suggested that “… the love of love is by far the most valuable good we know… more complicated than beauty… more complicated than knowledge”.&lt;ref&gt;Moore ''Op.cit''.11, p.132&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Frankena and Zimmerman mentioned [[Plato]], who had outlined various kinds of [[love]] in the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Symposium'' 197&lt;/ref&gt;  and who had described ''sympatheia'' or coaffection , as “filling men with affection… kindness… friendship… forgiveness”.&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Op.cit''.16, 605d&lt;/ref&gt;  For Plato, the soul was the seat of love and the affections, and its value lay in recognising the “community of feeling among mankind”.&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Timaeus'' 192b; Plato ''Gorgias'' 481&lt;/ref&gt;  Jacobson referred to [[David Hume]] who similarly linked love with [[sympathy]], the  latter feeling arising from “the great resemblance among human creatures”.&lt;ref&gt;Hume ''Op.cit.''63, p.112&lt;/ref&gt; 

On a more practical level, [[Bernard Gert]] in his work on ''The Definition of Morality'' [2002] introduced the notion of “[[loyalty]]” as a factor in establishing a sense of [[community]] among family and kinship groups.&lt;ref&gt;Gert B. &amp; Gert J. ''The Definition of Morality'', 2002 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding wider society, Gert mentioned [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] who distinguished between the values of not harming other people on the one hand and performing positive, charitable acts on the other.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Zimmerman also mentioned Kant and his view that the only thing that is good without qualification is goodwill or benevolence.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2&lt;/ref&gt;  Kant had defined [[friendship]] as “the coming together of two persons through mutual love, each particating and sharing their lives in a sympathetic manner”.&lt;ref&gt;Kant ''Op.cit''.73, 6.450, 6.469&lt;/ref&gt;  He also introduced the concept of “[[respect]]” by which he meant keeping an appropriate distance from others within the community,&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''. 6.449&lt;/ref&gt;  and he talked of [[community]] itself in terms of “being able to communicate… to perfect social intercourse… and to cultivate a disposition of… reciprocity… agreeableness… courtesy… hospitality”.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.6.473&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Communication]] was introduced as a separate value by [[Ralph Barton Perry|Perry]];&lt;ref&gt;Perry ''Op.cit''.53, pp.13-14&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Nicolai Hartmann|Hartmann]], after working through the primary values, introduced a “second group” which included not only “brotherly love” but also “social intercourse”.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.21&lt;/ref&gt;  Frankena introduced [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] who had stressed the value of communication in human relationships saying that “there are close parallels between the communication of words and that between lover and beloved”.&lt;ref&gt;Gilby T. ''St Thomas Aquinas: Theological Texts'' (Oxford University Press) pp.181ff&lt;/ref&gt;  Gert too realised that there was value in “interpersonal interaction” but queried how such a value could apply in the absence of other people, for example, on a desert island.&lt;ref&gt;Gert &amp; Gert ''Op.cit''.85&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Frankena|Frankena]] answered the question by widening the scope of love to include love of, or communion with, God, animals, nature and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13 p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual Values===

Towards the end of his list, [[William Frankena|Frankena]] included the values of power and achievement, freedom, adventure and novelty.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding freedom, he introduced [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] who saw life as a continuous engagement with the realm of strife, a struggle against desire and the “[[Will (philosophy)|primal will]]”, where the only moments of freedom that a person may have lay in art, music and [[Spirituality|spiritual contemplation]].&lt;ref&gt;Beardsley ''Op.cit''.17, p.459; cf. Carrit E.F. ''The Theory of Beauty'' (Methuen &amp; Co, London, 1914) p.122&lt;/ref&gt;  Strength and freedom of the [[Will (philosophy)|will]] were values for Hartmann too,&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.21, Sec.3&lt;/ref&gt;  and also for [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] who, as Zimmerman noted, saw such freedom lying in the absence of coercion either from external agencies of from internal “sensuous impulses”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2; cf.Kant I. ''Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysics of Morals'', 1785, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;  These latter included [[Emotion|emotions]] such as [[desire]], [[fear]], [[hope]] and [[anger]], whose value, or power, lay, according to Aristotle, in moving a person either towards or away from some perceived object.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''De Anima'' 408b; Similar feelings inform our attitudes, according to Brentano, which he termed either pro-attitudes or anti-attitudes accordingly, see Chisholm ''Op.cit.''51, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;  Griffin distinguished between desire itself and “informed desire”, where the value of the latter lay in stirring the mind, not involuntarily through emotion and natural inclination, but through the voluntary power of the will.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin ''Op.cit''.76; pp.26-27&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Attitude (psychology)|Attitudes]] can be controlled through strength of mind, courage and self-discipline, and “corrected”, according to [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]], through an informed choice about what is right, fitting or appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson ''Op.cit''.45&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[William Frankena|Frankena]] recorded that his list included “all the things that [[Nicolai Hartmann|Hartmann]] mentions”,&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;  but it is notable that Hartmann completed his list with what he called “spiritual goods” such as “love of the remote” and, in a [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschian]] phrase, “radiant virtue”.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.21, Sec.7&lt;/ref&gt;  Love of the remote referred to either love of the wilderness or love of God, but Michael Stocker in ''Plural and Conflicting Values'' [1990]&lt;ref&gt;Stocker M. ''Plural and Conflicting Values'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;  suggested that value lay more, as Plato had said, not in love but in the “[[contemplation]]” of God or of what is good: “He who proceeds aright”, said Plato, “should begin in youth to visit beautiful places… to contemplate the vast sea… until on that shore he grows and waxes strong”.&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Symposium'' 210&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Jewish tradition it was not so much the sea that bestowed strength, but the hills,&lt;ref&gt;Psalms 121.1&lt;/ref&gt;  and Griffin referred to those who value mountains for the excitement or the [[sublimity]] that they might afford.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin ''Op.cit''.76, p.27&lt;/ref&gt;   Frankena referred to the values of adventure and novelty that [[Alfred North Whitehead|A.N.Whitehead]] had introduced,&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.92&lt;/ref&gt;  but it was [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] in the previous century who had written about the inspirational value of new things and of travel, not only for the sake of art or study, but for the value of the experience itself.&lt;ref&gt;Emerson R.W. ''Experience'' in ''Nature and Selected Essays'' (Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nicolai Hartmann|Hartmann]] suggested that it might be a great work of art such as a cathedral or a piece of music that might be inspiring,&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann ''Op.cit''.21, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;  and he mentioned [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] who wrote regarding art: “What does all art do? Does it not select? Does it not highlight? By doing these art strengthens certain values… It is the great stimulus of life”.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche F. ''Twilight of the Idols'' (tr. Hollingdale R., Penguin, Harmondsworth, 1968) pp.81-82&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively it might be [[humour]] that lifts the spirits and Jacobson discusses the value that different kinds of humour, such as being funny or being amusing might merit.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson ''Op.cit.''45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of Value==

Various theories have been put forward in the West to try and define what a value “is” – as opposed to saying what kinds of value a thing may “have”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2&lt;/ref&gt;  There are generally held to be three kinds of theory at present that attempt to answer the question of what a value is and these have been borrowed from the field of [[Normative ethics|ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1; cf. Frankena ''Op.cit.''13, pp.14,62; cf. Schroeder ''Op.cit''.5&lt;/ref&gt;  Each group of theories tends to concentrate on different aspects of the subject so that if ethics can be defined as, say,  the principles governing the conduct of a person&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.6; cf. Gert &amp; Gert ''Op.cit''.85&lt;/ref&gt;  then the first group of theories ([[ontology]] and [[Deontological ethics|deontology]]) looks at the principles themselves, the second group of theories ([[teleology]] and [[consequentialism]]) looks at the aims and outcomes of conduct, and the third group of theories ([[virtue ethics]] and fitting-attitude theory) looks at the concept of the person, their character and attitudes.

===Ontology and Deontology===

[[Ontology]] (from the Greek ''Ontos'' meaning “being” or “that which is”)&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', 1940, pr.p. of ''ennai'' “to be”&lt;/ref&gt;  is that branch of metaphysics which deals with being, and, particularly in relation to value theory, with the “ontological categories” or plain [[Category of being|categories of being]].&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.9, p.52; cf. Moore Op.cit.11, pp.77ff&lt;/ref&gt;  Zimmerman mentions [[G. E. Moore|G.E.Moore]] who pointed out that before discussing what we ought to value we should consider the possibility that anything that exists might be of value to somebody: “If we recognise that anything whatever may be good… we start with a much more open mind”.&lt;ref&gt;Moore ''Op.cit''.11, pp.13,74; ''cf''. Perry ''Op.cit''.53, pp.115-116&lt;/ref&gt;  Zimmerman introduced the concept of “[[supervenience]]” through which it is held that any structuring of our values will reflect the structuring of the underlying [[Category of being|categories of being]] themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2; ''cf''. Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.9, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] is mentioned by Zimmerman in this respect, and also [[Christine Korsgaard]] who, drawing on Kant’s distinction between [[Thing-in-itself|things-in-themselves]] and the [[Relation (history of concept)|relation between things]], draws a similar distinction between [[Instrumental and intrinsic value|intrinsic values]] (values in virtue of “non-relational properties”) and extrinsic values (values in virtue of “relational properties”).&lt;ref&gt;Ibid; cf. Korsgaard C. ''Two Distinctions in Goodness'' (in ''Philosophical Review'', 92, 169-95, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding the former an impasse is reached when all that can be said of intrinsic values is, in Moore’s words, that goodness “just is”, or in Zimmerman’s words that pleasure “just is”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2; cf Moore ''Op.cit''.11, pp.6ff&lt;/ref&gt;  This has led to some, like [[Monroe Beardsley]], to say that only extrinsic values, in the final analysis, exist.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Different kinds of extrinsic value in this model derive from the different underlying categories of relation, the example given being those of beauty, utility and meaning, each of which is supervenient on one of Kant’s three [[Category (Kant)|categories of relation]], namely disjunction, causality and inherence respectively.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''; cf. ''Kant I. Critique of Pure Reason''  (tr. Smith N.K. Macmillan, London, 1968) pp.107,113&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Deontological ethics|Deontology]], on the other hand, (from the Greek ''Deon'' meaning “duty”)&lt;ref&gt;Liddell &amp; Scott ''Op.cit''.118&lt;/ref&gt;  is the branch of [[Value (ethics)|ethics]] that bases value on moral principles which in turn form a guide to knowing what "ought" to be done in various situations. The problem in philosophy of moving from an “is” to an “ought” (the “[[Is-ought problem]]") is said to have been introduced into philosophy by [[David Hume]]. Richmond Campbell, in discussing this, asks how one might move from a knowledge of what exists, i.e. from a whole range of possible values, to a knowledge of which, among these, one ought to value.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell R. ''Moral Epistemology'', 2003 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;  Given that “a small number of core moral values are espoused universally” the answer would appear to lie in giving priority to those which do not “conflict”. [[William Frankena|Frankena]] suggested that these moral principles are derived from three main sources: the prevailing moral rules of a culture; divine revelation as found in the holy texts; and logical or metaphysical deduction.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, pp.12ff&lt;/ref&gt;  Kant’s [[categorical imperative]] is given as an example of the latter, although Frankena pointed out that a distinction would need to be made between arguments of [[Necessity and sufficiency|logical necessity]], i.e. those which contain no contradictions, and arguments of [[Necessity and sufficiency|logical sufficiency]] which would be needed to account for the various kinds of value, whether “aesthetic, prudential or logical”.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., pp.30-33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teleology and Consequentialism===

Mark Schroeder in his article on ''Value Theory'' considers [[consequentialism]] to be “under the umbrella” of [[teleology]],&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder ''Op.cit''.5&lt;/ref&gt;  where the latter can be defined as that branch of [[metaphysics]] which deals with the final end or purpose of things (the Greek ''Telos'' meaning “the end or purpose of an action”).&lt;ref&gt;Liddell &amp; Scott ''Op.cit''.118&lt;/ref&gt;  According to this group of theories things are instrumentally valuable which help to achieve either specific or general ends, and underlying this, Schroeder tells us, is the relation of [[Causality|cause and effect]].&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder ''Op.cit''.5&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Frankena|Frankena]] defined [[Instrumental and intrinsic value|instrumental value]] as that which is good or useful for some purpose and he referred to [[Aristotle]] who, besides defining different [[Four causes|kinds of cause]], defined the good as “that at which all things aim”.&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.86; ''cf''. Aristotle ''Op.cit''.30&lt;/ref&gt;  If for example the aim is to live a good life those things will be good or valuable which constitute the means for achieving such an end. However, what is good for a specific person and what is good for the world as a whole are two different things and are reflected, according to Schroeder, in the ideas of [[egoism]] and [[consequentialism]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder ''Op.cit''.5&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding the latter, Zimmerman writes that a value is good because of a perceived final end in which “all the consequences taken as a whole are good”.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2&lt;/ref&gt; 

Regarding the end at which people aim, [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]], according to Elinor Mason, thought that the sole end was that of  “[[pleasure]]”, and that all other values such as [[beauty]], [[friendship]], [[knowledge]] etc could be measured in accordance with the quantity of pleasure which each might afford.&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Stuart Mill]] suggested that there were lower and higher pleasures and that these were fundamentally incommensurable. He went on to question, like [[Plato]], whether the values of pleasure or satisfaction were in fact the ends at which intelligent people should aim.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''; cf. Plato ''Op.cit''.16, p.505b&lt;/ref&gt;  Mason also refers to [[James Griffin (philosopher)|James Griffin]] who was of the opinion that “[[well-being]]” was a better name for such an end, and which he saw in terms of “[[flourishing]]” or a “maximisation of life” in all its aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin ''Op.cit''.76, pp.34,57&lt;/ref&gt;  A “balancing of elements” is required whereby those activities which we value for well-being, such as work, rest, love, solitude, health, accomplishment etc. should be considered “in various combinations” in order to afford a “framework” or a “plan of life” for ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., p.58; cf. Dewey ''Op.cit''.35, p.47 re “framework”&lt;/ref&gt;  This way of thinking was called by [[Elizabeth S. Anderson|Elizabeth Anderson]], in her article on [[John Dewey]], “objective list theory” as opposed to theories like Bentham’s based on pleasure or those of  Dewey based on “informed desire”.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson E. ''Dewey’s Moral Philosophy'', 2005 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  Dewey rejected the notion of a final end arguing instead that the “value of means and ends are reciprocally determined”.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey ''Op.cit''.35, pp.24,40ff&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Zimmerman, he challenged traditional metaphysical ideas with a more “pragmatic” approach saying that only through “calm, informed reflection” on the ways in which people “interact with the environment” and deal with the ensuing consequences can value be ascertained.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit''.2; cf. Dewey ''Op.cit''.35, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;
  
===Virtue Ethics and Fitting-Attitude Theory===

Mason in her article on ''[[Value pluralism|Value Pluralism]]'' introduces [[virtue ethics]] as a third way of thinking about the subject of value and describes it as being based on how a person should “be” rather than what a person should “do”.&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Frankena|Frankena]] had similarly introduced an “ethics of [[virtue]]” as a third approach (following [[Deontological ethics|deontology]] and [[consequentialism]]), suggesting that there were two kinds of things that we can value: either the things around us like knowledge or physical objects; or the things inside us like our [[Trait theory|disposition]], [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and [[Emotion|emotions]].&lt;ref&gt;Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the latter were the virtues and these he defined as dispositions to act in certain ways.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., pp.64,68&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding the virtues, we can either value them in their own right or we can ask whether they tell us something about the nature of value itself. Hursthouse and Pettigrew deal with the first of these options in their article on ''[[Virtue Ethics]]'', asking questions like “how many virtues are there” and “how do they relate to each other”.&lt;ref&gt;Hursthouse R. &amp; Pettigrove G. ''Virtue Ethics'', 2003 (ed. Zalta E.N. ''Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'', 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;  C.B.Miller, on the other hand, in his article on [[Moral character|moral character]] points to recent work which suggests that the [[Category of being|categories]] used to structure the virtues are the same as those that can be used to structure values. The six “core virtues” listed by Peterson and Seligman have been found to be useful, for example, in the structuring of values in their “[[Values in Action Inventory of Strengths|Values in Action]]” or VAI.&lt;ref&gt;Miller ''Op.cit''.55&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the similarities between [[virtue theory]] and fitting-attitude theory is that they both approach the subject of value through an emphasis on the agent.&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1; cf. Frankena ''Op.cit''.13, p.64&lt;/ref&gt;  They are “agent-centred” rather than “act-centred” theories, but whereas virtues are defined purely as a disposition to act, fitting-attitude theory embraces the act as well within its field of consideration. [[Roderick Chisholm]] in his book, ''Brentano and Intrinsic Value'' [1986] suggested that value lies, for example, not just in [[virtue]] but in “individuals acting virtuously” or not just in [[pleasure]] but in “individuals experiencing pleasure”.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm ''Op.cit''.51, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;  However, just as there is conceived to be a necessary interaction between the agent and the environment so there is, in other circumstances, a necessary engagement between the agent and an object. Jacobson in his article on ''Fitting-Attitude Theory'' suggests that there is a reciprocity between “facts about human nature” and “facts about the object”,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson ''Op.cit''.45&lt;/ref&gt;  and that “to be valuable” requires either that one’s “feelings are adequate to the object”, or that “the object is “fitting” in respect of some particular attitude.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of fittingness, or what might fit together, is extended to the relation between different values and, in particular, the possible conflicts between them, the examples given being between that of [[humour]] and [[Taste (sociology)|good taste]], or between what is considered funny and what is considered fair or just. Both Mason&lt;ref&gt;Mason ''Op.cit''.1&lt;/ref&gt;  and Zimmerman&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman ''Op.cit.'' 2&lt;/ref&gt;  discuss the problem of [[Value pluralism|conflicting values]], as did [[Philippa Foot]] who, in the field of [[virtue ethics]], suggested that the answer to possible conflict lay in bringing the virtues, or values, into relation with one another saying “that even such concepts as love and justice can become dangerously distorted" if not tempered with a consideration of other fundamental values.&lt;ref&gt;Foot P. ''Virtues and Vices and Other Essays in Moral Philosophy'', 1978 (Clarendon press, Oxford, 2002) locs.125,225&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jain philosophy}}
'''Vitalism''' is at the core of [[Jain philosophy]] which separates ''[[Jiva]]'' (soul or life) from ''[[Ajiva]]'' (non-soul). According to Jain cosmology, whole universe is made up of six simple substances and is therefore eternal. These six substances ([[Dravya (Jainism)|dravya]]) are:-
*[[Jiva]]
*[[Time]]
*[[Space]]
*[[Dharma (Jainism)|Dharma]] (medium of motion)
*[[Adharma]]
*[[Matter]] ([[Pudgala]])

''Jiva'' or soul is distinguished from the rest five (termed ''[[Ajiva]]'') on account of the quality of intelligence with which it is endowed and of which the other substances are devoid.

== Overview ==
[[File:Jiva.jpg|thumb|Classification of ''Saṃsāri Jīvas'' (Transmigrating Souls) in Jainism.According to Sacred Jain text, ''[[Sarvārthasiddhi]]'': "Immobile beings (''sthāvara jīvās'') possess the four vitalities of the sense-organ of touch, strength of body or energy, respiration and life-duration.{{sfn|Jain|1960|p=62-63}}]]

According to [[Jainism]], there are ten [[vitalities]] or life-principles:-

*The five senses
**Touch
**Taste
**Smell
**Sight
**Hearing
*Energy,
*Respiration
*Life-duration
*The organ of speech
*The mind
The table below summarizes the vitalities that living beings possess in accordance with their senses.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=62–63,196}}

According to major [[Jain text]], [[Tattvarthsutra]]: "The severance of vitalities out of passion is injury".

Because life is to be considered sacred and in every living thing, Jains avoid killing any living creature. They are not only [[vegetarian]], but decline to eat vegetables that grow under the ground because each underground stem contains infinite number of vitalities each of that can potentially grow into full-fledged plants.
