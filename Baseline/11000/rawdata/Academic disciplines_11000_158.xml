      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5894">'''AES47''' is a standard which describes a method for transporting [[AES3]] professional digital audio streams over [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM) networks.

The [[Audio Engineering Society]] (AES) published AES47 in 2002. The method described by AES47 is also published by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] as '''IEC 62365'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec62365%7Bed2.0%7Den.pdf IEC 62365 preview]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Many professional audio systems are now combined with telecommunication and IT technologies to provide new functionality, flexibility and connectivity over both [[Local area network|local]] and [[wide area network]]s. AES47 was developed to provide a standardised method of transporting the standard digital audio per [[AES3]] over telecommunications networks that provide a [[quality of service]] required by many professional [[Latency (audio)|low-latency]] live audio uses. AES47 may be used directly between specialist audio devices or in combination with telecommunication and computer equipment with suitable network interfaces. In both cases, AES47 the same physical structured cable used as standard by the telecommunications networks.

Common network protocols like [[Ethernet]] use large packet sizes, which produce a larger minimum latency.  Asynchronous transfer mode divides data into 48-byte ''cells'' which provide lower latency.&lt;!--Kvng RTH--&gt;

==History==
The original work was carried out at the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]]’s R&amp;D department and published as "White Paper 074",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/publications/whitepaper074 |id=WHP 074 |date=September 2003 |title=The development of ATM network technology for live production infrastructure |first=C.J. |last=Chambers |publisher=BBC Research &amp; Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; which established that this approach provides the necessary performance for professional media production.  AES47 was originally published in 2002 and was republished with minor revisions in February 2006. Amendment 1 to AES47 was published in February 2009, adding code points in the ATM Adaptation Layer Parameters Information Element to signal that the time to which each audio sample relates can be identified as specified in [[AES53]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aes.org/publications/standards/ Audio Engineering Society standards web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The change in thinking from traditional ATM network design is not to necessarily use ATM to pass IP traffic (apart from management traffic) but to use AES47 in parallel with standard Ethernet structures to deal with extremely high performance secure media streams. 

AES47 has been developed to allow the simultaneous transport and switched distribution of a large number of [[AES3]] linear audio streams at different sample frequencies. AES47 can support any of the standard AES3 sample rates and word size. [[AES11]] Annex D (the November 2005 printing or version of AES11-2003) shows an example method to provide [[isochronous]] timing relationships for distributed AES3 structures over asynchronous networks such as AES47 where reference signals may be locked to common timing sources such as [[GPS]]. [[AES53]] specifies how timing markers within AES47 can be used to associate an absolute time stamp with individual audio samples as described in AES47 Amendment 1.

An additional standard has been published by the [[Audio Engineering Society]] to extend [[AES3]] digital audio carried as AES47 streams to enable this to be transported over standard physical [[Ethernet]] hardware. This additional standard is known as [[AES51]]-2006.

==AES47 details==
For minimum latency, AES47 uses "raw" ATM cells, [[ATM adaptation layer]] 0.  Each ATM virtual circuit negotiates the parameters of a stream at connection time.  In addition to the same rate and number of channels (which may be more than the 2 supported by AES3), the negotiation covers the number of bits per sample and the presence of an optional data byte.  The total must be 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6 bytes per sample, so it evenly divides the ATM cell size.&lt;ref name=Rumsey&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Interface Handbook |edition=3rd |chapter=5.4 AES47: Audio Over ATM |last1=Rumsey |first1=Francis |last2=Watkinson |first2=John |date=September 2003 |isbn=0-240-51909-4 |publisher=Focal press |url=http://flylib.com/books/en/4.485.1.1/1/ |chapter-url=http://flylib.com/books/en/4.485.1.75/1/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AES3 uses 4 bytes per sample (24 bits of sample plus the optional data byte), but AES47 supports additional formats.

The optional data byte contains four "ancillary" bits corresponding to the AES3 VUCP bits.  However, the P (parity) bit is replaced by a B bit which is set on the first sample of each audio block, and clear at all other times.  This serves the same function as the B (or Z) synchronization preamble.

The other half of the data byte contains three "data protection" bits for [[error control]] and a sequencing bit.  The concatenation of the sequencing bits from all samples in a cell (combined little-endian) form a sequencing word of 8, 12, 16, or 24 bits.  Only the first 12 bits are defined.

The first four bits of the sequencing word are a sequencing number, used to detect dropped cells.  This increments by 1 for each cell transmitted.

The second four bits are for error detection, with bit 7 being an [[even parity]] bit for the first byte.

The third four bits, if present, are a second sequencing number which can be used to align multiple virtual circuits.

'''[[Angel]]s''' have appeared in works of [[art]] since early Christian art, and they have been a popular subject for [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Europe]]an paintings and sculpture.

Angels are usually intended, in both Christian and Islamic art, to be beautiful, though several depictions go for more awesome/frightening attributes, notably in the depiction of the [[Living creatures (Bible)|living creatures]] (which have beastial characteristics), [[ophanim]] (which are unanthropomorphic wheels) and [[cherubim]] (which have mosaic features);&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Alice. Of Wing and Wheels: A Synthetic Study of the Biblical Cherubim. pp. 2–4. {{ISBN|978-3-11-020528-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a matter of theology, they are spiritual beings who do not eat or excrete and are genderless. Many angels in art may appear to the modern eye to be gendered as either male or female by their dress or actions, but until the 19th century, even the most female looking will normally lack breasts, and the figures should normally be considered as genderless.&lt;ref&gt;"Because angels are purely spiritual creatures without bodies, there is no sexual difference between them. There are no male or female angels; they are not distinguished by gender.", p. 10, "Catholic Questions, Wise Answers", Ed. Michael J. Daley, St. Anthony Messenger Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0867163984}}, 9780867163988. See also [https://www.catholic.com/qa/can-angels-be-male-or-female Catholic Answers], which gives the standard, unchanged, Catholic position.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 19th-century art, especially [[funerary art]], this traditional convention is sometimes abandoned.

===In the Early Church===
Specific ideas regarding how to portray angels began to develop in the early Church. Since angels are defined as pure spirits,
&lt;ref name=gorgievski&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fYareuHCAu0C&amp;pg=PA1 Gorgievski, Sandra. ''Face to Face with Angels: Images in Medieval Art and in Film''], McFarland (2010) {{ISBN|9780786457564}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=longhurst&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1908542/The_Science_of_Angelology_in_the_Modern_World_-_The_Revival_of_Angels_in_Contemporary_Culture Longhurst S.T.D., Christopher Evan. "The Science of Angelology in the Modern World: The Revival of Angels in Contemporary Culture", ''The Catholic Response''], Volume IX, No.2, September/October 2012 (pp. 32-36) {{ISSN|1553-0221}}&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of a defined form has allowed artists wide latitude for creativity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sky.com/story/1185507/angels-exist-but-have-no-wings-says-church "Angels Exist But Have No Wings, Says Church", ''Skye News'', 20 December 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel 8:15 describes Gabriel as appearing in the "likeness of man" and in Daniel 9:21 he is referred to as "the man Gabriel." Such anthropomorphic descriptions of an angel are consistent with previous descriptions of angels, as in Genesis 19:5.&lt;ref name=everson&gt;[http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/gabriel357902.shtml Everson, David. "Gabriel Blow Your Horn! - A Short History of Gabriel within Jewish Literature", Xavier University, December 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428000000/http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/gabriel357902.shtml |date=28 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were usually depicted in the form of young men.&lt;ref name=marshall&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UvZNzngArGQC&amp;pg=PA1 Marshall, Peter and Walsham, Alexandra (editors). ''Angles in the Early Modern World''], p. 5, Cambridege University Press (2006), {{ISBN|9780521843324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known Christian image of an angel, in the ''Cubicolo dell'Annunziazione'' in the [[Catacomb of Priscilla]], which is dated to the middle of the third century, is a depiction of the Annunciation in which Gabriel is portrayed without wings. Representations of angels on [[sarcophagi]] and on objects such as lamps and [[reliquaries]] of that period also show them without wings,&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007), pp. 81-89; cf. review in ''[[La Civiltà Cattolica]]'', 3795-3796 (2–16 August 2008), pp. 327-328.&lt;/ref&gt; as for example the angel in the ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac]]'' scene in the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]].

In a third-century fresco of the Hebrew children in the furnace, in the cemetery of St. Priscilla, a dove takes the place of the angel, while a fourth-century representation of the same subject, in the coemeterium majus, substitutes the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] for the heavenly messenger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01485a.htm Hassett, Maurice. "Early Christian Representations of Angels." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 25 Dec. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known representation of angels with wings is on what is called the Prince's Sarcophagus, discovered at Sarigüzel, near [[Istanbul]], in the 1930s, and attributed to the time of [[Theodosius I]] (379-395).&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;  Flying winged angels, very often in pairs flanking a central figure or subject, are derivations in visual terms from pairs of [[Victoria (mythology)|winged Victories]] in classical art.&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt;

In this same period, Saint [[John Chrysostom]] explained the significance of angels' wings: "They manifest a nature's sublimity. That is why Gabriel is represented with wings. Not that angels have wings, but that you may know that they leave the heights and the most elevated dwelling to approach human nature. Accordingly, the wings attributed to these powers have no other meaning than to indicate the sublimity of their nature."&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

From then on Christian art generally represented angels with wings, as in the cycle of mosaics in the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] (432-440).&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007), pp. 90-95; cf. review in ''[[La Civiltà Cattolica]]'', 3795-3796 (2–16 August 2008), pp. 327-328.&lt;/ref&gt;  Multi-winged angels, often with only their face and wings showing, drawn from the higher grades of angels, especially [[cherubim]] and [[seraphim]], are derived from Persian art, and are usually shown only in heavenly contexts, as opposed to performing tasks on earth.  They often appear in the [[pendentive]]s of [[dome]]s or [[semi-dome]]s of churches.

===Byzantine art===
[[File:Erzengel Michael und Gabriel.jpg|thumb|12th century [[icon]] of the Archangels [[Michael (angel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]] wearing the ''[[loros]]'' of the Imperial guards.]]

Angels appear in Byzantine art in mosaics and icons. Artists found some of their inspiration from winged Greek figures such as "Victory". They also drew from imperial iconography. Court eunuchs could rise to positions of authority in the Empire. They performed ceremonial functions and served as trusted messengers. Amelia R. Brown points out that legislation under Justinian indicates that many of them came from the Caucasus, having light eyes, hair, and skin, as well as the "comely features and fine bodies" desired by slave traders.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;  Those "castrated in childhood developed a distinctive skeletal structure, lacked full masculine musculature, body hair and beards,...." As officials, they would wear a white tunic decorated with gold. Brown suggests that  "Byzantine artists drew, consciously or not, on this iconography of the court eunuch".&lt;ref name=brown&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1053017/Painting_the_Bodiless_Angels_and_Eunuchs_in_Byzantine_Art_and_Culture Brown, Amelia R., "Painting the Bodiless: Angels and Eunuchs in Byzantine Art and Culture", University of Queensland (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel 10: 5-6 describes an angel as clothed in linen and girt with gold.&lt;ref name=longhurst/&gt; Angels, especially the archangel Michael, who were depicted as military-style agents of God, came to be shown wearing [[Late Antique]] military uniform.  This could be either the normal military dress, with a tunic to about the knees, armour breastplate and [[pteruges]], but also often the specific dress of the bodyguard of the [[Byzantine Emperor]], with a long tunic and the ''[[loros]]'', a long gold and jewelled  [[pallium]] restricted to the Imperial family and their closest guards, and in icons to archangels.  The basic military dress it is still worn in pictures into the [[Baroque]] period and beyond in the West, and up to the present day in [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s. Other angels came to be conventionally depicted in long robes.

===Medieval art===
Medieval depictions of angels borrow from the Byzantine. In the French ''Hours of Anne of Brittany'', Gabriel wears a dalmatic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9QQFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA54 Andre, J. Lewis. "The Icons and Emblems of the Holy Angels", ''The Belfry: Quarterly Papers on Art, History and Archaeology'', No. III, Burns &amp; Oates, London, October 1876,]&lt;/ref&gt; In the later Middle Ages they often wear the vestments of a [[deacon]], a [[cope]] over a [[dalmatic]], especially [[Gabriel]] in [[Annunciation]] scenes - for example ''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|The Annunciation]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]]. This indicated that, for all their powers, they could not perform the [[Eucharist]], and were in this respect outranked by every priest, reinforcing the prestige of the clergy.  In [[Early Christian art]] white robes were almost invariably adopted, sometimes bound with the "golden girdle" of Revelation. During the mediæval period senior angels were often clad in every brilliant colour,&lt;ref name=vinycomb&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/lcr/fsca/fsca08.htm Vinycomb, John. ''Fictitious and Symbolic Creatures in Art'', p.30, Chapman and Hall, London(1909)]&lt;/ref&gt; while junior ranks wore white. Early Renaissance painters such as [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Fra Angelico]] painted angels with multi-colored wings.  Depictions of angels came to combine medieval notions of beauty with feminine ideals of grace and beauty, as in da Panicale's 1435 ''Baptism of Christ''.&lt;ref name=gorgievski/&gt;

===Renaissance art===
[[File:ANGELICO, Fra Annunciation, 1437-46 (2236990916).jpg|thumb|left|Fra Angelico, The Annunciation, 1437-46]]
The classical ''[[erotes]]'' or ''[[putto]]'' re-appeared in art during the [[Italian Renaissance]] in both religious and mythological art, and is often known in English as a [[cherub]], the singular of cherubim, actually one of the higher ranks in the [[Christian angelic hierarchy]].  They normally appear in groups and are generally given wings in religious art, and are sometimes represented as just a winged head.  They generally are just in attendance, except that they may be amusing Christ or [[John the Baptist]] as infants in scenes of the [[Holy Family]].

===Victorian art===
In the late 19th century artists' model [[Jane Morris|Jane Burden Morris]] came to embody an ideal of beauty for [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painters. With the use of her long dark hair and features made somewhat more androgynous, they created a prototype Victorian angel which would appear in paintings and stained glass windows. Roger Homan notes that [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and others used her image often and in different ways, creating a new type of angel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/000614.php Homan, Roger. "Jane Burden: How a Pre-Raphaelite model changed our image of angels", ''The Social Affairs Unit'', 14 October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Islamic art ==
According to Islamic teaching, angels are made of light, are beautiful, and have wings; although the shape and form of the wings are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iris.org.nz/angels.php Islamic Resource &amp; Information Service (IRIS), New Zealand] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410081112/http://www.iris.org.nz/angels.php |date=10 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islamic art]] angels mainly appear mainly in narrative scenes in miniature painting, in the [[Persian miniature|Persian]] [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] and [[Ottoman miniature|Ottoman]] traditions.  They are especially common in illustrations of the Prophet's [[Mi'raj]], one of the occasions where their presence is mentioned in the [[Quran]].  Their appearance generally draws more from the [[iconography]] of pre-Islamic Persia, and [[Buddhist art]], than from angels in Christian art. Some of the earliest [[Ilkhanid]] examples are exceptions to this.  They have wings, often multi-coloured,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/angels-fly-on-high-multicolored-wings.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=27524&amp;NewsCatID=438 Gamm, Niki. Angels fly on high multicolored wings", ''Hurriyit Daily News'' Istanbul, Turkey, 11 August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and very often floating scarves drawing from Chinese Buddhist art. They are not very common however; many appear in illustrations to biographical accounts of the life of the Prophet [[Muhammad]], which are themselves rare.  There are a few studies of angels by themselves, especially from [[Safavid]] Persia.

In Islamic holy book, God rejects the depictions of angel as female in several verses of [[Quran]],&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Maulana Muhammad. ''The Holy Qur'an''. [[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an (Maulana Muhammad Ali)/37. Those Ranging in Ranks|chapter 37:149-150]].&lt;/ref&gt; and He will question those who make the depiction.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Maulana Muhammad. ''The Holy Qur'an''.  [[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an (Maulana Muhammad Ali)/43. Gold|chapter 43:19-20]].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10670">'''Astronomical chronology''', or '''astronomical dating''', is a technical method of dating events or artifacts that are associated with astronomical phenomena.  Written records of historical events that include descriptions of astronomical phenomena have done much to clarify the chronology of the [[Ancient Near East]]; works of art which depict the configuration of the stars and planets and buildings which are oriented to the rising and setting of celestial bodies at a particular time have all been dated through astronomical calculations.

==Dating historical events==

The use of descriptions of astronomical phenomena to date historical events began in the 16th century, a time of a renewed humanistic interest in history and of increasingly precise astronomical tables.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton, "Some Uses of Eclipses in Early Modern Chronology," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', 64 (2003): 213-229.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eclipse]]s in particular are relatively infrequent events and can be dated precisely.  When the circumstances are not exact and descriptions leave ambiguities, one can often use other details such as the month of the eclipse or the position of other stars and planets to identify the specific eclipse.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. R. Stephenson]] and J. M. Steele, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006JHA....37...55S "Astronomical Dating of Babylonian Texts Describing the Total Solar Eclipse of S.E. 175"], ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', 37 (2006): 55-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomical dating, like other forms of historical interpretation, requires care in interpreting the surviving written records.  John Steele has proposed three questions that must be asked when dating an event:  Does the record refer to an actual astronomical event, or is this merely a modern assumption?  If it does refer to an actual astronomical event, is the source reliable?  Can the record provide an unambiguous date without making unwarranted assumptions about ancient astronomical observational methods?&lt;ref&gt;John M. Steele, "The Use and Abuse of Astronomy in Establishing Ancient Chronologies," ''Physics in Canada/La Physique au Canada'', 59 (2003): 243-8, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Babylonian astronomical diaries]] provide detailed and unambiguous accounts of the positions of all the visible planets, often in relation to specific stars, that have been used to provide precise dates of events like the defeat of [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III]] by [[Alexander the Great]] at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] on 1 October 331 BCE and of Alexander's subsequent death on 11 June 323.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jona Lendering]], [http://www.pothos.org/content/index.php?page=astronomical-diaries "Astronomical Diaries"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514150612/http://www.pothos.org/content/index.php?page=astronomical-diaries |date=2011-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the success of this method depends on the reliability of the written sources and the precision of their accounts of astronomical phenomena, attempts to date literary texts which may describe astronomical events loosely or even as metaphors have led researchers to conclusions that appear precise, but rely on invalid assumptions and are consequently less widely accepted.  Thus the attempts to date [[Vedas|Vedic texts]] describing the [[Pleiades]] as rising "due East" to about 2300 BCE, which is the time when the Pleiades rose "exactly" due East, is complicated by the fact that poetic descriptions need not be taken as reflecting precise astronomical observations, while [[Axial precession|precession]] is a very slow process which makes only small changes in the azimuth of a star rising in the East.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Witzel]], "The Pleiades and the Bears viewed from inside the Vedic texts," [http://www.ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/ejvs0502/ejvs0502.txt ''Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320070909/http://www.ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/ejvs0502/ejvs0502.txt |date=March 20, 2008 }}, 5 (1999), issue 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating artifacts==

[[File:Aratea 93v.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|Ninth century diagram of the positions of the [[Classical planet|seven planets]] on 18 March 816.]]
Among the artifacts that can most readily be dated by astronomical techniques are depictions of the positions of the [[celestial bodies]] at a particular time.  Since the motions of the celestial bodies are all at different periods, it takes many centuries for all the planets plus the Sun and the Moon, to reach the same positions in the signs of the [[Zodiac]].  For a configuration accurate to ±15° (that is, within a single [[Zodiac#Western zodiac|sign]]) the positions of these seven bodies will only return to the same configuration once in about 3700 years.  A particular case involved a medieval [[illuminated manuscript]] which portrayed the position of these seven celestial bodies on 18 March 816; corresponding to the period when the manuscript was written. This calculation demonstrated that this illustration was not a copy of an earlier classical depiction of the position of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Mostert and Marco Mostert, "Using astronomy as an aid to dating manuscripts, The example of the [[Leiden Aratea]] planetarium", ''[[Quaerendo]]'', 20 (1999): 248-261; see esp. § 6. Reliability of the Dating Method, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;  The rapidly moving Moon is the most sensitive indicator for the exact time; if one can estimate the indicated position of the Moon to within a degree, the time of the diagram can be computed to within an hour.&lt;ref&gt;William D. Stahlman, "Astronomical Dating Applied to a Type of Astrological Illustration," ''Isis'', 47 (1956): 154-160, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

A striking example of this method was an astrological portrait of Sir [[Christopher Hatton]] (1540–1591), which depicted the positions of the seven classical planets in the zodiac and noted the computed positions of the planets to the nearest minute of arc.  Here the largest source of error in the date was the uncertainty of 16th-century astronomical calculations.  The resulting time was about noon of 12 December 1581.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Beer, "Astronomical dating of works of art", ''Vistas in Astronomy'', 9 (1967): 177-223.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating structures by their orientation==

A more controversial [[Archaeoastronomy|archaeoastronomical]] approach has been used to date structures that are believed to have been oriented on astronomical principles by measuring their orientation and computing the date in the past when a single specified celestial body, whether the Sun or a selected star, rises or sets at the measured azimuth.  The astronomer, [[Norman Lockyer]], applied this method to [[Stonehenge]]&lt;ref&gt;Norman Lockyer and  F. C. Penrose, "An Attempt to Ascertain the Date of the Original Construction of Stonehenge from Its Orientation", ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London'', 69. (1901 - 1902): 137-147.&lt;/ref&gt; by measuring the orientation of the Stonehenge avenue and comparing it to the position of solstitial sunrise, which changes slowly due to the changing [[obliquity of the ecliptic]]. The archaeologist, F. C. Penrose, applied a similar method to ancient Greek Temples, attempting to establish their dates by relating their orientation to the appearance of stars on the horizon, the position of which changes slowly due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].&lt;ref&gt;F. C. Penrose, "On the Results of an Examination of the Orientations of a Number of Greek Temples with a View to Connect these Angles with the Amplitudes of Certain Stars at the Time the Temples were Founded, and an Endeavour to Derive therefrom the Dates of their Foundation by Consideration of the Changes Produced upon the Right Ascension and Declination of the Stars by the Precession of the Equinoxes", ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', A, 184 (1893): 805-834.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wide variance of these dates from historically accepted ones led the architect and archaeologist, [[William Bell Dinsmoor]], to mistrust dates established by the slowly changing obliquity of the ecliptic or by stellar alignments, which involve an arbitrary selection of a star that rises on the proper azimuth.  Instead he proposed a method employing what was already known from historical records concerning the dates of construction of Greek temples, the festivals associated with specific temples, and the nature of the Greek [[Lunisolar calendar]].  Since the date of a festival in the Greek lunisolar calendar only recurs on the same date in the solar calendar every eight or nineteen years, Dinsmoor identified a festival connected with a specific temple and was able to determine the exact year near the historically recorded construction date when the Sun rose in alignment with the temple on the date of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;William Bell Dinsmoor, "Archæology and Astronomy", ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'', 10 (1939): 95-173.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Atmospheric sciences}}
'''Atmospheric chemistry''' is a branch of [[atmospheric science]] in which the [[chemistry]] of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] and that of other planets is studied. It is a [[multidisciplinary approach]] of research and draws on [[environmental chemistry]], [[physics]], [[meteorology]], [[computer modeling]], [[oceanography]], [[geology]] and [[volcanology]] and other disciplines. Research is increasingly connected with other arenas of study such as [[climatology]].

The composition and chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere is of importance for several reasons, but primarily because of the interactions between the atmosphere and [[living organisms]]. The composition of the Earth's atmosphere changes as result of natural processes such as [[volcano]] emissions, [[lightning]] and bombardment by solar particles from [[corona]]. It has also been changed by human activity and some of these changes are harmful to human health, crops and ecosystems. Examples of problems which have been addressed by atmospheric chemistry include [[acid rain]], [[ozone depletion]], [[photochemical smog]], [[greenhouse gas]]es and [[global warming]]. Atmospheric chemists seek to understand the causes of these problems, and by obtaining a theoretical understanding of them, allow possible solutions to be tested and the effects of changes in government policy evaluated.

== History ==
[[Image:Atmosphere composition diagram-en.svg|thumb|290px|left|Schematic of chemical and transport processes related to atmospheric composition.]]
The ancient [[Greeks]] regarded air as one of the [[four elements]]. The first scientific studies of atmospheric composition began in the 18th century, as chemists such as [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Henry Cavendish]] made the first measurements of the composition of the atmosphere.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries interest shifted towards trace constituents with very small concentrations. One particularly important discovery for atmospheric chemistry was the discovery of [[ozone]] by [[Christian Friedrich Schönbein]] in 1840.

In the 20th century atmospheric science moved on from studying the composition of air to a consideration of how the concentrations of trace gases in the atmosphere have changed over time and the chemical processes which create and destroy compounds in the air. Two particularly important examples of this were the explanation by [[Sydney Chapman (astronomer)|Sydney Chapman]] and [[Gordon Dobson]] of how the [[ozone layer]] is created and maintained, and the explanation of [[photochemical smog]] by [[Arie Jan Haagen-Smit]]. Further studies on ozone issues led to the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry award shared between [[Paul Crutzen]], [[Mario Molina]] and [[Frank Sherwood Rowland]].&lt;ref name= "NobelPrize1995"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1995/press-release/ |title=Press Release - 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=October 11, 1995 |website=The Nobel Prize |publisher=Nobel Prize Org |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century the focus is now shifting again. Atmospheric chemistry is increasingly studied as one part of the [[Earth science#Earth system science|Earth system]]. Instead of concentrating on atmospheric chemistry in isolation the focus is now on seeing it as one part of a single system with the rest of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]],  [[biosphere]] and [[geosphere]]. An especially important driver for this is the links between chemistry and [[climate]] such as the effects of changing climate on the recovery of the ozone hole and vice versa but also interaction of the composition of the atmosphere with the oceans and terrestrial [[ecosystems]].

== Methodology ==
Observations, lab measurements, and modeling are the three central elements in atmospheric chemistry. Progress in atmospheric chemistry is often driven by the interactions between these components and they form an integrated whole. For example, observations may tell us that more of a chemical compound exists than previously thought possible. This will stimulate new modelling and laboratory studies which will increase our scientific understanding to a point where the observations can be explained.

=== Observation ===
Observations of atmospheric chemistry are essential to our understanding. Routine observations of chemical composition tell us about changes in atmospheric composition over time. One important example of this is the [[Keeling Curve]] - a series of measurements from 1958 to today which  show a steady rise in of the concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] (see also [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere#Ongoing measurements of atmospheric CO2|ongoing measurements of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]). Observations of atmospheric chemistry are made in observatories such as that on [[Mauna Loa]] and on mobile platforms such as aircraft (e.g. the UK's [[Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements]]), ships and balloons. Observations of atmospheric composition are increasingly made by [[satellites]] with important instruments such as [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite|GOME]] and [[MOPITT]] giving a global picture of air pollution and chemistry. Surface observations have the advantage that they provide long term records at high time resolution but are limited in the vertical and horizontal space they provide observations from. Some surface based instruments e.g. [[LIDAR]] can provide concentration profiles of chemical compounds and aerosol but are still restricted in the horizontal region they can cover. Many observations are available on line in [[Atmospheric Chemistry Observational Databases]].

=== Laboratory studies ===
Measurements made in the laboratory are essential to our understanding of the sources and sinks of pollutants and naturally occurring compounds. These experiments are performed in controlled environments that allow for the individual evaluation of specific chemical reactions or the assessment of properties of a particular atmospheric constituent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Future of Atmospheric Research: Remembering Yesterday, Understanding Today, Anticipating Tomorrow|vauthors = ((National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine))|publisher=The National Academies Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0-309-44565-8|location=Washington, DC|pages=15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of analysis that are of interest includes both those on gas-phase reactions, as well as [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] reactions that are relevant to the formation and growth of [[aerosol]]s. Also of high importance is the study of atmospheric [[photochemistry]] which quantifies how the rate in which molecules are split apart by sunlight and what resulting products are. In addition, [[thermodynamic]] data such as [[Henry's law]] coefficients can also be obtained.

=== Modeling ===
In order to synthesise and test theoretical understanding of atmospheric chemistry, computer models (such as [[chemical transport model]]s) are used. Numerical models solve the differential equations governing the concentrations of chemicals in the atmosphere. They can be very simple or very complicated. One common trade off in numerical models is between the number of chemical compounds and chemical reactions modelled versus the representation of transport and mixing in the atmosphere. For example, a box model might include hundreds or even thousands of chemical reactions but will only have a very crude representation of mixing in the atmosphere. In contrast, 3D models represent many of the physical processes of the atmosphere but due to constraints on computer resources will have far fewer chemical reactions and compounds. Models can be used to interpret observations, test understanding of chemical reactions and predict future concentrations of chemical compounds in the atmosphere. One important current trend is for atmospheric chemistry modules to become one part of earth system models in which the links between climate, atmospheric composition and the biosphere can be studied.

Some models are constructed by automatic code generators (e.g. [[Autochem]] or [[Kinetic PreProcessor|KPP]]). In this approach a set of constituents are chosen and the automatic code generator will then select the reactions involving those constituents from a set of reaction databases. Once the reactions have been chosen the [[ordinary differential equations]] (ODE) that describe their time evolution can be automatically constructed.

'''Bridge Operational''' (or Operations) '''Quality Assurance''' ('''BOQA''' - pronounced BOUQUA or / bəʊ'kwɒ /) is a methodology utilised in shipping and which originates from the similar FOQA ([[Flight operations quality assurance]]) concept in aviation. BOQA is a methodology with which ship owners/operators, ship Captains, and other associated shipping stakeholders can automatically and systematically monitor, track, trend and analyse operational quality of (seagoing) vessels. The main target with BOQA is to enhance maritime safety and to enable proactive decision making in ship operations. The BOQA methodology can be used in both conventional manned ships and in autonomous or unmanned vessels.

== Description==
BOQA is best developed as a non-punitive company-internal methodology or process, which has the overall target of assisting the ship Captain and the ship operator to maintain a high level of safety and operational quality.

BOQA has been described as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ntsb.gov/news/events/Documents/Panel6_Christie_Carnival_Corp.pdf|title=Innovative Techniques to Enhance Safety|last=Christie|first=David|date=25 March 2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''A system which delivers 24/7 electronic monitoring and electronic alarms when set operational parameters are deviated from''
* ''During normal operations, BOQA will collect and analyse digital operational data direct from ships operation equipment''
* ''BOQA data is unique because it can provide objective information that is not available through other methods''
* ''A BOQA program can identify operational situations in which there is increased risk, allowing operators to take early corrective action before that risk results in an incident or accident'' 
* ''The BOQA program is a tool in the operators overall operational risk assessment and prevention program''
* ''BOQA, being proactive in identifying and addressing risk will enhance safety''

== Methodology ==
BOQA is used to objectively monitor the human operational performance and external factors, such as weather and other traffic around the vessel, by utilising various types of sensor and external data and comparing this data with defined best-practices and [[Standard operating procedure]] (SOPs). BOQA is &lt;u&gt;usually not used&lt;/u&gt; to monitor the internal technical performance of the vessel machinery and equipment-base, which in most cases already has a wide range of proprietary monitoring and alarm functions.

BOQA is often a software system consisting of shipboard real-time data collection and sensing, automated data transmission between the vessel and shore and a shore-based system which receives, combines, analyses, alerts and stores the data according to defined rules and logic.

BOQA usually includes three "time-domains", ie:

# a historical database of data and events and which is used for trend- and pattern analysis
# a real-time reactive stream analytics component which can react to events or deviations in real- or near-real-time (NRT)
# a predictive and pro-active component, which assists the operator in taking actions before an event occurs

=== Event types ===
BOQA is a continuously developing methodology, much in the same way as FOQA. At present time BOQA solutions are known to be able monitor following event types:

* Cross-track error or deviation from a defined navigational route (the [[Costa Concordia disaster]] is known to be caused by such deviation) 
* Safety corridor, ie is the ship sailing within its defined safe waters 
* Collision risk based on Proximity (ship too close to own ship), CPA (Closest point of approach which measures the time and distance to a potential collision) and BCR (Bow Cross Range)
* Entry into a restricted or protected area
* Severe list, heel or roll
* Excessive accelerations
* Excessive turns
* Crash stop
* Heavy weather at present position and along a planned route (this is a predictive component)
* Sudden change in atmospheric pressure (which is an indicator of oncoming change in weather)
* Speed monitoring, which can be used for example in [[Charterparty]] Compliance monitoring
* Unscheduled stops along the route, which may lead to schedule-deviations and unwanted changes in arrival time
* Proximity to a shore line, ice edge or iceberg
* Rescue boat launch
* AIS ([[Automatic identification system]]) status change
* Black-out

=== Inputs ===
BOQA relies on data from various sources. The key data sources are:

* Ship's AIS transponders ([[Automatic identification system]]), which give location, speed and course of the vessel itself and the surrounding traffic
* Ship's GPS ([[Global Positioning System]]), which also gives location, speed and course
* Motion sensors
* Barometric pressure sensors
* Real-time weather data from sensors
* Weather forecast data
* Ship's navigational ECDIS ([[Electronic Chart Display and Information System]]) route
* External geographic data, such as restricted areas, PSSAs ([[Marine protected area]]) or TSS ([[Traffic Separation Scheme]])
* Ship's electronic logbook

== Applications ==
BOQA is not yet known to be officially mandated or regulated by any official maritime bodies, such as [[International Maritime Organization]], Classification societies or Flag state administrations.

[[Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.|Royal Caribbean Cruise]] line stated in their 2012 Stewardship report that they were evaluating a BOQA system. &lt;ref&gt;RCCL 2012 Stewardship report, page 13 "Maritime safety"http://www.royalcaribbean.com/content/en_US/pdf/13034530_RCL_2012StwrdshpTwoPgrs_v4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|In 2011, RCL began evaluating a voyage data recording analysis and trending system, known as Bridge Operations
Quality Assurance (BOQA), based on a similar program used in the aviation industry (the Flight Operations Quality
Assurance program). In 2012 we made progress in the technical development of this system for marine use, and we
have installed two prototypes on our vessels for testing purposes. This system will enhance our data analysis that
supports our accident prevention initiatives.

The process of '''circuit design''' can cover systems ranging from complex [[Electronics|electronic]] systems all the way down to the individual [[transistor]]s within an [[integrated circuit]].  For simple circuits the [[design process]] can often be done by one person without needing a planned or structured design process, but for more complex designs, teams of designers following a systematic approach with intelligently guided [[computer simulation]] are becoming increasingly common.  In integrated circuit [[electronic design automation|design automation]], the term "circuit design" often refers to the step of the design cycle which outputs the [[schematics]] of the integrated circuit. Typically this is the step between [[logic design]] and [[physical design (electronics)|physical design]].&lt;ref&gt;Naveed Sherwani, "Algorithms for VLSI Physical Design Automation"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
[[File:76477 Musical Organ.JPG|thumb|A [[circuit diagram]] for the [[Texas Instruments SN76477]] [[sound chip]]]]
Formal circuit design usually involves a number of stages. Sometimes, a [[design specification]] is written after liaising with the customer.  A [[Product design specification|technical proposal]] may be written to meet the requirements of the customer specification.  The next stage involves [[Logic synthesis|synthesising]] on paper a [[schematic]] [[circuit diagram]], an abstract electrical or electronic circuit that will meet the specifications.  A calculation of the component values to meet the operating specifications under specified conditions should be made. Simulations may be performed to [[Verification and validation|verify]] the correctness of the design.

A [[breadboard]] or other prototype version of the design for testing against specification may be built. It may involve the making of any alterations to the circuit to achieve compliance.  A choice as to a method of construction as well as all the parts and materials to be used must be made. There is a presentation of component and layout information to draughtspersons, and layout and mechanical engineers, for prototype production. This is followed by the testing or type-testing a number of prototypes to ensure compliance with customer requirements. Usually there is a signing and approval of the final manufacturing drawings and there may be post-design services ([[obsolescence]] of components etc.).

== Specification ==
[[File:Mikroel 0141 lille4.jpg|thumb|[[Microchip]]s]]
{{main|Product design specification}}
The process of circuit design begins with the [[specification]], which states the functionality that the finished design must provide, but does not indicate how it is to be achieved .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lam |first=William K. |url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=392278 |title=Does Your Design Meet Its Specs? Introduction to Hardware Design Verification &amp;#124; What Is Design Verification? |website=Informit.com |date=2005-08-19 |accessdate=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The initial specification is basically a technically detailed description of what the customer wants the finished circuit to achieve and can include a variety of [[Power network design (IC)|electrical requirements]], such as what signals the circuit will receive, what signals it must output, what power supplies are available and how much power it is permitted to consume.  The specification can (and normally does) also set some of the physical parameters that the design must meet, such as size, weight, [[Moisture sensitivity level|moisture resistance]], temperature range, thermal output, vibration tolerance and acceleration tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;A. Tajalli, et al., "Design trade-offs in ultra-low-power digital nanoscale CMOS," IEEE TCAS-I 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the design process progresses the designer(s) will frequently return to the specification and alter it to take account of the progress of the design. This can involve tightening specifications that the customer has supplied, and adding tests that the circuit must pass in order to be accepted.  These additional specifications will often be used in the verification of a design.  Changes that conflict with or modify the customer's original specifications will almost always have to be approved by the customer before they can be acted upon.

Correctly identifying the customer needs can avoid a condition known as 'design creep' which occurs in the absence of realistic initial expectations, and later by failing to communicate fully with the client during the design process. It can be defined in terms of its results; "at one extreme is a circuit with more functionality than necessary, and at the other is a circuit having an incorrect functionality".&lt;ref&gt;DeMers, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;{{Who?|date=September 2016}} Nevertheless, some changes can be expected and it is good practice to keep options open for as long as possible because it's easier to remove spare elements from the circuit later on than it is to put them in.

== Design ==
[[File:ALU Block Diagram.png|thumb|A [[block diagram]] of 4-bit [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]]]]
The design process involves moving from the specification at the start, to a plan that contains all the information needed to be physically constructed at the end, this normally happens by passing through a number of stages, although in very simple circuit it may be done in a single step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informit.com/content/images/chap1_0131433474/elementLinks/01fig01.gif/ |format=GIF |title=Design Flow Chart |website=Informit.com |accessdate=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The process normally begins with the conversion of the specification into a [[block diagram]] of the various functions that the circuit must perform, at this stage the contents of each block are not considered, only what each block must do, this is sometimes referred to as a "[[Black box (systems)|black box]]" design.  This approach allows the possibly very complicated task to be broken into smaller tasks which may either by tackled in sequence or divided amongst members of a design team.

Each block is then considered in more detail, still at an abstract stage, but with a lot more focus on the details of the electrical functions to be provided. At this or later stages it is common to require a large amount of research or [[mathematical modeling]] into what is and is not feasible to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ee205/Labs97S/Lab4.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830040341/http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ee205/Labs97S/Lab4.html |archivedate=2005-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The results of this research may be fed back into earlier stages of the design process, for example if it turns out one of the blocks cannot be designed within the parameters set for it, it may be necessary to alter other blocks instead.  At this point it is also common to start considering both how to demonstrate that the design does meet the specifications, and how it is to be tested ( which can include [[On Board Diagnostics|self diagnostic]] tools ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.besttest.com/Courses/DFTBIST.cfm |title=A.T.E. Solutions, Inc. &amp;#124; Design for Testability and for Built-In Self Test |website=Besttest.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901160934/http://besttest.com/Courses/DFTBIST.cfm |archivedate=2016-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Componentes electronicos.jpg|thumb|Individual circuit [[Electronic component|components]]]]
Finally the individual circuit [[Electronic component|components]] are chosen to carry out each function in the overall design, at this stage the physical layout and electrical connections of each component are also decided, this layout commonly taking the form of artwork for the production of a [[printed circuit board]] or Integrated circuit.  This stage is typically extremely time consuming because of the vast array of choices available.  A practical constraint on the design at this stage is that of standardization, while a certain value of component may be calculated for use in some location in a circuit, if that value cannot be purchased from a supplier, then the problem has still not been solved. To avoid this a certain amount of 'catalog engineering' can be applied to solve the more mundane tasks within an overall design.

One area of rapid technology development is in the field of [[nanoelectronics|nanoelectronic]] circuit design.&lt;ref name="nanocir"&gt;{{cite book |title=Nanoelectronic Circuit Design |editor1-first=Niraj K. |editor1-last=Jha |editor2-first=Deming |editor2-last=Chen |chapter=A Hybrid System/CMOS Dynamically Reconfigurable System |last=Zhang |first=Wei |author2=Niraj K. Jha |author3=Li Shang |year=2010 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=1441976094 |page=97 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=5Gi42-ZpMtQ |accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costs ===
Proper design philosophy and structure incorporates economic and technical considerations and keeps them in balance at all times, and right from the start. Balance is the key concept here; just as many delays and pitfalls can come from ill-considered cost cutting as with cost overruns. Good accounting tools (and a design culture that fosters their use) is imperative for a successful project.  "Manufacturing costs shrink as design costs soar," is often quoted as a truism in circuit design, particularly for ICs.

== Verification and testing ==
Once a circuit has been designed, it must be both [[formal verification|verified]] and tested. Verification is the process of going through each stage of a design and ensuring that it will do what the specification requires it to do. This is frequently a highly mathematical process and can involve large-scale computer simulations of the design.  In any complicated design it is very likely that problems will be found at this stage and may involve a large amount of the design work be redone in order to fix them.

Testing is the real-world counterpart to verification, testing involves physically building at least a prototype of the design and then (in combination with the test procedures in the specification or added to it) checking the circuit really does do what it was designed to.

== Prototyping ==
[[Prototyping]] is a means of exploring ideas before an investment is made in them. Depending on the scope of the [[prototype]] and the level of detail required, prototypes can be built at any time during the project. Sometimes they are created early in the project, during the planning and specification phase, commonly using a process known as [[breadboard]]ing; that's when the need for exploration is greatest, and when the time investment needed is most viable. Later in the cycle packaging [[mock-up]]s are used to explore appearance and usability, and occasionally a circuit will need to be modified to take these factors into account.

== Results ==
As circuit design is the process of working out the physical form that an electronic circuit will take, the result of the circuit design process is the instructions on how to construct the physical electronic circuit. This will normally take the form of blueprints describing the size, shape, connectors, etc., in use, and artwork or [[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]] file for manufacturing a [[printed circuit board]] or [[integrated circuit]].

=== Documentation ===
Any commercial design will normally also include an element of documentation, the precise nature of this documentation will vary according to the size and complexity of the circuit as well as the country in which it is to be used.  As a bare minimum the documentation will normally include at least the specification and testing procedures for the design and a statement of compliance with current regulations.  In the [[European Union|EU]] this last item will normally take the form of a [[CE mark|CE Declaration]] listing the European directives complied with and naming an individual responsible for compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ita.doc.gov/td/tic/ce_mark/ceFAQ.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126070550/http://www.ita.doc.gov/td/tic/ce_mark/ceFAQ.htm |archivedate=2005-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching''', also referred to as the '''Cognitive Theory of Interactive Teaching''', was developed by Allan Collins and Albert L. Stevens (Collins &amp; Stevens, 1981).  Allan Collins was a chief scientist at Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc., a research firm in Cambridge Massachusetts. He is also a specialist in the field of [[cognitive science]] and human semantic processing.  Albert L. Stevens was a senior scientist at Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. He was also director of the company's [[Artificial Intelligence]], [[Education Technology]] and Training Systems Division.  He is also a specialist in cognitive science. (Reigeluth, 1983)
The Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching according to Collins and Stevens (1981) requires the learner to construct theories and principles through dialogue, the teaching of self-questioning techniques and the teaching of [[metacognitive]] or [[self-monitoring]] skills, all with the intent of clarifying misconceptions so the theory or principle is well articulated and developed.  The essence of the cognitive theory of Inquiry teaching is that of developing students' metacognitive skills. Inquiry teaching deliberately attempts to develop these stills through instruction.

The theory is a prescriptive model rooted in the discovery tradition and cognitive sciences. It was derived form an analysis of the transcripts of teachers, described as interactive teachers, using a variety of teaching strategies. These strategies were in some way related to one of the following methodology: the inquiry method of the teaching, discovery method of teaching and Socratic method of teaching.  The transcripts studied represent a variety of topics taught by teachers across different subject areas (Reigeluth, 1983). Collins and Stevens believed that their Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching is domain independent or that it can be applied across subject areas or the curriculum.

== Historical background ==
Inquiry teaching is rooted in the didactic methodologies of the ancient Greek. According Mayer and Alexander (2011), inquiry teaching is rooted in the didactic methodology of the ancient Greek, where the teacher poses a problem and assists the student in solving that problem by asking a series of question. They have also pointed out that this method of instruction can be seen in the works of Plato and Socrates.
Bransford, Franks and Sherwood (1989), as cited by Mayer and Alexander (2011), have indicated that it was not until the 1960s that the role of teachers started to change from where the teacher provided the student with the questions as well as the answers. After the 1960s, instruction provided greater opportunity for students to engage in creating their own answers to questions posed (Mayer &amp; Alexander, 2011).

== Characteristics ==
The purpose of the Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching according to Collins (1986) is to provide learners with the opportunity to “actively engage in articulating theories and principles that are critical to deep understanding of a domain” (p.1). Collins (1986) believes that the knowledge attained will allow the learner to actively and meaningfully engage in solving problems and making predictions.  He also indicated that the knowledge acquire is not simply content knowledge. Figure 1 summarizes Collins and Stevens Theory of Inquiry Teaching.

The Cognitive Theory of Inquiry (Interactive) Teaching according to the Reigeluth (1983) consists of three parts: 
# The teachers goals
# The teaching strategies employed by teachers
# The controlling structures used to govern their teaching.

There are two main goals teachers using the inquiry method seek to achieve, according to Collin and Stevens (1981): 
# The teaching of a particular rule or theory
# Teaching students how to derive the rule or theory.

These two main goals are associated with several sub-goals. The list below identifies the two main goals and their associated sub-goal as posited by Collins and Stevens (1981):
#The teaching of a particular rule or theory
#* Analyzing and addressing misconceptions of students hypotheses
#* Students are taught how to make prediction in new situations
#Teaching students how to derive the rule or theory
#* Students are taught what questions to ask
#* Students are taught the nature of the theory or rule
#* Students are taught how to test the rule or theory
#* Student are taught how to articulate and defend the rule or theory

== Teaching strategies employed by teachers ==
Collins and Stevens (1981) have highlighted ten teaching strategies used by teachers using inquiry teaching. They believed that these ten teaching strategies, listed below, are the most important ones identified in their investigation. These ten teaching strategies identified by Collin and Stevens (1981, p. 18) are:
#Selecting positive and negative exemplars
#Varying cases systematically
#Selecting counterexamples 
#Generating hypothetical cases 
#Forming hypotheses 
#Testing hypotheses 
#Considering alternative predictions 
#Entrapping students 
#Tracing consequences to a contradiction 
#Questioning authority
 
== Controlling structures used to govern their teaching ==
Colling and Stevens (1981) indicated that the time allocated between the teachers' goals and sub-goals is critical to the effectiveness of inquiry teaching. Collins and Stevens (1977), as cited by Collins and Stevens (1981) had made an attempt at developing a theory of controlling structures after getting feedback from several tutors. This controlling structure theory consisted of four parts. The four parts this theory includes the following: 
#"a set of strategies for selecting cases with respect to the main goals,
#a student model,
#an agenda,
#a set of priority rules for adding goals and sub-goals to the agenda." (p. 47)
Collins and Stevens (1981) have suggested that base on the goals of the teacher, cases are selected to ensure that student develop mastery of the principles or theories being taught. They have also indicated that teachers appear to develop some strategies for selecting cases to develop students' mastery of the principles or theories. These are some of the strategies used by teachers for selecting cases as mentioned by Collins and Stevens (1981):
#cases that demonstrated the more important factors were selected before those that have less important factors
#the cases selected were sequenced from concrete factors to abstract factors
#the selection of cases dependent on their importance and frequency: more important or frequent to less important and less frequent
According to Collins and Stevens the controlling structure used to govern the dialogue in the Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching is demonstrated in the following manner:
#A case is chosen, which is a theory or principle, based on the main goal of the teacher. The teacher then questions students to determine their understanding of the theory. Students' answers reveal their understanding or lack of understanding. Next, the teacher tags the theory or principle based what students know, their error and what they do not know. Collins and Stevens referred to this as the students' model.
#Armed with the students' model, the teacher can then add information to facilitate and improve students understanding of what is known. This is determined by the level of sophistication of students' answers.
#Sub-goals are developed to diagnose and address students' errors and misconceptions.
#An agenda is developed prioritizing how students' errors and misconception well be address using the sub-goals developed.
Collins and Stevens (1977), as cited in Collins and Stevens (1981), have identified how priorities have been set by teachers. Priorities have been set based on the following:

Criticism of the Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching
Reigeluth (1983) has put forward the following criticisms about Cognitive Theory of Inquiry:
#He believes that the theory is not suitable for all kinds of content as proposed by Collins and Stevens (1981), who believed that the theory is domain independent and that it can be used to facilitate the development of rules and theories needed for deep understand of the domain. The theory, as he indicated, is more applicable to instruction involving the construction or understanding of rules, principles and theories. The theory may not be suitable for the teaching of facts or concept.
#He believes that the theory is not self-sufficient, in that it requires the use of other forms of instruction to facilitate the development students background information, which is critical to the discovery process proposed by Collins and Stevens (1981)
#The theory may not be efficient in specific rules and principle, particularly those involving algorithms, where an expository approach may be more efficient.

== Conclusion ==
The Collins and Stevens Cognitive Theory of Inquiry Teaching, despite the short coming identified by Reigeluth (1983), provides some strategies for teaching high-order thinking skills. Reigeluth (1983) also points out that the Collins and Stevens Cognitive Theory of Teaching provides some strategies for instruction that other theories have overlooked. Strategies such as considering alternative prediction, entrapping students, tracing consequences to a contradiction and questioning authority are invaluable skill in critical thinking. 
The focus of education today is to develop learners who are independent critical thinkers. There was once the belief that critical thinking skills could not be taught and that these skills develop naturally independent of instruction. The Collins and Stevens Cognitive Theory of Inquiry of Teaching indicate that learners can be taught strategies to develop and apply critical thinking skills.
Dewey (1938), as cited by McGregor (2007), pointed out that if students are provided with factual information without the cognitive skills that would enable them to understand, appreciate, transfer and connect ideas, the information gained would become meaningless in the future. It implies therefore, that instruction should seek to nurture the development of critical thinking skill.
Dewey (1910) as cited by McGregor (2007), has also indicated that there is a connection between thinking and learning. He posited that "thoughts involved in developing ideas and understandings are often assumed and implicated. To develop thoughtful learning these processes need to be more explicit and connected to the processes of coming to know and understand" (p. 47).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11255">'''Dendroarchaeology''' is a term used for the study of vegetation remains, old buildings, [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s, furniture, art and musical instruments using the techniques of [[dendrochronology]] ([[tree]]-ring dating). It refers to dendrochronological research of wood from the past regardless of its current physical context (in or above the soil). This form of dating is the most accurate and precise absolute dating method available to archaeologists, as the last ring that grew is the first year the tree could have been incorporated into an archaeological structure.&lt;ref name=Feder&gt;Feder K. Linking to the Past: A Brief Introduction to Archaeology. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Tree-ring dating is useful in that it can contribute to "chronometric", "environmental", and "behavioral" archaeological research.&lt;ref name="Nash S. E."&gt;Nash S. E. Archaeological Tree-Ring Dating at the Millennium. ''Journal of Archaeological Research'', Vol. 10, No. 3 (September 2002), pp. 243-275&lt;/ref&gt;

The utility of tree-ring dating in an environmental sense  is the most applicable of the three in today's world. Tree rings can be used to "reconstruct numerous environmental variables" such as "temperature", "precipitation", "stream flow", "drought society", "fire frequency and intensity", "insect infestation", "atmospheric circulation patterns", among others.&lt;ref name="Nash S. E."/&gt;

==History==
Tree ring laboratory scientists from Columbia University were some of the first to apply tree-ring dating to the colonial period, specifically architectural timbers in the eastern United States. For agencies like the National Park Service and other historical societies, Dr. Jacoby and Cook began dating historic structures in the lower Hudson River Valley, New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania. This was difficult at the time due to a lack of sufficiently long master dating chronology and access to suitable structures. Not until 1998 was a Boston area master dating chronology developed.
Today, the effectiveness of tree ring laboratory archaeological dating chronologies covers most of the area that was settled by the first European colonists. The numbers of these are in the hundreds and include historically significant structures such as Independence Hall and the Tuckahoe estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/tree-ring-laboratory/tree-ring-research/dendroarchaeology |title=Dendroarchaeology |year = 2012 | accessdate=April 12, 2012 |publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
There are two types of dates that can be assigned to tree specimens: ''cutting'' dates, and ''noncutting'' dates. Which date is assigned to a specimen is dependent on whether or not there is evidence that the last ring present on the specimen was the last ring the tree grew before it died.&lt;ref name="Nash S. E."/&gt;

''Cutting dates'' can be used for crossdated tree specimens that "possess evidence that the last ring present on the specimen was the last ring grown by the tree before it died." &lt;ref name="Nash S. E."/&gt;

''Noncutting dates'' are used for crossdated tree specimens "if there is no evidence indicating that the last ring present on the specimen is the last one grown before the tree died." &lt;ref name="Nash S. E."/&gt;
Patterns of tree growth will be similar between trees of the same species, growing in the same climate. These matching patterns align growth rings in different trees formed in the same year.  Once aligned, knowing the precise calendar year of any individual tree-ring is the same as knowing the calendar year of all the rings.  The goal of a dendroarchaeologist is to determine the year when the last ring was formed. 
Crossdating, the skill of finding matching ring-width patterns between tree-ring samples, is used to assign the precise calendar year to every ring. This is affected by the climate that the timber was in. It is also important to have enough rings to actually confirm a date. Once the rings are dates, the chronology is measured. The last step is to compare the rings with that of ring-width patterns in sampled timbers and a master dating chronology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/tree-ring-laboratory/tree-ring-research/dendroarchaeology/methodology|title=Scientific Application |year = 2012 | accessdate=April 12, 2012 |publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For trees to be useful in archaeological analysis, they must "produce annual growth rings that are uniform around the tree stem", they must "live for decades and, preferably, centuries" and they "must have been used extensively by humans either for habitation or fuel." &lt;ref name="Nash S. E."/&gt; One of the problems with this evaluation is that it is possible under certain conditions for a tree to miss a growth-ring or produce two growth rings in a season. During extreme drought there can be insufficient growth of xylem to form a noticeable ring. Alternatively, if a defoliating agent (e.g. drought, late frost, or insect damage) can arrest the growth of a tree early in a year, after which there is a secondary growth period of new foliage causing two rings to form.&lt;ref name=Baillie&gt;{{cite book|last=Baillie|first=M.G.L.|title=Tree-Ring Dating and Archaeology|year=1982|publisher=Croom Helm Ltd|location=London|isbn=0-7099-0613-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another difficulty in the use of tree-ring dating as applied to archaeology is the variety and condition of wood used in construction of archaeological sites. Many such samples are encountered wet. Heartwood can normally retain much of its substance and can be dried out and polished for analysis. On the other hand, ancient wet sapwood samples seldom survive drying out. As a result, the sapwood should either be measured wet and then allowed to dry, or it should be frozen or kept wet.&lt;ref name=Baillie /&gt;

In North America, "millennial-length chronologies have been developed for two species of bristlecone pine (''Pinus longaeva'' in the Great Basin and ''Pinus aristata'' in the Rocky Mountains), bald cypress (''Taxodium distichum''), coast redwood (''Sequoia sempervirens''), Douglas-fir (''Pseudotsuga menziesii''), eastern cedar (''Juniperus virginiana''), juniper (''Juniperus sp.''), Larch (''Larix sp.''), lodgepole pine (''Pinus contorta''), limber pine (''Pinus flexilis''), mountain hemlock (''Tsuga mertensiana''), ponderosa pine (''Pinus ponderosa''), and giant sequoia (''Sequoiadendron giganteum'') (Jacoby, 2000a).” &lt;ref name="Nash S. E."/&gt;

“In the southern hemisphere, successful crossdating has been achieved on alerce (''Fitroya cupressoides'') and pehuen (''Araucaria araucana''), also known as 'Chilean pine' or the 'monkey puzzle tree,' specimens in South America, kauri (''Agathis australis'') specimens in New Zealand, clanwilliam cedar (''Widdringtonia cedarbergensis'') specimens in Australia and Tasmania, and huon pine (''Lagarostrobus franklinii'') in Tasmania (Jacoby, 2000al; Norton, 1990).” &lt;ref name="Nash S. E."/&gt;

==Application==
The main application of tree research laboratory science or dendroarchaeology is to produce records of past climates that might be unavailable otherwise.  Timber remains give insight into what little remains of our national forests prior to colonial settlement. This also benefits the sciences of paleoclimatology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/tree-ring-laboratory/tree-ring-research/dendroarchaeology/scientific-application|title=Scientific Application |year = 2012 | accessdate=April 12, 2012 |publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dendrochronological dating is potentially applicable wherever trees were growing, except in tropical regions. For use in absolute dating of archaeological sites, it is partially limited by the availability of a master reference chronology for the region concerned. If there is a gap in the chronology (e.g. the inability to use a chronology constructed from pine samples in the British Isle prior to the 17th century due to the lack of use of pine in architecture then) then absolute dating cannot be applied.&lt;ref name=Baillie /&gt; Additionally, non-climatic influences can also affect the tree-ring pattern of timber samples. Even if a reference chronology is available, care must be taken to identify aberrations in the ring pattern to determine if the sample is usable for dating.&lt;ref name=Aitken&gt;{{cite book|last=Aitken|first=M.J.|title=Science-based Dating in Archaeology|year=1990|publisher=Longman Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-582-05498-2|pages=37–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dendroarchaeology has been used extensively in the dating of historical buildings. After cross-matching the chronology from the building with the chronology of living trees, it is immediately possible to figure out the dates at which the historic timbers used in construction were felled. Similarly, if an extended chronology is available, then dating of samples from buildings of known or unknown date is possible. However, a limiting aspect of this application becomes apparent when dating medieval buildings. In such buildings, many timber samples lack completeness out to the underbark surface which can make the task of determining the felling year much more difficult.&lt;ref name=Goksu&gt;{{cite book|last=Gӧksu|first=H.Y.|title=Scientific Dating Methods|year=1991|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Luxembourg|isbn=0-7923-1461-1|pages=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of dendroarchaeology in uncovering past trade patterns also becomes possible as chronology records for timber around the world become more complete and accessible. Patterns from individual samples will match much more closely with their native chronologies than with their regional chronology. For example, strong cross dating is found between Irish and English chronologies, but individual ring patterns tend to match better against their local chronologies. Hence, this strong geographical component of tree ring chronologies can be used to source timber samples at archaeological sites to uncover trade routes required for the site construction.&lt;ref name=Goksu /&gt;

Dendrochronology can also be used in concert with [[radiocarbon dating]] to allow for more accurate date measurements using radiocarbon dating on archaeological sites. It is known that the concentration of carbon-14 in the atmosphere is not constant. By performing radiocarbon dating on timber samples in a known chronology, radiocarbon dates can be plotted against real time generating a calibration curve that can be used for future radiocarbon samples.&lt;ref name=Baillie /&gt;

While dendrochronology is often considered as an absolute dating method, it can also be used as a powerful tool in the relative dating of an archaeological site. Timber samples may be able to be compared with others on the site to help construct a timeline of events for that particular site. Such samples can also be used to settle issues in constructing a chronological [[Typology (archaeology)|typology]] for artifacts found on site. The important point is that such within-site analysis can be done whether or not a chronology is available to date the whole assemblage.&lt;ref name=Baillie /&gt;

{{Geodesy}}
'''Earth radius''' is the distance from a selected center of Earth to a point on its surface,  which is often chosen to be sea level, or more commonly, the surface of an idealized ellipsoid representing the shape of Earth. Because Earth is not a perfect sphere, the determination of Earth's radius can have several values, depending on how it is measured; from its equatorial radius of about {{convert|6378|km|mi|abbr=off}} to its polar radius of about {{convert|6357|km|mi|abbr=off}}. 

When only one radius is stated, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) prefers that it be Earth's equatorial radius.&lt;ref name="IAU XXIX" /&gt;  

The [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics]] (IUGG) gives three global average radii, the arithmetic mean of the radii of the ellipsoid (R{{sub|1}}), the radius of a sphere with the same surface area as the ellipsoid or authalic radius (R{{sub|2}}), and the radius of a sphere with the same volume as the ellipsoid (R{{sub|3}}).&lt;ref name="Moritz" /&gt; All three IUGG average radii are about {{convert|6371|km|mi}}. A fourth global average radius not mentioned by the IUGG is the rectifying radius, the radius of a sphere with a circumference equal to the perimeter of the polar cross section of the ellipsoid, about {{convert|6367|km|mi}}. The radius of curvature at any point on the surface of the ellipsoid depends on its coordinates and its azimuth, north-south (meridional), east-west (prime vertical), or somewhere in between. 

==Introduction==
[[File:Earth_oblateness_to_scale.svg|thumb|300px|A scale diagram of the [[Flattening|oblateness]] of the 2003 [[IERS]] [[reference ellipsoid]]. The outer edge of the dark blue line is an [[ellipse]] with the same [[Eccentricity (mathematics)#Ellipses|eccentricity]] as that of Earth, with north at the top. For comparison, the light blue circle within has a diameter equal to the ellipse's [[minor axis]]. The red line represents the [[Karman line]] {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]], while the yellow area denotes the [[apsis|altitude]] range of the [[International Space Station|ISS]] in [[low Earth orbit]].]]
{{main|Figure of the Earth|Earth ellipsoid|Reference ellipsoid}}

[[Earth's rotation]], internal density variations, and external [[tidal force]]s cause its shape to deviate systematically from a perfect sphere.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;For details see [[figure of the Earth]], [[geoid]], and [[Earth tide]].&lt;/ref&gt; Local [[topography]] increases the variance, resulting in a surface of profound complexity. Our descriptions of Earth's surface must be simpler than reality in order to be tractable. Hence, we create models to approximate characteristics of Earth's surface, generally relying on the simplest model that suits the need.

Each of the models in common use involve some notion of the geometric [[radius]]. Strictly speaking, spheres are the only solids to have radii, but broader uses of the term ''radius'' are common in many fields, including those dealing with models of Earth. The following is a partial list of models of Earth's surface, ordered from exact to more approximate:
* The actual surface of Earth
* The [[geoid]], defined by [[mean sea level]] at each point on the real surface&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;There is no single center to the geoid; it varies according to local [[Geodetic system|geodetic]] conditions.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[spheroid]], also called an [[ellipsoid]] of revolution, [[Geodetic system#Geodetic versus geocentric latitude|geocentric]] to model the entire Earth, or else [[Geodetic system#Geodetic versus geocentric latitude|geodetic]] for regional work&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;In a geocentric ellipsoid, the center of the ellipsoid coincides with some computed center of Earth, and best models the earth as a whole. Geodetic ellipsoids are better suited to regional idiosyncrasies of the geoid. A partial surface of an ellipsoid gets fitted to the region, in which case the center and orientation of the ellipsoid generally do not coincide with the earth's center of mass or axis of rotation.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[sphere]]

In the case of the geoid and ellipsoids, the fixed distance from any point on the model to the specified center is called ''"a radius of the Earth"'' or ''"the radius of the Earth at that point"''.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The value of the radius is completely dependent upon the latitude in the case of an ellipsoid model, and nearly so on the geoid.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also common to refer to any ''[[#Mean radii|mean radius]]'' of a spherical model as ''"the radius of the earth"''. When considering the Earth's real surface, on the other hand, it is uncommon to refer to a "radius", since there is generally no practical need. Rather, elevation above or below sea level is useful.

Regardless of the model, any radius falls between the polar minimum of about 6,357&amp;nbsp;km and the equatorial maximum of about 6,378&amp;nbsp;km (3,950 to 3,963&amp;nbsp;mi). Hence, the Earth deviates from a perfect sphere by only a third of a percent, which supports the spherical model in many contexts and justifies the term "radius of the Earth". While specific values differ, the concepts in this article generalize to any major [[planet]].

===Physics of Earth's deformation===
Rotation of a planet causes it to approximate an ''[[spheroid|oblate ellipsoid]]/spheroid'' with a bulge at the [[equator]] and flattening at the [[North Pole|North]] and [[South Pole]]s, so that the ''equatorial radius'' {{mvar|a}} is larger than the ''polar radius'' {{mvar|b}} by approximately {{mvar|aq}}. The ''oblateness constant'' {{mvar|q}} is given by
:&lt;math&gt;q=\frac{a^3 \omega^2}{GM}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|ω}} is the [[angular frequency]], {{mvar|G}} is the [[gravitational constant]], and {{mvar|M}} is the mass of the planet.{{refn|This follows from the [[International Astronomical Union]] [[2006 definition of planet|definition]] rule (2): a planet assumes a shape due to [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] where [[gravity]] and [[centrifugal force]]s are nearly balanced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0603/index.html IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU Resolution votes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107022302/http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0603/index.html |date=2006-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} For the Earth {{math|{{sfrac|1|''q''}} ≈ 289}}, which is close to the measured inverse [[flattening]] {{math|{{sfrac|1|''f''}} ≈ 298.257}}. Additionally, the bulge at the equator shows slow variations. The bulge had been decreasing, but since 1998 the bulge has increased, possibly due to redistribution of ocean mass via currents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/20020801gravityfield.html Satellites Reveal A Mystery Of Large Change In Earth's Gravity Field ], Aug. 1, 2002, [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428205036/http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/20020801gravityfield.html |date=April 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Lowresgeoidheight.jpg|400px|right]]
The variation in [[density]] and [[Crust (geology)|crustal]] thickness causes gravity to vary across the surface and in time, so that the mean sea level differs from the ellipsoid. This difference is the ''[[geoid]] height'', positive above or outside the ellipsoid, negative below or inside. The geoid height variation is under {{convert|110|m|ft|abbr=on}} on Earth. The geoid height can change abruptly due to earthquakes (such as the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|Sumatra-Andaman earthquake]]) or reduction in ice masses (such as [[Greenland]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=18567 NASA's Grace Finds Greenland Melting Faster, 'Sees' Sumatra Quake], December 20, 2005, [[Goddard Space Flight Center]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all deformations originate within the Earth. The gravity of the Moon and Sun cause the Earth's surface at a given point to undulate by tenths of meters over a nearly 12-hour period (see [[Earth tide]]).

===Radius and local conditions===
[[File:Abu Reyhan Biruni-Earth Circumference.svg|thumb|[[Al-Biruni#Geodesy and geography|Al-Biruni]]'s (973–1048) method for calculation of the Earth's radius improved accuracy.]]
Given local and transient influences on surface height, the values defined below are based on a "general purpose" model, refined as globally precisely as possible within {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} of reference ellipsoid height, and to within {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} of mean sea level (neglecting geoid height).

Additionally, the radius can be estimated from the curvature of the Earth at a point. Like a [[torus]], the curvature at a point will be greatest (tightest) in one direction (north–south on Earth) and smallest (flattest) perpendicularly (east–west). The corresponding [[Radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]] depends on the location and direction of measurement from that point. A consequence is that a distance to the [[horizon|true horizon]] at the equator is slightly shorter in the north/south direction than in the east-west direction.

In summary, local variations in terrain prevent defining a single "precise" radius. One can only adopt an idealized model. Since the estimate by [[Eratosthenes]], many models have been created. Historically, these models were based on regional topography, giving the best [[Figure of the Earth#Historical Earth ellipsoids|reference ellipsoid]] for the area under survey. As satellite remote sensing and especially the [[Global Positioning System]] gained importance, true global models were developed which, while not as accurate for regional work, best approximate the Earth as a whole.

==Fixed radius==
The following radii are fixed and do not include a variable location dependence. They are derived from the [[World Geodetic System]] 1984 ([[WGS-84]]) standard ellipsoid.&lt;ref name=tr8350_2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tr8350.2/wgs84fin.pdf |title=WGS84RPT.tif:Corel PHOTO-PAINT |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value for the equatorial radius is defined to the nearest 0.1&amp;nbsp;m in WGS-84. The value for the polar radius in this section has been rounded to the nearest 0.1&amp;nbsp;m, which is expected to be adequate for most uses. Refer to the WGS-84 ellipsoid if a more precise value for its polar radius is needed.

The radii in this section are for an idealized surface. Even the idealized radii have an uncertainty of ±2&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tr8350.2/tr8350.2-a/Chapter%203.pdf |title=Info |website=earth-info.nga.mil |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discrepancy between the ellipsoid radius and the radius to a physical location may be significant. When identifying the position of an observable location, the use of more precise values for WGS-84 radii may not yield a corresponding improvement in [[accuracy]].

The symbol given for the named radius is used in the formulae found in this article.

===Equatorial radius===
The Earth's equatorial radius {{mvar|a}}, or [[semi-major axis]], is the distance from its center to the [[equator]] and equals {{convert|6378.1370|km|mi|sigfig=8|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maia.usno.navy.mil/NSFA/NSFA_cbe.html#EarthRadius2009|title=Equatorial Radius of the Earth|last=|first=|date=2012|website=Numerical Standards for Fundamental Astronomy: Astronomical Constants : Current Best Estimates (CBEs)|publisher=IAU Division I Working Group|access-date=2016-08-10|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equatorial radius is often used to compare Earth with other [[Planet#Attributes|planets]].

===Polar radius===
The Earth's polar radius {{mvar|b}}, or [[semi-minor axis]], is the distance from its center to the North and South Poles, and equals {{convert|6356.7523|km|mi|sigfig=8|abbr=on}}.

==Location-dependent radii{{anchor|Radii with location dependence}}==

===Geocentric radius===
The distance from the Earth's center to a point on the spheroid surface at geodetic latitude {{mvar|φ}} is:

:&lt;math&gt;R(\varphi)=\sqrt{\frac{(a^2\cos\varphi)^2+(b^2\sin\varphi)^2}{(a\cos\varphi)^2+(b\sin\varphi)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are, respectively, the equatorial radius and the polar radius.

====Geophysical extremes====
* '''Maximum:''' The summit of [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] is {{convert|6384.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Earth's center.
* '''Minimum:''' The floor of the [[Arctic Ocean]] is approximately {{convert|6,352.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Earth's center.&lt;ref name=extrema&gt;{{cite web |url=http://guam.discover-theworld.com/Country_Guide.aspx?id=96&amp;entry=Mariana+Trench |title=Discover-TheWorld.com - Guam - POINTS OF INTEREST - Don't Miss - Mariana Trench |publisher=Guam.discover-theworld.com |date=1960-01-23 |accessdate=2013-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910021956/http://guam.discover-theworld.com/Country_Guide.aspx?id=96&amp;entry=Mariana+Trench |archivedate=2012-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radii of curvature{{anchor|Curvature}}===
{{see also|Spheroid#Curvature}}

====Principal sections====
There are two [[Principal curvature|principal radii of curvature]]: along the meridional and prime-vertical [[normal section]]s.

=====Meridional=====
In particular, the Earth's ''radius of curvature in the (north–south) [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]'' at {{mvar|φ}} is:
:&lt;math&gt;M(\varphi)=\frac{(ab)^2}{\big((a\cos\varphi)^2+(b\sin\varphi)^2\big)^\frac32}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
This is the radius that [[Eratosthenes#Measurement of the Earth|Eratosthenes]] measured.

=====Prime vertical=====
If one point had appeared due east of the other, one finds the approximate curvature in the east–west direction.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=curvprim&gt;East–west directions can be misleading. Point B, which appears due east from A, will be closer to the equator than A. Thus the curvature found this way is smaller than the curvature of a circle of constant latitude, except at the equator. West can be exchanged for east in this discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

This ''radius of curvature in the [[prime vertical]]'' which is perpendicular (normal or [[orthogonal]]) to {{mvar|M}} at geodetic latitude {{mvar|φ}} is:&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;{{mvar|N}} is defined as the radius of curvature in the plane that is normal to both the surface of the ellipsoid at, and the meridian passing through, the specific point of interest.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;N(\varphi)=\frac{a^2}{\sqrt{(a\cos\varphi)^2+(b\sin\varphi)^2}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
This radius is also called the '''transverse radius of curvature'''. At the equator, {{math|''N'' {{=}} ''R''}}.

[[Image:EarthEllipRadii.jpg|445x445px|Three different radii as a function of Earth's latitude. {{mvar|R}} is the geocentric radius; {{mvar|M}} is the meridional radius of curvature; and {{mvar|N}} is the prime vertical radius of curvature.|frame]]

The Earth's meridional radius of curvature at the equator equals the meridian's [[semi-latus rectum]]:

:{{math|{{sfrac|''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|''a''}}}}{{pad|1em}}={{pad|1em}}6,335.439&amp;nbsp;km

The Earth's polar radius of curvature is:
:{{math|{{sfrac|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|''b''}}}}{{pad|1em}}={{pad|1em}}6,399.594&amp;nbsp;km

====Directional====
The Earth's radius of curvature along a course at an [[azimuth]] (measured clockwise from north) {{mvar|α}} at {{mvar|φ}} is derived from [[Euler's theorem (differential geometry)|Euler's curvature formula]] as follows:&lt;ref name=Torge/&gt;{{rp|97}}
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{c}=\frac{1}{\dfrac{\cos^2\alpha}{M}+\dfrac{\sin^2\alpha}{N}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

====Combinations====
It is possible to combine the principal radii of curvature above in a non-directional manner.

{{anchor|Gaussian}}{{anchor|Gaussian radius of curvature}}The Earth's [[Gaussian curvature|Gaussian radius of curvature]] at latitude {{mvar|φ}} is:&lt;ref name=Torge&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFO6VB_czRYC&amp;pg=PA98 |title=Geodesy|work=google.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{a}=\sqrt{MN}=\frac{a^2b}{(a\cos\varphi)^2+(b\sin\varphi)^2}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

{{anchor|Mean radius of curvature}}The Earth's [[Mean curvature|mean radius of curvature]] at latitude {{mvar|φ}} is:&lt;ref name=Torge /&gt;{{rp|97}}
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{m}=\frac{2}{\dfrac{1}{M}+\dfrac{1}{N}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Global average radii{{anchor|Mean radii}}==
The Earth can be modeled as a sphere in many ways. This section describes the common ways. The various radii derived here use the notation and dimensions noted above for the Earth as derived from the [[WGS-84]] ellipsoid;&lt;ref name=tr8350_2 /&gt; namely,

:{{mvar|a}} = Equatorial radius ({{val|6378.1370|u=km}})
:{{mvar|b}} = Polar radius ({{val|6356.7523|u=km}})

A sphere being a gross approximation of the spheroid, which itself is an approximation of the geoid, units are given here in kilometers rather than the millimeter resolution appropriate for geodesy.

===Mean radius===
[[File:WGS84_mean_Earth_radius.svg|thumb|Equatorial (''a''), polar (''b'') and mean Earth radii as defined in the 1984 [[World Geodetic System]] revision (not to scale)]]
In geophysics, the [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics]] (IUGG) defines the mean radius (denoted {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}) to be&lt;ref name="Moritz"&gt;Moritz, H. (1980). [ftp://athena.fsv.cvut.cz/ZFG/grs80-Moritz.pdf ''Geodetic Reference System 1980''], by resolution of the XVII General Assembly of the IUGG in Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_1 = \frac{2a+b}{3}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
For Earth, the mean radius is {{convert|6371.0088|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Moritz2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moritz |first=H. |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=March 2000 |title=Geodetic Reference System 1980 |journal=Journal of Geodesy |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=128–133 |doi=10.1007/s001900050278 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/0bgccvjj5bedgdfu/about/ |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode = 2000JGeod..74..128. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In astronomy, the [[International Astronomical Union]] denotes the ''nominal equatorial Earth radius'' as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}^\mathrm N_\mathrm{eE}&lt;/math&gt;, which is defined to be {{convert|6378.1|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name = "IAU XXIX"/&gt;{{rp|3}} The ''nominal polar Earth radius'' is defined as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}^\mathrm N_\mathrm{pE}&lt;/math&gt; = {{convert|6356.8|km|mi|abbr=on}}. These values correspond to the zero tide radii. Equatorial radius is conventionally used as the nominal value unless the polar radius is explicitly required.&lt;ref name = "IAU XXIX"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

===Authalic radius===
{{see also|Authalic latitude}}
Earth's authalic ("equal area") radius is the radius of a hypothetical perfect sphere that has the same surface area as the [[reference ellipsoid]]. The [[IUGG]] denotes the authalic radius as {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="Moritz"/&gt;

A closed-form solution exists for a spheroid:&lt;ref name="Snyder manual"&gt;Snyder, J.P. (1987). ''Map Projections – A Working Manual (US Geological Survey Professional Paper 1395)'' p. 16–17. Washington D.C: United States Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_2=\sqrt{\frac{a^2+\frac{ab^2}{\sqrt{a^2-b^2}}\ln{\left(\frac{a+\sqrt{a^2-b^2}}b\right)}}{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{a^2}2+\frac{b^2}2\frac{\tanh^{-1}e}e} =\sqrt{\frac{A}{4\pi}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} and {{mvar|A}} is the surface area of the spheroid.

For the Earth, the authalic radius is {{convert|6,371.0072|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Moritz2000/&gt;

===Volumetric radius===
Another spherical model is defined by the volumetric radius, which is the radius of a sphere of volume equal to the ellipsoid. The [[IUGG]] denotes the volumetric radius as {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="Moritz"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_3=\sqrt[3]{a^2b}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
For Earth, the volumetric radius equals {{convert|6,371.0008|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Moritz2000/&gt;

===Rectifying radius===
{{see also|Meridian arc#Polar distance|Rectifying latitude}}
Another mean radius is the ''rectifying radius'', giving a sphere with circumference equal to the [[circumference|perimeter]] of the ellipse described by any polar cross section of the ellipsoid. This requires an [[Circumference#Ellipse|elliptic integral]] to find, given the polar and equatorial radii:
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{r}=\frac{2}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\sqrt{{a^2}\cos^2\varphi + {b^2} \sin^2\varphi}\,d\varphi\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The rectifying radius is equivalent to the meridional mean, which is defined as the average value of {{mvar|M}}:&lt;ref name="Snyder manual"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{r}=\frac{2}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\!M(\varphi)\,d\varphi\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For integration limits of [0,{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}], the integrals for rectifying radius and mean radius evaluate to the same result, which, for Earth, amounts to {{convert|6,367.4491|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

The meridional mean is well approximated by the semicubic mean of the two axes,
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{r}\approx\left(\frac{a^\frac32+b^\frac32}{2}\right)^\frac23\,,&lt;/math&gt;

which differs from the exact result by less than {{convert|1|um|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}; the mean of the two axes,
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{r}\approx\frac{a+b}{2}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

about {{convert|6,367.445|km|mi|abbr=on}}, can also be used.

===Average distance from center to surface===
Most global mean radii are based on the [[reference ellipsoid]], which approximates the geoid. The geoid has no direct relationship with surface topography, however. An alternative calculation averages elevations everywhere, resulting in a mean radius {{val|230|u=m}} larger than the [[Earth radius#Mean radius|IUGG mean radius]], the [[Authalic radius|authalic radius]], or the [[Earth radius#Volumetric radius|volumetric radius]]. This average is {{convert|6371.230|km|mi|abbr=on}} with uncertainty of {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="chambat"&gt;{{cite article

==Osculating sphere==
The best local spherical approximation to the ellipsoid in the vicinity of a given point is the [[osculating circle|osculating]] sphere. Its radius equals the Gaussian radius of curvature as above, and its radial direction coincides with the ellipsoid [[normal direction]]. The center of the osculating sphere is offset from the center of the ellipsoid, but is at the [[center of curvature]] for the given point on the ellipsoid surface. This concept aids the interpretation of terrestrial and planetary [[radio occultation]] [[refraction]] measurements and in some navigation and surveillance applications.{{fact|date=December 2018}}

An '''ecosystem''' is a [[community (ecology)|community]] made up of living organisms and [[abiotic component|nonliving components]] such as air, water, and mineral soil.&lt;ref&gt;Tansley (1934); Molles (1999), p. 482; Chapin ''et al''.

They can be thought of as interdependent collections of plants and animals, or as structured systems and communities governed by general rules.&lt;ref name="Sagoff2003" /&gt; The living ([[Biotic component|biotic]]) and non-living ([[abiotic component|abiotic]]) components interact through [[nutrient cycles]] and energy flows.&lt;ref name="Odum1971"&gt;{{cite book |last=Odum |first=Eugene P |date=1971 |title=Fundamentals of Ecology |edition=third |publisher=Saunders |location=New York |isbn=0-53442-066-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystems include interactions among organisms, and between organisms and their environment.&lt;ref name = Schulze400&gt;Schulze ''et al''.

Energy, water, [[nitrogen]] and soil minerals are essential abiotic components of an ecosystem. The energy used by ecosystems comes primarily from the [[sun]], via [[photosynthesis]]. Photosynthesis uses energy from the sun and also captures [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere. [[Animal]]s also play an important role in the movement of matter and energy through ecosystems. They influence the amount of plant and [[microbe|microbial]] [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] that lives in the system. As organic matter dies, carbon is released back into the atmosphere. This process also facilitates [[nutrient cycling]] by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form that can be used again by plants and other microbes.&lt;ref name="Chapin10"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ecosystems are controlled by both external and internal factors. External factors such as [[climate]], the [[parent material]] that forms the soil, [[topography]] and time each affect ecosystems. However, these external factors are not themselves influenced by the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Chapin11"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 11–13&lt;/ref&gt;  Ecosystems are dynamic: they are subject to periodic disturbances and are often in the process of recovering from past [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbances]] and seeking balance.&lt;ref name="Chapin281" /&gt; Internal factors are different: They not only control ecosystem processes but are also controlled by them. Another way of saying this is that internal factors are subject to [[feedback|feedback loops]].&lt;ref name="Chapin11" /&gt;

[[Human]]s operate within ecosystems and can influence both internal and external factors.&lt;ref name="Chapin11" /&gt; [[Global warming]] is an alleged example of a cumulative effect of human activities. Ecosystems provide benefits, called "[[ecosystem services]]", which people depend on for their [[livelihood]]. [[Ecosystem management]] is more efficient than trying to manage individual [[species]].{{TOC limit|3}}

There is no single definition of what constitutes an ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Sagoff2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sagoff|first=Mark|year=2003|title=The plaza and the pendulum: Two concepts of ecological science|journal=Biology and Philosophy|volume=18|issue=4|pages=529–552|doi=10.1023/A:1025566804906}}&lt;/ref&gt; German ecologist Ernst-Detlef Schulze and coauthors defined an ecosystem as an area which is "uniform regarding the biological turnover, and contains all the fluxes above and below the ground area under consideration." They explicitly reject [[Gene Likens]]' use of entire [[Drainage basin|river catchments]] as "too wide a demarcation" to be a single ecosystem, given the level of heterogeneity within such an area.&lt;ref name="Schulze399"&gt;Schulze ''et al''. 300–402&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have suggested that an ecosystem can encompass a much larger area, even the whole planet.&lt;ref name="planet" /&gt; Schulze and coauthors also rejected the idea that a single rotting log could be studied as an ecosystem because the size of the flows between the log and its surroundings are too large, relative to the proportion cycles within the log.&lt;ref name="Schulze399" /&gt; Philosopher of science Mark Sagoff considers the failure to define "the kind of object it studies" to be an obstacle to the development of theory in [[ecosystem ecology]].&lt;ref name="Sagoff2003" /&gt;

Ecosystems can be studied in a variety of ways. Those include theoretical studies or more practical studies that monitor specific ecosystems over long periods of time or look at differences between ecosystems to better understand how they work. Some studies involve experimenting with direct manipulation of the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Carpenter1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=Stephen R.|author2=Jonathan J. Cole|author3=Timothy E.

===Related concepts===

T[[terrestrial ecosystem|errestrial ecosystem]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (found on land) and [[aquatic ecosystems]] (found in water) are concepts related to ecosystems. Aquatic ecosystems are split into [[marine ecosystem]]s and [[freshwater ecosystem]]s.

=== External and internal factors ===
Ecosystems are controlled both by external and internal factors. External factors, also called state factors, control the overall structure of an ecosystem and the way things work within it, but are not themselves influenced by the ecosystem. The most important of these is [[climate]].&lt;ref name="Chapin11"/&gt; Climate determines the [[biome]] in which the ecosystem is embedded. Rainfall patterns and seasonal temperatures influence photosynthesis and thereby determine the amount of water and energy available to the ecosystem.&lt;ref name = "Chapin11"/&gt; 

[[Parent material]] determines the nature of the soil in an ecosystem, and influences the supply of mineral nutrients. [[Topography]] also controls ecosystem processes by affecting things like [[microclimate]], soil development and the movement of water through a system. For example, ecosystems can be quite different if situated in a small depression on the landscape, versus one present on an adjacent steep hillside.&lt;ref name="Chapin11" /&gt;

Other external factors that play an important role in ecosystem functioning include time and potential [[biota (ecology)|biota]]. Similarly, the set of organisms that can potentially be present in an area can also significantly affect ecosystems. Ecosystems in similar environments that are located in different parts of the world can end up doing things very differently simply because they have different pools of species present.&lt;ref name="Chapin11" /&gt; The [[introduced species|introduction of non-native species]] can cause substantial shifts in ecosystem function.

Unlike external factors, internal factors in ecosystems not only control ecosystem processes but are also controlled by them. Consequently, they are often subject to [[feedback|feedback loops]].&lt;ref name = "Chapin11"/&gt; While the [[Resource (biology)|resource]] inputs are generally controlled by external processes like climate and parent material, the availability of these resources within the ecosystem is controlled by internal factors like decomposition, root competition or shading.&lt;ref name = "Chapin11"/&gt; Other factors like disturbance, succession or the types of species present are also internal factors. 

===Primary production===
[[File:Seawifs global biosphere.jpg|upright=1.8|thumb|Global oceanic and terrestrial [[phototroph]] abundance, from September 1997 to August 2000. As an estimate of [[autotroph]] biomass, it is only a rough indicator of primary production potential and not an actual estimate of it.]]
{{main article|Primary production}}
Primary production is the production of [[organic matter]] from inorganic carbon sources. This mainly occurs through [[photosynthesis]]. The energy incorporated through this process supports life on earth, while the carbon makes up much of the organic matter in living and dead biomass, [[soil carbon]] and [[fossil fuel]]s. It also drives the [[carbon cycle]], which influences global [[climate]] via the [[greenhouse effect]].

Through the process of photosynthesis, plants capture energy from light and use it to combine [[carbon dioxide]] and water to produce [[carbohydrate]]s and [[oxygen]]. The photosynthesis carried out by all the plants in an ecosystem is called the gross primary production (GPP).&lt;ref name = "Chapin97"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 97–104&lt;/ref&gt; About 48–60% of the GPP is consumed in plant respiration. 

The remainder, that portion of GPP that is not used up by respiration, is known as the [[net primary production]] (NPP).&lt;ref name="Chapin123"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 123–150&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Energy flow===

{{main article|Energy flow (ecology)}}
{{See also|Food web|Trophic level}}
[[Energy]] and [[carbon]] enter ecosystems through [[photosynthesis]], are incorporated into living tissue, transferred to other organisms that feed on the living and dead plant matter, and eventually released through respiration.&lt;ref name="Chapin123" /&gt;

The carbon and energy incorporated into plant tissues (net primary production) is either consumed by animals while the plant is alive, or it remains uneaten when the plant tissue dies and becomes [[detritus]]. In [[terrestrial ecosystem]]s, roughly 90% of the net primary production ends up being broken down by [[decomposition|decomposers]]. The remainder is either consumed by animals while still alive and enters the plant-based trophic system, or it is consumed after it has died, and enters the detritus-based trophic system. 

In [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic systems]], the proportion of plant biomass that gets consumed by [[herbivore]]s is much higher.&lt;ref name="Chapin244"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002) pp. 244–264&lt;/ref&gt;
In trophic systems photosynthetic organisms are the primary producers. The organisms that consume their tissues are called primary consumers or [[secondary production|secondary producers]]—[[herbivores]]. Organisms which feed on [[microbe]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]) are termed [[microbivore]]s. Animals that feed on primary consumers—[[carnivore]]s—are secondary consumers. Each of these constitutes a [[trophic level]].&lt;ref name="Chapin244" /&gt; 

The sequence of consumption—from plant to herbivore, to carnivore—forms a [[food chain]]. Real systems are much more complex than this—organisms will generally feed on more than one form of food, and may feed at more than one trophic level. Carnivores may capture some prey which are part of a plant-based trophic system and others that are part of a detritus-based trophic system (a bird that feeds both on herbivorous grasshoppers and earthworms, which consume detritus). Real systems, with all these complexities, form [[food web]]s rather than food chains.&lt;ref name="Chapin244" /&gt;

====Ecosystem ecology====
{{Main article|Ecosystem ecology}}
{{See also|Ecosystem model}}
[[File:East Scotia Ridge - Plos Biol 04.tif|thumb|right|A [[hydrothermal vent]] is an ecosystem on the ocean floor. (The scale bar is 1 m.)]]
Ecosystem ecology studies "the flow of energy and materials through organisms and the physical environment". It seeks to understand the processes which govern the stocks of material and energy in ecosystems, and the flow of matter and energy through them. The study of ecosystems can cover 10 [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]], from the surface layers of rocks to the surface of the planet.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 3–7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decomposition===
{{See also|Decomposition}}
The carbon and nutrients in [[soil organic matter|dead organic matter]] are broken down by a group of processes known as [[decomposition]]. This releases nutrients that can then be re-used for plant and microbial production and returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere (or water) where it can be used for [[photosynthesis]]. In the absence of decomposition, the dead organic matter would accumulate in an ecosystem, and nutrients and atmospheric carbon dioxide would be depleted.&lt;ref name= Chapin151&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 151–157&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 90% of terrestrial net primary production goes directly from plant to decomposer.&lt;ref name = "Chapin244"/&gt;

Decomposition processes can be separated into three categories—[[leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], fragmentation and chemical alteration of dead material. 

==== Leaching ====
As water moves through dead organic matter, it dissolves and carries with it the water-soluble components. These are then taken up by organisms in the soil, react with mineral soil, or are transported beyond the confines of the ecosystem (and are considered lost to it).&lt;ref name="Chapin151" /&gt; Newly shed leaves and newly dead animals have high concentrations of water-soluble components and include [[sugar]]s, [[amino acid]]s and mineral nutrients. Leaching is more important in wet environments and much less important in dry ones.&lt;ref name="Chapin151" /&gt;

==== Fragmentation ====
Fragmentation processes break organic material into smaller pieces, exposing new surfaces for colonization by microbes. Freshly shed [[leaf litter]] may be inaccessible due to an outer layer of [[plant cuticle|cuticle]] or [[Bark (botany)|bark]], and [[protoplasm|cell contents]] are protected by a [[cell wall]]. Newly dead animals may be covered by an [[exoskeleton]]. Fragmentation processes, which break through these protective layers, accelerate the rate of microbial decomposition.&lt;ref name= Chapin151/&gt; Animals fragment detritus as they hunt for food, as does passage through the gut. [[Freeze-thaw cycle]]s and cycles of wetting and drying also fragment dead material.&lt;ref name= Chapin151/&gt;

==== Chemical alteration ====
The chemical alteration of the dead organic matter is primarily achieved through bacterial and fungal action. Fungal [[hypha]]e produce enzymes which can break through the tough outer structures surrounding dead plant material. They also produce enzymes which break down [[lignin]], which allows them access to both cell contents and to the nitrogen in the lignin. Fungi can transfer carbon and nitrogen through their hyphal networks and thus, unlike bacteria, are not dependent solely on locally available resources.&lt;ref name = "Chapin151"/&gt;

==== Decomposition rates ====
{{Further|Decomposition#Rate of decomposition}}
Decomposition rates vary among ecosystems. The rate of decomposition is governed by three sets of factors—the physical environment (temperature, moisture, and soil properties), the quantity and quality of the dead material available to decomposers, and the nature of the microbial community itself.&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 159–174&lt;/ref&gt; Temperature controls the rate of microbial respiration; the higher the temperature, the faster microbial decomposition occurs. It also affects soil moisture, which slows microbial growth and reduces leaching. Freeze-thaw cycles also affect decomposition—freezing temperatures kill soil microorganisms, which allows leaching to play a more important role in moving nutrients around. This can be especially important as the soil thaws in the spring, creating a pulse of nutrients which become available.&lt;ref name = "Chapin159"/&gt;

Decomposition rates are low under very wet or very dry conditions. Decomposition rates are highest in wet, moist conditions with adequate levels of oxygen. Wet soils tend to become deficient in oxygen (this is especially true in [[wetland]]s), which slows microbial growth. In dry soils, decomposition slows as well, but bacteria continue to grow (albeit at a slower rate) even after soils become too dry to support plant growth.

===Nutrient cycling===
{{See also|Nutrient cycle|Biogeochemical cycle}}
[[File:Nitrogen Cycle.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Biological nitrogen cycling]]
Ecosystems continually exchange energy and carbon with the wider [[environment (systems)|environment]]. Mineral nutrients, on the other hand, are mostly cycled back and forth between plants, animals, microbes and the soil. Most nitrogen enters ecosystems through biological [[nitrogen fixation]], is deposited through precipitation, dust, gases or is applied as [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref name="Chapin197"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 197–215&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Nitrogen cycle ====
{{Main|Nitrogen cycle}}

Since most [[terrestrial ecosystems]] are nitrogen-limited, [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen cycling]] is an important control on ecosystem production.&lt;ref name="Chapin197" /&gt;

Until modern times, nitrogen fixation was the major source of nitrogen for ecosystems. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria either live [[symbiosis|symbiotically]] with plants or live freely in the soil. The energetic cost is high for plants which support nitrogen-fixing symbionts—as much as 25% of gross primary production when measured in controlled conditions. Many members of the [[legume]] plant family support nitrogen-fixing symbionts. Some [[cyanobacteria]] are also capable of nitrogen fixation. These are [[phototroph]]s, which carry out photosynthesis. Like other nitrogen-fixing bacteria, they can either be free-living or have symbiotic relationships with plants.&lt;ref name = "Chapin197"/&gt; Other sources of nitrogen include [[acid deposition]] produced through the combustion of [[fossil fuel]]s, [[ammonia]] gas which evaporates from agricultural fields which have had fertilizers applied to them, and dust.&lt;ref name = "Chapin197"/&gt; Anthropogenic nitrogen inputs account for about 80% of all nitrogen fluxes in ecosystems.&lt;ref name = "Chapin197"/&gt;

When plant tissues are shed or are eaten, the nitrogen in those tissues becomes available to animals and microbes. Microbial decomposition releases nitrogen compounds from dead organic matter in the soil, where plants, fungi, and bacteria compete for it. Some soil bacteria use organic nitrogen-containing compounds as a source of carbon, and release [[ammonium]] ions into the soil. This process is known as [[ammonification|nitrogen mineralization]]. Others convert ammonium to [[nitrite]] and [[nitrate]] ions, a process known as [[nitrification]]. [[Nitric oxide]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are also produced during nitrification.&lt;ref name = "Chapin197"/&gt; Under nitrogen-rich and oxygen-poor conditions, nitrates and nitrites are converted to [[nitrogen|nitrogen gas]], a process known as [[denitrification]].&lt;ref name = "Chapin197"/&gt;

==== Other nutrients ====
Other important nutrients include [[phosphorus]], [[sulfur]], [[calcium]], [[potassium]], [[magnesium]] and [[manganese]].&lt;ref name = "Chapin215"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 215–222&lt;/ref&gt; Phosphorus enters ecosystems through [[weathering]]. As ecosystems age this supply diminishes, making phosphorus-limitation more common in older landscapes (especially in the tropics).&lt;ref name = "Chapin215"/&gt; Calcium and sulfur are also produced by weathering, but acid deposition is an important source of sulfur in many ecosystems. Although magnesium and manganese are produced by weathering, exchanges between soil organic matter and living cells account for a significant portion of ecosystem fluxes. Potassium is primarily cycled between living cells and soil organic matter.&lt;ref name = "Chapin215"/&gt;

===Function and biodiversity===
{{Main|Biodiversity}}
[[File:View of loch lomond.JPG|thumb|[[Loch Lomond]] in [[Scotland]] forms a relatively isolated ecosystem. The fish community of this lake has remained stable over a long period until a number of [[introduced species|introductions]] in the 1970s restructured it's [[food web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Adams | first=C.E. | title=The fish community of Loch Lomond, Scotland: its history and rapidly changing status | journal=Hydrobiologia | year=1994 | volume=290 | issue=1–3 | pages=91–102 | doi=10.1007/BF00008956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Spiny Forest Ifaty Madagascar.jpg|thumb|Spiny forest at Ifaty, [[Madagascar]], featuring various ''[[Adansonia]]'' (baobab) species, ''[[Alluaudia procera]]'' (Madagascar ocotillo) and other vegetation.]]
[[Biodiversity]] plays an important role in ecosystem functioning.&lt;ref name="Schulze449"&gt;Schulze ''et al''. (2005), pp. 449–453&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is that ecosystem processes are driven by the number of species in an ecosystem, the exact nature of each individual species, and the relative abundance organisms within these species.&lt;ref name="Chapin265"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 265–277&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystem processes are broad generalizations that actually take place through the actions of individual organisms. The nature of the organisms—the species, [[functional group (ecology)|functional groups]] and trophic levels to which they belong—dictates the sorts of actions these individuals are capable of carrying out and the relative efficiency with which they do so. 

Ecological theory suggests that in order to coexist, species must have some level of [[limiting similarity]]—they must be different from one another in some fundamental way, otherwise one species would [[competitive exclusion|competitively exclude]] the other.&lt;ref name="niche"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schoener|first=Thomas W.|title=The Princeton Guide to Ecology|editor=[[Simon A. Levin]]|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|year=2009|pages=2–13|chapter=Ecological Niche|isbn=978-0-691-12839-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the cumulative effect of additional species in an ecosystem is not linear—additional species may enhance nitrogen retention, for example, but beyond some level of species richness, additional species may have little additive effect.&lt;ref name = "Chapin265"/&gt; 

The addition (or loss) of species which are ecologically similar to those already present in an ecosystem tends to only have a small effect on ecosystem function. Ecologically distinct species, on the other hand, have a much larger effect. Similarly, dominant species have a large effect on ecosystem function, while rare species tend to have a small effect. [[Keystone species]] tend to have an effect on ecosystem function that is disproportionate to their abundance in an ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Chapin265" /&gt; Similarly, an [[ecosystem engineer]] is any [[organism]] that creates, significantly modifies, maintains or destroys a [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]].

===Dynamics===

Ecosystems are dynamic entities. They are subject to periodic disturbances and are in the process of recovering from some past disturbance.&lt;ref name="Chapin281"&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology|last=Chapin|first=F. Stuart|author2=Pamela A. Matson|author3=Harold A. Mooney|publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=0-387-95443-0|location=New York|pages=281–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a [[perturbation (biology)|perturbation]] occurs, an ecoystem responds by moving away from its initial state. The tendency of an ecosystem to remain close to its equilibrium state, despite that disturbance, is termed its [[resistance (ecology)|resistance]]. On the other hand, the speed with which it returns to its initial state after disturbance is called its [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]].&lt;ref name = "Chapin281"/&gt; Time plays a role in the development of soil from bare rock and the [[ecological succession|recovery of a community from disturbance]].&lt;ref name="Chapin11" /&gt;

From one year to another, ecosystems experience variation in their biotic and abiotic environments. A drought, an especially cold winter and a pest outbreak all constitute short-term variability in environmental conditions. Animal populations vary from year to year, building up during resource-rich periods and crashing as they overshoot their food supply. These changes play out in changes in [[net primary production]] [[decomposition]] rates, and other ecosystem processes.&lt;ref name = "Chapin281"/&gt; Longer-term changes also shape ecosystem processes—the forests of eastern North America still show legacies of cultivation which ceased 200 years ago, while [[methane]] production in eastern [[Siberia|Siberian]] lakes is controlled by organic matter which accumulated during the [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref name = "Chapin281"/&gt;

[[Disturbance (ecology)|Disturbance]] also plays an important role in ecological processes. [[F. Stuart Chapin III|F. Stuart Chapin]] and coauthors define disturbance as "a relatively discrete event in time and space that alters the structure of populations, communities, and ecosystems and causes changes in resources availability or the physical environment".&lt;ref name = "Chapin 285"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; This can range from tree falls and insect outbreaks to hurricanes and wildfires to volcanic eruptions. Such disturbances can cause large changes in plant, animal and microbe populations, as well soil organic matter content.&lt;ref name = "Chapin281"/&gt; Disturbance is followed by [[ecological succession|succession]], a "directional change in ecosystem structure and functioning resulting from biotically driven changes in resources supply."&lt;ref name = "Chapin 285"/&gt;

The frequency and severity of disturbance determine the way it affects ecosystem function. A major disturbance like a volcanic eruption or [[Glacier|glacial]] advance and retreat leave behind soils that lack plants, animals or organic matter. Ecosystems that experience such disturbances undergo [[primary succession]]. A less severe disturbance like forest fires, hurricanes or cultivation result in [[secondary succession]] and a faster recovery.&lt;ref name = "Chapin281"/&gt; More severe disturbance and more frequent disturbance result in longer recovery times.

==Human activities==
Human activities are important in almost all ecosystems. Although humans exist and operate within ecosystems, their cumulative effects are large enough to influence external factors like climate.&lt;ref name="Chapin11" /&gt;

Ecosystems provide a variety of goods and services upon which people depend.&lt;ref name="Christensen1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Christensen |first1=Norman L. |first2=Ann M. |last2=Bartuska |first3=James H. |last3=Brown |first4=Stephen |last4=Carpenter |first5=Carla |last5=D'Antonio |first6=Robert |last6=Francis |first7=Jerry F. |last7=Franklin |first8=James A. |last8=MacMahon |first9=Reed F. |last9=Noss |first10=David J. |last10=Parsons |first11=Charles H. |last11=Peterson |first12=Monica G. |last12=Turner |first13=Robert G. |last13=Woodmansee |year=1996|title=The Report of the Ecological Society of America Committee on the Scientific Basis for Ecosystem Management|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=6|issue=3|pages=665–691|doi=10.2307/2269460|citeseerx=10.1.1.404.4909 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystem goods include the "tangible, material products" of ecosystem processes such as food, construction material, medicinal plants.&lt;ref name="Brown2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Thomas C.|author2=John C.

[[Ecosystem services]], on the other hand, are generally "improvements in the condition or location of things of value".&lt;ref name="Brown2007" /&gt; These include things like the maintenance of hydrological cycles, cleaning air and water, the maintenance of oxygen in the atmosphere, crop [[pollination]] and even things like beauty, inspiration and opportunities for research.&lt;ref name="Christensen1998" /&gt; While ecosystem goods have traditionally been recognized as being the basis for things of economic value, ecosystem services tend to be taken for granted.&lt;ref name="Brown2007" /&gt;

===Ecosystem management===
{{Main article|Ecosystem management}}
{{See also|Ecological economics|Sustainability|Sustainable development}}
When [[natural resource management]] is applied to whole ecosystems, rather than single species, it is termed [[ecosystem management]].&lt;ref name="Grumbine1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grumbine |first=R. Edward |year=1994 |title=What is ecosystem management? |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=27–38 |url=http://www.pelagicos.net/MARS6920_spring2010/readings/Grumbine_1994.pdf |doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1994.08010027.x |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502051519/http://www.pelagicos.net/MARS6920_spring2010/readings/Grumbine_1994.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although definitions of ecosystem management abound, there is a common set of principles which underlie these definitions.&lt;ref name="Chapin362"&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology|last=Chapin|first=F. Stuart|author2=Pamela A. Matson|author3=Harold A. Mooney|publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=0-387-95443-0|location=New York|pages=362–365}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental principle is the long-term [[sustainability]] of the production of goods and services by the ecosystem;&lt;ref name = "Chapin362"/&gt; "intergenerational sustainability [is] a precondition for management, not an afterthought".&lt;ref name="Christensen1998"/&gt; 

While ecosystem management can be used as part of a plan for [[wilderness]] conservation, it can also be used in intensively managed ecosystems&lt;ref name="Christensen1998"/&gt; (see, for example, [[agroecosystem]] and [[close to nature forestry]]).

===Threats caused by humans===
{{see also|Planetary boundaries}}
As human population and per capita consumption grow, so do the resource demands imposed on ecosystems and the effects of the human [[ecological footprint]]. Natural resources are vulnerable and limited. The environmental impacts of [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] actions are becoming more apparent. Problems for all ecosystems include: [[Pollution|environmental pollution]], [[climate change]] and [[biodiversity loss]]. For [[Terrestrial ecosystem|terrestrial ecosystems]] further threats include [[air pollution]], [[Soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]],  and [[deforestation]]. For [[aquatic ecosystems]] threats include also unsustainable exploitation of marine resources (for example [[overfishing]] of certain species), [[marine pollution]], [[microplastics]] pollution, [[water pollution]], and building on coastal areas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book| last = Alexander| first = David E.| title = Encyclopedia of Environmental Science| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]| date = 1 May 1999| isbn = 0-412-74050-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Society is increasingly becoming aware that [[ecosystem services]] are not only limited but also that they are threatened by human activities. The need to better consider long-term [[ecosystem health]] and its role in enabling human habitation and economic activity is urgent. To help inform decision-makers, many ecosystem services are being assigned economic values, often based on the cost of replacement with anthropogenic alternatives. The ongoing challenge of prescribing economic value to nature, for example through [[biodiversity banking]], is prompting transdisciplinary shifts in how we recognize and manage the environment, [[social responsibility]], business opportunities, and our future as a species.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== History ==
The term "ecosystem" was first used in 1935 in a publication by British ecologist [[Arthur Tansley]].&lt;ref group="fn"&gt;The term ecosystem was actually coined by [[Arthur Roy Clapham]], who came up with the word at Tansley's request (Willis 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Willis1997"&gt;Willis (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Tansley devised the concept to draw attention to the importance of transfers of materials between organisms and their environment.&lt;ref name = "Chapin7"&gt;Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 7–11)&lt;/ref&gt; He later refined the term, describing it as "The whole system, ... including not only the organism-complex, but also the whole complex of physical factors forming what we call the environment".&lt;ref name="Tansley1935"&gt;Tansley (1935)&lt;/ref&gt; Tansley regarded ecosystems not simply as natural units, but as "mental isolates".&lt;ref name="Tansley1935" /&gt; Tansley later defined the spatial extent of ecosystems using the term [[ecotope]].&lt;ref name="Tansley1939"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1io8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP1|title=The British Islands and Their Vegetation|last=Tansley|first=A.G.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1939|authorlink=Arthur Tansley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]], a [[limnologist]] who was a contemporary of Tansley's, combined [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]]'s ideas about [[Trophic level|trophic]] ecology with those of Russian geochemist [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]. As a result, he suggested that mineral nutrient availability in a lake limited [[Algal bloom|algal production]]. This would, in turn, limit the abundance of animals that feed on algae. [[Raymond Lindeman]] took these ideas further to suggest that the flow of energy through a lake was the primary driver of the ecosystem. Hutchinson's students, brothers [[Howard T. Odum]] and [[Eugene P. Odum]], further developed a "systems approach" to the study of ecosystems. This allowed them to study the flow of energy and material through ecological systems.&lt;ref name = "Chapin7"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7700">The '''European Parliamentary Technology Assessment''' (EPTA) is a network of [[technology assessment]] (TA) institutions specialising in advising parliamentary bodies in Europe.

[[Image:epta.jpg|thumb|EPTA-Logo]]

== Objectives ==

The EPTA partners advise parliaments on the possible social, economic and environmental impact of new sciences and technologies. The common aim is to provide impartial and high quality analysis and reports of developments in issues such as for example [[bioethics]] and [[biotechnology]], [[public health]], environment and energy, [[information and communication technologies|ICTs]], and R&amp;D policy. Such work is seen as an aid to the democratic control of scientific and technological innovations, and was pioneered in the 1970s by the [[Office of Technology Assessment]] (OTA) of the [[US Congress]]. EPTA aims to advance the establishment of [[technology assessment]] (TA) as an integral part of policy formation in parliamentary decision-making processes in Europe, and to strengthen the links between TA units in Europe.

== History and Organisation ==

The EPTA network was formally established in 1990, on a recommendation by the UK’s parliamentary TA office – [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology]], under the patronage of the President of the [[European Parliament]], Mr [[Enrique Baron Crespo]]. The network has a light structure, guided by the EPTA ''Council'' and by meetings of the ''Directors'' of the EPTA partner organisations. The EPTA Council is the steering committee of the EPTA network, and consists of Members of Parliament or representatives of the advisory boards for the respective EPTA organisation. The Council decides on organisational matters such as co-operation within the network and the status of members and associates. The ''Presidency'' of EPTA rotates among full members each year. The tasks of the EPTA member organisation holding the presidency are to coordinate the EPTA network activities and to host the annual EPTA conference, Council meeting and Directors' meeting.

== Members ==

Parliamentary TA is institutionalised in different ways, ranging from permanent parliamentary committees for TA; separate TA units as part of the parliamentary administration; to independent institutions with a mandate to serve as a permanent consulting institution for the parliament. The members of the EPTA network are European organisations, which carry out TA studies on behalf of parliaments. Full membership can be obtained by a unit that operates in Europe, is devoted to TA or related activities, serves a (supra-national, national or regional) parliament, has its own budget and secretariat and has an active work programme including publications on issues with a scientific and technological component. Associate membership can be granted to other TA units that have a TA programme and the resources to realise it, but that do not fulfil other criteria for full membership. Associates are involved in all EPTA activities but are not represented in the EPTA Council. Further, other units interested in the work of EPTA can act as observers.

There are currently '''12 full members''':

'''European Pathway to Zero Waste''' is an EU demonstration project part funded by [[The LIFE Programme]] (LIFE+), the EU’s funding instrument for the environment and is a partnership between the [[Environment Agency]] and [[Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme]] (WRAP). The project has been set up to investigate practical ways to achieve zero waste to landfill in the South East of England. It will share the results with colleagues both in the UK and in relevant EU Member States. Zero waste in this context is an approach to supporting the sustainable use of resources by business to benefit both the economy and the environment. It concentrates on reducing, re-using, recycling and recovering energy from waste. The project will run to March 2013.

'''Feminist sexology''' is an offshoot of traditional studies of [[sexology]] that focuses on the [[intersectionality]] of [[sex]] and [[gender]] in relation to the [[sexual lives]] of [[women]]. Sexology has a basis in psychoanalysis, specifically Freudian theory, which played a big role in early sexology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohler|first=Bertram J.|last2=Galatzer-Levy|first2=Robert M.|date=2008-01-03|title=Freud, Anna, and the Problem of Female Sexuality|journal=Psychoanalytic Inquiry|volume=28|issue=1|pages=3–26|doi=10.1080/07351690701787085|issn=0735-1690}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reactionary field of feminist sexology seeks to be inclusive of experiences of sexuality and break down the problematic ideas that have been expressed by sexology in the past. [[Feminist]] sexology shares many principles with the overarching field of sexology; in particular, it does not try to prescribe a certain path or "normality" for women's sexuality, but only observe and note the different and varied ways in which women express their sexuality. It is a young field, but one that is growing rapidly.

==Themes==
Many of the topics that feminist sexologists study include (but are not limited to) [[reproductive rights]], [[sex work]], [[gay]] and [[transgender]] identities, [[marriage]], [[pornography]] and [[gender roles]]. Much of the work within feminist sexology has been done within the last few decades, focusing on the movements of sexual liberation in the 1960s and 1970s, the introduction of an easily handled and effective means of contraception, [[lesbian]] and transgender visibility, and the stronger waves of women taking charge of their lives. There has been much debate about whether the sexual revolution was really beneficial to women, if a pro-sex attitude can really be achieved within the context of Western society, but as new voices are lifted, layers of interpretation and knowledge can be gathered.

* Lesbianism - Lesbianism is a major theme of feminist sexology. Lesbian society and culture is one that is often over-looked by general society resulting in lesbian women being disregarded and ultimately ignored in public and professional spaces. In the workplace, for example, lesbian women are often still sexualized and forced to play the role of the ‘heterosexual female.’ Feminist theorist Adrienne Rich discusses this type of oppression in her article, “Compulsory Heterosexuality.” Adrienne Rich claims,
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Women endure sexual harassment to keep their jobs and learn to behave in a complacently and ingratiatingly heterosexual manner… the woman who too decisively resists sexual overtures in the workplace is accused of being ‘dried-up and sexless, or lesbian.”&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Rich, A. (1980). Compulsory heterosexuality and lesbian existence. ''Signs: Journal of women in culture and society'', ''5''(4), 631-660.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The lesbian in society is of utmost importance in that she bears the weight of judgement and oppression on her shoulders for love and the progression of the woman. On page 649 of “Compulsory Heterosexuality” Rich writes, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Lesbian existence comprises both the breaking of a taboo and the rejection of a compulsory way of life.”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Prostitution - In Gayle Rubin’s article “Thinking Sex,” Rubin discusses the shift of prostitution from a once socially acceptable occupation to a now isolated and reprimanded occupation in modern-day society. This shift in society perception known as the “modernization of sex.” The modernization of sex in the case of prostitution is defined as; the organization of sex groups such as prostitutes, homoesexuals, sadomasochists, etc. into localized populations. On page 156 of “Thinking Sex” Rubin regards the occupation of prostitution and its place in present-day society,
	&lt;blockquote&gt;“Sex work is an occupation… Prostitutes are a criminal sexual population stigmatized on the basis of sexual activity… Prostitutes are the primary prey of vice police.”&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Rubin, G. (1984). Thinking sex: Notes for a radical theory of the politics of sexuality. ''Social Perspectives in Lesbian and Gay Studies; A Reader'', 100-133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Anti-prostitution laws have also surfaced in recent years, dismantling prostitution in local jurisdictions and restricting various forms of sexual commerce. On page 163, Rubin writes how these actions are justified:
	&lt;blockquote&gt;“[These actions are] rationalized by portraying them as menaces to health and safety, women and children… or civilization itself. Even when activity is acknowledged to be harmless, it may be banned because it is alleged to ‘lead’ to something ostensibly worse.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Children and Sexuality

In her article “Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality,” Gayle Rubin states that society teaches children about gender and sex; they know nothing about it when they are born, because gender and sex are socially constructed ideas.  Society teaches our children about social norms through actions. This models gender through behavior and children learn to act in a certain way depending if they are male or female.&lt;br /&gt;

During the nineteenth century, the idea of masturbation was considered to be a taboo and unhealthy practice.  What was thought of as premature sexual interest in a child was strongly discouraged, because sexual excitement of any kind was thought to damage the health and discourage the maturation of a child. In the past, parents have resorted to extreme measures to prevent children from masturbating, such as tying them down to keep from touching themselves or even making permanent surgical changes to their genitals. While these extreme measures have for the most part been abandoned in today’s society, the attitude that the idea of sex is harmful to children still endures. &lt;br /&gt;

According to Anne Fausto-Stearling, Infant Genital Surgery is a cosmetic surgery performed on infants who do not fit into a defined gender category (sometimes with or without the parent’s consent).  The surgery reshapes their sexual reproductive organs into either male or female gender binaries without considering the child’s wishes or what they may have chosen later in life.  This can lead to gender confusion and unhappiness as the child grows, and may even have a biological physical impact on how the child’s reproductive organs develop.

* Sex and Respectability
Gayle Rubin argues that modern society judges sex acts through their theoretical value.  She states that “Marital, reproductive heterosexuals are alone at the top erotic pyramid.”  This means that because the people engaging in sex are married, heterosexual, and the possibility of reproduction is present, the act of sex has a higher value in accordance with societal norms.  Unmarried heterosexual sex is also valued, but not as much. Monogamous, heteronormative lesbian and gay relationships are not quite as respected, but are considered to still be of minimal value. “The most despised sexual castes currently include transsexuals, transvestites, fetishists, sadomasochists, sex workers such as prostitutes and porn models...” Solitary sex acts, or masturbation, are not even considered a part of the hierarchy.  These sex acts are ordered in such a way because of their ability to reproduce and create children. “According to this system, sexuality that is ‘good’, ‘normal’, and ‘natural’ should ideally be heterosexual, marital, monogamous, reproductive, and non-commercial.”  Anything relating to sex that breaks these societally prescribed rules is considered to be “bad” and “unnatural,” such as homosexuality, fetish objects, the use of pornography, and casual sex, amongst others.
 &lt;blockquote&gt;“All these hierarchies of sexual value – religious, psychiatric, and popular – function in much the same ways as do ideological systems of racism, ethnocentrism, and religious chauvinism. They rationalize the well-being of the sexually privileged and the adversity of the sexual rabble.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Influential thinkers==
* [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]] - Fausto-Sterling, with a background in biology, has written several books on the subject of how gender interacts and is shaped by biology, society and culture. In her book, Sexing the Body, she takes a close look on how the definition of our sex and gender as a species by the society relegates our sexual identities and actions. She also tackles these subjects in her other works, including her books ''Myths of Gender'' and ''Love, Power and Knowledge'' (which she co-wrote with Hilary Rose.)
* [[Gayle Rubin]] - Rubin, a [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]], focuses on many subjects, notably [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], [[sadomasochism]] and [[sexual subcultures]]. She has been a strong voice in the "pro-sex" arena of sexology, debating strongly the intersection of [[sexual identity]] and societal structure in the 1980s, during which it was dubbed the "[[Feminist Sex Wars]]." She also worked with [[Patrick Califia]] studying the gay [[Leather subculture|leather scene]].

==Three Main Points==

;Male power
Under the patriarchal culture of sexual desire, women are suppressed to express their true feeling about sexual behaviors. Women’s fear of desire keeps them quiet and justify society’s belief that men have the power and authority in the relationships. Women are not allowed to express their sexual needs and male power is against masturbation.

While being taught to be conservative about sexual desire, women are also taught in a contradictory way that their bodies should be readily available for the pleasure of men without having a sexual voice. Sexology has a basis within psychology and the way the DSM-5 has categorized female sexual dysfunctions play into issues of male power over the sexuality of women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Chloë|date=2015|title=Female Sexual Dysfunction, Feminist Sexology, and the Psychiatry of the Normal|jstor=10.15767/feministstudies.41.2.259|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=41|issue=2|pages=259–292|doi=10.15767/feministstudies.41.2.259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angel, K. (2010). The history of ‘female sexual dysfunction’ as a mental disorder in the 20th century. ''Current opinion in psychiatry,'' ''23''(6), 536.&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to sexual dysfunction among women, most are categorized as the woman having lowered sexual desire that causes “personal distress” over a period of time. Often times, the personal distress that women are feeling is due to relationship problems, and an irritated partner from the lack of sexual desire. “Women are diagnosed and treated as sexually disordered because they have sex-related marital tensions, even if they are personally well adjusted to their sexual response.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The DSM-5 fails to recognize other reasons a woman may not want to engage in sexually activity, and does not talk about “sexual communication, emotion, whole body experience, taboo and danger, commitment, attraction, sexual knowledge, safety, respect, feelings about bodies, breast cycles, pregnancy, contraception or getting old.” Furthermore, the sexual sciences do not necessarily repress female sexuality as they base it on heteronormative masculinity without giving women a voice about their own sexuality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Women not having a voice about their own sexuality is a highly recognized problem in various fields of feminist theory. In “The Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power,” Audre Lorde offers the solution that the erotic can be used as power to gain a voice about sexuality that is not based on male desire.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; “Our acts against oppression become integral with self, motivated and empowered from within,” states Audre Lorde. For Lorde, “the erotic” is not just sexuality; it is the power for people to love and be passionate about what they do in life. She sees “the erotic” as “power” because she believes that if women have erotic “power”, they can have voice and be themselves in their lives.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lorde, Audre. The Uses of the Erotic. Kore Press, Jan. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the concept of [[compulsory heterosexuality]] makes the society believes that lesbian's sexuality is out of the norm. While there is a general recognition that the majority of sexual acts occur without the intent of reproduction, the definition of sex is still biological in nature, meaning that sex is heterosexual sex and that entails vaginal intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Politics of Sexual Knowledge: Feminism and Sexology Textbooks|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men believe that lesbians would defeat their power so they force heterosexuality as a default sexual orientation and disdain lesbians to make coming out difficult. Lesbianism is a threat to male supremacy because it destroys the myth about female inferiority, weakness, passivity.&lt;ref&gt;Bunch, Charlotte. ''Lesbians in Revolt''. 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having said this, ideas about homosexuality are rooted in problematic ideas that were set forth by men in academic power. Homosexuality in general has historically been viewed by 20th century sexologists and psychoanalysts to be a disorder that people must normalize from.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexology in culture : labelling bodies and desires|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=Bland, Lucy., Doan, Laura L., 1951-|isbn=9780226056678|location=Chicago|oclc=38747894}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuality from Sigmund Freud’s point of view was seen as a pathology in which people were affected by due to disturbances within psychosexual stages.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; From Freud’s theories about homosexuality, some came to the conclusion that homosexuality was something that could be treated. Additionally, Richard von Krafft-Ebing referred to lesbianism as being “incurable” although he still discussed how it could be treated.&lt;ref&gt;Maciejewski, S. P. (2016). The Relationship Between Sexology and the Lesbian Identity in Early 20th-Century Britain.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Sexual Violence
Sexual assault, rape and domestic sexual violence are serious issues in our society. Each year, for 35 of every 1,000 college women, those life-changing events will include a sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Bonnie S., Francis T. Cullen, and Michael G. Turner. The Sexual Victimization of College Women. National Institute of Justice, Dec. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Many people blame sexual harassment and rape on women for staying outside at night, wearing short skirts, or flirting. The society puts the fault on women’s behaviors, trying to make them feel bad. When women start thinking themselves as “trouble makers”, they remain silent. Moreover, many victims are afraid of embarrassing their families and believe that rape victims rarely get justice, instead they will be scolded. Even though all women face this oppression, women of color are more vulnerable to sexual assault than white women. The Jezebel stereotype portrays women of colors as “unrapeable”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sapac.umich.edu/article/57 | title=Communities of Color and the Impacts of Sexual Violence &amp;#124; Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jezebel stereotype began when 17th century European travelled to Africa and misinterpreted the nudity and polygamy of natives as uncontrollable sexual lust. This view of Black women was also perpetuated during slavery as a means to justify the sexual abuse, rape, and exploitation of these women by their slave owners.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ferris.edu/HTMLS/news/jimcrow/jezebel/index.htm|title=The Jezebel Stereotype - Anti-black Imagery - Jim Crow Museum - Ferris State University|website=ferris.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stereotype is still widely used today in cinema, music, television and other forms of media.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
* Jezebel: The stereotype that deems African American women as promiscuous, seductive, hypersexual, uncaring, and willing to use sex as a way of manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.skepticink.com/gps/2015/04/28/mammy-jezebel-sapphire-or-queen-stereotypes-of-the-african-american-female/|title=Mammy, Jezebel, Sapphire, or Queen? Stereotypes of the African-American Female • Great Plains Skeptic|date=2015-04-28|work=Great Plains Skeptic|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Followed by this stereotype is a belief that Black women should be responsible for being sexual assaulted. Society justifies rape as a crime that only happens to women who asked for it.
Sexual violence is also a significant problem that is faced by trans and gender-nonconforming people. Trans people are often discriminated against by medical professionals, police officers, the court system, and other authoritative figures.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iamoneofthem-why-we-need-to-represent-trans-people_us_58e7a32be4b0acd784ca5768|title=#IAmOneOfThem: Why We Need To Represent Trans People In Sexual Assault Advocacy|last=Clements|first=K. C.|date=2017-04-07|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, trans people are extremely vulnerable to sexual assault and often are not offered the resources to seek help, cope, and heal in a non judgmental setting. When looking at intersections of race, class, and ability, trans people are even more likely to be sexually assaulted when they face multiple levels of oppression.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
;Control of Body
Women face the issue of not being able to make decisions regarding their reproductive rights or their bodies generally. Women are still fighting for access to birth control and the right of choice when it comes to abortion. Birth control and abortion have been highly politicized which has ended up politicizing women’s bodies.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The politics of women's bodies : sexuality, appearance, and behavior|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Weitz, Rose, 1952-|isbn=9780195109948|location=New York|oclc=36470306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor women and women of color are likely to have even less option and access to making reproductive choices. In the Supreme Court Case, Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, banned public facilities and employees in Missouri from performing abortions unless it was a life saving procedure for the mother.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Prior to this, Maher v. Roe determined that welfare payments could not be used for non therapeutic abortions even though they could be used expenses related to childbirth.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These court decisions have ultimately worked in a way that do not allow poor women to choose to have an abortion.

Furthermore, women of color, especially Black, Latina, and Native American women have fallen victim to sterilization abuse. Native American women have faced being sterilized without consent or by being coerced as a result of the ideologies of imperialism, capitalism, patriarchy, and socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpio|first=Myla Vicenti|date=2004|title=The Lost Generation: American Indian Women and Sterilization Abuse|jstor=29768273|journal=Social Justice|volume=31|issue=4 (98)|pages=40–53|doi=10.2307/29768273|doi-broken-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterilization abuse and the use birth control were seen as “a duty, not a right” for poor women of color.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, A. (2003). Racism, birth control and reproductive rights. ''Feminist Postcolonial Theory–A Reader'', 353-367.&lt;/ref&gt; Issues within reproductive rights and control of the body are not isolated to the western world but are also global issues. Many women around the world, especially in Africa and Asia, are the victims of sex trafficking, sex slavery, child labor, genital mutilation or cutting and sterilization. Those women neither have controls of their own bodies nor freedom to speak for themselves. The documentary, based on the book, [[Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide]], focuses on this issues in six different countries. It talks about what sexual oppression women are facing in these places, how the government ignores and justifies the issues, and what organizations are working to fight for these victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/half-the-sky/ | title=Half the Sky &amp;#124; Independent Lens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''flat roof'''  is a roof which is almost level in contrast to the many types of [[List of roof shapes|sloped roofs]]. The slope of a roof is properly known as its [[Roof pitch|pitch]] and flat roofs have up to approximately 10°.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Cyril M.. "Flat roof". ''Harris dictionary of architecture &amp; construction''. 3rd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2000. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Flat roofs are an ancient form mostly used in [[arid climate]]s and allow the roof space to be used as a living space or a [[Green roof|living roof]]. Flat roofs, or "low-slope" roofs, are also commonly found on commercial buildings throughout the world. The [[National Roofing Contractors Association]] defines a low-slope roof as having a slope of 3-in-12 or less.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docserver.nrca.net/technical/5936.pdf National Roofing Contractors Association (Technical Library)]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Flat roofs==
Flat roofs exist all over the world and each area has its own tradition or preference for materials used. In warmer climates, where there is less rainfall and freezing is unlikely to occur, many flat roofs are simply built of masonry or concrete and this is good at keeping out the heat of the sun and cheap and easy to build where timber is not readily available. In areas where the roof could become saturated by rain and leak, or where water soaked into the brickwork could freeze to ice and thus lead to 'blowing' (breaking up of the mortar/brickwork/concrete by the expansion of ice as it forms) these roofs are not suitable. Flat roofs are characteristic of the Egyptian, Persian, and Arabian styles of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Passmore, Augustine C.. "Twenty Styles of Architecture". ''Handbook of technical terms used in architecture and building and their allied trades and subjects'',. London: Scott, Greenwood, and Co.;, 1904. 360. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction methods==
{{unreferenced|section|date=April 2018}}
Any sheet of material used to cover a flat or low-pitched roof is usually known as a membrane and the primary purpose of these membranes is to waterproof the roof area. Materials that cover flat roofs typically allow the [[water]] to run off from a slight inclination or camber into a gutter system. Water from some flat roofs such as on garden sheds sometimes flows freely off the edge of a roof, though gutter systems are of advantage in keeping both walls and foundations dry. Gutters on smaller roofs often lead water directly onto the ground, or better, into a specially made soakaway. Gutters on larger roofs usually lead water into the rainwater drainage system of any built up area. Occasionally, however, flat roofs are designed to collect water in a pool, usually for aesthetic purposes, or for rainwater buffering.

Traditionally most flat roofs in the western world make use of [[tar]] or asphalt more usually felt paper applied over roof decking to keep a building watertight. The felt paper is in turn covered with a flood coat of bitumen (asphalt or tar) and then [[gravel]] to keep the sun's heat, UV rays and weather off it and helps protect it from cracking or blistering and degradation. Roof decking is usually of plywood, chipboard or OSB boards (OSB = [[Oriented Strand Board]], also known as [[Sterling board]]) of around 18mm thickness, steel or concrete. The mopping of bitumen is applied in two or more coats (usually 3 or 4) as a hot liquid, heated in a kettle. A flooded coat of bitumen is applied over the felts and gravel is embedded in the hot bitumen.

A main reason for failure of these traditional roofs is ignorance or lack of maintenance where people or events cause the gravel to be moved or removed from the roof membrane, commonly called a built-up roof, thus exposing it to weather and sun. Cracking and blistering occurs and eventually water gets in.

Roofing felts are usually a 'paper' or fiber material impregnated in bitumen. As gravel cannot protect tarpaper surfaces where they rise vertically from the roof such as on parapet walls or upstands, the felts are usually coated with bitumen and protected by sheet metal flashings. 

In some microclimates or shaded areas these rather 'basic' felt roofs can last well in relation to the cost of materials purchase and cost of laying them, however the cost of modern membranes such as EPDM has come down over recent years to make them more and more affordable. There are now firms supplying modern alternatives.

If a leak does occur on a flat roof, damage often goes unnoticed for considerable time as water penetrates and soaks the decking and any insulation and/or structure beneath. This can lead to expensive damage from the rot which often develops and if left can weaken the roof structure. There are health risks to people and animals breathing the mould spores: the severity of this health risk remains a debated point.  While the insulation is wet, the “R” value is essentially destroyed.  If dealing with an organic insulation, the most common solution is removing and replacing the damaged area.  If the problem is detected early enough, the insulation may be saved by repairing the leak, but if it has progressed to creating a sunken area, it may be too late.

One problem with maintaining flat roofs is that if water does penetrate the barrier covering (be it traditional or a modern membrane), it can travel a long way before causing visible damage or leaking into a building where it can be seen. Thus, it is not easy to find the source of the leak in order to repair it. Once underlying roof decking is soaked, it often sags, creating more room for water to accumulate and further worsening the problem.

Another common reason for failure of flat roofs is lack of drain maintenance where gravel, leaves and debris block water outlets (be they spigots, drains, downpipes or gutters). This causes a pressure head of water (the deeper the water, the greater the pressure) which can force more water into the smallest hole or crack. In colder climates, puddling water can freeze, breaking up the roof surface as the ice expands. It is therefore important to maintain your flat roof to avoid excessive repair.

An important consideration in tarred flat roof quality is knowing that the common term  'tar' applies to rather different products: tar or pitch (which is derived from wood resins), coal tar, asphalt and bitumen. Some of these products appear to have been interchanged in their use and are sometimes used inappropriately, as each has different characteristics, for example whether or not the product can soak into wood, its anti-fungal properties and its reaction to exposure to sun, weather, and varying temperatures.

Modern flat roofs can use single large factory-made sheets such as EPDM synthetic rubber, PVC (polyvinyl chloride), TPO (thermplastic polyolefin) etc. Although usually of excellent quality, one-piece membranes are called single plies are used today on many large commercial buildings. Modified bitumen mebranes which are widely available in one metre widths are bonded together in either hot or cold seaming processes during the fitting process, where labour skill and training play a large part in determining the quality of roof protection attained. Reasons for not using one-piece membranes include practicality and cost: on all but the smallest of roofs it can be difficult to lift a huge and heavy membrane (a crane or lift is required) and if there is any wind at all it can be difficult to control and bond the membrane smoothly and properly to the roof.

Detailing of these systems also plays a part in success or failure: In some systems ready-made details (such as internal and external corners, through-roof pipe flashings, cable or skylight flashings etc.) are available from the membrane manufacturer and can be well bonded to the main sheet, whereas with materials such as tar papers this is usually not the case – a fitter has to construct these shapes on-site. Success depends largely on their levels of skill, enthusiasm and training – results can vary hugely.

Metals are also used for flat roofs: lead (welded or folded-seamed), tin (folded, soldered or folded-seamed) or copper. These are often expensive options and vulnerable to being stolen and sold as scrap metal.

Flat roofs tend to be sensitive to human traffic. Anything which produces a crack or puncture in the waterproofing membrane can quite readily lead to leaks. Flat roofs can fail, for example; when subsequent work is carried out on the roof, when new through-roof service pipes/cables are installed or when plant such as air conditioning units are installed. A good roofer should be called to make sure the roof is left properly watertight before it is left. In trafficked areas, proper advisory/warning signs should be put up and walkways of rubber matting, wooden or plastic duck-boarding etc. should be installed to protect the roof membrane. On some membranes, even stone or concrete paving can be fitted. For one-off works, old carpet or smooth wooden planks for workers to walk or stand on will usually provide reasonable protection.

Traditionally the smelly, hot, physically demanding and sometimes dangerous work of tarring flat roofs has often meant that uneducated fitters of doubtful reputation have done work to a poor standard: This together with a lack of regular inspection and maintenance has meant that flat roofs have a poor reputation and there is an unwillingness to retain or to build them, which is unfortunate, given the potential usefulness of flat areas, the more so with the excellent performance of modern membranes, many of which come with long warranties and  provide an excellent roof covering.

[[Modernist]] architecture often viewed the flat roof as a living area.  [[Le Corbusier|Le Corbusier's]] theoretical works, particularly Vers une Architecture, and the influential [[Villa Savoye]] and [[Unité d'Habitation]] prominently feature rooftop [[Terrace (building)|terraces]]. That said, Villa Savoye's roof began leaking almost immediately after the Savoye family moved in. Le Corbusier only narrowly avoided a lawsuit from the family because they had to flee the country as France succumbed to the German Army in WWII.

==Flat roof developments==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2014}}

===Protected membrane roof===
A protected membrane roof is a roof where thermal insulation or another material is located above the waterproofing membrane. Modern green roofs are a type of protected membrane roof. This development has been made possible by the creation of waterproofing membrane materials that are tolerant of supporting a load and the creation of thermal insulation that is not easily damaged by water. Frequently, rigid panels made of [[polystyrene|extruded polystyrene]] are used in PMR construction. The chief benefit of PMR roof design is that the covering protects the waterproofing membrane from thermal shock, ultraviolet light and mechanical damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buildings.com/article-details/articleid/5019/title/protected-membrane-roof-systems.aspx |title=Protected Membrane Roof Systems |accessdate=2014-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; One potential disadvantage of protected membrane roof construction is the need for structural strength to support the weight of ballast that prevents wind from moving rigid foam panels or the weight of plants and growth media for a green roof. However, when flat roofs are constructed in temperate climates, the need to support [[Structural load#Environmental loads|snow load]] makes additional structural strength a common consideration in any event.

Protected membrane roofs are sometimes referred to in the roofing industry as "IRMA" roofs, for "Inverted Roof Membrane Assembly". "IRMA" as a roofing term is a [[Generic trademark|genericized trademark]]. Originally,  "IRMA" was a registered trademark of the [[Dow Chemical Company]] and stood for "Insulated Roof Membrane Assembly"  and referred to PMR roofs assembled using Dow brand extruded polystyrene insulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rci-online.org/wp-content/uploads/2000-05-watts.pdf|title=PMR Systems: The Forgotten Solution|last=Watts|first=Mike|date=May 2000|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Green roofs===
Grass or turf roofs have been around since the Viking times if not far earlier and make for a decorative and durable roof covering. Green roofs have been made by depositing topsoil or other growth media on flat roofs and seeding them (or allowing them to self-seed as nature takes its course). Maintenance in the form of simple visible inspection and removal of larger rooting plants has allowed these roofs to be successful in that they provide an excellent covering and UV light barrier for the roof waterproofing membrane. With some systems, the manufacturer requires that a root barrier membrane be laid above the waterproofing membrane. If well planned and fitted, the mass of the soil or growth medium can provide a good heat buffer for the building – storing the heat of the sun and releasing it into the building at night and thus keeping inside temperatures more even. Sudden cold spells are also buffered from the building.

One predicted problem with large green roofs is that fire may be able to spread rapidly across areas of dry grasses and plants when they are dried, for instance, in summer by hot weather: Various countries are stipulating fire barrier areas made of, for example, wide strips of (partly decorative) gravel.

[[Sedum]] is emerging as a favourite as it is easily transported and requires little maintenance as it is a succulent plant which remains close to the ground throughout its growth, has mild roots which don't damage the waterproofing membrane and changes colour in the seasons in greens, browns and purples to give a pleasing effect to the eye.

===Green-roof water buffering===
Water run-off and flash floods have become a problem especially in areas where there is a large amount of paving such as in inner cities: When rain falls (instead of draining into the ground over a large area as previously) a rainwater system's pipes take water run-off from huge areas of paving, road surfaces and roof areas – as areas become more and more built up these systems cope less and less well until even a rain-shower can produce backing up of water from pipes which can't remove the large water volume and flooding occurs. By buffering rainfall, such as by fitting green roofs, floods can be reduced or avoided: the rain is absorbed into the soil/roof medium and runs off the roof bit by bit as the roof becomes soaked.

===Roof decks===
A modern (since the 1960s) development in the construction of decks, including flat roof decks, especially when used as living area or the roof of a commercial structure is to build a [[Composite construction#Composite Steel Deck|composite steel deck]].&lt;ref&gt;Lembeck, Henry G..  "Composite Design of Open Web Steel Joists". Washington University Department of Civil Engineering, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flat roof statistics===
Flat roofs can be installed from 10 to 50 year product systems, depending on product and installation process.

==Types of flat roof coverings==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2014}}

===Asphalt===
[[Asphalt]] is an [[aliphatic compound]] and in almost all cases a byproduct of the oil industry. Some asphalt is manufactured from oil as the intended purpose, and this is limited to high-quality asphalt produced for longer lasting asphalt built-up roofs (BUR). Asphalt ages through photo-oxidation accelerated by heat. As it ages, the asphalts melt point rises and there is a loss of plasticizers. As mass is lost, the asphalt shrinks and forms a surface similar to alligator skin. Asphalt breaks down slowly in water, and the more exposure the more rapid the degradation. Asphalt also dissolves readily when exposed to oils and some solvents.

There are four types of roofing asphalt. Each type is created by heating and blowing with oxygen. The longer the process the higher the melt-point of the asphalt.  Therefore, Type I asphalt has characteristics closest to coal tar and can only be used on dead level surfaces. Type II, is considered flat and can be applied to surfaces up to 1/4 in 12 slopes.  Type III, is considered to be "steep" asphalt but is limited to slopes up to 2 in 12, and Type IV is "special steep".  The drawback is, the longer it is processed, the shorter the life.  Dead level roofs where Type I asphalt was used as the flood and gravel adhesive has performed nearly as well as coal tar.
Asphalt roofs are also sustainable by restoring the life cycle by making repairs and recoating with compatible products. The process can be repeated as necessary at a significant cost savings with very little impact on the environment.

Asphalt BUR is made up of multiple layers of reinforcing plies and asphalt forming a redundancy of waterproofing layers. The reflectivity of built up roofs depends on the surfacing material used. Gravel is the most common and they are referred to as asphalt and gravel roofs. Asphalt degradation is a growing concern. UV-rays oxidize the surface of the asphalt and produce a chalk-like residue. As plasticizers leach out of the asphalt, asphalt built-up roofs become brittle. Cracking and alligatoring inevitably follows, allowing water to penetrate the system causing blisters, cracks and leaks.  Compared to other systems, installation of asphalt roofs is energy-intensive (hot processes typically use LP gas as the heat source), and contributes to atmospheric air pollution (toxic, and green-house gases are lost from the asphalt during installation).

===EPDM===
[[Ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber]] (EPDM) is a [[synthetic rubber]] most commonly used in single-ply roofing because it is readily available and simple to apply. Seaming and detailing has evolved over the years and is fast, simple and reliable with many membranes including factory applied tape, resulting in a faster installation. The addition of these tapes has reduced labour by as much as 75%.

It is a low-cost membrane, but when properly applied in appropriate places, its warranted life-span has reached 30 years and its expected lifespan has reached 50 years.

There are three installation methods: ballasted, mechanically attached, and fully adhered. Ballasted roofs are held in place by large round stones or slabs. Mechanically attached roof membranes are held in place with nails and are suitable in some applications where wind velocities are not usually high. A drawback is that the nails penetrate the waterproof membrane; if correctly fastened the membrane is "self-gasketing" and will not leak. Fully adhered installation methods prove to give the longest performance of the three methods.

The most advanced EPDM has been combined with a polyester fleece backing and fabricated with a patented [[hot-melt adhesive]] technology which provides consistent bond strength between the fleece backing and the membrane. This has resulted in largely eliminating shrinkage of the product, whilst still allowing it to stretch up to 300% and move with the building through the seasons. The fleece improves puncture and tear resistance considerably; {{Convert|45|mil|mm|adj=on}} EPDM with a fleece backing is 180% stronger than {{Convert|60|mil|mm|adj=on}} bare EPDM. Fleece backed EPDM has a tear strength of {{convert|39.9|kN/m|abbr=on}} compared to {{convert|13.1|kN/m|abbr=on}} of that without the fleece reinforcement, more than 3 times the strength of non-reinforced membranes.

This thermoset polymer is known for long-term weathering ability and can withstand fluctuations in temperature and ultraviolet rays. They can also be great energy savers.

===Turbo seal===
[[Turbo seal]] is a self-healing gel-like membrane that never cures.  Made of 45% recycled tire rubber, it goes on top of existing tar (asphalt) roofs then capped with a sheet membrane.

===CSPE===
Chlorosulfonated Polyethylene is a synthetic rubber roofing material. It is more popularly known as [[Hypalon]]. The product is usually reinforced and depending upon manufacturer, seams can be heat welded or adhered with a solvent-based adhesive. (No longer available in the US as a full roof membrane.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buildings.com/article-details/articleid/10506/title/where-is-hypalon-among-today-s-roofing-options-|title=Where Is Hypalon Among Today's Roofing Options?|website=www.buildings.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modified bitumen===
A [[bitumen]] is a term applied to both coal tar pitch and asphalt products. Modified Bitumens were developed in Europe in the 1970s when Europeans became concerned with the lower performance standards of roofing asphalt.  Modifiers were added to replace the plasticizers that had been removed by advanced methods in the distillation process.  The two most common modifiers are APP (atactic polypropylene) from Italy and SBS (styrene-butadiene-styrene) from France. The United States started developing modified bitumen compounds in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

APP was added to asphalt to enhance aging characteristics and was applied to polyester, fiberglass, or polyester and fiberglass membranes to form a sheet good, cut in manageable lengths for handling.  Usually applied by heating up the underside of the roll with a torch provided a significant fire hazard and was outlawed in some municipalities when buildings caught fire and some burnt to the ground.  Another problem developed when a lack of standards allowed some manufacturers to produce goods with amounts of APP insufficient to enhance the aging characteristics.

SBS is used as a modifier for enhancing substandard asphalt and provides a degree of flexibility much like rubber.  It also is applied to a myriad of carriers and produced as a sheet-good in rolls that can be easily handled.

SEBS (styrene ethylene butadiene styrene) is a formulation increasing flexibility of the sheet and longevity.

SIS (styrene-isoprene-styrene) is another modifier used commercially. SIS-modified bitumen is rarely used, is used primarily in self-adhering sheets, and has very small market share.  

Modified bitumen membranes are hybrids that combine the high technology formulation and prefabrication benefits of single-ply with traditional roofing installation techniques that are used in built-up roofing. These membranes are factory-fabricated layers of asphalt that are modified using a plastic or rubber ingredient and are combined with a reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wbdg.org/guides-specifications/building-envelope-design-guide/roofing-systems|title=Roofing Systems {{!}} WBDG Whole Building Design Guide|website=wbdg.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold applied liquid membranes===

A choice for new roofs and roof refurbishment. This type of a roof membrane is generally referred to as [[Liquid Roofing]] and involves the application of a cold liquid [[roof coating]]. No open flames or other heat sources are needed and the glass fiber reinforced systems provide seamless waterproofing around roof protrusions and details. Systems are based on flexible thermoset resin systems such as polyester and polyurethane, and poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA). In the United Kingdom, liquid coatings are the fastest growing sector of the flat roof refurbishment market. Between 2005 and 2009 the UK's leading manufacturers have reported a 70% increase in the roof area covered by the coating systems supplied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Market for liquid applied membranes|url=http://www.lrwa.org.uk/Liquid--The-Market|work=Liquid – the market|publisher=Liquid Roofing &amp; Waterproofing Association|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cold applied liquid rubber offers similar benefits to thermoset resin systems with the added benefit of being quick to apply and having high elasticity.  Although it is comparatively new to the UK market it has been used successfully in the US market for 20 years.

===PVC (vinyl) membrane roofing===
Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) membrane roofing is also known as vinyl roofing. Vinyl is derived from two simple ingredients: fossil fuel and salt. Petroleum or natural gas is processed to make ethylene, and salt is subjected to electrolysis to separate out the natural element chlorine. Ethylene and chlorine are combined to produce ethylene dichloride (EDC), which is further processed into a gas called vinyl chloride monomer (VCM). In the next step, known as polymerization, the VCM molecule forms chains, converting the gas into a fine, white powder – vinyl resin – which becomes the basis for the final process, compounding. In compounding, vinyl resin may be blended with additives such as stabilizers for durability, plasticizers for flexibility and pigments for color.

Thermoplastic is heat-welded seams form a permanent, watertight bond that is stronger than the membrane itself. PVC resin is modified with plasticizers and UV stabilizers, and reinforced with fiberglass non-woven mats or polyester woven scrims, for use as a flexible roofing membrane. PVC is, however, subject to '''plasticizer migration'''. (a process by which the plasticizers migrate out of the sheet causing it to become brittle.)  Thus, a thicker membrane has a larger reservoir of plasticizer to maintain flexibility over its lifespan.  PVC is often blended with other polymers to add to the performance capabilities of the original PVC formulation, such as KEE – Keytone Ethylene Ester.  Such blends are referred to as either a CPA – Copolymer Alloy or a TPA – Tripolymer Alloy.

Vinyl roofs provide an energy-efficient roofing option due to their inherently light coloring. While the surface of a black roof can experience a temperature increase of as much as 90 degrees under the heat of the full sun, a white reflective roof typically increases only 5–14 degrees Celsius (10–25 degrees Fahrenheit).

Vinyl membranes can also be used in waterproofing applications for roofing. This is a common technique used in association with green, or planted, roofs.

===FTPO===
'''Flexible Thermo Polyolefin'''- correct acronym for the product TPO
''"Flexible"-retains flexibility "Thermo"-can be reheated again and again, does not cure". "Polyolefin"-a polymer produced from a simple olefin.'' 
Flexible Thermo Poly-Olefin is the exact physical and chemical name given to the product "TPO" Thermo Plastic Olefin. Although TPO exhibits the positive characteristics of other Thermo Plastics, it does not however have any "plasticizers" added to the product like other Thermoplastics. This mis-categorization made sense when the product was introduced in the early 1990s and was unproven in the industry. TPO was categorized with Thermoplastic membranes that were similar in look and performance but were far from their real chemical and physical characteristics of the TPO membrane. TPO was formulated to fix all the problems associated with other Thermoplastic membranes. Having no plasticizers and chemically being closer to rubber but having better seam, puncture, and tear strength, TPO was touted to be white weldable rubber of the future. From 2007-2012 reported sales of TPO roofing products by all six major U.S. manufacturer's report materials and accessories sales quadrupling all other flat roofing materials. Gross sales of TPO membrane roofing in U.S. exceeds all other flat roof types combined. TPO's rapid market acceptance over the last twenty years by contractors, architects, engineers, and the market in general shows it is living up to its original purpose and it's here to stay.

TPO is also being touted as the green solution as it is safer for installers and recycles 100% without chemical byproduct.

Flexible Thermo Polyolefin will soon replace the Thermo Plastic Polyolefin as the correct abbreviation for the TPO membrane roofing category.

===TPO===
Thermoplastic Polyolefin single-ply roofing.  This roofing material can be fully adhered, mechanically fastened, or ballasted.  TPO seam strengths are reported to be three to four times higher than EPDM roofing systems.  This is a popular choice for "Green" building as there  are no plasticizers added and TPO does not degrade under UV radiation.  It is available in white, grey, and black. Using white roof material helps reduce the "heat island effect" and solar heat gain in the building. 

&lt;!-- Merged from built-up-roof:
A Built Up Roof  (BUR), generally consists of two or more layers of roofing felts laminated together using hot or cold asphalt or hot coal tar pitch as an adhesive. Built Up - meaning to "build" upon each other - The layered materials which are referred to as "plys" and are often covered with a heavy coating of asphalt or tar into which a layer of gravel is spread. The gravel surface serves several purposes; Protection from the sun's UV rays and protection from damage caused by roof traffic are the two most important benefits. Built-up roofs are desirable when heavy roof traffic or spilled contaminants are to be expected. --&gt;

===Coal-tar pitch built up roof===

''Coal tar pitch'' is a carcinogen, forbidden by code in some areas.  When installing and patching existing coal tar roofs, worker and building occupant exposure should be avoided, or minimized.  Coal Tar fumes are hazardous and provisions must be made during the application to prevent fumes from getting into the building.  Workers should wear protective equipment and clothing, and commonly get higher compensation (pitch pay) for exposure to the health risks.

[[Coal tar]] is an aromatic hydrocarbon and a by-product from the coking process of the coal industry. It is historically in abundance where coal is used in steel manufacturing. It ages very slowly through volatilization and is an excellent waterproofing and oil resistant product. Roofs are covered by heating the coal tar and applying it between layers of [[tar paper]]. It has limitations in regards to its  application on dead level or flat roofs with slopes less than 1/4 in 12. It has a tendency to soften in warm temperatures and "heal" itself. It is typically ballasted with gravel to provide a walking surface, however a mineral surface membrane is available. Coal tar provides an extremely long life cycle that is sustainable and renewable. It takes energy to manufacture and to construct a roof with it but its proven longevity with periodic maintenance provides service for many years, with ages from 50 to 70 years not uncommon, with some now performing for over a century. Currently, there are cold process (no kettle is used) coal tar pitch products that almost eliminate all fumes associated with its typical hot process version.

Coal tar pitch is often confused with [[asphalt]] and asphalt with coal tar pitch. Although they are both black and both are melted in a kettle when used in roofing, that is where the similarity stops.

===GRP roof – fiberglass===
[[File:GRP fibreglass flat roofing Halifax.jpg|thumb|GRP fiberglass flat roofing]]

A GRP roof is a single-ply GRP laminate applied in situ over a good quality conditioned plywood or OSB deck. The roof is finished with pre-formed GRP edge trims and a coat of pre-pigmented topcoat.

The durability and lightweight properties of GRP make it the ideal construction material for applications as diverse as lorry aerofoils and roofs, boats, ponds and automotive body panels.  GRP is also used in hostile industrial settings for applications such as tanks and underground pipes; this is due to its ability to withstand high temperatures and its resistance to chemicals.

Unlike other roofing materials, GRP is not really a roofing material and has properties that render it better suited to small craft construction. It is often used on small domestic installations, but usually fails prematurely when used on larger scale projects. As well as being an inexpensive material, it is robust, inflexible and will never
corrode.

=== Metal flat roofing ===
Metal is one of the few materials that can be used for both pitched roofs and flat roofs. Flat or low-slope roofs can be covered with steel, aluminum, zinc, or copper just like pitched roofs. However, metal shingles are not practical for flat roofing and so roofers recommend standing-seam and screw-down metal panels. While metal can be an expensive option in the short term, superior durability and simple maintenance of metal roofs typically saves money in the long term. A study by Ducker International in 2005 identified the average cost per year of a metal roof to be 30 cents/square foot while single-ply roofs stood at 57 cents and built-up roofing at 37 cents. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.metalconstruction.org/low_slope_roof&lt;/ref&gt; Metal roofs are also one of the most environmentally sound roofing options, with most metal roofing material already containing 30-60% recycled content, and the product itself being 100% recyclable. The value of recyclable scrap metal can also provide a benefit to the homeowner; upon roof replacement, scrap metal from the old roof can be sold to recoup a potentially large share of original material costs.

==Benefits and uses==
[[File:Roof top in Haikou, Hainan, China - 01.jpg|thumb|right|A rooftop in Haikou, Hainan, China, being used as a garden, storage area for wood, chicken run, and barbecue area]]
A flat roof is the most cost-efficient roof shape as all room space can be used fully (below and above the roof). Having a smaller surface area, flat roofs require less material and are usually stronger than pitched roofs. This style roof also provides ample space for [[solar panel]]s or outdoor recreational use such as [[roof garden]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norwood|first1=Graham|title=Gardens go skywards... If you’ve got a flat roof, turn it into an attractive green space and see your investment grow|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/gardening/article-1383038/Gardens-skywards--If-ve-got-flat-roof-turn-attractive-green-space-investment-grow.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=21 August 2014|location=United Kingdom|date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applying a tough [[waterproofing]] membrane forms the ideal substrate for [[green roof]] planting schemes.

Where gable roofs are uncommon or space is limited, flat roofs may be used as living spaces, with sheltered kitchens, bathrooms, living and sleeping areas. In third world countries, such roof tops are commonly used as areas to dry laundry, for storage, and even as a place to raise livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reel|first1=Monte|title=Up on the Roof|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/specials/favelas/rooftop.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=21 August 2014|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses include [[pigeon coop]]s, [[helipad]]s, sports areas (such as tennis courts), and restaurants outdoor seating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murano|first1=Grace|title=10 Coolest Rooftop Attractions|url=http://www.oddee.com/item_97945.aspx|publisher=Oddee|accessdate=21 August 2014|date=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maintenance and assessment ==
A flat roof lasts longer if it is properly [[Preventive maintenance|maintained]]. Some assessors use 10 years as an average life cycle, although this is dependent on the type of flat roof system in place. Some old [[tar]] and [[gravel]] roofers acknowledge that unless a roof has been neglected for too long and there are many problems in many areas, a BUR (a built up roof of tar, paper and gravel) will last 20–30 years.  There are BUR systems in place dating to the early 1900s.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Modern cold applied liquid membranes have been durability rated by the British Board of Agreement (BBA) for 30 years. BBA approval is a benchmark in determining the suitability of a particular fiberglass roofing system. If standard fiberglass [[polyester]] resin is used such as the same resin used in boat repairs, then there will be problems with the roof being too inflexible and not able to accommodate expansion and contraction of the building. A fit-for-purpose flexible/elastomeric resin system used as a waterproofing membrane will last for many years with just occasional inspection needed. The fact that such membranes do not require stone chippings to deflect heat means there is no risk of stones blocking drains. Liquid applied membranes are also naturally resistant to moss and lichen.

General flat roof maintenance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Guide to Home Maintenance - Flat Roofs|url=http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/DocumentLibrary/housing/Leaflets/improvement/FlatRoof.pdf|publisher=Gateshead.gov.uk|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  includes getting rid of [[ponding]] water, typically within 48 hours. This is accomplished by adding roof drains or scuppers for a pond at an edge or automatic [[siphon]]s for ponds in the center of roofs. An automatic siphon can be created with an inverted ring-shaped [[irrigation sprinkler|sprinkler]], a [[garden hose]], a [[wet/dry vacuum]], a [[check valve]] installed in the vacuum, and a digital timer. The timer runs two or three times a day for a minute or two to start water in the hose. The timer then turns off the vacuum, but the weight of water in the hose continues the siphon and soon opens the check valve in the vacuum. The best time to address the issue of [[ponding]] water is during the design phase of a new roofing project when sufficient falls can be designed-in to take standing water away.  The quicker the water is got off the roof, the less chance there is for a roof leak to occur.

All roofs should be inspected semi-annually and after major storms. Particular attention should be paid to the flashings around all of the rooftop penetrations. The sharp bends at such places can open up and need to be sealed with plastic cement, [[mesh]] and a small mason's [[trowel]].  Additionally, repairs to lap seams in the base [[flashing (weatherproofing)|flashing]]s should be made.  90% of all roof leaks and failure occur at the flashings.  Another important maintenance item, often neglected, is to simply keep the roof drains free of debris.  A clogged roof drain will cause water to pond, leading to increased "dead load" weight on building that may not be [[engineering|engineered]] to accommodate that weight.  Additionally, ponding water on a roof can freeze.  Often, water finds its way into a flashing seam and freezes, weakening the seam.

For bitumen-based roof coverings maintenance also includes keeping the [[tar paper]] covered with gravel, an older method, currently being replaced with [[bituminous]] roofing membranes and the like, which must be 'glued' in place so [[wind]] and waves do not move it causing scouring and more bare spots. The [[glue]] can be any exterior grade glue like driveway coating.

Maintenance also includes fixing [[blister]]s (delaminations) or creases that may not yet be leaking but will leak over time. They may need experienced help as they require scraping away the gravel on a cool morning when the tar is brittle, cutting open, and covering with plastic cement or [[Mastic (filler compound)|mastic]] and mesh. Any moisture trapped in a blister has to be dried before being repaired.

[[Roof coating]]s can be used to fix leaks and extend the life of all types of flat roofs by preventing degradation by the sun (ultra-violet radiation). A thickness of 30 dry mils is usually preferred and once it is fully cured, you will have a seamless, watertight membrane.
 
[[Infrared thermography]] is being used to take pictures of roofs at night to find trouble spots. When the roof is cooling, wet spots not visible to the naked eye, continue to emit heat. The infrared cameras read the heat that is trapped in sections of wet insulation.

== Cool roofs ==
{{main|Cool roof}}
Roofing systems that can deliver high [[albedo|solar reflectance]] (the ability to reflect the visible, [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths of the sun, reducing heat transfer to the building) and high [[thermal emittance]] (the ability to release a large percentage of absorbed, or non-reflected [[solar energy]]) are called cool roofs. Cool roofs fall into one of these three categories: inherently cool, green planted roofs or coated with a cool material.  
* Inherently cool roofs: Roof membranes made of white or light colored material are inherently reflective and achieve some of the highest reflectance and emittance measurements of which roofing materials are capable. A roof made of thermoplastic white vinyl, for example, can reflect 80% or more of the sun's rays and emit at least 70% of the solar radiation that the building absorbs. An asphalt roof only reflects between 6 and 26% of solar radiation, resulting in greater heat transfer to the building interior and greater demand for air conditioning – a strain on both operating costs and the electric power grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Konopacki and H. Akbari |title=Measured Energy Savings and Demand Reduction from a Reflective Roof Membrane on a Large Retail Store in Austin |date=June 2001 |publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Environmental Energy Technologies Division |url=http://vinylroofs.org/casestudy/lbnl/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Green planted roofs: A green roof is a roof that is partially or completely covered with vegetation and a growing medium, planted over a waterproofing membrane. A green roof typically consists of many layers, including an insulation layer; a waterproof membrane, often vinyl; a drainage layer, usually made of lightweight gravel, clay, or plastic; a geotextile or filter mat that allows water to soak through but prevents erosion of fine soil particles; a growing medium; plants; and, sometimes, a wind blanket. Green roofs are classified as either intensive or extensive, depending on the depth of planting medium and amount of maintenance required. Traditional roof gardens, which are labor-intensive and require a reasonable depth of soil to grow large plants are considered intensive, while extensive green roofs are nearly self-sustaining and require less maintenance.
* Coated roofs: One way to make an existing or new roof reflective is by applying a specifically designed white roof coatings (not simply white paint) on the roof's surface. The coating must be Energy Star rated. Reflectivity and emissivity ratings for reflective roof products available in the United States can be found in the Cool Roof Rating Council website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coolroofs.org/index.html |title=Cool Roof Rating Council |accessdate=13 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cool roofs offer both immediate and long-term savings in building energy costs. Inherently cool roofs, coated roofs and planted or green roofs can:
*Reduce building heat-gain, as a white or reflective roof typically increases only 5–14&amp;nbsp;°C (10–25&amp;nbsp;°F) above ambient temperature during the day
*Enhance the life expectancy of both the roof membrane and the building's cooling equipment.
*Improve thermal efficiency of the roof insulation; this is because as temperature increases, the thermal conductivity of the roof's insulation also increases.
*Reduce the demand for electric power by as much as 10 percent on hot days.
*Reduce resulting air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
*Provide energy savings, even in northern climates on sunny (not necessarily "hot") days.

'''Food and biological process engineering''' is a discipline concerned with applying principles of engineering to the fields of food production and distribution and biology. It is a broad field, with workers fulfilling a variety of roles ranging from design of food processing equipment to genetic modification of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://study.com/articles/Become_a_Food_Process_Engineer_Education_and_Career_Roadmap.html|title=Become a Food Process Engineer: Education and Career Roadmap|work=Study.com|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bee.cals.cornell.edu/research/biological-engineering|title=Biological Engineering {{!}} Department of Biological and Environmental Engineering|website=bee.cals.cornell.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some respects it is a combined field, drawing from the disciplines of [[food science]] and [[biological engineering]] to improve the [[earth]]'s food supply.

Creating, processing, and storing food to support the world's population requires extensive interdisciplinary knowledge. Notably, there are many [[biological engineering]] processes within [[food engineering]] to manipulate the multitude of organisms involved in our complex food chain. [[Food safety]] in particular requires biological study to understand the [[microorganisms]] involved and how they affect humans. However, other aspects of food engineering, such as food storage and processing, also require extensive biological knowledge of both the food and the microorganisms that inhabit it. This [[food microbiology]] and [[biology]] knowledge becomes biological engineering when systems and processes are created to maintain desirable food properties and microorganisms while providing mechanisms for eliminating the unfavorable or dangerous ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bee.cals.cornell.edu/research/biological-engineering|title=Biological Engineering {{!}} Department of Biological and Environmental Engineering|website=bee.cals.cornell.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts ==
Many different concepts are involved in the field of food and biological process engineering. Below are listed several major ones.

=== Food science ===
{{Main|food science}}

The science behind food and food production involves studying how food behaves and how it can be improved. Researchers analyze longevity and composition (i.e., ingredients, vitamins, minerals, etc.) of foods, as well as how to ensure food safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes191012.htm|title=Food Scientists and Technologists|website=www.bls.gov|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetic engineering ===
{{Main|Genetic engineering}}

Modern food and biological process engineering relies heavily on applications of genetic manipulation. By understanding plants and animals on the molecular level, scientists are able to engineer them with specific goals in mind.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

Among the most notable applications of such genetic engineering is the creation of disease or insect resistant plants, such as those modified to produce [[Bacillus thuringiensis]], a bacterium that kills strain-specific varieties of insect upon consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aces.uiuc.edu/vista/html_pubs/biotech/insect.htm|title=Insect-resistant Crops Through Genetic Engineering|website=www.aces.uiuc.edu|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, insects are able to adapt to [[Bacillus thuringiensis]] strains, necessitating continued research to maintain disease-resistance.

Additionally, the hurdle effect of food preservation, such as by adding lactic acid bacteria and salt to a food product, is illustrated and described.]]
An important task within the realm of [[food safety]] is the elimination of microorganisms responsible for food-borne illness. Food and waterborne diseases still pose a serious health concern, with hundreds of outbreaks reported per year since 1971 in the United States alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6254a7.htm|title=Foodborne and Waterborne Disease Outbreaks — United States, 1971–2012|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of these diseases has risen throughout the years, mainly due to the mishandling of raw food, poor sanitation, and poor socioeconomic conditions. In addition to diseases caused by direct infection by pathogens, some food borne diseases are caused by the presence of toxins produced by microorganisms in food. There are five main types of microbial pathogens which contaminate food and water: [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], [[Fungus|fungi]], pathogenic [[protozoa]] and [[helminths]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Molecular+Techniques+in+Food+Biology:+Safety,+Biotechnology,+Authenticity+and+Traceability-p-9781119374602|title=Molecular Techniques in Food Biology: Safety, Biotechnology, Authenticity and Traceability|date=2018-03-12|website=Wiley.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several bacteria, such as [[E. coli]], [[Clostridium botulinum]], and [[Salmonella enterica]], are well-known and are targeted for elimination via various industrial processes. Though bacteria are often the focus of food safety processes, viruses, protozoa, and molds are also known to cause food-borne illness and are of concern when designing processes to ensure food safety. Although the goal of food safety is to eliminate harmful organisms from food and prevent food-borne illness, detecting said organisms is another important function of food safety mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramaswamy|first1=Raghupathy|last2=Ahn|first2=Juhee|last3=Balasubramaniam|first3=V.M.|last4=Saona|first4=Luis Rodriguez|last5=Yousef|first5=Ahmed E.|title=Handbook of Farm, Dairy and Food Machinery Engineering (Second Edition)|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123858818000033|website=ScienceDirect|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Institute| first1=of Food Technologies (IFT)|title=Kinetics of Microbial Inactivation for Alternative Food Processing Technologies|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM545175.pdf|publisher=FDA/IFT|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monitoring and detection ===
The goal of most monitoring and detection processes is the rapid detection of harmful microorganisms with minimal interruption to the processing of food products. An example of a detection mechanism that relies heavily on biological processes is usage of chromogenic microbiological media.

==== Chromogenic Microbiological Media ====
Chromogenic microbiological media use colored enzymes to detect the presence of certain bacteria. In conventional bacteria culturing, bacteria are allowed to grow on a medium that supports many strains. Since it is hard to isolate bacteria, many cultures of different bacteria are able to form. To identify a particular bacteria culture, scientists must identify it using only its physical characteristics. Then further tests can be performed to confirm the presence of the bacteria, such as [[serological|serology]] tests that find antibodies formed in organisms as a response to infection.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perry|first=J.D.|last2=Freydière|first2=A.M.|title=The application of chromogenic media in clinical microbiology|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2007.03442.x|journal=Journal of Applied Microbiology|volume=103|issue=6|pages=2046–2055|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2672.2007.03442.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, chromogenic microbiological media use particular color-producing enzymes that are targeted for metabolism by a certain strain of bacteria. Thus, if the given cultures are present, the media will become colored accordingly as the bacteria metabolize the color-producing enzyme. This greatly facilitates the identification of certain bacteria cultures and can eliminate need for further testing. To guard against misidentification of bacteria, the chromogenic plates typically incorporate additional enzymes that will be processed by other bacteria. Now, as the non-target bacteria interact with the additional enzymes, they will produce colors that distinguish them from the target bacteria.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.condalab.com/pdf/Bahar_casestudy.pdf|title=An Article on Chromogenic Media|last=Vosough|first=Massoud|date=2010|website=Conda News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanisms ===
Food safety has been practiced for thousands of years, but with the rise of heavily industrial agriculture, the demand for food safety has steadily increased, prompting more research into the ways to achieve greater food safety. A primary mechanism that will be discussed in this article is heating of food products to kill microorganisms, as this has a millennia-long history and is still extensively used. However, more recent mechanisms have been created such as application of ultraviolet light, usage of [[ozone]], and irradiation of food.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM545175.pdf|title=Kinetics of Microbial Inactivation for Alternative Food Processing Technologies|last=Institiute of Food Technology|first=|date=June 2, 2000|website=FDA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Heating ====

A report given to the [[Food and Drug Administration]] by the [[Institute of Food Technologists]] thoroughly discusses the thermal processing of food.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A notable step in development of heat application to food processing is [[pasteurization]], developed by Louis Pasteur in the nineteenth century. Pasteurization is used to kill microorganisms that could pose risks to consumers or shorten the shelf life of food products. Primarily applied to liquid food products, pasteurization is regularly applied to fruit juice, beer, milk, and ice cream. Heat applied during pasteurization varies from around 60&amp;nbsp;°C to kill bacteria to around 80&amp;nbsp;°C to kill yeasts. Most pasteurization processes have been optimized recently to involve several steps of heating at various temperatures and minimize the time needed for the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Food Preservation, Second Edition|last=Rahman|first=M. Shafiur|publisher=CRC Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-57444-606-7|location=http://www.cold.org.gr/library/downloads/Docs/Handbook%20of%20Food%20Preservation.PDF|pages=571–574}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:A discussion of the design of small ammonia compressors (1911) (14779836691).jpg|thumb|Basic drawing of an ammonia compressor. Ammonia compressors are used in many factories to cool food products.]]A more severe food heating mechanism is thermal [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]]. While pasteurization destroys most bacteria and yeast growing in food products, the goal of sterilization is to kill almost all viable organisms found in food products including yeast, mold, bacteria, and spore forming organisms. Done properly, this process will greatly extend the shelf life of food products and can allow them to be stored at room temperature. As detailed in The Handbook of Food Preservation, thermal sterilization typically involves four steps. First, food products are heated to between 110-125&amp;nbsp;°C, and the products are given time for the heat to travel through the material completely. After this, the temperature must be maintained long enough to kill microorganisms before the food product is cooled to prevent cooking. In practice, though complete sterility of food products could be achieved, the intense and extended heating needed to accomplish this could reduce the nutritive value of the food products, thus, only a partial sterilization is performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Food Preservation, Second Edition|last=Rahman|first=M. Shafiur|publisher=CRC Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-57444-606-7|location=http://www.cold.org.gr/library/downloads/Docs/Handbook%20of%20Food%20Preservation.PDF|pages=586–587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Low-Temperature Process ====
Low-temperature processing also plays an essential role in food processing and storage. During this process, microorganisms and enzymes are subjected to low temperatures. Unlike heating, chilling does not destroy the enzymes and microorganisms but simply reduces their activity, which is effective as long as the temperature is maintained. As the temperature is raised, activity will rise again accordingly. It follows that, unlike heating, the effect of preservation by cold is not permanent; hence the importance of maintaining the ''cold chain'' throughout the shelf life of the food product. (Chapter 16 pg, 396) &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ncsu/reader.action?docID=1213924&amp;query=|title=Food Process Engineering and Technology|last=Berk|first=Zeki|date=July 3, 2013|website=ebookcentral.proquest.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that there are two distinct low temperature processes: chilling and freezing. Chilling is the application of temperatures within the range of 0-8&amp;nbsp;°C, while freezing is usually below 18&amp;nbsp;°C. Refrigeration does slow spoilage in food and reduce the risk of bacterial growth, however, it does not improve the quality of the product.

==== Irradiation ====
[[Food irradiation]] is another notable biological engineering process to achieve food safety. Research into the potential utilization of ionizing irradiation for food preservation started in the 1940s as an extension of studies on the effect of radiation on living cells.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The FDA approved usage of ionizing radiation on food products in 1990. This radiation removes electrons from atoms, and these electrons go on to damage the DNA of microorganisms living in the food, killing the microorganisms. Irradiation can be used to pasteurize food products, such as seafood, poultry, and red meat, thus making these food products safer for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramaswamy|first1=Raghupathy|last2=Ahn|first2=Juhee|last3=Balasubramaniam|first3=V.M.|last4=Saona|first4=Luis Rodriguez|last5=Yousef|first5=Ahmed E.|title=Handbook of Farm, Dairy and Food Machinery Engineering (Second Edition)|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123858818000033|website=ScienceDirect|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=30 March 2018 | pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some irradiation is also used to delay fruit ripening processes, which can kill microorganisms that accelerate the ripening and spoilage of produce. Low dosages of radiation can also be used to kill insects living in harvested crops, as the radiation will stunt the insects' development at various stages and damage their ability to reproduce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Food Preservation, Second Edition|last=Rahman|first=M. Shafiur|publisher=CRC Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-57444-606-7|location=http://www.cold.org.gr/library/downloads/Docs/Handbook%20of%20Food%20Preservation.PDF|pages=763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Food storage and preservation ==
[[File:Taylor pork roll slices on pkg.JPG|thumb|Meat that has been gas flushed; a technique used for modified atmosphere packaging.]]Food storage and preservation is a key component of food engineering processes and relies heavily on biological engineering to understand and manipulate the organisms involved. Note that the above food safety processes such as pasteurization and sterilization destroy the microorganisms that also contribute to deterioration of food products while not necessarily posing a risk to people. Understanding of these processes, their effects, and the microorganisms at play in various food processing techniques is a very important biological engineering task within food engineering. Factories and processes must be created to ensure that food products can be processed in an efficient and effective manner, which again relies heavily on biological engineering expertise.

=== Produce ===
Preservation and processing of fresh produce poses many biological engineering challenges. Understanding of biology is particularly important to processing produce because most fruits and vegetables are living organisms from the time of harvest to the time of consumption. Before harvesting, understanding of plant [[ontogeny]], or origin and development, and the manipulation of these developmental processes are key components of the industrial agriculture process. Understanding of plant developmental cycles governs how and when plants are harvested, impacts storage environments, and contributes to creating intervention processes. Even after harvesting, fruits and vegetables undergo the biological processes of respiration, transpiration, and ripening. Control over these natural plant processes should be achieved to prevent food spoilage, sprouting or growth of produce during storage, and reduction in quality or desirability, such as through wilting or loss of desirable texture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Food Preservation, Second Edition|last=Rahman|first=M. Shafiur|publisher=CRC Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-57444-606-7|location=http://www.cold.org.gr/library/downloads/Docs/Handbook%20of%20Food%20Preservation.PDF|pages=19–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology ===
When considering food storage and preservation, the technologies of modified atmosphere and controlled atmosphere are widely used for the storage and packing of several types of foods. They offer several advantages such as delay of ripening and senescence of horticultural commodities, control of some biological processes such as rancidity, insects, bacteria and decay, among others.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crcpress.com/Modified-and-Controlled-Atmospheres-for-the-Storage-Transportation-and/Yahia/p/book/9781420069570|title=Modified and Controlled Atmospheres for the Storage, Transportation, and Packaging of Horticultural Commodities|website=CRC Press|language=en|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Controlled atmosphere]] (CA) storage refers to atmospheres that are different than normal air and strictly controlled at all times.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This type of storage manipulates the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels within airtight stores of containers. [[Modified atmosphere]] (MA) storage refers to any atmosphere different from normal air, typically made by mixing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and N&lt;sub&gt;2.&lt;/sub&gt;

== Waste management ==
Another biological engineering process within food engineering involves the processing of agricultural waste. Though it may fall more within the realm of [[environmental engineering]], understanding how organisms in the environment will respond to the waste products is important for assessing the impact of the processes and comparing waste processing strategies. It is also important to understand which organisms are involved in the decomposition of the waste products, and the byproducts that will be produced as a result of their activity.

To discuss direct application of biological engineering, biological waste processing techniques are used to process organic waste and sometimes create useful byproducts. There are two main processes by which organic matter is processed via microbes: aerobic processes and anaerobic processes. These processes convert organic matter to cell mass through synthesis processes of microorganisms. Aerobic processes occur in the presence of oxygen, take organic matter as input, and produce water, carbon dioxide, nitrate, and new cell mass. Anaerobic processes occur in the absence of oxygen and produce less cell mass than aerobic processes. An additional benefit of anaerobic processes is that they also generate methane, which can be burned as a fuel source. Design of both aerobic and anaerobic biological waste processing plants requires careful control of temperature, humidity, oxygen concentration, and the waste products involved. Understanding of all aspects of the system and how they interact with one another is important for developing efficient waste management plants and falls within the realm of biological engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramaswamy|first1=Raghupathy|last2=Ahn|first2=Juhee|last3=Balasubramaniam|first3=V.M.|last4=Saona|first4=Luis Rodriguez|last5=Yousef|first5=Ahmed E.|title=Handbook of Farm, Dairy and Food Machinery Engineering (Second Edition)|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123858818000033|website=ScienceDirect|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=30 March 2018|pages=619–620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francis Marion University''' (formerly Francis Marion College) is a public [[liberal arts]] [[university]] located six miles (11&amp;nbsp;km) east of [[Florence, South Carolina|Florence]], [[South Carolina]]. It is named in honor of [[American Revolutionary War]] hero [[Brigadier General]] [[Francis Marion]].

==History==
The university dates back to 1957, when the [[University of South Carolina]] set up a freshman college in a basement room of the Florence County Library. A few years later, in 1961, USC-Florence was set up on land donated by the Wallace family six miles east of [[Florence, South Carolina]]. Buoyed by these successes, a group of Florence-area citizens continued to push for the establishment a four-year university in the Florence to allow better access to higher education for the people of that area. The existing USC-F was an obvious foundation for a new institution. After several years of lobbying, Governor [[Robert E. McNair]] signed into law an act creating Francis Marion College, effective July 1, 1970.  The newly created Francis Marion College initially enrolled 907 students from 23 of [[South Carolina]]'s 46 counties.

In 1992, Francis Marion College achieved university status and subsequently changed its name to ''Francis Marion University''. Today, Francis Marion has a student body of approximately 4,000. FMU draws students from across the country and around the world, but remains true to its original mission: to educate the people of the Pee Dee Region and the State of South Carolina. The student body's average in-state enrollment is 95 percent. Just more than half FMU's students come from the Pee Dee Region.

Francis Marion is one of South Carolina's 13 [[public university|state-assisted universities]]. It's academic departments are segmented into three schools (School of Business, School of Education, School of Health Sciences) and the College of Liberal Arts.

Since 1999, Francis Marion University has consistently ranked as one of the South's best regional universities, earning it a spot in ''[[US News and World Reports]]'' America's Best Colleges. FMU was recognized as a Great College to Work For—Honor Roll school by the ''Chronicle for Higher Education'' in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018.

The [[Slave Houses, Gregg Plantation]], located on the FMU campus, were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Located on a {{convert|400|acre|ha|0|adj=on}} tract of land originally included in a [[land grant|grant]] by the [[King of England]] and later made a [[cotton plantation]] by the Wallace Family, Francis Marion University is situated {{convert|6|mi|km}} east of Florence. The [[campus]] includes {{convert|100|acre|ha|0}} of mixed pine-hardwood and bottomland forests accessed by a series of trails. The University is located on U.S. Highways 76 and 301 and is just an hour's drive from [[Myrtle Beach]] and the [[Grand Strand]] and 4 hours from the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]]. With a metropolitan-area population of 200,000, the city of [[Florence]] is nestled alongside [[Interstate 95 in South Carolina|Interstate 95]], the main north-south corridor from the [[New England]] area to [[Miami]], and at the eastern end of [[Interstate 20]]. The city is served by [[Amtrak]], bus service, and a regional airport.

In [[architecture]], '''functionalism''' is the principle that buildings should be designed based solely on the purpose and function of the building. This principle is less self-evident than it first appears, and is a matter of confusion and controversy within the profession, particularly in regard to [[modern architecture]].

The theoretical articulation of functionalism in buildings can be traced back to the [[Vitruvius|Vitruvian]] triad, where 'utilitas' (variously translated as 'commodity', 'convenience', or 'utility') stands alongside 'venustas' (beauty) and 'firmitas' (firmness) as one of three classic goals of architecture. Functionalist views were typical of some [[Gothic Revival architecture|gothic revival]] architects. In particular, [[Augustus Welby Pugin]] wrote that ''"there should be no features about a building which are not necessary for convenience, construction, or propriety"'' and ''"all ornament should consist of enrichment of the essential construction of the building"''.&lt;ref&gt;A.W.N.Pugin, The true principles of pointed or Christian architecture : set forth in two lectures delivered at St. Marie's, Oscott.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate about functionalism and [[aesthetics]] is often framed as a mutually exclusive choice, when in fact there are architects, like [[Will Bruder]], [[James Polshek]] and [[Ken Yeang]], who attempt to satisfy all three Vitruvian goals.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

In the wake of [[World War I]], an international functionalist architecture movement emerged as part of the wave of [[Modernism]]. The ideas were largely inspired by the need to build a new and better world for the people, as broadly and strongly expressed by the social and political movements of Europe after the extremely devastating world war. In this respect, functionalist architecture is often linked with the ideas of [[socialism]] and modern [[humanism]]. A new slight addition to this new wave of functionalism was that not only should buildings and houses be designed around the purpose of functionality, architecture should also be used as a means to physically create a better world and a better life for people in the broadest sense. This new functionalist architecture had the strongest impact in [[Germany]], [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[USSR]] and the [[Netherlands]], and from the 1930s also in [[Scandinavia]] and [[Finland]].

== History of functionalism ==
{{expand section|reason=Needs to include the philosophical, social and political ideas in Functionalism, which are all very prominent and in many cases defining|date=January 2018}}
In 1896, Chicago architect Louis Sullivan coined the phrase 'form ever follows function', however this aphorism does not relate to a contemporary understanding of the term ‘function’ as utility or the satisfaction of user needs; it was instead based in metaphysics, as the expression of organic essence and could be paraphrased as meaning 'destiny'. &lt;ref&gt;Forty, A. ‘Words &amp; Buildings: Function’, pp 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1930s, functionalism began to be discussed as an aesthetic approach rather than a matter of design integrity (use). The idea of functionalism was conflated with lack of ornamentation, which is a different matter. It became a pejorative term associated with the most bald and brutal ways to cover space, like cheap commercial buildings and sheds, then finally used, for example in academic criticism of Buckminster Fuller's geodesic domes, simply as a synonym for 'gauche'.

For 70 years the influential American architect Philip Johnson held that the profession has no functional responsibility whatsoever, and this is one of the many views today. Johnson said, "Where form comes from I don’t know, but it has nothing at all to do with the functional or sociological aspects of our architecture".[2] The position of postmodern architect Peter Eisenman is based on a user-hostile theoretical basis and even more extreme: "I don't do function."{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Modernism ==
{{Main|Modern architecture}}
Popular notions of [[modern architecture]] are heavily influenced by the work of the Franco-Swiss architect [[Le Corbusier]] and the German architect [[Mies van der Rohe]]. Both were functionalists at least to the extent that their buildings were radical simplifications of previous styles. In 1923 Mies van der Rohe was working in [[Weimar culture|Weimar]] Germany, and had begun his career of producing radically simplified, lovingly detailed structures that achieved Sullivan's goal of inherent architectural beauty.  [[Le Corbusier]] famously said "a house is a machine for living in"; his 1923 book ''[[Vers une architecture]]'' was, and still is, very influential, and his early built work such as the [[Villa Savoye]] in [[Poissy]], [[France]], is thought of as prototypically function.

== Czechoslovak Functionalism ==
[[File:Narodni Technicke Museum 2012 01.jpg|thumb|right|National Technical Museum (Prague) 1942 by Milan Babouska]]
Functionalism was a dominant architectonic style in former [[Czechoslovakia]] in the period of 1928-1970 (with an exception of the occupation and a [[Stalinist architecture]] in 1950s). It was a result of fascination first by industrial development and later by an effort "to create a new man and new society" during the period of the socialism (1948–89). Its "program" was formulated by the Club of architects in [[Prague]] in 1924. In 1930s and then in 1960s and 1970s the position of functionalism was dominant and almost exclusive.

== Nordic "funkis" ==
[[File:Kansankatu 47 Oulu 20100321.jpg|thumb|left|Typical railing, flat roof, stucco and colour detail in Nordic funkis (SOK warehouse and offices, Finland)]]
In Scandinavia (including Finland), the international movement and ideas of modernist architecture became widely known among architects at the [[Stockholm Exhibition (1930)|1930 Stockholm Exhibition]], under the guidance of director and Swedish architect [[Gunnar Asplund]]. Enthusiastic architects collected their ideas and inspirations in the manifesto ''[[Acceptera|acceptera!]]'' and in the years thereafter, a functionalist architecture emerged throughout Scandinavia. The genre involves some peculiar features unique to Scandinavia and it is often referred to as "funkis", to distinguish it from functionalism in general. Some of the common features are flat roofing, [[stucco]]ed walls, [[Architectural glass|architectural glazing]] and well-lit rooms, an industrial expression and nautical inspired details, including round windows.&lt;ref&gt;William C Miller (2016): ''Nordic Modernism: Scandinavian Architecture 1890-2017'', The Crowood Press Ltd., {{ISBN|978 1 78500 237 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global stock market crisis and [[1929 economic crisis|economic meltdown in 1929]], instigated the needs to use affordable materials, such as brick and concrete, and to build quickly and efficiently. These needs became another signature of the Nordic version of functionalist architecture, in particular in buildings from the 1930s, and carried over into modernist architecture when industrial serial production became much more prevalent after World War II.&lt;ref name=Connah/&gt;

As most architectural styles, Nordic funkis was international in its scope and several architects designed Nordic funkis buildings throughout the region. Some of the most active architects working internationally with this style, includes [[Edvard Heiberg]], [[Arne Jacobsen]] and [[Alvar Aalto]]. Nordic funkis features prominently in Scandinavian urban architecture, as the need for urban housing and new institutions for the growing [[welfare state]]s exploded after World War II. Funkis had its heyday in the 1930s and 1940s, but functionalist architecture continued to be built long into the 1960s. These later structures, however, tends to be categorized as modernism in a Nordic context.

=== Denmark ===
[[Vilhelm Lauritzen]], [[Arne Jacobsen]] and [[C.F. Møller]] were among the most active and influential Danish architects of the new functionalist ideas and Arne Jacobsen, [[Poul Kjærholm]], [[Kaare Klint]], and others, extended the new approach to design in general, most notably furniture which evolved to become [[Danish modern]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hollingsworth, [[Danish Modern]], 2008, Gibbs Smith, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Danish designers and artists who did not work as architects are sometimes also included in the Danish functionalist movement, such as [[Finn Juhl]], [[Louis Poulsen]] and [[Poul Henningsen]]. In Denmark, bricks were largely preferred over reinforced concrete as construction material, and this included funkis buildings. Apart from institutions and apartment blocks, more than 100,000 single-family funkis houses were built in the years 1925-1945. However, the truly dedicated funkis design was often approached with caution and many residential buildings only included some signature funkis elements such as round windows, corner windows or architectural glazing to signal modernity while not provoking conservative traditionalists too much. This branch of restrained approach to the funkis design created the Danish version of the [[bungalow]] building.&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne Brüel (2014): "''Funkishuset - en bevaringsguide''", {{da icon}} Bygningskultur Danmark&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johan Hage: [https://issuu.com/johanhage/docs/web_funkishuset Funkishuset] {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fine examples of Danish functionalist architecture are the now listed [[Kastrup Airport]] 1939 terminal by Vilhelm Lauritzen, [[Aarhus University]] (by C. F. Møller et al.) and [[Aarhus City Hall]] (by Arne Jacobsen et al.), all including furniture and lamps specially designed in the functionalist spirit. The largest functionalist complex in the Nordic countries is the 30,000 sq. m. residential compound of [[Hostrups Have]] in Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;Niels-Ole Lund (2008): ''Nordic Architecture'', Arkitektens Forlag, {{ISBN|9788774072584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland ===
Some of the most prolific and notable architects in Finland, working in the funkis style, includes Alvar Aalto and [[Erik Bryggman]] who were both engaged from the very start in the 1930s. The [[Turku]] region pioneered this new style and the journal ''[[Arkkitehti]]'' mediated and discussed functionalism in a Finnish context. Many of the first buildings in the funkis style were industrial structures, institutions and offices but spread to other kinds of structures such as residential buildings, individual housing and churches. The functionalist design also spread to interior designs and furnitures as exemplified by the iconic [[Paimio Sanatorium]], designed in 1929 and built in 1933.&lt;ref name=yit&gt;YIT: [https://www.yitgroup.com/en/news-repository/news/functionalism-is-a-finnish-thing Functionalism is a Finnish thing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Connah&gt;{{cite book|title=Finland: Modern Architectures in History|author=Roger Connah|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Finnish Architecture and the Modernist Tradition|author=Malcolm Quantrill|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aalto introduced standardised, precast concrete elements as early as the late 1920s, when he designed residential buildings in Turku. This technique became a cornerstone of later developments in modernist architecture after World War II, especially in the 1950s and 1960s. He also introduced serial produced wooden housing.&lt;ref name=yit/&gt;

===Södra Ängby, Sweden===
The [[residential area]] of [[Södra Ängby]] in western [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], blended a functionalist or [[International style (architecture)|international]] style with [[Garden city movement|garden city]] ideals. Encompassing more than 500 buildings, it remains the largest coherent functionalistic [[villa]] area in Sweden and possibly the world, still well-preserved more than a half-century after its construction 1933–40 and protected as a [[listed buildings in Sweden|national cultural heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;Detailed references listed in the article on [[Södra Ängby]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zlín, Czech Republic===
[[File:Zlin-Areal Svit.JPG|thumb|[[Zlín]] in Czech republic.]]

[[Zlín]] is a city in Czech republic which was in 1930s completely reconstructed on principles of functionalism. In that time the city was a headquarters of  [[Bata Shoes]] company and Tomáš Baťa initiated a complex reconstruction of the city which was inspired by functionalism and the [[Garden city movement]].

Zlín's distinctive architecture was guided by principles that were strictly observed during its whole inter-war development. Its central theme was the derivation of all architectural elements from the factory buildings. The central position of the industrial production in the life of all Zlín inhabitants was to be highlighted. Hence the same building materials (red bricks, glass, reinforced concrete) were used for the construction of all public (and most private) edifices. The common structural element of Zlín architecture is a square bay of 20x20 feet (6.15x6.15 m). Although modified by several variations, this high modernist style leads to a high degree of uniformity of all buildings. It highlights the central and unique idea of an industrial garden city at the same time. Architectural and urban functionalism was to serve the demands of a modern city. The simplicity of its buildings which also translated into its functional adaptability was to prescribe (and also react to) the needs of everyday life.

The urban plan of Zlín was the creation of [[František Lydie Gahura]], a student at Le Corbusier's atelier in Paris. Architectural highlights of the city are e.g. the Villa of Tomáš Baťa, Baťa’s Hospital, The Grand Cinema or [[Baťa's Skyscraper]].

===Khrushchyovka===
{{see also|Khrushchyovka}}
[[Image:Panel Khrushchev house in Tomsk.jpg|thumb|Panel khrushchovka in [[Tomsk]].]]

Khrushchyovka ({{lang-rus|хрущёвка|p=xrʊˈɕːɵfkə}}) is an unofficial name of type of low-cost, concrete-[[Panel building|paneled]] or brick three- to five-storied [[apartment building]] which was developed in the [[Soviet Union]] during the early 1960s, during the time its namesake [[Nikita Khrushchev]] directed the Soviet government. The apartment buildings also went by the name of "Khruschoba" (Хрущёв+трущоба, Khrushchev-slum).

==Functionalism in landscape architecture==

The development of functionalism in [[landscape architecture]] paralleled its development in building architecture. At the residential scale, designers like [[Christopher Tunnard]], [[James C. Rose|James Rose]], and [[Garrett Eckbo]] advocated a design philosophy based on the creation of spaces for outdoor living and the integration of house and garden.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Elizabeth Barlow.  ''Landscape Design: A Cultural and Architectural History''.  New York: Abrams, 2001.  p.23, 454-5&lt;/ref&gt;  At a larger scale, the German landscape architect and planner [[Leberecht Migge]] advocated the use of edible gardens in social housing projects as a way to counteract hunger and increase self-sufficiency of families.  
At a larger scale, the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]] advocated for urban design strategies based on human proportions and in support of four functions of human settlement: housing, work, play, and transport.

'''Industry funding of academic research in the United States''' is one of the two major sources of funding in academia along with government support. Currently, private funding of research accounts for the majority of all research and development funding in the United States as of 2007 overall.&lt;ref name=CBO2007&gt;https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/82xx/doc8221/06-18-research.pdf{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Federal and Industrial sources contribute similar amounts to research, while industry funds the vast majority of development work.&lt;ref name="CBO2007" /&gt; 

While the majority of industry research is performed in-house, a major portion of this private research funding is directed to research in non-profit academic centers.&lt;ref name=NBK215472&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=McGeary |editor2-first=Kathi E. |editor2-last=Hanna |year=2004 |chapter=Sources of Funding for Biomedical Research |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK215472/ |title=Strategies to Leverage Research Funding |isbn=0-309-09277-9 |pages=37–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1999, industrial sources accounted for an estimated $2.2 billion of academic research funding in the US.&lt;ref name=NBK215472/&gt; However, there is little governmental oversight or tracking of industry funding on academic science and figures of the scale of industry research are often estimated by self-reporting and surveys which can be somewhat unreliable.

Much of this industry funding of academic research is directed toward applied research. However, by some accounts, industry may even fund up to 40% of basic research in the United States, with Federal funding of basic research falling below 50%, although this figure does not consider where this research is conducted.&lt;ref name="science.aal0890"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.aal0890 |title=Data check: U.S. Government share of basic research funding falls below 50% |journal=Science |year=2017 |last1=Mervis |first1=Jeffrey }}&lt;/ref&gt; The role for funding of academic research from industrial sources has received much attention both in a historical and contemporary perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.290.1.113 |pmid=12837722 |title=Industry Funding of Clinical Trials: Benefit or Bias? |journal=JAMA |volume=290 |issue=1 |pages=113–4 |year=2003 |last1=Chopra |first1=S. S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice has received both extensive political praise and scholarly criticism.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==History==
Research in the US prior to World War II, heavily relied on funding from private sources without major organized federal research programs or either the scientists’ or associates’ personal funds. During World Wa&lt;s&gt;r&lt;/s&gt; II, governmental investment in research was widely regarded as a major contributor to military success and support for research was politically favorable.&lt;ref name=NBK235736&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK235736/{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following WW2, federal research funding in both Europe and the US increased in terms of relative percent of funding for research and absolute amount.&lt;ref name=NBK235736/&gt; Overall, the growth of industrial research funding has greatly outpaced public research funding growth, with US governmental research funding increasing by an average of 3.4% annually, while industrial research funding increased by an average of 5.4% annually from 1950 to 2004.&lt;ref name=CBO2007/&gt; 

Since WW2, industry funding of science has consistently represented the second largest source of funding for academic science.&lt;ref name=Jahnke&gt;{{cite web |first=Art |last=Jahnke |date=April 6, 2015 |title=Who Picks Up the Tab for Science? |url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2015/funding-for-scientific-research/ |work=BU Today }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry funding of academic science did expand during the 1980s and 1990s following the passing of the Bayh-Dohl Act and a variety of both State and Federal proposals to increase funding for joint industry academic partnerships.&lt;ref name=Cohen1994&gt;{{cite book |first1=Wesley |last1=Cohen |first2=Richard |last2=Florida |first3=W Richard |last3=Goe |title=University-Industry Research Centers in the United States: Final Report to the Ford Foundation |publisher=H. John Heinz III School of Public Policy and Management, Center for Economic Development |year=1994 |oclc=249390310 }}{{page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s there has been a small retraction of industry funding for academic science while overall industry R&amp;D funding has expanded.&lt;ref name=Jahnke/&gt; ). However, industry funding may be broadening its scope as industry funding of basic science increasing dramatically over that same period, but much of this funding remains in-house.&lt;ref name=science.aal0890/&gt;

Culturally, attitudes towards the industrial funding of academic research have changed over time. Within universities, commercial activities and industry funding were often spurned in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/652016 |pmid=20380344 |title=The Professional and the Scientist in Nineteenth-Century America |journal=Isis |volume=100 |issue=4 |pages=699–732 |year=2009 |last1=Lucier |first1=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, commercializing scientific activity is viewed more favorably with extensive political and university support of translating scientific discovery into economic output. However, within the research community and the public, industrial funding of research remains controversial. The universality of this tangled industry, academic, and governmental exchange of funding and research adventures has led researchers to term this model of R&amp;D the Triple Helix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(99)00055-4 |title=The dynamics of innovation: From National Systems and 'Mode 2' to a Triple Helix of university–industry–government relations |journal=Research Policy |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=109–23 |year=2000 |last1=Etzkowitz |first1=Henry |last2=Leydesdorff |first2=Loet }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of industrially funded academic research ==
University-industry partnerships can take on a variety of forms. On the smallest scale, individual research labs or researchers can partner with industry sources for funding. The details of such partnerships can differ substantially with any number of motives ranging from the academic lab testing of previously developed products, to performing early stage basic research related to industry research objectives, or even to individual researchers supporting their salary by consulting on related research problems in industry.&lt;ref name=Lucier2008&gt;https://muse.jhu.edu/book/3500{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many such partnerships exist, due to their informal nature and resulting lack of record, it is difficult to track how extensive and impactful such relationships are, with most relying on surveys and other self-reporting measures. By closest approximation, according to the Research Value Mapping Survey, 17% of academics at major US research universities report receive grants from industry sources supporting their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.respol.2007.01.007 |title=Impacts of grants and contracts on academic researchers' interactions with industry |journal=Research Policy |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=694–707 |year=2007 |last1=Bozeman |first1=Barry |last2=Gaughan |first2=Monica }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Far more extensively, in many fields and countries, a narrow majority of academic scientists report having some soft industry relationships, primarily through consulting.&lt;ref name="Perkmann2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.respol.2012.09.007 |title=Academic engagement and commercialisation: A review of the literature on university–industry relations |journal=Research Policy |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=423–42 |year=2013 |last1=Perkmann |first1=Markus |last2=Tartari |first2=Valentina |last3=McKelvey |first3=Maureen |last4=Autio |first4=Erkko |last5=Broström |first5=Anders |last6=d'Este |first6=Pablo |last7=Fini |first7=Riccardo |last8=Geuna |first8=Aldo |last9=Grimaldi |first9=Rosa |last10=Hughes |first10=Alan |last11=Krabel |first11=Stefan |last12=Kitson |first12=Michael |last13=Llerena |first13=Patrick |last14=Lissoni |first14=Franceso |last15=Salter |first15=Ammon |last16=Sobrero |first16=Maurizio }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.28.6.1814 |pmid=19887423 |pmc=3767010 |title=Participation of Academic Scientists in Relationships with Industry |journal=Health Affairs |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=1814–25 |year=2009 |last1=Zinner |first1=D. E |last2=Bolcic-Jankovic |first2=D |last3=Clarridge |first3=B |last4=Blumenthal |first4=D |last5=Campbell |first5=E. G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such informal industry academic relationships have a long-standing tradition as they served as a major source of funding for individual labs prior to WW2. In many cases, it was expected that researchers would pursue such relationships as this was expected to be a major source of funding for researcher’s salaries.&lt;ref name="Lucier2008" /&gt; Despite greatly expanded post-WW2 federal support for research, so called soft money salary support from industry remains a large and growing aspect of academic research salaries.&lt;ref name="Perkmann2013" /&gt;

=== University Industry Research Centers (UIRCs) ===
On a larger scale, there have been numerous attempts to create collaborative University-Industry Research Centers (UIRCs) to jointly host academic and industry researchers to address industry problems with direct, large scale collaborative centers. Early forms of UIRCS started in the 1950s and 1960s with the formation of research parks with industry sponsors. In the 1970s, there were multiple proposals at the federal level in the US to help fund and expand early UIRCs. However, funding fell through at multiple points.&lt;ref name="Berman2012"&gt;https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9619.html{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first UIRCs experienced difficulties in bridging the differences between academic and industrial culture. One such attempt occurred at Cal Tech where Cal Tech researchers partnered with Xerox and IBM through the Silicon Structures Project.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/capsca_000202
{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both industry and academic partners were concerned about the cultures of the other and found the structure ineffective.&lt;ref name="Perkmann2013" /&gt; With such frustrations, it was difficult to secure partners to continue expanding UIRCs.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In the late 1970s, RPI created two three new UIRCs: 1) the Center for Integrated Computer Graphics, which received both NSF and industry support 2) the Center for Manufacturing Productivity and Technology Transfer, which was funded entirely by industry support and 3) the Center for Integrated Electronics, which received unprecedented industry support.&lt;ref name="Berman2012" /&gt; These centers were generally regarded as highly successful and made expansion of governmental support for joint industry and academic ventures more favorable. In the early 1980s, states began contributing funding to UIRCs and other industry-academic partnerships to encourage local economic growth from innovation. By the mid-1980s, the federal government expanded financial support for UIRCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/016224399602100303 |jstor=689710 |title=The Emergence of a Competitiveness Research and Development Policy Coalition and the Commercialization of Academic Science and Technology |journal=Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=303–39 |year=2016 |last1=Slaughter |first1=Sheila |last2=Rhoades |first2=Gary }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With mixed governmental and industry support, the UIRCs were more likely to be successful. Over time successful governmentally funded UIRCs could become independent from government support once having demonstrable successes that could continue to incentivize industry to contribute funding more aggressively.&lt;ref name="Berman2012" /&gt; UIRCs, coupled to early seeding from both state and federal government, continued to greatly expand during the 1980s and early 1990s, eventually receiving nearly 70% of industry funding of academic research and incentivizing a tripling of industry funding of academic research during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Cohen1994" /&gt;

=== Contract Research Organizations (CROs) ===
Contract research has also drawn increasing industry funding, particularly to Contract Research Organizations (CROs) from Biotech and Pharmaceutical corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00136504 |jstor=3446795 |title=Contract research, the university, and the academic |journal=Higher Education |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=665–82 |year=1985 |last1=Crawshaw |first1=Bruce }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contract research is a popular form of outsourcing research in industry as industry has more influence over how the study is conducted than in either UIRCs or traditional academic grants. CROs, which are specifically designed for this function have drawn substantial industry clinical research funding away from academia and are growing rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23424323 |pmc=3571008 |year=2005 |author1=Carroll |first1=J |title=CRO Crowing About Their Growth |journal=Biotechnology healthcare |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=46–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and criticisms==
Much discussion has been placed on the effects of industrial research funding on the behavior of academic research scientists. Concerns center on whether researchers can remain impartial when they are being funded by a for-profit and potentially motivated industrial source, if this funding gives private sources an oversized impact on which research directions are pursued, and the potential negative effects of industrial funding on the openness of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(99)00112-2 |title=Unintended consequences of cooperative research: Impact of industry sponsorship on climate for academic freedom and other graduate student outcome |journal=Research Policy |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=179–99 |year=2001 |last1=Behrens |first1=Teresa R |last2=Gray |first2=Denis O }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A multitude of studies have found that pharmaceutical studies funded by industry organizations are significantly more likely to publish results in favor of the product being supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.01.010 |title=How pharmaceutical industry funding affects trial outcomes: Causal structures and responses |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=66 |issue=9 |pages=1909–14 |year=2008 |last1=Sismondo |first1=Sergio }}&lt;/ref&gt; This could, in part, be due to the fact that usually when an academic accepts industry funding, particularly when working on an existing product, researchers have to sign non-disclosure agreements which often prevent the publication of negative results and inhibit the openness of science.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/04/public-universities-get-an-education-in-private-industry/521379/{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could serve to significantly bias scientific results and diminish public trust of science.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

There are additionally many scholars who have considered advantages of industrially funded academic research. Generally, increased industry funding may increase academic and industry interaction, prompting greater efficiency in translating and commercializing of science research. This increased commercialization activity from academics could serve as an economic and societal boost as the economy could be bolstered by new products hitting the market, while society could benefit directly from having increased access to the fruits of scientific production. Supporting this, academic science funded by industry sources does result in more patents per dollar, increased licensing of these patents, and even more citations per published paper than research supported by other sources, including federal at the University of California Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/507297a |pmid=24654278 |title=Technology transfer: Industry-funded academic inventions boost innovation |journal=Nature |volume=507 |issue=7492 |pages=297–9 |year=2014 |last1=Wright |first1=Brian D |last2=Drivas |first2=Kyriakos |last3=Lei |first3=Zhen |last4=Merrill |first4=Stephen A }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Germany, it also appears that applied research funded by industry sources results in a significant increase in patent citations, which could correspond to a serious increase in translation of applied research.&lt;ref name=Hottenrott2011&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6435.2011.00519.x |title=Industry Funding of University Research and Scientific Productivity |journal=Kyklos |volume=64 |issue=4 |pages=534–55 |year=2011 |last1=Hottenrott |first1=Hanna |last2=Thorwarth |first2=Susanne }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such increase in commercialization and translation of research could provide social and economic benefits.&lt;ref name=Hottenrott2011/&gt; However, it is difficult to determine whether this increase in apparent impact is due to the industry funding itself or is just a read out that industry funds target work that tends to produce more citations per publication as well as more patents.&lt;ref name=Jahnke/&gt;

[[File:Saint Irenaeus.jpg|thumb|236px&lt;!--(approx Sidebar/Infobox)--&gt;|Saint [[Irenaeus]], the second-century philosopher and theologian who inspired the development of the Irenaean theodicy.]]
{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |challenges}}

The '''Irenaean theodicy''' is a Christian [[theodicy]] (a response to the [[problem of evil]]). It defends the probability of an [[omnipotent]] and [[omnibenevolent]] (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God in the face of evidence of evil in the world. Numerous variations of theodicy have been proposed which all maintain that, while evil exists, God is either not responsible for creating evil, or he is not guilty for creating evil. Typically, the Irenaean theodicy asserts that the world is the [[best of all possible worlds]] because it allows humans to fully develop. Most versions of the Irenaean theodicy propose that creation is incomplete, as humans are not yet fully developed, and experiencing evil and suffering is necessary for such development.

Second-century philosopher and theologian [[Irenaeus]], after whom the theodicy is named, proposed a two-stage creation process in which humans require free will and the experience of evil to develop. Another early Christian theologian, [[Origen]], presented a response to the problem of evil which cast the world as a schoolroom or hospital for the soul; theologian Mark Scott has argued that Origen, rather than Irenaeus, ought to be considered the father of this kind of theodicy. [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] argued in the nineteenth century that God must necessarily create flawlessly, so this world must be the best possible world because it allows God's purposes to be naturally fulfilled. In 1966, philosopher [[John Hick]] discussed the similarities of the preceding theodicies, calling them all "Irenaean". He supported the view that creation is incomplete and argued that the world is best placed for the full moral development of humans, as it presents genuine moral choices. British philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]] proposed that, to make a free moral choice, humans must have experience of the consequences of their own actions and that natural evil must exist to provide such choices.

The development of [[process theology]] has challenged the Irenaean tradition by teaching that God's power is limited and that he cannot be responsible for evil. Twentieth-century philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]] supported the idea that this world is the best possible world, arguing that the good in the world (including God's infinite goodness) outweighs the evil and proposing that the ultimate good of God's sacrifice when Jesus was crucified necessitated the existence of evil. His free will defence was not a theodicy because he was trying to show the logical compatibility of evil and the existence of God, rather than the probability of God. [[D. Z. Phillips]] and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] challenged the instrumental use of suffering, suggesting that love cannot be expressed through suffering. However, Dostoyevsky also states that the beauty of love is evident, in that love can continue to grow, withstand and overcome even the most evil acts. [[Michael Tooley]] argued that the magnitude of suffering is excessive and that, in some cases, cannot lead to moral development. French theologian [[Henri Blocher]] criticised Hick's universalism, arguing that such a view negates free will, which was similarly important to the theodicy.

==Outline==
The Irenaean theodicy was first identified as a form of theodicy by [[John Hick]] in ''Evil and the God of Love'', written in 1966. Hick distinguished between the [[Augustinian theodicy]], which is based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, which casts God as responsible for evil but justified in it.&lt;ref name=Hall2003&gt;Hall 2003, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; The Irenaean theodicy is distinguished by its acceptance that God is responsible for evil, but that he is not at fault.&lt;ref&gt;Svendsen &amp; Pierce 2010, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidential problem of evil===
The Irenaean theodicy is a response to the [[evidential problem of evil]] which raises the problem that, if an [[omnipotent]] and [[omnibenevolent]] (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God exists, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil in the world would make the existence of God improbable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/#DirIndVerEviArgEvi | title=The Problem of Evil | publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=16 September 2002 |work=substantive revision on 21 August 2009 | accessdate=17 September 2011 | author=Tooley, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theodicy attempts to demonstrate that the existence of God remains probable, despite the occurrence of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Svendsen &amp; Pierce 2010, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation and development of humans===
According to the Irenaean tradition, humans are not created perfectly, but in a state of imperfection.&lt;ref name=S&amp;P2010&gt;Svendsen &amp; Pierce 2010, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; The theodicy teaches that creation has two stages: humans were first created in the image of God, and will then be created in the likeness of God. Humans are imperfect because the second stage is incomplete, entailing the potential, not yet actualised, for humans to reach perfection. To achieve this likeness of God, humans must be refined and developed.&lt;ref&gt;Engel, Soldan &amp; Durand 2004, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; The theodicy proposes that evil and suffering exists in the world because this is the best way for humans to develop. As such, the Irenaean theodicy is sometimes referred to as the "soul-making theodicy", a phrase taken from the poet [[John Keats]].&lt;ref name=S&amp;P2010 /&gt;

===Greatest possible world===
Typical to variations of the Irenaean theodicy is the notion that the present world is the greatest possible world, or the [[best of all possible worlds]].&lt;ref&gt;Eriksen 1998, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on the Irenaean idea of human development, suggesting that the best possible world would be best suited to human development: a world containing evil and suffering would allow development better than one which does not, so the world is considered the best possible world.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood &amp; Alles 2006, p. 446&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Sistine jonah.jpg|thumb|Irenaeus used the Biblical example of Jonah as someone whose suffering brought about a greater good]]

===Irenaeus===
Second-century philosopher [[Irenaeus]] developed a theodicy based on the idea that the creation of humans is still in progress.&lt;ref name="Encountering evil"&gt;Davis 2001, pp. 40–42&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that creation consists of two distinct parts: first in the [[image of God]], then in the likeness of God.  Irenaeus believed the first stage is complete, but the second stage requires humans to develop and grow into the likeness of God, a stage which Irenaeus believed is still in progress. He believed that, in order to achieve moral perfection, humans must be given free choice, with the actual possibility of choosing to do evil.&lt;ref name=ESD2007&gt;Engel, Soldan &amp; Durand 2007, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Irenaeus argued that for humans to have free will, God must be at an [[epistemology|epistemic distance]] (or intellectual distance) from humans, far enough that belief in God remains a free choice.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2001, p.41&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Irenaeus saw the purpose of the world to be the development of the moral character of humans, he believed that a good world would be best suited to that purpose. Irenaeaus believed that this world would include some suffering and evil to help people draw closer to God. He perceived God's declaration in the [[Book of Genesis]] that his creation was good to mean that the world is fit for purpose, rather than being free from suffering.&lt;ref name=ESD2007 /&gt; To illustrate the benefits of suffering, Irenaeus cited the Biblical example of [[Jonah]], from the [[Book of Jonah]]. His suffering, being swallowed by a whale, both enabled God's plan to be fulfilled and also brought Jonah closer to God: Jonah ended up repenting for his sin and the people of Nineveh turn to God.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, Ch. ''God endured Jonah's absorption, man's long punishment.'' p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

Irenaeus' [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]] was based on a literal interpretation of the Bible, especially the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;Minns 2010, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that there would be 6000 years of suffering before the world ends in a fiery purge. This fire would purify believers ahead of a new human community existing in the [[New Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Barber &amp; Neville 2005, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The afterlife, Irenaeus proposed, focuses more on time than space; he looked forward to a time in which humans are fully developed and live the life of God.&lt;ref&gt;Bretherton 2011, Ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origen===
Early Christian theologian [[Origen]] also presented suffering as necessary for the development of human beings. Theologian Mark Scott has argued that John Hick's theodicy is more closely aligned with Origen's beliefs than Irenaeus' and ought to be called an "Origenian theodicy". Origen used two metaphors for the world: it is a school and a hospital for souls, with God as Teacher and Physician, in which suffering plays both an educative and healing role. Through an [[allegory|allegorical]] reading of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] and the books of [[Solomon]], Origen casts human development as a progression though a series of stages which take place in this life and after death. Origen believed that all humans will eventually reach heaven as the logical conclusion of God being 'all in all'. Hell is a metaphor for the purification of our souls: our sinful nature goes to 'Hell' and our original nature, created by God, goes to heaven. Scott argues that significant aspects of Origen's theology mean that there is a stronger continuation between it and Hick's theodicy. These aspects are Origen's allegorical treatment of [[Adam and Eve]], the presentation of the world as a hospital or schoolroom, the progression he advocates of the human soul, and his universalism.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2010, pp. 322-333&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friedrich Schleiermacher===
In the early 19th century, Friedrich Schleiermacher wrote ''Speeches'' and ''The Christian Faith'', proposing a theodicy which John Hick later identified as Irenaean in nature. Schleiermacher began his theodicy by asserting that God is omnipotent and benevolent and concluded that, because of this, "God would create flawlessly". He proposed that it would be illogical for a perfect creation to go wrong (as Augustine had suggested) and that evil must have been created by God for a good reason.&lt;ref&gt;Engel &amp; Soldan 2008, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Schleiermacher conceived a perfect world to be one in which God's purposes can naturally be achieved, and will ultimately lead to dependence on God. He conceived sin as being an obstruction to humanity's dependence on God, arguing that it is almost inevitable, but citing Jesus as an example of a sinless man, whose consciousness of God was unobstructed.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Peters, Hewlett &amp; Russell 2008, pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; This theology led Schleiermacher to [[Christian Universalism|universalism]], arguing that it is God's will for everyone to be saved and that no person could alter this.&lt;ref name=Hall2122&gt;Hall 2003, pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quote|If we proceed on this definite assumption that all belonging to the human race are eventually taken up into loving fellowship with Christ, there is nothing for it but this single divine fore-ordination.|Friedrich Schleiermacher|The Christian Faith&lt;ref name=Hall2122 /&gt;}}

===John Hick===

[[John Wick]] published ''[[Evil and the God of Love]]'' in 1966, in which he developed a theodicy based on the work of Irenaeus. Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, based on human development.&lt;ref name="Hall2003" /&gt; Hick framed his theodicy as an attempt to respond to the problem of evil in light of scientific development, such as Darwin's [[theory of evolution]], and as an alternative to the traditionally accepted [[Augustinian theodicy]].&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting the idea that humans were created perfectly and then [[original sin|fell away from perfection]], Hick instead argued that humans are still in the process of creation.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2011, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; He interpreted the [[fall of man]], described in the [[book of Genesis]], as a mythological description of the current state of humans.&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hick/#SH3a | title=John Hick (1922– ) | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=3 November 2009 | accessdate=6 September 2011 | author=Cramer, David C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hick used Irenaeus' notion of two-stage creation and supported the belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2001, pp. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt; Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will.&lt;ref name=IEP /&gt; Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if there is an element of mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2010, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

The value Hick placed on free will was the result of his belief that it is necessary for genuine love: he believed that love which is not freely chosen is valueless. A genuinely loving God, he argued, would have created humans with free will. Hick held that it would be possible for God to create beings that would always freely choose to do good, but argued that a genuine relationship requires the possibility of rejection.&lt;ref&gt;Cheetham 2003, pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; Irenaeus' notion of humans existing at an "epistemic distance" from God also influenced Hick, as it would ensure a free choice in belief in God.&lt;ref name=IEP /&gt; Hick argued that a world without pain or suffering would prevent moral development; such a world would have no fixed structure, or have a structure subject to divine intervention, preventing humans from coming to any harm. Hick argued that this would leave humans unable to help or harm one another, allowing them no moral choices and so preventing moral development.&lt;ref&gt;Stump 1999, pp. 222–227&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of his theodicy required Hick to propose an [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]] in which humans are fully morally developed. He proposed a [[universalism|universalist]] theory, arguing that all humans would eventually reach heaven. Hick believed that there would be no benefit or purpose to an eternal Hell, as it would render any moral development inconsequential. The eternal suffering of Hell could not be explained in terms of human development, so Hick rejected it. Despite this, he did not reject the existence of Hell outright, as to do so could make living morally in this life irrelevant. Rather, he argued that Hell exists as a mythological concept and as a warning of the importance of this life.&lt;ref&gt;Hall 2003, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

===Richard Swinburne===
British philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]] proposed a version of the Irenaean theodicy based on his [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian]] view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent.&lt;ref&gt;Little 2005, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability.&lt;ref&gt;Stump 1999, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil in order to understand the consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell &amp; Wilkinson 2010, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment,&lt;ref&gt;Hall 2003, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.&lt;ref&gt;Hall 2003, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Process theology===
[[File:Dr.griffin.jpg|thumb|Process theologian David Ray Griffin contested "the utility of soul making"]]
The development of [[process theology]] has presented a challenge to the Irenaean theodicy. The doctrine proposes that God is benevolent but suggests that his power is restricted to persuasion, rather than coercion and so is unable to prevent certain evil events from occurring.&lt;ref&gt;Migliore 2004, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Process theology accepts God's indirect responsibility for evil, but maintains that he is blameless, and does everything in his power to bring about good.&lt;ref&gt;Melse 1993, pp. 13&lt;/ref&gt; In his introduction to process theology, C. Robert Melse argued that, although suffering does sometimes bring about good, not all suffering is valuable and that most does more harm than good.&lt;ref&gt;Melse 1993, pp. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Process theologian [[David Ray Griffin|David Griffin]] contested "the utility of soul making". He argued that the Irenaean theodicy supposes that God inflicts pain for his own ends, which Griffin regarded as immoral.&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton 2005, pp. 131–133&lt;/ref&gt;

===D. Z. Phillips===
[[File:Birkenau gate.JPG|thumb|D. Z. Phillips argued that the magnitude of suffering experienced in the Holocaust cannot be justified by any apparent gains]]
Philosopher [[Dewi Zephaniah Phillips]] published ''The Problem of Evil and the Problem of God'' in 2004, presenting a challenge to the Irenaean theodicy. Phillips maintained throughout his work that humans are incapable of fully understanding God, and presented an understanding of the moral diversity of human existence.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson &amp; Campbell 2010, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; With reference to the suffering of [[the Holocaust]], he rejected any theodicy which presents suffering as instrumental, arguing that such suffering cannot be justified, regardless of any good that comes of it.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson &amp; Campbell 2010, p. 183–184&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fyodor Dostoyevsky===

Russian novelist [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] presented a similar argument in his novel, ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''. This is however not a final argument, given the nature of Dostoyevsky's work as polyphonic.  In the novel, the character Ivan Karamazov presents an account of incredible cruelty to innocent people and children to his theist brother, Alyosha. Following this, Ivan asks his brother if he would, hypothetically, choose to be the architect of the eternal happiness of mankind, which would come into existence, if, and only if he would torture an innocent child, a necessary evil, after which this eternal happiness would 
come into existence.&lt;ref&gt;Aitfield 2006, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quotation
|"Would you consent to be the architect under those conditions? Tell me honestly!"
&lt;br /&gt;
"No, I wouldn't agree," said Alyosha quietly.
|Fyodor Dostoyevsky
|''The Brothers Karamazov'', p. 308&lt;ref&gt;Barnhart 2550, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;}}

But Dostoyevsky's work, polyphonic in nature, also states that the love Christ showed to all people and for all people, which is Alyosha's final stance in the novel, is the only good, and in the face of evil, the beauty that will save the world.

===Michael Tooley===
Writing in the [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], [[Michael Tooley]] rejected the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He argued that the magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the suffering endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the suffering both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to moral development. Finally, he questioned whether the current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience too great a pain to learn from it, as well as people who suffer too little to learn anything, he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/#SouMakThe | title=The Problem of Evil | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=16 September 2002 | accessdate=12 February 2012 | author=Tooley, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Henri Blocher===
French theologian [[Henri Blocher]] criticised the universalism of John Hick's theory. Blocher argued that universalism contradicts free will, which is vital to the Irenaean theodicy, because, if everyone will receive salvation, humans cannot choose to reject God. Hick did attempt to address this issue: he argued that a free action is one which reflects that character of a person, and that humans were created with a "Godward bias", so would choose salvation. Blocher proposed that Hick must then accept a level of [[determinism]], though not going all the way.&lt;ref&gt;Blocher 2005, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Fiez is known for her research in neuroscience, specifically on the [[cerebellum]] and how it is involved in processing information separately and in unison with the [[Frontal lobe|frontal lobes]], and its functions that extend beyond [[motor control]].  Fiez's research on the role of the cerebellum and its influence on non-motor behavior has focused on how the cerebellum interacts with non-motor areas of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strick|first=Peter L.|last2=Dum|first2=Richard P.|last3=Fiez|first3=Julie A.|date=2009|title=Cerebellum and Nonmotor Function|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.060407.125606|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=413–434|doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.060407.125606|issn=0147-006X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[neuroimaging]], Fiez and her colleagues found evidence for closed-loop circuits in cerebro-cerebellar interactions that indicate the role of the cerebellum not only in movement, but also in [[cognition]]. In her research, she uses behavioral, [[Neuropsychology|neuropsychological]],and neuroimaging methods to discover how the brain gives rise to the mind. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shrs.pitt.edu/people/julie-fiez|title=Julie A. Fiez {{!}} School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences {{!}} University of Pittsburgh School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences|website=www.shrs.pitt.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Fiez and her colleagues have used [[positron emission tomography]] to study distinct functions of the cerebellum and non-motor cortical areas of the frontal lobe, also known as the [[fronto-cerebellar dissociation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strick|first=Peter L.|last2=Dum|first2=Richard P.|last3=Fiez|first3=Julie A.|date=2009|title=Cerebellum and Nonmotor Function|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.060407.125606|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=413–434|doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.060407.125606|issn=0147-006X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such studies have identified differences in brain activity in the left-frontal and right-cerebellar parts of the brain when research participants are given simple verbal response tasks, such as generating associations between nouns and verbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raichle|first=Marcus E.|last2=Fiez|first2=Julie A.|last3=Videen|first3=Tom O.|last4=MacLeod|first4=Ann-Mary K.|last5=Pardo|first5=Jose V.|last6=Fox|first6=Peter T.|last7=Petersen|first7=Steven E.|date=1994|title=Practice-related Changes in Human Brain Functional Anatomy during Nonmotor Learning|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/4.1.8|journal=Cerebral Cortex|language=en|volume=4|issue=1|pages=8–26|doi=10.1093/cercor/4.1.8|issn=1047-3211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research team also used positron emission [[tomography]] to study [[short-term memory]] and discovered the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] to be active in short-term maintenance of verbal and nonverbal information while the left frontal opercular regions were only linked to [[Verbal memory|verbal memory.]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fiez|first=JA|last2=Raife|first2=EA|last3=Balota|first3=DA|last4=Schwarz|first4=JP|last5=Raichle|first5=ME|last6=Petersen|first6=SE|date=1996-01-15|title=A positron emission tomography study of the short-term maintenance of verbal information|url=https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/8551361|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=808–822|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.16-02-00808.1996|issn=0270-6474}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fiez and Petersen used neuroimaging to identify the involvement of multiple brain areas in word reading, including left-lateralized regions in occipital and occipitotemporal cortex, the left frontal operculum, bilateral regions in the cerebellum, [[primary motor cortex]], and the superior and middle [[Temporal lobe|temporal cortex]], and medial regions in the supplementary motor area and [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fiez|first=Julie A.|last2=Petersen|first2=Steven E.|date=1998|title=Neuroimaging studies of word reading|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/95/3/914|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=95|issue=3|pages=914–921|doi=10.1073/pnas.95.3.914|issn=0027-8424|pmid=9448259|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other research, Fiez and her colleagues used mixed methods, including [[Electrical brain stimulation|electrical brain simulation]], to elaborate on the long debated [[Visual word form area#Pre-lexical Visual Word Form Hypothesis|visual word form hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hirshorn|first=Elizabeth A.|last2=Li|first2=Yuanning|last3=Ward|first3=Michael J.|last4=Richardson|first4=R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3217">'''Land for Wildlife''' is a program sponsored by the [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|Department of Sustainability and Environment]] in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]].  It was established in November 1981 to support private landholders and managers who voluntarily provide and enhance habitat for native wildlife on their properties within the state.  Many non-landholder volunteers also participate in the scheme, which is coordinated by departmental extension officers.  By doing so they are contributing to the maintenance and restoration of native [[biodiversity]].  The scheme was largely instigated by [[Ellen McCulloch]] and [[Reg Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;Anon (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; two prominent members of the community group [[Bird Observation &amp; Conservation Australia]] (then the Bird Observers Club - now merged with [[BirdLife Australia]]), with which it continues to have a cooperative relationship.&lt;ref name=lfw&gt;Land for Wildlife.&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefits of full registration of a property in the scheme include on-site visits to provide advice and answer questions about how to manage the land to contribute to biodiversity conservation, participation in field and neighbourhood days, open-properties and information sessions, a regular newsletter, specialist information and a Land for Wildlife sign.  It does not alter the legal status of a property in any way and landholders may withdraw from the scheme at any time.&lt;ref name=lfw/&gt;

As of 2012 there were over 5,700 participating properties, with about 15,000 people involved in the program.  The area of wildlife habitat being managed on the properties totals more than 560,000 hectares (4% of private land in Victoria), and includes [[grassland]]s, [[heath]]s, [[woodland]]s, [[forest]]s and [[freshwater]] [[wetland]]s.&lt;ref name=lfw/&gt;

The Victorian Land For Wildlife program allows interstate agencies (government and non-government) to deliver the scheme under an agreement in which the original aims and objectives are maintained.

These are biblical figures unambiguously identified in contemporary sources according to [[Scientific consensus|scholarly consensus]]. Biblical figures that are identified in artifacts of questionable authenticity, for example the [[Jehoash Inscription]] and the bullae of [[Baruch ben Neriah]], or who are mentioned in ancient but non-contemporary documents, such as [[David]] and [[Balaam]],&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Identified in the [[Tel Dan Stele]] and the [[Deir Alla Inscription]] respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; are excluded from this list.

==Hebrew Bible (Protocanonical Old Testament)==
[[File:Tilglath pileser iii.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Tiglath-Pileser III: [[stela]] from the walls of his palace ([[British Museum]], [[London]]).]]

The [[Hebrew Bible]], known in [[Judaism]] by the acronym ''Tanakh'', is the collection of ancient writings that are considered [[Sacred texts|sacred]] by both Jews and [[Christianity|Christians]]. They tell the story of the [[Jewish people]] and their ancestors, starting from the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation narrative]] and concluding near the end of the 5th century BCE.

Although the first mention of the name ''[[Land of Israel|Israel]]'' in [[Biblical archaeology|archaeology]] dates to the 13th century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Philip R., ''In Search of Ancient Israel: A Study in Biblical Origins'', Bloomsbury T&amp;T Clark, 2015, p. 48 [https://books.google.com/books?id=HJIzCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48]&lt;/ref&gt; contemporary information on the Israelite nation prior to the 9th century BCE is extremely sparse.&lt;ref name="Kelle"&gt;Kelle, Brad E., ''Ancient Israel at War 853–586 BC'', Osprey Publishing, 2007, pp. 8–9 [https://books.google.com/books?id=j5hX7ADoWNkC&amp;pg=PA8]&lt;/ref&gt; In the following centuries a small number of local Hebrew documents, mostly seals and [[Bulla (seal)|bullae]], mention biblical characters, but more extensive information is available in the royal inscriptions from neighbouring kingdoms, particularly [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylon]], [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyria]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Kelle"/&gt;

== Deuterocanonicals or biblical apocrypha ==
[[File:AlexanderIBalasAndCleopatraThea.jpg|thumb|[[Cleopatra Thea]] with her first husband, [[Alexander Balas]]]]
The [[deuterocanon]] consists of books and parts of books that are included in the Old Testament canon of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and/or [[Roman Catholic]] churches, but are not part of the Jewish [[Tanakh]], and are regarded as [[apocrypha]]l by [[Protestant]]s. In contrast to the Tanakh, which is preserved in Hebrew (with some Aramaic parts), the deuterocanonical books are preserved mainly in [[Koine Greek]], though Hebrew and Aramaic fragments have been found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].

While the deuterocanon describes events between the eighth and second centuries BCE, most historically identifiable people mentioned in the deuterocanon lived around the time of the [[Maccabean Revolt]] (167 – 160 BCE), by which time [[Judea]] had become part of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Coins featuring the names of rulers had become widespread and many of them were inscribed with the year number in the [[Seleucid era]], allowing them to be dated precisely. First-hand information comes also from the Greek historian [[Polybius]] (c. 200 – c. 118 BCE), whose ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'' covers much of the same period as the [[Books of Maccabees]], and from Greek and Babylonian inscriptions.

==New Testament==

[[File:Cameo August BM Gem3577.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Blacas Cameo]] (20–50 CE) depicting Roman emperor [[Augustus]]]]
By far the most important and most detailed sources for first-century Jewish history are the works of Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] (37 – c. 100 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Grabbe, Lester L., ''An Introduction to First Century Judaism: Jewish Religion and History in the Second Temple Period'', A&amp;C Black, 1996, p. 22 [https://books.google.com/books?id=DO6kT5RPuxgC&amp;pg=PA22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Millar, Fergus, ''The Roman Near East, 31 BC–AD 337'', Harvard University Press, 1993, p. 70 [https://books.google.com/books?id=IA-YlZqHv90C&amp;pg=PA70]&lt;/ref&gt; These books mention many of the same prominent political figures as the New Testament books and are crucial for understanding the historical background of the emergence of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Louis H., ''Josephus, the Bible, and History'', Brill, 1989, p. 18 [https://books.google.com/books?id=lV70mR-E0DQC&amp;pg=PA18]&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus also mentions [[Jesus]] and the execution of [[John the Baptist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFAntiq|Antiquities]], [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 5|Book XVIII Chr. 5 § 2]]&lt;/ref&gt; although he was not a contemporary of either. Apart from Josephus, information about some New Testament figures comes from Roman historians such as [[Tacitus]] and [[Suetonius]] and from ancient coins and inscriptions.

The central figure of the New Testament is [[Jesus of Nazareth]]. Despite ongoing debate concerning the authorship of many of its books, there is a consensus&lt;ref name="ErdComm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFCoogan|Coogan et al., 2010]], p. 1973 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nc-i_pQsiW8C&amp;pg=RA2-PA240]&lt;/ref&gt; among modern scholars that at least some were written by a contemporary of Jesus,&lt;ref&gt;Murphy-O'Connor, Jerome, ''Paul: a critical life'', Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 4 [https://books.google.com/books?id=yTddaMGsuWMC&amp;pg=PA4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cate, Robert L., ''One untimely born: the life and ministry of the Apostle Paul'' Mercer University Press, 2006, p. 48 [https://books.google.com/books?id=vMVwtMopjeUC&amp;pg=PA48]&lt;/ref&gt; namely the epistles of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], parts of which are considered [[Authorship of the Pauline epistles#Undisputed epistles|undisputed]]. However, outside the New Testament, no contemporary references to Jesus are known, unless a very early dating is assumed of some uncanonical gospel such as the [[Gospel of Thomas]]. Nevertheless, some authentic first century and many second century writings exist in which Jesus is mentioned,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;These sources include (but are not limited to) ''1st century'': [[Pauline Epistles|Paul]], [[First Epistle of Peter|Peter]], [[Josephus on Jesus|Josephus]], [[First Epistle of Clement|Clement]] and the [[Synoptic Gospels]]; ''2nd century'': [[Tacitus on Christ|Tacitus]], [[Lucian on Jesus|Lucian]], [[Ignatius of Antioch]], [[Polycarp's letter to the Philippians|Polycarp]], [[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]], [[Justin Martyr]] and a number of [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal works]]. For dates of the New Testament books, see [[Dating the Bible#Table IV: New Testament]].&lt;/ref&gt; leading scholars to conclude that the [[historicity of Jesus]] is well established by historical documents.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Amy-Jill ed., Allison, Dale C. Jr. ed., Crossan, John Dominic ed.,  ''The Historical Jesus in Context'', Princeton University Press, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HIp_0N3uPPcC&amp;pg=PA4] "''Most scholars agree that Jesus was baptized by John, (...) engaged in healings and exorcisms, taught in parables, (...) and was crucified by Roman soldiers during the governorship of Pontius Pilate (26–36 CE)''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham Stanton|Stanton, Graham]], ''The Gospels and Jesus'' Oxford University Press, 2nd ed. 2002, p. 145. He writes: "''Today nearly all historians, whether Christians or not, accept that Jesus existed and that the gospels contain plenty of valuable evidence which has to be weighed and assessed critically.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bockmuehl, Markus N. A., ''The Cambridge companion to Jesus'', Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 124 [https://books.google.com/books?id=vSehrtQpcYcC&amp;pg=PA124] "''The fact that Jesus existed, that he was crucified under Pontius Pilate (...) seems to be part of the bedrock of historical tradition. If nothing else, the non-Christian evidence can provide us with certainty on that score''"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tentatively identified==

These are Biblical figures for which tentative but likely identifications have been found in contemporary sources based on matching names and credentials. The possibility of coincidental matching of names cannot be ruled out however.

===Hebrew Bible (Protocanonical Old Testament)===

* [[Ahaziah of Judah|Ahaziah]]/[[Amaziah of Judah|Amaziah]], King of Judah. The [[Tel Dan Stele]] contains, according to many scholars, an account by a Syrian king (probably Hazael), claiming to have slain "[Ahaz]iahu, son of [... kin]g of the house of David", who reigned c. 850 – 849 BCE.&lt;ref name="DeverBeyond"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dever|first=William G.|title=Beyond the Texts: An Archaeological Portrait of Ancient Israel and Judah|page=492|date=2017|publisher=SBL Press|isbn=9780884142171|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mog6DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Irvine"&gt;{{cite book |last=Irvine |first=Stuart A. |editor1-last=Dearman |editor1-first=J.

* [[Asaiah]], servant of king [[Josiah]] (2 Kings 22:12). A seal with the text ''Asayahu servant of the king'' probably belonged to him.&lt;ref&gt;Heltzer, Michael, ''THE SEAL OF ˓AŚAYĀHŪ''. In [[#CITEREFHallo|Hallo, 2000]], Vol. II p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;
* Azaliah son of Meshullam, scribe in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]: Mentioned in [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 22:3 and [[Book of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 34:8. A bulla reading "belonging to Azaliabu son of Meshullam." is likely to be his, according to archaeologist [[Nahman Avigad]].&lt;ref&gt;Avigad, Nahman, ''Corpus of West Semitic Stamp Seals'', (p. 237 WSS 90), published by the  Israel Academy of Sciences &amp; Humanities&lt;/ref&gt;
* Azariah son of [[Hilkiah]] and grandfather of [[Ezra]]: Mentioned in [[Book of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] 6:13,14; 9:11 and [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 7:1. A bulla reading ''Azariah son of Hilkiah'' is likely to be his, according to Tsvi Schneider.&lt;ref name="Six"&gt;Schneider, Tsvi, ''Six Biblical Signatures: Seals and seal impressions of six biblical personages recovered''', ''Biblical Archaeology Review'', July/August 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Baalis]] king of Ammon is mentioned in Jeremiah 40:14. In 1984 an Ammonite seal, dated to c. 600 BCE, was excavated in Tell El-`Umeiri, [[Jordan]] that reads "''belonging to Milkomor, the servant of Baalisha''".

* [[Jehoram of Israel|Jehoram]], King of Israel (c. 852 – 841 BCE) is probably mentioned in the Tel Dan inscription. According to the usual interpretation, the author of the text, probably Hazael, king of Syria,&lt;ref&gt;http://theosophical.wordpress.com/2011/07/15/biblical-archaeology-4-the-moabite-stone-a-k-a-mesha-stele/&lt;/ref&gt; claims to have slain both [[Ahaziah of Judah]] and "[Jeho]ram".&lt;ref name="DeverBeyond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Irvine"/&gt; However, some scholars, reconstructing the pieces of the stela differently, do not see "[..]ram" as the name of an Israelite king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Athas|first=George|title=The Tel Dan Inscription: A Reappraisal and a New Introduction|pages=240–242|date=2006|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9780567040435|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OPqpzmYBOxgC&amp;pg=PA242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Robert Deutsch the bulla is from the late 8th to early 7th century BCE, before the time of Jeremiah.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

* Jeroboam (II), king of Israel. A seal belonging to 'Shema, servant of Jeroboam', probably refers to king [[Jeroboam II]],&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, John, ''The Cambridge ancient history, Vol. 3 Part 1'', p. 501 [https://books.google.com/books?id=vXljf8JqmkoC&amp;pg=PA501]&lt;/ref&gt; although some scholars think it was [[Jeroboam|Jeroboam I]].&lt;ref name="Mykyt"/&gt;
* [[Jezebel (biblical)|Jezebel]], wife of king Ahab of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]]. A seal was found that may bear her name, but the dating and identification with the biblical Jezebel is a subject of debate among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Korpel, Marjo C.A., ''[http://www.bib-arch.org/debates/jezebel-seal-01.asp Scholars Debate “Jezebel” Seal]'', Biblical Archaeology Review&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Seraiah]] son of Neriah. He was the brother of [[Baruch ben Neriah|Baruch]]. Nahman Avigad identified him as the owner of a seal with the name " to Seriahu/Neriyahu".&lt;ref name="Six" /&gt;
[[Image:Silwan-inscr.jpg|right|400px|thumb|The so-called Shebna Lintel]]
* [[Shebna]] (or Shebaniah), royal steward of [[Hezekiah]]: only the last two letters of a name (''hw'') survive on the so-called Shebna lintel, but the title of his position ("over the house"  of the king) and the date indicated by the script style, have inclined many scholars to identify the person it refers to with Shebna.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, Robert, ''[http://www.bib-arch.org/bar/article.asp?PubID=BSBA&amp;Volume=35&amp;Issue=3&amp;ArticleID=9 Tracking Down Shebnayahu, Servant of the King]'' in ''Biblical Archaeology Review'' May/Jun 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sheshonq I]], Pharaoh of Egypt, is normally identified with king [[Shishaq]] in the Hebrew Bible. The account of Shishaq's invasion in the 5th year of [[Rehoboam]] (1 Kings 14:25–28) is thought to correspond to an inscription found at Karnak of Shoshenq's campaign into Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Grabbe, Lester L., ''Israel in transition: from late Bronze II to Iron IIa (c. 1250–850 B.C.E.)'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2010, p. 84 [https://books.google.com/books?id=agSC0aHvri0C&amp;pg=PA84]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a minority of scholars reject this identification.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, N., ''The Cypro-Phoenician pottery of the Iron Age'', Brill, 2003 p. 87 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0ITEc8yuYu4C&amp;pg=PA87]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tou (biblical figure)|Tou/Toi]], king of Hamath.

One Quintus Sergius Paulus, who was proconsul of Cyprus probably during the reign of Claudius (41–54 CE) is however compatible with the time and context of Luke's account.&lt;ref name="BoA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bromiley, Geoffrey W. (ed.), ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia Vol. III: K–P [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zkla5Gl_66oC]'' Wm. B. Eerdmans 1986, pp. 729–730 (entry ''Paulus, Sergius'')&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lysanias]], was tetrarch of [[Abila Lysaniou|Abila]] around 28 CE, according to Luke (3:1). Because Josephus only mentions a Lysanias of Abila who was executed in 36 BCE, some scholars have considered this an error by Luke. However, one inscription from Abila, which is tentatively dated 14–29 CE, appears to record the existence of a later tetrarch called Lysanias.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, C. M., ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'', Wm. B. Eerdmans 1939, entry ''Lysanias  [http://www.internationalstandardbible.com/L/lysanias.html]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Leon, ''Luke: an introduction and commentary [https://books.google.com/books?id=1ngd8XtswdEC]'' Wm. B. Eerdmans 1988, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Theudas]].  The sole reference to Theudas presents a problem of chronology. In [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[Gamaliel]], a member of the [[sanhedrin]], defends the apostles by referring to Theudas (Acts 5:36–8). The difficulty is that the rising of Theudas is here given as before that of [[Judas of Galilee]], which is itself dated to the [[Census of Quirinius|time of the taxation]] (''c.'' 6–7 AD).  [[Josephus]], on the other hand, says that Theudas was 45 or 46, which is after Gamaliel is speaking, and long after Judas the Galilean.

'''Low-definition television''' ('''LDTV''') refers to [[television system]]s that have a lower [[screen resolution]] than [[standard-definition television]] systems. The term is usually used in reference to [[digital television]], in particular when [[broadcasting]] at the same (or similar) resolution as low-definition [[analog TV]] systems. [[Mobile television|Mobile DTV]] systems usually transmit in low definition, as do all [[slow-scan TV]] systems.

==Sources==
The most common source of LDTV programming is the [[Internet]], where mass distribution of higher-resolution [[video file]]s could overwhelm [[computer server]]s and take too long to [[download]]. Many [[mobile phone]]s and portable devices such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]’s [[iPod Nano]], or Sony’s [[PlayStation Portable]] use LDTV video, as higher-resolution files would be excessive to the needs of their small screens ([[QVGA|320×240]] and 480×272 [[pixel]]s respectively). The current generation of iPod Nanos have LDTV screens, as do the first three generations of [[iPod Touch]] and [[iPhone]] (480×320).

For the first years of its existence, [[YouTube]] offered only one, low-definition resolution of 320x240p at 30fps or less, only extending - first to widescreen 426×240, then to gradually higher resolutions - once the video service had become well established, it could afford radically improved storage space and transmission bandwidth, and could rely on a good proportion of its users having high-speed internet connections. More recently, YouTube has also extended further into the LDTV realm by adding an even lower 256×144p resolution with a halved framerate - giving an overall effect reminiscent of early online video streaming attempts using [[RealVideo]] or similar, where 160×120p at single-figure &lt;abbr title="frames per second"&gt;fps&lt;/abbr&gt; was deemed acceptable - to cater to those whose network connections could not even widthstand the rigors of "240p".

A [[VHS]] [[videotape]] can be considered SDTV due to its resolution (approximately 360 × 480i/576i), but using VHS for professional production will yield results subjectively comparable to LDTV because of VHS's low [[VHS#Video recording|bandwidth]], particularly in the field of color reproduction, which can be as little as a few hundred kHz, translating to a few dozen color clocks per line. VHS does, however, still provide [[high motion]] and a relatively high vertical resolution via interlacing, which is a feature uncommon in true LDTV material, and reasonable luma resolution.

In comparison, professional-level [[Betacam SP]] tape produces approx 440×486i/576i, and some [[college]] [[TV studio]]s use [[Super VHS]] at ~560×486i/576i, along with an increased colour carrier bandwidth. Both of these systems, whilst showing a marked improvement over VHS, ultimately offer lower resolution images than DVD, but are still comparable to (and thus remain useful for) lower-bandwidth broadcast television, which is compromised in the analogue domain by a narrower available frequency range for each individual channel, and in the digital by a literally lower horizontal pixel count (often 480 or 544, versus the 720 of DVD and full-rate SDTV broadcasts). Again, both systems offer high motion and a high vertical resolution by way of interlacing, and are more justifiably counted as SD rather than LD.

&lt;!-- Before you edit this paragraph, consider reading the linked citations carefully. Otherwise, retro gaming enthusiasts armed with oscilloscopes, old video game consoles, analog CRT televisions, and heavily-marked-up printouts of BT.470-5 may come knocking at your metaphorical door. --&gt;Older [[video game console]]s and home computers often generated a technically-compliant NTSC or PAL signal, but only sent one field type rather than alternating between the two.  This created a 240- or 288-line progressive signal, which in theory can be decoded on any receiver that can decode normal, interlaced signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scanlines.hazard-city.de/ |title=Scanlines Demystified |accessdate=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://retrogaming.hazard-city.de/ |title=Connecting your old videogames to your new flatpanel TV set |accessdate=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="snesinterlaced" /&gt;  Since the [[shadow mask]] and beam width of standard [[cathode ray tube]] televisions were designed for interlaced signals, these systems produced a distinctive fixed pattern of alternating bright and dark [[scan lines]]; many [[emulators]] for older systems offer to recreate this effect.  The horizontal resolution ranged from 160 pixels to 720 pixels, depending on the video chip's capabilities (and the skill of the programmer).   

The [[Video CD]] format was introduced on such a console ([[CD-i]]), and it likewise originally used a [[progressive scan|progressive]] LDTV signal {{citation needed|date=March 2015}} (352×240 or 352×288), which is half the vertical and horizontal resolution of full-bandwidth [[SDTV]]. However, most DVD and SVCD players, as well as VCD 2.0 players (which can display still images at 704×480/576i and offer limited DVD menu-esque functions), will internally upscale VCD material to 704x480/576i (or 480/576p for progressive-scan players) for playback, as this is both more widely compatible and gives a better overall appearance. No motion information is lost due to this process, as, unlike the single-field output of classic computers and consoles, VCD video is not high-motion and only plays back at 25 or 30 frames per second. A similar recording standard (quarter-resolution and half framerate) is also used for super-long-play home DVD recording, although it does not typically adhere to the same bitrate or encoding specifications, and could therefore be considered LDTV. (Regular "LP" DVD recording is closest in spec to a high grade VHS or Betamax recording, having half the normal horizontal resolution and a lower bitrate, but otherwise being identical to a full-rate "SP" recording, including high-motion interlace, and thus still qualifies as SDTV)

With the late 1980s introduction of 16 and 32-bit computers/game consoles, such as [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore Amiga]], [[Super Nintendo]]&lt;ref name="snesinterlaced" /&gt;, and [[Sega Genesis]], outputs up to 486i/576i were supported for the first time, but rarely used due to heavy demands on processing power and memory.  Standard resolutions also had a tendency to produce annoying flicker at horizontal edges unless employed quite carefully, such as using anti-aliasing, which was either not available or computationally exorbitant.  Thus, 240/288p remained the primary format on most games of the fourth and [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth generation consoles]] (Sega Saturn, PlayStation and Nintendo 64).  With the advent of [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|sixth generation consoles]] and the launch of the [[Dreamcast]], 480/576i use became more common, and 240/288p usage declined.

More recent game systems tend to use only properly interlaced NTSC or PAL in addition to higher resolution modes, except when running games designed for older, compatible systems in their native modes. The [[PlayStation 2]] generates 240p/288p if a PlayStation game calls for this mode, as do many [[Virtual Console]] emulated games on [[Wii]]. Nintendo's official [[software development kit]] documentation refers to 240p as 'non-interlaced mode' or 'double-strike'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naesten.dyndns.org:8080/psyq/man/os/osVi.html |title=N64 Functions Reference Manual - Video Interface (VI) Management |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.djek.nl/Downloads/GC/DOCS/GRAPPRO/VI.us.pdf |title=GameCube SDK - Video Interface Library (VI) |accessdate=2011-06-27 |page=6 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the launch of the Wii Virtual Console service many users with [[component video]] cables experienced problems displaying some Virtual Console games due to certain TV models/manufacturers not supporting 240p over a component video connection. Nintendo's solution was to implement 'Wii Component Cable Interlace Mode' which forces the emulator to output 480i instead of 240p,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/ts/pictureSound.jsp#neogeo |title=Nintendo Support - Display problems while playing Virtual Console games |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; however many games released prior have still not been updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forums.computerandvideogames.com/viewtopic.php?t=32854 |title=Wii Component cable Interlace Mode |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teleconferencing LDTV==
Upcoming sources of LDTV using standard broadcasting techniques include mobile TV services powered by [[DVB-H]], [[1seg]], [[Digital Multimedia Broadcasting|DMB]], or [[ATSC-M/H]]. However, this kind of LDTV transmission technology is based on existent LDTV [[teleconferencing]] standards that have been in place for a decade or more.

{{War}}
'''Military history''' is a [[humanities]] [[List of academic disciplines|discipline]] within the scope of [[History|general historical]] recording of [[War|armed conflict]] in the [[Human history|history of humanity]], and its impact on the societies, their cultures, economies and changing [[Politics|local]] and [[international relations]]hips.

Professional historians normally focus on military affairs that had a major impact on the societies involved as well as the aftermath of conflicts, while amateur historians and hobbyists often take a larger interest in the details of battles, equipment and uniforms in use.

The essential subjects of military history study are the causes of war, the social and cultural foundations, [[Doctrine#Military usage|military doctrine on each side]], the logistics, leadership, technology, [[strategy]], and [[military tactics|tactics]] used, and how these changed over time. On the other hand, [[Just war theory|Just War Theory]] explores the moral dimensions of warfare, and to better limit the destructive reality caused by war, seeks to establish a doctrine of military ethics.

As an applied field, military history has been studied at academies and service schools because the [[Command and control (military)|military command]] seeks to not repeat past mistakes, and improve upon its current performance by instilling an ability in commanders to perceive historical parallels during a battle, so as to capitalize on the lessons learned from the past.  When certifying military history instructors&lt;ref&gt;http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/cace/csi/mhic&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Combat Studies Institute]] deemphasizes rote detail memorization and focuses on themes and context in relation to current and future conflict, using the motto "Past is Prologue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegriffon108.com/articles/article-detail/articleid/3987/becoming-a-military-history-instructor-in-the-army.aspx|title=Becoming a Military History Instructor in the Army|work=The Griffon 108th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline of military history is dynamic, changing with development as much of the subject area as the societies and organisations that make use of it.&lt;ref&gt;Cowley, Parker, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt; The dynamic nature of the discipline of military history is largely related to the rapidity of change the military forces, and the art and science of managing them, as well as the frenetic pace of [[Technological evolution|technological development]] that had taken place during the period known as the [[Industrial Revolution]], and more recently in the [[Nuclear proliferation|nuclear]] and [[information age]]s.  An important recent concept is the [[Revolution in Military Affairs]] (RMA) which attempts to explain how warfare has been shaped by emerging technologies, such as gunpowder. It highlights the short outbursts of rapid change followed by periods of relative stability.

==Popular versus academic military history==
In terms of the history profession in major countries, military history is an orphan, despite its enormous popularity with the general public. [[William H. McNeill (historian)|William H. McNeill]] points out:
:This branch of our discipline flourishes in an intellectual ghetto. The 144 books in question [published in 1968-78] fall into two distinct classes: works aimed at a popular readership, written by journalists and men of letters outside academic circles, and professional work nearly always produced within the military establishment.... The study of military history in universities remains seriously underdeveloped. Indeed, lack of interest in and disdain for military history probably constitute one of the strangest prejudices of the profession.&lt;ref&gt;William H McNeill,  "Modern European History" in Michael Kammen, ed., ''The Past Before Us: Contemporary Historical Writing in the United States'' (1980) pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John A. Lynn, "The embattled future of academic military history." ''Journal of Military History'' 61.4 (1997): 777–89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian F W Beckett|title=A Guide to British Military History: The Subject and the Sources|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DILbCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24|year=2016|publisher=Pen and Sword|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography of military history==
[[Historiography]] is the study of the history and method of the discipline of history or the study of a specialised topic. In this case, military history with an eye to gaining an accurate assessment of conflicts using all available sources. For this reason military history is periodised, creating overlaying boundaries of study and analysis in which descriptions of battles by leaders may be unreliable due to the inclination to minimize mention of failure and exaggerate success. Military historians use Historiographical analysis in an effort to allow an unbiased, contemporary view of records.&lt;ref&gt;Morillo, Pevkovic, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

One military historian, Jeremy Black, outlined problems 21st-century military historians face as an inheritance of their predecessors: Eurocentricity, a technological bias, a focus on leading military powers and dominant military systems, the separation of land from sea and recently air conflicts, the focus on state-to-state conflict, a lack of focus on political "tasking" in how forces are used.&lt;ref name="p.ix, Black"&gt;Black (2004), p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;

If these challenges were not sufficient for the military historians, the limits of method are complicated by the lack of records, either destroyed or never recorded for its value as a [[military secret]] that may prevent some salient facts from being reported at all; scholars still do not know the exact nature of [[Greek fire]] for instance. Researching Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, for example, have presented unique challenges to historians due to records that were destroyed to protect classified military information, among other reasons. Historians utilize their knowledge of government regulation and military organization, and employing a targeted and systematic research strategy to piece together war histories.&lt;ref&gt;Bergen, Hilary, ''Documenting Shock and Awe: Researching Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom' History Associations, 2015. http://www.historyassociates.com/blog/historical-research-blog/researching-iraq-and-afghanistan-wars/&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these limits, wars are some of the most studied and detailed periods of human history.

Military historians have often [[Comparative history|compared]] organization, tactical and strategic ideas, leadership, and national support of the militaries of different nations.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000'' (Random House, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, historian Jeffrey Kimball studied the influence of a historian's political position on current events on interpretive disagreement regarding the causes of 20th century wars.  He surveyed the ideological preferences of 109 active diplomatic historians in the United States as well as 54 active military historians. He finds that their current political views are moderately correlated with their historiographical interpretations. A clear position on the left-right continuum regarding capitalism was apparent in most cases.  All groups agreed with the proposition, "historically, Americans have tended to view questions of their national security  in terms of such extremes as good vs. evil."  Though the Socialists were split, the other groups agreed that "miscalculation and/or misunderstanding of the situation" had caused U.S. interventionism."  Kimball reports that:
:Of historians in the field of diplomatic history, 7% are Socialist, 19% are Other, 53% are Liberal, 11% are None and 10% Conservative. Of military historians, 0% are Socialist, 8% are Other, 35% are Liberal, 18% are None and 40% are  Conservative.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Kimball, "The Influence of Ideology on Interpretive Disagreement: A Report on a Survey of Diplomatic, Military and Peace Historians on the Causes of 20th Century U. S. Wars," ''The History Teacher''  (May, 1984) 17#3 pp. 355–84 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/493146.pdf in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early historians==
The documentation of military history begins with the confrontation between Sumer (current [[Iraq]]) and Elam (current [[Iran]]) c. 2700 BC near the modern [[Basra]]. Other prominent records in military history are the [[Trojan War]] in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' (though its [[historicity of the Iliad|historicity]] has been challenged), ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' by [[Herodotus]] (484 BC – 425 BC) who is often called the "father of history".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/tasmania/stories/s999564.htm "Herodotus: The father of history"], Warburton&lt;/ref&gt; Next was [[Thucydides]] whose impartiality, despite being an [[Athens|Athenian]], allowed him to take advantage of his exile to research the war from different perspectives by carefully examining documents and interviewing eyewitnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Farah, Karls, pp. 137–38&lt;/ref&gt; An approach centered on the analysis of a leader was taken by [[Xenophon]] (430 BC – 355 BC) in ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'', recording the expedition of [[Cyrus the Younger]] into [[Anatolia]].

The records of the Roman [[Julius Caesar]] (100 BC – 44 BC) enable a comparative approach for [[Military campaign|campaigns]] such as ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' and ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili]]''.

==Technological evolution==

[[File:Ramses II at Kadesh.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Relief of [[Ramses II]] located in [[Abu Simbel]] fighting at the [[Battle of Kadesh]] on a [[chariot]].]]

New weapons development can dramatically alter the face of war, the cost of warfare, the preparations, and the training of soldiers and leaders. A rule of thumb is that if your enemy has a potentially war winning weapon, you have to either match it or neutralize it.&lt;ref&gt;Barton C. Hacker, "Military institutions, weapons, and social change: Toward a new history of military technology." ''[[Technology and Culture]]'' 35.4 (1994): 768–834.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient era===
[[Chariot]]s originated around 2000 BC. The chariot was an effective, fast weapon; while one man controlled the maneuvering of the chariot, a second bowman could shoot arrows at enemy soldiers. These became crucial to the maintenance of several governments, including the [[New Egyptian Kingdom]] and the [[Shang Dynasty]] and the nation states of early to mid [[Zhou dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Aiken Littauer, "The military use of the chariot in the Aegean in the Late Bronze Age." ''[[American Journal of Archaeology]]'' 76.2 (1972): 145–57. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/503858 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.R.S. Moorey, "The emergence of the light, horse‐drawn chariot in the Near‐East c. 2000–1500 BC." ''[[World Archaeology]]'' 18.2 (1986): 196–215.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the military unit types and technologies which were developed in the ancient world are:&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ernest Dupuy, and Trevor Nevitt Dupuy, ''The encyclopedia of military history: from 3500 BC to the present'' (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sling (weapon)|Slinger]]
* [[Hoplite]]
* [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|Auxiliaries]]
* [[Infantry]]
* [[Archery]]
* [[Crossbowmen]]
* [[Chariots]]
* [[Cavalry]]

For settled agrarian civilizations, the infantry became the core of military action. The infantry started as opposing armed groups of soldiers underneath commanders. The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and early Romans used rigid, heavily armed [[phalanx formation|phalanxes]]. The Macedonians and Hellenistic states would adopt phalanx formations with [[sarissa]] pikemen. The [[Roman Army|Romans]] would later adopt more flexible [[maniple (military unit)|maniples]] from their neighbors which made them extremely successful in the field of battle. The kingdoms of the [[Warring States]] in East Asia also adopted infantry combat, a transition from chariot warfare from centuries earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Robin D.S. Yates, "New Light on Ancient Chinese Military Texts: Notes on Their Nature and Evolution, and the Development of Military Specialization in Warring States China." ''[[T'oung Pao]]'' (1988): 211–48. {{jstor|4528419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cavalry]] became an important tool. In the [[Sicilian Expedition]], led by Athens in an attempt to subdue [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], the well-trained Syracusan cavalry became crucial to the success of the Syracusans. [[Macedon]]ian [[Alexander the Great]] effectively deployed his cavalry forces to secure victories. In battles such as the [[Battle of Cannae]] of the [[Second Punic War]], and the [[Battle of Carrhae]] of the [[Roman-Persian Wars]], the importance of the cavalry would be repeated.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie J. Worley, ''Hippeis: the cavalry of Ancient Greece'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also [[horse archer]]s, who had the ability to shoot on horseback&amp;nbsp;– the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], [[Scythians]], [[Mongols]], and other various steppe people were especially fearsome with this tactic. By the 3rd–4th century AD, heavily armored cavalry became widely adopted by the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], [[Sassanids]], [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] and [[Three Kingdoms]], etc.

&lt;!--Even in the [[First World War]], cavalry was still considered important; the British mobilized 165,000 horses, the Austrians 600,000, the Germans 715,000, and the Russians more than a million.&lt;ref name=Keegan&gt;Keegan, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;
The early [[Indo-Iranians]] developed the use of [[chariot]]s in warfare. The [[scythed chariot]] was later invented in India and soon adopted by the [[Persian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Rop,  "Reconsidering the Origin of the Scythed Chariot." ''[[Historia (Antiquity journal)|Historia]]'' 62.2 (2013): 167–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[War elephant]]s were sometimes deployed for fighting in ancient warfare. They were first used in India and later adopted by both the Persians and [[Alexander the Great]] against one another. War elephants were also used in the [[Battle of the Hydaspes River]], and by [[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal]] in the [[Second Punic War]] against the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Frederick Gowers|William Gowers]], "The African elephant in warfare." ''[[African Affairs]]'' 46.182 (1947): 42–49. {{doi|10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a093538}}, {{jstor|718841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trireme.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A Greek [[trireme]]]]
[[Naval warfare]] was often crucial to military success. Early navies used sailing ships without cannons; often the goal was to ram the enemy ships and cause them to sink. There was human oar power, often using slaves, built up to ramming speed. [[Galley]]s were used in the [[3000 BC|3rd millennium BC]] by the [[Crete|Cretans]]. The Greeks later advanced these ships.&lt;ref&gt;John S. Morrison, "The Greek Trireme." ''[[The Mariner's Mirror]]'' 27.1 (1941): 14–44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
H. T. Wallinga, "The Trireme and History" ''[[Mnemosyne (journal)|Mnemosyne]]''  Vol. 43, Fasc. 1/2, 1990  pp. 132–49. {{jstor|4431893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1210 BC, the first recorded naval battle was fought between [[Suppiluliuma II]], king of the [[Hittites]], and [[Cyprus]], which was defeated. In the [[Persian Wars]], the navy became of increasing importance.

[[Trireme]]s were involved in more complicated sea-land operations. [[Themistocles]] helped to build up a stronger Greek navy, composed of 310 ships, and defeated the Persians at the [[Battle of Salamis]], ending the Persian invasion of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Moerbeek, Martijn (January 21, 1998). [https://web.archive.org/web/20020514151335/http://monolith.dnsalias.org/~marsares/warfare/battle/salamis.html "The battle of Salamis, 480 BC"] Accessed May 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[First Punic War]], the war between [[Carthage]] and Rome started with an advantage to Carthage because of their naval experience. A Roman fleet was built in 261 BC, with the addition of the [[Corvus (weapon)|corvus]] that allowed Roman soldiers on board the ships to board the enemy ships. The bridge would prove effective at the [[Battle of Mylae]], resulting in a Roman victory.

The [[Vikings]], in the 8th century AD, invented a ship propelled by oars with a dragon decorating the prow, hence called the [[Drekar|Drakkar]]. The 12th century AD [[Song Dynasty]] invented ships with watertight bulk head compartments while the 2nd century BC [[Han Dynasty]] invented rudders and sculled oars for their warships.

[[Fortification]]s are important in warfare. Early [[hill-fort]]s were used to protect inhabitants in the [[Iron Age]]. They were primitive forts surrounded by ditches filled with water.  Forts were then built out of mud bricks, stones, wood, and other available materials. Romans used rectangular fortresses built out of wood and stone. As long as there have been fortifications, there have been contraptions to break in, dating back to the times of [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and earlier. [[Siege]] warfare is often necessary to capture forts.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.timeref.com/casterly.htm "The Medieval Castle"]. Accessed May 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle-ages===
[[File:Takezaki suenaga ekotoba3.jpg|thumb|240px|Japanese [[samurai]] boarding [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] ships in 1281]]
Some of the military unit types and technologies which were used in the medieval period are:
* [[Artillery]]
* [[Cataphract]]
* [[Condottieri]]
* [[Fyrd]]
* [[Rashidun army|Rashidun]]
* [[Mobile guard]]
* [[Mamluk]]
* [[Janissary]]
* [[Knight]] (see also: [[Chivalry]])
* [[Crossbow]]
* [[Pikeman]]
* [[Samurai]]
* [[Sipahi]]
* [[Trebuchet]]

[[Bow (weapon)|Bows]] and [[Arrow (weapon)|arrows]] were often used by combatants. Egyptians shot arrows from chariots effectively. The [[crossbow]] was developed around 500 BC in China, and was used a lot in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Selby, Stephen (2001). [http://www.atarn.org/chinese/bjng_xbow/bjng_xbow.htm "A Crossbow Mechanism with Some Unique Features from Shandong, China"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518053806/http://www.atarn.org/chinese/bjng_xbow/bjng_xbow.htm |date=2008-05-18 }}. Accessed on May 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The English/Welsh [[longbow]] from the 12th century also became important in the Middle Ages. It helped to give the English a large early advantage in the [[Hundred Years' War]], even though the English were eventually defeated. The [[Battle of Crécy]] and the [[Battle of Agincourt]] are excellent examples of how to destroy an enemy using a longbow. It dominated battlefields for over a century.

===The rise of gunpowder===
[[File:Cannon pic.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A small [[English Civil War]]-era cannon]]
In the 10th century, the invention of gunpowder led to many new weapons that were improved over time. [[Black powder]] was used in China since the 4th century, but it was not used as a weapon until the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Brenda J. Buchanan, ed., ''Gunpowder, explosives and the state: a technological history'' (Ashgate, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  Until the mid-15th century, guns were held in one hand, while the [[explosive charge]] was ignited by the other hand. Then came the [[matchlock]], which was used widely until around the 1720s. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] made drawings of the [[wheel lock]] which made its own sparks. Eventually, the matchlock was replaced by the [[flintlock]].  [[Cannon]]s were first used in Europe in the early 14th century, and played a vital role in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. The first cannons were simply welded metal bars in the form of a cylinder, and the first cannonballs were made of stone. By 1346, at the Battle of Crécy, the cannon had been used; at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] they would be used again.&lt;ref&gt;Calvert, J.B. (February 19, 2006) [http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/cannon.htm "Cannons and Gunpowder"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701172502/http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/cannon.htm |date=2007-07-01 }}. Accessed on May 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.C.B. Rogers, ''A History of Artillery'' (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 16th century, the first European [[fire ship]]s were used. Ships were filled with flammable materials, set on fire, and sent to enemy lines. This tactic was successfully used by [[Francis Drake]] to scatter the [[Spanish Armada]] at the Battle of [[Gravelines]],&lt;ref&gt;Jorge. [http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/defeat_of_the_armada.htm The "Invincible" Armada]. Accessed on May 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and would later be used by the Chinese, Russians, Greeks, and several other countries in naval battles.

[[Naval mines]] were invented in the 17th century, though they were not used in great numbers until the [[American Civil War]]. They were used heavily in the [[First World War|First]] and Second World Wars. Air-deployed naval mines were used to mine the [[North Vietnamese]] port of [[Haiphong]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. The [[Iraqi Navy]] of [[Saddam Hussein]] used naval mines extensively during the [[Tanker War]], as part of the [[Iran–Iraq War]].

The first navigable [[submarine]] was built in 1624 by [[Cornelius Drebbel]], it could cruise at a depth of 15 feet (5&amp;nbsp;m). However, the first military submarine was constructed in 1885 by [[Isaac Peral]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Parrish, ''The Submarine: A History'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Turtle|''Turtle'']] was developed by [[David Bushnell]] during the [[American Revolution]]. [[Robert Fulton]] then improved the submarine design by creating the [[Nautilus (submarine)|''Nautilus'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060217031100/http://submarinehistory.homestead.com/EarlyUnderwaterwarfare.html |archivedate=February 17, 2006 |title=Early Underwater Warfare |url=http://submarinehistory.homestead.com/EarlyUnderwaterwarfare.html |date=May 18, 2006 |publisher=California Center for Military History |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:155fire.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A 155&amp;nbsp;mm [[M198 howitzer]] firing a shell.]]
The [[Howitzer]], a type of [[field artillery]], was developed in the 17th century to fire high trajectory explosive shells at targets that could not be reached by flat trajectory projectiles.

Organizational changes resulting in better training and intercommunication, made the concept [[combined arms]] possible, allowing the use of infantry, cavalry, and [[artillery]] in a coordinated way.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Bayonets also became of wide usage to infantry soldiers. [[Bayonet]] is named after [[Bayonne]], France where it was first manufactured in the 16th century. It is used often in infantry charges to fight in hand-to-hand combat. General [[Jean Martinet]] introduced the bayonet to the French army. They were used heavily in the [[American Civil War]], and continued to be used in modern wars like the [[Invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Brayley, ''Bayonets: An Illustrated History'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Balloon (aircraft)|Balloons]] were first used in warfare at the end of the 18th century. It was first introduced in Paris of 1783; the first balloon traveled over 5&amp;nbsp;miles (8&amp;nbsp;km). Previously military [[Reconnaissance|scouts]] could only see from high points on the ground, or from the mast of a ship. Now they could be high in the sky, signalling to troops on the ground. This made it much more difficult for troop movements to go unobserved.&lt;ref&gt;John Christopher, ''Balloons at War: Gasbags, Flying Bombs &amp; Cold War Secrets'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 18th century, iron-cased [[artillery rocket]]s were successfully used militarily in India against the British by [[Tipu Sultan]] of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] during the [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. Rockets were generally inaccurate at that time, though [[William Hale (British inventor)|William Hale]], in 1844, was able to develop a better rocket. The new rocket no longer needed the [[rocket stick]], and had a higher accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;HM Iftekhar Jaim, and Jasmine Jaim, "The Decisive Nature of the Indian War Rocket in the Anglo-Mysore Wars of the Eighteenth Century." ''Arms &amp; Armour'' 8.2 (2011): 131–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s there were a series of advancements in [[rifle]]s. The first [[repeating rifle]] was designed in 1860 by a company bought out by [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]], which made new and improved versions. [[Springfield rifle]]s arrived in the mid-19th century also. [[Machine gun]]s arrived in the late 19th century. [[Automatic rifle]]s and [[light machine gun]]s first arrived at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Held, ''The Age of Firearms: a pictorial history.'' (Harper, 1957).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later part of the 19th century, the self-propelled [[torpedo]] was developed. The [[HNoMS Rap (1873)|HNoMS Rap]] was the world's first torpedo boat.&lt;ref&gt;George Elliot Armstrong, ''Torpedoes and Torpedo-vessels'' (1896) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=YDzWQbUP3sUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=History+Torpedo+Armstrong&amp;ots=Yi8gMyNBO_&amp;sig=bDvs5yoMT1OCwmQ-12xIoHeh_co online].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern technologies===
At the start of the World Wars, various nations had developed weapons that were a surprise to their adversaries, leading to a need to learn from this, and alter how to combat them. [[Flame thrower]]s were first used in the First World War. The French were the first to introduce the [[Armored car (military)|armored car]] in 1902. Then in 1918, the British produced the first [[Armoured personnel carrier|armored troop carrier]]. Many early [[tank]]s were proof of concept but impractical until further development. In World War I, the British and French held a crucial advantage due to their superiority in tanks; the Germans had only a few dozen A&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;V tanks, as well as 170 captured tanks. The British and French both had several hundred each. The French tanks included the 13 ton [[Schneider-Creusot]], with a 75&amp;nbsp;mm gun, and the British had the [[Mark I tank#Mark IV|Mark IV]] and [[Mark I tank#Mark V series|Mark V]] tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Wright, ''Tank: the progress of a monstrous war machine'' (Penguin, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 17, 1903, the [[Wright Brothers]] performed the first controlled, powered, heavier-than-air flight; it went 39 meters (120&amp;nbsp;ft). In 1907, the first [[helicopter]] flew, but it wasn't practical for usage. [[World War I Aviation|Aviation]] became important in World War I, in which several [[Flying ace|aces]] gained fame. In 1911 an aircraft took off from a warship for the first time. Landings on a cruiser were another matter. This led to the development of an [[aircraft carrier]] with a decent unobstructed flight deck.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Polmar, ''Aircraft carriers: a graphic history of carrier aviation and its influence on world events'' (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chemical warfare]] exploded into the public consciousness in World War I but may have been used in earlier wars without as much human attention. The Germans used gas-filled shells at the [[Battle of Bolimov]] on January 3, 1915. These were not lethal, however. In April 1915, the Germans developed a chlorine gas that was highly lethal, and used it to moderate effect at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]]. Gas masks were invented in matter of weeks, and poison gas proved ineffective at winning battles. It was made illegal by all nations in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Coleman, ''A history of chemical warfare'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

World War II gave rise to even more technology. The worth of the aircraft carrier was proved in the battles between the United States and Japan like the [[Battle of Midway]]. [[Radar]] was independently invented by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and [[Axis Powers|Axis powers]]. It used [[radio wave]]s to detect objects. [[Molotov cocktail]]s were invented by General Franco in the Spanish Civil War, directing the Nationalists to use them against Soviet tanks in the assault on Toledo. The [[atomic bomb]] was developed by the [[Manhattan Project]] and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945, quickly ending World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Jenkins, ''World War 2: New Technologies'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], the main powers engaged in a [[Nuclear arms race]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul P. Craig and John A. Jungerman, ''The Nuclear Arms Race: Technology and Society'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[space race]], both nations attempted to launch human beings into space to the moon. Other technological advances centered on intelligence (like the [[spy satellite]]) and missiles ([[ballistic missile]]s, [[cruise missile]]s). [[Nuclear submarine]], invented in 1955. This meant submarines no longer had to surface as often, and could run more quietly. They evolved into becoming underwater missile platforms.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, ''The Cold War: A Military History'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Periods of military history==
The influence of technology on military history, and evident Eurocentrism are nowhere more pronounced than in the attempt by the military historians to divide their subject area into more manageable [[Periodization|periods]] of analysis. While general discipline of history subdivides history into Ancient history (Classical antiquity), Middle Ages (Europe, 4th century – 15th century), Early Modern period (Europe, 14th century – 18th century), Modern era (Europe, 18th century – 20th century), and the Post-Modern (USA, 1949–present), the periodisation below stresses technological change in its emphasis, particularly the crucial dramatic change during the Gunpowder warfare period.

Periodisation is not uniformly applied through time and space, affirming the claims of Eurocentrism from regional historians. For example, what might be described as [[prehistoric warfare]] is still practised in a few parts of the world. Other eras that are distinct in European history, such as the era of [[medieval warfare]], may have little relevance in East Asia.

===Ancient warfare===
{{details|Ancient warfare}}

Much of what we know of [[ancient history]] is the history of militaries: their conquests, their movements, and their technological innovations. There are many reasons for this. Kingdoms and empires, the central units of control in the ancient world, could only be maintained through military force. Due to limited agricultural ability, there were relatively few areas that could support large communities, so fighting was common.

[[Weapon]]s and [[armor]], designed to be sturdy, tended to last longer than other artifacts, and thus a great deal of surviving artifacts recovered tend to fall in this category as they are more likely to survive. Weapons and armor were also mass-produced to a scale that makes them quite plentiful throughout history, and thus more likely to be found in archaeological digs.

Such items were also considered signs of prosperity or virtue, and thus were likely to be placed in tombs and monuments to prominent warriors. And writing, when it existed, was often used for kings to boast of military conquests or victories.

Writing, when used by the common man, also tended to record such events, as major battles and conquests constituted major events that many would have considered worthy of recording either in an epic such as the [[Homeric]] writings pertaining to the Trojan War, or even personal writings. Indeed, the earliest stories center on warfare, as war was both a common and dramatic aspect of life; the witnessing of a major battle involving many thousands of soldiers would be quite a spectacle, even today, and thus considered worthy both of being recorded in song and art, but also in realistic histories, as well as being a central element in a fictional work.

Lastly, as [[nation states]] evolved and empires grew, the increased need for order and efficiency lead to an increase in the number of records and writings. Officials and armies would have good reason for keeping detailed records and accounts involving any and all things concerning a matter such as warfare that in the words of [[Sun Tzu]] was "a matter of vital importance to the state". For all these reasons, military history comprises a large part of ancient history.

Notable militaries in the ancient world included the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Babylon]]ians, [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] (notably the [[Sparta]]ns and [[Macedon]]ians), [[Military history of India|Indians]] (notably the [[Magadha]]s, [[Gangaridai]]s, [[Gandhara]]s and [[Cholas]]), Early Imperial [[History of China|Chinese]] (notably the [[Qin (state)|Qin]] and [[Han (state)|Han]] Dynasties), [[Xiongnu]] Confederation, Ancient [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]].

The [[fertile crescent]] of [[Mesopotamia]] was the center of several prehistoric conquests. Mesopotamia was conquered by the [[Sumer]]ians, [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]], [[Babylonia]]ns, [[Assyria]]ns and Persians. [[Iran]]ians were the first nation to introduce [[cavalry]] into their army.&lt;ref name="Suren-Pahlav"&gt;Suren-Pahlav S., ''General Surena; The Hero of Carrhae''&lt;!-- link blocked by spam filter: http://www.cais-soas.com/CAIS/History/ashkanian/surena.htm ; accessed Jan 16, 2007 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Egypt]] began growing as an ancient power, but eventually fell to the [[Libya]]ns, [[Nubia]]ns, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and [[Arab]]s.

The earliest recorded battle in [[History of India|India]] was the [[Battle of the Ten Kings]]. The [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Ramayana]]'' are centered on conflicts and refer to military formations, theories of warfare and esoteric weaponry. [[Chanakya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]'' contains a detailed study on ancient warfare, including topics on [[espionage]] and [[war elephant]]s.

[[Alexander the Great]] invaded Northwestern India and defeated [[King Porus]] in the [[Battle of the Hydaspes River]]. The same region was soon re conquered by [[Chandragupta Maurya]] after defeating the Macedonians and [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]]. He also went on to conquer the [[Nanda Dynasty|Nanda Empire]] and unify Northern India. Most of Southern Asia was unified under his grandson [[Ashoka|Ashoka the Great]] after the [[Kalinga War]], though the empire collapsed not long after his reign.

In China, the [[Shang Dynasty]] and [[Zhou Dynasty]] had risen and collapsed. This led to a [[Warring States period]], in which several states continued to fight with each other over territory. Philosopher-strategists such as [[Confucius]] and [[Sun Tzu]] wrote various manuscripts on ancient warfare (as well as international diplomacy).

The Warring States era philosopher [[Mozi]] ([[Micius]]) and his [[Mohist]] followers invented various siege weapons and siegecraft, including the Cloud Ladder (a four-wheeled, extendable ramp) to scale fortified walls during a siege of an enemy city. The warring states were first unified by [[Qin Shi Huang]] after a series of military conquests, creating the first empire in China.

His [[Qin Dynasty|empire]] was succeeded by the [[Han Dynasty]], which expanded into Central [[Asia]], Northern China/Manchuria, Southern China, and present day Korea and Vietnam. The Han came into conflict with settled people such as the [[Wiman Joseon]], and proto-Vietnamese Nanyue. They also came into conflict with the [[Xiongnu]] ([[Huns]]), [[Yuezhi]], and other steppe civilizations.

The Han defeated and drove the Xiongnus west, securing the city-states along the silk route that continued into the [[Parthia]]n Empire. After the decline of central imperial authority, the Han Dynasty collapsed into an era of civil war and continuous warfare during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period in the 3rd century AD.

The [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] Persian Empire was founded by [[Cyrus the Great]] after conquering the [[Medes|Median Empire]], [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], [[Lydia]] and [[Asia Minor]]. His successor [[Cambyses II of Persia|Cambyses]] went on to conquer the [[Egyptian Empire]], much of Central Asia, and parts of Greece, India and Libya. The empire later fell to Alexander the Great after defeating [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III]]. After being ruled by the Seleucid dynasty, the Persian Empire was subsequently ruled by the Parthian and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] dynasties, which were the [[Roman Empire]]'s greatest rivals during the [[Roman-Persian Wars]].

In [[Greece]], several [[city-state]]s rose to power, including [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]]. The Greeks successfully stopped two Persian invasions, the first at the [[Battle of Marathon]], where the Persians were led by [[Darius I of Persia|Darius the Great]], and the second at the [[Battle of Salamis]], a naval battle where the Greek ships were deployed by orders of [[Themistocles]] and the Persians were under [[Xerxes I]], and the land engagement of the [[Battle of Plataea]].

The [[Peloponnesian War]] then erupted between the two Greek powers Athens and Sparta. Athens built a long wall to protect its inhabitants, but the wall helped to facilitate the spread of a plague that killed about 30,000 Athenians, including [[Pericles]]. After a disastrous campaign against [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], the Athenian navy was decisively defeated by [[Lysander]] at the [[Battle of Aegospotami]].

The [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], underneath [[Philip II of Macedon]] and Alexander the Great, invaded Persia and won several major victories, establishing Macedonia as a major power. However, following Alexander's death at an early age, the empire quickly fell apart.

[[File:Grande Ludovisi Altemps Inv8574.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The 3rd-century [[Great Ludovisi sarcophagus]] depicts a battle between [[Military of ancient Rome|Romans]] and [[Goths]].]]
Meanwhile, Rome was gaining power, following a rebellion against the [[Etruscans]]. During the three [[Punic Wars]], the Romans defeated the neighboring power of Carthage. The [[First Punic War]] centered on [[naval warfare]]. The [[Second Punic War]] started with [[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal]]'s invasion of Italy by crossing the [[Alps]]. He famously won the encirclement at the [[Battle of Cannae]]. However, after [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]] invaded Carthage, Hannibal was forced to follow and was defeated at the [[Battle of Zama]], ending the role of Carthage as a power.

After defeating Carthage the Romans went on to become the Mediterranean's dominant power, successfully campaigning in Greece, ([[Aemilius Paulus]] decisive victory over Macedonia at the [[Battle of Pydna]]), in the Middle East ([[Lucullus|Lucius Licinius Lucullus]], [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]]), in [[Gaul]] ([[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]]) and defeating several [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] ([[Gaius Marius]], [[Germanicus]]). While Roman armies suffered several major losses, their large population and ability (and will) to replace battlefield casualties, their training, organization, tactical and technical superiority enabled Rome to stay a predominant military force for several centuries, utilizing well trained and maneuverable armies to routinely overcome the much larger "tribal" armies of their foes (see Battles of [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae|Aquae Sextiae]], [[Battle of Vercellae|Vercellae]], [[Battle of Tigranocerta|Tigranocerta]], [[Battle of Alesia|Alesia]]).

In 54 BC the Roman triumvir [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] took the offensive against the [[Parthian Empire]] in the east. In a decisive battle at [[Battle of Carrhae|Carrhae]] Romans were defeated and the golden [[Aquila (Roman)|Aquilae]] (legionary battle standards) were taken as trophies to [[Ctesiphon]]. The battle was one of the worst defeats suffered by the Roman Republic in its entire history.

While successfully dealing with foreign opponents, Rome experienced numerous civil wars, notably the power struggles of Roman generals such as Marius and [[Sulla]] during the end of the Republic. Caesar was also notable for his role in the civil war against the other member of the Triumvirate (Pompey) and against the Roman Senate.

The successors of Caesar&amp;nbsp;– Octavian and Mark Anthony, also fought a civil war with Caesar's assassins (Senators Brutus, Cassius, etc.). Octavian and Mark Anthony eventually fought another civil war between themselves to determine the sole ruler of Rome. Octavian emerged victorious and Rome was turned into an empire with a huge standing army of professional soldiers.

By the time of [[Marcus Aurelius]], the Romans had expanded to the Atlantic Ocean in the west and to [[Mesopotamia]] in the east and controlled Northern Africa and Central Europe up to the [[Black Sea]]. However, Aurelius marked the end of the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty#Five Good Emperors|Five Good Emperors]], and Rome quickly fell into decline.

The [[Hun]]s, [[Goths]], and other barbaric groups invaded Rome, which continued to suffer from [[inflation]] and other internal strifes. Despite the attempts of [[Diocletian]], [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]], and [[Theodosius I]], western Rome collapsed and was eventually conquered in 476. The [[Byzantium|Byzantine empire]] continued to prosper, however.

===Medieval warfare===
{{details|Medieval warfare}}
[[File:Battle of crecy froissart.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Battle of Crécy]] (1346) between the English and French in the [[Hundred Years' War]].]]
When [[stirrups]] came into use some time during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] militaries were forever changed. This invention coupled with technological, cultural, and social developments had forced a dramatic transformation in the character of warfare from [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], changing military tactics and the role of [[cavalry]] and [[artillery]].

Similar patterns of warfare existed in other parts of the world. In China around the 5th century armies moved from massed infantry to cavalry based forces, copying the [[steppe]] [[nomad]]s. The Middle East and North Africa used similar, if often more advanced, technologies than Europe.

In Japan the Medieval warfare period is considered by many to have stretched into the 19th century. In Africa along the [[Sahel]] and [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] states like the [[Kingdom of Sennar]] and [[Fulani Empire]] employed Medieval tactics and weapons well after they had been supplanted in Europe.

In the [[Medieval]] period, [[feudalism]] was firmly implanted, and there existed many landlords in Europe. Landlords often owned [[castle]]s to protect their territory.

The Islamic [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] began rapidly expanding throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia, initially led by [[Rashidun Caliphate]], and later under the [[Umayyads]]. While their attempts to invade Europe by way of the Balkans were [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|defeated]] by [[Byzantium]] and [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]],&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Great Battles of Bulgaria]]&lt;/ref&gt; the Arabs expanded to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the west and the [[Indus River|Indus Valley]] in the east. The [[Abassid]]s then took over the Arab Empire, though the Umayyads remained in control of [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]].

At the [[Battle of Tours]], the [[Franks]] under [[Charles Martel]] stopped short a Muslim invasion. The Abassids defeated the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] Chinese army at the [[Battle of Talas]], but were later defeated by the [[Seljuk Turk]]s and the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] centuries later, until the Arab Empire eventually came to an end after the [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|Battle of Baghdad]] in 1258.

In China, the [[Sui Dynasty]] had risen and conquered the Chen Dynasty of the south. They invaded Vietnam (northern Vietnam had been in Chinese control since the Han Dynasty), fighting the troops of [[Champa]], who had cavalry mounted on elephants. After decades of economic turmoil and a [[Goguryeo-Sui Wars|failed invasion of Korea]], the Sui collapsed and was followed by the Tang Dynasty, who fought with various [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] groups, the [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] of [[Lhasa]], the [[Tanguts]], the [[Khitans]], and collapsed due to political fragmentation of powerful regional military governors (jiedushi). The innovative [[Song Dynasty]] followed next, inventing new weapons of war that employed the use of [[Greek Fire]] and [[gunpowder]] (see section below) against enemies such as the [[Jurchens]].
[[File:Autor nieznany (malarz z kręgu Lukasa Cranacha Starszego), Bitwa pod Orszą.jpg|thumb|The victory of the [[Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars|Polish-Lithuanian]] forces over the Muscovites at the [[Battle of Orsha]] in 1514]]

The [[Mongol]]s under [[Genghis Khan]], [[Ögedei Khan]], [[Möngke Khan]], and [[Kublai Khan]] conquered most of Eurasia. They took over China, Persia, Turkestan, and Russia. After Kublai Khan took power and created the [[Yuan Dynasty]], the divisions of the empire ceased to cooperate with each other, and the Mongol Empire was only nominally united.

In New Zealand, prior to European discovery, oral histories, legends and [[whakapapa]] include many stories of battles and wars. [[Māori people|Māori]] warriors were held in high esteem. One group of [[Polynesians]] migrated to the [[Chatham Islands]], where they developed the largely pacifist [[Moriori people|Moriori]] culture. Their pacifism left the Moriori unable to defend themselves when the islands were invaded by mainland Māori in the 1830s.

They proceeded to massacre the Moriori and enslave the survivors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/MaoriNewZealanders/Moriori/4/en "Moriori - The impact of new arrivals"] ''Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newzealandatoz.com/index.php?pageid=607&amp;PHPSESSID=1c2fab7979e45ccc7c3e7336e8636142 "Chatham Islands"] ''New Zealand A to Z''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warrior]] culture also developed in the isolated [[Hawaiian Islands]]. During the 1780s and 1790s the chiefs and alii were constantly fighting for power. After a series of battles the Hawaiian Islands were united for the first time under a single ruler who would become known as [[Kamehameha I]].

===Gunpowder warfare===
{{details|Gunpowder warfare}}
[[File:Batalla Sebastian Vranckx.jpg|thumb|[[Eighty Years' War]], or [[Dutch Revolt]] against Spain]]
After [[gunpowder]] weapons were first developed in [[Song Dynasty]] China (see also [[Technology of Song Dynasty]]), the technology later spread west to the [[Ottoman Empire]], from where it spread to the [[Safavid Empire]] of Persia and the [[Mughal Empire]] of India. The [[arquebus]] was later adopted by European armies during the [[Italian Wars]] of the early 16th century.

This all brought an end to the dominance of armored cavalry on the battlefield. The simultaneous decline of the feudal system&amp;nbsp;– and the absorption of the medieval city-states into larger states&amp;nbsp;– allowed the creation of professional standing armies to replace the [[Feudalism|feudal levies]] and mercenaries that had been the standard military component of the Middle Ages.

In Africa, [[Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi]], was the first African commander to use gunpowder on the continent in the [[Ethiopian–Adal War]], that lasted for fourteen years (1529–1543).

The period spanning between the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]] and the 1789 [[French Revolution]] is also known as ''[[Kabinettskriege]]'' (Princes' warfare) as wars were mainly carried out by imperial or monarchics states, decided by cabinets and limited in scope and in their aims. They also involved quickly shifting alliances, and mainly used mercenaries.

Over the course of the 18th-19th centuries all military arms and services underwent significant developments that included a more mobile [[field artillery]], the transition from use of battalion [[infantry drill]] in [[close order formation|close order]] to open order formations and the transfer of emphasis from the use of [[bayonets]] to the rifle that replaced the musket, and virtual replacement of all types of cavalry with the universal [[dragoons]], or [[mounted infantry]].

===Industrial warfare===
{{details|Industrial warfare}}
[[File:Bataille Lizaine.jpg|thumb|[[Franco-Prussian War]]]]
As weapons—particularly small arms—became easier to use, countries began to abandon a complete reliance on professional soldiers in favor of [[conscription]]. Technological advances became increasingly important; while the armies of the previous period had usually had similar weapons, the industrial age saw encounters such as the [[Battle of Sadowa]], in which possession of a more advanced technology played a decisive role in the outcome.

Conscription was employed in industrial warfare to increase the number of military personnel that were available for combat. This was notably used by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and by almost all parties during the two World Wars.

[[Total war]] was used in industrial warfare, the objective being to prevent the opposing nation to engage in war. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s "[[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]" and [[Philip Sheridan]]'s burning of the [[Shenandoah Valley]] during the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing of enemy cities and industrial factories]] during [[World War II]] are examples of total warfare.

===Modern warfare===
{{Original research section|date=March 2016}}
{{details|Modern warfare}}

In modern times, war has evolved from an activity steeped in tradition to a [[scientific enterprise]] where success is valued above methods. The notion of [[total war]] is the extreme of this trend.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} Militaries have developed technological advances rivaling the scientific accomplishments of any other field of study.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} Modern militaries benefit in the development of these technologies under the funding of the [[public]], the leadership of [[Central government|national governments]]. What distinguishes modern military organizations from those previous is not their willingness to prevail in conflict by any method, but rather the technological variety of tools and methods available to modern [[battlefield]] commanders, from [[submarine]]s to [[satellite]]s, from knives to [[nuclear warheads]].

The term "MEI", like "TEI", describes the governing organization and the markup language. The MEI community solicits input and development directions from specialists in various music research communities, including technologists, librarians, historians, and theorists in a common effort to discuss and define best practices for representing a broad range of musical documents and structures. The results of these discussions are then formalized into the MEI schema, a core set of rules for recording physical and intellectual characteristics of music notation documents. This schema is expressed in an [[XML Schema]] Language, with [[RelaxNG]] being the preferred format.  The MEI schema is developed using the One-Document-Does-it-all (ODD) format, a [[literate programming]] XML format developed by the Text Encoding Initiative.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16090">The '''New Engineering Contract''' ('''NEC'''), or '''NEC Engineering and Construction Contract''', is a formalised system created by the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] that guides the [[Legal writing|drafting]] of documents on [[civil engineering]] and [[construction|construction projects]] for the purpose of obtaining [[Call for bids|tenders]], awarding and administering [[contracts]].&lt;ref&gt;R Gerard (2005). [http://www.leanconstruction.org/lcj/V2_N1/LCJ_05_006.pdf Relational contracts—NEC in perspective]. Lean Construction Journal, 2, 80-86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brook M. (2004). Estimating and Tendering for Construction Work Butterworth-Heinemann {{ISBN|978-0-7506-5864-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such they [[Law#Contract law|legally]] define the responsibilities and duties of Employers (who commission work) and [[Contractors]] (who carry out work) in the Works Information. The contract consists of two key parts the Contract Data part one (Data provided by the Employer) and Contract Data part two (Data provided by the Contractor).  Several approaches are included making it a family of options. It is used in the [[UK]] and internationally in countries including [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Patterson R (2007) [http://www.neccontract.com/documents/events/Introducing%20NEC%20-%20R%20Patterson.pdf Introducing NEC Wellington Seminar]&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been four editions, the first in 1993, the second in 1995, the third in 2005 and the most recent in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.neccontract.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The NEC3 was launched in 2005 and it was amended in April 2013.

NEC4 was announced in March 2017 and has been available since June 2017. This new edition reflects procurement and project management developments and emerging best practice, with improvements in flexibility, clarity and the ease of administration. It also introduces two new contracts: NEC4 Design, Build and Operate (DBO) and NEC4 Alliance Contract (ALC).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.neccontract.com/About-NEC/News-Media/NEC4-the-next-generation-of-NEC-Contracts&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The NEC is a family of standard contracts, each of which has these characteristics:

* Its use stimulates good management of the relationship between the two parties to the contract and, hence, of the work included in the contract.
* It can be used in a wide variety of commercial situations, for a wide variety of types of work and in any location.
* It is a clear and simple document - using language and a structure which are straightforward and easily understood.

The NEC3 complies fully with the [http://www.ogc.gov.uk/guidance_achieving_excellence_in_construction.asp Achieving Excellence in Construction] (AEC) principles. The Efficiency &amp; Reform Group of The UK Cabinet Office recommends the use of NEC3 by public sector construction procurers on their construction projects.

==Options==

The NEC contracts now form a suite of contracts, with NEC being the brand name for the "umbrella" of contracts. When it was first launched in 1993, it was simply the "New Engineering Contract". This specific contract has been renamed the "Engineering and Construction Contract" which is the main contract used for any construction based project. It now sits alongside a number of other contracts that together should mean that the NEC suite is suitable for what ever stage of a lifecycle the project is at and for any party within a project. The contracts available within the suite are:

'''Engineering and Construction Contract (ECC)''':
 
Suitable for any construction based contract between an Employer and a Contractor. It is intended to be suitable for any sector of the industry, including civil, building, nuclear, oil &amp; gas, etc. 
Within the ECC contract there are six family level options of which the Employer will choose what she/he deems to be the most suitable and give her/him the best option/value for money on that project:

* Option A: Priced contract with activity schedule
* Option B: Priced contract with bill of quantities
* Option C: Target contract with activity schedule
* Option D: Target contract with bill of quantities
* Option E: Cost-reimbursable contract
* Option F: Management contract

These options offer a framework for tender and contract clauses that differ primarily in regard to the mechanisms by which the contractor is paid and how risk is allocated/motivated to control costs.

The core clauses (of the main option listed above) are used in conjunction with the secondary options and the additional conditions of contract. The Efficiency and Reform group of The Cabinet Office in the UK (formerly the OGC) has published generic [http://www.ogc.gov.uk/documents/PublicSectorZClausesForUseWithNEC3Contracts.pdf public sector Z-clauses for the use with '''NEC3''' contracts].

The clauses of these options have been be adapted for simpler less risky work (short contracts), for use as subcontracts, and for professional services such as design as below.

'''The Engineering and Construction Subcontract Contract (ECS)'''

Very similar in detail and complexity of contractual requirements to the ECC contract above, but allows the contractor to sub-let the project to a subcontractor imposing most of the clauses that she/he has within her/his headline contract. There is very little difference between the ECC and the ECS, other than the names of the parties are changed (contractor and subcontractor)and some of the timescales for contractual responses are altered to take into account the timescales required in the ECC contract.

'''The Engineering and Construction Short Contract (ECSC)'''

This is an abbreviated version of the ECC contract and most suitable when the contract is considered "low risk" (not necessarily low value) on a project with little change expected. This contract is still between the employer and contractor but does not use all of the processes of the ECC making it simpler and easier to manage and administer.

'''The Engineering and Construction Short Subcontract (ECSS)'''

Allows the contractor to sub-let a simpler lower risk contract down the line to a subcontractor. It is back-to-back with the ECSC but is frequently used as subcontract when the main contract is under the ECS.

'''The Professional Services Contract (PSC)'''

This contract is for anyone providing a service, rather than doing any physical construction works. Designers are the most obvious party that fit into this category. Whilst they are producing a design for an employer or contractor, they would sign up and follow the clauses within the PSC. Most of the clauses within this contract are the same or similar to those in the main ECC contract, so that all contractors, designers and subcontractors have pretty much the same obligations and processes to follow as each other.

'''The Professional Services Short Contract (PSSC)'''

This was added to the family in April 2013 and was co-developed with the Association for Project Management. It is for simpler less complex assignments than the PSC, such as the appointment of small team for managing an ECC contract on the Employer's behalf. E.g. the Project Manager and Supervisor. It is frequently used as a subcontract to the PSC for design work.

'''Framework Contract (FC)'''

Parties enter into a "framework" of which work packages will then be let during the life of that framework. Any individual projects will then be awarded using one of the other contracts within the suite, meaning that the parties follow the headline clauses within the framework contract (which is a fairly slim contract) and then the individual clauses within the chosen contract for that package. Different work packages can be let using different contracts during the life of the framework.

'''Term Service Contract (TSC)'''

For parties on a project that is operational or maintenance based, e.g. maintaining highway signage, where the contract is to ensure that a certain standard is maintained. This contract is not generally used for constructing new works, but can include some amount of betterment. There is also a "Term Service Short Contract" where the project is a relatively low risk project and/or the work is primarily re-active. It is an abbreviated version of the main TSC.

'''Supply Contract/Short Supply Contract (SC/SSC)'''

These contracts were launched in 2010. This is for a supplier of supplies or goods to a project, and puts extra contractual requirements on them during their procurement/manufacture period. The Supply Contract is for big bespoke items i.e. designed and manufactured specifically for that contract, with the Short Supply Contract potentially being for more run of the mill / commoditised items on a project. Neither of these contracts cover working on a Site. I.e. as written they are not 'supply and install' contracts.

'''Dispute Resolution Services Contract (DRSC) - previously Adjudicator's Contract'''

If there is a dispute between the parties on a project then the Adjudicator will follow the clauses within this contract in order to come to a decision.

'''Design Build and Operate (DBO)'''

The NEC4 Design, Build and Operate Contract (DBO) allows the procurement of a more integrated whole-life delivery solution. It combines responsibility for design, construction, operation and/or maintenance, procured from a single supplier.

It can include a range of different services to be provided before, during and after engineering and construction works are completed.

'''Alliance Contract (ALC)'''
The NEC4 Alliance Contract (ALC) will be published initially in a consultation form. It was created to support Clients who wish to take a step forward by fully integrating the delivery team for large complex projects.

The ALC should be used to engage in a single collaborative contract with a number of participants in order to deliver a project or programme of work. The basis of the contract will be that all parties work together in achieving Client objectives, and share in the risks and benefits of doing so.	

'''Guidance Notes and Flowcharts'''

For each of the different contracts listed above each comes with its own set of guidance notes and flowcharts which should aid understanding of the intent of the drafted clauses. The guidance notes expand on each clause to give extra substance and intent of the original drafters as to how a clause should be understood and interpreted. The flowcharts then map out each of the main processes within each contract and demonstrate how it should operate and what to do next if a party has or has not carried out the next contractual action.

==History==

Originally contracts in the civil engineering and construction industries were bespoke and drafted by [[Inns of Chancery|Chancery]] [[Special pleader|pleaders]] using their knowledge of [[leases]] rather than building processes. In 1879, [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] for construction projects created RIBA forms which lead to the [[Joint Contracts Tribunal]], JCT forms. For civil engineering the need for a formalized approach to contracts led the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] to produce the ICE formalized set of conditions of contract. In 1986, the ICE commissioned the development of a new form of contract as it was felt that there was a need for a form that had clearer language, clearer allocation of responsibilities and reduced opportunities for contractual “gamesmanship”. In 1991, this resulted in a consultative form of the New Engineering Contract form of contract. The first edition was published in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Broome JC, Hayes RW. (1997). A comparison of the clarity of traditional construction contracts and of the New Engineering Contract. International Journal of Project Management, 15, 255-261. {{doi|10.1016/S0263-7863(96)00078-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wider use of the NEC was recommended by the [[Latham Report]] in 1994.

NEC's history started in 1986 when [[Martin Barnes]] was commissioned to start drafting a contract to stimulated good project management.

The first edition of NEC was launched in 1993. NEC2 arrived two years later, in 1995. NEC2 was used to build the High Speed 1 railway, between London and the Channel Tunnel.

The NEC3 suite was launched in 2005 and it was fully revised in 2013 - NEC's 20th anniversary. This suite was used in projects such as Crossrail, London 2012 Olympics, Halley VI, and the Tin Shui Wai Hospital in Hong Kong.

NEC3 was endorsed by The Construction Clients' Board (formerly Public Sector Construction Clients' Forum), Crown Commercial Services, The Facilities Management Board of the Cabinet Office UK, The South African Construction Industry Development Board, The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), The Association for Project Management (APM) and The British Institute of Facilities Management (BIFM).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.neccontract.com/About-NEC/Endorsements&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hong Kong government decided to use NEC3 contracts generally for all government projects tendered in 2015/16. After a series of successful NEC3 projects in the region, the Hong Kong government announced in November 2016 that the NEC contract suite will be used for all future public works projects as far as practicable.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.neccontract.com/About-NEC/News-Media/Hong-Kong-government-endorses-NEC-as-main-contract&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison==

The following demonstrates the differing approaches to drafting in the NEC and ICE forms of contract using the illustration of circumstances when the contractor is entitled to additional time and cost for physical conditions.

;NEC Engineering and Construction Contract Second Edition Clause 60.1 (12)
The Contractor encounters physical conditions which
* are within the site.
* are not weather conditions and
* which an experienced contractor would have judged at the Contract Date to have such a small chance of occurring that it would have been unreasonable for her/him to have allowed for them.

;ICE Conditions of Contract Sixth Edition Clause 12(1)

&lt;blockquote&gt;If during the execution of the Works the Contractor shall encounter physical conditions (other than weather conditions or conditions due to weather conditions) or artificial obstructions which conditions or obstructions could not in her/his opinion reasonably have been foreseen by an experienced contractor the Contractor shall as early as practicable give written notice thereof to the Engineer. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Guidance Notes and Further Information==

Guidance Notes  and Flow Charts are published by the ICE. These notes are supplemented by the Frequently Asked Questions sections of the NEC website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neccontract.com/FAQs/index.asp  www.neccontract.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Prospective users of the NEC3 contract are encouraged to study the FAQ's in order to avoid unintended contract provisions. The often unintended Option C scenario where a Contractor is paid monies in excess of the Target Cost plus maximum share provisions is specifically not addressed in the guidance notes / Frequently Asked Questions. Other common misinterpretations are [http://www.neccontract.com/FAQs/faq_detail.asp?ID=117&amp;FAQCat=1&amp;FAQSubCat=&amp;Keyword= minutes of meetings as communications], [http://www.neccontract.com/FAQs/faq_detail.asp?ID=53&amp;FAQCat=1&amp;FAQSubCat=&amp;Keyword= deleted work] and [http://www.neccontract.com/FAQs/faq_detail.asp?ID=60&amp;FAQCat=1&amp;FAQSubCat=&amp;Keyword= paying for correcting defects]. Employers often use the additional conditions of contract (Z-clauses) to amend or delete contract provisions relating to these items.

The '''Northeast Ohio Master of Fine Arts Program''' ('''NEOMFA''') is a three-year graduate level consortial [[creative writing]] program located in [[Northeast Ohio]]. The NEOMFA has a unique collaborative design in which students attend all four universities in the consortium: [[Cleveland State University]], [[The University of Akron]], [[Kent State University]], and [[Youngstown State University]]. Poet [[Mary Biddinger]] is current director of the program.  Students are able to take classes at any of the four campuses, while being part of one unified writing program. The NEOFMA offers courses in poetry, fiction, creative non-fiction, playwriting, and literary translation. 

Since its inception in 2005, the NEOMFA has offered small-group workshops, open readings, summer travel fellowships, and high-profile visiting writers in addition to career-preparing internships and competitive graduate funding. Students have the opportunity to intern with literary presses at all four universities, in theater at the [[Cleveland Public Theater]], and in arts management through outreach programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8564">[[File:KCL.png|framed|Kirchhoff's current law is the basis of nodal analysis.]]
In electric circuits analysis, '''nodal analysis''', '''node-voltage analysis''', or the '''branch current method''' is a method of determining the voltage ([[potential difference]]) between "[[Node (circuits)|nodes]]" (points where elements or branches connect) in an [[electrical circuit]] in terms of the branch currents.

In analyzing a circuit using [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]], one can either do nodal analysis using Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) or [[mesh analysis]] using Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL). Nodal analysis writes an equation at each [[Node (circuits)|electrical node]], requiring that the branch currents incident at a node must sum to zero. The branch currents are written in terms of the circuit node voltages. As a consequence, each branch constitutive relation must give current as a function of voltage; an [[admittance]] representation. For instance, for a resistor, I&lt;sub&gt;branch&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;branch&lt;/sub&gt; * G, where G (=1/R) is the admittance (conductance) of the resistor.

Nodal analysis is possible when all the circuit elements' branch constitutive relations have an admittance representation. Nodal analysis produces a compact set of equations for the network, which can be solved by hand if small, or can be quickly solved using linear algebra by computer. Because of the compact system of equations, many [[circuit simulation]] programs (e.g. [[SPICE]]) use nodal analysis as a basis. When elements do not have admittance representations, a more general extension of nodal analysis, [[modified nodal analysis]], can be used.

== Method ==
# Note all connected wire segments in the circuit. These are the ''nodes'' of nodal analysis.
# Select one node as the ground reference. The choice does not affect the result and is just a matter of convention. Choosing the node with the most connections can simplify the analysis. For a circuit of  ''N'' nodes the number of nodal equations is ''N''−1.
# Assign a variable for each node whose voltage is unknown. If the voltage is already known, it is not necessary to assign a variable.
# For each unknown voltage, form an equation based on Kirchhoff's current law. Basically, add together all currents leaving from the node and mark the sum equal to zero. Finding the current between two nodes is nothing more than "the node with the higher potential, minus the node with the lower potential, divided by the resistance between the two nodes."
# If there are voltage sources between two unknown voltages, join the two nodes as a [[supernode (circuit)|supernode]]. The currents of the two nodes are combined in a single equation, and a new equation for the voltages is formed.
# Solve the system of [[simultaneous equations]] for each unknown voltage.

== Examples ==
=== Basic case&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ===
[[Image:Nodal_analysis.svg|thumb|right|280px|Basic example circuit with one unknown voltage, V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

The only unknown voltage in this circuit is V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. There are three connections to this node and consequently three currents to consider. The direction of the currents in calculations is chosen to be away from the node.
# Current through resistor R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: (V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;) / R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
# Current through resistor R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
# Current through current source I&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;: -I&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
With Kirchhoff's current law, we get:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_1 - V_S}{R_1} + \frac{V_1}{R_2} - I_S = 0&lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be solved with respect to V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;V_1 = \frac{\left( \frac{V_S}{R1} + I_S \right)}{\left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the unknown voltage can be solved by substituting numerical values for the symbols. Any unknown currents are easy to calculate after all the voltages in the circuit are known.

&lt;math&gt;V_1 = \frac{\left( \frac{5\text{ V}}{100\,\Omega} + 20\text{ mA} \right)}{\left( \frac{1}{100\,\Omega} + \frac{1}{200\,\Omega} \right)} = \frac{14}{3}\text{ V}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Supernodes ===
[[Image:Supernode_in_circuit_analysis.svg|thumb|right|182px|In this circuit, V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is between two unknown voltages, and is therefore a supernode.]] In this circuit, we initially have two unknown voltages, V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The voltage at V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is already known to be V&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; because the other terminal of the voltage source is at ground potential.

The current going through voltage source V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; cannot be directly calculated. Therefore, we cannot write the current equations for either V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. However, we know that the same current leaving node V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must enter node V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Even though the nodes cannot be individually solved, we know that the combined current of these two nodes is zero. This combining of the two nodes is called the [[supernode (circuit)|supernode]] technique, and it requires one additional equation: V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;.

The complete set of equations for this circuit is:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\frac{V_1 - V_\text{B}}{R_1} + \frac{V_2 - V_\text{B}}{R_2} + \frac{V_2}{R_3} = 0\\
V_1 = V_2 + V_\text{A}\\
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

By substituting V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to the first equation and solving in respect to V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, we get:

&lt;math&gt;
V_2 = \frac{(R_1 + R_2) R_3 V_\text{B} - R_2 R_3 V_\text{A}}{(R_1 + R_2) R_3 + R_1 R_2}
&lt;/math&gt;


== Matrix form for the node-voltage equation ==

In general, for a circuit with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; nodes, the node-voltage equations obtained by nodal analysis can be written in a matrix form as derived in the following.
For any node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, KCL states &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j\ne k}G_{jk}(v_k-v_j)=0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;G_{kj}=G_{jk}&lt;/math&gt; is the negative of the sum of the conductances between nodes &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;v_k&lt;/math&gt; is the voltage of node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
This implies &lt;math&gt;0=\sum_{j\ne k}G_{jk}(v_k-v_j)=\sum_{j\ne k}G_{jk}v_k-\sum_{j\ne k}G_{jk}v_j=G_{kk}v_k-\sum_{j\ne k}G_{jk}v_j&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;G_{kk}&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of conductances connected to node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. 
We note that the first term contributes linearly to the node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; via &lt;math&gt;G_{kk}&lt;/math&gt;, while the second term contributes linearly to each node &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; connected to the node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; via &lt;math&gt;G_{jk}&lt;/math&gt; with a minus sign.
If an independent current source/input &lt;math&gt;i_k&lt;/math&gt; is also attached to node &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the above expression is generalized to &lt;math&gt;i_k=G_{kk}v_k-\sum_{j\ne k}G_{jk}v_j&lt;/math&gt;.
It is readily to show that one can combine the above node-voltage equations for all &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; nodes, and write them down in the following matrix form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
G_{11} &amp;G_{12}  &amp;\cdots  &amp;G_{1N} \\ 
G_{21} &amp;G_{22}  &amp;\cdots  &amp;G_{2N} \\ 
\vdots &amp;\vdots  &amp;\ddots  &amp; \vdots\\ 
G_{N1} &amp;G_{N2}  &amp;\cdots  &amp;G_{NN} 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
v_1\\ 
v_2\\ 
\vdots\\ 
v_N
\end{pmatrix}=
\begin{pmatrix}
i_1\\ 
i_2\\ 
\vdots\\ 
i_N
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
or simply
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf {Gv} = \mathbf i&lt;/math&gt;
The matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf G&lt;/math&gt; on the left hand side of the equation is singular since it satisfies &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {G 1}=0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf 1&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;1\times N&lt;/math&gt; column matrix. This corresponds to the fact of current conservation, namely, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k}i_k=0&lt;/math&gt;, and the freedom to choose a reference node (ground). In practice, the voltage is the reference node is taken to be 0. Consider it is the last node, &lt;math&gt;v_N=0&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, it is straightforward to verify that the resulting equations for the other &lt;math&gt;N-1&lt;/math&gt; nodes remain the same, and therefore one can simply discard the last column as well as the last line of the matrix equation. This procedure results in a &lt;math&gt;(N-1)\times(N-1)&lt;/math&gt; dimensional non-singular matrix equation with the definitions of all the elements stay unchanged.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1774">'''The Orion Center for the Study of the Dead Sea Scrolls and Associated Literature''' was established in 1995 as part of the Institute for Jewish Studies at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Its overarching aim is to stimulate all aspects of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

Over the years it has hosted a series of symposia bringing together many of the world's experts on the scrolls to give papers on topics related to the specific theme of that year's symposium. Past symposia have examined such subjects as the Damascus Document, wisdom literature and the reworking of biblical literature. Many of these symposia have been published by the center.

Since 1999 the Orion Center has held regular seminars relating to the Dead Sea Scrolls in memory of Professor [[Jonas C. Greenfield]]. [[Emanuel Tov]] gave the inaugural seminar on "The Greek Texts from the Judaean Desert".

The study of '''pathogenomics''' attempts to utilize [[genomic]] and [[metagenomics]] data gathered from high through-put technologies (e.g. [[sequencing]] or [[DNA microarrays]]), to understand microbe diversity and interaction as well as host-microbe interactions involved in disease states.  The bulk of pathogenomics research concerns itself with pathogens that affect human health; however, studies also exist for plant and animal infecting microbes.

==History==
In the early investigation of microbial [[genomics]], it was difficult and costly to obtain sequence information for any pathogen. In 1995, the first pathogen genome, that of [[Haemophilus influenza]], was sequenced by traditional Sanger methods.  Sanger methods, however, were slow and costly.&lt;ref name="Fleischmann"&gt;{{Cite journal

With the sequences of many organisms available for analysis, scientists, through their investigations, began to challenge some of the earlier tenets of bacterial genome structure. Older paradigms of microbial genomics believed that only a few strains were sufficient to represent a specific bacterial species.&lt;ref name= "Pallen" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Liggett" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Raskin"&gt;

It was thought that bacterial genomes, like eukaryotes, were relatively stable.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It became evident that sequencing multiple strains for a species, rather than a few selectively chosen ones, was necessary to understand the diversity in a microbial species [[gene pool]]. It was also increasingly important to understand how to account for these differences in genomic content across a species strains and how it may contribute to pathogenic behaviour or prevent the  formation of pathogens.&lt;ref name="Liggett" /&gt;
{{news release|date=December 2011}}
More recently,{{When|date=November 2015}} the sequenced genomic data have been catalogued in databases and made publicly available online (there also exist non-publicly available databases in the [[private sector]]).  The availability and influx of this information presses upon those who conduct pathogenomics research to come up with a way of drawing meaningful conclusions from these data. In addition, the availability of such data on the Internet encourages global collaboration of labs.

==Microbe analysis==
[[Pathogens]] may be prokaryotic (archaea or bacteria), single-celled Eukarya or viruses. Prokaryotic genomes have typically been easier to sequence due to smaller genome size compared to Eukarya.&lt;ref name = "Liggett" /&gt; Due to this, there is a bias in reporting [[pathogenic bacteria]]l behaviour.  More recently{{When|date=November 2015}} there have been increased efforts to sequence Eukarya genomes and more will be underway in the future.&lt;ref name = "Liggett" /&gt; Regardless of this bias in reporting, many of the dynamic genomic events are similar across all the types of pathogen organisms.

Pathogenomics does not focus exclusively on understanding [[Host–pathogen interaction|pathogen-host interactions]]. Insight of individual or cooperative pathogen behaviour provides knowledge into the development or inheritance of pathogen virulence factors.&lt;ref name= "Pallen" /&gt; Through a deeper understanding of the small subunits that cause infection, it may be able possible to develop novel therapeutics that are efficient and cost effective.

===Analyzing individual microbes===
Dynamic [[genomes]]  with high plasticity are necessary to allow pathogens, especially bacteria, to survive in changing environments.&lt;ref name = "Liggett" /&gt;  With the assistance of high throughput sequencing methods and [[in silico]] technologies, it is possible to detect, compare and catalogue many of these dynamic genomic events. Particular interest is in understanding how genomic events lead to pathogen development and how these events may be interrupted to prevent it.

====Causes of genomic diversity====
Three forces act in shaping the pathogen genome: gene gain, gene loss, and genome rearrangement.&lt;ref name= "Pallen" /&gt; The knowledge and detection of these genomic dynamic events are necessary in the construction of useful therapeutic tools to combat pathogens.

=====Bacterial genome evolutionary dynamics=====

======Gene loss and genome decay======
Gene loss or genome decay occurs when a gene is no longer used by the microbe or when a microbe attempts to adapt to a new ecological niche.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-10-54| pmid = 19175920| title = Evidence for niche adaptation in the genome of the bovine pathogen Streptococcus uberis| journal = BMC Genomics| volume = 10| pages = 54| year = 2009| last1 = Ward | first1 = P.

It is possible to detect the presence of pseudogenes and the marks of genome decay through whole-genome sequencing in combination with [[comparative genomics]] &lt;ref name= "Pallen" /&gt; Comparative genomics has helped to reveal that pathogens may favour losing genes in order to live in a host-associated niche and become endosymbionts. Sometimes the shedding of certain genes also renders a pathogen microbe harmless. The analysis of [[Listeria]] strains, for example, has shown that a reduced genome size has led to the generation of a non-pathogenic [[Listeria]] strain from a pathogenic precursor.&lt;ref name="Hain"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have been shown to exhibit genome-wide rearrangements due to [[insertion sequences]]  and repetitive DNA segments.&lt;ref name = "Liggett" /&gt;  At this time, no studies demonstrate genome-wide rearrangement events directly giving rise to pathogenic behaviour in a microbe. This does not mean it is not possible.  Genome-wide rearrangements do, however, contribute to the plasticity of bacterial genome, which may prime the conditions for other factors to introduce, or lose, virulence factors.&lt;ref name = "Liggett" /&gt;

======Single-nucleotide polymorphism======
[[Single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) are also a genomic variable that adds to the diversity of pathogen strains. Current{{When|date=November 2015}} efforts attempt to catalogue the various SNPs in pathogen strains.&lt;ref name = "Europe" /&gt;

====Analysis of genomic diversity====
There is a need to analyze more than a single genome sequence of a pathogen species to understand pathogen mechanisms. [[Comparative genomics]] is a methodology that has gained more applicability with the recent{{When|date=November 2015}} increased amount of sequence information.  There are several examples of successful comparative genomics studies, among them the analysis of Listeria.&lt;ref name="Hain" /&gt;  and Escherichia coli.&lt;ref name="Perna" /&gt; The most important topic comparative genomics, in a pathogenomic context, attempts to address the difference between pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes.  This inquiry, though, proves to be very difficult to analyze, since a single bacterial species can have many strains and the genomic content of each of these strains can vary.&lt;ref name="Perna" /&gt;

Caution may need to be exercised when extending the definition of a pan-genome or a core-genome to the other pathogen organisms; this is because there is no formal evidence of the properties of these pan-genomes. Here, it will be assumed that the definitions may extend, since all pathogen organisms share in the same dynamic genomic events and rely upon variability within strains as a mechanism of survival and virulence.

A core genome is the set of genes found across all strains of a pathogen species.&lt;ref name= " Tettelin " /&gt; A pan-genome is the entire gene pool for that pathogen species, and includes genes that are not shared by all strains.&lt;ref name= " Tettelin " /&gt; Pan-genomes may be open or closed depending on whether  comparative analysis of multiple strains reveals no new genes (closed) or many new genes (open) compared to the core genome for that pathogen species.&lt;ref name= " Pallen " /&gt; In the open pan-genome, genes may be further characterized as dispensable or strain specific.

===Eco-evo perspective===
The "eco-evo" perspective on pathogen-host interactions emphasizes the influences ecology and the environment on pathogen evolution.&lt;ref name= "Pallen " /&gt; The dynamic genomic factors such as gene loss, gene gain and genome rearrangement are all strongly influenced by changes in the ecological niche that a particular microbial strain resides in. Microbes may switch from being pathogenic and non-pathogenic due to changing environments.&lt;ref name= " Hain" /&gt; Studies of the plague, [[Yersinia pestis]], are prominent demonstration of how over time a microbe, in this case Yersinia pestis, evolves from a gastrointestinal pathogen to a very highly pathogenic microbe through dynamic genomic events.&lt;ref name= " Achtman"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These flips between being pathogenic and non-pathogenic status and how they occurred with respect to ecological or environmental changes are important in novel therapeutic development to combat microbial infections.&lt;ref name= "Pallen " /&gt;

==Applications==
Many of the future challenges of pathogenomics begin with handling and making sense of the large influx of data that now is available to the research community. Mining the data for useful information proves to be applicable to many facets of [[epidemiology]]. [[bioinformatics]] approaches are providing much of the power for rapidly mining, organising, analyzing, visualizing and annotating the data catalogued in databases.

Note that pathogenomics research could shed light for  extensions of pathogens, or non-pathogens, that are not related to human, plant or animal health; using microbes for bioremediation is one example. There is some but very little dialogue, however, concerning these extensions to pathogens and their relation to pathogenomics. It would be more suitable{{When|date=November 2015}} to categorize [[pathogen]]/non-pathogen applications that are unrelated to infection under the more general category of microbe genomics. Some general reviews speak extensively both about pathogen related and non-related applications in the same article.&lt;ref name= "Liggett " /&gt;

In the advent of new technology, it is easy{{When|date=November 2015}} to forget some of the basic things that prevent pathogen infections from starting and spreading. While there exist more deadly and difficult-to-handle pathogen infections, there also exist less dangerous ones. Historically, human health greatly improved with more emphasis on healthy life styles including better [[hygiene]] practices and access to clean recourses of water and nutrition.

===Reverse vaccinology===
The variability of genomes can make the developed of a vaccine very difficult, and [[antigen]] variation cannot match pathogen variation. [[Reverse vaccinology]] is a novel approach that may develop vaccines to combat pathogens  more effectively.&lt;ref name= "Serruto"&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''Philippine Genome Center (PGC)''' is a multi-disciplinary research facility in [[Quezon City]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]] which specializes in [[genomics]].
==History==
The Philippine Genome Center was first conceptualized in 2009 in response to the [[SARS outbreak]] which affected Hong Kong, the [[dengue]] outbreaks which affecting the Philippines, and the then-ongoing [[2009 flu pandemic|H1N1 flu pandemic]] which originated in Mexico. The first grants received by the PGC were for dengue diagnostic testing and [[H1n1|H1N1]] surveillance.&lt;ref name="ei"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Estospace|first1=Eden|title=Philippine Genome Center: Big step in health and agri research|url=https://www.enterpriseinnovation.net/article/philippine-genome-center-big-step-health-and-agri-research-1630239239|accessdate=21 April 2018|work=Enterprise Innovation|date=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the facility was placed under the jurisdiction of the [[University of the Philippines Diliman|University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman]]'s Office of the President as per the approval of the UP Board of Regents in its July 31, 2009 meeting.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=https://pgc.up.edu.ph/index.php/about/|publisher=Philippine Genome Center|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UP Board of Regents approved the transfer of management and supervision of the PGC from the university's Office of the President to the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs in February 26, 2016.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

==Facilities==
The PGC has two "core facilities"; the Core Facility for Bioniformatics (CFB) and the DNA Sequencing Core Facility. A [[biobank]] is planned as PGC's third facility.&lt;ref name="gmadna"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luces|first1=Kim|title=PHL Genome Center opens new DNA sequencing facility to local researchers|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/scitech/science/328088/phl-genome-center-opens-new-dna-sequencing-facility-to-local-researchers/story/|accessdate=21 April 2018|work=GMA News|date=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two facilities were funded by a {{Philippine peso|100 million}} (US$2.2 million) grant over three years from the Philippine Council for Industry, Energy and Emerging Technology Research and Development (PCIEERD) of the [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|Department of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref name="ei"/&gt;

===DNA Sequencing Core Facility===
Opened in September 24, 2013 The DNA Sequencing Core Facility (DSCF) was the first core facility to open. Genomic studies in the field of agriculture, biodiversity, forensics, health, and ethnicity are conducted in the DSCF with the intent to specifically cater to Filipino needs.&lt;ref name="gmadna"/&gt; [[DNA sequencing|DNA]] and [[Genome sequencing]] services are provided at the DSCF.&lt;ref name="ei"/&gt;

===Core Facility for Bioniformatics===
The Core Facility for Bioinformatics (CFB) is a facility that provides genome-scale data generation and analysis to local researchers in the academe, from government institutions and private organizations. It also provides genomic data storage. It is also augmented by a [[IBM]] [[Blue Gene]] supercomputer which is also used by the [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]] (PAGASA) and [[Project Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards]] (Project NOAH) for weather forecast and climate change modelling purposes in addition to genomic research use. The CFB was launched in April 14, 2014 while the supercomputer was made operational within the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ronda|first1=Rainier Allan|title=DOST activates IBM supercomputer|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/04/14/14/dost-activates-ibm-supercomputer|accessdate=21 April 2018|work=ABS-CBN News|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plant identification''' is the process of matching a specimen plant to a known [[taxon]].  It uses various methods, most commonly [[dichotomous key]]s or [[multi-access key]]s.

==History==
{{see also|History of botany|History of plant systematics}}   
[[File:GeorgeBentham.jpg|thumb|upright|[[George Bentham]] English systematician and botanist]]
Plant identification has evolved over hundreds of years and depends to a large extent on what criteria and whose system is used. Plant identification implies comparisons of certain characteristics and then assigning a particular plant to a known taxonomic group, ultimately arriving at a species or [[infraspecific name]].

In the history of botany many large systems, useful at the time, were widely used for decades until superseded as taxonomic knowledge progressed.
*''Genera Plantarum''&lt;ref&gt;Isely, Duane. 1994 ''One hundred and one botanists'' Iowa State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was devised by [[George Bentham]] (1800–1884) and [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] (1817–1911) who were British botanists working for [[Kew Gardens|Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] in the latter part of the nineteenth century. They described the system in a three-volume work. A total of 202 groups were described, which they called "orders" - now known as families. The system was renowned for being very practical and the keys were quite accurate.

The study by of plant taxonomy with [[computer programme]]s was beginning by the early 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/1218086 |title=Computer-Assisted Storage and Retrieval of the Data of Taxonomy and Systematics |author=Larry E. Morse |journal=Taxon |volume=23 |issue=1 |year=1974 |pages=29–43 |doi=10.2307/1218086}}&lt;/ref&gt; and botanical keys now use numerical computer systems.  &lt;!--The plant identification key was deleted on request--&gt;

==Taxonomy==
This is the branch of botany which deals with plant identification, nomenclature and classification. The term, first coined by French botanist A. P. de Candolle (1813). [[Carl Linnaeus]] used the term 'Systematics' which now includes identification, nomenclature and evolutionary relationships.

==Herbarium==
{{Main|Herbarium}}
Reference collections of plant specimens are collected into herbarium and identified. Most plant parts are dried, pressed, mounted on herbarium sheets and stored; succulents and some other types of plants are normally kept in alcohol solution. The sheets are standard size of 16{{fraction|1|2}}  × 11{{fraction|1|2}} inches or 41.25 × 28.75&amp;nbsp;cm. The identified plant ideally includes all parts including roots, flowers and fruits, strobili, etc. One of the largest herbaria in the world is kept at the [[Kew Gardens|Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] England and has collected an estimated 7 Million specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://sweetgum.nybg.org/ih/herbarium.php?irn=125812 |title=Index Herbariorum |entry=entry for RBG Kew |accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Privacy by design''' is an approach to [[systems engineering]] initially developed by [[Ann Cavoukian]] and formalized in a joint report on [[privacy-enhancing technologies]] by a joint team of the [[Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario]] (Canada), the [[Dutch Data Protection Authority]] and the [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hes|first=R|title=Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity|url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/library/repository/mon/10000/184530.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deliveringthepromises"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hustinx|first=Peter|title=Privacy by Design: Delivering the Promises|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12394-010-0061-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; The privacy by design framework was published in 2009&lt;ref name=7principles/&gt; and adopted by the International Assembly of Privacy Commissioners and Data Protection Authorities in 2010.&lt;ref name=resolution/&gt; Privacy by design calls for [[privacy]] to be taken into account throughout the whole engineering process. The concept is an example of [[value sensitive design]], i.e., to take human values into account in a well-defined manner throughout the whole process and may have been derived from this.

Cavoukian's approach to privacy has been criticized as being vague&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, difficult to enforce its adoption&lt;ref name=Counterfactual&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, difficult to apply to certain disciplines&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as prioritizing corporate interests over consumers' interests&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"/&gt; and placing insufficient emphasis on minimizing data collection&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"/&gt;.

The European [[GDPR]] regulation incorporates privacy by design.&lt;ref name=Opinion/&gt;

==History and background==
The privacy by design framework was developed by Dr. [[Ann Cavoukian]], [[Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario]], following her joint work with the [[Dutch Data Protection Authority]] and the [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Opinion/&gt;
In 2009, the [[Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario]] co-hosted an event, ''Privacy by Design: The Definitive Workshop'', with the Israeli Law, Information and Technology Authority at the 31st International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioner (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy Conference 2009 Fifth Plenary Session – Privacy by Design|url=http://www.privacyconference2009.org/program/Programa_detallado/index-iden-idweb.html#sesion5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=report2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on the State of PbD to the 33rd International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners|url=https://ipc.v51.com/wp-content/uploads/Resources/PbDReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the framework achieved international acceptance when the International Assembly of Privacy Commissioners and Data Protection Authorities unanimously passed a resolution on privacy by design&lt;ref name=foreword&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy by Design: the definitive workshop. A foreword by Ann Cavoukian, Ph.D|url=https://rd.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs12394-010-0062-y.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognising it as an international standard at their annual conference.&lt;ref name=report2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Privacy by Design’ approach gains international recognition |url=https://www.itbusiness.ca/news/video-rewind-privacy-by-design-approach-gains-international-recognition/15626}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Landmark Resolution passed to preserve the Future of Privacy|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108031015/http://www.ipc.on.ca/english/Resources/News-Releases/News-Releases-Summary/?id=992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=resolution&gt;{{cite web|title=32nd International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners Jerusalem, Israel 27-29 October, 2010 Resolution on Privacy by Design|url=https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/10-10-27_jerusalem_resolutionon_privacybydesign_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other commitments, the commissioners resolved to promote privacy by design as widely as possible and foster the incorporation of the principle into policy and legislation.&lt;ref name=resolution/&gt;

== Foundational principles ==
Privacy by design is based on seven "foundational principles":&lt;ref name=7principles&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/Resources/7foundationalprinciples.pdf|title=7 Foundational Principles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

The principles have been cited in over five hundred articles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10949576998236199397|title=Citations for ''Privacy by Design in Law, Policy and Practice''|publisher=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the ''Privacy by Design in Law, Policy and Practice'' white paper by [[Ann Cavoukian]].&lt;ref name=pbdLawPolicyPracitice&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/library/repository/mon/25008/312239.pdf|title="Privacy by Design in Law, Policy and Practice – A White Paper for Regulators, Decision-makers and Policy-makers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foundational principles in detail ===
====Proactive not reactive; preventative not remedial==== 
The privacy by design approach is characterized by proactive rather than reactive measures. It anticipates and prevents privacy invasive events before they happen. Privacy by design does not wait for privacy risks to materialize, nor does it offer remedies for resolving privacy infractions once they have occurred — it aims to prevent them from occurring. In short, privacy by design comes before-the-fact, not after.
&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/Resources/pbd-implement-7found-principles.pdf|title=The 7 Foundational Principles Implementation and Mapping of Fair Information Practices|date=January 2011|publisher=Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=https://ipc.v51.com/wp-content/uploads/Resources/pbd-primer.pdf|title=Privacy by Design – Primer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=https://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/pbdce/seven-foundational-principles/The-7-Foundational-Principles.pdf|title=Privacy by Design – The 7 Foundational Principles|publisher=Privacy and Big Data Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Privacy as the default====
Privacy by design seeks to deliver the maximum degree of privacy by ensuring that personal data are automatically protected in any given IT system or business practice. If an individual does nothing, their privacy still remains intact. No action is required on the part of the individual to protect their privacy — it is built into the system, by default.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====Privacy embedded into design====
Privacy by design is embedded into the design and architecture of IT systems as well as business practices. It is not bolted on as an add-on, after the fact. The result is that privacy becomes an essential component of the core functionality being delivered. Privacy is integral to the system without diminishing functionality.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====Full functionality – positive-sum, not zero-sum====
Privacy by design seeks to accommodate all legitimate interests and objectives in a positive-sum “win-win” manner, not through a dated, zero-sum approach, where unnecessary trade-offs are made. Privacy by design avoids the pretense of false dichotomies, such as privacy versus security, demonstrating that it is possible to have both.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====End-to-end security – full lifecycle protection====
Privacy by design, having been embedded into the system prior to the first element of information being collected, extends securely throughout the entire lifecycle of the data involved — strong security measures are essential to privacy, from start to finish. This ensures that all data are securely retained, and then securely destroyed at the end of the process, in a timely fashion. Thus, privacy by design ensures cradle-to-grave, secure lifecycle management of information, end-to-end.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====Visibility and transparency – keep it open====
Privacy by design seeks to assure all stakeholders that whatever the business practice or technology involved, it is in fact, operating according to the stated promises and objectives, subject to independent verification. Its component parts and operations remain visible and transparent, to users and providers alike. Remember, trust but verify.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====Respect for user privacy – keep it user-centric====
Above all, privacy by design requires architects and operators to keep the interests of the individual uppermost by offering such measures as strong privacy defaults, appropriate notice, and empowering user-friendly options. Keep it user-centric.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

==Design and standards==
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) approved the Committee on Consumer Policy (COPOLCO) proposal for a new ISO standard: ''Consumer Protection: Privacy by Design for Consumer Goods and Services'' (ISO/PC317).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO/PC 317 - Consumer protection: privacy by design for consumer goods and services|url=https://www.iso.org/committee/6935430.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard will aim to specify the design process to provide consumer goods and services that meet consumers’ domestic processing privacy needs as well as the personal privacy requirements of data protection. The standard has the UK as secretariat with thirteen participating members&lt;ref name=ISOPC317Members&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO/PC 317 - Participating Members|url=https://www.iso.org/committee/6935430.html?view=participation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and twenty observing members.&lt;ref name=ISOPC317Members/&gt;

The Standards Council of Canada (SCC) is one of the participating members, and has established a mirror Canadian committee to ISO/PC317.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCC ISO/PC 317 - Consumer protection: privacy by design for consumer goods and services|url=https://www.scc.ca/en/standards/committees/iso-pc-317-consumer-protection-privacy-design-for-consumer-goods-and-services}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The OASIS Privacy by Design Documentation for Software Engineers (PbD-SE)&lt;ref name=OASIS&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS Privacy by Design Documentation for Software Engineers (PbD-SE) TC|url=https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=pbd-ses}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technical Committee provides a specification to operationalize privacy by design in the context of software engineering. Privacy by design, like security by design, is a normal part of the software development process and a risk reduction strategy for software engineers. The PbD-SE specification translates the PbD principles to conformance requirements within software engineering tasks, and helps software development teams to produce [[artifact (software development)|artifact]]s as evidence of PbD principle adherence. Following the specification facilitates the documentation of privacy requirements from software conception to retirement, thereby providing a plan around adherence to privacy by design principles, and other guidance to privacy best practices, such as NIST’s 800-53 Appendix J (NIST SP 800-53) and the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs) (PMRM-1.0).&lt;ref name=OASIS/&gt;

==Relationship to privacy-enhancing technologies == 
Privacy by design originated from [[privacy-enhancing technologies]] (PETs) in a joint 1995 report by Ann Cavoukian and John Borking.&lt;ref name="Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity"/&gt; In 2007 the [[European Commission]] provided a memo on PETs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs)|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-07-159_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the British Information Commissioner's Office commissioned a report titled ''Privacy by Design – An Overview of Privacy Enhancing Technologies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy by Design – An Overview of Privacy Enhancing Technologies|url=http://www.dsp.utoronto.ca/projects/surveillance/docs/pbd_pets_paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many facets to privacy by design, including software and systems engineering as well as administrative elements (e.g. legal, policy, procedural), other organizational controls and operating contexts. Privacy by design evolved from early efforts to express fair information practice principles directly into the design and operation of information and communications technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|title=Privacy by Design : Origins, Meaning, and Prospects for Assuring Privacy and Trust in the Information Era)|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289769458_Privacy_by_Design_Origins_meaning_and_prospects_for_assuring_privacy_and_trust_in_the_information_era}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his publication ''Privacy by Design: Delivering the Promises''&lt;ref name="deliveringthepromises"/&gt; [[Peter Hustinx]] acknowledges the key role played by [[Ann Cavoukian]] and [[John Borking]], then Deputy Privacy Commissioners, in the joint 1995 publication ''Privacy-Enhancing Technologies: The Path to Anonymity''.&lt;ref name="Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity"/&gt; This 1995 report focussed on exploring technologies that permit transactions to be conducted anonymously.

Privacy-enhancing technologies allow online users to protect the privacy of their personally identifiable information (PII) provided to (and handled by) services or applications. Privacy by design evolved to consider the broader systems and processes in which PETs were embedded and operated. The U.S. Center for Democracy &amp; Technology (CDT) in ''The Role of Privacy by Design in Protecting Consumer Privacy''&lt;ref name=RoleProtectingConsumers&gt;{{cite web|title=The Role of Privacy by Design in Protecting Consumer Privacy|url=https://cdt.org/insight/the-role-of-privacy-by-design-in-protecting-consumer-privacy-1/}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes PET from privacy by design noting that “PETs are most useful for users who already understand online privacy risks. They are essential user empowerment tools, but they form only a single piece of a broader framework that should be considered when discussing how technology can be used in the service of protecting privacy.”&lt;ref name=RoleProtectingConsumers/&gt;

== Criticism and recommendations==
The privacy by design framework attracted academic debate, particularly following the 2010 International Data Commissioners resolution, these provide criticism of privacy by design with suggestions by legal and engineering experts to better understand how to apply the framework into various contexts.&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Counterfactual/&gt;

Privacy by design has been critiqued as "vague"&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"&gt;{{cite web|last=van Rest|first=Jeroen|title=Designing Privacy by Design|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-54069-1_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and leaving "many open questions about their application when engineering systems".&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineering Privacy by Design|url=http://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/publications/article-1542.pdf|work=Seda Gurses, Carmela Troncoso, and Claudia Diaz}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2007, researchers at K.U. Leuven published ''Engineering Privacy by Design'' noting that “The design and implementation of privacy requirements in systems is a difficult problem and requires translation of complex social, legal and ethical concerns into systems requirements”. The authors claim that their statement regarding that the principles of privacy by design "remain vague and leave many open questions about their application when engineering systems", may be viewed as criticism. However, the purpose of the paper is to propose that "starting from data minimization is a necessary and foundational first step to engineer systems in line with the principles of privacy by design". The objective of their paper is to provide an "initial inquiry into the practice of privacy by design from an engineering perspective in order to contribute to the closing of the gap between policy makers’ and engineers’ understanding of privacy by design".&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"/&gt; 

It has also been pointed out that privacy by design is similar to [[voluntary compliance]] schemes in industries impacting the environment, and thus lacks the teeth necessary to be effective, and may differ per company. In addition, the evolutionary approach currently taken to the development of the concept will come at the cost of privacy infringements because evolution implies also letting unfit phenotypes (privacy-invading products) live until they are proven unfit.&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"/&gt; Some critics have pointed out that certain business models are built around customer surveillance and data manipulation and therefore voluntary compliance is unlikely.&lt;ref name=Counterfactual&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy by Design: A Counterfactual Analysis of Google and Facebook Privacy Incidents|ssrn=2128146|work=Ira Rubinstein and Nathan Good}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Danish National It and Telecom Agency published as discussion paper on "New Digital Security Models" the publication references "Privacy by Design" as a key goal in creating a security model that is compliant with "Privacy by Design". This is done by extending the concept to "Security by Design" with an objective of balancing anonymity and surveillance by eliminating identification as much as possible.&lt;ref name="New Digital Security Models"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Digital Security Models|url=https://www.digitaliser.dk/resource/896495/artefact/NewDigitalSecurityModels.pdf?artefact=true&amp;PID=1792137|work=Danish National It and Telecom Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2013, Rubenstein and Good used [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] privacy incidents to conduct a counterfactual analysis in order to identify lessons learned of value for regulators when recommending privacy by design. The first was that “more detailed principles and specific examples” would be more helpful to companies. The second is that “usability is just as important as engineering principles and practices”. The third is that there needs to be more work on “refining and elaborating on design principles–both in privacy engineering and usability design”. including efforts to define international privacy standards. The final lesson learned is that “regulators must do more than merely recommend the adoption and implementation of privacy by design”.&lt;ref name=Counterfactual/&gt;

Another criticism is that current definitions of privacy by design do not address the methodological aspect of systems engineering, such as using decent system engineering methods, e.g. those which cover the complete system and data life cycle. The concept also does not focus on the role of the actual data holder but on that of the system designer. This role is not known in privacy law, so the concept of privacy by design is not based in law. This, in turn, undermines the trust by data subjects, data holders and policy-makers.&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"/&gt;

The advent of [[GDPR]] with its maximum fine of 4% of global turnover now provides a balance between business benefit and turnover, and addresses the [[voluntary compliance]] criticism and requirement from Rubenstein and Good that “regulators must do more than merely recommend the adoption and implementation of privacy by design”.&lt;ref name=Counterfactual/&gt; Rubenstein and Good also highlighted that privacy by design could result in applications that exemplified Privacy by Design and their work was well received.&lt;ref name=CorporateHotness&gt;{{cite web|title=Why 'Privacy By Design' Is The New Corporate Hotness|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2011/07/28/why-privacy-by-design-is-the-new-corporate-hotness|work=Kashmir Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Counterfactual/&gt;

The May 2018 [[European Data Protection Supervisor]] [[Giovanni Buttarelli]]'s paper ''Preliminary Opinion on Privacy by Design'' states, "While privacy by design has made significant progress in legal, technological and conceptual development, it is still far from unfolding its full potential for the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals. The following sections of this opinion provide an overview of relevant developments and recommend further efforts".&lt;ref name=Opinion&gt;{{cite web|title=Preliminary Opinion on privacy by design|url=https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/18-05-31_preliminary_opinion_on_privacy_by_design_en_0.pdf|work=Giovanni Buttarelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The executive summary makes the following recommendations to EU institutions:
* To ensure strong privacy protection, including privacy by design, in the ePrivacy Regulation.

==Implementing privacy by design==
The [[European Data Protection Supervisor]] [[Giovanni Buttarelli]] set out the requirement to implement privacy by design in his article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy by Design - Privacy Engineering|url=https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/18-01-25_privacy_by_design_privacy_engineering_cpdp_en_3.pdf|work=Giovanni Buttarelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union Agency for Network and Information Security]] (ENISA) provided a detailed report ''Privacy and Data Protection by Design – From Policy to Engineering'' on implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy and Data Protection by Design – from policy to engineering|url=https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design/at_download/fullReport|work=ENISA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Summer School on real-world crypto and privacy provided a tutorial on "Engineering Privacy by Design".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineering privacy by design|url=https://summerschool-croatia.cs.ru.nl/2017/slides/Engineering%20privacy%20by%20design.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_10_Privacy_Risks_Project OWASP Top 10 Privacy Risks Project] for web applications that gives hints on how to implement privacy by design in practice.

'''Projekt Sex (P6)''' is an independent organization working for the students of [[Lund University]] to promote [[sexual health]] on a physical, emotional and social level. It was founded in 1991 in [[Lund]] in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="Svenson et al 1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Svenson|first1=Gary|last2=Johnson|first2=Kent|last3=Hanson|first3=Bertil S.|editor1-last=Catalán|editor1-first=Jose|editor2-last=Hedge|editor2-first=Barbara|editor3-last=Sherr|editor3-first=Lorraine|title=The impact of AIDS: psychological and social aspects of HIV infection|date=1996|publisher=Harwood Academic|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9789057020407|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZsRZJHtMFoC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=falseC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=|chapter=Utilising Peer Education and Target Group Empowerment to Induce Behaviour Change on a University Campus Projekt 6 at Lund University Sweden}}&lt;/ref&gt; and belongs to the umbrella organization of the student life in Lund, [[Studentlund]], and the national umbrella organization [[Students for Sexual Health]] (SfSH). The method which is used by P6 is called [[Peer Education]], which means that students educate other students.

== Activities ==

To promote [[sexual health]] on a physical, emotional and social level among students of [[Lund University]], all students are welcome to pick up free condoms, lube and more information, for example about sexuality or where to get tested, from its office on the 4th floor of the AF Building in Lund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projekt6.se Projekt Sex]&lt;/ref&gt; 
To reach students outside of the P6 office, Projekt Sex organizes many different events: Most well-known are the condom raids happening during student parties and in nation clubs, where condoms are handed out and [[peer education]] takes place.&lt;ref name="Svenson et al 1996"/&gt; Every second Thursday, P6 has its own radio show airing on [[Radio AF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projekt6.se/en/radio/|title=Radio P6|website=projekt6.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioaf.se/program/p6/|title=P6 - Radio AF|website=www.radioaf.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the organization includes an active LGBTQ-group which hosts movie nights, discussion evenings and monthly brunches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projekt6.se/en/hbtq-studenterna/|title=LGBTQ group - Projekt6|website=projekt6.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every fourth year, Projekt Sex is also active in the student carnival Lundakarnevalen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=3940&amp;artikel=5874082|title=Hanna tävlar i sex på Lundakarnevalen - Ligga med P3|first=Sveriges|last=Radio|website=sverigesradio.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; The membership in P6 is free of charge, but students need to be members of the student umbrella organization [[Studentlund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentlund.se/p6/ P6 in Studentlund] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110150219/http://studentlund.se/p6/ |date=2014-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
P6 is also present at Campus Helsingborg, an additional campus of Lund University.

== History ==

Projekt Sex (P6) started as a [[peer education]] project under the Studenthealth and Skin Clinic in 1991. The project was launched after survey results had shown that years of frightening propaganda only had a short-term effect on the improvement of student's sexual health and that the numbers of [[sexually transmitted diseases]] among students was reaching extreme levels. The project P6 turned out to be successful; on three different occasions during the 1990s, large studies were conducted which all showed a consistent positive effect. 
The project received a lot of attention internationally and several projects with P6 as a role model have been launched around the world until today, for example in India, China and Uganda. 
Around 2003, several similar projects were launched in Sweden and today there are more than 10 Swedish student organizations working with sexual health among students. In the fall of 2009, these organizations, with support from the already established organization P6, formed the national umbrella organization [[Students for Sexual Health]] (SfSH).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsh.se/en/om-sfsh/sfshs-historia/|title=SfSH History|website=sfsh.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, P6 in Lund has around 700 members, of which 40-50 are active members, and keeps growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projekt6.se/en/om/p6-historia/|title=P6 History - Projekt6|website=projekt6.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dreams]] have been interpreted in many different ways from being a source of power to the capability of understanding and communicating with the dead.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|last1=McNamara|first1=P.|title=Religiosity and dream recall|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dream-catcher/201310/religiosity-and-dream-recall|publisher=Psychology Today: Health, Help, Happiness + Find a Therapist}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|last1=McNamara|first1=P.|title=Religion and dreams|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dream-catcher/201110/religion-and-dreams|publisher=Psychology Today: Health, Help, Happiness + Find a Therapist}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunter|first1=R.|title=A viewpoint|journal=American Journal of Psychotherapy|volume=37|pages=411–427}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional forms of societies considered dreams as portals to another world, a spirit world.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  These societies would even say they could gain most of their religious ideas from dreams.  They could identify the sacred and gain access to sacred realms or portals to the supernatural.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;  Psychologists have been researching dreams as of the 21st century because the connection between religious connotations in dreams has brought about growth and health.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  However, many different psychologists claim there is very little evidence to the research on the [[psychology of religion]] and dreams.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

==Dream interpretation==

The contemporary 21st century has brought about a scientific [[materialism]] that can be detrimental to understanding the concept of dreams and how to interpret them.  Traditionally, the concept of dreaming and interpreting dreams through religious means is universal.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  Some of the cultures around the world consider [[dream interpretation]] through their religious views as a means of spiritual discipline.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}  A psychological view of this connection between religious views and dream interpretation stems from analyzing the content of dreams.  The [[continuity theory]] has proposed that dream and waking cognition have everything in common except that dream cognition does not have the capability of being reflective.  The counter argument to this theory would purpose that dream and waking cognition are completely different.  Researchers such as [[Carl Jung]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] have claimed that dream processing must include a more symbolic approach, utilizing metaphors to explain its purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNamara|first1=P.|last2=Andresen|first2=J.|last3=Arrowhead|first3=J.|last4=Messer|first4=G.|title=Counterfactual cognitive operations in dreams|journal=Dreaming|pages=121–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of dream interpretation===

Many different researchers have tried to understand the purpose behind dreaming and state their most apprehensive work behind understanding early childhood dreams.  [[Sigmund Freud]] (1900/1965) claimed that dreams from childhood were illustrations of wish-fulfillment dreams that begin in naivety during childhood and escalate into later adulthood.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}  [[Carl Jung]] (1974) believed that childhood dreams were a sign of transpersonal wisdom from the unconscious.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}  [[G. William Domhoff]] (1996) and [[S. H. Foulkes]] (1999) were both known for arguing childhood dreams as a reflection of the immature development involved in the consciousness of a young child, involving characteristics such as being passive and bland.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}  [[Antti Revonsuo]] (2000) was in support of childhood dreams, in particular nightmares, to better support his idea of "threat simulation theory" found in dreaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stiller|first1=J.|last2=Sanchez|first2=A.|last3=Broughton|first3=B.|last4=Bulkeley|first4=K.|title=Earliest remembered dreams|journal=Dreaming|pages=205–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worldviews==

From the earliest of ones, dreams have been best interpreted as part of a religious worldview.  Traditional societies wouldn't have had a problem declaring dreams to be more than just a psychological state, but of an encounter with a different realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gollnick|first1=J.|title=Dream interpretation in the psychology of religion: A topic review|url=http://sir.sagepub.com/content/28/3/293.abstract|publisher=Dream interpretation in the psychology of religion: A topic review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the world's religious traditions in the 21st century have considered dreams to be sacred and part of a religious landscape.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}  Each culture has a different way of expressing their traditions and contemporary beliefs on dream and interpretation.  It is important to explore these different worldviews to gain a better sense of the relation between religion and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaplinsky|first1=C.|title=Shifting shadows: Shaping dynamics in the cultural unconscious|journal=Journal of Analytical Psychology|pages=189–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tribal/indigenous worldview===

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]' belief of dreaming is more similar to [[Buddhism]] versus that of common Western beliefs.  Their view of dreams and dream interpretation looks similar to that of an interactive conversation. The conversation happens between them and the world.  They are able to have this conversation because they don't see a difference between dreaming and waking reality, but rather an overlapping experience.  In this particular event in which they are overlapping worlds, they are able to open up their spiritual eyes to the visible and invisible, the audible and inaudible. The main goal of dreaming within this worldviews is twofold.  They first look to gain a strong connection between them and the world as well as enhance their self-knowledge and respect among their tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tedlock|first1=B.|title=The poetics And spirituality Of dreaming: A Native American enactive theory|journal=Dreaming|pages=183–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western worldview===

====Christianity====

The belief of dreams tying with religious themes in the Western worldview was not something that was naturally intuitive.  By having belief in these things, the [[Western culture]] would open their minds to a non-rational and imaginative force that opens up people's mind to understanding realism with evil and how one can have hope over it.  Pursuing dreams does not require God or gods and is why the Western culture receives this practice openly among their religious views and lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=R. L.|title=Review of the wilderness of dreams: Exploring the religious meanings of dreams in modern Western culture|journal=Dreaming|pages=289–291}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There has been debate among researchers as to whether researching dreams is worthwhile.  Some have debated that dreams are purposeless and completely random, whereas other have suggested dreams having an adaptive function that allows for positive implications.  Although there isn't findings of specifically lowering negative effects, research has alluded to dreams embellished with religious themes having a positive benefit for the user.  The biggest finding was related to dreams and religion included exploring this connection as a form of coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pargament|first1=K. I.|last2=Phillips|first2=R. E.|title=The sanctification of dreams: Prevalence and implications|journal=Dreaming|pages=141–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This effect of the Western worldview of dreams and dream interpretation with religious connotations has spread as far as the churches in [[Nigeria]], [[Africa]].  These churches believed their leaders in the church would receive frequent dreams that would guide them and their followers to a special spiritual status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Renne|first1=E. P.|title=Dressing in the stuff of dreams: Sacred dress and religious authority in Southwestern Nigeria|journal=Dreaming|pages=120–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern worldview===

====Buddhism====

Amidst different [[Hindu]]ism and Buddhist contexts, there are different theories such as sleepless dreaming that appear.  This is unique to the [[Eastern culture]] because it is rarely mentioned with the Western culture when discussing the possibility of dreams and religion. The only time Western writers talk of dreamless sleep is when referencing Hindu or Buddhist contexts.  This Eastern viewpoint gives a unique insight on how practices in Buddhist circles can be contextualized.   This dreamless sleep as mentioned prior is part of [[Tibetan Buddhist|Tibetan Buddhism]] practice of achieving a particular mental state before going into sleep.  They describe this experience as such of having visions and they require some visual criteria to be present for dreamless sleep to be achieved.  Its highest form of praise is that it gives practical guidelines for the practicing Buddhist and their progress in [[meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillespie|first1=G.|title=Dreams and dreamless sleep|journal=Dreaming|pages=199–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====

The [[Muslim]] society believes different forms of dreaming can help people come into contact with past martyrs of their [[faith]].  Their purpose is to give the dreamer full understanding of the martyr's existence and implications towards the future. Different examples of how dreams can affect the future of Muslims include but are not limited to: showing a prosperous future, motivate them into moral or spiritual development and warning them of impending dangers.  Decisions made by Muslims can be as important as deciding a future spouse can be determined through one particular dream.   The ultimate purpose behind these dreams is to give the devout Muslim a deeper insight into the truth that is not available in waking reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sirriyeh|first1=E.|title=Dream narratives of Muslims' martyrdom: Constant and changing roles past and present|journal=Dreaming|pages=168–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:JohnPurdue.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Purdue]], the University's eponymous benefactor]]

In 1865, the [[Indiana General Assembly]] voted to take advantage of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act of 1862]], and began plans to establish an institution with a focus on agriculture and engineering. Communities throughout the state offered their facilities and money to bid for the location of the new college. Popular proposals included the addition of an agriculture department at [[Indiana State University]] or at what is now [[Butler University]]. By 1869, [[Tippecanoe County]]’s offer included $150,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.15|1869|r=1}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) from Lafayette business leader and philanthropist [[John Purdue]], $50,000 from the county, and {{convert|100|acre|km2|1}} of land from local residents. On May 6, 1869, the General Assembly established the institution in Tippecanoe County as Purdue University, in the name of the principal benefactor. Classes began at Purdue on September 16, 1874, with six instructors and 39 students.&lt;ref name="purdue.edu"/&gt; Professor [[John S.

[[Emerson E. White]], the university’s president from 1876 to 1883, followed a strict interpretation of the Morrill Act. Rather than emulate the classical universities, White believed Purdue should be an "industrial college" and devote its resources toward providing a [[liberal education|liberal]] (or broad) education with an emphasis on science, technology, and agriculture. He intended not only to prepare students for industrial work, but also to prepare them to be good citizens and family members.&lt;ref&gt;Topping, pp. 89–94, 97–100.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of White's plan to distinguish Purdue from classical universities included a controversial attempt to ban fraternities. This ban was ultimately overturned by the [[Indiana Supreme Court]] and led to White's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;Topping, pp. 107–111.&lt;/ref&gt; The next president, [[James H. Smart]], is remembered for his call in 1894 to rebuild the original Heavilon Hall "one brick higher" after it had been destroyed by a fire.&lt;ref&gt;Topping, pp. 134–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1904 Panorama of campus, Purdue Univ.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Purdue University, 1904]]
By the end of the nineteenth century, the university was organized into schools of agriculture, engineering (mechanical, civil, and electrical), and pharmacy, and former U.S. President [[Benjamin Harrison]] was serving on the board of trustees.&lt;ref&gt;Topping, pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt; Purdue's engineering laboratories included testing facilities for a locomotive and a [[Corliss steam engine]], one of the most efficient engines of the time. The School of Agriculture was sharing its research with farmers throughout the state with its cooperative extension services and would undergo a period of growth over the following two decades. Programs in education and home economics were soon established, as well as a short-lived school of medicine. By 1925 Purdue had the largest undergraduate engineering enrollment in the country, a status it would keep for half a century.&lt;ref&gt;Topping, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Edward C. Elliott]] oversaw a campus building program between the world wars. Inventor, alumnus, and trustee [[David E. Ross]] coordinated several fundraisers, donated lands to the university, and was instrumental in establishing the Purdue Research Foundation. Ross's gifts and fundraisers supported such projects as [[Ross–Ade Stadium]], the [[Purdue Memorial Union|Memorial Union]], a civil engineering surveying camp, and [[Purdue University Airport]]. Purdue Airport was the country's first university-owned airport and the site of the country's first college-credit flight training courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aiaa.org/Participate/Uploads/05-0443westlafayette.pdf|title=Historic Aerospace Site: Purdue University Airport, West Lafayette, Indiana|author=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|year=2005|pages=2–3|format=PDF|accessdate=November 20, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201224602/http://www.aiaa.org/Participate/Uploads/05%2D0443westlafayette%2Epdf|archivedate=December 1, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amelia Earhart]] joined the Purdue faculty in 1935 as a consultant for these flight courses and as a counselor on women's careers. In 1937, the Purdue Research Foundation provided the funds for the [[Lockheed Model 10 Electra|Lockheed Electra 10-E]] Earhart flew on her attempted round-the-world flight.

Every school and department at the university was involved in some type of military research or training during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Topping, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; During a project on radar receivers, Purdue physicists discovered properties of [[germanium]] that led to the making of the first [[transistor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/semiconductor/timeline/1941-semiconductor.html |title=1941 – Semiconductor diode rectifiers serve in WW II|year=2007|work=The Silicon Engine: A Timeline of Semiconductors in Computers|publisher=[[Computer History Museum]] |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/transistor/science/info/germanium.html|title=Germanium Comes of Age|year=1999|work=Transistorized!

Bill]], first-year classes were taught at some of these sites to alleviate the demand for campus space. Four of these sites are now degree-granting regional campuses of the [[Purdue University system]]. Purdue's on-campus housing became racially desegregated in 1947, following pressure from Purdue President [[Frederick L. Hovde]] and Indiana Governor [[Ralph F. Gates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.lib.purdue.edu/orthefirenexttime|title=Or the Fire Next Time: A Timeline of African American History at Purdue|year=2010|author=Purdue Libraries, Archives and Special Collections|accessdate=November 20, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514184827/http://collections.lib.purdue.edu/orthefirenexttime/|archivedate=May 14, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Topping, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Hovde worked to expand the academic opportunities at the university. A decade-long construction program emphasized science and research. In the late 1950s and early 1960s the university established programs in veterinary medicine, industrial management, and nursing, as well as the first computer science department in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.purdue.edu/history/history.html|title=History of the Department of Computer Sciences at Purdue University|first1=John R.|last1=Rice|first2=Saul|last2=Rosen|year=1994|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=November 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216124633/http://www.cs.purdue.edu/history/history.html|archive-date=December 16, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Undergraduate humanities courses were strengthened, although Hovde only reluctantly approved of graduate-level study in these areas. Purdue awarded its first Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Topping, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; The programs in liberal arts and education, formerly administered by the School of Science, were soon split into their own school.

The official seal of Purdue was officially inaugurated during the university's centennial in 1969. Consisting of elements from emblems that had been used unofficially for 73 years, the current seal depicts a [[griffin]], symbolizing strength, and a three-part shield, representing education, research, and service.

In recent years, Purdue's leaders have continued to support high-tech research and international programs. In 1987, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] visited the West Lafayette campus to give a speech about the influence of technological progress on job creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reagan Hails U.S. Technology's Role|first=Gerald M.|last=Boyd |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/10/us/reagan-hails-us-technology-s-role.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 10, 1987|page=A12|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, the university added more opportunities to study abroad and expanded its course offerings in world languages and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Campus Life: Purdue; The Race Is On To Ready Students For Globalization|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/25/style/campus-life-purdue-the-race-is-on-to-ready-students-for-globalization.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 25, 1990|page=47|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first buildings of the Discovery Park interdisciplinary research center were dedicated in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?id=12097|title=Purdue Dedicates Center For Entrepreneurship|date=October 21, 2004|work=Inside Indiana Business|accessdate=November 20, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113133413/http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?id=12097|archivedate=January 13, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purdue launched a Global Policy Research Institute in 2010 to explore the potential impact of technical knowledge on public policy decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NSF director to lead new Purdue research institute|url=http://www.wthr.com/story/11939770/nsf-director-to-lead-new-purdue-research-institute|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=[[WTHR]]|date=February 5, 2010 |accessdate=June 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, 2017, Purdue University announced plans to acquire [[for-profit college]] [[Kaplan University]] and convert it to a public university in the state of Indiana, subject to multiple levels of approval.&lt;ref name="PurdueAnnounce20170427"&gt;{{cite web|title=Purdue to acquire Kaplan University, increase access for millions|url=https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2017/Q2/purdue-to-acquire-kaplan-university,-increase-access-for-millions.html|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That school now operates as [[Purdue University Global]], and aims to serve adult learners.

==Campus==

Purdue's campus is situated in the small city of [[West Lafayette, Indiana|West Lafayette]], near the western bank of the [[Wabash River]], across which sits the larger city of [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]]. State Street, which is concurrent with [[Indiana State Road 26|State Road 26]], divides the northern and southern portions of campus. Academic buildings are mostly concentrated on the eastern and southern parts of campus, with residence halls and intramural fields to the west, and athletic facilities to the north. The [[Greater Lafayette Public Transportation Corporation]] (CityBus) operates eight campus loop bus routes on which students, faculty, and staff can ride free of charge with Purdue Identification.

===Purdue Mall===

The Purdue Mall is the central quad of Purdue University. Also known as the Purdue Spine, due to its proximity to several important academic buildings, it was created to connect the academic campus with Ross-Ade Stadium.  It is known as the Engineering Mall, due to its proximity to several engineering buildings. The most prominent feature of the Purdue Mall is the {{convert|38|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall concrete [[Engineering Fountain]], and also features the [[Frederick L. Hovde]] Hall of Administration, which houses the office of the university president, [[Mitchell E. Daniels]]. The [[Purdue Bell Tower]] is between the Stadium and Centennial Malls. The Bell Tower is considered an icon of the university and can be found on many Purdue logos and those of the cities of [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]] and [[West Lafayette, Indiana|West Lafayette]].

Southwest of the Stadium Mall is the [[Edward C. Elliott Hall of Music]], one of the largest [[proscenium|proscenium theaters]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.housing.purdue.edu/HTML/HallOfMusic/venues/elliott/elliott.html|title=Hall of Music Productions – Venues – Purdue University|publisher=Housing.purdue.edu|date=September 30, 1990|accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purdue's Student Concert Committee often invites famous entertainers to perform there for an audience of students, faculty, and the public.

===Memorial Mall===
[[File:Purdue Student Union.JPG|thumb|right|Purdue Memorial Union]]
[[File:Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, Estados Unidos, 2012-10-15, DD 33.jpg|thumb|Union Club.]]
The Purdue Memorial Mall, south of the Purdue Mall, is the original section of campus. A popular meeting place for students, the grassy, open Memorial Mall is surrounded by the Stewart Center, Wetherill Laboratory of Chemistry, Stanley Coulter Hall, the Class of 1950 Lecture Hall, the Recitation Building, University Hall, and Stone Hall. The Memorial Mall also features the Hello Walk. Near this section of campus is Felix Haas Hall, which was constructed in 1909 as Memorial Gymnasium in memory of the 17 Purdue University football players, coaches, alumni, and fans who perished in the [[Purdue Wreck]] railroad accident on October 31, 1903. The structure was renovated in 1985 to house the Computer Science department. In 2006, it was renamed in honor of retired Provost Felix Haas and began to also house the Statistics department. East of the Memorial Mall is the [[Purdue Memorial Union]], Purdue's [[student activity center|student union]] building, and the adjacent Union Club Hotel.

University Hall is the only building remaining from the original six-building campus. Construction began in 1871, when the building was known as "The Main Building". The building was dedicated in 1877 and the project cost $35,000 to complete. University Hall originally housed the office of the president, a chapel, and classrooms, but was remodeled in 1961 to house only the department of history and classrooms used by the School of Liberal Arts. At the request of [[John Purdue]], he was buried in the Memorial Mall, directly across from the main entrance of University Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Purdue Libraries, Archives and Special Collections. (2009).

===South Campus===
[[File:Purdue Hort Gardens.jpg|thumb|Horticulture Gardens]]
The area south of State Street is home to Purdue's agricultural, fine arts, life sciences, and veterinary buildings. This area also includes the Krannert School of Management, [[Purdue University Horticulture Gardens|Horticulture Gardens]], [[Discovery Park (Purdue)|Discovery Park]], Lyles Porter Hall and the [[Purdue University Airport|Purdue Airport]]. The Krannert School of management has been nationally and globally ranked for both undergraduate and graduate degree programs. Krannert and Rawls Hall provide state of the art learning facilities to the majority of business classes on campus. Rawls Hall was built in 2006 with the help of a $10 million gift from Jerry S. Rawls, the largest in the management school's history. Lyles Porter Hall houses interdisciplinary healthcare facilities and classroom space within the College of Health and Human Sciences as well as the School of Medicine. Collectively, students and clinical faculty within Nursing, Health and Kinesiology, Nutrition Science, Psychological Sciences, and Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences see approximately 3,000 patients a year within this state-of-the-art interdisciplinary healthcare facility. The building features a nursing clinic, specialized preschool, exercise center, consultation space and demonstration kitchen for dietitians in training, clinical psychology facility, audiology and speech-language pathology clinics, cadaver laboratory for physicians in training, and research laboratories. Purdue University Airport, which opened in 1930 was the first of its kind, and remains one of only a few university-owned airports in the nation. Including the Niswonger Aviation Technology Building, which was dedicated in 2009, the facility symbolizes Purdue's storied relationship with aviation.

===West Campus===
The western portion of campus consists of student housing, dining, and recreation facilities. Students can play club and [[intramural sports]] at the Córdova Recreational Sports Center, the Morgan J. Burke Aquatic Center (named for former Purdue Men's Swimming &amp; Diving Captain and longtime Vice President &amp; Athletics Director), and the intramural playing fields in this area. The Córdova Recreational Sports Center, built in 1957, is the first building in the nation created solely to serve university student recreational needs. As a replacement for the previously separate women's and men's gymnasiums, it was originally called the "Co-recreational Gymnasium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Debris |accessdate=2012-07-19 |type=yearbook |year=1958 |publisher=Purdue University |location=West Lafayette, Indiana |page=293 |chapter=Co-recreational Gym increases I-M activity |chapterurl=http://earchives.lib.purdue.edu/u?/debris,40537 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite several expansions and official name changes, it has been nicknamed "the Co-rec" ever since.

===Stadium Avenue===

Much of the northern part of campus sits on land purchased for the university by industrialist David E. Ross and author and humorist [[George Ade]] in the 1920s. Many of Purdue's athletic facilities are there, including [[Ross–Ade Stadium]] ([[American football]]), [[Mackey Arena]] (basketball), and [[Lambert Fieldhouse]] (indoor track and field). This area also includes the [[Slayter Center of Performing Arts]] and Cary Quadrangle, one of the largest all-male housing units in the country.&lt;ref name="housing.purdue.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.housing.purdue.edu/HTML/Housing/Cary_Quadrangle|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807152841/http://www.housing.purdue.edu/HTML/Housing/Cary_Quadrangle/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-08-07|accessdate=2009-08-25|publisher=Purdue University Housing and Food Services|title=Cary Quadrangle}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Ross is one of three people buried on Purdue's campus, the others being John Purdue and former First Lady of Purdue, Jane Beering. Ross's and Beering's grave sites are in a garden atop Slayter Hill just to west of the Slayter band shell. Beering's husband, former Purdue President [[Steven C. Beering|Steven Beering]], will eventually join her atop the hill.&lt;ref name="wthr.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wthr.com/article/beering-burial-to-be-1st-on-purdue-campus-in-72-years|accessdate=2017-08-27|publisher=WTHR|title=Beering burial to be 1st on Purdue campus in 72 years}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Baseball's [[Alexander Field (Purdue University)|Alexander Field]] and other athletic facilities are a mile west of the stadium, at the newer Northwest Athletic Complex.

Purdue offers both [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] and [[graduate school|graduate]] programs in over 211 [[academic major|major]] areas of study, and is well known for its competitive engineering curricula. The university has also been highly influential in America's [[aviation history|history of aviation]], having established the first [[credit (education)|college credit]] offered in [[flight training]], the first four-year bachelor's degree in aviation, and the first university airport ([[Purdue University Airport]]). Purdue's aviation technology and aeronautical engineering programs remain among the most competitive aviation-specific programs in the world. In the mid-20th century, Purdue's aviation program expanded to encompass advanced [[spaceflight]] technology giving rise to Purdue's nickname, ''Cradle of Astronauts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.purdue.edu/UNS/astro/astromain.html|title=Purdue Astronauts|publisher=Purdue University News Service |accessdate=2006-06-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041216032631/http://www.purdue.edu/UNS/astro/astromain.html|archivedate=December 16, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-three Purdue graduates have gone on to become astronauts, including [[Gus Grissom]] (one of the original [[Mercury Seven]] astronauts), [[Neil Armstrong]] (the first person to walk on the moon), and [[Eugene Cernan]] (the last person to walk on the moon).

In addition to its strong engineering and science programs, the English Department at Purdue has achieved prominence for having created the first [[Online Writing Lab]] (OWL) in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/owlprint/608/|title=Purdue OWL|work=purdue.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many colleges and universities use the website for the Purdue OWL as a reference for the proper word usage, punctuation, grammar, and style in [[academic writing]].

Purdue is organized into ten colleges and schools. On July 1, 2010 the College of Health and Human Sciences was formed. The new college was created by combining existing academic units. These units include the School of Nursing, the School of Health Sciences, the College of Consumer and Family Sciences, and non-humanities majors from the College of Liberal Arts; namely psychology and hearing and speech pathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.purdue.edu/about/about.html|title=Purdue College of Health and Human Sciences|publisher=Hhs.purdue.edu|date=July 1, 2010|accessdate=November 1, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113171140/https://www.hhs.purdue.edu/about/about.html|archivedate=January 13, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university also offers 19 master's degree programs offered exclusively online, including for subjects like aviation management, communication, computer science, construction management, education, economics, and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://online.purdue.edu/online-programs/masters-degrees|title=Masters Degrees {{!}} Purdue University Online|website=online.purdue.edu|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administration===
The [[University President]], appointed by the [[Board of Trustees]], is the [[chief administrative officer]] of the university. The office of the president oversees admission and registration, student conduct and counseling, the administration and scheduling of classes and space, the administration of student athletics and organized extracurricular activities, the libraries, the appointment of the faculty and conditions of their employment, the appointment of all non-faculty employees and the conditions of employment, the general organization of the university, and the planning and administration of the university budget.

The Board of Trustees directly appoints other major officers of the university including a [[provost (education)|provost]], who serves as the chief academic officer for the university, a number of vice presidents with oversight over specific university operations, and the regional campus chancellors.

===Research===
The University expended $472.7 million in support of research system-wide in 2006–07, using funds received from the state and federal governments, industry, foundations, and individual donors. The faculty and more than 400 research laboratories put Purdue University among the leading research institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Purdue University – Facts Online – Research |url=https://www.purdue.edu/facts/research.html|accessdate=March 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Purdue University is considered by the [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]] to have "very high research activity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/lookup/view_institution.php?unit_id=243780 |title=Carnegie Classifications: Purdue University–Main Campus |publisher=Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching |accessdate=2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purdue also was rated the nation's fourth best place to work in academia, according to rankings released in November 2007 by ''[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gawrylewski|first=Andrea|url=http://classic.the-scientist.com/2007/11/1/67/1/|title=Purdue pushes forward |journal=The Scientist|date=November 1, 2007|volume=21|issue=11|page=67|accessdate=2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purdue's researchers provide insight, knowledge, assistance, and solutions in many crucial areas.

Purdue's library system consists of fifteen locations throughout the campus, including an archives and special collections research center, an undergraduate library, and several subject-specific libraries. More than three million volumes, including one million electronic books, are held at these locations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.purdue.edu/datadigest/AdditionalFact/Libraries.html Data Digest 2013-14: Libraries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501034922/http://www.purdue.edu/datadigest/AdditionalFact/Libraries.html |date=May 1, 2015 }}. Purdue University. Retrieved 2015-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; An administrative unit of [[Purdue University Libraries]], [[Purdue University Press]] has its roots in the 1960 founding of Purdue University Studies by President Frederick Hovde on a $12,000 grant from the Purdue Research Foundation. This was the result of a committee appointed by President Hovde after the Department of English lamented the lack of publishing venues in the humanities. Since the 1990s, the range of books published by the Press has grown to reflect the work from other colleges at Purdue University especially in the areas of agriculture, health, and engineering. Purdue University Press publishes print and ebook monograph series in a range of subject areas from literary and cultural studies to the study of the human-animal bond. In 1993 Purdue University Press was admitted to membership of the [[Association of American University Presses]]. Purdue University Press publishes around 25 books a year and 20 learned journals in print, in print &amp; online, and online only formats in collaboration with Purdue University Libraries.

Several campus-wide programs are planned by the Purdue Alumni Student Experience (part of the Alumni Association), [[Purdue Memorial Union|Purdue Student Union Board]], Purdue Student Government (PSG), or the Purdue Graduate Student Government (PGSG). PSG and PGSG are made up of representatives from each of the university's academic colleges and give recommendations to the faculty, administration, and sometimes to the state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=WBAA |date=May 4, 2012 |title=Indiana Lifeline measure becomes law |url=http://wbaa.org/post/indiana-lifeline-measure-becomes-law |last=Smith |first=Brandon |accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual campus events include Boiler Gold Rush, Purdue University Dance Marathon, Spring Fest, and Grand Prix. Boiler Gold Rush (BGR) is Purdue's new-student orientation program. BGR, which takes place before each fall semester, was formed to ease the transition to college for incoming students and to help them get acquainted with successful college life. Boiler Gold Rush activities include speaker presentations from various academic, cultural, safety and professional organizations on campus, campus tours led by Team Leaders, academic 'meet the schools' picnic and interest sessions, late night events at the Purdue Memorial Union, Recreational Sports Center and local stores, and a sports pep rally. Purdue University Dance Marathon (PUDM) is an 18-hour no-sitting, no-sleeping, dance marathon that takes place each fall in the Cordova Recreation center. Each year over 2,000 students participate and the event raises over $1,000,000 annually for Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. PUDM is also one of the largest collegiate Dance Marathons in the country. Spring Fest is an annual carnival with entertaining exhibits from many academic departments. A highlight of the weekend is the Entomology Department's Bug Bowl, where the sport of [[cricket spitting]] was invented in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Science Daily |title=Purdue Bug Bowl Bigger, Buggier And Better |date=April 6, 1999 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/04/990406042743.htm |accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lovitt |first=Rob |newspaper=NBC News |title=Travel's silly season: rat racing, cricket spitting and mullet tossing, oh my |date=April 12, 2012 |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/travel/travels-silly-season-rat-racing-cricket-spitting-mullet-tossing-oh-712573?franchiseSlug=todaytravelmain |accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Purdue Grand Prix]], a 50-mile, 160-lap go-kart race is "The Greatest Spectacle in College Racing" and wraps up Gala Week each year.

Currently, three radio stations operate from [[residence halls]], broadcasting via internet only; WCCR from Cary Quadrangle (not to be confused with the current WCCR FM or WCCR-LP stations in other states), WILY from Wiley Hall, and WHHR from Harrison Hall.&lt;ref name=WCCRwebsite&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.purdue.edu/WCCR|title=WCCR Website|publisher=Purdue.edu|date=September 1, 2005|accessdate=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WILYwebsite&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~wily/ |title=WILY Radio Website |publisher=Web.ics.purdue.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AM1610website&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.purdue.edu/radio|title=Purdue Student Radio AM1610 Website|publisher=Purdue.edu|accessdate=November 1, 2011}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WHHRwebsite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~whhr/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212170823/http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~whhr/index.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 12, 2009|title=Harrison Hall Radio Website|publisher=Web.ics.purdue.edu|accessdate=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

W9YB is the [[callsign]] of the [[Amateur Radio Club]] at Purdue University. W9YB is the longest standing club on campus and also holds the self declared title of having one of the largest and most active collegiate [[amateur radio]] stations in the country. W9YB actively participates in [[emergency management]] for the [[Tippecanoe County]] area and maintains ready status with its members in skills to assist. W9YB is among the longest standing amateur radio clubs in the United States, with the current callsign dating back to 1932 and the previous callsign 9YB dating back to 1920.&lt;ref name=w9ybwebsite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w9yb.org/ |title=W9YB Website |publisher=W9yb.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Purdue Boilermakers}}
[[File:Purdue Pete.svg|thumb|150px|[[Purdue Pete]]]]
On October 26, 1891, a newspaper in Crawfordsville, Indiana, called Purdue's football team the "Boiler Makers" when writing about their trouncing of [[Wabash College]]. Lafayette newspapers soon picked up the name, and in October 1892, The Purdue Exponent, Purdue's student newspaper, gave it the stamp of approval. In the early days of Purdue football, the team was called other names as well, including "haymakers," "railsplitters," "sluggers," and "cornfield sailors." This heritage is reflected in Purdue's current mascots: the [[Boilermaker Special]] (a truck-like vehicle that resembles a locomotive) and [[Purdue Pete]] (a muscular hammer-wielding [[boilermaker]]). The school colors of [[old gold]] and black were selected by Purdue's first football team in 1887 to resemble the orange and black of [[Princeton Tigers football|Princeton's]] then-successful team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://purduesports.cstv.com/trads/old-gold-black.html|title=Purdue Official Athletic Site|publisher=Purduesports.cstv.com|accessdate=2010-01-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219185706/http://purduesports.cstv.com/trads/old-gold-black.html|archive-date=February 19, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best known fight song is "[[Hail Purdue!]]".

Purdue has one of the few college athletic programs not funded by student fees or subsidized by the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.purdueexponent.org/sports/mens/basketball/article_11feca98-96f0-11e0-96f5-0019bb30f31a.html|title=Purdue athletics maintains stance on not paying athletes|publisher=Purdue Exponent|accessdate=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://b2.caspio.com/dp.asp?AppKey=900c1000ea466e223e104a22814a |title=CSM0810 Search and Report |publisher=B2.caspio.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is home to 18 Division I/I-A [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] teams including football, basketball, cross country, tennis, wrestling, golf, volleyball, ice hockey ([[American Collegiate Hockey Association|ACHA]]), and others. Purdue is a founding member of the [[Big Ten Conference]], and played a central role in its creation. Traditional rivals include Big Ten colleagues the [[Indiana Hoosiers]] (see [[Indiana–Purdue rivalry]]), the [[Illinois Fighting Illini]], and the [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] [[Fighting Irish]] from the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (football program independent, however).

Purdue's baseball facility was named in honor of two alumni, [[Anna Margaret Ross Alexander]] and her husband, John Arthur Alexander, when the new stadium was dedicated in 2013.&lt;ref name="Purdue Sports (2013)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Alexander Field Dedication Ceremony Set For Saturday Evening|url=http://www.purduesports.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/041713aaa.html |accessdate=10 April 2015|publisher=Purdue Sports|date=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Football===

The [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Boilermaker football team]] represents Purdue University in the NCAA [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS). [[Jeff Brohm]] is Purdue's current head coach, the 36th in the program's history. Purdue plays its home games at Ross-Ade Stadium on the campus of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. The Boilermakers compete in the Big Ten Conference as a member of the West Division. With a 592–515–48 record, Purdue has the 49th most victories among NCAA FBS programs. Purdue was originally classified as a Major College school in the 1937 season until 1972. Purdue received Division I classification in 1973, becoming a Division I-A program from 1978 to 2006 and an FBS program from 2006 to the present. The Boilermakers have registered 64 winning seasons in their history, with 19 of those seasons resulting in eight victories or more, 10 seasons resulting in at least nine wins, and just one season with ten victories or more. Of those successful campaigns, Purdue has produced five unbeaten seasons in its history, going 4–0 in 1891, 8–0 in 1892, 8–0 in 1929, 7–0–1 in 1932 and 9–0 in 1943. The Boilermakers have won a total of 12 conference championships in their history, including four Indiana Intercollegiate Athletic Association titles and eight Big Ten Conference titles. The program is also notable for being one of only two universities – the other being the [[University of Alabama]] – to produce three [[Super Bowl]]-winning [[quarterback]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Notre Dame, Stanford have most Super Bowl starts at QB|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000321044/article/notre-dame-stanford-have-most-super-bowl-starts-at-qb|publisher=[[National Football League|NFL]]|date=January 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AL HAMNIK: Purdue QB greats love rocking that cradle|url=http://www.nwitimes.com/sports/college/article_de3e096c-bbdf-5964-b5c9-b506edf91b69.html|publisher=[[The Times of Northwest Indiana]]|date=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Found on a farm in southern [[Indiana]], the [[Old Oaken Bucket]] is one of the oldest football trophies in the nation. The winner of the annual Purdue vs. [[Indiana University]] [[American football]] game gets to add a bronze "P" or "I" chain link and keep the trophy until the next face-off. Ironically, the first competition in 1925 led to a 0–0 tie, resulting in the first link on the chain being an "IP." Purdue currently leads the trophy series at 57-27-3.

During "Breakfast Club", best described as a cross between a pep rally and a Halloween party, students and even some alumni dress up in costumes, from traditional Halloween garb to creative hand-made costumes, as they bar-hop before Boilermaker home football games.  The Breakfast Club plays a significant role during the football season and is informally a part of Purdue tradition.  Many Boilermaker fans are dedicated; getting up at 5&amp;nbsp;am on Saturdays and lining up at the bars on Chauncey Hill and the levee by 6&amp;nbsp;am. The Breakfast Club tradition also takes place the day of the annual [[Purdue Grand Prix]] race in April.

===Basketball===
The [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball|Purdue Boilermakers basketball]] team competes in NCAA Division I and is a member of the Big Ten Conference. In 2005, [[Matt Painter]] became the head coach in West Lafayette. Painter took over the head coaching job from the winningest coach in school history, [[Gene Keady]], becoming the second former Boilermaker basketball player to take the lead role. Purdue basketball won its 23rd Big 10 Conference Championship in 2017. This mark leads the conference, as Indiana University is second with 22. The Boilermakers have reached two NCAA Tournament Final Fours and won a non-NCAA recognized National Championship for the 1932 season, awarded several years later by the Helms Athletic Foundation. It has sent more than 30 players to the NBA including two overall No. 1 picks in the NBA draft. Purdue shares a traditional rivalry with in-state foe [[Indiana University]], and holds a 112-88 series lead. The Boilermaker men's and women's basketball teams have won more Big Ten Championships than any other conference school, with 27 conference titles. Purdue men's basketball has an all-time winning record against all Big Ten schools except Ohio State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Pure alexia results from cerebral lesions in circumscribed brain regions and therefore belongs to the group of acquired reading disorders, [[Alexia (condition)|alexia]],&lt;ref name="Acquired dyslexia"/&gt; as opposed to [[dyslexia|developmental dyslexia]] found in children who have difficulties in learning to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Temple CM |title=Developmental and acquired dyslexias |journal=Cortex |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=898–910 |date=August 2006 |pmid=17131596 |doi=10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70434-9 |url=http://www.cortexjournal.net/article/S0010-9452%2808%2970434-9/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Pure alexia almost always involves an infarct to the left [[posterior cerebral artery]] (which perfuses the [[splenium of the corpus callosum]] and left [[visual cortex]], among other things). The resulting deficit will be pure alexia – i.e., the patient can write but cannot read (even what they have just written).  However, because pure alexia affects visual input, not auditory input, patients with pure alexia can recognize words that are spelled out loud to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlson|first1=Neil R.|title=Physiology of behavior|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=Boston|isbn=0-205-23939-0|page=501|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the left visual cortex has been damaged, leaving only the right visual cortex ([[occipital lobe]]) able to process visual information, but it is unable to send this information to the language areas ([[Broca's area]], [[Wernicke's area]], etc.) in the left brain because of the damage to the [[splenium]] of the corpus callosum. Patients with this deficit mostly do have a stroke to the posterior cerebral artery. But they may be susceptible to pure alexia as a consequence of other traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) as well. Anything that stops proper blood flow to the area necessary for normal reading abilities will cause a form of alexia.&lt;ref name="Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P.

It also supplies the anterior temporal branches, the posterior temporal branches, the calcarrine branch, and the parieto-occipital branch.&lt;ref name="Petersen, A., Vangkilde, S., Fabricius, C., Iversen, H., Delfi, T., &amp; Starrfelt, R. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Petersen, A., Vangkilde, S., Fabricius, C., Iversen, H., Delfi, T., &amp; Starrfelt, R.|title= Visual Attention in Posterior Stroke and Relations to Alexia |journal= Neuropsychologia |date=2015 |doi=10.1044/2015_JSLHR-L-14-0286 |url= |volume=58 |page=1521|pmc=4686312}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is important about these arteries is their location. All of them supply blood to the back outer parts of the brain.&lt;ref name="Imaging"&gt;{{cite web|title=Imaging|url= http://ophthalmology.stanford.edu/blog/archives/imaging/ |date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the brain is also referred to as the posterior lateral part of the brain. In cases of pure alexia, locations are found in the section of the brain, specifically the temporo-occipital area.&lt;ref name="Petersen, A., Vangkilde, S., Fabricius, C., Iversen, H., Delfi, T., &amp; Starrfelt, R. 2015"/&gt; This is the area that is activated when people without any sort of alexia receive activation when undergoing orthographic processing. This area is known as the visual word form area due to this pattern of activation.&lt;ref name="Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. 2015"/&gt;

These people typically adapt to their disability and are able to use a style of compensatory reading known as letter-by-letter reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexia|url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/friedmar/alexia.html|website=Cognitive Neuropsychology Laboratory|publisher=Center for Aphasia Research and Rehabilitation|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of reading takes longer than the conventional style of reading does. As the number of letters in a word increases, the amount of time it takes for the person with pure alexia increases. For each letter that is added, a patient may take up to an additional three seconds to read the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montant|first1=Marie|last2=Behrmann|first2=Marlene|title=Pure Alexia|journal=Neurocase|date=2000|volume=6|pages=265–294|url=https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~behrmann/dlpapers/MontantBehrmann.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2015|doi=10.1080/13554790008402777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that pure alexia may be a result of a disconnection syndrome. Analysis of diffusion images showed that the visual word form area (VWFA) is connected to the occipital lobe via the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), a projection that runs between the temporal and occipital lobe. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) showed that two weeks after surgery in the ILF, the VWFA-Occipital Lobe tract was severely degenerated. The results came from an epileptic patient who showed symptoms of pure alexia after his surgery. Thus, the proposed pathophysiological mechanism is that the ILF lesion interferes with transmission of visual information to the VWFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epelbaum|first1=S.|title=Pure alexia as a disconnection syndrome: New diffusion imaging evidence for an old concept|journal=Cortex|date=2008|volume=44|issue=8|pages=962–974|accessdate=|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2008.05.003|pmid=18586235}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, an alternative view that suggests the "VWFA" is devoted to processing of high acuity foveal input, which is particularly salient for complex visual stimuli like letter strings. Studies have highlighted disrupted processing of non-linguistic visual stimuli after damage to the left pFG, both for familiar and unfamiliar objects &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=DJ|last2=Woollams|first2=AM|last3=Kim|first3=E|last4=Beeson|first4=PM|last5=Rapcsak|first5=SZ|last6=Lambon Ralph|first6=MA|title=Efficient Visual Object and Word Recognition Relies on High Spatial Frequency Coding in the Left Posterior Fusiform Gyrus: Evidence from a Case-Series of Patients with Ventral Occipito-Temporal Cortex Damage|journal=Cerebral Cortex|date=24 August 2012|volume=23|issue=11|pages=2568–2580|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhs224|pmid=22923086|pmc=3792736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=DJ|last2=Lambon Ralph|first2=MA|last3=Kim|first3=ES|last4=Tainturier|first4=MJ|last5=Beeson|first5=PM|last6=Rapcsak|first6=SZ|last7=Woollams|first7=AM|title=Processing deficits for familiar and novel faces in patients with left posterior fusiform lesions|journal=Cortex|date=November 2015|volume=72|pages=79–96|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2015.02.003|pmid=25837867|pmc=4643682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure alexia exhibits some unexpected residual abilities despite the inability to read words. For instance, one patient had preserved calculation capabilities such as deciding which number was greater, and whether a number was odd or even with greater than chance probability. The study showed that the patient was also able to calculate simple arithmetic tasks such as addition, subtraction, and division, but not multiplication, even though the patient could not read the numbers. For example, the patient would be presented with "8 – 6", and he or she would read it as "five minus four", but still come up with the correct answer "two" with greater than chance accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=L.|title=Calculating Without Reading: Unsuspected Residual Abilities In Pure Alexia|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|date=2000|volume=17|issue=6|pages=563–583|accessdate=|doi=10.1080/02643290050110656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure alexia patients also seem to retain some residual semantic processing. They are able to perform better than chance when forced to make a lexical decision or make a semantic-categorisation decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=DJ|last2=Lambon Ralph|first2=MA|last3=Woollams|first3=AM|title=When does less yield more?

However, this may be due to right hemisphere input or residual left hemisphere input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coslett|first1=H.B.|title=Evidence For Preserved Reading In ‘Pure Alexia’|journal=Brain|date=1989|volume=112|issue=2|pages=327–359|accessdate=|doi=10.1093/brain/112.2.327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
In patients, a common symptom is letter-by-letter reading or LBL. This action is a compensatory strategy which these patients use in order to come up with a semblance of reading.&lt;ref name="Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. 2015"/&gt; It is essentially looking at the consonants and vowels of the word and sounding them out as they sound. However, this method does not always work, especially for words like 'phone' where the ph sounds like an f, but if sounded out, does not sound like an f. Also, by reading words in the fashion, the rate at which patients read words is much slower compared to people who do not have this disability. Petersen et al. proved that the issue of reading time had more to do with the length of the words than reading ability. The team had 4 patients with right hemisphere damage and 4 patients with left hemisphere damage in the temporo-occipital lobes as well as 26 controls were shown one word at a time on a screen. They were exposed to 20 words of 3 and 5 letters, 12 words of 7 letters. The subjects were asked to read the words as quickly and as accurately as possible. The patients with left hemisphere lesions consistently read the longer words slower than the controls despite the difficulty of the word.&lt;ref name="Petersen, A., Vangkilde, S., Fabricius, C., Iversen, H., Delfi, T., &amp; Starrfelt, R. 2015"/&gt; It is thought that as the word gets longer, the letters on the outsides of the word go into peripheral vision, making the patient shift their attention thus making the patient take longer to read.

==Rehabilitation==
Though there have been ample attempts to rehabilitate patients with pure alexia, few have proven to be effective on a large scale. Most rehabilitation practices have been specialized to a single patient or small patient group. At the simplest level, patients seeking rehabilitation are asked to practice reading words aloud repeatedly. This is meant to stimulate the damaged system of the brain. This is known as multiple oral re-reading (MOR) treatment. This is a text-based approach that is implemented in order to prevent patients from LBL reading. MOR works by reading aloud the same text repeatedly until certain criteria are reached.&lt;ref name="Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. 2015"/&gt; The most important criteria for a pure alexic patient is reading at an improved rate. The treatment aims to shift patients away from the LBL reading strategy by strengthening links between visual input and the associated orthographic representations. This repetition supports the idea of using top-down processing initially minimize the effects peripheral processing which were demonstrated in the study above.&lt;ref name="Kim, E. S., Rising, K., Rapcsak, S. Z., &amp; Beeson, P. M. 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Imaging"/&gt; From here, the goal is to increase bottom-up processing. This will hopefully aid in word recognition and promote interactive processing of all available information to support reading. 'The supported reading stimulation from MOR has a rehabilitative effect so that reading rate and accuracy are better for untrained text, and word-form recognition improves as evidenced by a reduced word-length effect.'&lt;ref name="Petersen, A., Vangkilde, S., Fabricius, C., Iversen, H., Delfi, T., &amp; Starrfelt, R. 2015"/&gt; These tactics have seen quite good success. 
Another tactic that has been employed is the use of cross modal therapy. In this therapy, patients are asked to trace the words in which they are trying to read aloud. There has been success using cross modal therapy such as kinaesthetic or motor-cross cuing therapy, but tends to be a more feasible approach for those on the slower reading end of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leff|first1=Alexander P.|last2=Schofield|first2=T.

'''Qashani''' or '''Kashani''' is a [[Persian Empire|Persian]] decorative arts which had been popular in [[Iran]] in the 16th to 18th century, and then moved to [[Turkey]] in the time of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] with the transfer of many Persians artists to Turkey, becoming the basis for decorating the walls of [[mosque]]s, palaces, shrines and tombs. It is a square-shaped ceramic tile which uses Persian-like floral-depicting 4- or 6-sided glazed tiles, decorated with blue, cyan, green and sometimes red colors. The decoration is surrounded by fine black lines that make it stand out on its white floor. The tile work had often been decorated by the inscription, floral and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometrical pattern]]s. The inscription often provides [[Qur'an]]ic verses or sentences related to historical events written in Persian script. The plant often consists of natural flowers such as lily, cloves, roses and cypress trees. Geometrical patterns consists of different geometrical shapes and polygons. In [[Morocco]], similar artistic technique is known as [[zellige|''zillij'']]. Its use has been widespread in the decoration of the walls of the buildings in the Ottoman era, and this mosaical feature can also be seen in the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]]. Kashi, the abbreviated form of Qashani, was also introduced to [[Sindh]], [[Kutch]], and [[Multan]] where numerous examples of shrines and mosques embellished with blue, white and green tile work exist.&lt;ref&gt; Leadless Decorative Tiles, Faience, and Mosaic: 
William James Furnival - 1904 - This style of decoration is called Kashani, after Kashan in Persia, one of the chief seats of earthenware manufacture .&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rave''' (from the [[verb]]: ''[[wikt:rave#English|to rave]]'') is an organised dance party at a [[nightclub]], outdoor festival, warehouse, or other private property typically featuring performances by [[Disc jockeys|DJ]]s, playing a seamless flow of [[electronic dance music]]. DJs at rave events play electronic dance music on vinyl, CDs and digital audio from a wide range of genres, including [[techno]],&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/02/how-rave-music-conquered-america&lt;/ref&gt; [[hardcore (electronic dance music genre)|hardcore]], [[house music|house]],&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; [[drum &amp; bass]],&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2273707/Mother-41-takes-month-old-baby-drum-bass-rave-Wales.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dummymag.com/lists/the-10-best-drum-and-bass-tracks-according-to-goldie&lt;/ref&gt; [[dubstep]],&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; and [[post-industrial music|post-industrial]]. Occasionally [[Live music|live]] performers have been known to perform, in addition to other types of performance artists such as [[go-go dancers]] and [[Fire performance|fire dancers]]. The music is amplified with a large, powerful [[sound reinforcement system]], typically with large [[subwoofer]]s to produce a deep bass sound. The music is often accompanied by [[Laser lighting display|laser light shows]], [[Image projector|projected coloured images]], [[visual effects]] and [[fog machines]].

While some raves may be small parties held at nightclubs or private homes, some raves have grown to immense size, such as the large festivals and events featuring multiple DJs and dance areas (e.g., the [[Castlemorton Common Festival]] in 1992). Some [[list of electronic music festivals|electronic dance music festivals]] have features of raves, but on a larger, often commercial scale. Raves may last for a long time, with some events continuing for twenty-four hours, and lasting all through the night. [[Law enforcement]] raids and anti-rave laws have presented a challenge to the rave scene in many countries.  This is due to the association of illegal drugs such as [[MDMA]]&lt;ref name="drugabuse"&gt;https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/club-drugs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nih"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4458153/&lt;/ref&gt; (often referred to as a "[[club drug]]" or "party drug" along with [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejournal.ie/scott-weiland-drugs-death-2511702-Dec2015/&lt;/ref&gt;), [[LSD]],&lt;ref name="drugabuse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt; [[gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]],&lt;ref name="drugabuse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt; [[ketamine]],&lt;ref name="drugabuse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://qz.com/681175/ketamine-better-known-as-the-rave-drug-special-k-could-be-our-next-anti-depressant/&lt;/ref&gt; [[methamphetamine]],&lt;ref name="drugabuse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt; [[cocaine]],&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt; and [[cannabis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ministryofcannabisblog.com/2018/02/06/marijuana-in-the-rave-culture-of-the-90s/&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to drugs, raves often make use of non-authorized, secret venues, such as [[squat parties]] at unoccupied homes,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.propertyguardianprotection.com/blog/rave-squat-party-revival&lt;/ref&gt; unused warehouses,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/16/illegal-raves-return-with-social-media-messages&lt;/ref&gt; or aircraft hangars.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/66df895b-af1c-416f-b32a-bb3576dbcb82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-ravers-return-how-underground-parties-are-making-a-comeback-a7036131.html&lt;/ref&gt; These concerns are often attributed to a type of [[moral panic]] surrounding rave culture.

People who were gregarious party animals were described as "ravers". Pop musicians such as [[Steve Marriott]] of [[The Small Faces]] and [[Keith Moon]] of [[The Who]] were self-described "ravers".{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Presaging the word's subsequent 1980s association with [[electronic music]], the word "rave" was a common term used regarding the music of mid-1960s [[garage rock]] and [[psychedelia]] bands (most notably [[The Yardbirds]], who released an album in the US called ''[[Having a Rave Up]]''). Along with being an alternative term for partying at such garage events in general, the "rave-up" referred to a specific crescendo moment near the end of a song where the music was played faster, more heavily and with intense soloing or elements of controlled feedback. It was later part of the title of an [[electronic music]] performance event held on 28 January 1967 at London's [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] titled the "Million Volt Light and Sound Rave". The event featured the only known public airing of an experimental sound collage created for the occasion by [[Paul McCartney]] of [[The Beatles]] – the legendary ''[[Carnival of Light]]'' recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| quote = Perhaps the most famous event that Unit Delta Plus participated in was the 1967 ''Million Volt Light and Sound Rave'' at London's Roundhouse, organised by designers Binder, Edwards and Vaughan (who had previously been hired by Paul McCartney to decorate a piano). The event took place over two nights (28 January and 4 February 1967) and included a performance of tape music by Unit Delta Plus, as well as a playback of the legendary ''Carnival of Light'', a fourteen-minute sound collage assembled by McCartney around the time of the Beatles' ''Penny Lane'' sessions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rapid change of British pop culture from the mod era of 1963–1966 to the [[hippie]] era of 1967 and beyond, the term fell out of popular usage. During the 1970s and early 1980s until its resurrection, the term was not in vogue, one notable exception being in the lyrics of the song "[[Drive-In Saturday]]" by [[David Bowie]] (from his 1973 album ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'') which includes the line, "It's a crash course for the ravers." Its use during that era would have been perceived as a quaint or ironic use of bygone slang: part of the dated 1960s lexicon along with words such as "groovy".

The perception of the word "rave" changed again in the late 1980s when the term was revived and adopted by a new youth culture, possibly inspired by the use of the term in Jamaica.&lt;ref name="outofsight"/&gt;

===Birth of acid house (1980s)===
[[File:Rave - Juiz de Fora - MG.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Rave – Juiz de Fora – MG, featuring bright psychedelic theming common at many raves.]]

In the mid to late 1980s, a wave of psychedelic and other [[electronic dance music]], most notably [[acid house]] music, emerged from [[acid house music party|acid house music parties]] in the mid-to-late 1980s in the [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] area in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://music.hyperreal.org/library/history_of_house.html |title = The History Of House |accessdate = August 13, 2013 | author = Phil Cheeseman-fu |publisher = ''[[DJ Magazine]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Chicago acid house artists began experiencing overseas success, acid house quickly spread and caught on in the [[United Kingdom]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantazia.org.uk/Scene/themusic.htm|title=Acid House Music – The Timeline (The History of House – "Garage, Techno, Jungle.

In the late 1980s, the word "rave" was adopted to describe the [[subculture]] that grew out of the acid house movement.&lt;ref name="Simon Parkin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperreal.org/raves/database/visuale/ve1.htm|title=Visual Energy|author=Simon Parkin|date=May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activities were related to the party atmosphere of [[Ibiza]], a Mediterranean island in Spain, frequented by British, Italian, Greek, Irish and German youth on vacation, who would hold raves and dance parties.&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;"The Problem of Rave Parties", Michael S. Scott, Center for Problem Oriented Policing, 2009, webpage: [http://www.popcenter.org/problems/rave_parties/ popc-rave].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth of the scene (1990s–present)===
[[File:MTAC Prime Rave dance.ogv|thumb|right|200px|dancing at a rave in 2007]]
{{see also|List of electronic dance music festivals|Doof}}
By the 1990s, genres such as [[Acid house|acid]], [[breakbeat hardcore]], [[hardcore (electronic dance music)|hardcore]], [[happy hardcore]], [[gabber]], [[post-industrial music|post-industrial]] and [[electronica]] were all being featured at raves, both large and small. There were mainstream events which attracted thousands of people (up to 25,000{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}&lt;!-- Previously cited with a ref named "Energy Flash" if anyone knows what happened to that. --&gt; instead of the 4,000 that came to earlier warehouse parties). Acid house music parties were first re-branded "rave parties" in the media, during the summer of 1989 by [[Genesis P-Orridge]] (Neil Andrew Megson) during a television interview; however, the ambience of the rave was not fully formed until the early 1990s. In 1990, raves were held "underground" in several cities, such as [[Berlin]], [[Milan]] and [[Patras]], in basements, warehouses and forests.&lt;ref name="Generation Ecstasy"&gt;Timeline and numbers {{cite book

British politicians responded with hostility to the emerging rave party trend. Politicians spoke out against raves and began to [[fine (penalty)|fine]] promoters who held unauthorized parties. Police crackdowns on these often unauthorized parties drove the rave scene into the countryside. The word "rave" somehow caught on in the UK to describe common semi-spontaneous weekend parties occurring at various locations linked by the brand new [[M25 motorway|M25 London orbital]] motorway that ringed London and the [[Home Counties]]. (It was this that gave the band [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]] their name.) These ranged from former warehouses and industrial sites in London, to fields and country clubs in the countryside.

Prior to the commercialization of the rave scene, when large legal venues became the norm for these events, the location of the rave was kept secret until the night of the event, usually being communicated through [[answering machine]] messages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-39960232|title=The rave that changed the law|last=Chester|first=Jerry|date=2017-05-28|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; mobile messaging, secret flyers, and websites. This level of secrecy, necessary for avoiding any interference by the police, on account of the illicit drug use, enabled the ravers to use locations they could stay in for ten hours at a time.  It promoted the sense of deviance and removal from social control.&lt;ref&gt;Tammy L. Anderson, "Understanding the Alteration and Decline of a Music Scene: Observations from Rave Culture". ''Sociological Forum'', vol.24 no.2 (2009) 309–311. Accessed 10/02/2013 16:19, Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/40210403 .&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 2000s, this level of secrecy still exists in the underground rave scene.  However "after-hours" clubs, as well as large outdoor events, create a similar type of alternate atmosphere, but focus much more on vibrant visual effects, such as props and décor. In more recent years,{{When|date=November 2017}} large commercial events are held at the same locations year after year with similar reoccurring themes every year. Events like [[Electric Daisy Carnival]] and [[Tomorrowland (festival)|Tomorrowland]] are typically held at the same venue that holds mass numbers of people.

Some raves make use of [[paganism|pagan]] symbolism.  Modern raving venues attempt to immerse the raver in a fantasy-like world.  Indigenous imagery and spirituality can be characteristic in the Raving ethos.  In both the New Moon and Gateway collectives, "pagan altars are set up, sacred images from primitive cultures decorate the walls, and rituals of cleansing are performed over the turntables and the dance floor"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hutson | first1 = Scott R. | year = 2000 | title = The Rave: Spiritual Healing in Modern Western Subcultures | journal = Anthropological Quarterly | volume = 73 | issue = 1| pages = 40–41 | jstor=3317473}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of spatial strategy is an integral part of the raving experience because it sets the initial "vibe" in which the ravers will immerse themselves.  This said "vibe" is a concept in the raver ethos that represents the allure and receptiveness of an environment's portrayed and or innate energy.  The landscape is an integral feature in the composition of rave, much like it is in pagan rituals.  For example, The Numic Ghost Dancers rituals were held on specific geographical sites, considered to hold powerful natural flows of energy.  These sites were later represented in the rhythmic dances, in order to achieve a greater level of connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carroll | first1 = Alex K. | last2 = Zedeno | first2 = M.

===Dancing===

[[File:T-Step.gif|thumb|right|T-step of the [[Melbourne Shuffle]]]]
A sense of participation in a group event is among the chief appeals of rave music and dancing to pulsating beats is its immediate outlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Joining In: An investigation in participatory music | author=Everit, Anthony | quote=A rave or a rock concert is not simply a presentation which audiences attend, but a communal event (like a secular church service) in which everyone has an active part. | url=http://www.gulbenkian.org.uk/pdffiles/Joining-in-text-no-photos.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731195611/http://www.gulbenkian.org.uk/pdffiles/Joining-in-text-no-photos.pdf | archivedate=31 July 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Music as Social Life: The Politics of Participation. | publisher=Chicago: University of Chicago Press | author=Turino, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raving in itself is a syllabus-free dance, whereby the movements are [[freestyle dance|not predefined and the dance is performed randomly]], dancers take immediate inspiration from the music, their mood and watching other people dancing. Thus, the electronic, rave and club dances refer to the [[street dance]] styles that evolved alongside electronic music culture. Such dances are street dances since they evolved alongside the underground rave and club movements, without the intervention of [[dance studios]]. These dances were originated in some 'scenes' around the world, becoming known only to ravers or clubgoers who attempt to these locations. They were originated at some point that certain moves had begun to be performed to several people at those places, creating a completely freestyle, yet still highly complex set of moves, adaptable to every dancer change and dance whatever they want based on these moves. Many rave dancing techniques suggest using your body as an extension of the music, to loosen up, and let the music flow through the body to create a unique form of movement.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

A common feature shared by all these dances, alongside with being originated at clubs, raves and music festivals around the world and in different years, is that when [[YouTube]] and other social media started to become popular (around 2006), these dances began to be popularized by videos of raves performing them, recording and uploading their videos.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Therefore, they began to be practiced outside their places of origin, creating different 'scenes' in several countries. Furthermore, some of these dances began to evolve, and these dance 'scenes' are not totally related to the club/rave scenes they were originated. Also, the way of teaching and learning them have changed. In the past, if someone wanted to learn one of these dances, the person had to go to a club/rave, watch people dancing and try to copy them. Now,{{When|date=November 2017}} with social media, these dances are mostly taught on video tutorials and the culture spreads and grows inside those social media, like Flogger on [[Fotolog]], Rebolation, Sensualize and Free Step on [[Orkut]] and Cutting Shapes on [[Instagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/100325/1/Heller_David_r.pdf|title=I-Rave: digiphrenia's transformation of a culture|first=David|last=Heller|publisher=[[University of Hawai'i at Mãnoa]]|accessdate=November 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due the lack of studies dedicated to those dances, combined with poor and inaccurate information of them available on the Internet, it is hard to find reliable information.

The loose, casual and sports clothing was originally adopted by the acid house set earlier on in [[Ibiza]], utilizing easy-to-dance-in attire from hip hop and football/soccer culture. As well as clothing there developed a range of accessories carried by many ravers including: [[Vicks VapoRub]], which ravers find pleasant under the influence of MDMA, [[pacifier]]s to satiate the need to grind one's teeth ([[bruxism]]) caused by taking MDMA, and [[glow stick]]s which adjunct the mild [[psychedelia]] of MDMA's effect.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In the United States and other countries, rave fashion is characterized by colorful clothing and accessories, most notably "kandi" jewellery, that [[Fluorescence|fluoresce]] under ultraviolet light. They contain words or phrases that are unique to the raver and they can choose to trade with each other using "PLUR" (Peace, Love, Unity, Respect). In European countries, this kandi culture is much less common. Most raves are illegal and take place outside or in poorly heated warehouses, so keeping warm is a priority.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[Dreadlocks]], dyed hair and [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawks]] are popular, as are tattoos and piercings. Clothing is vibrant and alternative, often taking inspiration from new-age [[punk rock|punk]] and [[grunge]] style. However, there is no set dress code for the illegal rave scene.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Some global rave events such as [[Sensation (event)|Sensation]] adopted a strict minimalistic dress policy, either all white or black attire.

Since rave culture has seen such an explosion in the US since 2010 as the rave scene is no longer illegal or underground, raves in the US are now{{When|date=November 2017}} so popular that there are many brands, retailers, and websites selling apparel, costumes, and accessories just for those who go to dress up at raves. This style of attire, along with the entire rave culture, is now{{When|date=November 2017}} spilling out into the mainstream, especially in the US. Sometimes called "rave fashion" or "festival fashion," it now includes all kinds of accessories to create unique looks depending on the person and event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/the-evolution-of-rave-fashion-4391090|title=The Evolution of Rave Fashion|author=Mary Grace Cerni|work=L.A.

Some ravers participate in one of four light-oriented dances, called ''glowsticking'', ''glowstringing'', ''gloving'', and ''lightshows''. Of the four types of light-orientated dances, gloving in particular has evolved beyond and outside of the rave culture. Other types of light-related dancing include [[LED]] lights, flash-lights and blinking strobe lights. LEDs come in various colours with different settings.
[[Gloving]] has evolved into a separate dance form that has grown exponentially in the last couple of years.{{When|date=November 2017}}  Since then the culture has extended to all ages, ranging from kids in their early teens to college students and more. The traditional Rav'n lights are limited now, but many stores have developed newer, brighter, and more advanced version of lights with a plethora of colors and modes—modes include solid, stribbon, strobe, dops, hyper flash, and other variations.

Among the various elements of 1970s disco subculture that ravers drew on, in addition to basing their scene around dance music mixed by [[DJ]]s, ravers also inherited the positive attitude towards using [[club drug]]s to "enhanc[e]...the sensory experience" of dancing to loud music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2004/0601/p2619.html|title=Club Drugs: MDMA, Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate (GHB), Rohypnol, and Ketamine|first=Paul M.|last=Gahlinger|date=1 June 2004|journal=American Family Physician|volume=69|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, disco dancers and ravers preferred different drugs. Whereas 1970s disco scene members preferred [[cocaine]] and the depressant/sedative [[Quaaludes]], ravers preferred MDMA, 2C-B, [[amphetamine]], [[morphine]] and other pills. According to the FBI, raves are one of the most popular venues where [[club drugs]] are distributed, and as such feature a prominent drug subculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/clubdrugs |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329215407/https://www.fbi.gov/scams-safety/clubdrugs |archivedate=29 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AdlafSmart1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adlaf|first1=Edward M.|last2=Smart|first2=Reginald G.|title=Party Subculture or Dens of Doom?

"[[Poppers]]" is the street name for [[alkyl nitrites]] (the most well-known being [[amyl nitrite]]), which are inhaled for their intoxicating effects, notably the "rush" or "high" they can provide. Nitrites originally came as small glass capsules that were popped open, which led to the nickname "poppers." The drug became popular in the US first on the disco/club scene of the 1970s and then at dance and rave venues in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 2000s, synthetic [[phenethylamines]] such as [[2C-I]], [[2C-B]] and [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine|DOB]] have been referred to as club drugs due to their stimulating and psychedelic nature (and their chemical relationship with [[MDMA]]).&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.bbc.co.uk/onelife/drink_drugs/2ci/ BBC-2C-I]&lt;/ref&gt; By late 2012, derivates of the [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] 2C-X drugs, the [[NBOMe]]s and especially [[25I-NBOMe]], had become common at raves in Europe. In the U.S., some law enforcement agencies have branded the subculture as a [[Recreational drug use|drug-centric]] culture, as rave attendees have been known to use drugs such as [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[2CB]], and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Groups that have addressed alleged drug use at raves e.g. the Electronic Music Defense and Education Fund (EM:DEF), The Toronto Raver Info Project ([[Canada]]), [[DanceSafe]] ([[United States|USA]] and [[Canada]]), and [[Eve &amp; Rave]] ([[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]]), all of which advocate [[harm reduction]] approaches. In 2005, Antonio Maria Costa, Executive Director of the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], advocated drug testing on highways as a countermeasure against drug use at raves.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
Much of the controversy, [[moral panic]] and law enforcement attention directed at rave culture and its association with drug use may be due to reports of drug overdoses (particularly MDMA) at raves, concerts and festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Armenian, Mamantov, Tsutaoka, Gerona, Silman, Wu, Olson |title=Multiple MDMA (Ecstasy) Overdoses at a Rave Event-A Case Series |journal=Journal of Intensive Care Medicine |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=252–258 |year=2012 |url=http://jic.sagepub.com/content/28/4/252 |doi=10.1177/0885066612445982|pmid=22640978 |citeseerx=10.1.1.668.2071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History by country==

=== Canada ===
In 2001 Calgary, Alberta became the first major municipality in Canada to pass a bylaw with respect to raves. The intent of the bylaw was to ensure that raves would be safe for participants, and also not unduly disruptive to adjacent neighbourhoods. The bylaw was created in consultation with representatives from the municipality, the province of Alberta, and the rave community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Sylvia|date=2002|title=Raves reviewed: An extended dance event bylaw|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.25316/IR-158|journal=Plan Canada|language=en|volume=42 | issue = 1 |pages=27–28|doi=10.25316/ir-158|issn=0032-0544|via=VIUSpace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1988, acid house was making as significant an impact on popular consciousness in Germany and Central Europe as it had in England.&lt;ref&gt;Short [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpC0qlWKb_Q excerpt] from special on German "Tele 5" from Dec.8, 1988. The show is called "Tanzhouse" hosted by a young Fred Kogel. It includes footage from Hamburg's "Front" with Boris Dlugosch, Kemal Kurum's "Opera House" and the "Prinzenbar".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 German DJs [[Westbam]] and Dr. Motte established the [[Ufo (Club, Berlin)|Ufo Club]], an illegal party venue, and co-founded the [[Love Parade]].&lt;ref name=ROBB&gt;Robb, D.

(1998), ''Eierkuchensozialismus'', TAZ, 10.7.1998, (p. 26).&lt;/ref&gt; In urbanized Germany raves and techno parties often preferred industrial sceneries such as decommissioned power stations, factories, the canalization or former military properties of the cold war.&lt;ref name="illegalraves"&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth: Love and Cabbage|url=http://magazin.spiegel.de/EpubDelivery/spiegel/pdf/9085950 | publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|date= 26 August 1996|accessdate=25 February 2017| language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 a number of party venues closed, including [[Ufo (Club, Berlin)|Ufo]], and the Berlin Techno scene centred itself around three locations close to the foundations of the Berlin Wall: the [[E-Werk]], the [[Bunker (Berlin)|Bunker]] and the now legendary [[Tresor (club)|Tresor]].&lt;ref&gt;Henkel, O.; Wolff, K. (1996) ''Berlin Underground: Techno und Hiphop; Zwischen Mythos und Ausverkauf'', Berlin: FAB Verlag, (pp. 81–83).&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, German DJs began intensifying the speed and abrasiveness of the sound, as an acid-infused techno began transmuting into [[hardcore techno|hardcore]].&lt;ref&gt;Schuler, M. (1995), "Gabber + Hardcore" (p. 123), in Anz, P.; Walder, P. (eds.) (1999 rev. edn, 1st publ. 1995, Zurich: Verlag Ricco Bilger) ''Techno''. Reinbek: Rowohlt Taschenbuch Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; This emerging sound was influenced by Dutch [[gabber]] and Belgian hardcore. Other influences on the development of this style were European [[Electronic Body Music]] groups of the mid-1980s such as [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft|DAF]], [[Front 242]], and [[Nitzer Ebb]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, S. (1998), ''Energy Flash: a Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture'', Pan Macmillan, (p. 110).&lt;/ref&gt;

Across Europe, rave culture was becoming part of a new youth movement. DJs and electronic-music producers such as Westbam proclaimed the existence of a "raving society" and promoted [[electronic music]] as legitimate competition for [[rock and roll]]. Indeed, [[electronic dance music]] and rave subculture became mass movements. Since the mid 1990s, raves had tens of thousands of attendees, youth magazines featured styling tips, and television networks launched music magazines on House and Techno music.&lt;ref name="technoculture"&gt;{{cite web|title=Young is the Night: Nightlife from A to Z |url=http://magazin.spiegel.de/EpubDelivery/spiegel/pdf/7441075 | publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|date= 1 August 1998|accessdate=25 February 2017| language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="munichfoundcom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Corpus Techno: The music of the future will soon be history |url=http://www.munichfound.com/archives/id/27/article/496/|publisher=MUNICHfound.com|date=July 1997|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual [[Love Parade]] festivals in Berlin and later the Metropolitan Ruhr area repeatedly attracted more than one million party-goers between 1997 and 2010. Dozens of other annual [[technoparade]]s took place in Germany and Central Europe at that time, the largest ones being [[Union Move]], Generation Move, Reincarnation and Vision Parade as well as [[Street Parade]] and [[Lake Parade]] in Switzerland. Large commercial raves since the nineties include [[Mayday (music festival)|Mayday]], [[Nature One]], [[Time Warp Festival|Time Warp]], [[SonneMondSterne]] and [[Melt! Festival|Melt!]]. Beyond Berlin, further centers of the techno and rave scene of the 1990s and 2000s in Germany were Frankfurt (famous clubs were ''Omen'', ''[[Dorian Gray (club)|Dorian Gray]]'', ''[[Cocoon (club)|Cocoon]]'' and ''U60311'') and Munich (''Ultraschall'', ''KW – Das Heizkraftwerk'', ''Natraj Temple'', ''Harry Klein'' and ''Rote Sonne'').&lt;ref name="ronaldhitzler"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hitzler |first1=Ronald |last2=Pfadenhauer |first2=Michaela |last3=Hillebrandt |first3=Frank |last4=Kneer |first4=Georg | last5=Kraemer|first5=Klaus | title=Loss of safety?

Further popular venues include ''Stammheim (Aufschwung Ost)'' in Kassel, ''Tunnel Club'' in Hamburg and ''Distillery'' in Leipzig. Since the late 2000s, Berlin is still called the capital of electro music and rave, and techno clubs such as [[Berghain]], [[Tresor (club)|Tresor]], ''Watergate'' or [[KitKatClub]] and the way to party in barely renovated venues, ruins or wooden shacks such as, among many others, [[Club der Visionaere]], ''Wilde Renate'', ''Fiese Remise'' or ''Bar 25'', attracted international media attention.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|title=In Berlin, Still Partying in the Ruins |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/travel/in-berlin-still-partying-in-the-ruins.html?_r=0|publisher=New York Times|date=21 November 2014|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One movie that portraits this scene of the 2000s is [[Berlin Calling]] starring Paul Kalkbrenner. In the 2010s, there remains a vivid rave and techno scene throughout the country, including numerous festivals and world-class techno clubs also outside of Berlin, such as for example ''MMA Club (Mixed Munich Arts)'' in Munich, ''Institut für Zukunft'' in Leipzig or ''Robert Johnson'' in Offenbach.&lt;ref name=" electronicbeats"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.electronicbeats.net/10-best-clubs-germany-arent-berlin/ |title= The 10 best clubs in Germany that aren’t in Berlin | publisher=[[Electronic Beats]] |date=30 January 2017 |accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====Birth of UK rave scene (1980s–1990s)====
{{See also|Second Summer of Love|Acid house party}}
The UK was finally recognized for its rave culture in the late 1980s and early 1990s. By 1991, organisations such as [[Fantazia (dance)|Fantazia]] and [[Raindance (rave)|Raindance]]  were holding massive legal raves in fields and warehouses around the country. The Fantazia party at Castle Donington, July 1992 was an open-air, all-night event.  The Vision at Pophams airfield in August 1992 and Universe's [[Tribal Gathering]] in 1993 had a more festival feel.

By the middle of 1992, the scene was slowly changing, with local councils passing by-laws and increasing fees in an effort to prevent or discourage rave organisations from acquiring necessary licences.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} This meant that the days of the large one-off parties were numbered. By the mid-1990s, the scene had also fragmented into many different styles of dance music, making large parties more expensive to set up and more difficult to promote. The sound driving the big raves of the early 1990s had by the end of 1993 split into two distinct and polarising styles, the darker [[oldschool jungle|jungle]] and the faster [[happy hardcore]]. Although many ravers left the scene due to the split, promoters such as ESP Dreamscape and [[Helter Skelter (rave music promoter)|Helter Skelter]] still enjoyed widespread popularity and capacity attendances with multi-arena events catering to the various genres. Notable events of this period included ESP's outdoor Dreamscape 20 event on 9 September 1995 at Brafield aerodrome fields, [[Northamptonshire|Northants]] and Helter Skelter's Energy 97 outdoor event on 9th Aug 1997 at Turweston Aerodrome, Northants.

====Free parties and outlawing of raves (1992–1994)====
{{See also|Free party}}
The illegal [[free party]] scene also reached its zenith for that time after a particularly large festival, when many individual sound systems such as Bedlam, Circus Warp, DIY, and [[Spiral Tribe]] set up near [[Castlemorton Common Festival|Castlemorton]] Common. The government acted. Under the ''[[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]'', the definition of music played at a rave was given as:

{{quote|"Music" includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats.|Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1994/ukpga_19940033_en_8#pt5-pb2 |title=Public Order: Collective Trespass or Nuisance on Land – Powers to remove trespassers on land – Powers to remove persons attending or preparing for a rave |work=Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 |publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]] |accessdate=9 June 2008| year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sections 63, 64 &amp; 65 of the Act targeted [[electronic dance music]] played at raves. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act empowered police to stop a rave in the open air when a hundred or more people are attending, or where two or more are making preparations for a rave. Section 65 allows any uniformed constable who believes a person is on their way to a rave within a five-mile radius to stop them and direct them away from the area; non-compliant citizens may be subject to a maximum fine not exceeding level 3 on the [[standard scale]] (£1000). The Act was officially introduced because of the noise and disruption caused by all night parties to nearby residents, and to protect the countryside. However, some participants in the scene claimed it was an attempt to lure youth culture away from MDMA and back to taxable [[alcohol]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon Reynolds, ''Energy Flash: A Journey through Rave Music and Dance Culture'', Pan Macmillan, (p. 149) ({{ISBN|0330350560}})&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1994, the Zippies staged an act of [[Intervasion of the UK|electronic civil disobedience]] to protest against the CJB (i.e., [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994|Criminal Justice Bill]]).

====Legal and underground raves (1994–present)====
After 1993, the main outlet for raves in the UK were a number of licensed parties, amongst them [[Helter Skelter (rave music promoter)|Helter Skelter]], Life at Bowlers (Trafford Park, Manchester), The Edge (formerly the Eclipse [Coventry]), The Sanctuary (Milton Keynes) and Club Kinetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

"The Laser Dome" featured two separate dance areas, "Hardcore" and "Garage", as well as over 20 video game machines, a silent-movie screening lounge, replicas of the "Statue of Liberty", "San Francisco Bridge", and a large glass maze. In Scotland, event promoters Rezerection held large-scale events across the country.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

By 1997, the popularity of weekly Superclub nights had taken over from the old Rave format, with a raft of new club-based genres sweeping in (e.g. Trance, Hard House, Speed and UK garage) alongside the more traditional House sound that had regained popularity.  Clubs like Gatecrasher and Cream rose to prominence with dress codes and door policies that were the polar opposite of their rave counterparts; stories of refused entry due to not wearing the right clothing were commonplace, but seemingly did nothing to deter Superclub attendance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Origins in disco and psychedelia (1970s)====
{{See also|Circuit party}}
American ravers, following their early UK &amp; European counterparts, have been compared to the hippies of the 1960s due to their shared interest in non-violence and psychedelia.&lt;ref&gt;Energy Flash, Simon Reynolds, (p276 &amp; 290), 1998, Macmillan Publishers ({{ISBN|0330350560}})&lt;/ref&gt; Rave culture incorporated disco culture's same love of dance music spun by DJs, drug exploration, sexual promiscuity, and hedonism. Although disco culture had thrived in the mainstream, the rave culture would make an effort to stay underground to avoid the animosity that was still surrounding disco and dance music. The key motive for remaining underground in many parts of the US had to do with curfew and the standard 2:00 am closing of clubs. It was a desire to keep the party going past legal hours that created the underground direction. Because of the legality, they had to be secretive about time and place.

====New York raves and party promoters (1980s)====
In the late 1980s, rave culture began to filter through into North America from English expatriates and from US DJs who would visit Europe. However, rave culture's major expansion in North America is often credited to [[Frankie Bones]], who after spinning a party in an aircraft hangar in England, helped organize some of the earliest American raves in the 1990s in New York City called "Storm Raves". Storm Raves had a consistent core audience, fostered  by zines by fellow Storm DJ (and co-founder, with Adam X and Frankie Bones, of the US techno record store, Groove Records.). [[Heather Heart]] held Under One Sky. Simultaneously in NYC, events were introducing electronic dance music to this city's dance scene. Between 1992 and 1994, promotional groups sprung up across the east coast.

====San Diego and Latin America (1990s)====
In the 1990s, San Diego held large raves with audiences of thousands. These festivals were  held on Indian reservations and ski resorts during the summer months and were headlined by DJs such as Doc Martin, Dimitri of [[Deee-lite]], Afrika Islam and the [[Hardkiss]] brothers from San Francisco. They helped to create the Right to Dance movement—a non violent protest held in San Diego and later in Los Angeles.

Featuring local San Diego DJs Jon Bishop, Steve Pagan, Alien Tom, Jeff Skot and Mark E. Quark performed at these events. The events used large props and themes. The fairy and pixie craze, with ravers getting fairy tattoos and wearing fairy wings to parties was associated with the region. The percussive group [[Crash Worship]] was active here.

====Growth in California====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a boom in rave culture in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. At first, small underground parties sprung up all over the [[South of Market, San Francisco|SOMA]] district in vacant warehouses, loft spaces, and clubs. The no alcohol rule fueled the ecstasy-driven parties. Small underground raves were just starting out and expanding beyond SF to include the East Bay, the South Bay area including San Jose, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz beaches.

In late 1991, raves started to expand across northern California, and cities like Sacramento, Oakland, Silicon Valley (Palo Alto, San Jose). The massive parties were taking place in outdoor fields, airplane hangars and hilltops that surround the valley. San Francisco's early promoters and DJs were from the UK and Europe. Raves took place in some of the SOMA art museum event such as, 'Where the wild things are' in the museum on top of the Sony Metreon, and in the Maritime hall (1998–2002).

By the end of 1994, a new generation of ravers were attracted by the new sounds. EDM began to become popular. Raves could be found in many different kinds of venues, as opposed to just basements and warehouses. Promoters started to take notice and put together the massives of the late 1990s with many music forms under one roof for 12-hour events. 2000 saw the demise of massive raves as curfews were placed on permits handed out to promoters. Instead of all night and into the next day, parties now had to end at 2 a.m.  Smaller, intimate venues continued just like they had from the start and underground raves became the norm. The [[Electric Daisy Carnival#2010|death of an attendee who had taken MDMA]] at the [[Electric Daisy Carnival]] in 2010 put a negative spin on raves in LA and California.

====Seattle====
Through the mid 1990s and into the 2000s the city of Seattle also shared in the tradition of West Coast rave culture. Though a smaller scene compared to San Francisco, Seattle also had many different rave crews, promoters, Djs, and fans. Candy Raver style, friendship and culture became popular in the West Coast rave scene, both in Seattle and San Francisco. At the peak of West Coast rave, Candy Raver, and massive rave popularity (1996–1999,) it was common to meet groups of ravers, promoters, and Djs who frequently travelled between Seattle and San Francisco, which spread the overall sense of West Coast rave culture and the phenomenon of West Coast "massives".

====Recent years (2000s)====
{{See also|List of electronic dance music festivals}}
By 2010, raves were becoming the equivalent of large-scale rock music festivals, but many times even bigger and more profitable. The [[Electric Daisy Carnival]] in Las Vegas drew more than 300,000 fans over three days in the summer of 2012, making it the largest EDM music festival in North America. [[Ultra Music Festival]] in Miami drew 150,000 fans over three days in 2012 while other raves like [[Electric Zoo]] in New York, [[Beyond Wonderland]] in LA, Movement in Detroit, [[Electric Forest]] in Michigan, Spring Awakening in Chicago, and dozens more now attract hundreds of thousands of "ravers" every year. These new EDM-based rave events (now simply referred generically to as "[[music festivals]]") sell out. Festival attendance at the Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) increased by 39.1%, or 90,000 attendees from 2011 to 2012. In 2013, EDC had attendance of approximately 345,000 people, a record for the festival. The average ticket for EDC cost over $300 and the event contributed $278 million to the Clark County economy in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w.insomniac.com/newsDetails.php?news=607 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150121204609/http://w.insomniac.com/newsDetails.php?news=607 |archivedate=21 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This festival takes place at a 1,000-acre complex featuring a half dozen custom built stages, enormous interactive art installations, and hundreds of EDM artists.

====1980s and 1990s: outdoor raves and the Sydney scene====
Rave parties began in Australia as early as the 1980s and continued well into the late 1990s. They were mobilised versions of the 'warehouse parties', across Britain. Similar to the United States and Britain, raves in Australia were unlicensed and held in spaces normally used for industrial and manufacturing purposes, such as [[warehouses]], [[factories]] and carpet showrooms. In addition, suburban locations were also used: basketball gymnasiums, train stations and even circus tents were all common venues. In [[Sydney]], common areas used for outdoor events included [[Sydney Park]], a reclaimed garbage dump in the inner south west of the city, Cataract Park and various other natural, unused locations and bush lands. The raves placed a heavy emphasis on the connection between humans and the natural environment, thus many raves in Sydney were held outdoors, notably the 'Happy Valley' parties (1991–1994), 'Ecology' (1992) and 'Field of Dreams 4' (July 6, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.snarl.org/youth/chrispagan2.pdf|title=Rave culture in Sydney, Australia: mapping youth spaces in media discourse|first=Chris|last=Pagan|publisher=[[University of Sydney]]|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sydneyravehistory.com/#!rave-timeline/c66t|title = Timeline of Sydney Raves from the website – Sydney Rave History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mid-late 1990s saw a slight decline in rave attendance, attributed to the [[Anna Wood (born 1980)|death of Anna Wood]] at a licensed inner-city Sydney venue, which was hosting a rave party known as "Apache". Wood had taken [[MDMA|ecstasy]] and died in hospital a few days later, leading to extensive media exposure on the correlation of drug culture and its links to the rave scene in Australia.

====2000s&amp;ndash;present====
The tradition continued in [[Melbourne]], with 'Earthcore' parties. Raves also became less underground as they were in the 1990s, and many were held at licensed venues well into the 2000s. Despite this, rave parties of 1990s size became less common. Nonetheless, the rave scene in Australia experienced a resurgence after 2010. During this period the resurfacing of the "Melbourne Shuffle", a Melbourne club/rave dance style, became a YouTube trend and  videos were uploaded. The rave subculture in Melbourne was strengthened with the opening of clubs such as Bass Station and Hard Candy and the rise of [[free party]] groups such as Melbourne Underground. Melbourne helped keep raving culture alive with young people.

'''Reaction bonded silicon carbide''', also known as '''siliconized silicon carbide''' or '''SiSiC''', is a type of [[silicon carbide]] that is manufactured by a [[chemical reaction]] between [[porous]] [[carbon]] or [[graphite]] with molten [[silicon]]. Due to the left over traces of silicon, reaction bonded silicon carbide is often referred to as siliconized silicon carbide, or its abbreviation SiSiC.

If pure silicon carbide is produced by [[sintering]] of silicon carbide powder, it usually contains traces of chemicals called ''sintering aids'', which are added to support the sintering process by allowing lower sintering temperatures. This type of silicon carbide is often referred to as ''sintered silicon carbide'', or abbreviated to SSiC.

The silicon carbide powder is gained from silicon carbide produced as described in the article [[silicon carbide]].

[[File:Punch.jpg|thumb|1867 edition of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', a ground-breaking [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] magazine of popular humour, including a great deal of satire of the contemporary, social, and political scene.]] {{Literature}}{{Performing arts}}
'''Satire''' is a [[genre]] of [[literature]], and sometimes [[graphic arts|graphic]] and [[performing art]]s, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement.{{Sfn | Elliott | 2004}} Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive [[social criticism]], using [[wit]] to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society.

A feature of satire is strong [[irony]] or [[sarcasm]]—"in satire, irony is militant"{{Refn | {{Citation | author-link = Northrop Frye | first = Northrop | last = Frye | title = quote}}{{Sfn | Elliott | 2004}} (literary critic).}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anatomy of Criticism|last=Frye|first=Northrup|publisher=Princeton UP|year=1957|isbn=0-691-06004-5|location=Princeton|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;—but [[parody]], [[burlesque (literary)|burlesque]], [[exaggeration]],&lt;ref name="Claridge2010p257"/&gt; juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and [[double entendre]] are all frequently used in satirical speech and writing. This "militant" irony or sarcasm often professes to approve of (or at least accept as natural) the very things the satirist wishes to attack.

Satire is nowadays found in many artistic forms of expression, including [[internet meme]]s, literature, plays, commentary, television shows, and media such as lyrics.

==Etymology and roots ==

The word satire comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''satur'' and the subsequent phrase ''[[wikt:satura#Latin|lanx satura]].'' ''Satur'' meant "full" but the juxtaposition with ''lanx'' shifted the meaning to "miscellany or medley": the expression ''lanx satura'' literally means "a full dish of various kinds of fruits".&lt;ref name="Kharpertian"&gt;{{Citation | first = Theodore D | last = Kharpertian | contribution = Thomas Pynchon and Postmodern American Satire | pages = 25–7 | editor-last = Kharpertian | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=um0h0arlUdoC | title = A hand to turn the time: the Menippean satires of Thomas Pynchon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''satura'' as used by [[Quintilian]], however, was used to denote only Roman verse satire, a strict genre that imposed [[hexameter]] form, a narrower genre than what would be later intended as ''satire''.&lt;ref name="Kharpertian" /&gt;{{Sfn | Branham | 1997 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=XrNEns3_yd0C&amp;pg=PR24 xxiv]}} Quintilian famously said that ''satura,'' that is a satire in hexameter verses, was a literary genre of wholly Roman origin (''satura tota nostra est''). He was aware of and commented on Greek satire, but at the time did not label it as such, although today the origin of satire is considered to be [[Aristophanes' Old Comedy]]. The first critic to use the term "satire" in the modern broader sense was [[Apuleius]].&lt;ref name="Kharpertian"/&gt;

To Quintilian, the satire was a strict literary form, but the term soon escaped from the original narrow definition. Robert Elliott writes:
{{quote | As soon as a noun enters the domain of metaphor, as one modern scholar has pointed out, it clamours for extension; and satura (which had had no verbal, adverbial, or adjectival forms) was immediately broadened by appropriation from the Greek word for “satyr” (satyros) and its derivatives. The odd result is that the English “satire” comes from the Latin satura; but "satirize", "satiric", etc., are of Greek origin. By about the 4th century AD the writer of satires came to be known as satyricus; St. Jerome, for example, was called by one of his enemies 'a satirist in prose' ('satyricus scriptor in prosa').  Subsequent orthographic modifications obscured the Latin origin of the word satire: satura becomes satyra, and in England, by the 16th century, it was written 'satyre.'{{Sfn | Elliott | 2004}}}}

The word ''satire'' derives from ''satura'', and its origin was not influenced by the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] figure of the ''[[satyr]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = The [[Renaissance]] confusion of the two origins encouraged a satire more aggressive than that of its Roman forebearers | first = BL | last = Ullman | title = Satura and Satire | journal = Classical Philology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | year = 1913 | jstor = 262450 | doi = 10.1086/359771 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, philologist [[Isaac Casaubon]] was the first to dispute the etymology of satire from satyr, contrary to the belief up to that time.&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Szabari (2009) ''Less Rightly Said: Scandals and Readers in Sixteenth-Century France'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=3-QJLqEwvb0C&amp;pg=PA2 p.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humour==
{{rquote|right|The rules of satire are such that it must do more than make you laugh. No matter how amusing it is, it doesn't count unless you find yourself wincing a little even as you chuckle.&lt;ref name="galaxy196806"&gt;{{Cite magazine

[[Laughter]] is not an essential component of satire;{{Sfn | Corum | 2002 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=ikGt9gkXv74C&amp;pg=PA175 175]}} in fact there are types of satire that are not meant to be "funny" at all. Conversely, not all humour, even on such topics as politics, religion or art is necessarily "satirical", even when it uses the satirical tools of irony, parody, and [[burlesque]].

Even light-hearted satire has a serious "after-taste": the organizers of the [[Ig Nobel Prize]] describe this as "first make people laugh, and then make them think".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://improbable.com/ig/ | title = Improbable | contribution = Ig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and psychological functions==
Satire and [[irony]] in some cases have been regarded as the most effective source to understand a society, the oldest form of [[social study]].&lt;ref name="Rosenberg1960p155"/&gt; They provide the keenest insights into a group's [[Collective unconscious|collective psyche]], reveal its deepest values and tastes, and the society's structures of power.&lt;ref name="Deloria69p146"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nash1970p203"/&gt; Some authors have regarded satire as superior to non-comic and non-artistic disciplines like history or [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name="Rosenberg1960p155"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Babcock1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coppola"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Jo | last = Coppola | title = Comedy on Television | publisher = Commonweal | date = 12 December 1958 | page = 288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a prominent example from [[ancient Greece]], philosopher [[Plato]], when asked by a friend for a book to understand Athenian society, referred him to the plays of [[Aristophanes]].&lt;ref name="Willi2003p1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ehrenberg1962p39"/&gt;

Historically, satire has satisfied the popular [[need]] to [[debunk]] and [[Ridiculous|ridicule]] the leading figures in politics, economy, religion and other prominent realms of [[Power (social and political)|power]].&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt; Satire confronts [[public discourse]] and the [[collective imaginary]], playing as a public opinion counterweight to power (be it political, economic, religious, symbolic, or otherwise), by challenging leaders and authorities. For instance, it forces administrations to clarify, amend or establish their policies. Satire's job is to expose problems and contradictions, and it's not obligated to solve them.&lt;ref name="WieseForbes2010p.xv"/&gt; [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] set in the history of satire a prominent example of a satirist role as confronting public discourse.&lt;ref name="Knight2004p254"/&gt;

For its nature and social role, satire has enjoyed in many societies a special freedom license to mock prominent individuals and institutions.&lt;ref name="Test1991p9licencequote"/&gt; The satiric impulse, and its ritualized expressions, carry out the function of resolving social tension.&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; Institutions like the [[ritual clown]]s, by giving expression to the [[antisocial tendencies]], represent a [[safety valve]] which re-establishes equilibrium and health in the [[collective imaginary]], which are jeopardized by the [[Social repression|repressive aspects of society]].&lt;ref name="Cazeneuve1957p244"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Durand1984p106"/&gt;

The state of [[political satire]] in a given society reflects the tolerance or intolerance that characterizes it,&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt; and the state of [[civil liberties]] and [[human rights]]. Under [[totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] any criticism of a political system, and especially satire, is suppressed. A typical example is the [[Soviet Union]] where the [[dissidents]], such as [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Andrei Sakharov]] were under strong pressure from the government. While satire of everyday life in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] was allowed, the most prominent satirist being [[Arkady Raikin]], political satire existed in the form of [[anecdote]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://samlib.ru/j/jacko_w_a/anecdotes.shtml | last = Yatsko | first = V | title = Russian folk funny stories}}&lt;/ref&gt; that made fun of Soviet political leaders, especially [[Brezhnev]], famous for his narrow-mindedness and love for awards and decorations.

==Classifications==
Satire is a diverse genre which is complex to classify and define, with a wide range of satiric "modes".&lt;ref&gt;Corum (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ikGt9gkXv74C&amp;pg=PA163 p.163]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Worcester (1968) [https://books.google.com/books?id=foUbAQAAIAAJ ''The Art of Satire''] p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horatian, Juvenalian, Menippean===
[[File:Satire (Orazio) - pag. 12.JPG|thumb|upright|&lt;center&gt;"Le satire e l'epistole di Q. Orazio Flacco", printed in 1814.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Satirical literature can commonly be categorized as either Horatian, Juvenalian, or [[Menippean satire|Menippean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Müller|first=Rolf Arnold|title=Komik und Satire|year=1973|publisher=Juris-Verlag|location=Zürich|isbn=978-3-260-03570-8 | language = German |page= 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Horatian====
Horatian satire, named for the Roman satirist [[Horace]] (65–8 BCE), playfully criticizes some social vice through gentle, mild, and light-hearted humour. Horace (Quintus Horatius Flaccus) wrote Satires to gently ridicule the dominant opinions and "philosophical beliefs of ancient Rome and Greece" (Rankin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-horatian-satire.htm|title=What Is Horatian Satire?|work=wiseGEEK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than writing in harsh or accusing tones, he addressed issues with humor and clever mockery. Horatian satire follows this same pattern of "gently [ridiculing] the absurdities and follies of human beings" (Drury).&lt;ref name=nku.edu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nku.edu/~rkdrury/422/satire_terms.html|title=Satire Terms|work=nku.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;It directs wit, exaggeration, and self-deprecating humour toward what it identifies as folly, rather than evil. Horatian satire's sympathetic tone is common in modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|  authorlink = Raja Sharma | first = Raja | last = Sharma | title = [["Comedy" in New Light-Literary Studies]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;A Horatian satirist's goal is to heal the situation with smiles, rather than by anger. Horatian satire is a gentle reminder to take life less seriously and evokes a wry smile.&lt;ref name=nku.edu/&gt; A Horatian satirist makes fun of general human folly rather than engaging in specific or personal attacks. Shamekia Thomas suggests, "In a work using Horatian satire, readers often laugh at the characters in the story who are the subject of mockery as well as themselves and society for behaving in those ways." [[Alexander Pope]] has been established as an author whose satire "heals with morals what it hurts with wit" (Green).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/honors/Programs-Minors/honors-and-the-schools/houston-teachers-institute/curriculum-units/pdfs/2008/comedy/green-08-comedy.pdf|title=The Golden Age of Satire: Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift|author=Patricia, Green}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Pope—and Horatian satire—attempt to teach.

====Juvenalian====
{{See also|Satires of Juvenal}}
Juvenalian satire, named for the writings of the Roman satirist [[Juvenal]] (late first century – early second century AD), is more contemptuous and abrasive than the Horatian. Juvenal disagreed with the opinions of the public figures and institutions of the Republic and actively attacked them through his literature. "He utilized the satirical tools of exaggeration and parody to make his targets appear monstrous and incompetent" (Podzemny).&lt;ref name="wisegeek.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-juvenalian-satire.htm|title=What Is Juvenalian Satire?|work=wiseGEEK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenal satire follows this same pattern of abrasively ridiculing societal structures. Juvenal also, unlike Horace, attacked public officials and governmental organizations through his satires, regarding their opinions as not just wrong, but evil.

Following in this tradition, Juvenalian satire addresses perceived social evil through scorn, outrage, and savage ridicule. This form is often pessimistic, characterized by the use of irony, sarcasm, moral indignation and personal invective, with less emphasis on humor. Strongly polarized political satire can often be classified as Juvenalian.&lt;br /&gt;A Juvenal satirist's goal is generally to provoke some sort of political or societal change because he sees his opponent or object as evil or harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.literarydevices.com/satire/|title=Satire Examples and Definition|work=Literary Devices}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Juvenal satirist mocks "societal structure, power, and civilization" (Thomas)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education-portal.com/academy/lesson/satire-in-literature-definition-types-examples.html|title=Satire in Literature: Definition, Types &amp; Examples|work=Education Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt; by exaggerating the words or position of his opponent in order to jeopardize their opponent's reputation and/or power. [[Jonathan Swift]] has been established as an author who "borrowed heavily from Juvenal's techniques in [his critique] of contemporary English society" (Podzemny).&lt;ref name="wisegeek.com" /&gt;

===Satire versus teasing===
In the [[history of theatre]] there has always been a conflict between engagement and disengagement on [[politics]] and relevant issue, between satire and [[grotesque]] on one side, and [[jest]] with [[teasing]] on the other.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p9"/&gt; [[Max Eastman]] defined the [[spectrum]] of satire in terms of "degrees of biting", as ranging from satire proper at the hot-end, and "kidding" at the violet-end; Eastman adopted the term kidding to denote what is just satirical in form, but is not really firing at the target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Max Eastman | first = Max | last = Eastman | year = 1936 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Tyd5wwn8acwC&amp;pg=PA236 | title = Enjoyment of Laughter | chapter = IV. Degrees of Biting | pages = 236–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate]] satirical playwright [[Dario Fo]] pointed out the difference between satire and teasing (''sfottò'').&lt;ref name="Lorch1997p128"&gt;{{Citation | author1-link = Dario Fo | first1 = Dario | last1 = Fo | first2 = Jennifer | last2 = Lorch | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u12fXi_HDO4C&amp;pg=PA128 | title = Dario Fo | page = 128 | quote = In other writings Fo makes an important distinction between ''sfottò'' and satire.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teasing is the [[reactionary]] side of the [[comic]]; it limits itself to a shallow [[parody]] of physical appearance. The side-effect of teasing is that it humanizes and draws sympathy for the powerful individual towards which it is directed. Satire instead uses the comic to go against power and its oppressions, has a [[subversive]] character, and a [[moral]] dimension which draws judgement against its targets.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fo1990pn" /&gt;{{Refn | name = "Arroyop303" | {{Citation | first1 = José Luís Blas | last1 = Arroyo | first2 = Mónica Velando | last2 = Casanova | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CxZ_zH44PVkC&amp;pg=PA303 | title = Discurso y sociedad: contribuciones al estudio de la lengua en... | volume = 1 | pages = 303–4}} }}&lt;ref name = "Morson1988p114"&gt;{{Citation | last = Morson | first = Gary Saul | year = 1988 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PpLiINhO83MC&amp;pg=PA114 | title = Boundaries of Genre | page = 114 | quote = second, that parodies can be, as Bakhtin observes, "shallow" as well as "deep" (''Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics'', 160), which is to say, directed at superficial as well as fundamental faults of the original. [...] the distinction between shallow and deep [...] [is] helpful in understanding the complex ways in which parodies are used. For instance, shallow parody is sometimes used to pay an author an indirect compliment. The opposite of damning with faint praise, this parody with faint criticism may be designed to show that no more fundamental criticism ''could'' be made.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fo formulated an [[Operational definition|operational]] criterion to tell real satire from ''sfottò'', saying that real satire arouses an outraged and violent reaction, and that the more they try to stop you, the better is the job you are doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Daniele Luttazzi | first = Daniele | last = Luttazzi | year = 2005 | url = http://news.danieleluttazzi.it/?q=node/147 | archivedate = December 25, 2005 | place = [[Italy|IT]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051225171452/http://news.danieleluttazzi.it/?q=node%2F147 | title = Matrix | quote = Dario Fo disse a Satyricon: —La satira vera si vede dalla reazione che suscita. | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fo contends that, historically, people in positions of power have welcomed and encouraged good-humoured buffoonery, while modern day people in positions of power have tried to censor, ostracize and repress satire.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fo1990p2"/&gt;

Teasing (''sfottò'') is an ancient form of simple [[buffoonery]], a form of comedy without satire's subversive edge. Teasing includes light and affectionate parody, good-humoured mockery, simple one-dimensional poking fun, and benign spoofs. Teasing typically consists of an [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impersonation]] of someone monkeying around with his exterior attributes, [[tic]]s, physical blemishes, voice and mannerisms, quirks, way of dressing and walking, and/or the phrases he typically repeats. By contrast, teasing never touches on the core issue, never makes a serious criticism judging the target with [[irony]]; it never harms the target's conduct, [[ideology]] and position of power; it never undermines the perception of his morality and cultural dimension.&lt;ref name="Fo1990p2"/&gt;{{Refn | name="Arroyop303"}} ''Sfottò'' directed towards a powerful individual makes him appear more human and draws sympathy towards him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Daniele Luttazzi | first = Daniele | last = Luttazzi | language = Italian | url = http://www.nazioneindiana.com/2003/10/28/state-a-casa-a-fare-i-compiti-2/ | title = State a casa a fare i compiti | format = interview | editor1-first = Federica | editor1-last = Fracassi | editor2-first = Jacopo | editor2-last = Guerriero | journal = Nazione Indiana |date=October 2003 | quote = Lo sfottò è reazionario.

===Classifications by topics===
Types of satire can also be classified according to the topics it deals with. From the earliest times, at least since the plays of [[Aristophanes]], the primary topics of literary satire have been [[politics]], [[religion]] and [[sex]].&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark73p20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark80p45"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferdie Addis (2012) ''Qual è il tuo "tallone da killer"?'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=kKysGIQV4SgC&amp;pg=PT20 p.20]&lt;/ref&gt; This is partly because these are the most pressing problems that affect anybody living in a society, and partly because these topics are usually [[taboo]].&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p33"/&gt; Among these, politics in the broader sense is considered the pre-eminent topic of satire.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p33"/&gt; Satire which targets the [[clergy]] is a type of [[political satire]], while [[religious satire]] is that which targets [[religious belief]]s.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p39"/&gt; Satire on sex may overlap with [[blue comedy]], [[off-color humor]] and [[dick joke]]s.

[[Scatology]] has a long literary association with satire,&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson2002pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anspaugh94"/&gt; as it is a classical mode of the [[grotesque]], the [[grotesque body]] and the satiric grotesque.&lt;ref name="Clark91p116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andries2000p10"/&gt; [[Shit]] plays a fundamental role in satire because it symbolizes [[death]], the turd being "the ultimate dead object".&lt;ref name="Wilson2002pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anspaugh94"/&gt; The satirical comparison of individuals or institutions with human [[excrement]], exposes their "inherent inertness, corruption and dead-likeness".&lt;ref name="Wilson2002pp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein1993p20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duprat1982p178"/&gt; The [[ritual clown]]s of [[clown societies]], like among the [[Pueblo Indians]], have ceremonies with [[Coprophagia|filth-eating]].&lt;ref name="Parsons34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyers96"/&gt; In other cultures, [[sin-eating]] is an [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] rite in which the sin-eater (also called filth-eater),&lt;ref&gt;Donald Alexander Mackenzie (1923) ''Myths of Pre-Columbian America'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=6chKHROa1icC&amp;pg=PA229 p.229]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Marnham (2000) ''Dreaming with His Eyes Open: A Life of Diego Rivera'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=pcddElQo9JkC&amp;pg=PA297 p.297]&lt;/ref&gt; by ingesting the food provided, takes "upon himself the sins of the departed".&lt;ref name="Davidson 1993p85"/&gt; Satire about death overlaps with [[black humor]] and [[gallows humor]].

Another classification by topics is the distinction between political satire, religious satire and satire of manners.&lt;ref name="Bloom1979"/&gt; Political satire is sometimes called topical satire, satire of manners is sometimes called satire of everyday life, and religious satire is sometimes called philosophical satire. [[Comedy of manners]], sometimes also called satire of manners, criticizes mode of life of common people; political satire aims at behavior, manners of politicians, and vices of political systems. Historically, comedy of manners, which first appeared in British theater in 1620, has uncritically accepted the social code of the upper classes.&lt;ref name="Nicoll1951p179"/&gt; Comedy in general accepts the rules of the social game, while satire subverts them.&lt;ref name="Hodgart2009p189"/&gt;

Another analysis of satire is the spectrum of his possible [[Tone (literature)|tone]]s: [[wit]], [[ridicule]], [[irony]], [[sarcasm]], [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynicism]], the [[sardonic]] and [[invective]].&lt;ref name="Pollard1970p66"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark1946p32"/&gt;

===Classifications by medium===
Satire is found not only in written literary forms. In [[preliterate culture]]s it manifests itself in [[ritual clown|ritual]] and folk forms, as well as in [[trickster]] tales and [[oral poetry]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt;

It appears also in graphic arts, music, sculpture, dance, [[cartoon strip]]s, and [[graffiti]]. Examples are [[Dada]] sculptures, [[Pop Art]] works, music of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and [[Erik Satie]], [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[rock music]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; In modern [[media culture]], [[stand-up comedy]] is an enclave in which satire can be introduced into [[mass media]], challenging [[mainstream]] discourse.&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; [[Roast (comedy)|Comedy roast]]s, mock festivals, and stand-up comedians in nightclubs and concerts are the modern forms of ancient satiric rituals.&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt;

[[File:WLA brooklynmuseum Figured Ostracon Showing a Cat Waiting on a Mouse.jpg|thumb|Figured ostracon showing a cat waiting on a mouse, Egypt]]
One of the earliest examples of what we might call satire, [[The Satire of the Trades]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = M | last = Lichtheim | title = Ancient Egyptian Literature | volume = I | year = 1973 | pages = 184–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; is in Egyptian writing from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. The text's apparent readers are students, tired of studying. It argues that their lot as scribes is not only useful, but far superior to that of the ordinary man. Scholars such as Helck&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = W | last = Helck | title = Die Lehre des DwA-xtjj | publisher = Wiesbaden | year = 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; think that the context was meant to be serious.

The [[Papyrus Anastasi I]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Alan H | last = Gardiner | title = Egyptian Hieratic Texts | series= I: Literary Texts of the New Kingdom | volume = I | place = Leipzig | year = 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; (late 2nd millennium BC) contains a satirical letter which first praises the virtues of its recipient, but then mocks the reader's meagre knowledge and achievements.

===Ancient Greece===
The Greeks had no word for what later would be called "satire", although the terms cynicism and parody were used. Modern critics call the [[Greek comedy|Greek playwright]] [[Aristophanes]] one of the best known early satirists: his plays are known for their critical political and [[societal commentary]],&lt;ref name="Sutton, D. F. 1993 p.56"&gt;{{Citation | last = Sutton | first = DF | title = Ancient Comedy: The War of the Generations | place = New York | year = 1993 | page = 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly for the [[political satire]] by which he criticized the powerful [[Cleon]] (as in ''[[The Knights]]''). He is also notable for the persecution he underwent.&lt;ref name="Sutton, D. F. 1993 p.56" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.theatrehistory.com/ancient/aristophanes003.html | chapter = Political and social satires of Aristophanes | editor-first = Alfred | editor-last = Bates | title = The Drama, Its History, Literature and Influence on Civilization | volume = 2 | place = London | publisher = Historical Publishing | year = 1906 | pages = 55–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = JE | last = Atkinson | jstor = 639144 | title = Curbing the Comedians: Cleon versus Aristophanes and Syracosius' Decree | journal = The Classical Quarterly | series = New | volume = 42 | number = 1 | year = 1992 | pages = 56–64 | doi=10.1017/s0009838800042580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0714-06.htm | title = Aristophanes: the Michael Moore of his Day | first = John Louis | last = Anderson | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061019054115/http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0714-06.htm | archivedate = October 19, 2006 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristophanes' plays turned upon images of filth and disease.{{Sfn | Wilson | 2002 | p = 17}} His bawdy style was adopted by Greek dramatist-comedian [[Menander]]. His early play ''Drunkenness'' contains an attack on the politician [[Callimedon]].

The oldest form of satire still in use is the [[Menippean satire]] by [[Menippus|Menippus of Gadara]]. His own writings are lost. Examples from his admirers and imitators mix seriousness and mockery in dialogues and present parodies before a background of [[wikt:diatribe|diatribe]]. As in the case of Aristophanes plays, menippean satire turned upon images of filth and disease.{{Sfn | Wilson | 2002 | p = 17}}

===Roman world===
The first Roman to discuss satire critically was [[Quintilian]], who invented the term to describe the writings of [[Gaius Lucilius]]. The two most prominent and influential ancient Roman satirists are [[Horace]] and [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]], who wrote during the early days of the [[Roman Empire]]. Other important satirists in ancient [[Latin]] are Gaius Lucilius and [[Persius]]. ''Satire'' in their work is much wider than in the modern sense of the word, including fantastic and highly coloured humorous writing with little or no real mocking intent. When Horace criticized [[Augustus]], he used [[veil]]ed ironic terms. In contrast, [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] reports that the 6th-century-BC poet [[Hipponax]] wrote ''satirae'' that were so cruel that the offended hanged themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cuddon | title = Dictionary of Literary Terms | place = Oxford | year = 1998 | contribution = Satire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2nd century AD, [[Lucian]] wrote ''[[True History]]'', a book satirizing the clearly unrealistic travelogues/adventures written by [[Ctesias]], [[Iambulus]], and [[Homer]]. He states that he was surprised they expected people to believe their lies, and stating that he, like they, has no actual knowledge or experience, but shall now tell lies as if he did. He goes on to describe a far more obviously extreme and unrealistic tale, involving interplanetary exploration, war among alien life forms, and life inside a 200 mile long whale back in the terrestrial ocean, all intended to make obvious the fallacies of books like ''[[Indica (Ctesias)|Indica]]'' and ''[[The Odyssey]]''.

===Medieval Islamic world===
{{main|Arabic literature#Satire and comedy|Persian satire|l1=Arabic satire}}
Medieval [[Arabic poetry]] included the satiric genre ''hija''. Satire was introduced into [[Arabic literature|Arabic prose literature]] by the [[Afro-Arab]] author [[Al-Jahiz]] in the 9th century. While dealing with serious topics in what are now known as [[anthropology]], [[Sociology in medieval Islam|sociology]] and [[Psychology in medieval Islam|psychology]], he introduced a satirical approach, "based on the premise that, however serious the subject under review, it could be made more interesting and thus achieve greater effect, if only one leavened the lump of solemnity by the insertion of a few amusing anecdotes or by the throwing out of some witty or paradoxical observations. He was well aware that, in treating of new themes in his prose works, he would have to employ a vocabulary of a nature more familiar in ''hija'', satirical poetry."{{Sfn | Bosworth| 1976| p = 32}} For example, in one of his [[Zoology|zoological]] works, he satirized the preference for longer [[human penis size]], writing: "If the length of the penis were a sign of honor, then the [[mule]] would belong to the (honorable tribe of) [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]]". Another satirical story based on this preference was an ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale called "Ali with the Large Member".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia | first1 = Ulrich | last1 = Marzolph | first2 = Richard | last2 = van Leeuwen| first3 = Hassan | last3 = Wassouf | publisher = ABC-CLIO| year = 2004 | isbn= 1-57607-204-5|pages=97–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 10th century, the writer [[Tha'alibi]] recorded satirical poetry written by the Arabic poets As-Salami and Abu Dulaf, with As-Salami praising Abu Dulaf's [[Polymath|wide breadth of knowledge]] and then mocking his ability in all these subjects, and with Abu Dulaf responding back and satirizing As-Salami in return.{{Sfn | Bosworth| 1976| pp = 77–8}} An example of Arabic political satire included another 10th-century poet Jarir satirizing Farazdaq as "a transgressor of the [[Sharia]]" and later Arabic poets in turn using the term "Farazdaq-like" as a form of political satire.{{Sfn | Bosworth| 1976| p = 70}}

The terms "[[comedy]]" and "satire" became synonymous after [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' was translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], where it was elaborated upon by [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] and writers, such as Abu Bischr, his pupil [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]. Due to cultural differences, they disassociated comedy from [[Greek drama]]tic representation and instead identified it with [[Arabic poetry|Arabic poetic]] themes and forms, such as ''hija'' (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the "art of reprehension", and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or troubled beginnings and happy endings, associated with classical Greek comedy. After the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], the term "comedy" thus gained a new semantic meaning in [[Medieval literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Comedy as Satire in Hispano-Arabic Spain |first=Edwin J |last=Webber|journal=Hispanic Review|volume=26|issue=1|date=January 1958|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|pages=1–11|doi=10.2307/470561| jstor=470561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ubayd Zakani]] introduced satire in [[Persian literature]] during the 14th century. His work is noted for its satire and obscene verses, often political or bawdy, and often cited in debates involving [[homosexual]] practices. He wrote the ''Resaleh-ye Delgosha'', as well as ''Akhlaq al-Ashraf'' ("Ethics of the Aristocracy") and the famous humorous fable ''Masnavi Mush-O-Gorbeh'' (Mouse and Cat), which was a political satire. His non-satirical serious classical verses have also been regarded as very well written, in league with the other great works of [[Persian literature]]. Between 1905 and 1911, [[Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi]] and other Iranian writers wrote notable satires.

===Medieval Europe===
In the [[Early Middle Ages]], examples of satire were the songs by [[Goliard]]s or [[Clerici vagantes|vagant]]s now best known as an anthology called [[Carmina Burana]] and made famous as texts of a composition by the 20th-century composer [[Carl Orff]]. Satirical poetry is believed to have been popular, although little has survived. With the advent of the [[High Middle Ages]] and the birth of modern [[vernacular literature]] in the 12th century, it began to be used again, most notably by [[Chaucer]]. The disrespectful manner was considered "unchristian" and ignored, except for the '''moral satire''', which mocked misbehaviour in Christian terms. Examples are ''[[Livre des Manières]]'' by {{ill|Étienne de Fougères|fr}} (~1178), and some of Chaucer's ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. Sometimes [[Epic poetry|epic poetry (epos)]] was mocked, and even feudal society, but there was hardly a general interest in the genre.

===Early modern western satire===
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Parable of the Blind Leading the Blind - WGA3511.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]'s 1568 satirical painting ''[[The Blind Leading the Blind]]''.]]
Direct [[social commentary]] via satire returned with a vengeance in the 16th century, when farcical texts such as the works of [[François Rabelais]] tackled more serious issues (and incurred the wrath of the crown as a result).

Two major satirists of [[Europe]] in the [[Renaissance]] were [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] and [[François Rabelais]]. Other examples of Renaissance satire include ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]'', ''[[Reynard the Fox]]'', [[Sebastian Brant]]'s ''[[Ship of Fools|Narrenschiff]]'' (1494), [[Erasmus]]'s ''[[Moriae Encomium]]'' (1509), [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516), and ''[[Carajicomedia]]'' (1519).'''

The [[Elizabethan]] (i.e. 16th-century English) writers thought of satire as related to the notoriously rude, coarse and sharp satyr play. Elizabethan "satire" (typically in pamphlet form) therefore contains more straightforward abuse than subtle irony. The French [[Huguenot]] [[Isaac Casaubon]] pointed out in 1605 that satire in the Roman fashion was something altogether more civilised. Casaubon discovered and published Quintilian's writing and presented the original meaning of the term (satira, not satyr), and the sense of wittiness (reflecting the "dishfull of fruits") became more important again. Seventeenth-century English satire once again aimed at the "amendment of vices" ([[Dryden]]).

In the 1590s a new wave of verse satire broke with the publication of [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Hall]]'s ''Virgidemiarum'', six books of verse satires targeting everything from literary fads to corrupt noblemen. Although [[John Donne|Donne]] had already circulated satires in manuscript, Hall's was the first real attempt in English at verse satire on the Juvenalian model.{{Sfn | Hall | 1969 | ps =: ‘Hall's ''Virgidemiae'' was a new departure in that the true Juvenalian mode of satire was being attempted for the first time, and successfully, in English.’}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=October 2012}} The success of his work combined with a national mood of disillusion in the last years of Elizabeth's reign triggered an avalanche of satire—much of it less conscious of classical models than Hall's — until the fashion was brought to an abrupt stop by censorship.{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London, the censors of the press, issued Orders to the Stationers' Company on June 1 and 4, 1599, prohibiting the further printing of satires—the so-called 'Bishop's Ban'.{{Sfn | Davenport | 1969}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=October 2012}}}}

===Age of Enlightenment===
[[File:A Welch wedding. Satire c.1780.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|'A Welch wedding' Satirical Cartoon c.1780]]
The [[Age of Enlightenment]], an intellectual movement in the 17th and 18th centuries advocating rationality, produced a great revival of satire in Britain. This was fuelled by the rise of partisan politics, with the formalisation of the [[Tory]] and [[British Whig Party|Whig]] parties—and also, in 1714, by the formation of the [[Scriblerus Club]], which included [[Alexander Pope]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[John Gay]], [[John Arbuthnot]], [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], [[Thomas Parnell]], and [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke]]. This club included several of the notable satirists of early-18th-century Britain. They focused their attention on Martinus Scriblerus, "an invented learned fool... whose work they attributed all that was tedious, narrow-minded, and pedantic in contemporary scholarship".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century | volume = 3 | page = 435}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their hands astute and biting satire of institutions and individuals became a popular weapon. The turn to the 18th century was characterized by a switch from Horatian, soft, pseudo-satire, to biting "juvenal" satire.&lt;ref name="Weinbrot2007p136"&gt;Weinbrot, Howard D. (2007) ''Eighteenth-Century Satire: Essays on Text and Context from Dryden to Peter...'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=vHADZOHbJ2QC&amp;pg=PA136 p.136]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Swift]] was one of the greatest of Anglo-Irish satirists, and one of the first to practise modern journalistic satire. For instance, In his ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' Swift suggests that Irish peasants be encouraged to sell their own children as food for the rich, as a solution to the "problem" of poverty. His purpose is of course to attack indifference to the plight of the desperately poor. In his book ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' he writes about the flaws in human society in general and English society in particular. [[John Dryden]] wrote an influential essay entitled "A Discourse Concerning the Original and Progress of Satire"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/drydendiscourse2.html | editor-first = Jack | editor-last = Lynch | publisher = Rutgers | last = Dryden | first = John | title = Discourse | number = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; that helped fix the definition of satire in the literary world. His satirical ''[[Mac Flecknoe]]'' was written in response to a rivalry with [[Thomas Shadwell]] and eventually inspired [[Alexander Pope]] to write his satirical ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''. Other satirical works by Pope include the ''[[Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot]]''.

[[Alexander Pope]] (b. May 21, 1688) was a satirist known for his Horatian satirist style and translation of the ''[[Iliad]]''. Famous throughout and after the [[Long eighteenth century|long 18th century]], Pope died in 1744.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/alexander-pope-9444371#synopsis|title=Biography of Alexander Pope § Synopsis|work=Biography.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope, in his ''The Rape of the Lock'', is delicately chiding society in a sly but polished voice by holding up a mirror to the follies and vanities of the upper class. Pope does not actively attack the self-important pomp of the British aristocracy, but rather presents it in such a way that gives the reader a new perspective from which to easily view the actions in the story as foolish and ridiculous. A mockery of the upper class, more delicate and lyrical than brutal, Pope nonetheless is able to effectively illuminate the moral degradation of society to the public. ''The Rape of the Lock'' assimilates the masterful qualities of a heroic epic, such as the ''Iliad'', which Pope was translating at the time of writing ''The Rape of the Lock''. However, Pope applied these qualities satirically to a seemingly petty egotistical elitist quarrel to prove his point wryly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/545/satire-in-18th-century-british-society-alexander-popes-the-rape-of-the-lock-and-jonathan-swifts-a-modest-proposal|title=Satire in 18th Century British Society: Alexander Pope's ''The Rape of the Lock'' and Jonathan Swift's ''A Modest Proposal''|year=2011|journal=Student Pulse|volume=3|issue=06|author=Jonathan J.

[[Daniel Defoe]] pursued a more journalistic type of satire, being famous for his ''[[The True-Born Englishman]]'' which mocks [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] patriotism, and ''[[The Shortest-Way with the Dissenters]]''—advocating [[religious toleration]] by means of an ironical exaggeration of the highly intolerant attitudes of his time.

The pictorial satire of [[William Hogarth]] is a precursor to the development of [[political cartoons]] in 18th-century England.&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fwzWAAAAMAAJ|title=The Political Cartoon|author=Charles Press|year=1981|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medium developed under the direction of its greatest exponent, [[James Gillray]] from London.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; With his satirical works calling the king (George III), prime ministers and generals (especially Napoleon) to account, Gillray's wit and keen sense of the ridiculous made him the pre-eminent [[cartoonist]] of the era.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Satire, sewers and statesmen: why James Gillray was king of the cartoon|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/mar/21/satire-sewers-and-statesmen-james-gillray-king-of-cartoon|agency=The Guardian|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ebenezer Cooke (poet)|Ebenezer Cooke]] (1665–1732), author of "The Sot-Weed Factor" (1708), was among the first American colonialists to write literary satire. [[Benjamin Franklin]] (1706–1790) and others followed, using satire to shape an emerging nation's culture through its sense of the ridiculous.

===Satire in Victorian England===
[[File:DV257 no.19 The donkey race.png|thumb|A Victorian satirical sketch depicting a gentleman's donkey race in 1852]]
Several satiric papers competed for the public's attention in the [[Victorian era]] (1837–1901) and [[Edwardian]] period, such as ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' (1841) and ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' (1861).

Perhaps the most enduring examples of Victorian satire, however, are to be found in the [[Savoy Opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. In fact, in ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', a jester is given lines that paint a very neat picture of the method and purpose of the satirist, and might almost be taken as a statement of Gilbert's own intent:
:''"I can set a braggart quailing with a quip,
:''The upstart I can wither with a whim;
:''He may wear a merry laugh upon his lip,
:''But his laughter has an echo that is grim!"

Novelists such as [[Charles Dickens]] (1812-1870) often used passages of satiric writing in their treatment of social issues.

Continuing the tradition of Swiftian journalistic satire, [[Sidney Godolphin Osborne]] (1808-1889) was the most prominent writer of scathing "Letters to the Editor" of the [[London Times]]. Famous in his day, he is now all but forgotten. His maternal grandfather [[William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland]] was considered to be a possible candidate for the authorship of the [[Junius]] letters. If this were true, we can read Osborne as following in his grandfather's satiric "Letters to the Editor" path. Osborne's satire was so bitter and biting that at one point he received a public censure from [[Parliament]]'s then Home Secretary Sir [[James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose|James Graham]]. Osborne wrote mostly in the Juvenalian mode over a wide range of topics mostly centered on British government's and landlords' mistreatment of poor farm workers and field laborers. He bitterly opposed the [[New Poor Laws]] and was passionate on the subject of Great Britain's botched response to the [[Irish Famine]] and its mistreatment of soldiers during the [[Crimean War]].

Later in the nineteenth century, in the United States, [[Mark Twain]] (1835–1910) grew to become American's greatest satirist: his novel ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1884) is set in the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] South, where the moral values Twain wishes to promote are completely turned on their heads. His hero, Huck, is a rather simple but goodhearted lad who is ashamed of the "sinful temptation" that leads him to help a runaway [[Slavery|slave]]. In fact his conscience, warped by the distorted moral world he has grown up in, often bothers him most when he is at his best. He is prepared to do good, believing it to be wrong.

Twain's younger contemporary [[Ambrose Bierce]] (1842–1913) gained notoriety as a [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynic]], pessimist and black humorist with his dark, bitterly ironic stories, many set during the [[American Civil War]], which satirized the limitations of human perception and reason. Bierce's most famous work of satire is probably ''[[The Devil's Dictionary]]'' (1906), in which the definitions mock cant, [[hypocrisy]] and [[Appeal to tradition|received wisdom]].

===20th-century satire===
[[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] is considered the first major European satirist since [[Jonathan Swift]].&lt;ref name="Knight2004p254"&gt;Knight, Charles A. (2004) ''Literature of Satire'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=SOfVePSFctgC&amp;pg=PA254 p.254]&lt;/ref&gt; In 20th-century literature, satire was used by English authors such as [[Aldous Huxley]] (1930s) and [[George Orwell]] (1940s), which under the inspiration of [[Yevgeny Zamyatin|Zamyatin]]'s Russian 1921 novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', made serious and even frightening commentaries on the dangers of the sweeping social changes taking place throughout Europe. Many social critics of this same time in the United States, such as [[Dorothy Parker]] and [[H. L. Mencken]], used satire as their main weapon, and Mencken in particular is noted for having said that "one horse-laugh is worth ten thousand [[syllogism]]s" in the persuasion of the public to accept a criticism. Novelist [[Sinclair Lewis]] was known for his satirical stories such as ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'' (1920), ''[[Babbitt (novel)|Babbitt]]'' (1922), ''[[Elmer Gantry]]'' (1927; dedicated by Lewis to H. L. Menchen), and ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'' (1935), and his books often explored and satirized contemporary American values. The film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940) by [[Charlie Chaplin]] is itself a parody of [[Adolf Hitler]]; Chaplin later declared that he would have not made the film if he had known about the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].&lt;ref name="ChaplinLager"&gt;Chaplin (1964) ''My Autobiography'', p.392, quotation: {{quotation|Had I known of the actual horrors of the German concentration camps, I could not have made ''The Great Dictator'', I could not have made fun of the homicidal insanity of the Nazis.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dictator charlie6.jpg|thumb|Benzino Napaloni and [[Adenoid Hynkel]] in ''The Great Dictator'' (1940). Chaplin later declared that he would have not made the film if he had known about the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].&lt;ref name="ChaplinLager"/&gt;]]
In the United States 1950s, satire was introduced into American [[stand-up comedy]] most prominently by [[Lenny Bruce]] and [[Mort Sahl]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p8"/&gt; As they challenged the [[taboo]]s and [[conventional wisdom]] of the time, were ostracized by the mass media establishment as ''[[sick comedian]]s''. In the same period, [[Paul Krassner]]'s magazine ''[[The Realist]]'' began publication, to become immensely popular during the 1960s and early 1970s among people in the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]; it had articles and cartoons that were savage, biting satires of politicians such as [[Lyndon Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]], the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Cold War]] and the [[War on Drugs]]. This baton was also carried by the original [[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]] magazine, edited by [[Doug Kenney]] and [[Henry Beard]] and featuring blistering satire written by [[Michael O'Donoghue]], [[P.J. O'Rourke]], and [[Tony Hendra]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/07/01/funny-pages-how-the-national-lampoon-made-american-humor.html&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent satiric stand-up comedian [[George Carlin]] acknowledged the influence ''The Realist'' had in his 1970s conversion to a satiric comedian.&lt;ref name="Sullivan2010p94"&gt;Sullivan, James (2010) ''Seven Dirty Words: The Life and Crimes of George Carlin'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=y3dzVQ5wX9UC&amp;pg=PA94 p.94]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Carlin]] (2002) ''[http://paulkrassner.com/carlinintro.htm Introduction]'' to ''Murder At the Conspiracy Convention''&lt;/ref&gt;

A more humorous brand of satire enjoyed a renaissance in the UK in the early 1960s with the [[satire boom]], led by such luminaries as [[Peter Cook]], [[Alan Bennett]], [[Jonathan Miller]], and [[Dudley Moore]], whose stage show ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'' was a hit not only in Britain, but also in the United States. Other significant influences in 1960s British satire include [[David Frost]], [[Eleanor Bron]] and the [[television program]] ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jun/14/david-frost-satire-documentary "David Frost's Q&amp;A on how to be a satirist"]. ''The Guardian'' (London). Retrieved February 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Heller]]'s most famous work, ''[[Catch-22]]'' (1961), satirizes bureaucracy and the military, and is frequently cited as one of the greatest literary works of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1868619.stm |title=What is Catch-22?

The film ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964) starring [[Peter Sellers]] was a popular satire on the [[Cold War]].

===Contemporary satire===
Contemporary popular usage of the term "satire" is often very imprecise. While satire often uses [[caricature]] and [[parody]], by no means all uses of these or other humorous devices are satiric. Refer to the careful definition of satire that heads this article.

[[File:Spitting Image Puppet of Eric Cantona (2956625432).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Puppet of Manchester United striker [[Eric Cantona]] from the British satirical puppet show ''[[Spitting Image]]'']]
Satire is used on many UK television programmes, particularly popular panel shows and quiz shows such as ''[[Mock the Week]]'' (2005) and ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' (1990–ongoing). It is found on radio quiz shows such as ''[[The News Quiz]]'' (1977–ongoing) and ''[[The Now Show]]'' (1998–ongoing). One of the most watched UK television shows of the 1980s and early 1990s, the puppet show ''[[Spitting Image]]'' was a satire of the [[British Royal Family|royal family]], politics, entertainment, sport and [[British culture]] of the era.&lt;ref&gt;Van Norris (2014).

The television program ''[[South Park]]'' (1997–ongoing) relies almost exclusively on satire to address issues in American culture, with episodes addressing [[The Passion of the Jew|anti-Semitism]], [[Go God Go|militant atheism]], [[Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride|homophobia]], [[Rainforest Shmainforest|environmentalism]], [[Gnomes (South Park)|corporate culture]], [[The Death Camp of Tolerance|political correctness]] and [[Red Hot Catholic Love|anti-Catholicism]], among many other issues.

Australian [[Chris Lilley (comedian)|Chris Lilley]] produces comedy art in the style of mockumentaries (''[[We Can Be Heroes: Finding The Australian of the Year|We Can Be Heroes]]'', ''[[Summer Heights High]]'', ''[[Angry Boys]]'') and his work is often described as complex social satire.

[[File:Stephen Colbert by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Stephen Colbert]] satirically impersonated an opinionated and self-righteous television commentator on his [[Comedy Central]] program in the U.S.]]
[[Stephen Colbert]]'s television program, ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' (2005–14), is instructive in the methods of contemporary American satire. [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Colbert's character]] is an opinionated and self-righteous commentator who, in his TV interviews, interrupts people, points and wags his finger at them, and "unwittingly" uses a number of logical fallacies. In doing so, he demonstrates the principle of modern American political satire: the ridicule of the actions of politicians and other public figures by taking all their statements and purported beliefs to their furthest (supposedly) logical conclusion, thus revealing their perceived hypocrisy or absurdity.

The American sketch comedy television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' is also known for its satirical impressions and parodies of prominent persons and politicians, among some of the most notable, their parodies of U.S. political figures [[Saturday Night Live parodies of Hillary Clinton|Hillary Clinton]]&lt;ref name=TVGuide1&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/news/snl-hillary-clinton-saturday-night-live-kate-mckinnon-amy-poehler/ Liz Raftery – "Who Did the Best Hillary Clinton Impression on SNL?", ''TV Guide'', April 30, 2015.

Other political satire includes various political causes in the past, including the relatively successful [[Polish Beer-Lovers' Party]] and the joke political candidates Molly the Dog&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.mollythedog2008.com/ | title = Molly the Dog | year = 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090122053639/http://mollythedog2008.com/ | archivedate = January 22, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brian Miner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.brianminer2008.com/ | title = Brian Miner | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, a popular modern satirist is Sir [[Terry Pratchett]], author of the internationally best-selling ''[[Discworld]]'' book series. One of the most well-known and controversial British satirists is [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]], co-writer and director of ''[[Four Lions]]''.

In Canada, satire has become an important part of the comedy scene. [[Stephen Leacock]] was one of the best known early Canadian satirists, and in the early 20th century, he achieved fame by targeting the attitudes of small town life. In more recent years, Canada has had several prominent satirical television series and radio shows. Some, including ''[[CODCO]]'', ''[[The Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'', ''[[This Is That]]'', and ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' deal directly with current news stories and political figures, while others, like ''[[History Bites]]'' present contemporary social satire in the context of events and figures in history. The Canadian organization ''[[Canada News Network]]'' provides commentary on contemporary news events that are primarily Canadian in nature. Canadian songwriter [[Nancy White (singer-songwriter)|Nancy White]] uses music as the vehicle for her satire, and her comic folk songs are regularly played on [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio]].

Cartoonists often use satire as well as straight humour. [[Al Capp]]'s satirical [[comic strip]] ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' was censored in September 1947. The controversy, as reported in ''Time'', centred on Capp's portrayal of the US Senate. Said Edward Leech of Scripps-Howard, "We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks... boobs and undesirables."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804275,00.html |title=Tain't Funny – ''Time'' |publisher=Time.com |date=September 29, 1947 |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Kelly]]'s ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' was likewise censored in 1952 over his overt satire of [[Joseph McCarthy|Senator Joe McCarthy]], caricatured in his comic strip as "Simple J. Malarky". [[Garry Trudeau]], whose [[comic strip]] ''[[Doonesbury]]'' focuses on satire of the political system, and provides a trademark cynical view on national events. Trudeau exemplifies humour mixed with criticism. For example, the character [[Mark Slackmeyer]] lamented that because he was not legally married to his partner, he was deprived of the "exquisite agony" of experiencing a nasty and painful divorce like heterosexuals. This, of course, satirized the claim that gay unions would denigrate the sanctity of heterosexual marriage.

[[File:2014- 02 - Obama and Putin, by Ranan Lurie.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Political satire by [[Ranan Lurie]]]]
Like some literary predecessors, many recent television satires contain strong elements of parody and [[caricature]]; for instance, the popular animated series ''The Simpsons'' and ''South Park'' both parody modern family and social life by taking their assumptions to the extreme; both have led to the creation of similar series. As well as the purely humorous effect of this sort of thing, they often strongly criticise various phenomena in politics, economic life, religion and many other aspects of society, and thus qualify as satirical. Due to their animated nature, these shows can easily use images of public figures and generally have greater freedom to do so than conventional shows using live actors.

[[News satire]] is also a very popular form of contemporary satire, appearing in as wide an array of formats as the news media itself: print (e.g. ''[[The Onion]]'', ''[[Canada News Network]]'', ''[[Private Eye]]''), "Not Your Homepage,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notyourhomepage.com/|title=Not Your Homepage – Check Your Morals At The Door, Come See the Internet Lore!|work=notyourhomepage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; radio (e.g. ''[[On the Hour]]''), television (e.g. ''[[The Day Today]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'', ''[[Brass Eye]]'') and the web (e.g. [[Mindry.in]], The Fruit Dish, [[Scunt News]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scunt.co.uk/ |title=FRONT PAGE – Satirical News, Review, Comment &amp; Analysis |publisher=Scunt.co.uk |accessdate=August 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130421054837/http://www.scunt.co.uk/ |archivedate=April 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faking News]], [[El Koshary Today]], The Giant Napkin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegiantnapkin.com/ |title=The Giant Napkin |publisher=Thegiantnapkin.com |accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unconfirmed Sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unconfirmedsources.com/ |title=Unconfirmedsources.com |publisher=Unconfirmedsources.com |accessdate=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The ''Onion''{{'}}s website). Other satires are on the [[list of satirists and satires]]. Another internet-driven form of satire is to lampoon bad internet performers. An example of this is the [[Internet meme]] character [[Miranda Sings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ng | first = David | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/05/miranda-sings-colleen-ballinger-jim-caruso-cast-party-jersey-boys-daniel-reichard.html | title = YouTube sensation Miranda seduces Broadway | journal = Los Angeles Times | date = May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/10/04/PKGE19REP8.DTL | title = This Week | journal = San Francisco Chronicle | date = October 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Wikinews]]'', Sean Mills, President of ''[[The Onion]]'', said angry letters about their news parody always carried the same message. "It's whatever affects that person", said Mills. "So it's like, 'I love it when you make a joke about murder or rape, but if you talk about cancer, well my brother has cancer and that's not funny to me.' Or someone else can say, 'Cancer's ''hilarious'', but don't talk about rape because my cousin got raped.' Those are rather extreme examples, but if it affects somebody personally, they tend to be more sensitive about it."&lt;ref name=DS&gt;[[n:The Onion: An interview with 'America's Finest News Source'|An interview with The Onion]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', November 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
Literary satire is usually written out of earlier satiric works, [[Reprise#In literature|reprising]] previous conventions, commonplaces, stance, situations and tones of voice.&lt;ref name="Griffin1994p136"&gt;Griffin, Dustin H. (1994) ''Satire: A Critical Reintroduction'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=MLM2edymLtUC&amp;pg=PA136 p.136]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exaggeration]] is one of the most common satirical techniques.&lt;ref name="Claridge2010p257"&gt;Claridge, Claudia (2010) ''Hyperbole in English: A Corpus-based Study of Exaggeration'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=aegq_QdX6h8C&amp;pg=PA257 p.257]&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarily [[Diminution (satire)|diminution]] is also a satirical technique.

==Legal status==
For its nature and social role, satire has enjoyed in many societies a special freedom license to mock prominent individuals and institutions.&lt;ref name="Test1991p9licencequote"/&gt; In Germany&lt;ref name="Geisler2005p73"/&gt; and Italy&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt; satire is protected by the constitution.

Since satire belongs to the realm of [[art]] and artistic expression, it benefits from broader lawfulness limits than mere [[freedom of information]] of journalistic kind.&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt; In some countries a specific "right to satire" is recognized and its limits go beyond the "right to report" of journalism and even the "right to criticize".&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt; Satire benefits not only of the protection to [[freedom of speech]], but also to that to [[culture]], and that to scientific and artistic production.&lt;ref name="Bevere2006p265"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pezzella2009p566"/&gt;

Descriptions of satire's biting effect on its target include 'venomous', 'cutting', 'stinging',&lt;ref name="Kinservik2002p21"&gt;Kinservik, Matthew J. (2002) ''Disciplining Satire: The Censorship of Satiric Comedy on the Eighteenth...'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=haUcp4-01DMC&amp;pg=PA21 p.21]&lt;/ref&gt; vitriol. Because satire often combines anger and humor, as well as the fact that it addresses and calls into question many controversial issues, it can be profoundly disturbing.

===Typical arguments===
Because it is essentially ironic or sarcastic, satire is often misunderstood. A typical misunderstanding is to confuse the satirist with his [[persona]].&lt;ref name="Test1991p10"/&gt;

====Bad taste====
Common uncomprehending responses to satire include revulsion (accusations of [[Taste (sociology)|poor taste]], or that "it's just not funny" for instance) and the idea that the satirist actually does support the ideas, policies, or people he is attacking. For instance, at the time of its publication, many people misunderstood Swift's purpose in ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'', assuming it to be a serious recommendation of economically motivated cannibalism.

====Targeting the victim====
Some critics of [[Mark Twain]] see [[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (novel)|''Huckleberry Finn'']] as [[racist]] and offensive, missing the point that its author clearly intended it to be satire (racism being in fact only one of a number of Mark Twain's known concerns attacked in ''Huckleberry Finn'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Leonard | first1 = James S | first2 = Thomas A | last2 = Tenney | first3 = Thadious M | last3 = Davis | title = Satire or Evasion?: Black Perspectives on Huckleberry Finn | publisher = [[Duke University Press]] |date=December 1992 | page = 224 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=fdrBtpSSCisC&amp;pg=RA1-PA116&amp;lpg=RA1-PA116&amp;dq=hemingway+%22huckleberry+finn%22+%22green+hills%22 | isbn = 978-0-8223-1174-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Shelley Fisher | last = Fishin | title = Lighting out for the Territory: Reflections on Mark Twain and American Culture | place = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same misconception was suffered by the main character of the 1960s British television comedy satire ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]''. The character of [[Alf Garnett]] (played by [[Warren Mitchell]]) was created to poke fun at the kind of narrow-minded, racist, [[little Englander]] that Garnett represented. Instead, his character became a sort of [[anti-hero]] to people who actually agreed with his views. (The same situation occurred with [[Archie Bunker]] in American TV show ''[[All in the Family]]'', a character derived directly from Garnett.)

The Australian satirical television comedy show ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]'' has suffered repeated attacks based on various perceived interpretations of the "target" of its attacks. The "Make a Realistic Wish Foundation" sketch (June 2009), which attacked in classical satiric fashion the heartlessness of people who are reluctant to donate to [[Charitable organization|charities]], was widely interpreted as an attack on the [[Make a Wish Foundation]], or even the terminally ill children helped by that organisation. [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] of the time [[Kevin Rudd]] stated that The Chaser team "should hang their heads in shame". He went on to say that "I didn't see that but it's been described to me. ...But having a go at kids with a terminal illness is really beyond the pale, absolutely beyond the pale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/06/04/2589532.htm |title='Hang your heads' Rudd tells Chaser boys | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=June 4, 2009|accessdate=June 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television station management suspended the show for two weeks and reduced the third season to eight episodes.

====Romantic prejudice====
The romantic prejudice against satire is the belief spread by the [[Romanticism|romantic movement]] that satire is something unworthy of serious attention; this prejudice has held considerable influence to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sutherland | first = James | year = 1958 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4kc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 | title = English Satire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such prejudice extends to humour and everything that arouses laughter, which are often underestimated as frivolous and unworthy of serious study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Rod A | last = Martin | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ieAcp2Z_zkIC&amp;pg=PA27 | title = The Psychology of Humor: An Integrative Approach | pages = 27–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, humor is generally neglected as a topic of anthropological research and teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Apte | first = Mahadev L | year = 1985 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4fuAAAAAMAAJ | title = Humor and laughter: an anthropological approach | chapter = Introduction | page = 23 | quote = The general neglect of humor as a topic of anthropological research is reflected in teaching practice. Most introductory textbooks do not even list humor as a significant characteristic of cultural systems together with kinship, social roles, behavioral patterns, religion, language, economic transactions, political institutions, values, and material culture.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of opposition toward notable satires===
[[File:Emergency Twitter Was Down.jpg|thumb|right|Satire on [[internet culture]]]]
Because satire criticises in an ironic, essentially indirect way, it frequently escapes [[censorship]] in a way more direct criticism might not. Periodically, however, it runs into serious opposition, and people in power who perceive themselves as attacked attempt to censor it or prosecute its practitioners. In a classic example, [[Aristophanes]] was persecuted by the [[demagogue]] [[Cleon]].

====1599 book ban====
In 1599, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[John Whitgift]] and the [[Bishop of London]] [[Richard Bancroft]], whose offices had the function of licensing books for publication in [[England]], issued a decree banning verse satire. The decree, now known as the [[Bishops' Ban of 1599]], ordered the burning of certain volumes of satire by [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]], and others; it also required histories and plays to be specially approved by a member of the Queen's [[Privy Council]], and it prohibited the future printing of satire in verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = A Transcript of the Registers of the Company of Stationers of London, 1554–1640 | volume = III | editor-first = Edward | editor-last = Arber | place = London | year = 1875–94 | page = 677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motives for the ban are obscure, particularly since some of the books banned had been licensed by the same authorities less than a year earlier. Various scholars have argued that the target was obscenity, libel, or sedition. It seems likely that lingering anxiety about the [[Martin Marprelate]] controversy, in which the bishops themselves had employed satirists, played a role; both [[Thomas Nashe]] and [[Gabriel Harvey]], two of the key figures in that controversy, suffered a complete ban on all their works. In the event, though, the ban was little enforced, even by the licensing authority itself.

====21st-century polemics====
In 2005, the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] caused global protests by offended Muslims and violent attacks with many [[wikt:fatality|fatalities]] in the [[Near East]]. It was not the first case of [[Muslim]] protests against criticism in the form of satire, but the Western world was surprised by the hostility of the reaction: Any country's flag in which a newspaper chose to publish the parodies was being burnt in a Near East country, then embassies were attacked, killing 139 people in mainly four countries; politicians throughout Europe agreed that satire was an aspect of the [[freedom of speech]], and therefore to be a protected means of dialogue. Iran threatened to start an [[International Holocaust Cartoon Competition]], which was immediately responded to by Jews with an [[Israeli Anti-Semitic Cartoons Contest]].

In 2006 British comedian [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] released ''[[Borat|Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]]'', a "[[mockumentary]]" that satirized everyone, from high society to frat boys. The film was criticized by many. Although Baron Cohen is Jewish, some complained that it was [[antisemitism|antisemitic]], and the government of [[Kazakhstan]] boycotted the film. The film itself had been a reaction to a longer quarrel between the government and the comedian.

In 2008, popular South African cartoonist and satirist [[Jonathan Shapiro]] (who is published under the pen name Zapiro) came under fire for depicting then-president of the [[African National Congress|ANC]] [[Jacob Zuma]] in the act of undressing in preparation for the implied rape of 'Lady Justice' which is held down by Zuma loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-12-18-zuma-claims-r7m-over-zapiro-cartoon| work = Mail and Guardian | date = December 18, 2008 | location = [[South Africa|ZA]] | title= Zuma claims R7m over Zapiro cartoon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoon was drawn in response to Zuma's efforts to duck corruption charges, and the controversy was heightened by the fact that Zuma was himself acquitted of [[Jacob Zuma rape trial|rape]] in May 2006. In February 2009, the [[SABC|South African Broadcasting Corporation]], viewed by some opposition parties as the mouthpiece of the governing ANC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=248529&amp;area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__national/ | work = Mail and Guardian | format = interview | title = Democratic Alliance spokesperson Helen Zille| accessdate = August 2005 | location = ZA}}&lt;/ref&gt; shelved a satirical TV show created by Shapiro,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=308632 |work=Dispatch |location=ZA |title=ZNews: Zapiro's puppet show |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326004224/http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=308632 |archivedate=March 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in May 2009 the broadcaster pulled a documentary about political satire (featuring Shapiro among others) for the second time, hours before scheduled broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-05-26-sabc-pulls-zapiro-doccie-again| work = Mail and Guardian | date = September 26, 2009 | location = ZA | title=SABC pulls Zapiro doccie, again}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apartheid South Africa]] also had a long history of censorship.

On December 29, 2009, Samsung sued [[Michael Breen (author)|Mike Breen]], and the ''[[The Korea Times|Korea Times]]'' for $1 million, claiming criminal defamation over a satirical column published on Christmas Day, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100510/1820159367.shtml |title=Samsung Sues Satirist, Claiming Criminal Defamation, Over Satirical Column Poking Fun At Samsung |publisher=Techdirt |date=May 11, 2010 |accessdate= June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/asia/la-fg-korea-samsung-20100510,0,7395282,full.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=John M | last=Glionna | date=May 10, 2010 | title=Samsung doesn't find satirical spoof amusing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 2015, the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) requested [[Kent Police]] investigate the [[BBC]], claiming that comments made about Party leader [[Nigel Farage]] by a panelist on the comedy show ''[[Have I Got News For You]]'' might hinder his chances of success in the general election (which would take place a week later), and claimed the BBC breached the Representation of the People Act.&lt;ref name="UKIP"/&gt; Kent Police rebuffed the request to open an investigation, and the BBC released a statement, "Britain has a proud tradition of satire, and everyone knows that the contributors on ''Have I Got News for You'' regularly make jokes at the expense of politicians of all parties."&lt;ref name="UKIP"&gt;[http://www.itv.com/news/2015-04-29/ukip-asks-police-to-investigate-the-bbc-over-have-i-got-news-for-you/ "Ukip asks police to investigate the BBC over Have I Got News for You"].

==Satirical prophecy==
Satire is occasionally prophetic: the jokes precede actual events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Paul Krassner | first = Paul | last = Krassner | url = http://nypress.com/terminal-velocity-television-is-here/ | title = Terminal velocity television is here | journal = New York Press | volume = 16 | issue = 35 | date = August 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LuttazziProphetic"&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Daniele Luttazzi | first = Daniele | last = Luttazzi | title = Lepidezze postribolari | year = 2007 | publisher = Feltrinelli | page = 275 | language = Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the eminent examples are:
* The 1784 presaging of modern [[daylight saving time]], later actually proposed in 1907. While an American envoy to France, [[Benjamin Franklin]] anonymously published a letter in 1784 suggesting that [[Paris]]ians economise on candles by arising earlier to use morning sunlight.&lt;ref name='Franklin'&gt;{{cite journal|author-link = Benjamin Franklin | first = Benjamin | last = Franklin |title=Aux auteurs du Journal|journal=[[Journal de Paris]]|date=April 26, 1784|issue= 117|language = French}}  Wrote [[anonymously]]. Its first publication was in the journal's "Économie" section.  {{Citation | url = http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/franklin3.html | edition = revised English version | accessdate = May 26, 2007 | title = An Economical Project}} has a title that is not Franklin's; see {{cite journal|author=A.O. Aldridge|title=Franklin's essay on daylight saving|journal=American Literature|issue=1|pages=23–29|year=1956| doi = 10.2307/2922719 |publisher=American Literature | volume = 28 |jstor=2922719}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the 1920s, an English [[cartoonist]] imagined a laughable thing for the time: a hotel for cars. He drew a [[multi-story car park]].&lt;ref name="LuttazziProphetic" /&gt;
*The second episode of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', which debuted in 1969, featured a ''[[Sketch comedy|skit]]'' entitled "[[The Mouse Problem]]" (meant to satirize contemporary media exposés on homosexuality), which depicted a cultural phenomenon eerily similar to modern [[furry fandom]] (which did not become widespread until the 1980s, over a decade after the skit was first aired).
* The comedy film ''[[Americathon]]'', released in 1979 and set in the United States of 1998, predicted a number of trends and events that would eventually unfold in the near future, including an American debt crisis, Chinese [[capitalism]], the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], [[terrorism]] aimed at the civilian population, a presidential sex scandal, and the popularity of [[reality shows]].
*In January 2001, a satirical news article in ''[[The Onion]]'', entitled "Our Long National Nightmare of Peace and Prosperity Is Finally Over"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28784 |title=Bush: 'Our Long National Nightmare of Peace And Prosperity Is Finally Over' | publisher= The Onion |accessdate= June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; had newly elected President George Bush vowing to "develop new and expensive weapons technologies" and to "engage in at least one Gulf War-level armed conflict in the next four years". Furthermore, he would "bring back economic stagnation by implementing substantial tax cuts, which would lead to a recession". This prophesied the [[Iraq War]] and to the [[Bush tax cuts]].
*In 1975, the first episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' included an ad for a triple blade razor called the Triple-Trac; in 2001, [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]] introduced the Mach3. In 2004, ''[[The Onion]]'' satirized [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] and Gillette's marketing of ever-increasingly multi-blade razors with a mock article proclaiming Gillette will now introduce a five-blade razor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/content/node/33930 |title=Fuck Everything, We're Doing Five Blades |publisher=The Onion |accessdate=June 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Gillette released the [[Gillette Fusion]], a five-blade razor.
*After the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|Iran nuclear deal]] in 2015, ''[[The Onion]]'' ran an article with the headline "U.S. Soothes Upset Netanyahu With Shipment Of Ballistic Missiles". Sure enough, reports broke the next day of the Obama administration offering military upgrades to Israel in the wake of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.666977 |title=Where Satire Meets Truth: Did The Onion Just Predict a Real Israeli Headline? |publisher=Haaretz |accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In July 2016, ''[[The Simpsons]]'' released the most recent in a string of satirical references to a potential ''[[Donald Trump]]'' presidency. Other media sources, including the popular film ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' have also made similar satirical references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/simpsons-predicted-president-trump-back-to-the-future |title=Back to the future: how the Simpsons and others predicted President Trump |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satire rose the daunting question of what role public opinion would play in government. (...) satirists criticized government activities, exposed ambiguities, and forced administrators to clarify or establish policies. Not surprisingly, heated public controversy surrounded satiric commentary, resulting in an outright ban on political satire in 1835 (...) Government officials cracked down on their humorous public criticism that challenged state authority through both its form and content. Satire had been a political resource in France for a long time, but the anxious political context of the July Monarchy had unlocked its political power.
Satire also taught lessons in democracy. It fit into the July Monarchy's tense political context as a voice in favor of public political debate. Satiric expression took place in the public sphere and spoke from a position of public opinion-that is, from a position of the nation’s expressing a political voice and making claims on its government representatives and leadership. Beyond mere entertainment, satire's humor appealed to and exercised public opinion, drawing audiences into new practices of representative government.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5308">'''Secondary orality''' is a concept in the work of scholar [[Walter J. Ong]], as first described in his book ''Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word'', published in 1982 (2nd ed. 2002), [[Walter J. Ong]] and discussing the differences between oral and literate cultures. 

In this book, Ong used the phrase ‘secondary orality’, describing it as “essentially a more deliberate and self-conscious orality, based permanently on the use of writing and print” (Ong, 1982, p.&amp;nbsp;133).&lt;ref&gt;Ong, W. J. (1982). ''Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing the Word''. New York: Methuen.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his way of thinking, secondary orality is not primary orality, the [[orality]] of pre-literate cultures. Oral societies operated on [[polychronic time]], with many things happening at once—socialization played a great role in the operation of these cultures, memory and memorization were of greater importance, increasing the amount of copiousness and redundancy. Oral cultures were additive rather than subordinate, closer to the human life world, and more situational and participatory than the more abstract qualities of literate cultures. 

Secondary orality is orality that is dependent on literate culture and the existence of writing, such as a television anchor reading the news or radio. While it exists in sound, it does not have the features of primary orality because it presumes and rests upon literate thought and expression, and may even be people reading written material. Thus, secondary orality is usually not as repetitive, redundant, agonistic, etc. the way primary orality is, and cultures that have a lot of secondary orality are not necessarily similar to primarily oral cultures. Secondary orality should not be confused with "oral residue" in which a culture has not fully transitioned to literate / written culture and retains many of the characteristics of primary oral cultures. Secondary orality is a phenomenon of post-literacy era, whereas oral residue is a stage in the transition from pre-literate to literate.

==The Gutenberg Parenthesis==
Ong notes that human communication has been dominated by oral culture, and the first signs of literacy date only 6 000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Ong, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Pettitt, Associate Professor of English at the University of Southern Denmark, agrees with Ong, ''et al.'', by considering literate learning more the anomaly than the rule.  He considers this to be a post-Gutenberg era where knowledge is formed through digital media, delivered over the internet.  Calling the previous 500 years a "Gutenberg Parenthesis", he explains that before Gutenberg, knowledge was formed orally and, now, in this post-Gutenberg era, knowledge is formed—increasingly—through "secondary orality" on the Internet. &lt;ref&gt;Pettitt, Tom ''Before the Gutenberg Parenthesis: Elizabethan-American Compatibilties'' https://www.academia.edu/2946207/Before_the_Gutenberg_Parenthesis_Elizabethan-American_Compatibilities&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by Professor Lars Ole Sauerberg. &lt;ref&gt;Pettitt, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; 

==McLuhan's Global Village==
In [[The Gutenberg Galaxy]], [[Marshall McLuhan]] discussed his notion of the "[[Global Village (term)|global village]]", a concept that can be related to Ong's account of secondary orality.  Liliana Bounegru notes the emergence of social media (e.g. [[Facebook]]) and microblogging (i.e.[[Twitter]]) are re-[[Tribalism|tribalizing]] our cultures.  Conversations in these social spaces are written, but are more conversational in tone than written communications; they are "rapid communication with large groups of people in a speed that would resemble oral storytelling, without having to share the same physical space with your audience." &lt;ref&gt;Bounegru, Liliana 'Secondary Orality in Microblogging' at Masters of Media. [http://mastersofmedia.hum.uva.nl/2008/10/13/secondary-orality-in-microblogging/]  Bounegru is Project Coordinator at the European Journalism Centre, Maastricht, NL and a MA candidate in Media Studies, University of Amsterdam.

In [[civil engineering]], '''specified loads''' are the best estimate of the actual loads a structure is expected to carry.  These loads come in many different forms, such as people, equipment, vehicles, wind, rain, snow, earthquakes, the building materials themselves, etc.  Specified Loads also known as Characteristic loads in many cases.

Buildings will be subject to loads from various sources. The principal ones can be classified as [[live load]]s (loads which are not always present in the structure), [[dead load]]s (loads which are permanent and immovable excepting redesign or renovation) and wind load, as described below. In some cases structures may be subject to other loads, such as those due to earthquakes or pressures from retained material. The expected maximum magnitude of each is referred to as the characteristic load.

Dead loads are those representing the self weight of the building; their magnitude can be estimated on the basis of material densities and component sizes.

Dead loads are those due to the self weight of the structure and any permanent fittings and finishes. It is generally possible to quantify the magnitude of dead loads with a reasonable degree of confidence.

Imposed loads are those associated with occupation and use of the building; their magnitude is less clearly defined and is generally related to the use of the building.

A good example of specified loads would be the following simplified [[floor to ceiling sandwich]] load table (based on the National Building Code of Canada standards):

Floor Finish ([[Terrazzo]]) per 10&amp;nbsp;mm thickness = 0.24&amp;nbsp;kN/m^2&lt;br&gt;
Reinforced Concrete per 110&amp;nbsp;mm thickness = 0.24&amp;nbsp;kN/m^2&lt;br&gt;
Mechanical Services = 0.14&amp;nbsp;kN/m^2&lt;br&gt;
Electrical Services = 0.10&amp;nbsp;kN/m^2

Floor Area (110&amp;nbsp;mm thickness) = 8 m^2

Total Dead Load = (0.24 + 11*0.24 + 0.14 + 0.10)*8 = 24.96&amp;nbsp;kN

In order to design to these loads, one would need to convert them to [[design load]]s by applying [[Load factor (real estate)|Load factor]]s or, more generally, a form of [[safety factor]]s to them.  In the case of limit states design, the resulting factored load is then called a [[Design load]].  Note that in this case of Limit states design, we would refer to the factor as a load factor rather than a safety factor to try to eliminate possible confusion between [[Limit states design]] and the older [[Allowable stress design]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17952">A '''subtropical climate vegetated roof''' ('''SCV roof''') is a type of [[green building]] practice that employs a planted soil media installed above a waterproof roof deck to obtain [[Environmental management|environmental]] benefits and address [[sustainability]] concerns, similar to traditional [[green roofs]] located in northern continental United States. Soil media, plant palettes, and green roof systems that can adapt to the adverse weather conditions and physical characteristics of the humid, subtropical regions of the United States are utilized in the construction and design of subtropical climate vegetated roofs.

Green roofs are used for various reasons including: [[urban oasis]], storm water mitigation, [[carbon reduction]], [[energy conservation]], aesthetics, and therapeutic values depending on the [[geographic location]] and the intended specific goals of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.igra-world.com/benefits/public_benefits.php|title= Public Benefits}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Most of the current green roof research pertains to northern parts of the continental United States, whereas, very limited research has been conducted in humid, subtropical regions.&lt;ref name="ufl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com.lp.hscl.ufl.edu/content/1250j6n7008p73pu/fulltext.pdf|title=Connecting From Off-Campus|publisher=University of Florida Libraries|accessdate=2014-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although similar characteristics and principles exist, there are several differences between the two types of environmentally sound roofing systems. These differences are comparable to the differences found between regions of the United States in conventional [[landscaping]] and gardening or the variations found in forms of landscaping. Plant species and landscaping methods utilized in northern parts of the United States are not suitable for humid, subtropical regions of United States due to the extreme temperatures and rain events that occur. This accounts for the most significant difference between a green roof in northern United States and a subtropical climate vegetated roof (SCV roof).

A subtropical climate vegetated roof that is well designed according to the specific geographic locations climate can lower roof surface temperatures by as much 38° and depending on the amount of the event retain up to 88% of rainfall.&lt;ref name="ufl"/&gt; An improperly designed subtropical climate vegetated (SCV roof) using incorrect soil media and plant species can fail by not achieving the intended goals.&lt;ref name="ufl"/&gt; This roofing method also contributes towards growing the [[green economy]], [[clean energy]] technology policies, and qualifies for Federal and local tax incentives, set in place by the United States government.

==Technology and terminology==

Compared with other parts of the United States, the number of vegetated roofs currently in the Southeast is significantly less. Vegetated roofs in humid subtropical regions rely on the same core green roof terminologies that are used throughout the world and other parts of the United States. Extensive, intensive, soil media, ballast, filter fabric, drainage layer, waterproof membrane are some of the core green roof component terms associated with SCV roofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.igra-world.com/engineering/vegetation_technology.php|title= Vegetation technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional terms, plant palettes, and technologies are forming to adapt to recent innovations and increased popularity of green roofs in the humid, subtropical regions of the United States. All forms of green roofs have the potential to retain [[stormwater]] on the roof surface and lower the [[thermal loading]] on buildings. Due to high temperatures, prolonged heat, and excessive amounts of precipitation, humid subtropical regions of the United States receive the greatest environmental benefits provided by SCV roofs, which are: reduced rainwater input into storm water retention systems during rainfall and increased energy performance ratings in buildings.&lt;ref name="ufl"/&gt; SCV and green roofs increase energy efficiencies of buildings by stabilizing roof surface temperatures. In other regions of the United States, the greatest environmental benefits of green roof design may be different based upon the type of [[climate]] the area possesses.

Recent advancements in soil engineering and plastic technologies allow vegetated roofs the ability to adapt to different locations within the humid, subtropical region of the United States. Soil media [[moisture content]] and capacity levels can be regulated by using soil elements that adapt to the climate of each specific geographic location and client needs. The amount of moisture retained depends on the maximum moisture retention capacity, the permeability and the depth of the soil media.&lt;ref name="ufl2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com.lp.hscl.ufl.edu/journals.htm?issn=0956-6163&amp;volume=13&amp;issue=4&amp;articleid=871400&amp;show=html&amp;PHPSESSID=2dhaso94ddmb4b04rlsb3lbrj4|title=Connecting From Off Campus - UF Libraries|publisher=emeraldinsight.com.lp.hscl.ufl.edu|accessdate=2014-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; High density plastics permit SCV roof systems to withstand the weather elements and adjust to varying building types of the region.

As defined by green roof industry standards, extensive green roofs have a soil media of less than 6 inches in depth and intensive green roofs have a soil media of more than 6 inches in depth.&lt;ref name="ufl3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buildgreen.ufl.edu/Fact_sheet_Green_Roofs_Eco_roofs.pdf|date=22 December 2008|title=Green Roofs/Eco-roofs|publisher=University of Florida|accessdate=2014-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most SCV roofs that are greater than 6 inches in depth are expensive and found on residential high rise structures, often containing [[Swimming pool|pool]]s and other amenities.

An SCV roofs requires a unique soil media mixture to adapt to the harsh [[weather conditions]] and physical characteristics of the southern United States. Expanded shall and [[clay]] are typically used to form a base and comprise up to 90% of some soil media mixtures used throughout the United States. [[Perlite]], [[vermiculite]], ash, tire crumbs, sand, [[peat moss]], and recycled vegetation are some of the other elements utilized in soil media engineering. [[Albedo]] and heat transfer rates are key variables to consider when designing an SCV roof and do not have a significant effect on green roofs in the northern continental United States.

There are three basic SCV and green roof systems available in today’s market: built-up, modular, and mat. These systems vary from manufacture to manufacture and are composed of different materials such as: [[foam]], high density plastic, and fabrics. Many of the systems have geographic limitations and do not perform well in humid, subtropical regions based upon the intent of the system and the materials being used.

==Built-up==

Multi-layered systems containing the following functional layers: [[root barrier]], protection layer, drainage layer, filter layer, growing medium and plant level.&lt;ref name=" Vegetation technology "&gt;Vegetation technology&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modular systems==

Self-contained units, typically square in shape, that require only the soil medium and vegetative layer for a functioning green roof. These systems are easy to install and remove. Some modular systems are pre-grown at nurseries to client specifications, forming an instant vegetative layer.&lt;ref name=" Vegetation technology "&gt;Vegetation technology&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mat systems==

Singled-layered systems of this type are drained by a multi-layer fabric mat called a “drainage mat” that combines soil separation, drainage, and protection functions. Current research suggests that the depth of the soil media, material, and amount of layers affect the success rate of an individual green or SCV roof.&lt;ref name=" Vegetation technology "&gt;Vegetation technology&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suitable plant pallets==

A suitable plant species for SCV roofs consist of the following features: drought tolerant, minimal root structure, minimal height, ability to form a vegetative mat, non-rangy, heat tolerant, [[frost]] tolerant, and the ability to adapt to a non-traditional soil media. Plant species that have extensive root system and tend to be rangy can puncture waterproofing elements or grow into unwanted areas causing [[mold]] and [[mildew]]. Water, high [[nutrient]], and [[shade (shadow)|shade]]-dependent plants are not suitable for SCV roofs and should be avoided and can lead to expensive failures.

Some of the most successful SCV roof plant species are in the [[Crassulaceae]] and [[Aizoaceae]] family which are CAM plants. A plant that uses the [[crassulacean acid metabolism]] (CAM) as an adaptation for arid conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/CAM_plant|title= CAM plant}}&lt;/ref&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; entering the stomata during the night is converted into [[organic acids]], which release [[CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] for the [[Calvin Cycle]] during the day, when the stomata are closed.&lt;ref name=" CAM plant "&gt;CAM plant&lt;/ref&gt; CAM plants often show [[xerophytic]] features, such as thick, reduced leaves with a low surface-area-to-volume ratio, thick cuticle, and [[stomata]] sunken into pits.&lt;ref name=" CAM plant "&gt;CAM plant&lt;/ref&gt;

Green roofs in the northern continental United States rely on [[Sedums]] which are in the Crassulaceae family. Most varieties of Sedums are not appropriate for humid, subtropical climates and experience root rot and disease problems due to high temperatures and humidity levels. However, two Sedum cultivars, ‘Lemon Coral’ and’ Florida Friendly Gold’ are currently{{When|date=March 2011}} being researched at the [[University of Florida]] and appear to be adapting to the humid, subtropical climate of [[Gainesville, Florida]].

==Challenges==

SCV roofs confront a magnitude of challenges due the adverse weather conditions of the Southeastern United States. High [[humidity]] levels, excessive rain amounts, prolonged heat, mold, mildew, insects, disease, weeds, soil borne disease, maintenance concerns, and sloped roofs are the major challenges faced in designing a SCV roof. High humidity levels, excessive rain amounts, prolonged heat lead to decreased plant health on CAM plants that are standard in green roof design. The decreased plant health causes diseases, insects, root rot, and plant fatality.

Soil-borne diseases occur more frequently due to warm, rainy, humid environment rhythm of the humid, subtropical region.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.lp.hscl.ufl.edu/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=KNktsuZMtboC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=soil+diseases+humid+subtropical+regions&amp;ots=RVN_l-UXUA&amp;sig=MUA4wZo4IVPddW6FS8KcNbyqwUA#v=onepage&amp;q=warm%2C%20rainy&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; SCV roof plants are researched and tested at several different universities throughout the southeast to avoid system failure and economic loses. Mold and mildew can form on areas of the roof and building when proper ventilation is not taken into consideration and are also repercussions of high humidity levels and prolonged heat.

One of the greatest challenges to SCV roofs can be [[hurricanes]]. The strong hurricane winds can cause uplifting of the roofs. High winds can scour the growth media where the plants are established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.greenroofs.com/content/greenroofguy003.htm|title= Green Roof Wind Uplift Challenges}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scouring is the blowing of the particles in the growth media from the surface of the vegetated roof, thereby reducing the volume and weight of growth media and its ability to [[ballast]] the green roof.&lt;ref name=" Green Roof Wind Uplift Challenges "&gt;Green Roof Wind Uplift Challenges&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloped roofs that are prevalent in the southeastern United States also pose a significant challenge for SCV roofs. Soil media [[erosion]] and poor plant establishment are the most common problems and can occur on any angle of sloped roof if not designed properly. Erosion blankets and green roof soil media stabilization products are used to mitigate the effects of sloped roofs. Flat roofs and low sloped roofs are conventional roof slopes by the building industry in the southeastern United States and allow for successful implementation of SCV roofs.

===Standard roof slopes===

Flat roofs – 1% to 2% slope

Low slope-3:12 to 5:12

Medium Slope-6:12 to 9:12

High Slope-10:12 to 12:12

;Subtropical regions in the US where SCV roofs could apply

Here are some of the states where humid subtropical climates can be found:
* Eastern half of Texas
* [[Louisiana]]
* [[Arkansas]]
* [[Alabama]]
* [[Mississippi]]
* [[North Carolina]]
* [[South Carolina]]
* [[Tennessee]]
* [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]
* [[Kentucky]]
* most of Florida
* [[Virginia]]
* southern [[West Virginia]]

The climate in many of these states can vary and be extreme.

'''Benefits (Performance ratings)'''
* Reduces stormwater volume (50%–85%)&lt;ref name="ufl3"/&gt;
* Improves stormwater quality through load reduction&lt;ref name="ufl3"/&gt;
* Saves water by [[rainwater harvesting]]&lt;ref name="ufl3"/&gt;
* Reduces [[heat island effect]]&lt;ref name="ufl3"/&gt;
* Lowers surface temperatures by 40–50 degrees [[Fahrenheit]]&lt;ref name="ufl3"/&gt;
* Energy savings can reach 15%–30%&lt;ref name="ufl3"/&gt;
* Reduces noise for building occupants&lt;ref name=" Public Benefits "&gt;Public Benefits&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increases the life of the roof and reduces roof maintenance&lt;ref name="ufl3"/&gt;
* Contributes to [[biodiversity]] and creates [[habitats]] for birds and [[invertebrates]]&lt;ref name=" Public Benefits "&gt;Public Benefits&lt;/ref&gt;
* Filters air pollutant particles&lt;ref name=" Public Benefits "&gt;Public Benefits&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increased storm event safety
* Neighborhood diversity
* Aesthetic value
* Reduces need for [[Retention basin|retention ponds]] and [[ditches]]

===Costs===

Initially, vegetated roofs can have a high short-term capital but the long-term energy and maintenance savings outweigh them. Even the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] and some new advances in green roofs suggest that green buildings don't necessarily have to cost more than a conventional one.

[[Lester R. Brown]], a prominent [[environmentalist]] and founder of the [[Worldwatch Institute]] and [[Earth Policy Institute]], describes sustainable living in the twenty-first century as "shifting to a renewable energy-based, reuse/recycle economy with a diversified transport system."&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Greg. [http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/lester-brown "An interview with Lester Brown"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227004714/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/lester-brown |date=27 December 2016 }} ''American Scientist''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Derrick Jensen]] ("the poet-philosopher of the [[ecological movement]]"), a celebrated American [[author]], [[radical environmentalist]] and prominent critic of [[Bright green environmentalism|mainstream environmentalism]] argues that "[[industrial civilization]] is not and can never be sustainable".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-22|title=Endgame (Derrick Jensen books)|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Endgame_(Derrick_Jensen_books)&amp;oldid=786893218|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this statement, the natural conclusion is that sustainable living is at odds with industrialization. Thus, practitioners of the philosophy potentially face the challenge of living in an industrial society and adapting alternative norms, technologies, or practices.

Additionally, practical [[ecovillage]] builders like [[Living Villages]] maintain that the shift to alternative technologies will only be successful if the resultant built environment is attractive to a local [[culture]] and can be maintained and adapted as necessary over multiple generations.

==Shelter==
[[Image:PA120016.JPG|thumb|right|240px|An example of ecological housing]]
On a global scale, shelter is associated with about 25% of the [[greenhouse gas]] emissions embodied in household purchases and 26% of households' [[land use]].&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Ivanova"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Environmental Impact Assessment of Household Consumption|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.12371/abstract|journal = Journal of Industrial Ecology|date = 2015-12-01|issn = 1530-9290|pages = 526–536|doi = 10.1111/jiec.12371|language = en|first = Diana|last = Ivanova|first2 = Konstantin|last2 = Stadler|first3 = Kjartan|last3 = Steen-Olsen|first4 = Richard|last4 = Wood|first5 = Gibran|last5 = Vita|first6 = Arnold|last6 = Tukker|first7 = Edgar G.|last7 = Hertwich|volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

[[Green building|Sustainable homes]] are built using sustainable methods, materials, and facilitate green practices, enabling a more sustainable lifestyle. Their construction and maintenance have neutral impacts on the Earth. Often, if necessary, they are close in proximity to essential services such as grocery stores, schools, daycares, work, or public transit making it possible to commit to sustainable transportation choices.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery, Yvonne, Michael Grosvenor, and Liz Barclay. ''Green Living for Dummies.'' Indianapolis, IN: Wiley Pub., 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, they are [[off-the-grid]] homes that do not require any public energy, water, or sewer service.

If not off-the-grid, sustainable homes may be linked to a grid supplied by a power plant that is using sustainable power sources, buying power as is normal convention. Additionally, sustainable homes may be connected to a grid, but generate their own electricity through renewable means and sell any excess to a utility. There are two common methods to approaching this option: net metering and double metering.&lt;ref name="McDilda, Diane Gow 2007"&gt;McDilda, Diane Gow. ''The Everything Green Living Book: Easy Ways to Conserve Energy, Protect Your Family's Health, and Help save the Environment.'' Avon, MA: Adams Media, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Net metering uses the common meter that is installed in most homes, running forward when power is used from the grid, and running backward when power is put into the grid (which allows them to “net“ out their total energy use, putting excess energy into the grid when not needed, and using energy from the grid during peak hours, when you may not be able to produce enough immediately). Power companies can quickly purchase the power that is put back into the grid, as it is being produced. Double metering involves installing two meters: one measuring electricity consumed, the other measuring electricity created. Additionally, or in place of selling their renewable energy, sustainable home owners may choose to bank their excess energy by using it to charge batteries. This gives them the option to use the power later during less favorable power-generating times (i.e.: night-time, when there has been no wind, etc.), and to be completely independent of the [[electrical grid]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;McDilda, Diane Gow. ''The Everything Green Living Book: Easy Ways to Conserve Energy, Protect Your Family's Health, and Help save the Environment''. Avon, MA: Adams Media, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainably designed (see [[Sustainable Design]]) houses &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/greenbuilding/2010/05/18/what-is-a-sustainable-home-a-truly-green-home/|title=What is a Sustainable Home?

The design of a sustainable shelter affords the options it has later (i.e.: using [[Passive solar building design|passive solar lighting and heating]], creating temperature buffer zones by adding porches, deep overhangs to help create favorable microclimates, etc.)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton, Andy 2009"&gt;Hamilton, Andy, and Dave Hamilton. ''The Self-sufficient-ish Bible: an Eco-living Guide for the 21st Century.'' London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sustainably constructed houses involve environmentally friendly management of waste building materials such as recycling and composting, use non-toxic and renewable, recycled, reclaimed, or low-impact production materials that have been created and treated in a sustainable fashion (such as using organic or water-based finishes), use as much locally available materials and tools as possible so as to reduce the need for transportation, and use low-impact production methods (methods that minimize effects on the environment).&lt;ref&gt;Snell, Clarke, and Tim Callahan.

Many materials can be considered a “green” material until its background is revealed. Any material that has used toxic or carcinogenic chemicals in its treatment or manufacturing (such as [[formaldehyde]] in glues used in woodworking), has traveled extensively from its source or manufacturer, or has been cultivated or harvested in an unsustainable manner might not be considered green. In order for any material to be considered green, it must be resource efficient, not compromise [[indoor air quality]] or [[water conservation]], and be energy efficient (both in processing and when in use in the shelter).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Resource efficiency can be achieved by using as much recycled content, reusable or recyclable content, materials that employ recycled or recyclable packaging, locally available material, salvaged or remanufactured material, material that employs resource efficient manufacturing, and long-lasting material as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/greenbuilding/Materials/ Green Building Materials: Sustainable Building.] CalRecycle.

===Sustainable building materials===
Some building materials might be considered "sustainable" by some definitions and under some conditions.  For example,  wood might be thought of as sustainable if it is grown using [[sustainable forest management]], processed using [[sustainable energy]].  delivered by [[sustainable transport]], etc.:  Under different conditions, however, it might not be considered as sustainable.  The following materials might be considered as sustainable under certain conditions, based on a [[Life-cycle assessment]].

[[Building insulation|Insulation]] of a sustainable home is important because of the energy it conserves throughout the life of the home. Well insulated walls and lofts using green materials are a must as it reduces or, in combination with a house that is well designed, eliminates the need for heating and cooling altogether. Installation of insulation varies according to the type of insulation being used. Typically, lofts are insulated by strips of insulating material laid between rafters. Walls with cavities are done in much the same manner. For walls that do not have cavities behind them, solid-wall insulation may be necessary which can decrease internal space and can be expensive to install.&lt;ref name="Hamilton, Andy 2009"/&gt; Energy-efficient windows are another important factor in insulation. Simply assuring that windows (and doors) are well sealed greatly reduces energy loss in a home.&lt;ref name="McDilda, Diane Gow 2007"/&gt;  Double or Triple glazed windows are the typical method to insulating windows, trapping gas or creating a vacuum between two or three panes of glass allowing heat to be trapped inside or out.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; [[Low-emissivity]] or Low-E glass is another option for window insulation. It is a coating on windowpanes of a thin, transparent layer of metal oxide and works by reflecting heat back to its source, keeping the interior warm during the winter and cool during the summer. Simply hanging heavy-backed curtains in front of windows may also help their insulation.&lt;ref name="Hamilton, Andy 2009"/&gt; “Superwindows,” mentioned in [[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]], became available in the 1980s and use a combination of many available technologies, including two to three transparent low-e coatings, multiple panes of glass, and a heavy gas filling. Although more expensive, they are said to be able to insulate four and a half times better than a typical double-glazed windows.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul, Amory B. Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins. ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the next Industrial Revolution.'' Boston: Little, Brown and, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Equipping roofs with highly reflective material (such as aluminum) increases a roof's [[albedo]] and will help reduce the amount of heat it absorbs, hence, the amount of energy needed to cool the building it is on. [[Green roofs]] or “living roofs” are a popular choice for thermally insulating a building. They are also popular for their ability to catch storm-water runoff and, when in the broader picture of a community, reduce the heat island effect (see [[urban heat island]]) thereby reducing energy costs of the entire area. It is arguable that they are able to replace the physical “footprint” that the building creates, helping reduce the adverse environmental impacts of the building‘s presence.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlip, Jamie.

Energy efficiency and water conservation are also major considerations in sustainable housing. If using appliances, computers, [[HVAC]] systems, electronics, or lighting the sustainable-minded often look for an [[Energy Star]] label, which is government-backed and holds stricter regulations in energy and water efficiency than is required by law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=products.pr_how_earn How a Product Earns the ENERGY STAR Label : ENERGY STAR."] ENERGY STAR.

Mono Lake Committee. Web. 27 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greywater]], including water from washing machines, sinks, showers, and baths may be reused in landscape irrigation and toilets as a method of water conservation. Likewise, [[rainwater harvesting]] from storm-water runoff is also a sustainable method to conserve water use in a sustainable shelter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/natres/06702.html Graywater Reuse and Rainwater Harvesting].

As mentioned under Shelter, some sustainable households may choose to produce their own renewable energy, while others may choose to purchase it through the grid from a power company that harnesses sustainable sources (also mentioned previously are the methods of metering the production and consumption of electricity in a household). Purchasing sustainable energy, however, may simply not be possible in some locations due to its limited availability. 6 out of the 50 states in the US do not offer green energy, for example. For those that do, its consumers typically buy a fixed amount or a percentage of their monthly consumption from a company of their choice and the bought green energy is fed into the entire national grid. Technically, in this case, the green energy is not being fed directly to the household that buys it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/home-garden/news/2007/07/buy-green-power-and-electricity-to-help-the-environment/overview/0707_buying_green_power_ov.htm Buy Green Power and Electricity to Help the Environment]. Consumer Reports: Expert Product Reviews and Product Ratings from Our Test Labs. Consumers Union of U.S., July 2007. Web. 28 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, it is possible that the amount of green electricity that the buying household receives is a small fraction of their total incoming electricity. This may or may not depend on the amount being purchased. The purpose of buying green electricity is to support their utility’s effort in producing sustainable energy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Hamilton, Andy, and Dave Hamilton. The Self-sufficient-ish Bible: an Eco-living Guide for the 21st Century. London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Producing sustainable energy on an individual household or community basis is much more flexible, but can still be limited in the richness of the sources that the location may afford (some locations may not be rich in renewable energy sources while others may have an abundance of it).

When generating renewable energy and feeding it back into the grid (in participating countries such as the US and Germany), producing households are typically paid at least the full standard electricity rate by their utility and are also given separate renewable energy credits that they can then sell to their utility, additionally (utilities are interested in buying these renewable energy credits because it allows them to claim that they produce renewable energy). In some special cases, producing households may be paid up to four times the standard electricity rate, but this is not common.&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith, Kate.

[[File:Solar panels in Ogiinuur.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An installation of [[solar panel]]s in rural Mongolia]]

Solar power harnesses the energy of the sun to make electricity. Two typical methods for converting solar energy into electricity are [[Solar cells|photo-voltaic cells]] that are organized into panels and [[concentrated solar power]], which uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight to either heat a fluid that runs an [[electrical generator]] via a [[steam turbine]] or [[heat engine]], or to simply cast onto photo-voltaic cells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/csp_program.html Solar Energy Technologies Program: Concentrating Solar Power]. Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy. US Department of Energy, 19 October 2010. Web. 31 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;McDilda, Diane Gow. The Everything Green Living Book: Easy Ways to Conserve Energy, Protect Your Family's Health, and Help save the Environment. Avon, MA: Adams Media, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The energy created by photo-voltaic cells is a [[direct current]] and has to be converted to [[alternating current]] before it can be used in a household. At this point, users can choose to either store this direct current in batteries for later use, or use an AC/DC inverter for immediate use. To get the best out of a solar panel, the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] of the sun should be between 20 and 50 degrees. Solar power via photo-voltaic cells are usually the most expensive method to harnessing renewable energy, but is falling in price as technology advances and public interest increases. It has the advantages of being portable, easy to use on an individual basis, readily available for government grants and incentives, and being flexible regarding location (though it is most efficient when used in hot, arid areas since they tend to be the most sunny).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; For those that are lucky, affordable rental schemes may be found.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Concentrated solar power plants are typically used on more of a community scale rather than an individual household scale, because of the amount of energy they are able to harness but can be done on an individual scale with a [[parabolic reflector]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeffery, Yvonne 2008"&gt;Jeffery, Yvonne, Michael Grosvenor, and Liz Barclay. Green Living for Dummies. Indianapolis, IN: Wiley Pub., 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solar thermal energy]] is harnessed by collecting direct heat from the sun. One of the most common ways that this method is used by households is through [[solar water heating]]. In a broad perspective, these systems involve well insulated tanks for storage and collectors, are either passive or active systems (active systems have pumps that continuously circulate water through the collectors and storage tank) and, in active systems, involve either directly heating the water that will be used or heating a non-freezing heat-transfer fluid that then heats the water that will be used. Passive systems are cheaper than active systems since they do not require a pumping system (instead, they take advantage of the natural movement of hot water rising above cold water to cycle the water being used through the collector and storage tank).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=12850 Energy Savers: Solar Water Heaters]. Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy. US Department of Energy, 20 October 2010. Web. 28 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods of harnessing solar power are [[Solar combisystem|solar space heating]] (for heating internal building spaces), solar drying (for drying wood chips, fruits, grains, etc.), [[solar cookers]], [[Solar distillation|solar distillers]], and other [[passive solar]] technologies (simply, harnessing sunlight without any mechanical means).

Wind power is harnessed through turbines, set on tall towers (typically 20’ or 6m with 10‘ or 3m diameter blades for an individual household‘s needs) that power a generator that creates electricity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; They typically require an average of wind speed of 9&amp;nbsp;mi/hr (14&amp;nbsp;km/hr) to be worth their investment (as prescribed by the US Department of Energy), and are capable of paying for themselves within their lifetimes. Wind turbines in urban areas usually need to be mounted at least 30’ (10m) in the air to receive enough wind and to be void of nearby obstructions (such as neighboring buildings). Mounting a wind turbine may also require permission from authorities. Wind turbines have been criticized for the noise they produce, their appearance, and the argument that they can affect the migratory patterns of birds (their blades obstruct passage in the sky). Wind turbines are much more feasible for those living in rural areas&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; and are one of the most cost-effective forms of renewable energy per kilowatt, approaching the cost of fossil fuels, and have quick paybacks.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

For those that have a body of water flowing at an adequate speed (or falling from an adequate height) on their property, [[hydroelectricity]] may be an option. On a large scale, hydroelectricity, in the form of dams, has adverse environmental and social impacts. When on a small scale, however, in the form of single turbines, hydroelectricity is very sustainable. Single water turbines or even a group of single turbines are not environmentally or socially disruptive. On an individual household basis, single turbines are the probably the only economically feasible route (but can have high paybacks and is one of the most efficient methods of renewable energy production). It is more common for an eco-village to use this method rather than a singular household.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Geothermal energy production involves harnessing the hot water or steam below the earth’s surface, in reservoirs, to produce energy. Because the hot water or steam that is used is reinjected back into the reservoir, this source is considered sustainable. However, those that plan on getting their electricity from this source should be aware that there is controversy over the lifespan of each geothermal reservoir as some believe that their lifespans are naturally limited (they cool down over time, making geothermal energy production there eventually impossible). This method is often large scale as the system required to harness geothermal energy can be complex and requires deep drilling equipment. There do exist small individual scale geothermal operations, however, which harness reservoirs very close to the Earth’s surface, avoiding the need for extensive drilling and sometimes even taking advantage of lakes or ponds where there is already a depression. In this case, the heat is captured and sent to a [[geothermal heat pump]] system located inside the shelter or facility that needs it (often, this heat is used directly to warm a greenhouse during the colder months).&lt;ref name="Jeffery, Yvonne 2008"/&gt; Although geothermal energy is available everywhere on Earth, practicality and cost-effectiveness varies, directly related to the depth required to reach reservoirs. Places such as the Philippines, Hawaii,  Alaska, Iceland, California, and Nevada have geothermal reservoirs closer to the Earth’s surface, making its production cost-effective.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

Biomass power is created when any biological matter is burned as fuel. As with the case of using green materials in a household, it is best to use as much locally available material as possible so as to reduce the carbon footprint created by transportation. Although burning biomass for fuel releases [[carbon dioxide]], sulfur compounds, and nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere, a major concern in a sustainable lifestyle, the amount that is released is sustainable (it will not contribute to a rise in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere). This is because the biological matter that is being burned releases the same amount of carbon dioxide that it consumed during its lifetime.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; However, burning [[biodiesel]] and bioethanol (see [[biofuel]]) when created from virgin material, is increasingly controversial and may or may not be considered sustainable because it inadvertently increases global poverty, the clearing of more land for new agriculture fields (the source of the biofuel is also the same source of food), and may use unsustainable growing methods (such as the use of environmentally harmful pesticides and fertilizers).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lester Russell. Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to save Civilization. New York: W.W. Norton, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Digestion of organic material to produce methane is becoming an increasingly popular method of biomass energy production. Materials such as waste sludge can be digested to release methane gas that can then be burnt to produce electricity. Methane gas is also a natural by-product of landfills, full of decomposing waste, and can be harnessed here to produce electricity as well. The advantage in burning methane gas is that is prevents the methane from being released into the atmosphere, exacerbating the greenhouse effect. Although this method of biomass energy production is typically large scale (done in landfills), it can be done on a smaller individual or community scale as well.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

==Food==
Globally, food accounts for 48% and 70% of household environmental impacts on land and water resources respectively, with consumption of meat, dairy and processed food rising quickly with income&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Ivanova"/&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Environmental impacts of industrial agriculture===

[[Industrial agriculture|Industrial agricultural production]] is highly resource and energy intensive.  Industrial agriculture systems typically require heavy [[irrigation]], extensive [[Pesticide application|pesticide]] and [[Fertilizer|fertilizer application]], intensive [[tillage]], concentrated [[monoculture]] production, and other continual inputs. As a result of these industrial farming conditions, today’s mounting environmental stresses are further exacerbated. These stresses include: declining [[water table]]s, chemical [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], chemical [[Surface runoff|runoff]], [[soil erosion]], [[land degradation]], loss in [[biodiversity]], and other ecological concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lester R. ''Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization''. W.W. Norton, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conventional food distribution and long distance transport===

[[Conventional]] food distribution and long distance transport are additionally [[resource]] and [[energy]] exhaustive.  Substantial climate-disrupting [[carbon emissions]], boosted by the transport of food over long distances, are of growing concern as the world faces such [[global crisis]] as [[natural resource]] depletion, [[peak oil]] and [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinberg, Richard. ''Powerdown: Options and Actions for a Post-Carbon World''. Canada: New Society Publishers, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; “The average American meal currently costs about 1500 miles, and takes about 10 [[calorie]]s of oil and other [[fossil fuel]]s to produce a single calorie of food.”&lt;ref name="Astyk, Sharon 2008"&gt;Astyk, Sharon. ''Depletion and Abundance: Life on the New Home Front''. Canada: New Society Publishers,  2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local and seasonal foods===

A more sustainable means of acquiring food is to purchase locally and seasonally. Buying food from local farmers reduces [[carbon output]], caused by long-distance food transport, and stimulates the local economy.&lt;ref name="Astyk, Sharon 2008"/&gt; Local, small-scale farming operations also typically utilize more sustainable methods of agriculture than conventional industrial farming systems such as decreased tillage, [[nutrient cycling]], fostered biodiversity and reduced chemical pesticide and fertilizer applications.&lt;ref name="Shiva, Vandana 2000"&gt;Shiva, Vandana. ''Stolen Harvest: The Hijacking of the Global Food Supply''. Cambridge, MA: South End Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Adapting a more regional, seasonally based diet is more sustainable as it entails purchasing less energy and resource demanding produce that naturally grow within a local area and require no long-distance transport. These vegetables and fruits are also grown and harvested within their suitable [[growing season]]. Thus, [[seasonal food]] farming does not require energy intensive [[greenhouse]] production, extensive irrigation, plastic packaging and long-distance transport from importing non-regional foods, and other environmental stressors.&lt;ref name="Seymour, John 2003"&gt;Seymour, John. ''The Self-Sufficient Life and How to Live It''. London: DK Publishing, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Local, seasonal produce is typically fresher, unprocessed and argued to be more nutritious. Local produce also contains less to no chemical residues from applications required for long-distance shipping and handling.&lt;ref&gt;Princen, Thomas. ''The Logic of Sufficiency''. New York: MIT Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Farmers' market]]s, public events where local small-scale farmers gather and sell their produce, are a good source for obtaining local food and knowledge about local farming productions.  As well as promoting localization of food, farmers markets are a central gathering place for community interaction.&lt;ref name="Todd, J 1994"&gt;Todd, J. and N. J. Todd. ''From Eco-Cities to Living Machines: Principles of Ecological Design''. Berkeley, CA:  North Atlantic Books, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another way to become involved in regional food distribution is by joining a local [[community-supported agriculture]] (CSA). A CSA consists of a community of growers and consumers who pledge to support a farming operation while equally sharing the risks and benefits of food production. CSA's usually involve a system of weekly pick-ups of locally farmed vegetables and fruits, sometimes including dairy products, meat and special food items such as baked goods.&lt;ref&gt;Nabhan, Gary. ''Coming Home to Eat''. Berkeley, CA: W.W. Norton, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the previously noted rising environmental crisis, the United States and much of the world is facing immense vulnerability to famine. Local food production ensures food security if potential transportation disruptions and climatic, economical, and sociopolitical disasters were to occur.&lt;ref name="Astyk, Sharon 2008"/&gt;

===Reducing meat consumption===

Industrial meat production also involves high environmental costs such as [[land degradation]], [[soil erosion]] and depletion of [[natural resource]]s, especially pertaining to water and food.&lt;ref name="Seymour, John 2003"/&gt; Mass meat production increase the amount of [[Atmospheric methane|methane in the atmosphere]].  For more information on the [[environmental impact of meat production]] and consumption, see the [[ethics of eating meat]]. Reducing meat consumption, perhaps to a few meals a week, or adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, alleviates the demand for environmentally damaging industrial meat production. Buying and consuming organically raised, [[free range]] or [[Grass fed|grass fed meat]] is another alternative towards more sustainable meat consumption.&lt;ref name="Shiva, Vandana 2000"/&gt;

===Organic farming===

Purchasing and supporting organic products is another fundamental contribution to sustainable living. [[Organic farming]] is a rapidly emerging trend in the food industry and in the web of sustainability. According to the [[USDA]] [[National Organic Standards Board]] (NOSB), [[organic agriculture]] is defined as "an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore, maintain, or enhance ecological harmony. The primary goal of organic agriculture is to optimize the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life, plants, animals and people." Upon sustaining these goals, organic agriculture uses techniques such as [[crop rotation]], [[permaculture]], [[compost]], [[green manure]] and [[biological pest control]]. In addition, organic farming prohibits or strictly limits the use of manufactured fertilizers and pesticides, [[plant growth regulators]] such as [[hormones]], livestock [[antibiotics]], [[food additives]] and [[genetically modified organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/organicag/whatis.html Organic Agriculture - What is Organic Agriculture?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018130008/http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/organicag/whatis.html |date=18 October 2010 }} Iowa State University. 2008. Web. Retrieved on: 18 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Organically farmed products include vegetables, fruit, grains, herbs, meat, dairy, eggs, fibers, and flowers. See [[organic certification]] for more information.

===Urban gardening===
[[File:Ganjiaxiang - edible landscaping - P1070640.JPG|thumb|"Edible landscaping": a vegetable garden incorporated by the local residents into a roadside park. [[Qixia District]], [[Nanjing]], China]]
In addition to local, small-scale farms, there has been a recent emergence in [[urban agriculture]] expanding from [[community gardens]] to private [[home gardens]]. With this trend, both farmers and ordinary people are becoming involved in [[food production]]. A network of urban farming systems helps to further ensure regional food security and encourages self-sufficiency and cooperative interdependence within communities.&lt;ref&gt;Flores, H.C. ''Food Not Lawns: How to Turn Your Yard into a Garden and Your Neighborhood into a Community''. New York: Chelsea Green, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; With every bite of food raised from urban gardens, negative environmental impacts are reduced in numerous ways. For instance, vegetables and fruits raised within small-scale gardens and farms are not grown with tremendous applications of [[nitrogen fertilizer]] required for industrial agricultural operations. The nitrogen fertilizers cause toxic chemical leaching and runoff that enters our water tables. Nitrogen fertilizer also produces [[nitrous oxide]], a more damaging [[greenhouse gas]] than [[carbon dioxide]]. Local, community-grown food also requires no imported, long-distance transport which further depletes our [[fossil fuel]] reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Nyerges, Christopher. ''Urban Wilderness: a guidebook to resourceful city living''. Culver, CA: Peace Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; In developing more efficiency per land acre, urban gardens can be started in a wide variety of areas: in vacant lots, public parks, private yards, church and school yards, on roof tops ([[roof-top garden]]s), and many other places.  Communities can work together in changing zoning limitations in order for public and private gardens to be permissible.&lt;ref&gt;Hemenway, Toby. ''Gaia’s Garden''. New York: Chelsea Green, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetically pleasing [[edible landscaping]] plants can also be incorporated into city landscaping such as blueberry bushes, grapevines trained on an arbor, pecan trees, etc.&lt;ref name="Todd, J 1994"/&gt; With as small a scale as home or community farming, sustainable and organic farming methods can easily be utilized. Such sustainable, organic farming techniques include: [[composting]], [[biological pest control]], [[crop rotation]], [[mulching]], [[drip irrigation]], [[nutrient cycling]] and [[permaculture]].&lt;ref&gt;Warde, Jon, ed. ''The Backyard Builder: Over 150 Projects for Your Garden, Home and Yard''. New York:  Random House, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; For more information on sustainable farming systems, see [[sustainable agriculture]].

===Food preservation and storage===

Preserving and storing foods reduces reliance on long-distance transported food and the market industry. Home-grown foods can be preserved and stored outside of their growing season and continually consumed throughout the year, enhancing self-sufficiency and independence from the supermarket. Food can be preserved and saved by [[Dehydration (food)|dehydration]], [[Freezing (food)|freezing]], [[vacuum packing]], [[canning]], [[bottling]], [[pickling]] and jellying.&lt;ref&gt;Ciperthwaite, Wm. ''A Handmade Life: In Search of Simplicity''. New York: Chelsea Green, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; For more information, see [[food preservation]].

==Transportation==
{{main|Sustainable transport}}
[[File:20120623 ChevyVolt-Chicago-Compost.jpg|thumb|A [[carsharing]] [[plug-in hybrid]] vehicle being used to drop off [[compost]] at an urban facility in [[Chicago]].]]
With rising [[peak oil]] concerns, [[climate warming]] exacerbated by [[carbon emissions]] and high energy prices, the conventional [[automobile industry]] is becoming less and less feasible to the conversation of sustainability. Revisions of [[Public transport|urban transport]] systems that foster mobility, low-cost transportation and healthier urban environments are needed. Such urban transport systems should consist of a combination of [[rail transport]], [[bus transport]], [[bicycle]] pathways and [[pedestrian]] [[walkways]]. Public transport systems such as underground rail systems and bus transit systems shift huge numbers of people away from reliance on car [[mobilization]] and dramatically reduce the rate of carbon emissions caused by automobile transport.&lt;ref name="Brown, Lester R. 2009"&gt;Brown, Lester R. ''Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization''. New York: W.W. Norton, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carpooling]] is another alternative for reducing oil consumption and carbon emissions by transit.

In comparison to automobiles, bicycles are a paragon of energy efficient personal transportation with the bicycle roughly 50 times more energy efficient than driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/14/science/the-bicycle-and-the-ride-to-modern-america.html|title=The Bicycle and the Ride to Modern America|date=13 July 2015|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bicycles increase mobility while alleviating [[Traffic congestion|congestion]], lowering [[Air pollution|air]] and [[noise pollution]], and increasing [[physical exercise]]. Most importantly, they do not emit climate-disturbing [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Brown, Lester R. 2009"/&gt; [[Bike-sharing]] programs are beginning to boom throughout the world and are modeled in leading cities such as [[Paris]], [[Amsterdam]] and [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaheen|first=Susan|author2=Stacey Guzman|title=Worldwide Bikesharing|journal=Access Magazine|year=2011|url=http://uctc.net/access/39/access39_bikesharing.shtml|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326063609/http://www.uctc.net/access/39/access39_bikesharing.shtml|archivedate=26 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bike-sharing programs offer [[kiosks]] and docking stations that supply hundreds to thousands of bikes for rental throughout a city through small deposits or affordable memberships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaheen|first=Susan|author2=Guzman, S.|author3=H. Zhang|title=Bikesharing in Europe, the Americas, and Asia: Past, Present, and Future|journal=Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research|year=2010|url=http://76.12.4.249/artman2/uploads/1/Bikesharing_in_Europe__the_Americas__and_Asia.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610155608/http://76.12.4.249/artman2/uploads/1/Bikesharing_in_Europe__the_Americas__and_Asia.pdf|archivedate=10 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent boom has occurred in [[electric bicycles|electric bikes]] especially in China and other Asian countries. Electric bikes are similar to [[plug-in hybrid]] vehicles in that they are battery powered and can be plugged into the provincial [[electric grid]] for recharging as needed. In contrast to plug-in hybrid cars, electric bikes do not directly use any [[fossil fuels]].  Adequate sustainable urban transportation is dependent upon proper city [[infrastructure]] and planning that incorporates efficient public transit along with bicycle and pedestrian-friendly pathways.&lt;ref name="Brown, Lester R. 2009" /&gt;  Patrick Maria Johnson was the founder of this.

==Water==
{{Contradicts other|date=December 2013|1=Water efficiency}}
{{main|Water efficiency}}
A major factor of sustainable living involves that which no human can live without, [[water]]. Unsustainable water use has far reaching implications for humankind.  Currently, humans use one-fourth of the Earth’s total fresh water in natural circulation, and over half the accessible [[Surface runoff|runoff]].&lt;ref name="Hawken, Paul 1999"&gt;Hawken, Paul, Amory Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins. ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution''. New York City: Little, Brown and Company, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[population growth]] and water demand is ever increasing. Thus, it is necessary to use available water more efficiently. In sustainable living, one can use water more sustainably through a series of simple, everyday measures.  These measures involve considering indoor [[home appliance]] efficiency, outdoor water use, and daily water use awareness.

===Indoor home appliances===

Housing and [[commercial buildings]] account for 12 percent of America’s freshwater withdrawals.&lt;ref name="Hawken, Paul 1999"/&gt;  A typical American single family home uses about {{convert|70|USgal|L}} per person per day indoors.&lt;ref name="Hawken, Paul 1999"/&gt; This use can be reduced by simple alterations in behavior and upgrades to [[Home appliance|appliance]] quality.

====Toilets====

[[Toilets]] accounted for almost 30% of residential indoor water use in the United States in 1999.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/watersense/pubs/indoor.html Indoor Water Use in the United States] WaterSense: An EPA Partnership Program. US Environmental Protection Agency, 9 November 2010. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; One flush of a standard U.S. toilet requires more water than most individuals, and many families, in the world use for all their needs in an entire day.&lt;ref name="HawkenPaul"&gt;Hawken, Paul, Amory Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins. ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution.'' New York City: Little, Brown and Company, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
A home’s toilet water sustainability can be improved in one of two ways: improving the current toilet or installing a more efficient toilet.  To improve the current toilet, one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank.  Also, there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase.  A tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank. A [http://www.floatbooster.com/Product.html float booster] attaches underneath the float ball of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets.  It allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level, saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush.  A major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks.  A slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye, but can waste hundreds of gallons each month.  One way to check this is to put food dye in the tank, and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color.  In the event of a leaky flapper, one can replace it with an adjustable toilet flapper, which allows self-adjustment of the amount of water per flush.

If installing a new toilet there are a number of options to obtain the most water efficient model. A [[low flush toilet]] uses one to two gallons per flush.  Traditionally, toilets use three to five gallons per flush. If an eighteen-liter per flush toilet is removed and a six-liter per flush toilet is put in its place, 70% of the water flushed will be saved while the overall indoor water use by will be reduced by 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanbuildersnyc.com/Green_Building.html Green Building Health and Environmental Considerations in Building and Renovating Today] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130194906/http://urbanbuildersnyc.com/Green_Building.html |date=30 November 2010 }} Urban Builders Group. Urban Builders Group LTD. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to have a toilet that uses no water.  A [[composting toilet]] treats human waste through [[composting]] and [[dehydration]], producing a valuable soil additive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://compostingtoilet.org/compost_toilets_explained/what_is_a_composting_toilet/index.php What is a Composting Toilet?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120223832/http://compostingtoilet.org/compost_toilets_explained/what_is_a_composting_toilet/index.php |date=20 November 2010 }} Composting Toilet World. Envirolet. 2010. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  These toilets feature a two-compartment bowl to separate urine from feces.  The urine can be collected or sold as fertilizer.  The feces can be dried and bagged or composted.  These toilets cost scarcely more than regularly installed toilets and do not require a sewer hookup.  In addition to providing valuable fertilizer, these toilets are highly sustainable because they save sewage collection and treatment, as well as lessen agricultural costs and improve [[topsoil]].

Additionally, one can reduce toilet water sustainability by limiting total toilet flushing. For instance, instead of flushing small wastes, such as tissues, one can dispose of these items in the trash or compost.

====Showers====

On average, showers were 18% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999, at {{convert|6|-|8|USgal|L}} per minute traditionally in America.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; A simple method to reduce this use is to switch to low-flow, high-performance showerheads.  These showerheads use only 1.0-1.5 gpm or less. An alternative to replacing the showerhead is to install a converter. This device arrests a running shower upon reaching the desired temperature.  [[Solar water heater]]s can be used to obtain optimal water temperature, and are more sustainable because they reduce dependence on fossil fuels. To lessen excess water use, water pipes can be insulated with pre-slit foam pipe insulation. This insulation decreases hot water generation time. A simple, straightforward method to conserve water when showering is to take shorter showers.   One method to accomplish this is to turn off the water when it is not necessary (such as while lathering) and resuming the shower when water is necessary.  This can be facilitated when the plumbing or showerhead allow turning off the water without disrupting the desired temperature setting (common in the UK but not the United States).

====Dishwashers and sinks====

On average, sinks were 15% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; There are, however, easy methods to rectify excessive water loss. Available for purchase is a screw-on aerator. This device works by combining water with air thus generating a frothy substance with greater perceived volume, reducing water use by half. Additionally, there is a flip-valve available that allows flow to be turned off and back on at the previously reached temperature. Finally, a [[laminar flow]] device creates a 1.5-2.4 gpm stream of water that reduces water use by half, but can be turned to normal water level when optimal.

In addition to buying the above devices, one can live more sustainably by checking sinks for leaks, and fixing these links if they exist. According to the EPA, "A small drip from a worn faucet washer can waste 20 gallons of water per day, while larger leaks can waste hundreds of gallons".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; When washing dishes by hand, it is not necessary to leave the water running for rinsing, and it is more efficient to rinse dishes simultaneously.

On average, dishwashing consumes 1% of indoor water use.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; When using a [[dishwasher]], water can be conserved by only running the machine when it is full.  Some have a "low flow" setting to use less water per wash cycle. Enzymatic [[detergents]] clean dishes more efficiently and more successfully with a smaller amount of water at a lower temperature.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

====Washing machines====

On average, 23% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999 was due to clothes washing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In contrast to other machines, American [[washing machines]] have changed little to become more sustainable. A typical washing machine has a vertical-axis design, in which clothes are agitated in a tubful of water. Horizontal-axis machines, in contrast, put less water into the bottom of the rub and rotate clothes through it. These machines are more efficient in terms of soap use and clothing stability.

===Outdoor water use===

There are a number of ways one can incorporate a personal [[yard]], [[roof]], and [[garden]] in more sustainable living. While conserving water is a major element of sustainability, so is sequestering water.

====Conserving water====

In planning a yard and garden space, it is most sustainable to consider the plants, soil, and available water.  Drought resistant shrubs, plants, and grasses require a smaller amount of water in comparison to more traditional species.  Additionally, native plants (as opposed to herbaceous perennials) will use a smaller supply of water and have a heightened resistance to plant diseases of the area.  [[Xeriscaping]] is a technique that selects drought-tolerant plants and accounts for endemic features such as [[slope]], [[soil type]], and [[native plant]] range.  It can reduce landscape water use by 50 – 70%, while providing [[habitat]] space for wildlife.  Plants on slopes help reduce [[Surface runoff|runoff]] by slowing and absorbing accumulated rainfall.  Grouping plants by watering needs further reduces water waste.

After planting, placing a circumference of [[mulch]] surrounding plants functions to lessen [[evaporation]].  To do this, firmly press two to four inches of organic matter along the plant's dripline. This prevents [[water runoff]].   When watering, consider the range of sprinklers; watering paved areas is unnecessary.  Additionally, to conserve the maximum amount of water, watering should be carried out during early mornings on non-windy days to reduce water loss to evaporation.  Drip-irrigation systems and soaker hoses are a more sustainable alternative to the traditional sprinkler system.  Drip-irrigation systems employ small gaps at standard distances in a hose, leading to the slow trickle of water droplets which percolate the soil over a protracted period.  These systems use 30 – 50% less water than conventional methods.&lt;ref&gt;Pinkham, R. and Dyer, J., 1993: "Linking Water and Energy Savings in Irrigation," Rocky Mountain Institute Publication #A94-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Soaker hoses help to reduce water use by up to 90%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savingwater.org/docs/successwithsoakerhoses.pdf Soaker Hoses: Good for your Garden, Your Wallet, and Our Environment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011035501/http://www.savingwater.org/docs/successwithsoakerhoses.pdf |date=11 October 2010 }} Saving Water Partnership. Seattle and Participating Area Water Utilities. 2005. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  They connect to a garden hose and lay along the row of plants under a layer of mulch.  A layer of [[organic material]] added to the soil helps to increase its absorption and water retention; previously planted areas can be covered with [[compost]].

In caring for a lawn, there are a number of measures that can increase the sustainability of lawn maintenance techniques.  A primary aspect of lawn care is watering.  To conserve water, it is important to only water when necessary, and to deep soak when watering.  Additionally, a lawn may be left to go dormant, renewing after a dry spell to its original vitality.

====Sequestering water====

A common method of water sequestrations is [[rainwater harvesting]], which incorporates the collection and storage of rain.  Primarily, the rain is obtained from a roof, and stored on the ground in catchment tanks.  Water sequestration varies based on extent, cost, and complexity.   A simple method involves a single barrel at the bottom of a downspout, while a more complex method involves multiple tanks.  It is highly sustainable to use stored water in place of purified water for activities such as irrigation and flushing toilets.  Additionally, using stored rainwater reduces the amount of runoff [[pollution]], picked up from roofs and pavements that would normally enter streams through storm drains.  The following equation can be used to estimate annual water supply:

Collection area (square feet) × Rainfall (inch/year) / 12 (inch/foot) = Cubic Feet of Water/Year

Cubic Feet/Year × 7.43 (Gallons/Cubic Foot) = Gallons/year

Note, however, this calculation does not account for losses such as evaporation or leakage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandonline.com/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=182095 How to Manage Stormwater: Rain Barrels]. Stormwater Management for Clean Rivers. Environmental Services. Web. 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greywater]] systems function in sequestering used indoor water, such as laundry, bath and sink water, and filtering it for reuse.  Greywater can be reused in [[irrigation]] and toilet flushing.  There are two types of greywater systems: gravity fed manual systems and package systems.&lt;ref name="greenbuildingsupply1"&gt;[http://www.greenbuildingsupply.com/Public/Energy-WaterConservation/GreywaterSystems/index.cfm Greywater Systems: Reusing Bath, Laundry, and Sink Water to Conserve Fresh Water]. Green Building Supply. 2010. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The manual systems do not require electricity but may require a larger yard space.&lt;ref name="greenbuildingsupply1"/&gt;  The package systems require electricity but are self-contained and can be installed indoors.&lt;ref name="greenbuildingsupply1"/&gt;

==Waste==

As populations and resource demands climb, waste production contributes to [[Greenhouse gas#Greenhouse gas emissions|emissions]] of [[carbon dioxide]], leaching of hazardous materials into the soil and waterways, and [[methane emissions]].  In America alone, over the course of a decade, 500 trillion pounds of American resources will have been transformed into nonproductive wastes and gases.&lt;ref name="HawkenPaul" /&gt; Thus, a crucial component of sustainable living is being waste conscious.  One can do this by reducing waste, reusing commodities, and recycling.

There are a number of ways to reduce waste in sustainable living.  Two methods to reduce paper waste are canceling junk mail like [https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t credit card and insurance offers] and [http://www.dmachoice.org/ direct mail marketing] and changing monthly paper statements to paperless emails.  Junk mail alone accounted for 1.72 million tons of landfill waste in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catalogchoice.org/environmental-facts|title=CatalogChoice Mail Preference Service - Put an end to junk mail, catalogs, and phone books.|website=CatalogChoice Mail Preference Service|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method to reduce waste is to buy in bulk, reducing packaging materials. Preventing food waste can limit the amount of organic waste sent to landfills producing the powerful greenhouse gas methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthwormtechnologies.com/about-us/|title=Our Story|first=Earthworm|last=Technologies®|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of waste reduction involves being cognizant of purchasing excessive amounts when buying materials with limited use like cans of paint. Non-hazardous or less hazardous alternatives can also limit the toxicity of waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/recycle.htm Reduce] United States Environmental Protection Agency. 5 May 2010. Web 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

By reusing materials, one lives more sustainably by not contributing to the addition of waste to landfills. Reusing saves [[natural resources]] by decreasing the necessity of [[raw material]] extraction. For example, reusable bags can reduce the amount of waste created by grocery shopping eliminating the need to create and ship plastic bags and the need to manage their disposal and recycling or polluting effects.

[[Recycling]], a process that breaks down used items into raw materials to make new materials, is a particularly useful means of contributing to the renewal of goods.  Recycling incorporates three primary processes; collection and processing, manufacturing, and purchasing recycled products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/recycle.htm Wastes – Resource Conservation – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle] United States Environmental Protection Agency.  5 May 2010. Web 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  A natural example of recycling involves using food waste as compost to enrich the quality of soil, which can be carried out at home or locally with community [[composting]]. An offshoot of recycling, [[upcycling]], strives to convert material into something of similar or greater value in its second life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainabilitydictionary.com/u/upcycle.php UpCycle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112170212/http://www.sustainabilitydictionary.com/u/upcycle.php |date=12 November 2010 }} Sustainability Management. Presidio Graduate School. Web. 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; By integrating measures of reusing, reducing, and recycling one can effectively reduce personal waste and use materials in a more sustainable manner.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12587">The '''transmission-line matrix (TLM) method''' is a space and time discretising method for computation of [[electromagnetic fields]]. It is based on the [[analogy]] between the electromagnetic field and a mesh of [[transmission line]]s. The TLM method allows the computation of complex three-dimensional electromagnetic structures and has proven to be one of the most powerful time-domain methods along with the finite difference time domain ([[FDTD]]) method.

== Basic principle ==

[[File:SingleNode2DTLM.png|thumb|500px|right|2D TLM example: an incident voltage pulse in two consecutive scattering events.]] The TLM method is based on [[Huygens Principle|Huygens' model of wave propagation]] and scattering and the analogy between field propagation and transmission lines. Therefore, it considers the computational domain as a mesh of transmission lines, interconnected at nodes. In the figure on the right is considered a simple example of a 2D TLM mesh with a voltage pulse of amplitude 1 V incident on the central node. This pulse will be partially reflected and transmitted according to the transmission-line theory. If we assume that each line has a characteristic impedance &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, then the incident pulse sees effectively three transmission lines in parallel with a total impedance of &lt;math&gt;Z/3&lt;/math&gt;. The reflection coefficient and the transmission coefficient are given by

: &lt;math&gt;R = \frac{Z/3-Z}{Z/3+Z} = -0.5&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;T = \frac{2(Z/3)}{Z/3+Z} = 0.5&lt;/math&gt;

The energy injected into the node by the incident pulse and the total energy of the scattered pulses are correspondingly

: &lt;math&gt;E_I = vi\,\Delta t = 1 \left(1/Z\right)\Delta t = \Delta t/Z&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;E_S = \left[0.5^2+0.5^2+0.5^2+(-0.5)^2\right](\Delta t/Z) = \Delta t/Z&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the [[energy conservation law]] is fulfilled by the model.

The next scattering event excites the neighbouring nodes according to the principle described above. It can be seen that every node turns into a secondary source of spherical wave. These waves combine to form the overall waveform. This is in accordance with Huygens principle of light propagation.

In order to show the TLM schema we will use time and space discretisation. The time-step will be denoted with &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; and the space discretisation intervals with &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta z&lt;/math&gt;. The absolute time and space will therefore be &lt;math&gt;t = k\,\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x = l\,\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;y = m\,\Delta y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z = n\,\Delta z&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k=0,1,2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; is the time instant and &lt;math&gt;m,n,l&lt;/math&gt; are the cell coordinates. In case &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = \Delta y = \Delta z&lt;/math&gt; the value &lt;math&gt;\Delta l&lt;/math&gt; will be used, which is the [[lattice constant]]. In this case the following holds:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta t=\frac{\Delta l}{c_0},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; is the free space speed of light.

== The 2D TLM node ==

=== The scattering matrix of an 2D TLM node ===

[[File:SeriesTlmNode.png|thumb|400px|right|A 2D series TLM node]]
If we consider an electromagnetic field distribution in which the only non-zero components are &lt;math&gt;E_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_z&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. a TE-mode distribution), then Maxwell's equations in [[Cartesian coordinates]] reduce to

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial{H_z}}{\partial{y}} = \varepsilon\frac{\partial{E_x}}{\partial{t}}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;-\frac{\partial{H_z}}{\partial{x}} = \varepsilon\frac{\partial{E_y}}{\partial{t}}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial{E_y}}{\partial{x}}-\frac{\partial{E_x}}{\partial{y}} = -\mu\frac{\partial{H_z}}{\partial{t}}&lt;/math&gt;

We can combine these equations to obtain

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2H_z}{\partial{x}^2}+\frac{\partial^2{H_z}}{\partial{y}^2} = \mu\varepsilon\frac{\partial^2{H_z}}{\partial{t}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The figure on the right presents a structure referred to as a ''series node''. It describes a block of space dimensions &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta z&lt;/math&gt; that consists of four ports. &lt;math&gt;L'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; are the distributed inductance and capacitance of the transmission lines. It is possible to show that a series node is equivalent to a TE-wave, more precisely the mesh current ''I'', the ''x''-direction voltages (ports 1 and 3) and the ''y''-direction voltages (ports 2 and 4) may be related to the field components &lt;math&gt;H_z&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_y&lt;/math&gt;. If the voltages on the ports are considered, &lt;math&gt;L_x = L_y&lt;/math&gt;, and the polarity from the above figure holds, then the following is valid

: &lt;math&gt;-V_1+V_2+V_3-V_4 = 2L'\,\Delta l\frac{\partial{I}}{\partial{t}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = \Delta y = \Delta l&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;\left(V_3 - V_1\right)-\left(V_4-V_2\right) = 2L'\,\Delta l\frac{\partial I}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\left[E_x(y+\Delta y)-E_x(y)\right]\,\Delta x-[E_y(x+\Delta x)-E_y(x)]\Delta y = 2L'\,\Delta l\frac{\partial{I}}{\partial{t}}&lt;/math&gt;

and dividing both sides by &lt;math&gt;\Delta x \Delta y&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{E_x(y+\Delta y)-E_x(y)}{\Delta y}-\frac{E_y(x+\Delta x)-E_y(x)}{\Delta x} = 2L'\,\Delta l\frac{\partial{I}}{\partial{t}}\frac{1}{\Delta x \, \Delta y}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = \Delta y = \Delta z = \Delta l&lt;/math&gt; and substituting &lt;math&gt;I = H_z \,\Delta z&lt;/math&gt; gives

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta E_x}{\Delta y} - \frac{\Delta E_y}{\Delta x} = 2L'\frac{\partial H_z}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

This reduces to Maxwell's equations when &lt;math&gt;\Delta l \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, using the conditions across the capacitors on ports 1 and 4, it can be shown that the corresponding two other Maxwell equations are the following:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial{H_z}}{\partial{y}} = C'\frac{\partial{E_x}}{\partial{t}}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;-\frac{\partial{H_z}}{\partial{x}} = C'\frac{\partial{E_y}}{\partial{t}}&lt;/math&gt;

Having these results, it is possible to compute the scattering matrix of a shunt node. The incident voltage pulse on port 1 at time-step ''k'' is denoted as &lt;math&gt;_kV^i_1&lt;/math&gt;. Replacing the four line segments from the above figure with their [[Thevenin equivalent]] it is possible to show that the following equation for the reflected voltage pulse holds:

: &lt;math&gt;_kV^r_1 = 0.5\left(_kV^i_1 + _kV^i_2 + _kV^i_3 - _kV^i_4\right)&lt;/math&gt;

If all incident waves as well as all reflected waves are collected in one vector, then this equation may be written down for all ports in matrix form:

: &lt;math&gt;_k\mathbf{V}^r=\mathbf{S}_k\mathbf{V}^i&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;_k\mathbf{V}^i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;_k\mathbf{V}^r&lt;/math&gt; are the incident and the reflected pulse amplitude vectors.

For a series node the scattering matrix '''S''' has the following form

: &lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{S}=\frac12\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
1&amp; 1&amp; 1&amp; -1\\
1&amp; 1&amp; -1&amp; 1\\
1&amp; -1&amp; 1&amp; 1\\
-1&amp; 1&amp; 1&amp; 1
\end{array}
\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Connection between TLM nodes ===

[[File:2DTLMmes.png|272px|thumb|right|A 2D series TLM node]]
In order to describe the connection between adjacent nodes by a mesh of series nodes, look at the figure on the right. As the incident pulse in timestep ''k+1'' on a node is the scattered pulse from an adjacent node in timestep ''k'', the following connection equations are derived:

: &lt;math&gt;_{k+1}V^i_1(x,y)=_{k+1}V^r_3(x,y-1)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;_{k+1}V^i_2(x,y)=_{k+1}V^r_4(x-1,y)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;_{k+1}V^i_3(x,y)=_{k+1}V^r_1(x,y+1)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;_{k+1}V^i_4(x,y)=_{k+1}V^r_2(x+1,y)&lt;/math&gt;

By modifying the scattering matrix &lt;math&gt;\textbf{S}&lt;/math&gt; inhomogeneous and lossy materials can be modelled. By adjusting the connection equations it is possible to simulate different boundaries.

=== The shunt TLM node ===

Apart from the series node, described above there is also the ''shunt TLM node'', which represents a TM-mode field distribution. The only non-zero components of such wave are &lt;math&gt;H_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H_y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;E_z&lt;/math&gt;. With similar considerations as for the series node the scattering matrix of the shunt node can be derived.

== 3D TLM models ==

[[File:SymmetricCondensedNode.png|thumb|320px|right|A 3D symmetric condensed node]]
Most problems in electromagnetics require a three-dimensional grid. As we now have structures that describe TE and TM-field distributions, intuitively it seems possible to define a combination of shunt and series nodes providing a full description of the electromagnetic field. Such attempts have been made, but because of the complexity of the resulting structures they proved to be not very useful. Using the analogy that was presented above leads to calculation of the different field components at physically separated points. This causes difficulties in providing simple and efficient boundary definitions. A solution to these problems was provided by Johns in 1987, when he proposed the structure known as the '''symmetrical condensed node''' (SCN), presented in the figure on the right. It consists of 12 ports because two field polarisations are to be assigned to each of the 6 sides of a mesh cell.

The topology of the SCN cannot be analysed using Thevenin equivalent circuits. More general energy and charge conservation principles are to be used.

The electric and the magnetic fields on the sides of the SCN node number ''(l,m,n)'' at time instant ''k'' may be summarised in 12-dimensional vectors

: &lt;math&gt;_k\mathbf{E}_{l,m,n}=_k\left[E_1,E_2,\ldots,E_{11},E_{12}\right]^T_{l,m,n}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;_k\mathbf{H}_{l,m,n}=_k\left[H_1,H_2,\ldots,H_{11},H_{12}\right]^T_{l,m,n}&lt;/math&gt;

They can be linked with the incident and scattered amplitude vectors via

: &lt;math&gt;_k\mathbf{a}_{l,m,n} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{Z_F}}{_k\mathbf{E}}_{l,m,n}+\frac{\sqrt{Z_F}}{2}{_k\mathbf{H}}_{l,m,n}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;_k\mathbf{b}_{l,m,n}=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{Z_F}}{_k\mathbf{E}}_{l,m,n}-\frac{\sqrt{Z_F}}{2}{_k\mathbf{H}}_{l,m,n}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Z_F = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\varepsilon}}&lt;/math&gt; is the field impedance, &lt;math&gt;_k\mathbf{a}_{l,m,n}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of the amplitudes of the incident waves to the node, and &lt;math&gt;_k\mathbf{b}_{l,m,n}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of the scattered amplitudes. The relation between the incident and scattered waves is given by the matrix equation

: &lt;math&gt;_k\mathbf{b}_{l,m,n} = \mathbf{S}_k\mathbf{a}_{l,m,n}&lt;/math&gt;

The scattering matrix '''S''' can be calculated. For the symmetrical condensed node with ports defined as in the figure the following result is obtained

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S} = \left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
0&amp; \mathbf{S}_0&amp; \mathbf{S}^T_0\\
\mathbf{S}^T_0&amp; 0&amp; \mathbf{S}_0\\
\mathbf{S}_0&amp; \mathbf{S}^T_0&amp; 0
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where the following matrix was used

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}_0 = \frac{1}{2}\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
0&amp; 0&amp; 1&amp; -1\\
0&amp; 0&amp; -1&amp; 1\\
1&amp; 1&amp; 0&amp; 0\\
1&amp; 1&amp; 0&amp; 0
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

The connection between different SCNs is done in the same manner as for the 2D nodes.

'''Variation''' is a characteristic of language: there is more than one way of saying the same thing. Speakers may vary pronunciation ([[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]), word choice ([[lexicon]]), or morphology and syntax (sometimes called "[[grammar]]").&lt;ref name="Meecham2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Linguistics|last1=Meecham|first1=Marjory|last2=Rees-Miller|first2=Janie|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=2001|isbn=0-312-24738-9|editor1-last=O'Grady|editor1-first=William|edition=Fourth|chapter=Language in social contexts|editor2-last=Archibald|editor2-first=John|editor3-last=Aronoff|editor3-first=Mark|editor4-last=Rees-Miller|editor4-first=Janie}}&lt;/ref&gt; But while the diversity of variation is great, there seem to be boundaries on variation – speakers do not generally make drastic alterations in sentence word order or use novel sounds that are completely foreign to the language being spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Sociolinguistics|last=Wardhaugh|first=Ronald|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4051-3559-7|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language variation does not equate with language ungrammaticality, but speakers are still (often unconsciously) sensitive to what is and is not possible in their native tongue.

Variationists study how a language changes by observing it. This is accomplished by looking at authentic data. For example, variation is studied by looking at linguistic and social environments, then the data is analyzed as the change occurs.  Variation in research programs must be malleable due to the nature of language itself. This is because language is also fluid in transition and does not shift from one state to another instantaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Preston|first=Dennis R.|date=1993-06-01|title=Variation linguistics and SLA|journal=Second Language Research|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=153–172|doi=10.1177/026765839300900205|issn=0267-6583}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Language variation is a core concept in sociolinguistics. Sociolinguists investigate whether this linguistic variation can be attributed to differences in the ''social'' characteristics of the speakers using the language, but also investigate whether elements of the surrounding ''linguistic'' context promote or inhibit the usage of certain structures.

Studies of language variation and its correlation with [[Sociology|sociological]] categories, such as [[William Labov]]'s 1963 paper "The social motivation of a sound change," led to the foundation of sociolinguistics as a subfield of [[linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Labov |first=William |title=The social motivation of a sound change |doi=10.1080/00437956.1963.11659799|journal=Word |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=273–309 |year=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chambers |first=J.K. |title=Sociolinguistic Theory: Linguistic Variation and its Social Significance |publisher=Blackwell |year=2003 |isbn=0-631-22882-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although contemporary sociolinguistics includes other topics, language variation and change remains an important issue at the heart of the field.

== Sociolinguistic variables ==
Studies in the field of [[sociolinguistics]] typically take a sample population and interview them, assessing the realisation of certain sociolinguistic variables. Labov specifies the ideal sociolinguistic variable to
* be high in frequency,
* have a certain immunity from conscious suppression,
* be an integral part of larger structures, and
* be easily quantified on a linear scale.&lt;ref name="Labov662"&gt;Labov, William (1966), ''The Social Stratification of English in New York City'', Diss. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Phonetics|Phonetic]] variables tend to meet these criteria and are often used, as are morphosyntactic variables, [[morphophonological]] variables, and, more rarely, lexical variables. Examples for phonetic variables are: the frequency of the [[glottal stop]], the height or backness of a [[vowel]] or the realisation of word-endings. An example of a morphosyntactic variable is the frequency of negative concord (known colloquially as a [[double negative]]). Two well-known and frequently studied morphophonological variables are T/D deletion, the optional deletion of the sound /t/ or /d/ at the end of a word, as in "I kep' walking" (Wolfram 1969;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Walt. 1969. ''A Sociolinguistic Description of Detroit Negro Speech''. Washington, DC: Center for Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Labov et al. 1968&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William, Cohen, Paul, Robins, Clarence, &amp; Lewis, John. 1968. ''A Study of the Non-standard English of Negro and Puerto Rican Speakers in New York City''. Co-operative Research Report 3288, Vol. 1. Philadelphia: U.S. Regional Survey.&lt;/ref&gt;); and the [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#G-dropping|ING variable]], the optional pronunciation of ''-ing'' at the end of a word as ''-in''', as in "I kept walkin'" (e.g. Fisher 1958;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00437956.1958.11659655|pages=47–56|title=Social Influences on the Choice of a Linguistic Variant|journal=''word''|volume=14|year=2015|last1=Fischer|first1=John L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labov 1966/1982;&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William. 1966 [1982]. ''The Social Stratification of English in New York City''. Washington, DC: Center for Applied Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Trudgill 1974&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, Peter. 1974. ''The social differentiation of English in Norwich''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Analysis and methodology ==
Analyzing sociolinguistic variation often involves the use of statistical programs to handle its multi-variable nature. One essential part of the methodology is to count up the number of tokens of a particular variant and compare it to the number of times the variant ''could have'' occurred. This is called the "Principle of Accountability" in [[Sali Tagliamonte|Tagliamonte]] (2012). Comparing the tokens to the total number of words in a corpus or comparing one corpus to another leads to erroneous results.&lt;ref name=Tagliamonte2012&gt;Tagliamonte, Sali A. (2012). ''Variationist Sociolinguistics: Change, observation, interpretation''. UK: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19–21}} This count of the possible occurrences can be difficult at times because some variants alternate with zero (such as relative pronouns ''that'', ''who'', and zero).&lt;ref name=Tagliamonte2012 /&gt;{{rp|11–12}}

== Association with age ==
There are several different types of age-based variation one may see within a population. They are: vernacular of a subgroup with membership typically characterized by a specific age range, age-graded variation, and indications of linguistic change in progress.

One example of subgroup vernacular is the speech of street youth.  Just as street youth dress differently from the "norm", they also often have their own "language".  The reasons for this are the following: (1) To enhance their own cultural identity (2) To identify with each other, (3) To exclude others, and (4) To invoke feelings of fear or admiration from the outside world.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Strictly speaking, this is not truly age-based, since it does not apply to all individuals of that age bracket within the community. [[Age-graded variation]] is a stable variation which varies within a population based on age. That is, speakers of a particular age will use a specific linguistic form in successive generations. This is relatively rare. J.K. Chambers cites an example from southern Ontario, Canada where the name of the letter 'Z' varies.&lt;ref name="Chambers2"&gt;Chambers, J.K. (1995). ''Sociolinguistic Theory'', Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the English-speaking world pronounces it 'zed'; however, in the United States, it is pronounced 'zee'. A linguistic survey found that in 1979 two-thirds of the 12-year-olds in Toronto ended the recitation of the alphabet with the letter 'zee' where only 8% of the adults did so. Then in 1991, (when those 12-year-olds were in their mid-20s) a survey showed only 39% of the 20- to 25-year-olds used 'zee'. In fact, the survey showed that only 12% of those over 30 used the form 'zee'. This is hypothesized&lt;ref name="Chambers2" /&gt; to be tied to an American children's song frequently used to teach the alphabet. In this song, the rhyme scheme matches the letter Z with V 'vee', prompting the use of the American pronunciation. As the individual grows older, this marked form 'zee' is dropped in favor of the standard form 'zed'.&lt;ref name="Chambers2" /&gt;

People tend to use linguistic forms that were prevalent when they reached adulthood. So, in the case of linguistic change in progress, one would expect to see variation over a broader range of ages. [[William Bright]] provides an example taken from American English, where in certain parts of the country there is an ongoing merger of the vowel sounds in such pairs of words as 'caught' and 'cot'.&lt;ref name="Bright19972"&gt;Bright, William (1997). "Social Factors in Language Change." In Coulmas, Florian (ed) ''The Handbook of Sociolinguistics''. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; This merger used to be distinctive of the western United States, but since World War II, it has developed independently in two other regions: western Pennsylvania and southwestward, and the New England coast from Boston north.&lt;ref&gt;University of Pennsylvania. circa 2005. ''Phonological atlas of North America'', [http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/maps/Map1.html Map 1].&lt;/ref&gt;  Examining the speech across several generations of a single family, one would find the grandparents' generation would never or rarely merge these two vowel sounds; their children's generation may on occasion, particularly in quick or informal speech; while their grandchildren's generation would merge these two vowels uniformly. This is the basis of the [[apparent-time hypothesis]] where age-based variation is taken as an indication of linguistic change in progress.

== Association with geography ==
{{Main|Dialectology}}
A commonly studied source of variation is regional dialects. [[Dialectology]] studies variations in language based primarily on geographic distribution and their associated features. Sociolinguists concerned with grammatical and phonological features that correspond to regional areas are often called dialectologists.

== Association with gender ==
{{Main|Language and gender}}
Men and women, on average, tend to use slightly different language styles. These differences tend to be quantitative rather than qualitative. That is, to say that women use a particular speaking style more than men do is akin to saying that men are taller than women (i.e., men are on average taller than women, but some women are taller than some men).

The initial identification of a ''women's register'' was by [[Robin Lakoff]] in 1975, who argued that the style of language served to maintain women's (inferior) role in society ("female deficit approach").&lt;ref name="Lakoff2"&gt;Lakoff, R.  (1975).  ''Language and Women’s Place''.  New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt; A later refinement of this argument was that gender differences in language reflected a power difference ("dominance theory").&lt;ref name="OBarr2"&gt;O’Barr, William and Bowman Atkins. (1980) "'Women’s Language' or 'powerless language'?" In McConnell-Ginet et al. (eds) ''Women and languages in Literature and Society.'' pp. 93-110. New York: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt; However, both these perspectives have the language style of men as normative, implying that women's style is inferior.

More recently, [[Deborah Tannen]] has compared gender differences in language as more similar to 'cultural' differences ("cultural difference approach"). Comparing conversational goals, she argued that men have a ''[[report]]'' style, aiming to communicate factual information, whereas women have a ''[[rapport]]'' style, more concerned with building and maintaining relationships.&lt;ref name="Tannen912"&gt;Tannen, Deborah. (1991). ''You Just Don’t Understand: Women and Men in Conversation.'' London: Virago.&lt;/ref&gt;

People tend to [[Communication Accommodation Theory|accommodate]] their language towards the style of the person they are interacting with. Thus, in a mixed-gender group, gender differences tend to be less pronounced. A similarly important observation is that this accommodation is usually towards the language style, not the gender of the person . That is, a polite and empathic male will tend to be accommodated to on the basis of their being polite and empathic, rather than their being male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00329|pages=171–175|title=Where is the Gender in Gendered Language?|journal=Psychological Science|volume=12|issue=2|year=2016|last1=Thomson|first1=Rob|last2=Murachver|first2=Tamar|last3=Green|first3=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Original research section|date=December 2017}}

'''''African American English (AAE)'''''

Communities of African Americans and Whites have been popular{{To whom?|date=December 2017}} groups with particular attention to their linguistic variation. This variation helps inform much about the origins and evolution of other varieties, especially African American English.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fix|first1=Sonya|date=2014|title=AAE as a bounded ethnolinguistic resource for white women with African American ties|journal=Language &amp; Communication|volume=35|pages=55–74|doi=10.1016/j.langcom.2013.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=how does it help inform?|date=December 2017}} Understanding the sociohistorical background of the settlement of the southern colonies is a crucial{{To whom?|date=December 2017}} step in understanding the origins of AAE.&lt;ref name=":1222"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of African American Language|last=Lanehart|first=Sonja|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-19-979539-0|location=New York|pages=1–895}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[African American English]] and [[Southern American English|Southern White American English]] both had origins in the British settler dialects introduced into the South within the colonial period (1607 and 1776).&lt;ref name=":1222" /&gt; With time these two varieties continued to evolve and influences one another. However, research on African American English did not become continuously and overwhelming explored until the 1960s and 1970s with many linguists including [[Robbins Burling]], [[Ralph Fasold]], [[Joey Dillard]], [[William Labov]], Williams Stewart, [[Geneva Smitherman]], and [[Walt Wolfram]] to name a few.&lt;ref name=":1222" /&gt; While African American English is still not considered an official variety by the dominant culture and educational system in the United States, it is a legitimate and verified variety by many scholars. The Ebonics Controversy help to influence the way America thinks about African American English. In December 1996 the Ebonics Controversy erupted from the Oakland School Board's resolution to identify [[African American Vernacular English|Ebonics]] as the first language of African American students and take it into account in their Language Arts lessons{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. There have been many different perspectives{{Vague|date=December 2017}} to engaging with African American English as a variety. Although there is some evidence that linguistically sensitive approaches are helpful, there are gaps in and questions about these approaches which require new research{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. However, AAE is a rule-governed, valid language variety that adequately and uniquely expresses the collective experiences of its speakers.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shollenbarger|first=Amy|date=2017|title=How African American English-Speaking First Graders Segment and Rhyme Words and Nonwords With Final Consonant Clusters|doi=10.1044/2017_LSHSS-16-0062|journal=Language, Speech &amp; Hearing Services in Schools|volume=48|issue=4|pages=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Asian English'''''

Very little attention has been paid to Asian American speech despite the rise in [[Asian Americans|Asian American]] immigrants to the United States.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Wolfram, W., &amp; Schilling-Estes, N. (2005). American English: Dialects and variation. Malden, Mass: Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Fought, Carmen. (2006). Language and Ethnicity. Cambridge,. UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Asian Americans are perceived as a distinct racial group, their speech has not been categorized as an individualized ethnolect. Asian Americans in particular have been seen as the “[[model minority]]”,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Kim, P. S., &amp; Lewis, G.B. 1994. “Asian-Americans in the Public-Service: Success, Diversity, and Discrimination.” Public Administration Review 54 (3): 285–90.&lt;/ref&gt; in which they are stereotyped as being comparable to whites in academic achievement and economic success. However, this assumption neglects Asian Americans who are less fortunate and may experience poverty. Furthermore, the term “Asian Americans” cover a vast diaspora of individuals from various national and ethnic origins (Koreans, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Hmong, etc.). However, this is a group in which “the dominant ideology treats as a single entity".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The homogenization of Asian Americans is problematic due to their distinct cultural and national backgrounds as well as history of immigration to the U.S. Therefore, research on Asian American speech is often homogenized because of racial homogenization. Research on Asian Americans in particular have noted the variation of Asian American speech.

'''''The Coming Race''''' is a novel by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], published anonymously in 1871. It has also been published as '''''Vril, the Power of the Coming Race'''''.
 
Some readers have believed the account of a superior subterranean [[master race]] and the energy-form called "Vril", at least in part; some [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophists]], notably [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[William Scott-Elliot]], and [[Rudolf Steiner]], accepted the book as based on occult truth, in part.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 55–123.&lt;/ref&gt; One 1960 book, ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'', suggested that a [[Secret society|secret]] '''Vril Society''' existed in [[Weimar_Republic|Weimar]] [[Berlin]]. However, there is no evidence for the existence of such a society.

==History==
The original, British edition of ''The Coming Race'' was published anonymously in May 1871, by Blackwood and Sons of Edinburgh and London.&lt;ref name=newsUK/&gt; (Blackwood published four more "editions" in 1871.)&lt;ref name="editions"/&gt; Anonymous American and Canadian editions were published in August, as ''The Coming Race, or The New Utopia'', by Francis B. Felt &amp; Co. in New York and by Copp, Clark &amp; Co. in Toronto.&lt;ref name=newsUS/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsCA/&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Late in 1871 Bulwer-Lytton was known to be the author.{{cn|date=December 2017}} [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Erewhon]]'' was also published anonymously, in March 1872, and Butler suspected that its initial success was due to being taken as a ''Coming Race'' sequel by Bulwer-Lytton. It was revealed that Butler was the writer in the 25 May 1872 issue of the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]''; as Butler was unknown at the time, sales dropped by 90 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Redfield | first = Marc | title = Phantom Formations: Aesthetic Ideology and the Bildungsroman | publisher = Cornell University Press | date = 1996 | page = 170 | isbn = 0-8014-3236-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==

The novel centres on a young, independent, unnamed, wealthy traveller (the narrator), who visits a friend,  a mining engineer. They explore a natural chasm in a mine which has been exposed by an exploratory shaft. The narrator reaches the bottom of the chasm safely, but the rope breaks and his friend is killed. The narrator finds his way into a subterranean world occupied by beings who seem to resemble angels. He befriends the first being he meets, who guides him around a city  that is reminiscent of ancient Egyptian architecture. The explorer meets his host's wife, two sons and daughter who learn to speak English by way of a makeshift [[dictionary]] during which the narrator unconsciously teaches them the language. His guide comes towards him, and he and his daughter, Zee, explain who they are and how they function.

The hero discovers that these beings, who call themselves Vril-ya, have great telepathic and other parapsychological abilities, such as being able to [[Telepathy|transmit information]], [[Analgesic|get rid of pain]], and [[Hypnosis|put others to sleep.]] The narrator is offended by the idea that the Vril-ya are better adapted to learn about him than he is to learn about them. Nevertheless, the guide (who turns out to be a magistrate) and his son Taee behave kindly towards him.

The narrator soon discovers that the Vril-ya are descendants of an [[antediluvian]] civilization called the Ana, who live in networks of subterranean caverns linked by tunnels. Originally surface dwellers, they had fled underground thousands of years ago to escape a massive flood and gained greater power by facing and dominating the harsh conditions of the Earth. The place where the narrator descended housed 12,000 families, one of the largest groups. Their society was a technologically supported Utopia, chief among their tools being an "all-permeating fluid" called "Vril", a latent source of energy that the spiritually elevated hosts are able to master through training of their will, to a degree that depended on their hereditary constitution. This mastery gave them access to an extraordinary force that could be controlled at will. It is this fluid that the Vril-ya employed to communicate with the narrator. The powers of the Vril included the ability to heal, change, and destroy beings and things; the destructive powers in particular were powerful, allowing a few young Vril-ya children to destroy entire cities if necessary.

Men (called An, pronounced "Arn") and women (called Gy, pronounced "Gee") have equal rights. The women are stronger and larger than the men. The women are also the pursuing party of romantic relationships. They marry for just three years, after which the men choose whether to remain married, or be single. The female may then pursue a new husband. However, they seldom make the choice to remarry.

Their religion posits the existence of a superior being but does not dwell on his nature. The Vril-ya believe in the permanence of life, which according to them is not destroyed but merely changes form.

The narrator adopts the attire of his hosts and begins also to adopt their customs. Zee falls in love with him and tells her father, who orders Taee to kill him with his staff. Eventually both Taee and Zee conspire against such a command, and Zee leads the narrator through the same chasm which he first descended. Returning to the surface, he warns that in time the Vril-ya will run out of habitable space underground and will claim the surface of the Earth, destroying mankind in the process, if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bulwer Lytton|first1=Edward|title=Vril: The Power of the Coming Race|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Vril:_The_Power_of_the_Coming_Race;_The_New_Utopia|website=wikisource.com|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vril in the novel===

The uses of Vril in the novel amongst the Vril-ya vary from destruction to healing. According to Zee, the daughter of the narrator's host, Vril can be changed into the mightiest agency over all types of matter, both animate and inanimate. It can destroy like lightning or replenish life, heal, or cure. It is used to rend ways through solid matter. Its light is said to be steadier, softer and healthier than that from any flammable material. It can also be used as a power source for animating mechanisms. Vril can be harnessed by use of the Vril staff or mental concentration.

A Vril staff is an object in the shape of a wand or a staff which is used as a channel for Vril. The narrator describes it as hollow with "stops", "keys", or "springs" in which Vril can be altered, modified, or directed to either destroy or heal. The staff is about the size of a walking stick but can be lengthened or shortened according to the user's preferences. The appearance and function of the Vril staff differs according to gender, age, etc. Some staves are more potent for destruction; others, for healing. The staves of children are said to be much simpler than those of sages; in those of wives and mothers, the destructive part is removed while the healing aspects are emphasised.

==Literary significance and reception==

The book was quite popular in the late 19th century, and for a time the word "Vril" came to be associated with "life-giving elixirs".&lt;ref name = "dav"&gt;{{Citation | first = David | last = Seed | origyear = 1870 | title = The Coming Race | first2 = Sir Edward | last2 = Bulwer‐Lytton | publisher = Wesleyan University Press | date = 2007 | pages = xvii, 159}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The best known use of "Vril" in this context is in the name of [[Bovril]] (a [[blend word]] of Bovine and Vril).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Peter | last = Hadley | title = A History of Bovril Advertising | place = London | publisher = Bovril | date = 1972 | page = 13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From 5 to 7 March 1891, there was even a "Vril-ya Bazaar" held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 48ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research has shown that Bulwer-Lytton developed his ideas about "Vril" against the background of his long preoccupation with occult natural forces, which were widely discussed at that time, especially in relation to [[animal magnetism]] or, later, [[spiritualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 13–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In his earlier novels ''[[Zanoni]]'' (1842) and ''A Strange Story'' (1862), Bulwer-Lytton had discussed electricity and other "material agents" as the possible natural causes for occult phenomena. In ''The Coming Race'', those ideas are continued in the context of a satirical critique of contemporary philosophical, scientific, and political currents. In a letter to his friend John Forster, Bulwer-Lytton explained his motives:

{{bq|1=I did not mean Vril for mesmerism, but for electricity, developed into uses as yet only dimly guessed, and including whatever there may be genuine in mesmerism, which I hold to be a mere branch current of the one great fluid pervading all nature. I am by no means, however, wedded to Vril, if you can suggest anything else to carry out this meaning namely, that the coming race, though akin to us, has nevertheless acquired by hereditary transmission, etc., certain distinctions which make it a different species, and contains powers which we could not attain to through a slow growth of time; so that this race would not amalgamate with, but destroy us. [...]

Now, as some bodies are charged with electricity like the torpedo or electric eel, and never can communicate that power to other bodies, so I suppose the existence of a race charged with that electricity and having acquired the art to concentre and direct it in a word, to be conductors of its lightnings. If you can suggest any other idea of carrying out that idea of a destroying race, I should be glad. Probably even the notion of Vril might be more cleared from mysticism or mesmerism by being simply defined to be electricity and conducted by those staves or rods, omitting all about mesmeric passes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Victor Alexander Robert | last = Lytton | title = The Life of Edward Bulwer Lytton, First Lord Lytton, vol. 1 |url=https://archive.org/details/lifeofedwardbulw00lyttuoft| place = London | publisher = Macmillan and Co. | date = 1913 | page = 466f.}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bulwer-Lytton has been regarded as an "initiate" or "adept" by esotericists, especially because of his [[Rosicrucian]] novel ''Zanoni'' (1842). However, there is no historical evidence that suggests that Bulwer-Lytton can be seen as an occultist, or that he has been the member of any kind of esoteric association. Instead, it has been shown that Bulwer-Lytton has been "esotericized" since the 1870s. In 1870, the [[Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia]] appointed Bulwer-Lytton as her "Grand Patron." Although Bulwer-Lytton complained about this by letter in 1872, the claim has never been revoked. Other claims, such as his membership in a German [[masonic]] lodge ''Zur aufgehenden Morgenröthe'', have been proven wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 55–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those claims, as well as the recurrent esoteric topics in Bulwer-Lytton's works, convinced some commentators that the fictionalised Vril was based on a real magical force. [[Helena Blavatsky]], the founder of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], endorsed this view in her book ''Isis Unveiled'' (1877) and again in ''The Secret Doctrine'' (1888). In Blavatsky, the Vril power and its attainment by a superhuman elite are worked into a mystical doctrine of race. However, the character of the subterranean people was transformed. Instead of potential conquerors, they were benevolent (if mysterious) spiritual guides. Blavatsky's recurrent homage to Bulwer-Lytton and the Vril force has exerted a lasting influence on other esoteric authors.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 69ff., 77ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[William Scott-Elliot]] describes life in [[Atlantis]] in {{Citation | title = The Story of Atlantis &amp; The Lost Lemuria | edition = first | date = 1896}}, the aircraft of the Atlanteans are propelled by Vril-force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = L Sprague | last = de Camp | title = [[Lost Continents]] | date = 1954 | edition = first | page = 67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His books are still published by the [[Theosophical Society]]. Scott-Elliot's description of Atlantean aircraft has been identified as an early inspiration for authors who have related the Vril force to [[UFO]]s after World War II.

[[George Bernard Shaw]] read the book and was attracted to the idea of Vril, according to [[Michael Holroyd]]'s biography of him.

French writer [[Jules Lermina]] included a Vril-powered flying machine in his {{Citation | language = French | date = 1910 | type = novel | title = L'Effrayante Aventure | trans-title = Panic in Paris}}.

==Stage adaptation==

A stage adaptation of the book was written by journalist [[David Christie Murray]] and magician [[Nevil Maskelyne (magician)|Nevil Maskelyne]]. The production premiered at [[St. George's Hall, London|Saint George's Hall]] in London on 2 January 1905. Both Nevil Maskelyne and his father [[John Nevil Maskelyne]] collaborated on the special effects for the play. The play did not meet with success and closed after a run of eight weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jim | last = Steinmeyer | author-link = Jim Steinmeyer | title = Hiding the Elephant: How Magicians Invented the Impossible and Learned to Disappear | publisher = Carrol &amp; Graf | type = trade paperback | date = 2004 | pages = 184–85}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vril Society==

===Willy Ley===
[[Image:Heinz Haber Wernher von Braun Willy Ley (1954).jpg|thumb|190px|[[Willy Ley]] (right) in a discussion with [[Heinz Haber]] and [[Wernher von Braun|Wernher v. Braun]], 1954]]
[[Willy Ley]] was a German rocket engineer who had emigrated to the United States in 1937.&lt;!-- or 1933 or 1935; 1937 says the German wiki-article on him--&gt; In 1947, he published an article titled "Pseudoscience in Naziland" in the magazine ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Willy | last = Ley |date=May 1947 | title = Pseudoscience in Naziland | journal = Astounding Science Fiction | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 90–98 | url = http://www.alpenfestung.com/ley_pseudoscience.htm | publisher = Alpenfestung}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that the high popularity of irrational convictions in Germany at that time explained how National Socialism could have fallen on such fertile ground. Among various pseudoscientific groups he mentions one that looked for the Vril: 
"The next group was literally founded upon a novel. That group which I think called itself 'Wahrheitsgesellschaft'&amp;nbsp;— Society for Truth&amp;nbsp;—and which was more or less localised in Berlin, devoted its spare time looking for Vril."

===Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels===
The existence of a Vril Society was alleged in 1960 by [[Jacques Bergier]] and [[Louis Pauwels]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke (2002), 113.&lt;/ref&gt; In their book ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'', they claimed that the Vril-Society was a secret community of occultists in pre-Nazi [[Berlin]] that was a sort of inner circle of the [[Thule Society]]. They also thought that it was in close contact with the English group known as the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]. The Vril information takes up about a tenth of the volume, the remainder of which details other esoteric speculations, but the authors fail to clearly explain whether this section is fact or fiction. Historians have shown that there has been no actual historical foundation for the claims of Pauwels and Bergier, and that the article of Willy Ley has only been a vague inspiration for their own ideas. Nevertheless, Pauwels and Bergier have influenced a whole new literary genre dealing with the alleged occult influences on National Socialism which have often been related to the fictional Vril Society.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 126–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Monsieur Gurdjieff'', Louis Pauwels&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Amazon | title = Monsieur Gurdjieff | first = Louis | last = Pauwels | language = French | place = [[France|FR]]| id =  {{ASIN|2226081968|country=fr}} }}.&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that a Vril Society had been founded by General [[Karl Haushofer]], a student of [[Russia]]n magician and metaphysician [[George Gurdjieff|Georges Gurdjieff]].

===Publications on the Vril Society in German===
The book of [[Jacques Bergier]] and [[Louis Pauwels]] was published in [[German language|German]] with the title: ''Aufbruch ins dritte Jahrtausend: von der Zukunft der phantastischen Vernunft'' (literally ''Departure into the Third Millennium: The Future of the Fantastic Reason'') in 1969.

In his book [[Black Sun (Goodrick-Clarke book)|''Black Sun'']], [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke|Professor Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] refers to the research of the German author Peter Bahn. Bahn writes in his 1996 essay, "Das Geheimnis der Vril-Energie" ("The Secret of Vril Energy"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first= Peter |last= Bahn |title= Das Geheimnis der Vril-Energie: Berichte und Erfahrungen zu einer mächtigen Naturkraft |editor1-first= Adolf | editor1-last = Schneider |editor2-first= Inge |editor2-last= Schneider |work= Vorträge des Kongresses 1995 im Gwatt-Zentrum am Thunersee &lt;!-- Duplicate parameter --&gt;|place= Bern |publisher= Jupiter-Verlag A.+l.

Die Kosmische Urkraft'' (Vril, the cosmic elementary power) written by a member of this Berlin-based group, under the pseudonym "Johannes Täufer" (German: "John [the] Baptist"). Published by the influential astrological publisher, Otto Wilhelm Barth (whom Bahn believes was "Täufer"), the 60-page pamphlet says little of the group other than that it was founded in 1925 to study the uses of Vril energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Johannes | last = Täufer | contribution = "Vril" Die Kosmische Urkraft Wiedergeburt von Atlantis | language = German | title = Herausgegeben im Auftrage der Reichsarbeitgemeinschaft "Das kommende Deutschland" Zentralbüro | place = Berlin W 57, Pallasstr. 7 | publisher = Astrologischer Verlag Wilhelm Becker: Berlin Steglitz, Schloßstraße 69 | date = 1930}}. [[:de:Datei:Vril Urkraft Einband.jpg|See image in German Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The German historian Julian Strube has argued that the historical existence of the "Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft" can be regarded as irrelevant to the post-war invention of the Vril Society, as Pauwels and Bergier have developed their ideas without any knowledge of that actual association.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 126–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Strube has also shown that the Vril force has been irrelevant to the other members of the "Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft," who were supporters of the theories of the Austrian inventor Karl Schappeller (1875–1947).&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 98–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Esoteric neo-Nazism===
After World War II, a group referred to by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke as the [[Landig Group|Vienna Circle]] elaborated an esoteric neo-Nazism that contributed to the circulation of the Vril topos in a new context.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; In their writings, Vril is associated with [[Nazi UFOs]] and the [[Black Sun (occult symbol)|Black Sun]] concept. Julian Strube wrote that a younger generation related to the [[Neo-völkisch movements#Tempelhofgesellschaft|Tempelhofgesellschaft]], has continued the work of the Vienna Circle and exerts a continuous influence on the most common notions of Vril. Those notions are not only popular in neo-Nazi circles but also in movies or computer games, such as ''[[Iron Sky]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein (2009 video game)|Wolfenstein]]'', and ''[[Call of Duty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 48ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
