      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3139">[[File:Correggio_-_Allegory_of_Virtues_-_WGA05338.jpg|thumb|350px]]
The '''''Allegory of Virtue''''' is an oil on canvas painting by [[Correggio]] dating to around 1531 and measuring 149 by 88 cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Giuseppe Adani, ''Correggio pittore universale'', Silvana Editoriale, Correggio 2007. {{ISBN|9788836609772}}&lt;/ref&gt; It and ''[[Allegory of Vice (Correggio)|Allegory of Vice]]'' were painted as a pair for the [[studiolo]] of [[Isabella d'Este]], with ''Vice'' probably the second of the two to be completed. This hypothesis is since only one (possibly non-autograph) sketch survives for ''Vice'', unlike ''Virtue'', for which two preparatory studies survive (in the [[Louvre]]), along with a near-complete oil sketch (attributed to Correggio in the 1603 inventory of the [[Aldobrandini]] collection and now at the [[Galleria Doria Pamphili]]) - this suggests Correggio had become more proficient after the difficult gestation of ''Virtue''.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Mauro Lucco (ed), ''Mantegna a Mantova 1460-1506'', exhibition catalogue, Skira Milano, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

File:Allegoria della virtù, disegno preparatorio 2, louvre.jpg|Sketch
&lt;/gallery&gt;

As usually interpreted, the central woman is [[Minerva]], holding a read lance and a plumed helmet - the work may even be a continuation of [[Mantegna]]'s ''[[Triumph of the Virtues (Mantegna)|Triumph of the Virtues]]'', painted for the same studiolo and also featuring a Minerva with a red lance. (Others have interpreted the figure as Isabella herself, dressed as Wisdom.) Glory hovers above her holding a crown, whilst a seated female figure to the right is surrounded by symbols of the four [[cardinal virtues]] (a snake in her hair for Prudence, a sword for Justice, reins for temperance and [[Hercules]]'s lion skin for Fortitude). Some interpret the seated black female figure on the right as Astrology, Science or Intellectual Virtue - she points outside the painting's space and thus (like the putto in ''Vice'') draws the viewer's attention from one painting to the other. 

After the studiolo's contents was dispersed, ''Virtue'' and the Mantegna were given to [[cardinal Richelieu]] around 1627 and moved to Paris. There they were acquired by [[Eberhard Jabach]] in 1671, before being sold by him to [[Louis XIV]] - ''Virtue'' still hangs in the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartelfr.louvre.fr/cartelfr/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=14291&amp;langue=fr|title=Site officiel du musée du Louvre|website=Cartelfr.louvre.fr|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.correggioarthome.it/Sezione.jsp?idSezione=171&amp;idSezioneRif=54|title=Giulio Sanuto, Apollo e Marsia, 1562 - Correggio ART HOME|first=Netribe|last=srl|website=Correggioarthome.it|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''American Abstract Artists''' ('''AAA''') was formed in 1936 in [[New York City]], to promote and foster public understanding of [[abstract art]]. American Abstract Artists exhibitions, publications, and lectures helped to establish the organization as a major forum for the exchange and discussion of ideas, and for presenting abstract art to a broader public. The American Abstract Artists group contributed to the development and acceptance of abstract art in the [[United States]] and has a historic role in its [[avant-garde]].&lt;ref&gt;''Pioneers of Abstract Art: American Abstract Artists, 1936–1996'', exhibition catalog. Sidney Mishkin Gallery, Baruch College, 1996. Text by Sandra Kraskin. p 5.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the few artists’ organizations to survive from the [[Great Depression]] and continue into the 21st century.

==History==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Painting No. 48 - Marsden Hartley - overall.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Marsden Hartley]] (American, 1877–1943). ''Painting No. 48'', 1913. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
During the 1930s, abstract art was viewed with critical opposition and there was little support from [[art galleries]] and [[museums]]. The American Abstract Artists group was established in 1936 as a forum for discussion and debate of abstract art and to provide exhibition opportunities when few other possibilities existed.&lt;ref&gt;''Pioneers of Abstract Art: American Abstract Artists, 1936–1996'', Sandra Kraskin. p 5, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 AAA issued a “General Prospectus.” It outlined the purpose of the organization and the importance of exhibitions in promoting the growth and acceptance of abstract art in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Susan C. “The American Abstract Artists: A Documentary History 1936–1941”, ''Archives of American Art Journal'', Vol. 14, No. 1 (1974), p 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

AAA held its first exhibition in 1937 at the Squibb Gallery in New York City. This was the most extensive and widely attended exhibition of American [[abstract painting]] and [[sculpture]] outside of a museum during the 1930s.For the 1937 exhibition AAA produced its first print portfolio of original zinc plate [[lithographs]], instead of documenting the exhibit with a catalog.&lt;ref name="Larsen, Susan C. p 3"&gt;Larsen, Susan C. “The American Abstract Artists: A Documentary History 1936–1941”, p 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Future exhibitions and publications would establish AAA as a major forum for the discussion and presentation of new abstract and [[non-objective art]].&lt;ref&gt;''American Abstract Artists, The Language of Abstraction'', exhibition catalog. Betty Parsons Gallery, Marilyn Pearl Gallery, 1979. Text by Susan Larson. p 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most influential critics dismissed American abstract art as too [[European culture|European]] and therefore “un-American”. There was extensive hostile criticism of AAA exhibits in New York City newspapers and art magazines of the time.&lt;ref name="Abstract Art p 5"&gt;''Pioneers of Abstract Art: American Abstract Artists, 1936–1996'', Sandra Kraskin. p 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  American abstract art was struggling to win acceptance and AAA personified this. The 1938 Yearbook addressed criticisms levied against abstract art by the press and public. It also featured essays related to principles behind and the practice of making abstract art. In 1940, AAA printed a [[broadside (printing)|broadside]] titled “How Modern is the [[Museum of Modern Art]]?” which was handed out at a protest in front of MOMA.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Susan C. “The American Abstract Artists: A Documentary History 1936–1941”, p 4, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the Museum of Modern Art had a policy of featuring European abstraction while endorsing American [[Regionalism (art)|regionalism]] and [[American scene painting|scene painting]]. This policy helped entrench the notion that abstraction was foreign to the American experience.&lt;ref&gt;''Pioneers of Abstract Art: American Abstract Artists, 1936–1996'', Sandra Kraskin. p 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year AAA produced a 12-page pamphlet: “The Art Critics – ! How Do They Serve the Public? What Do They Say? How Much Do They Know? Let’s Look at the Record.” The AAA publication quoted critics, highlighting misstatements and contradictions in the press.  The pamphlet excoriated notable ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' critic [[Royal Cortissoz]] for his rigid loyalty to traditionalism, his patent distaste for abstract and modern art, and generally for what the pamphlet regarded as his "resistance to knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.americanabstractartists.org/history/artcritics/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620045921/http://www.americanabstractartists.org/history/artcritics/ |archive-date=June 20, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also characterized the aesthetic vacillations of Thomas Craven, critic of the ''[[New York American]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://arthistorians.info/cravent&lt;/ref&gt; as opportunistic.  In 1936, Craven labeled Picasso's work "Bohemian infantilism".  The ensuing years would see a growing public appreciation for abstract art until, in 1939, the critic made an about-face and lauded Picasso for his "unrivaled inventiveness".  The pamphlet applauded [[Henry McBride (art critic)|Henry McBride]] of the ''New York Sun'' and [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]] of the ''New Yorker'' for their critical efforts regarding abstract art.  "The Art Critics" showed the lack of knowledge the critics from New York City newspapers and art publications had about developments in 20th-century art.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Susan C. “The American Abstract Artists: A Documentary History 1936–1941”, p 6, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

AAA combated prevailing hostile attitudes toward abstraction and prepared the way for its acceptance after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Abstract Art p 5" /&gt; AAA was a precursor to [[abstract expressionism]] by helping abstract art discover its identity in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Susan C. “The American Abstract Artists: A Documentary History 1936–1941”, p 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1940s the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] gained momentum and throughout the mid-1940s and 1950s Abstract Expressionism dominated the American avant-garde. American Abstract Artists continued its mandate as an advocate for abstract art.&lt;ref name="Abstract Art p 25"&gt;''Pioneers of Abstract Art: American Abstract Artists, 1936–1996'', Sandra Kraskin. p 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

American Abstract Artists is active today. To date the organization has produced over 75 exhibitions of its membership in museums and galleries across the United States.  AAA has published 5 Journals, in addition to brochures, books, catalogs, and has hosted critical panels and symposia.  AAA distributes its published materials internationally to cultural organizations.&lt;ref&gt;''Continuum: In Celebration of the 70th Anniversary of AAA'', exhibition press release. St. Peter's College Art Gallery, O'Toole Library, Jersey City, NJ (March 21 – April 25, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; American Abstract Artist produces print portfolios by its membership. AAA print portfolios are in the collections of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], Museum of Modern Art, [[Tate]] in [[London]],&lt;ref name="Abstract Art p 25" /&gt; and the [[Archives of American Art]].&lt;ref name="Larsen, Susan C. p 3" /&gt;

In 2014  [[Harry Holtzman]] and [[George L.K. Morris]],  founding members of the American Abstract Artists were paired  in an intimate 2-man exhibit, curated by Kinney Frelinghuysen  and Madalena Holtzman, and designed to evoke an informal conversation between the two artists. [[George L.K. Morris Harry Holtzman Pioneers of American Modernism: Points of Contact]]. Essays by T. Kinney Frelinghuysen, Madalena Holtzman, Wietse Coppes. Catalogue published on the occasion of the exhibition from June 26 to October 12, 2014 at the [[Frelinghuysen Morris House and Studio]] Lenox MA. This exhibition marked also the beginning of a collaboration between the Estates of [[George L.K. Morris]] and Harry Holtzman, with support of the [[RKD - Netherlands Institute for Art History]]. The collaboration aims at sharing, editing and exhibiting new historical materials related and connected to the world of abstract art of the seminal period of the 1930s and 1940s in Europe and in the USA. For this reason in this first show will be present also the works of other European protagonists of the time like [[Jean Hélion]], [[Cesar Domela]], and [[Ben Nicholson]].
A project, that duly enlarged and in the details curated will be evolving into a wider exhibition initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mondriaan.nl/news/view/tentoonstelling_morris_holtzman |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140726185501/http://www.mondriaan.nl/news/view/tentoonstelling_morris_holtzman |archive-date=July 26, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.frelinghuysen.org/news/38-season-opens-june-26-with-pioneers-of-american-modernism.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809064744/http://www.frelinghuysen.org/news/38-season-opens-june-26-with-pioneers-of-american-modernism.html |archive-date=August 9, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''animator''' is an [[artist]] who creates multiple images, known as frames, which give an illusion of movement called [[animation]] when displayed in rapid sequence.  Animators can work in a variety of fields including [[film]], television, and [[video game]]s.  Animation is closely related to [[filmmaking]] and like filmmaking is extremely labor-intensive, which means that most significant works require the collaboration of several animators. The methods of creating the images or frames for an animation piece depend on the animators' artistic styles and their field.

Other artists who contribute to [[animated cartoon]]s, but who are not animators, include [[Page layout|layout]] artists (who design the backgrounds, lighting, and camera angles), [[storyboard]] artists (who draw panels of the action from the script), and [[background artist]]s (who paint the "scenery").  Animated films share some [[film crew]] positions with regular [[live action]] films, such as director, producer, sound engineer, and editor, but differ radically in that for most of the history of animation, they did not need most of the crew positions seen on a physical set.

In hand-drawn Japanese animation productions, such as in [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s films, the key animator handles both layout and key animation. Some animators in Japan such as [[Mitsuo Iso]] take full responsibility for their scenes, making them become more than just the key animator.

==Specialized fields==
Animators often specialize.  One important distinction is between [[character animator]]s (artists who specialize in character movement, [[dialogue]], [[acting]], etc.) and [[special effects animator]]s (who animate anything that is ''not'' a character; most commonly [[vehicle]]s, [[machinery]], and natural phenomena such as rain, snow, and water).

==Inbetweeners and cleanup artists==
In large-scale productions by major studios, each animator usually has one or more assistants, "[[Tweening|inbetweeners]]" and "[[clean-up]] artists", who make drawings between the "key poses" drawn by the animator, and also re-draw any sketches that are too roughly made to be used as such. Usually, a young artist seeking to break into animation is hired for the first time in one of these categories, and can later advance to the rank of full animator (usually after working on several productions).

==Methods==
Historically, the creation of animation was a long and arduous process. Each frame of a given scene was hand-drawn, then transposed onto celluloid, where it would be traced and painted.  These finished "cels" were then placed together in sequence over painted backgrounds and filmed, one frame at a time.&lt;ref&gt;"How A Cartoon is Made" {{cite web|url=http://www.sci.fi/~animato/cartoon/cartoon.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925111819/http://www.sci.fi/~animato/cartoon/cartoon.html |archivedate=2006-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animation methods have become far more varied in recent years.  Today's cartoons could be created using any number of methods, mostly using computers to make the animation process cheaper and faster. These more efficient animation procedures have made the animator's job less tedious and more creative.

Audiences generally find animation to be much more interesting with sound.  [[Voice actor]]s and [[musician]]s, among other talent, may contribute vocal or music tracks.  Some early animated films asked the vocal and music talent to synchronize their recordings to already-extant animation (and this is still the case when films are [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] for international audiences).  For the majority of animated films today, the soundtrack is recorded first in the language of the film's primary target market and the animators are required to synchronize their work to the soundtrack.

==Evolution of Animator's roles==

Animation is the art of creating moving images. This line of work is all about creating a series of individual ‘frames’, which make images come to life when they are flicked through in rapid succession.Previously, animation was done manually, with animators drawing multiple frames to depict a single action, i.e. the kind of animation that you witnessed during a typical scene from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon, Tom and Jerry. Today, computer-generated imagery (CGI) has mostly replaced manual animation, but a significant amount of artistic talent is still required.

Animators are employed in various segments of the entertainment industry,including film, television and video games.

As a result of the ongoing transition from [[traditional animation|traditional]] 2D to 3D [[computer animation]], the animator's traditional task of redrawing and repainting the same character 24 times a second (for each second of finished animation) has now been superseded by the modern task of developing dozens (or hundreds) of movements of different parts of a character in a virtual scene.

Because of the transition to computer animation, many additional support positions have become essential, with the result that the animator has become but one component of a very long and highly specialized production pipeline.  Nowadays, visual development artists will design a character as a 2D drawing or painting, then hand it off to [[3D modeling|modelers]] who build the character as a collection of digital polygons.  [[Texture artist]]s "paint" the character with colorful or complex textures, and [[technical director]]s set up [[Skeletal animation|rigging]] so that the character can be easily moved and posed.  For each scene, layout artists set up virtual cameras and rough [[Blocking (stage)|blocking]].  Finally, when a character's bugs have been worked out and its scenes have been blocked, it is handed off to an animator (that is, a person with that actual job title) who can start developing the exact movements of the character's virtual limbs, muscles, and facial expressions in each specific scene.

At that point, the role of the modern computer animator overlaps in some respects with that of his or her predecessors in traditional animation: namely, trying to create scenes already storyboarded in rough form by a team of story artists, and synchronizing lip or mouth movements to dialogue already prepared by a screenwriter and recorded by vocal talent.  Despite those constraints, the animator is still capable of exercising significant artistic skill and discretion in developing the character's movements to accomplish the objective of each scene.  There is an obvious analogy here between the art of animation and the art of acting, in that actors also must do the best they can with the lines they are given; it is often encapsulated by the common industry saying that animators are "actors with pencils".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaut|first1=Berys|title=A Philosophy of Cinematic Art|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521822442|pages=138–139}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 June 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Chris Buck]] has remarked that animators have become "actors with [[Mouse (computing)|mice]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Virtue|first1=Robert|title=Acclaimed Disney director shares his creative vision for Newcastle|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2015/04/29/4226204.htm|accessdate=2 May 2015|work=1233 ABC Newcastle|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studios bring in acting coaches on feature films to help animators work through such issues.  Once each scene is complete and has been perfected through the "[[sweat box]]" feedback process, the resulting data can be dispatched to a [[render farm]], where computers handle the tedious task of actually [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] all the frames.  Each finished film clip is then checked for quality and rushed to a film editor, who assembles the clips together to create the film.

While early computer animation was heavily criticized for rendering human characters that looked plastic or even worse, eerie (see [[uncanny valley]]), contemporary software can now render strikingly realistic clothing, hair, and skin.  The solid shading of traditional animation has been replaced by very sophisticated virtual lighting in computer animation, and computer animation can take advantage of many camera techniques used in live-action filmmaking (i.e., simulating real-world "camera shake" through [[motion capture]] of a cameraman's movements).  As a result, some studios now hire nearly as many lighting artists as animators for animated films, while costume designers, hairstylists, and cinematographers have occasionally been called upon to consult on newer projects.

[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - The basilisk and the weasel.jpg|thumb|right|The basilisk and the weasel, in a print attributed to [[Wenceslas Hollar]].  The cockatrice (pictured) became seen as synonymous with the basilisk when the "basiliscus" in Bartholomeus Anglicus' De proprietatibus rerum (ca 1260) was translated by John Trevisa as "cockatrice" (1397).[4] A basilisk, however, is usually depicted without wings.]]

In [[Europe]]an [[bestiary|bestiaries]] and [[legend]]s, a '''basilisk''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|s|ɪ|l|ɪ|s|k}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|z|ɪ|l|ɪ|s|k}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/basilisk|title=the definition of basilisk|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] βασιλίσκος ''basilískos'', "little king"; Latin ''regulus'') is a legendary [[reptile]] reputed to be a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] king who can cause [[death]] with a single glance. According to the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]], the basilisk of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] is a small snake, "being not more than twelve fingers in length",&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, viii.33.&lt;/ref&gt; that is so [[venom]]ous, it leaves a wide trail of deadly venom in its wake, and its gaze is likewise lethal. Its weakness is the odor of the [[weasel]], which, according to Pliny, was thrown into the basilisk's hole, recognizable because some of the surrounding shrubs and grass had been scorched by its presence. It is possible that the legend of the basilisk and its association with the weasel in [[Europe]] was inspired by accounts of certain species of Asiatic snakes (such as the [[king cobra]]) and their natural predator, the [[mongoose]].

==Accounts==
The basilisk is called "king" because it is reputed to have on its head a [[mitre]], or crown-shaped [[sagittal crest|crest]]. Stories of the basilisk show that it is not completely distinguished from the [[cockatrice]]. The basilisk is alleged to be hatched by a [[cockerel]] from the egg of a [[snake|serpent]] or [[True toad|toad]] (the reverse of the [[cockatrice]], which was hatched from a cockerel's "egg" incubated by a serpent or toad).&lt;!--whose neat polarity is this?--&gt; In [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]], the description of the creature began taking on features from cockerels.

One of the earliest accounts of the basilisk comes from [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', written in roughly 79 AD. He describes the [[catoblepas]], a monstrous cow-like creature of which "all who behold its eyes, fall dead upon the spot",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Natural History|authors=Pliny the Elder, eds. [[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]], [[Henry Thomas Riley]] (translators)|year=1855|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137;query=chapter%3D%23357;layout=;loc=8.33  |accessdate=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then goes on to say,

{{quote|There is the same power also in the serpent called the basilisk. It is produced in the province of [[Cyrenaica|Cyrene]], being not more than twelve fingers in length. It has a white spot on the head, strongly resembling a sort of a diadem. When it hisses, all the other serpents fly from it: and it does not advance its body, like the others, by a succession of folds, but moves along upright and erect upon the middle. It destroys all shrubs, not only by its contact, but those even that it has breathed upon; it burns up all the grass, too, and breaks the stones, so tremendous is its noxious influence. It was formerly a general belief that if a man on horseback killed one of these animals with a spear, the poison would run up the weapon and kill, not only the rider, but the horse, as well. To this dreadful monster the effluvium of the weasel is fatal, a thing that has been tried with success, for kings have often desired to see its body when killed; so true is it that it has pleased Nature that there should be nothing without its antidote. The animal is thrown into the hole of the basilisk, which is easily known from the soil around it being infected. The weasel destroys the basilisk by its odour, but dies itself in this struggle of nature against its own self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Natural History|editor=Pliny the Elder |translator=John Bostock |translator2=H.T.

[[File:Munchen Basilisk.JPG|thumb|left|A [[putto]] kills a basilisk, symbolic of [[Thirty Years' War#Swedish intervention (1630–1635)|Swedish occupiers]] and Protestant heresy, on the ''[[Marienplatz|Mariensäule]]'', Munich, erected in 1638.]]

[[Isidore of Seville]] defined the basilisk as the king of [[snake]]s, due to its killing glare and its poisonous breath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Isidore of Seville |title=The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ep502syZv8C&amp;pg=PA255 |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-139-45616-6 |page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bede|Venerable Bede]] was the first to attest to the legend of the birth of a basilisk from an egg by an old cockerel, and then other authors added the condition of [[Sirius]] being ascendant. [[Alexander Neckam]] (died 1217) was the first to say that not the glare but the "air corruption" was the killing tool of the basilisk, a theory developed one century later by [[Pietro d'Abano]].

[[Theophilus Presbyter]] gave a long recipe in his book{{Which one|date=November 2017}} for creating a basilisk to convert [[copper]] into "Spanish gold" (''De auro hyspanico'').  The compound was formed by combining powdered basilisk blood, powdered human blood, red copper, and a special kind of vinegar.

[[Albertus Magnus]] in the ''De animalibus'' wrote about the killing gaze of the basilisk, but he denied other legends, such as the rooster hatching the egg. He gave as source of those legends [[Hermes Trismegistus]], who is credited also as the creator of the story about the basilisk's ashes being able to convert [[silver]] into [[gold]]: the attribution is absolutely incorrect, but it shows how the legends of the basilisk were already linked to [[alchemy]] in the 13th century.

[[Geoffrey Chaucer]] featured a ''basilicok'' (as he called it; possibly in relation to the [[Rooster|cock]]) in his ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]''. According to some legends, basilisks can be killed by hearing the crow of a rooster or gazing at itself through a mirror.&lt;ref name="Knight1854"&gt;{{cite book

Stories gradually added to the basilisk's deadly capabilities, such as describing it as a larger beast, capable of breathing fire and killing with the sound of its voice. Some writers even claimed it could kill not only by touch, but also by touching something that is touching the victim, like a sword held in the hand. Also, some stories claim its breath is highly toxic and will cause death, usually immediately. The basilisk is also the guardian creature and traditional symbol of the Swiss city [[Basel]].

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] included a basilisk in his [[Bestiary]], saying it is so utterly cruel that when it cannot kill animals by its baleful gaze, it turns upon herbs and plants, and fixing its gaze on them withers them up. In his notebooks, he describes the basilisk, in an account clearly dependent directly or indirectly on Pliny's:

{{quote|This is found in the province of [[Cyrenaica]] and is not more than 12 fingers long. It has on its head a white spot after the fashion of a [[diadem (personal wear)|diadem]]. It scares all serpents with its whistling. It resembles a snake, but does not move by wriggling but from the centre forwards to the right. It is said that one of these, being killed with a spear by one who was on horse-back, and its venom flowing on the spear, not only the man but the horse also died. It spoils the wheat and not only that which it touches, but where it breathes the grass dries and the stones are split.}}

Then Leonardo noted the following on the [[weasel]]: "This beast finding the lair of the basilisk kills it with the smell of its urine, and this smell, indeed, often kills the weasel itself."

[[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] wrote that the basilisk "is alwayes, and cannot but be a male, as the more proper receptacle of venome and destructive qualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esotericarchives.com/agrippa/preem.htm|title=Agrippa: Declamatio de nobilitate &amp; precellentia Fœminei sexus. (1529)|first=Joseph H.|last=Peterson|website=Esotericarchives.com|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the tradition of the [[Cantabrian mythology]], the ancient ''Basiliscu'' (as they called it) has disappeared in most of the Earth but still lives in [[Cantabria]], although it is rare to see it. This animal is born from an egg laid by an old cock just before his death a clear night and full moon exactly at midnight. Within a few days, the egg shell, which is not hard, but rather soft and leathery, is opened by the strange creature that already has all the features of an adult: legs, beak, cockscomb, and reptilian body. Apparently, this strange creature has an intense and penetrating fire in its eyes that at the animal that or person who gazes directly upon it would die. The weasel is the only animal that can face and even attack it. It can only be killed with the crowing of a rooster, so, until very recent times, travelers were carrying a rooster when they ventured into areas where it was said that the basilisks lived.&lt;ref name=llano&gt;{{cite book

Some have speculated that reports of [[cobra]]s may have given birth to the stories of the basilisk. Cobras can maintain an upright posture, and, as with many snakes in overlapping territories, are often killed by [[mongoose]]s. The [[king cobra]] or hamadryad has a crown-like symbol on its head. Several species of [[spitting cobras]] can incapacitate from a distance by spitting venom, most often into the prey's eyes, and may well have been confused by similar appearance with the hamadryad. The Egyptian cobra lives in the desert and was used as a symbol of royalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Magic Zoo: The Natural History of Fabulous Animals|author=Peter Costello|publisher=Sphere Ltd.|year=1979|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical literary references ==
The basilisk appears in the English Revised Version of the [[Bible]] in [[Isaiah]] 14:29 in the prophet's exhortation to the Philistines reading, "Rejoice not, O Philistia, all of thee, because the rod that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a basilisk, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent."
The King James version of the Bible states, "out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit ''shall be'' a fiery flying serpent".

In [[Psalm 91]]:13:&lt;ref&gt;Psalm 91 in the Hebrew/Protestant numbering, 90 in the Greek/Catholic liturgical sequence—see [[Psalms#Numbering]]&lt;/ref&gt; "super [[asp (reptile)|asp]]idem et ''basiliscum'' calcabis conculcabis [[lion|leonem]] et [[dragon|draconem]]" in the Latin [[Vulgate]], literally "You will tread on the lion and the dragon,/the asp and the basilisk you will trample under foot", translated in the [[King James Version]] as: Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet",&lt;ref&gt;Other modern versions, such as the [[New International Version]] have a "cobra" for the basilisk, which may be closest to the [[Hebrew]] ''pethen''.[http://biblelexicon.org/psalms/91-13.htm Biblelexicon]&lt;/ref&gt;  the basilisk appears in the [[Septuagint]] and the Latin Vulgate, though not most English translations, which gave rise to its inclusion in the subject in Early [[Medieval art]] of ''[[Christ treading on the beasts]]''.

The basilisk appears in [[On the Jews and Their Lies]] by [[theologian]] [[Martin Luther]]: 
{{quote|Wherever you see or hear a Jew teaching, do not think otherwise than that you are hearing a poisonous Basiliskus who with his face poisons and kills people.&lt;ref name="Luther"&gt;{{cite book |last=Luther |first=Martin |date=1543 |title=On The Jews and Their Lies |url=https://archive.org/details/TheJewsAndTheirLies1543En1948 |location=Los Angeles, CA |publisher=Christian Nationalist Crusade |page=22 |author-link=Martin Luther }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare's]]'' [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', the recently widowed Anne Neville, on hearing seductive compliments on her eyes from her husband's murderer (Richard, Duke of Gloucester), retorts that she wishes they were those of a basilisk, that she might kill him.&lt;ref name="David Colbert p 36"&gt;David Colbert, ''The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter'', p 36, {{ISBN|0-9708442-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Act II, Scene 4 of Shakespeare's [[Cymbeline]], a character says about a ring, "It is a basilisk unto mine eye, Kills me to hack on't."

Similarly, [[Samuel Richardson]] wrote in his novel ''[[Clarissa|Clarissa; or the History of a Young Lady]]'': “If my eyes would carry with them the execution which the eyes of the basilisk are said to do, I would make it my first business to see this creature.”&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Richardson, ''The Novels of Samuel Richardson'', Volume I, London, 1824, p 36&lt;/ref&gt;
Another reference to the basilisk is found in [[John Gay]]'s ''"The Beggar's Opera"'' (''Act II, Air XXV''):

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Man may escape from Rope and Gun;
Nay, some have out liv'd the Doctor's Pill;
Who takes a Woman must be undone, 
That Basilisk is sure to kill.&lt;ref&gt;John Gay, ''The Beggar's Opera '', {{cite web |url=http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Beggar-s-Opera.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212183529/http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Beggar-s-Opera.html |archivedate=12 December 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

[[Jonathan Swift]] alluded to the basilisk in a poem:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;See how she rears her head,
And rolls about her dreadful eyes,
To drive all virtue out, or look it dead!
'Twas sure this basilisk sent Temple thence …&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Swift, ''The Select Works of Jonathan Swift'', Vol. IV, London, 1823, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

[[Robert Browning]] included the basilisk as a figure in "A Light Woman." 
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;For see, my friend goes shaking and white;
He eyes me as the basilisk:
I have turned, it appears, his day to night,
Eclipsing his sun's disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/rbrowning/bl-rbrown-light.htm|title=Classic Literature|website=Classiclit.about.com|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

[[Alexander Pope]] also wrote, “The smiling infant in his hand shall take/ The crested basilisk and speckled snake” (Messiah, lines 81–82).
In the chapter XVI of ''The Zadig'', [[Voltaire]] mentions a basilisk, “an Animal, that will not suffer itself to be touch'd by a Man”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/18972/18972-8.txt|format=TXT|title=Zadig; Or, The Book of Fate by Voltaire|website=Gutenberg.org|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] in his "Ode to Naples" alludes to the basilisk:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Be thou like the imperial basilisk,
 Killing thy foe with unapparent wounds!
 Gaze on oppression, till at that dread risk,
 Aghast she pass from the earth’s disk.
 Fear not, but gaze,- for freemen mightier grow,
 And slaves more feeble, gazing on their foe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.online-literature.com/shelley_percy/complete-works-of-shelley/120/|title=The Complete Poetical Works of Percy Bysshe by Percy Bysshe Shelley: Ode to Naples|website=Online-literature.com|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Shelley also referred to the basilisk in his poem "[[Queen Mab (poem)|Queen Mab]]:"

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Those deserts of immeasurable sand,
Whose age-collected fervors scarce allowed
Where the shrill chirp of the green lizard's love
Broke on the sultry silentness alone,
Now teem with countless rills and shady woods,
Cornfields and pastures and white cottages;
And where the startled wilderness beheld
A savage conqueror stained in kindred blood,
A tigress sating with the flesh of lambs
The unnatural famine of her toothless cubs,
Whilst shouts and howlings through the desert rang,—
 Sloping and smooth the daisy-spangled lawn,
Offering sweet incense to the sunrise, smiles
To see a babe before his mother's door,
Sharing his morning's meal
with the green and golden basilisk
That comes to lick his feet.&lt;/poem&gt;|Part VIII}}

'''Carolingian minuscule''' or '''Caroline minuscule''' is a [[hand (handwriting)|script]] which developed as a calligraphic standard in [[Europe]] so that the [[Latin alphabet]] of [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate Bible]] could be easily recognized by the [[literate]] class from one region to another. It was developed for the first time, in about 780, by a Benedictine monk of [[Corbie Abbey]] (about 150&amp;nbsp;km north of Paris), namely, [[Alcuin of York]].&lt;ref name=Marcia&gt;Colish, Marcia L. Medieval foundations of the western intellectual tradition, 400-1400. Yale University Press, 1999, 67&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] between approximately 800 AD and 1200 AD. [[codex|Codices]], [[paganism|pagan]] and [[Christian]] texts, and educational material were written in Carolingian minuscule throughout the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The script developed into [[blackletter]] and became obsolete, though its revival in the [[Italian Renaissance]] forms the basis of more recent scripts.

==Creation==
[[File:Minuscule caroline.jpg|thumb|Page of text (folio 160v) from a Carolingian Gospel Book (British Library, MS Add. 11848), written in Carolingian minuscule. Text is [[Vulgate]] [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 23:15-26.]]

The script is derived from [[Uncial script|Roman half uncial]] and the [[insular script]]s that were being used in Irish and English monasteries.  The strong influence of Irish literati on the script can be seen in the distinctively cló-Gaelach (Irish style) forms of the letters, especially a, e, d, g, s and t.

Carolingian minuscule was created partly under the patronage of the Emperor [[Charlemagne]] (hence Carolingian). Charlemagne had a keen interest in learning, according to his biographer [[Einhard]]:

&lt;blockquote lang="la" style="font-style: italic"&gt;Temptabat et scribere tabulasque et codicellos ad hoc in lecto sub cervicalibus circumferre solebat, ut, cum vacuum tempus esset, manum litteris effigiendis adsuesceret, sed parum successit labor praeposterus ac sero inchoatus.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{quote|He also tried to write, and used to keep tablets and blanks in bed under his pillow, that at leisure hours he might accustom his hand to form the letters; however, as he did not begin his efforts in due season, but late in life, they met with ill success.}}

As a part of Charlemagne's educational and religious reforms, and made that every church and monastery should have a copy of [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate Bible]]. Charlemagne wanted to make the Vulgate Bible more readable for preachers and easier to copy for scribes. Thus, Marcia Colish explains;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Charlemagne looked first to Anglo-Saxon England for a scholar to head his court school, finding him in Alcuin (c. 730-804). He assigned to Alcuin the correction of the Vulgate. In conjunction with this project, and later in his career when he became abbot of Tours, Alcuin invented a new style of handwriting, the Caroline minuscule (Plate 6). This script was far more legible than earlier medieval hands and an improvement on Roman book hands, since it provided spaces between the words, more extensive punctuation, and a hierarchy of hands, with capitals used for titles, a mix of capitals and lower-case letters for subtitles or chapter headings, and lower case for the body of the text. With the newly corrected Bible, pastors would be able to base their teaching and preaching on what it actually said.&lt;ref name=Marcia /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Charlemagne was never fully literate, he understood the value of literacy and a uniform script in running his empire. Charlemagne sent for the English scholar [[Alcuin of York]] to run his palace school and [[scriptorium]] at his capital, [[Aachen]]. Efforts to supplant [[Merovingian script|Gallo-Roman]] and Germanic scripts had been under way before Alcuin arrived at Aachen, where he was master from 782 AD to 796 AD, with a two-year break. The new minuscule was disseminated first from Aachen, of which the [[Ada Gospels]] provide classic models, and later from the influential scriptorium at [[Marmoutier Abbey (Tours)]], where Alcuin withdrew from court service as an [[abbot]] in 796 AD and restructured the scriptorium.&lt;ref&gt;The production of the scriptorium at Tours was reconstructed by E.K. Rand, ''A Survey of the Manuscripts of Tours'' (Harvard University Press), 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Carolingian minuscule was uniform, with rounded shapes in clearly distinguishable [[glyph]]s, disciplined and above all, legible. Clear capital letters and spaces between words became standard in Carolingian minuscule, which was one result of a campaign to achieve a culturally unifying standardization across the [[Carolingian Empire]].

Traditional charters, however, continued to be written in a [[Merovingian script|Merovingian "chancery hand"]] long after manuscripts of Scripture and classical literature were being produced in the minuscule hand. Documents written in a local language, like [[Gothic language|Gothic]] or [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] rather than Latin, tended to be expressed in traditional local script.

Carolingian script generally has fewer [[Ligature (typography)|ligatures]] than other contemporary [[script (styles of handwriting)|scripts]], although the [[ampersand|''et'']] (''&amp;''), ''æ'', ''rt'', ''st'' and ''ct'' ligatures are common. The letter ''d'' often appears in an uncial form with an [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] slanting to the left, but the letter ''g'' is essentially the same as the modern minuscule letter, rather than the previously common uncial ''ᵹ''. Ascenders are usually "clubbed" – i.e. they become thicker near the top.

The early period of the script, during Charlemagne's reign in the late 8th century and early 9th, still has widely varying letter forms in different regions. The uncial form of the letter ''a'', similar to a double ''c'' (''cc''), is still used in manuscripts from this period. There is also use of punctuation such as the [[question mark]], as in [[Beneventan script]] of the same period. The script flourished during the 9th century, when regional hands developed into an international standard, with less variation of letter forms. Modern [[glyph]]s, such as ''s'' and ''v'', began to appear (as opposed to the "[[long s|long ''s'']]" ''ſ'' and ''u''), and ascenders, after thickening at the top, were finished with a three-cornered wedge. The script began to evolve slowly after the 9th century. In the 10th and 11th centuries, ligatures were rare and ascenders began to slant to the right and were finished with a fork. The letter ''w'' also began to appear. By the 12th century, Carolingian letters had become more angular and were written closer together, less legibly than in previous centuries; at the same time, the modern [[tittle|dotted]] ''i'' appeared. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Spread==
The new script spread through Western Europe most widely where Carolingian influence was strongest. In luxuriously produced [[Lectionary|lectionaries]] that now began to be produced for princely patronage of abbots and bishops, legibility was essential. It reached far afield: the 10th century [[Freising manuscripts]], which contain the oldest [[Slovene language]], the first [[Latin alphabet|Roman-script]] record of any [[Slavic language]], are written in Carolingian minuscule. In [[Switzerland]], Carolingian was used in the Rhaetian and Alemannic minuscule types. Manuscripts written in '''Rhaetian minuscule''' tend to have slender letters, resembling Insular script, with the letters {{angbr|a}} and {{angbr|t}}, and ligatures such as {{angbr|ri}}, showing similar to Visigothic and Beneventan. '''Alemannic minuscule''', used for a short time in the early 9th century, is usually larger and broader, very vertical compared to the slanting Rhaetian type. In [[Austria]], [[Salzburg]] was the major centre of Carolingian script, while [[Fulda]], [[Mainz]], and [[Würzburg]] were the major centres in Germany. German minuscule tends to be oval-shaped, very slender, and slants to the right. It has uncial features as well, such as the ascender of the letter {{angbr|d}} slanting to the left, and vertical initial strokes of {{angbr|m}} and {{angbr|n}}.

In northern Italy, the monastery at [[Bobbio]] used Carolingian minuscule beginning in the 9th century. Outside the sphere of influence of Charlemagne and his successors, however, the new legible hand was resisted by the [[Roman Curia]]; nevertheless the Romanesca type was developed in [[Rome]] after the 10th century. The script was not taken up in England and Ireland until ecclesiastic reforms in the middle of the 10th century; in Spain a traditionalist [[Visigothic script|Visigothic hand]] survived; and in southern Italy a '[[Beneventan script|Beneventan minuscule]]' survived in the lands of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] [[duchy of Benevento]] through the 13th century, although Romanesca eventually also appeared in southern Italy.

==Role in cultural transmission==
Scholars during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] sought out and copied in the new legible standardized hand many Roman texts that had been wholly forgotten. Most of our knowledge of classical literature now derives from copies made in the [[Scriptorium|scriptoria]] of [[Charlemagne]]. Over 7000 manuscripts written in Carolingian script survive from the 8th and 9th centuries alone.

Though the Carolingian minuscule was superseded by [[Blackletter|Gothic blackletter]] hands, it later seemed so thoroughly 'classic' to the [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] of the early [[Renaissance]] that they took these old Carolingian manuscripts to be [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] originals and modelled their Renaissance hand, the [[humanist minuscule]], on the Carolingian one.&lt;ref&gt;Berthold Louis Ullman, ''The Origin and Development of Humanistic Script''. (Rome), 1960, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; From there the script passed to the 15th- and 16th-century printers of books, such as [[Aldus Manutius]] of Venice. In this way it forms the basis of our modern lowercase typefaces. Indeed, 'Carolingian minuscule' is a style of [[typeface]], which approximates this historical hand, eliminating the nuances of size of capitals, long descenders, etc.

The '''catoblepas''' (pl. '''catoblepones'''; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] καταβλέ&lt;!--epsilon with acute accent--&gt;πω, (katablépō) "to look downwards") is a [[legendary creature]] from [[Ethiopia]], first described by [[Pliny the Elder]] and later by [[Claudius Aelianus]].

==Description==
It is said to have the body of a [[African buffalo|cape buffalo]]. Its head is always pointing downwards due to its head being heavy. Its stare or breath could either turn people into stone, or kill them. The catoblepas is often thought to be based on real-life encounters with [[wildebeest]], such that some dictionaries say that the word is synonymous with "[[Wildebeest|gnu]]". Also known as an African version of a [[Gorgon]].&lt;ref name="McGowen"&gt;{{cite book| title=Encyclopedia of Legendary Creatures |author=Tom McGowen | publisher=Rand McNally| year=1981| pages=28| isbn=0528824023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient and medieval descriptions==
[[Pliny the Elder]] (''Natural History'', 8.77) described the catoblepas as a mid-sized creature, sluggish, with a heavy head and a face always turned to the ground. He thought its gaze, like that of the [[basilisk]], was lethal, making the heaviness of its head quite fortunate.

[[Claudius Aelianus]] (''On the Nature of Animals'', 7.6) provided a fuller description: the creature was a mid-sized [[herbivore]], about the size of a domestic [[bull]], with a heavy mane, narrow, bloodshot eyes, a scaly back and shaggy eyebrows. The head was so heavy that the beast could only look down. In his description, the animal's gaze was not lethal, but its breath was poison, since it ate only poisonous vegetation.

==In literature==
The catoblepas is described in ''The Notebooks of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'':
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is found in Ethiopia near to the source [[Nigricapo]]. It is not a very large animal, is sluggish in all its parts, and its head is so large that it carries it with difficulty, in such wise that it always droops towards the ground; otherwise it would be a great pest to man, for any one on whom it fixes its eyes dies immediately.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The Temptation of Saint Anthony (Flaubert)|The Temptation of Saint Anthony]]'' (1874), [[Gustave Flaubert]] describes it as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...a black [[African buffalo|buffalo]] with the head of a [[Pig|hog]], hanging close to the ground, joined to its body by a thin neck, long and loose as an emptied intestine.
It wallows flat upon the ground, and its legs are smothered under the huge mane of stiff bristles that hide its face.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia|''The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia'' (''The New Arcadia'')]] (c. 1670–86), by [[Sir Philip Sidney]], the "forsaken knight" that Amphilalus fights has a Catoblepas upon his crest:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So passed he over into the island, taking with him the two brothers of Anaxius; where he found the forsaken knight attired in his own livery, as black as sorrow itself could see itself in the blackest glass: his ornaments of the same hue, but formd into the figures of ravens which seemed to gape for carrion: only his reins were snakes, which finely wrapping themselves one within the other, their heads came together to the cheeks and bosses of the bit, where they might seem to bite at the horse, and the horse, as he champed the bit, to bite at them, and that the white foam was engendered by the poisonous fury of the combat.  His impresa was a Catoblepta, which so long lies dead as the moon (whereto it hath so natural a sympathy) wants her light.  The word signified, that the moon wanted not the light, but the poor beast wanted the moon's light.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Catoblepas was listed in the ''[[Book of Imaginary Beings]]'' (1957) by [[Jorge Luis Borges]]. It is described as a black buffalo with a hog's head that is always looking down.

'''''Crazy in Alabama''''' is a 1999 American [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Antonio Banderas]], written by [[Mark Childress]] (based on his own 1993 novel of the same name), and starring [[Melanie Griffith]], [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]], [[Lucas Black]], [[Cathy Moriarty]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[John Beasley (actor)|John Beasley]], and [[Rod Steiger]]. The plot follows an abused housewife in 1965 Alabama who heads to [[California]] to become a movie star while her nephew has to deal with a racially motivated murder involving a corrupt sheriff. 

It  was filmed primarily in and around [[Houma, Louisiana]] with locations in [[Schriever, Louisiana|Schriever]], [[Chackbay, Louisiana|Chackbay]], and [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] as well as [[Las Vegas]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Los Angeles]].

==Plot==
Peter Joseph "Peejoe" Bullis lives in a small town in [[Alabama]] in 1965, at the height of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Peejoe's eccentric Aunt Lucille Vinson poisons her husband Chester to death after suffering years of abuse. She decapitates him and brings his severed head with her en route to [[Hollywood]], where she is convinced that television stardom awaits her. In [[New Orleans]], Lucille purchases a black hat box to store Chester's head. When a bartender on [[Bourbon Street]] insults her, she threatens him with a [[revolver]] and robs the cash register before stealing his car. Back in Alabama, Peejoe's uncle (Lucille's brother), Dove, a local funeral director, is notified of the incident. During her travels, Lucille becomes increasingly paranoid, convinced that Chester's ghost is haunting her.

Meanwhile, Peejoe becomes involved with a group of black students protesting the town's [[Jim Crow laws|racially segregated municipal swimming pool]], leading to a protest that explodes into deadly violence. A young black boy, Taylor Jackson, is killed by the town sheriff, John Doggett. Peejoe, the only witness, is pressured by the sheriff to keep it quiet. While mowing his lawn, Peejoe is struck in the eye with a rock; the townspeople circulate a false story that he was shot in retaliation for Taylor's death. The black townspeople stage a protest honoring Taylor in which they enter the town swimming pool. Peejoe and his brother, Wiley, join them in support, but the protest is interrupted by police and white pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederates]].

Lucille wins $32,000 in [[Las Vegas]] while playing [[roulette]] at a casino, and subsequently pays for a personal driver, Norman, to bring her to Los Angeles. She arrives in Hollywood, taking the stage name Carolyn Clay, and manages to land a minor role on ''[[Bewitched]]''. Back in Alabama, and Peejoe and Wiley attend a speech by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and Peejoe's racist aunt Earline grows infuriated over the publicity involving the family. While watching television one night, they are all surprised to see Lucille on television.

At an industry party in the [[Hollywood Hills]], hostess Joan Blake discovers Chester's severed head in Lucille's hat box. Lucille flees with Norman to [[San Francisco]], and tries to get rid of the head by throwing it off the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. Two policemen, thinking she is about to commit suicide, stop her and discover the head. She is arrested and escorted back to Alabama for her trial, where she is met by a [[media circus]]. In the local jail, Lucille is incarcerated in a cell next to Nehemiah Jackson, Taylor's father who has been jailed over the protest.

After being convicted of [[first-degree murder]], Lucille is sentenced to twenty years in prison. However, the sentence is suspended when she earns the judge's sympathies after testifying to the abuse she received, and she is put on a five-year probation with the condition that she seek psychiatric help. Lucille, her children, and all her friends joyfully exit the courtroom while the sheriff (through Peejoe's testimony) is put under arrest for Taylor's murder.

A '''''crux gemmata''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for: '''jewelled cross''') is a form of [[Christian cross|cross]] typical of [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] and Early [[Medieval art]], where the cross, or at least its front side, is principally decorated with jewels. In an actual cross, rather than a painted image of one, the reverse side often has engraved images of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] or other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;As on the Cross of Lothair. The Cross of Justin II has silver [[repoussé]] figures on the reverse.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples in metalwork are the [[Cross of Justin II]] (6th century, in the [[Vatican Museums]]), the 'crumpled cross' in the [[Staffordshire Hoard]] (8th century), the [[Cross of Lothair]] (10th century, [[Aachen Cathedral Treasury]]), the Iberian [[Cross of the Angels]] and [[Victory Cross]], and the [[Cross of Cong]] (1120s?, [[National Museum of Ireland]]).

==History of use==
In the [[Late Antique]] and Early Medieval periods, many objects of great significance, such as [[reliquaries]], were studded with jewels in a style that in recent centuries has been restricted to crowns and other [[coronation regalia]] and small pieces of [[jewellery]]. In the case of the cross, such decorative embellishment was especially common, and the jewelled cross is a specific type that was represented in paint, [[mosaic]], carved [[ivory]] and other media. The cross very often has splayed ends to its arms, but the proportions of the vertical axis to the horizontal one depends entirely on the needs of the composition, and varies greatly. [[Pendilia]], or hanging jewels or ornaments, may hang from the arms, especially the letters [[alpha and omega]] shaped in gold. The motif is first seen in a [[sarcophagus]] fragment from the late 4th century; the splayed ends of the arms are present from the earliest examples.&lt;ref&gt;Hellemo, 100-101. Lateran sarcophagus number 106 is the earliest work.&lt;/ref&gt;

In depictions of the cross, such as that in the mosaic in [[Santa Pudenziana]], Rome (384–9), the jewelled cross stands on a hill or mound with a backdrop of a panoramic view representing [[Jerusalem]], with the cross itself representing the [[New Jerusalem]] or "heavenly city".&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 104 and 139–140&lt;/ref&gt; The jewelled cross also served as a symbol of the Christian version of the [[Tree of Life]], especially when the arms are shown putting out shoots from their corners. The Staffordshire Hoard 'crumpled cross' has vine leaves showing at the corners and represents Jesus the vine. It is sometimes shown on a mound representing [[paradise]], with four rivers flowing down it (the four rivers were understood as representing the [[Four Gospels]]);&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 104; see Hellemo 93, note for an example of the four rivers symbolism.&lt;/ref&gt; a stepped base represents the hill in actual crosses or more confined depictions. The link of the cross generally with the Tree of Life appears frequently in the hymns of [[Venantius Fortunatus]].&lt;ref&gt;Wernher, 37&lt;/ref&gt; Sharp (2016) has shown the interlace on the front of the Staffordshire Hoard cross corresponds with the river or tree of life described in Revelation 22. 1-2.

For much of the period, a large jewelled cross is recorded as decorating the presumed site of the Crucifixion, around which the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] had been built. It was presented by the [[Eastern Emperor]] [[Theodosius II]] (reigned 408–450).&lt;ref&gt;Friesen, 10; Wernher, 36 has further details&lt;/ref&gt; The crux gemmata first appears after what was believed to be the finding of the [[True Cross]] by the [[Helena (Empress)|Empress Helena]], mother of [[Constantine I|Constantine]] in the early 4th century, when interest in the cross greatly increased. The paradox whereby the instrument of execution is rendered the vehicle of Christ's triumph in the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] remains to the present day a central theme in Christian devotion, and the jewelled cross was one of its first visual manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;Friesen, 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is clear that the cross was associated with Christians from a very early period, and the [[sign of the cross]] was made by Christians, it is rarely seen in the earliest Christian art, such as that in the [[Catacombs of Rome]], where there are only about 20 crosses, though the [[anchor]], which appears more commonly, was a disguised cross symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; There was resistance to representations of the cross with the body of Christ on it, a practice that did not begin until the 5th century, becoming more common in the 6th.&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 106–108&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest representations of a Crucifixion scene rather oddly shows the three crosses of the gospel accounts, with the two thieves hanging in place on theirs, but with Christ standing at the foot of his. The fierce [[Christology|Christological]] disputes of the period saw the [[Monophysites]], who rejected the human nature of Christ, objecting to the depiction of his body on the cross, and this influenced the use of the empty cross, especially in Byzantine-controlled areas such as [[Ravenna]], where several of the Emperors had Monophysite sympathies. It was the [[Nestorianism|Nestorians]], another [[heresy|heretical]] force of the opposite persuasion, who helped to popularize images of Christ on the cross.&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 108 and 145-6&lt;/ref&gt;

In so-called "mystical" images, such as the apse mosaic at the [[Basilica of Sant' Apollinare in Classe]], Ravenna (549), the jewelled cross stands specifically as a symbol for Christ.&lt;ref&gt;See Syndicus, 139–140 and Schiller, I, 148 for slightly different interpretations in detail&lt;/ref&gt; A poem by St [[Paulinus of Nola]] allows a reconstruction of a mosaic apse he had (as bishop) commissioned in the basilica of St [[Felix of Nola]] at [[Cimitile]] in the early 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Much of the basilica survives, but not the decorations.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole [[Trinity]] was shown, represented by a [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] for [[God the Father]] at the top, above a large crux gemmata with stars in a circular frame, so very similar to Sant' Apollinare in Classe, and below that a dove for the [[Holy Spirit]]. At the bottom of the [[semi-dome]] were twelve lambs, six on each side, with a haloed [[Lamb of God]] on a raised hillock in the centre, looking up. The bottom of the mosaic at Santa Pudenziana in Rome originally also had a bottom level with this.&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 138-9, with drawing reconstructing the Nola apse. For much more detail, see Hellemo, 90ff&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Solidus Marcian RIC 0509.jpg|thumb|A gold [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]] of [[Marcian]], 450–457.]]

The crux gemmata is commonly seen on coins, often held by a figure of Victory, especially in the Eastern Empire.&lt;ref&gt;See Hellemo, 98-101 for the interplay between imperial imagery of victory and the earliest images of the cross&lt;/ref&gt; Another common Byzantine coin type shows a cross with a stepped base, which should be understood as a ''crux gemmata'' even though scale does not normally allow any indication of gems.

[[File:The Curmsun Disc - Reverse.png|thumb|Victory Cross at the reverse of the [[Curmsun Disc]], Wolin, 980s]]

Contrary to the assertion of [[Dan Brown]] in ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; it is not especially typical for a cross to have thirteen gems, though when one does, it probably does symbolize [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] and His twelve [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]]. The apse mosaic in the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]] (c. 1220) has an example with thirteen jewels, but examples from the first millennium generally have more. It is not usual to use the term "crux gemmata" for crosses from more recent periods, especially for small crosses that fall under the category of jewellery.

'''''Dance''''' (''La Danse'') is a painting made by [[Henri Matisse]] in 1910, at the request of Russian businessman and art collector [[Sergei Shchukin]], who bequeathed the large decorative panel to the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. The composition of dancing figures is commonly recognized as "a key point of (Matisse's) career and in the development of modern painting".&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt;. A preliminary version of the work, sketched by Matisse in 1909  as a study for the work, resides at [[MoMA]] in [[New York City]], where it’s been labeled '''''Dance (I)'''''.

In March 1909, Matisse painted a preliminary version of this work, known as ''Dance (I)''.&lt;ref&gt;John Elderfield. ''Henri Matisse: A Retrospective''. The Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1992. Page 181.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a compositional study and uses paler colors and less detail.&lt;ref&gt;MoMA.org - [http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=79124 Dance (I)]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was highly regarded by the artist who once called it "the overpowering climax of luminosity"; it is also featured in the background of Matisse's ''La Danse with Nasturtiums'' (1912).

It was donated by [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]] in honor of [[Alfred H. Barr, Jr.]] to the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York.

==''Dance''==

''Dance'' is a large decorative panel, painted with a companion piece, ''[[Music (Matisse)|Music]]'', specifically for the Russian businessman and art collector [[Sergei Shchukin]], with whom Matisse had a long association. Until the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, this painting hung together with ''Music'' on the staircase of Shchukin's [[Moscow]] mansion.&lt;ref&gt;State Hermitage Museum - [http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/fcgi-bin/db2www/descrPage.mac/descrPage?selLang=English&amp;indexClass=PICTURE_EN&amp;PID=GJ-9673&amp;numView=1&amp;ID_NUM=2&amp;thumbFile=/tmplobs/FJ03FPM9BSK1VH$_406.jpg&amp;embViewVer=&amp;thumbId=6&amp;numResults=64&amp;author=Matisse,%26%2332;Henri&amp;comeFrom=quick&amp;check=&amp;tmCond=matisse&amp;searchIndex=TAGFILEN Dance]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting shows five dancing figures, painted in a strong red, set against a very simplified green landscape and deep blue sky. It reflects Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]], and uses a classic [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] color palette: the intense warm colors against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]]. The painting is often associated with the "Dance of the Young Girls" from [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s famous musical work ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''. The composition or arrangement of dancing figures is reminiscent of [[William Blake|Blake]]'s watercolour "Oberon, Titania and Puck with fairies dancing" from 1786&lt;ref&gt;http://www.william-blake.org/Oberon,-Titania-and-Puck-with-Fairies-Dancing.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; It resides in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in St. Petersburg. It was loaned to [[Hermitage Amsterdam]] for a period of six weeks from April 1 to May 9, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Hermitage.nl - [http://hermitage.nl/nl/tentoonstellingen/matisse_tot_malevich/de_dans.htm De Dans] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404105003/http://www.hermitage.nl/nl/tentoonstellingen/matisse_tot_malevich/de_dans.htm |date=2010-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Death and the Mother''''' ([[Denmark|Danish]]: Døden og moderen) is a sculpture created by the Danish sculptor [[Niels Hansen Jacobsen]]. Inspired by [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s tale ''[[The Story of a Mother]]'', it depicts a [[Grim Reaper]] figure, in a dynamic pose, carrying a [[scythe]], striding over a mother with a dead child crouching on the ground. The original plaster model is in the holdings of the [[Statens Museum for Kunst|Danish National Gallery]] while two bronze castings are located outside [[St. Peter's Church, Copenhagen|St. Peter's Church]] in [[Copenhagen]] and [[Vejen Art Museum]].

==History==
Hansen Jacobsen created the original plaster model in 1892, shortly after he had settled in [[Paris]] where he lived until 1901. His newly wedded wife Gabriela served as model for the mother crouching on the ground. The literary inspiration for the work was [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s tale ''The Story of a Mother''. When the sculpture was exhibited at [[Charlottenborg Palace|Charlottenborg]] in 1894, the catalogue contained a slightly modified version of the last sentence of the tale: "And she lowered her head into her lap. And Death took her child into the Unknown Lands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vejenkunstmuseum.dk/Dansk/samlingen/nhj/skulpturer/doeden.htm |title=Døden og Moderen |language=Danish |publisher=Vejen Art Museum |accessdate=2012-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914142237/http://www.vejenkunstmuseum.dk/Dansk/samlingen/nhj/skulpturer/doeden.htm |archivedate=2011-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model was first exhibited at the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris where it was well received. The next year it was exhibited at Charlottenborg and in 1899 Hansen Jacobsen gave the model to the [[Statens Museum for Kunst|Danish National Gallery]].

==Casts==
[[Image:Døden og moderen.JPG|thumb|200px|The cast at St. Peter's graveyard]]
After his return to Denmark in 1901, Hansen Jacobsen received a commission from [[Carl Jacobsen]]'s [[Albertina Foundation (Denmark)|Albertina Foundation]] for a bronze cast which was installed in front of [[Church of the Holy Ghost, Copenhagen|Church of the Holy Ghost]] in Copenhagen. In 1966 it had to be moved because the ward found it "profoundly depressing" and it was instead placed outside [[St. Peter's Church, Copenhagen|St. Peter's Church]].

Another cast was later placed outside Vejen Art Museum which had been opened to house his oeuvre.

==Description==
The portrayal of Death as the [[Grim Reaper]] was frequently seen in other artworks of the time, such as in paintings by [[Jean-François Millet]] and the Danish painter [[L. A. Ring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1638">'''Den Jyske Opera''', also known as the '''Danish National Opera''', is based in [[Aarhus]], Denmark. Established in 1947, it's Denmark's largest touring opera company, and the second only to the [[Royal Danish Opera]] in Copenhagen.

==Description==
Founded in Aarhus in 1947, the company staged two operas a year until 1977. It then collaborated with five provincial orchestras, staging some 100 performances per season. In 1982, Den Jyske Opera became based in [[Musikhuset Aarhus]], producing a number of [[Richard Wagner]]'s operas which culminated in ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Niebelungens Ring]]'' in 1982 and again in 1996. The company later performed a series of operas by [[Richard Strauss]] and, in 2001, several of [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Gyldendals_Teaterleksikon/Teatre/Den_Jyske_Opera|title=Den Jyske Opera|publisher=''Gyldendals Teaterleksikon''|accessdate=27 July 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funded by the [[Danish Ministry of Culture]], the company tours throughout Denmark staging both traditional and innovative operas while aiming at the highest artistic quality. With a permanent chorus of 65, it frequently performs with the [[Aarhus Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jyske-opera.dk/en/profile/|title=Den Jyske Opera / Danish National Opera|publisher=Den Jyske Opera|accessdate=27 July 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dicks''' were an American [[punk rock]] band from [[Austin, Texas]], originally formed in 1980. They initially disbanded in 1986 before reforming in 2004. Dicks are considered influential in introducing the sound of [[hardcore punk]] and incorporating [[blues rock]] influences into their sound.

The band went through two distinct incarnations in the early 1980s, changing its lineup when singer Gary Floyd moved from [[Austin, TX|Austin]] to [[San Francisco, CA|San Francisco]] in 1983. A version of its original lineup was revived when the band reunited in 2004. As a political band with [[communist]] lyrics during the [[Reagan administration|Reagan era]], they did not shy from controversy. Floyd was one of a handful of [[coming out|openly]] [[homosexuality|gay]] musicians in the 1980s punk scene.&lt;ref name="windy city"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/gay/lesbian/news/ARTICLE.php?AID=3405 |title=Gay Dinosaurs and Others |first=Gregg |last=Shapiro |date=2003-06-18 |accessdate=2008-08-12 |periodical=[[Windy City Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
Dicks were formed in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] in 1980 by [[Gary Floyd]], Buxf Parrott, Pat Deason and Glen Taylor. Their first single "Dicks Hate The Police", released in 1980, brought them much attention and is now regarded as a classic hardcore punk record.&lt;ref name="True"&gt;True, Christopher "[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p12754/biography|pure_url=yes}} Dicks Biography]", ''[[Allmusic]]'', Macrovision Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; In the song Gary Floyd sings from the perspective of a [[policeman]] who abuses his power by going after [[minorities]] and taking his anger out on civilians.

Dicks often played shows with fellow pioneering Texas hardcore bands [[MDC (band)|MDC]], The Offenders and The [[Big Boys (band)|Big Boys]]; Dicks' full-length debut was a split album with The [[Big Boys (band)|Big Boys]] entitled ''[[Live at Raul's Club]].'' Dicks were unique for their era in that some of their songs, such as "Saturday Night at the Bookstore" and "Off Duty Sailor", addressed issues of [[homophobia]] and [[sexual identity]].&lt;ref name="True" /&gt;

In 1983, Floyd left Texas for [[San Francisco]] and, with new members Tim Carroll, Sebastian Fuchs, and [[Lynn Perko]] (formerly of [[all-women band]] The Wrecks), a second version of Dicks began recording and playing.&lt;ref name="True" /&gt; The LP ''Kill From The Heart'' was released in 1983 on [[SST Records]] and ''These People'' followed in 1985 on [[Alternative Tentacles]]. The group disbanded in 1986, although occasional one-off reunion shows featuring the Austin lineup occurred through the '80s and '90s.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Influence on other artists==
San Antonio's [[Butthole Surfers]] ended their 1984 album ''[[Psychic... Powerless... Another Man's Sac]]'' with the [[cowpunk]] anthem "Gary Floyd" in tribute to the Dicks' bandleader.

Dicks saw a resurgence in popularity{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} at the onset of the [[grunge]] craze when [[Sub Pop Records]] released a cover of Dicks' "Hate The Police" by [[Seattle]] band [[Mudhoney]]. Soon after, [[Chicago]] [[noise rock]]ers [[The Jesus Lizard]] (three fourths of whom were also from [[Austin, Texas]]) released their cover version of Dicks' "Wheelchair Epidemic".

On their 2004 song "Ode", [[queercore]] band [[Limp Wrist]] paid homage to Gary Floyd, [[Randy Turner]] (aka "Biscuit") from The [[Big Boys]], and many others, as people who confronted homophobia in the 1980s punk scene by being openly gay.

==Post-Dicks projects and reunion==

Gary Floyd later started [[Sister Double Happiness]] in San Francisco in 1986.&lt;ref name="Strong"&gt;Strong, Martin C. (2003) ''The Great Indie Discography'', Canongate, {{ISBN|1-84195-335-0}}, p. 504-505&lt;/ref&gt; After that band ended he formed and primarily played in [[Europe]] with The Gary Floyd Band; an overview of this material, "Backdoor Preacher Man", is available in the United States. Toward the late 1990s, Floyd played in [[Black Kali Ma]], who released an album on [[Alternative Tentacles]]. Floyd is now in a band called the Buddha Brothers. Buxf Parrott and Pat Deason, of the original Dicks, play in the Austin, TX neo-bluegrass band Shootin' Pains. Perko went on to join [[Imperial Teen]].&lt;ref name="Beets"&gt;Beets, Greg "[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/AMDB/Profile?oid=oid:272292 The Dicks]", ''[[Austin Chronicle]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Parrott and Deason played in Trouser Trout and Parrott and Taylor also played in Pretty Mouth.&lt;ref name="Beets" /&gt;

Since 2004, Dicks have played a series of reunion concerts in Austin and elsewhere. The lineup for the shows consists of the original Dicks, with the exception of Glen Taylor, who died in 1997.&lt;ref name="True" /&gt; His role has been filled by three other Austin [[guitarist]]s: Mark Kenyon, Brian McGee, and Davy Jones. At the 2009 Austin Music Awards show, Jesus Lizard singer [[David Yow]] joined the band onstage for "Wheelchair Epidemic".&lt;ref name="Beets" /&gt; At the same show, Dicks were inducted into the Texas Music Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="Austin Chronicle Archives"&gt;"[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Awards/MusicAwards?year=2008&amp;category=Hall+of+Fame Austin Music Awards 2009-2009 Hall of Fame]", ''[[Austin Chronicle]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary film, [http://www.thedicksfromtexas.com The Dicks From Texas] was released in 2015 about the Dicks and Austin, Texas punk scene along with a tribute album [http://www.thedicksfromtexas.com/audio.html The Dicks From Texas and Friends] with 27 bands covering 28 Dicks classic songs.

The Dicks announced that their final show will be October 30, 2016 at Grizzly Hall in Austin, Texas, however due to popular demand, a second show was added the day afterward. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ww2.kqed.org/arts/2016/08/18/the-dicks-influential-american-punk-band-playing-final-show-in-october/ | title= The Dicks, Influential American Punk Band, Playing Final Show in October|last1=Jones | first1= Kevin | date=2016-08-18 | publisher= KQED | access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elitzur's theorem''' is a [[theorem]] in [[Quantum field theory|quantum]] and [[statistical field theory]] stating that local [[Gauge theory|gauge symmetries]] cannot be [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]]. The theorem was proposed in 1975 by [[Shmuel Elitzur]], who proved it for [[Abelian group|Abelian]] gauge fields on a [[Lattice gauge theory|lattice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Elitzur S | year = 1975 | title = Impossibility of spontaneously breaking local symmetries | journal = Phys. Rev. D | volume = 12 | pages = 3978–3982 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.12.3978|bibcode = 1975PhRvD..12.3978E }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is nonetheless possible to spontaneously break a global symmetry within a theory that has a local gauge symmetry, as in the [[Higgs mechanism]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''Ethiopian manuscripts''' are known to have reached Europe as early as the fifteenth century, perhaps even earlier, through Egypt, Ethiopian pilgrims to the Holy Land and through members of the [[Ethiopian]] monastery of [[St Stephen of the Abyssinians]] in Rome.&lt;ref name="D. Nosnitsin 2012"&gt;D. Nosnitsin, "Ethiopian Manuscripts and Ethiopian manuscript studies. A brief overview and evaluation," ''Gazette du livre médiéval'', 58 (2012), 2–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, travellers, missionaries, military personnel and scholars contributed to the development of collections outside Ethiopia. In Europe, the three biggest collections of Ethiopian manuscripts are in Rome (Biblioteca Apostolica Vatican), in Paris (Bibliothèque nationale de France) and in London (British Library). These three organisations together hold about 2,700 manuscripts. Oriental collections of nearly all significant European libraries also have Ethiopian material, with some still pursuing a policy of acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;V. Six, “Neuzugang von äthiopischen Handschriften an  die Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, Preußischer Kulturbesitz,” ''Aethiopica'' 10 (2007), 177-83.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Monasteries and modern institutions in Ethiopia have, meanwhile, maintained extensive collections and in some cases are still centres of manuscript production. [[Parchment]] (''berānnā'') was used for Ethiopian manuscripts from the time of the Four Gospels books of Abbā Garimā.&lt;ref&gt;Bausi, Alessandro, and Eugenia Sokolinski, ''Comparative Oriental Manuscript Studies: An Introduction'' ([Hamburg]: COMSt, 2015): 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Islamic manuscripts, paper only came into general use twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Bausi, Alessandro, and Eugenia Sokolinski, ''Comparative Oriental Manuscript Studies: An Introduction'' ([Hamburg]: COMSt, 2015): 155.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are eighty eight languages in Ethiopia according to [[Ethnologue]],&lt;ref name="Ethnet"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=ET ''Ethnologue'' page on Ethiopian languages]&lt;/ref&gt; but not all support manuscript cultures. The majority of manuscripts are in [[Ge'ez]], the ancient liturgical language of Ethiopia.

'''Catalogues''' of individual collections were written in the nineteenth century, with a key work for the disposition of Ethiopian MSS more widely prepared in 1995 and published by Robert Beylot and Maxime Rodinson.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Beylot and Maxime Rodinson, ''Répertoire des Bibliothéques et des Catalogues de Manuscrits Éthiopiens'' (DNRS Editions; Paris: Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Éditions, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that time, an online inventory has been developed that documents items labelled as “Ethiopian manuscripts’’ in libraries all over the world. This "[http://www.menestrel.fr/spip.php?rubrique694&amp;lang=en&amp;art=en Inventory of Libraries and Catalogues of Ethiopian Manuscripts]" was created in 2008 and is maintained since then by A. Wion, C. Bosc-Tiessé and M.-L. Derat from CNRS (Paris). The list of institutions below is a partial selection of the most prominent and best known collections, giving special attention to the individual researchers involving in forming the collections and those scholars who wrote the catalogues.

==Accademia dei Lincei, Rome==
The [[Accademia dei Lincei]] in [[Rome]] holds the collection of 138 manuscripts formed by [[Carlo Conti Rossini]]. The catalogue prepared by [[Stefan Strelcyn]] includes 30 further manuscripts in the Fonds Caetani.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Strelcyn, ''Catalogue des manuscrits éthiopiens de l'Accademia nazionale dei Lincei: fonds Conti Rossini et fonds Caetani 209, 375, 376, 377, 378'' (Roma: Accademia nazionale dei Lincei, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest manuscripts in the collections date to the fifteenth century with some having a provenance of [[Debre Damo]].

==Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris==
[[File:Saint Ildefonse BnF Ethiopien 60 fol. 7v.jpg|thumb|Miracle de Notre Dame and Saint Ildefonso, [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], Ethiopien 60 fol. 7v]]
The collections in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], held primarily in the Département des Manuscrits, have been subject to several cataloguing campaigns. In 1877 a catalogue was published by [[Hermann Zotenberg]] and gave an account of the 170 manuscripts then in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;H. Zotenberg, ''Catalogue des manuscrits éthiopiens (gheez et amharique) de la Bibliothèque nationale'' (Paris, Imprimerie nationale, 1877). Available online at https://archive.org/details/manuscritsorient00bibl&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethiopic holdings were subsequently enlarged by the three collections, those of d'Abbadie, Casimir Mondon-Vidailhet,&lt;ref&gt;For him see: http://data.bnf.fr/15411049/casimir_mondon-vidailhet/ Accessed Sēptembre 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marcel Griaule]] which increased the number at BnF to more than 970 manuscripts. Zotenberg's work was accordingly followed by a catalogue of the Mondon-Vidailhet collection prepared by M. Chaine.&lt;ref&gt;M. Chaine, ''Catalogue des manuscrits éthiopiens de la collection Mondon-Vidailhet'' (Paris, Ernest Leroux, 1913). Available online at https://archive.org/stream/catalogueethiopia00bibluoft#page/n7/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt; The Griaule collection was published by [[Stefan Strelcyn]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Strelcyn, ''Catalogue des manuscrits éthiopiens (Collection Griaule). Ethiopien 301-304, 675-687 Tome IV'' (Paris: Impr. nationale, 1954).&lt;/ref&gt; The BnF has the largest single collection of magico-medical scrolls in France, with over 160 specimens in the Griaule collection.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvain Grébaut and S. Strelcyn, ''Catalogue des manuscrits éthiopiens de la Collection Griaule'' (Paris: Institut d'Ethnologie, 1938).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bodleian Library, Oxford== 
The early collections in the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford]] came from [[James Bruce]], and consisted of 25 Ethiopic manuscripts purchased by the library in 1843. The collection soon grew to 33 manuscripts and these were catalogued and published in 1848 by [[August Dillmann]].&lt;ref&gt;August Dillmann, ''Catalogus codicum manuscriptorum Bibliothecae Bodleianae Oxoniensis. Pars 7 Pars 7'' (Oxonii: E Typographeo Academico, 1848).&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-nineteenth century the collection has expanded to 130 items. A notable addition in 2002 was an illustrated seventeenth-century manuscript of a Marian text, ''Arganona Weddase'' (‘Harp of Praise’) (MS. Aeth.e.28).&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved September 2016 https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/weston/finding-resources/guides/hebrew&lt;/ref&gt; The uncatalogued manuscripts were revisited in 2007 by Steve Delamarter and Damaqa Berhāna Tafarā.&lt;ref name="Delamarter Tafarā 2007"&gt;Steve Delamarter and Damaqa Berhāna Tafarā, ''A Catalogue of Previously Uncatalogued Ethiopic Manuscripts in England: Twenty-Three Manuscripts in the Bodleian, Cambridge University and John Rylands University Libraries and in a Private Collection,'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press on behalf of the University of Manchester, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==British Library, London==
[[File:Annunciation to Zechariah British Library Add. MS 59874 Ethiopian Bible.jpg|thumb|Folio from an illustrated Bible, Annunciation to Zechariah, [[British Library]] Add. MS 59874.]]
The founding Ethiopic collections in the [[British Library]]—74 manuscripts—came from the [[Church Mission Society]] and the materials that had been assembled by [[Karl Wilhelm Isenberg]] and [[Johann Ludwig Krapf]], missionaries and linguists who travelled to the country between 1839 and 1842.&lt;ref&gt;British Library, retrieved August, 2016: http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelplang/ethiopic/ethiopiancoll/.

MS Add 19,341. The book was purchased at the Arley Castle sale of 1852.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847 the Trustees of the [[British Museum]] published a catalogue of the Ethiopian manuscripts that were then under their care. This catalogue was prepared by [[August Dillmann]] and included 88 items.&lt;ref&gt;William Wright, ''Catalogue of the Ethiopic Manuscripts in the British Museum Acquired Since the Year 1847'' (London: British Museum, 1877), iii. August Dillmann, ''Catalogus codicum manuscriptorum Orientalium qui in Museo Britannico asservantur. Pars tertia, Pars tetra'' (Londini: Impensis Curatorum Musei Britannici, 1847).&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Library collections grew in 1868 when 349 manuscripts came after the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]] against emperor [[Tewodros II]].&lt;ref&gt;Rita Pankhurst, "The library of Emperor Tewodros II at Mäqdäla (Magdala)," ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'' 36, no. 1 (1973): 15-42. https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0041977X00097974  Stéphane Ancel, Denis Nosnitsin, "On the History of the Library of Mäqdäla: New Findings," ''Aethiopica'' 17 (2014): 90-95, dec. 2014.

Date accessed: 30 Aug. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; A catalogue of the enlarged collection was prepared by [[William Wright (orientalist)]] and published in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;William Wright, ''Catalogue of the Ethiopic Manuscripts in the British Museum Acquired Since the Year 1847'' (London: British Museum, 1877), iii.&lt;/ref&gt; Nine decades later, [[Stefan Strelcyn]] reviewed the manuscripts that had come to the British Library after 1877 and published a catalogue of them.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Strelcyn, Catalogue of Ethiopian Manuscripts in the British Library Acquired Since the Year 1877 (London: British Museum Publications, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The catalogue lists 108 items (some with multiple parts) and covers the general range of [[Ethiopian literature]] from Biblical texts to magical and divinatory writings.

The transfer of the [[India Office]] collection to the British Library in 1982 brought 6 further manuscripts to the collection, first acquired in 1842 by the India Museum in [[East India House]]. 

A further collection of 39 manuscripts came to the British Library from Roger Wenman Cowley (1940-1988). Cowley spent 15 years in Ethiopia as an Anglican missionary and teacher, during which time he assembled a collection of Biblical commentaries in Amharic.&lt;ref&gt;Kirsten Stoffregen-Pedersen, ''Traditional Ethiopian exegesis of the Book of Psalms'' (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1995): 2.&lt;/ref&gt; His MSS consist of copies on paper commissioned by Cowley and executed during the years 1967-77 (except for numbers 19-61, 32, 37, 40-42 and 44 which are copies made at different times in the twentieth century). Cowley used this material in his book ''Ethiopian Biblical Interpretation'', published in 1988. &lt;ref&gt;Roger W. Cowley, ''Ethiopian Biblical Interpretation: A Study in Exegetical Tradition and Hermeneutics'', University of Cambridge Oriental Publications, Published for the Faculty of Oriental Studies, 38, (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1988), review by [[Edward Ullendorf]], ''Journal of  Semitic Studies'' 15, no. 1 (1990): 181-183.

The '''National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene,''' commonly known as NYTF, is a professional theater company in New York City which produces both [[Yiddish theater|Yiddish plays]] and plays translated into [[Yiddish]], in a theater equipped with simultaneous superscript translation into English. The company's leadership consists of Broadway Producer CEO [[Christopher Massimine]] and artistic director [[Zalmen Mlotek]]. The board is chaired by Jeffrey S. Wiesenfeld, principal at Bernstein Global Wealth Management.

Folksbiene (Yiddish for the ''People's Stage'') was founded in 1915, under the auspices of the [[Fraternity|fraternal]] and Yiddish cultural organization [[Workmen's Circle]],&lt;ref name="History"&gt;"[http://nytf.org/history History]".

Rutgers University Press. p.&amp;nbsp;56.&lt;/ref&gt; The era when it was founded is considered to be the height of [[Yiddish theater]]; at the time there were 15 Yiddish theatre companies in the [[Yiddish Theater District]] in New York and many more worldwide. Due to the destruction of [[European Jew]]ry by the [[Nazi Germany|German Nazis]], the Folksbiene is one of only five professional Yiddish theatre companies still in operation; also in New York City is the New Yiddish Rep, and the others are in [[Bucharest]], [[Warsaw]] and [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

The company's 2006 production of ''Di Yam Gazlonim'', a Yiddish adaptation of ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', by Al Grand, was nominated for the 2007 [[Drama Desk Award]] for Outstanding Musical Revival, and their 2012/13 Off Broadway production of ''The Golden Land'' was nominated for the 2013 [[Drama Desk Award]] for outstanding Musical Revival. In the summer of 2012, Folksbiene announced their plans to create an international Festival of new works in celebration of  their Centennial in 2015. A play contest accompanying the festival was juried by producer Emanuel Azenberg; the Tony Award-winning composer and songwriter Jason Robert Brown ("Parade"), and the playwrights Joe DiPietro (Tony Award for "Memphis"); Obie Award-winning Israel Horovitz, and Pulitzer Prize finalist Jon Marans ("Old Wicked Songs").

A revival of the 1923 operetta [[The Golden Bride]] in 2015/16 drew press attention as a [[The New York Times|New York Times]] Theatre Critics Pick and garnered Drama Desk awards as well.&lt;ref name="SchleierRevived"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schleier|first1=Carl|title=A classic Yiddish operetta, revived for a new generation|url=http://www.jta.org/2015/12/08/arts-entertainment/a-classic-yiddish-operetta-revived-for-a-new-generation|accessdate=23 February 2016|publisher=JTA|date=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BaroneLostOperetta"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barone|first1=Joshua|title=A Yiddish Operetta, Once Lost, Will Receive Its Full First Staging in 70 Years|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/28/a-yiddish-operetta-once-lost-will-receive-its-full-first-staging-in-70-years/?_r=0|accessdate=23 February 2016|publisher=''New York Times''. nytimes.com|date=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Folksbiene was a producer on the 2015/16 Broadway play "[[Indecent (play)|Indecent]]."

In the Fall of 2017, the company staged a revival of Abraham Goldfadn's ''[[The Witch of Botoșani|The Sorceress]]'' as part of their restoration project – an endeavor that will restore lost or nearly lost Yiddish works to the canon of Yiddish culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theatermania.com/off-broadway/news/national-yiddish-theatre-to-revive-the-sorceress_83062.html|title=National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene to Revive Lost Yiddish Operetta The Sorceress|work=TheaterMania.com|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2017, National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene announced that it would stage the American premiere of [[Fiddler on the Roof]] in Yiddish, which has not been staged since its world premiere production in Israel more than 50 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/n-y-theater-company-will-present-an-all-yiddish-fiddler-1513888504|title=N.Y.

'''Geumgang jeondo''' (금강전도 金剛全圖) is a famous landscape painted by [[Jeong Seon]] during the reign of [[Yeongjo of Joseon|King Yeongjo]]. The title literally means "General view of Mt. [[Kumgangsan|Geumgangsan]]" or The Diamond Mountains).&lt;ref name="Koreandb"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ideal of Korean people: Geumgang jeondo |url=http://www.koreandb.net/OldPaint/op_sansu07_1.htm |publisher=[[Empas]]/ [[EncyKorea]] |language=Korean |accessdate=2008-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512235729/http://www.koreandb.net/OldPaint/op_sansu07_1.htm |archivedate=2008-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was classified as the 217th [[National Treasures of South Korea|National Treasure of South Korea]] on August 6, 1984. The painting is currently held and managed by the [[Ho-Am Art Museum]] in [[Yongin]], [[Gyeonggi-do|Gyeonggi Province]] and is owned by [[Lee Kun-hee]].

While many contemporaneous painters imitated the latest art trends from China, Jeong Seon ignored these to create unique themes based on Korean landscapes.  His catalogue of paintings of Geumgansan made him famous and the preeminent painter of his time at the age of 37.  He eventually painted around 100 images of the mountains which still exist to this day.  The artist’s love of the mountains influenced other artists to depict the Diamond Mountains and even encouraged mapmakers to make maps of the area.

Although Jeong Seon made many paintings of Mt. Geumgangsan, this painting is the largest and considered his best.  Like many of his paintings, Jeong Seon painted this landscape while actually viewing the mountains.  The painting is 130.7 centimeters in height and 94.1 centimeters in width.  It is painted with India ink.  The painting is of Naegeumgang, the Inner Mt. Geumgangsan.  The painting depicts a total of twelve thousand peaks.  The highest peak, Birobong, lies in the background and water flows from it toward a valley called Manpokdong which is divided from the left and right. The high sharp peaks are depicted by the artist with lines painted up and down while the artist used a dotting brush method to depict the earthen peaks, making them appear relatively soft and lush.  This composition harmonizes the contrasting sharp edges of the rocky peaks with the softer earthen peaks.
  
The painter included the title of the painting, some comments, and his pen name, Gyeomjae, in the upper right hand corner.  The inscription also dates the painting to 1734 when Jeong Seon was 59 years old.  The artist’s comments reads: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Even if you visit the mountain yourself and tread on its every nook and cranny, how can your joy be compared with what you feel upon viewing this picture from your bedside?''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''The International Biennale of Architecture in Kraków''' ({{lang-pl|Międzynarodowe Biennale Architektury w Krakowie}} - '''MBA''') is a regular architectural event organised in [[Kraków]] since 1985. Each edition consists of architectural competitions and a range of accompanying events like exhibitions, presentations and lectures. Over time it has shifted from being a biennial to being held in irregular years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sarp.krakow.pl/historia_triennale|title=Historia MTA - Stowarzyszenie Architektów Polskich - Kraków|website=www.sarp.krakow.pl|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mba2017.sarp.krakow.pl/historia/|title=History {{!}} MBA Kraków 2017|website=mba2017.sarp.krakow.pl|language=en|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first edition of Biennale of Architecture in [[Kraków]] was organised in 1985 by a group of Polish architects gathered in The [[Association of Polish Architects]] ({{lang-pl|Stowarzyszenie Architektów Polskich}} - SARP) on the initiative of Romuald Loegler.  The Biennale grew in importance following the [[History of Poland (1989–present)|democratic transition in Poland in 1989]]. In the 1990s Biennale became a unique forum for exchanging ideas and individual experience among the architects from all over the world. In 1994, the Biennale celebrated the astronomer, [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ulh&amp;AN=9406170715&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Visionary Monument for the Astronomer Who Shook the World|last = |first = |date = 1994|journal = Architectural Record|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 8 September 2015|volume = 182|issue = 5|page = 17|subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During different editions of the event, projects in competitions were evaluated by [[Wojciech Leśnikowski]], [[Pekka Salminen]], Julia Bolles and Peter Wilson, Francesco Purini, Eckhard Feddersen, Günter Schlusche, Hildebrand Machleidt, Armando dal Fabbro, [[Peter Cook]], Roger Hopkinson and many others. Invitged guests have included [[Frei Otto]], [[Jacques Herzog]], [[Pierre de Meuron]], [[Zvi Hecker]], David Mackay, [[Dietmar Eberle]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Economic and organisational constraints eventually made it impossible to go on with the original Biennale formula, although the name Biennale was retained.

In 2015, the Biennale celebrated its jubilee year, exploring the theme of "the human dimension of urban spaces."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thenews.pl/1/11/Artykul/210432,Krakow-to-host-jubilee-architectural-biennale|title = Kraków to host jubilee architectural biennale|last = |first = |date = 16 June 2015|work = Radio Poland|access-date = 8 September 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its most recent event was in 2017.

'''''Jimson Weed''''' is an oil on linen painting by American artist [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] from 1936, located in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], which is in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], United States. It depicts four large blossoms of [[jimson weed]], or datura. A similar work by O'Keeffe, '''''Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1''''', was sold by the [[Georgia O'Keeffe Museum]] at auction to [[Walmart]] heiress [[Alice Walton]] in 2014 for $44,405,000, more than tripling the previous world record for auction price of a piece by a female artist.

==Description==
O'Keeffe reiterated the pinwheel-shaped flowers' structure in the tight placement of the four blossoms in the painting. Her use of rhythmic light and shade and a simplified palette underscores their fresh, simple beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodman|first=Melissa|title=Datura flowers in art and images|url=http://www.flickriver.com/photos/96683394@N00/3938263553/|work=The Gifted Photographer|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical information==
O'Keeffe was immensely fond of jimson weed, ignoring its seeds' toxicity and allowing it to flourish around her patio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drohojowska-Philp|first=Hunter|title=Full Bloom: The Art and Life of Georgia O'Keeffe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQzD7mwpPgQC&amp;pg=PA376-IA20&amp;lpg=PA376-IA20&amp;dq=georgia+o%27keeffe+jimson+weed+1936&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mLJcHP6su5&amp;sig=MOQHdO9fD7w3ps7ApB5c-bvm4-o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=viSQUJUEqLfLAdbBgNgD&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=georgia%20o%27keeffe%20jimson%20weed%201936&amp;f=false|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|accessdate=14 November 2012|page=376|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; She paid tribute to the bloom in this painting, originally entitled ''Miracle Flower''. ''Jimson Weed'' was commissioned by cosmetics magnate [[Elizabeth Arden]] for the new Gymnasium Moderne of her [[Fifth Avenue]] Salon in [[New York City]]. Placed in the exercise room, the unfurling blossoms were meant to encourage clients in their stretches. Arden paid the exorbitant sum of $10,000 for the largest floral composition O'Keeffe would ever create.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|location=Indianapolis|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Should include other details  such as the symbolism to environment/ relevance to what was happening in society at the time. 
--&gt;

===Acquisition===
The painting was acquired by the IMA in 1997, a gift of [[Eli Lilly and Company]], who had acquired it from Arden's salon in 1971. It is currently on view in the Paine American Modernism Gallery and has the accession number 1997.131.&lt;ref name=ima&gt;{{cite web|title=Jimson Weed|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/jimson-weed-okeeffe-georgia|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lady Sings the Blues''''' (1956) is an autobiography by jazz singer [[Billie Holiday]], which was co-authored by [[William Dufty]].&lt;ref name=chronicle&gt;{{cite news|author=Hamlin, Jesse|title=Billie Holiday's bio, 'Lady Sings the Blues,' may be full of lies, but it gets at jazz great's core |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Billie-Holiday-s-bio-Lady-Sings-the-Blues-may-2469428.php|accessdate=April 6, 2015|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=September 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book formed the basis of the 1972 film ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (film)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'' starring [[Diana Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B07E5DA113DEF34BC4152DFB6678389669EDE New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The life story of jazz singer Billie Holiday told in her own words.  Holiday writes candidly of sexual abuse, confinement to institutions, heroin addiction, and the struggles of being [[African American]] before the rise of the [[Civil Rights Movement]].

According to an article in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', Dufty's aim was "to let Holiday tell her story her way. Fact checking wasn't his concern." Since its publication, the book has been criticized for factual inaccuracies.&lt;ref name=chronicle /&gt;

In his introduction to the 2006 edition of ''Lady Sings the Blues'', music biographer [[David Ritz]] writes: "(Holiday's) voice, no matter how the Dufty/Holiday interviewing process went, is as real as rain." Despite some factual inaccuracies, according to Ritz, "in the mythopoetic sense, Holiday's memoir is as true and poignant as any tune she ever sang. If her music was autobiographically true, her autobiography is musically true."&lt;ref name=chronicle /&gt;

In his 2015 study of Holiday, ''Billie Holiday: The Musician and the Myth'', [[John Szwed]] argues that ''Lady Sings the Blues'', is a generally accurate account of Holiday's life, and that Holiday's co-writer, William Dufty, was forced to water down or suppress material by the threat of legal action. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' reviewer [[Richard Brody]] writes: "In particular, Szwed traces the stories of two important relationships that are missing from the book—with [[Charles Laughton]], in the nineteen-thirties, and with [[Tallulah Bankhead]], in the late nineteen-forties—and of one relationship that’s sharply diminished in the book, her affair with [[Orson Welles]] around the time of ''[[Citizen Kane]]''."&lt;ref name=NY&gt;{{cite news|author=Brody, Richard|title=The Art of Billie Holiday's Life |url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-art-of-billie-holidays-life |accessdate=April 6, 2015|work=The New Yorker|date=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subtitled "A Biography of the [[A40 road|A40]]" and with the strapline "A Journey from [[White City, London|White City]] to the [[Hangar Lane Gyratory]]" it tells the story of [[Western Avenue (London)|Western Avenue]], an [[arterial road]] in West [[London]] primarily through the words of its residents whom the author visited between 1995 and 1998. At this time many of the houses on the road were being [[Compulsory purchase in England and Wales|compulsorily purchased]] and demolished in preparation for a road widening scheme which was later cancelled. Interspersed with the views of the residents are historical accounts of the road's development and wider views on town planning and traffic management, prominently those of [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Robert Moses]].

[[File:Groud Magie Noire.jpg|thumb|''Gilbert G. Groud'' signs "Magie Noire", 20 March 2006, [[Switzerland]]]]

'''"Magie Noire"''' ("[[Black Magic]]") is a [[comics]] series by the [[Côte d'Ivoire|Ivorian]] painter and author [[Gilbert G. Groud]]. It deals with the dangers of black magic in [[Africa]].

The story is about a father who is married to several women. His favourite wife Zoé has only one child. In order to proceed in sorcery and earn a position of higher power he is required to sacrifice this last son. The child is sacrificed in the world of ghosts. In the real world he falls very sick and throws up daily. The mother, who is not into Black Magic, takes the child to a hospital. The doctors can not find out what is wrong. Still the situation of the child worsens.

The illustrations were drawn by hand with ink. The mood is sad and dark which can also be seen in the pictures that are painted in green and brown. Pictures showing the real world are suddenly painted in bright colors. This contrast shows the difference between the real world and the frightening, dangerous world of ghosts.

Groud converted to [[Christianity]] in 1985 but comes from a family that practised sorcery. His point of view is a very critical one.

'''''Malle Babbe''''' is a painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Frans Hals]], painted between 1633 and 1635 and now in the [[Gemäldegalerie]], [[Berlin]]. The painting has also been titled as ''Hille Bobbe'' or the ''Witch of Haarlem''. It was traditionally interpreted as a [[tronie]], or [[genre painting]] in a portrait format, depicting a mythic witch-figure. The painting is now often identified as a genre-style portrait of a specific individual from [[Haarlem]], known as Malle (meaning "crazy") Babbe, who may have been an alcoholic or suffered from a mental illness.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt;

The painting has been an object of artistic admiration from Hals's lifetime, as there are several copies and variants painted by his followers. It was admired by [[Gustave Courbet]], who made a copy of it in 1869 while it was on view in [[Munich]].&lt;ref name=Slive&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slive|first=Seymour|title=On the Meaning of Frans Hals' 'Malle Babbe'|journal=The Burlington Magazine|date=October 1963|volume=105|issue=727|pages=432, 434–436|jstor=874065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting ==
The [[painting]] measures 75 × 64&amp;nbsp;cm and shows the face of a smiling woman, sitting at the corner of a table, apparently talking or laughing at someone or something to the right of the canvas. With her right hand, the woman is gripping a [[pewter]] beer mug with an opened lid. An [[owl]] sits on the woman’s left shoulder. The clothing of the woman is simple and corresponds with the mode around 1630 in Haarlem. Her face is animated in an almost manic grimace. The very free handling of paint is typical of Hals' style, and not very different from that on his more formal commissioned portraits.

==Name==
The painting was for a long time mislabelled as ''Hille Bobbe'' (alternatively ''The Witch of Haarlem'') through a misreading of the inscription on the back of the picture frame which in fact reads ''Malle Babbe van Haerlem … Fr[a]ns Hals'' (Malle Babbe of Haarlem).
[[Image:Frans Hals Malle Babbe Inschrift.jpg|thumb|400px|Inscription to verso: ''Malle Babbe van Haerlem … Fr[a]ns Hals']]
Under the witch interpretation, the owl was considered a possible [[familiar spirit|familiar]]. However the subject matter of Frans Hals in his other paintings would suggest that the painting is probably of a pub scene, in which case the owl would reflect the Dutch proverb, "drunk as an owl."&lt;ref name=Met&gt;{{cite web|title=Malle Babbe, Style of Frans Hals|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110001071|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in the [[Netherlands]] municipality of [[Haarlem]] showed that a real Malle Babbe actually existed, named Barbara Claes.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt; She was included in a list of residents of the local hospital called [[Het Dolhuys]], situated outside the city walls, which served people who were dangerous to themselves or to society, as well as a hospice for travellers arriving after the city gates had closed.  Around 1642, Pieter Hals, a son of Frans Hals, was also in this hospice. Hals and this Malle Babbe had probably already met by this time, as she was evidently a known personality in Haarlem, although none other of her biographical details survive except that she died in 1663. In Dutch the adjective "Malle" signifies "loony" and it is not uncommon to see painters or writers depict this type of village figure. In this type of depiction one can find a record of unbalanced figures of society as belonging to the scenery of everyday life, or the artist may enjoy exploring the thin line between sanity and lunacy.

== Other paintings ==
[[File:Umkreis Frans Hals New Yorker Malle Babbe.jpg|thumb|250px|''Malle Babbe'', Oil on canvas, 74.9 x 61 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art]]
The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]] is in possession of a similar painting. It is not clear who the creator of this painting is. In the past it was also attributed to Frans Hals, but it is now thought to be the work of one of his pupils.&lt;ref name=Met/&gt;

Another variant depicts Malle Babbe accompanied by a male drinker. There are two paintings of unknown authorship in which she is depicted with a male figure adapted from a work by [[Adriaen Brouwer]]. Both figures are depicted behind a table full of fish.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, Seymour Slive, ''Frans Hals'', 3 volumes, Phaidon Press Ltd., London, 1974, p.141.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also two portraits apparently depicting Babbe, but without the owl.&lt;ref&gt;Slive 1974 Volume 3 page 141-142&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, the painting also gave its name to a well-known song, written by [[Boudewijn de Groot]] and [[Lennaert Nijgh]] and first performed in 1973 by [[Rob de Nijs]]. The actual subject of the song "Malle Babbe" however was inspired by another painting by Frans Hals, ''[[The Gypsy Girl]]'', depicting a busty young woman, possibly a prostitute.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Voskuil: ''Testament. Leven en werk van Lennaert Nijgh'', Kats, 2007, {{ISBN|9789071359057}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The song celebrates her lusty sexuality. However, it also refers to her having frothy beer in a tavern, the setting for ''Malle Babbe'', not ''The Gypsy Girl''. Both pictures were seen by Nijgh in a 1962 exhibition.

'''Maria Leach''' (April 30, 1892 – May 22, 1977) was an American writer and editor of books on folklores of the world. A noted scholar, she compiled and edited a major reference work on [[folklore]] and was the author or editor of thirteen books for adults, young people, and children.&lt;ref name=shelburne/&gt;

==Early life, education, and marriage==

Born in [[New York City]], Maria Leach was the former Alice-Mary Doane, daughter of Benjamin H. Doane and Mary (Davis) Doane.&lt;ref&gt;Mrs. Maria Doane Leach" (obituary), ''Cape Breton Post'', Sydney, Nova Scotia, 30 May 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a native of [[Nova Scotia]], one of Canada's three Maritime provinces. Born in [[Barrington, Nova Scotia (community)|Barrington]], in [[Shelburne County, Nova Scotia|Shelburne County]], he was a descendent of the venerable family called Doane (an Anglicized form of a Gaelic name common in southern Ireland since the 1500s).&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hanks, ''Dictionary of American Family Names,'' vol. 1 (New York: Oxford University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; In Nova Scotia he had connections to seafaring through his own father, a ship's captain. In the late 1870s or early 1880s, Benjamin Doane and his wife Mary, a native of [[South Carolina]] and an unreconstructed Rebel, moved to New York and established a home in [[Manhattan]], where they lived for some years and raised their children.

Alice-Mary Doane spent her youth and received her early education in New York City. Upon graduation from high school she went to [[Earlham College]] in [[Richmond, Indiana|Richmond]], [[Indiana]], whose curriculum was shaped by the perspective of the [[Quakers|Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers). She then went on to study for a master's degree in anthropology at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign]]. There she met MacEdward Leach, a student of medieval literature and philology with a strong interest in folklore. His fascination with the oral tradition of medieval folk tales was shared by Alice-Mary, who by then was known as Maria (pronounced "Ma-RYE-uh" in the British fashion), which she had adopted as a pen name. After MacEdward Leach earned a bachelor's degree in 1916 and completed his military service in [[World War I]], he and Maria married in 1917 and moved to [[Baltimore]], where both of them pursued graduate studies at [[Johns Hopkins University]].

MacEdward Leach earned a master's degree at Johns Hopkings that same year, 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mun.ca/folklore/leach/biography/personal.htm "Personal Life"], ''MacEdward Leach and the Songs of Atlantic Canada'' (www.mun.ca/folklore/leach), a website produced at the Memorial University of Newfoundland, Saint John's, Newfoundland and Labrador.&lt;/ref&gt; Maria continued her studies toward a doctorate in folklore in 1918–19.&lt;ref name=shelburne/&gt; In 1920 he entered the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia]] and began teaching as an instructor of English. Not long after, in 1924, the Leaches became the parents of a son, Macdonald, their only child. As a young father, MacEdward Leach obtained his doctorate in English in 1930 and joined the faculty of the university in 1931 as an assistant professor of English.

==Later life and professional career==

In 1936, Maria Leach found employment in the Philadelphia offices of [[Funk &amp; Wagnalls]], a scholarly publishing firm. As working parents, the Leaches then set up house in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County]], [[Pennsylvania]], and some years later, once their son was away at boarding school, decided to follow mostly independent pathways. While he remained in Pennsylvania, she moved back to New York, returning to their home in Bucks County for occasional weekends. MacEdward Leach would subsequently devote his entire career to teaching and working at the university, where, among other accomplishments, he founded the program in folklore.&lt;ref&gt;Rosina S. Miller, "Of Politics, Disciplines, and Scholars: MacEdward Leach and the Founding of the Folklore Program at the University of Pennsylvania", ''The Folklore Historian'', 20 (2003): 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria Leach also continued to work in the burgeoning field of folklore. Having resettled in Manhattan, in [[Greenwich Village]], she worked  in the New York offices of Funk &amp; Wagnalls as a dictionary editor. There, after her amicable divorce from MacEdward Leach in the mid-1940s, she compiled and edited the major reference work on folklore, [[mythology]], and [[legend]] for which she is best known. From 1953 to 1958 she was a textbook editor at [[McGraw-Hill Book Company]]. During this time, in 1954, she wrote the first of what would become a substantial list of published works. In the late 1950s, she decided to retire and move to Nova Scotia. Her connection to the people of [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]] led her to establish residence in Shelburne County, at first in Barrington, in the Doane's family home, and then, finally, at [[Coffinscroft, Nova Scotia|Coffinscroft]]. A folklorist of international renown, she was still actively engaged in writing at the time of her death in 1977.&lt;ref name=shelburne/&gt;

During her lifetime, Maria Leach was a prominent member of the [[American Folklore Society]], for which she served as councilor. She also held memberships in the [[American Anthropological Association]], the [[American Dialect Society]], the Northeast Folklore Society, the [[Society for Ethnomusicology]], the American Indian Ethnohistoric Conference, and the Religious Society of Friends. In Nova Scotia, she was active in the Canadian Folklore Society and the Cape Breton Historical Society.&lt;ref&gt;"Maria Leach, biography", archives of the American Folklore Society, Columbus, Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Numbers''''' (stylized as '''''NUMB3RS''''')  is an American [[crime drama]] [[television series]] that ran on [[CBS]] from January 23, 2005, to March 12, 2010. The series was created by [[Nicolas Falacci]] and [[Cheryl Heuton]], and follows [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Special Agent]] [[Don Eppes]] ([[Rob Morrow]]) and his brother [[Charlie Eppes]] ([[David Krumholtz]]), a college mathematics professor and prodigy who helps Don solve crimes for the FBI. Brothers [[Ridley Scott|Ridley]] and [[Tony Scott]] produced ''Numbers''; its production companies are the Scott brothers' [[Scott Free Productions]] and [[CBS Television Studios]] (originally [[Paramount Network Television]], and later [[CBS Paramount Network Television]]).

The show focuses equally on the relationships among Don Eppes, his brother Charlie Eppes, and their father, [[Alan Eppes]] ([[Judd Hirsch]]), and on the brothers' efforts to fight crime, normally in Los Angeles. A typical episode begins with a crime, which is subsequently investigated by a team of FBI agents led by Don and [[Mathematical modeling|mathematically modeled]] by Charlie, with the help of [[Larry Fleinhardt]] ([[Peter MacNicol]]) and [[Amita Ramanujan]] ([[Navi Rawat]]). The insights provided by Charlie's mathematics were always in some way crucial to solving the crime.

On May 18, 2010, CBS announced that ''Numbers'' had been canceled after six seasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/05/report-cbs-cancels-ghost-whisperer-numbers-and-five-more-shows.html "Report: CBS cancels 'Ghost Whisperer,' 'Numbers' and five more shows"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111044100/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/05/report-cbs-cancels-ghost-whisperer-numbers-and-five-more-shows.html |date=2010-11-11 }}. [[Zap2It]] May 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast and characters==
{{Main|List of Numbers characters}}
The show revolved around three intersecting groups of characters: the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], scientists at the fictitious California Institute of Science (CalSci), and the Eppes family.

* [[Don Eppes]] ([[Rob Morrow]]), Charlie's older brother, is the lead [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI agent]] at the Los Angeles Violent Crimes Squad.
* [[Professor|Prof.]] [[Charlie Eppes]] ([[David Krumholtz]]) is a [[mathematician|mathematical genius]] who, in addition to teaching at CalSci, consults for the FBI and [[National Security Agency|NSA]].
* [[Alan Eppes]] ([[Judd Hirsch]]) is a former [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] [[Urban planner|city planner]], a widower, and the father of both Charlie and Don Eppes. Alan lives in a historic two-story house (filmed at [https://www.google.com/maps/place/2515+4th+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90018/@34.034002,-118.3238247,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x80c2b869ec3fde99:0x627e93a3a95a80da 2525 4th Avenue]) furnished with period [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] furniture.
* [[David Sinclair (Numbers)|David Sinclair]] ([[Alimi Ballard]]) is an FBI [[field agent]] and was later made Don's second-in-command and promoted to supervisor.
* Terry Lake ([[Sabrina Lloyd]]) is a forensic psychologist and FBI agent.
* Prof. [[Larry Fleinhardt]] ([[Peter MacNicol]]) is a [[theoretical physicist]] and [[cosmologist]] at CalSci. Charlie's former mentor and now best friend, he also frequently consults for the FBI.
* Prof. [[Amita Ramanujan]] ([[Navi Rawat]]) is a mathematician at CalSci and an FBI consultant. In season&amp;nbsp;2, she begins dating Charlie, to whom she is engaged and married in season&amp;nbsp;6. Charlie was her [[thesis advisor]]. Her name is a reference to influential autodidactic Indian mathematician [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]].
* [[Megan Reeves]] ([[Diane Farr]]) is an FBI [[behaviorist|behavioral specialist]]. She was involved romantically with Larry Fleinhardt and left the FBI to counsel troubled young women.
* [[Colby Granger]] ([[Dylan Bruno]]) is an FBI field agent. Once thought to have betrayed his colleagues, he is now back in their good graces and confidence.
* [[Liz Warner]] ([[Aya Sumika]]) is an FBI agent, formerly involved with Agent Eppes.
* [[Nikki Betancourt]] ([[Sophina Brown]]) is an FBI agent with four years' experience in the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] and a [[Juris Doctor|law degree]].

Temporary characters on the show were often named after famous mathematicians. For example, in the episode "[[List of Numbers episodes|In Plain Sight]]" (season&amp;nbsp;2, episode&amp;nbsp;8), one of the criminals is named [[Michel Rolle|Rolle]] and Charlie's father mentions a meeting with a man named [[Julius Petersen|Robert Peterson]].

'''Opening:''' (Voice-over by David Krumholtz) We all use math every day. To predict weather…to tell time…to handle money. Math is more than formulas and equations. It’s logic; it’s rationality. It’s using your mind to solve the biggest mysteries we know.

===Season 1 (2005)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 1)}}
The first season run of the show aired between January 23, 2005, and May 13, 2005, at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Fridays. It sees the start of the working relationship between Los Angeles' [[List of FBI field offices#California|FBI field office]] and Charlie Eppes. The main FBI agents are Charlie's brother, Don Eppes, and [[List of Numbers characters#Terry Lake|Terry Lake]], as well as [[List of Numbers characters#David Sinclair|David Sinclair]]. Don and Charlie's father, Alan Eppes, provides emotional support for the pair, while Professor Larry Fleinhardt and doctoral student [[Amita Ramanujan]] provide mathematical support and insights to Charlie. Season One was a half-season, producing only 13 episodes. [[Sabrina Lloyd]] played Terry Lake, an agent, in this season; she was later replaced by [[Diane Farr]], who played Megan Reeves.

===Season 2 (2005–06)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 2)}}
The second season run of the show aired between September 23, 2005, and May 19, 2006, again at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Fridays. Season Two sees several changes to Don's FBI team: Terry Lake is reassigned to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and two new members join Don and David Sinclair: [[Megan Reeves (Numb3rs)|Megan Reeves]] and [[Colby Granger]]. Charlie is challenged on one of his long-standing pieces of mathematical work and also starts work on a new theory, Cognitive Emergence Theory. Larry sells his home and assumes a [[nomad]]ic lifestyle, while he becomes romantically involved with Megan. Amita receives an offer for an assistant professor position at [[Harvard University]], but is plagued by doubt as her relationship with Charlie is challenged and her career is in upheaval. Alan begins work and dating again, although he struggles with the loss of his wife, and both he and Charlie dream of her.

===Season 3 (2006–07)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 3)}}
''Numb3rs'' was renewed for a third season,&lt;ref name="season3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tv.com/numb3rs/show/25043/story.html?story_id=3543&amp;tag=headlines;title;1 |title=Voila! CBS renews 14 shows at once |last=Mahan |first=Colin |publisher=TV.com |date=March 6, 2006 |accessdate=August 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which began airing at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Friday, September 22, 2006, and ended on May 18, 2007. Charlie and Amita intensify their relationship, as do Larry and Megan, especially after Megan's kidnapping. Amita has troubles adjusting in her new role as a CalSci professor, and Larry announces his [[leave of absence]]—he will be on the [[International Space Station]] for six months, which greatly distresses Charlie. Charlie and his colleagues are troubled by Dr. Mildred Finch, the newly appointed Chair of the CalSci Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy Division, whom they learn has begun dating Alan. Meanwhile, Don dates Agent Liz Warner and questions his [[ethics]] and [[self-worth]], and receives counseling. Charlie sees Don's therapist and the two understand one another more. Despite Don's concerns, Alan engages in some FBI consulting with his knowledge of engineering, and Larry returns from the space station, disillusioned. The finale wraps up with a revelation that Colby was actually a double agent for the Chinese.

Noticeable changes from previous seasons include the removal of the opening credit sequence (credits are now done during the first segment of the show), the absence of Peter MacNicol's character for much of the season, and the absence of Diane Farr's character for a few episodes. Peter MacNicol appeared in the first eleven episodes before leaving for the television show ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', but returned to ''Numbers'' for the 21st episode of season&amp;nbsp;3 ("[[The Art of Reckoning (Numb3rs)|The Art of Reckoning]]"). His character's absence was written into the show by having him become a [[Payload Specialist]] on the [[International Space Station]]. Diane Farr, pregnant for most of the season, left the show for [[maternity leave]] in episode 18 ("[[Democracy (Numb3rs)|Democracy]]"); her character's absence is explained as a special assignment to the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].

===Season 4 (2007–08)===
{{Main|List of Numbers episodes (season 4)}}
The season premiere aired on September 28, 2007, in the same time slot as in previous seasons, 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time]].&lt;ref name="fall2007preview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs.com/primetime/fall_preview_2007/ |title=CBS 2007 Fall Preview |accessdate=August 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike|writer's strike]], only 12 episodes were initially produced. However, once the strike ended, CBS announced the show's return April 4, 2008, with six episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-cbsreturndates,0,7656374.story |title=CBS Sets Series Return Dates |accessdate=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season ended on May 16, 2008.

As this season starts, [[Colby Granger]] escapes from jail, and is revealed to be a [[triple agent]]. He then rejoins the team. Don and Liz break up halfway through this season, after Liz has trouble with Don's trust issues. Amita's parents come to visit, which becomes a secondary theme throughout most of the season. Due to her work at the D.O.J., Megan is conflicted by her work, and turns to Larry for help. Near the end of the season, Don's girlfriend from season&amp;nbsp;2, Robin Brooks, returns. Don and Robin then continue their relationship. Charlie attends [[FBI Academy|FBI training camp]] because he has been working with Don for several years and wants to better understand what his brother does. In the season finale, Megan leaves the team to move back to [[Washington, D.C.]], and Charlie goes head-to-head with Don about a case. This causes Charlie to send information to scientists in [[Pakistan]]. He is subsequently arrested and has his [[security clearance]] revoked, so he can no longer help Don on cases. At the end of the episode, Don drives away to another case and Charlie admits that giving up FBI work will be harder than he expected.

Several characters from previous seasons did not appear in season&amp;nbsp;4, most notably [[Mildred Finch]] and [[Ian Edgerton]].

===Season 5 (2008–09)===

The fifth season premiered on October 3, 2008, and the season finale aired on May 15, 2009.

Season five opens three weeks after "[[When Worlds Collide (Numbers)|When Worlds Collide]]" (season four's season finale), with the government dropping the charges against Charlie. Charlie gets his [[security clearance]] back after he and Don fight FBI Security Officer Carl McGowan. Don begins to explore [[Judaism]]. The team adds new agent Nikki Betancourt, who arrives shortly after Megan Reeves' departure. Robin is offered a promotion but turns it down. Buck Winters (from the episodes, [[Spree (Numbers)|"Spree"]] and "[[Two Daughters]]") breaks out of prison and comes after Don. Alan suddenly finds himself coaching CalSci's basketball team. David becomes Don's primary relief supervisor. [[DARPA]] tries to recruit Charlie, but he turns down their offer. Toward the end of the season, Don is stabbed, and Charlie blames himself for it. The aftermath of Don's stabbing causes Charlie to focus more on his FBI consultation work. Amita is kidnapped, and the team races to find her. After she is rescued, Charlie proposes to Amita. Her response is left unidentified.

The sixth and final season premiered Friday, September 25, 2009, at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/FallTV-CBS-premieres-1007227.aspx |title=Fall TV: CBS Announces Premiere Dates |publisher=TVGuide.com |accessdate=June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the season finale aired on March 12, 2010, 3 days before Hirsch's 75th birthday.

The season starts with the [[engagement]] of Charlie and Amita. Soon after, Larry turns down an opportunity to meet with mathematicians at [[CERN]], in [[Geneva]], and drops his course load for the following semester. This leads Charlie to realize Larry is once again leaving, and leaving all of his work to Charlie. Don learns that his former mentor is crooked, causing Don angst when he has to shoot his mentor. Charlie and Don learn that Alan has lost a substantial amount of money in his [[401(k)]]. After some delay, Larry leaves [[Los Angeles]], only to find a vacant piece of land for sale within driving distance of the city. Alan decides to return to work and finds a job as a software technical consultant. David asks Don for advice about career paths within the FBI. Larry returns from the desert with a new theory about the universe's fate. Charlie and Amita begin planning their wedding and decide to join the [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America|Big Brother/Big Sister]] program to practice parenting skills. They get married before their move to [[England]] to teach at the [[University of Cambridge]]. Don loses his gun, recovers it after it is used in some [[vigilante]] murders, and gets engaged to Robin. He also decides to leave the team, taking an administrative position within the FBI. Before leaving, Charlie and Amita decide that the family garage should be converted to a [[guest house]] so Alan can continue living with them. Leaving Colby, Liz, and Nikki behind, David departs for [[Washington, D.C.]], to take a position as an anti-corruption team leader.

==Representation of mathematics==
{{cquote|We all use math every day; to predict weather, to tell time, to handle money. Math is more than formulas or equations; it's logic, it's rationality, it's using your mind to solve the biggest mysteries we know.}}

Several mathematicians work as [[consultant]]s for each episode.&lt;ref name="wolfram_consultants"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.wolfram.com/2007/05/the_mathematica_behind_televis.html?lid=title |title=The Math(ematica) behind Television's Crime Drama NUMB3RS |first=Eric |last=Weisstein |authorlink=Eric Weisstein |accessdate=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hollywood_consulting"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodmath.com/projects.htm |title=Hollywood Math and Science Film Consulting |accessdate=2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Elizabeth |last=Weise |url=http://www.math.caltech.edu/USA%20Today.html |title=They're Calculatingly Cool |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=February 9, 2005 |accessdate=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual mathematics is presented in the show; the equations on the chalkboards are mathematically valid, and are somewhat applicable to the situations presented in each show.

A book entitled ''The Numbers Behind NUMB3RS: Solving Crime with Mathematics'' ({{isbn|0452288576}}; published August 28, 2007), written by [[Keith Devlin]] and Dr. Gary Lorden, a consultant to the show along with Dr. Orara, a physics consultant, explain some of the mathematical techniques that have been used both in actual FBI cases and in other law enforcement departments.&lt;ref name="devlin_book"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Numbers Behind NUMB3RS: Solving Crime with Mathematics (Paperback) |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] | ISBN=0-452-28857-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="redhawke_books"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redhawke.org/content/view/347/89/ |title=NUMB3RS Books and DVDs |author=Lady Shelley |accessdate=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the premiere season, the blog edited by Prof. Mark Bridger (Northeastern University) has commented on the mathematics behind each episode of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atsweb.neu.edu/math/cp/blog/? |title=Numb3rs blog |publisher=Northeastern University |date=2005-06-14 |accessdate=2010-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202040230/http://www.atsweb.neu.edu/math/cp/blog/ |archivedate=February 2, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wolfram Research]] (the developers of ''[[Mathematica]]'') is the chief math consultant, reviewing scripts and providing background mathematics for the show. Starting with season four, their website in collaboration with CBS is entitled "The math behind ''NUMB3RS''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://numb3rs.wolfram.com |title=NUMB3RS Episode 412-Power-Wolfram Research Math Notes |publisher=Numb3rs.wolfram.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One part-time mathematician consultant to the show has expressed concern with its use of mathematics, asserting that the math is inserted after the initial script and written to provide plausible sounding [[jargon]], rather than having consultants involved at all stages of story development.&lt;ref name="silverberg"&gt;{{cite journal
| last = Silverberg | authorlink = Alice Silverberg
| first = Alice |date=November 2006 |title=Alice in NUMB3Rland |journal=FOCUS |volume=26 |issue=8 |pages=12–13 |url=http://www.math.uci.edu/~asilverb/bibliography/numb3rland.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same part-time consultant offered criticism of the show's portrayal of female mathematicians and expressed concern over the appropriateness of the relationship between [[Charlie Eppes]] and his graduate student [[Amita Ramanujan]].&lt;ref name="silverberg" /&gt;

==Production==
The idea for ''Numbers'' was generated in the late 1990s when Nick Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, the show's creators, attended a lecture given by [[Bill Nye]], a popular [[Science education|science educator]].&lt;ref name="nye"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1137661,00.html|title=The Numb3rs Guy |publisher=Time Magazine |date=December 4, 2005 |accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premise of the show is similar to that of author Colin Bruce's reimaginings of the [[Sherlock Holmes]] character,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Jonas |first=Gerald|title=The Strange Case |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/10/05/bib/971005.rv102432.html | work=The New York Times |date=5 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the "[[Mathnet]]" segment on the children's television show ''[[Square One Television|Square One]]''.

[[Gabriel Macht]] was originally cast to portray the character of Don Eppes.&lt;ref name="Point of Origin"&gt;{{cite video |people=Cheryl Heuton (co-creator/co-executive producer), Nicolas Falacci (co-creator-executive producer), Ridley Scott (executive producer), Tony Scott (executive producer), David W. Zucker (co-executive producer), Mark Saks (casting director), Skip Chaissom (producer) |date=2006 |title=Point of Origin: Inside the Unaired Pilot |medium=DVD (Numb3rs: Season 1) |publisher=CBS Studios, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the original concept for the show had the events take place at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]];&lt;ref name="imdb_trivia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0433309/trivia |title="Numb3rs" (2005) Trivia |publisher=[[IMDB]] |accessdate=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this was later changed to the fictional California Institute of Science, commonly called CalSci. Scenes which take place at CalSci are filmed at [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech)&lt;ref name="imdb_trivia" /&gt; and the [[University of Southern California]]. One of the most frequent campus locations at Caltech is the vicinity of [[:Image:Millikan Library, Caltech.jpg|Millikan Library]], including the bridge over Millikan Pond, the Trustees room, and the arcades of nearby buildings. At USC, locations include Doheny Library and the Town and Gown dining room. Exteriors for the FBI offices are on the distinctive bridge at [[Los Angeles Center Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://us.imdb.com/title/tt0433309/locations |title="Numb3rs" (2005) - Filming locations |publisher=Us.imdb.com |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common location is the [[American Craftsman|Craftsman home]] of the Eppes family. The house shown in the first season is real; it is owned by David Raposa and Edward Trosper,&lt;ref name="craftsmanhome"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/17/home/hm-numbers17 |title=Arts and Crafts by the 'Numb3rs' |first=Christy |last=Hobart |work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 17, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although a [[replica]] set was used from the second season onwards.&lt;ref name="setfilming"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fanrush.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=15 |title=NUMB3RS.org forum |accessdate=2007-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title of the show===
The show uses the number three in its title instead of the letter "e".  In interviews with Tom Jicha of the ''[[South Florida Sun Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]'' and with Alan Pergament of ''[[The Buffalo News]]'', Heuton mentioned that the use of the number three in the title derives from [[leet]], a form of computer jargon that replaces letters with numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jicha|first=Tom|title=Doing the Math – CBS Hopes Its New Equation for the Crime Drama, Pairing a Detective and a Genius, Will Add up to a Hit |newspaper=[[South Florida Sun Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] |location=[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]|date=22 January 2005 | url= http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/107C960544014224?p=NewsBank |accessdate=26 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pergament |first=Alan |title='Numb3rs' Viewers Probably Won't Be Willing to Do the Math |newspaper=[[The Buffalo News]] | location=[[Buffalo, New York]]| publisher=[[The Buffalo News]] |date=20 January 2005 |url=http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/107C908EC4021785?p=NewsBank |accessdate=27 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Gary Lorden, a [[California Institute of Technology]] mathematics professor who served as the show's mathematics consultant, told [[National Public Radio|NPR]]'s Ira Flatow that it was created on a normal computer keyboard.  Lorden also mentioned that the use of the number three in the title can serve as a restriction in Internet searches about the series.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[National Public Radio]] |title=The 'Numb3rs' Don't Lie |work=[[National Public Radio]] |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=5 October 2007 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=15039360 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both entertainment reporters and psychologists noticed the title's spelling.  Some reporters, such as Joanne Ostrow of the ''[[Denver Post]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ostrow |first=Joanne |title=Networks are busy, it must be midseason |work=[[Denver Post]] |location=[[Denver, Colorado]]| publisher=[[Denver Post]] |date=8 December 2004 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-12-08/features/0412080046_1_jonny-zero-midseason-northern-exposure |accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the staff members of ''[[People (magazine)|People Magazine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff Report |title=Picks and Pans Review: Numb3rs |work=[[People (magazine)|People Magazine]] |location=[[New York City, New York]] |publisher=[[People (magazine)|People Magazine]] |date=31 January 2005 |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20146679,00.html |accessdate=26 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402111543/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20146679,00.html |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the editors of [[The Futon Critic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Futon Critic Staff |title=Numb3rs' Add Up to a January Premiere |work=[[The Futon Critic]] |publisher=[[The Futon Critic]] |date=29 November 2004 |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2004/11/29/numb3rs-add-up-to-a-january-premiere-17323/20041129cbs01/ |accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the staff of the [[E.

Lynette Rice of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' asked Krumholtz about the three in the title; his response was, "Isn't that annoying? I think it should be the mathematical symbol for [[sigma]], which looks like an E. I've been fighting that for weeks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rice|first=Lynette|title=Smart Throb|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|location=[[New York City, New York]] |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=14 February 2005|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1026706,00.html|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (The [[sigma]] (∑) stands for [[summation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Weiss |first=David J. |title=Review of Mathematical Symbols |work=Psy302: Statistical Methods |publisher=[[California State University, Los Angeles]] |date=21 September 2001 |url=http://instructional1.calstatela.edu/dweiss/Psy302/Symbols.htm |accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  Others used varying adjectives to describe the title.  The TV site [[Zap2it.com]] called it "their typographical silliness, not ours".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=dmason |title=CBS is counting on 'Numb3rs' |work=[[Ventura County Star]] |location=[[Camarillo, California]]| publisher=[[Ventura County Star]] |date=4 December 2004 |url=http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/1076B5146BD80512?p=NewsBank |accessdate=28 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brad Aspey of ''[[The Muskegon Chronicle]]'', stated, "No, that wasn’t an ugly typo you just read - “NUMB3ERS” (pronounced numbers) is the idiosyncratic title of filmmakers Ridley and Tony Scott’s astute and crafty psychological drama which shows that even math can make for edge-of-your-seat entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aspey |first=Brad |title='Regular' TV finally getting the message from cable |work=[[The Muskegon Chronicle]] |location=[[Muskegon, Michigan]] |publisher=[[The Muskegon Chronicle]] |date=28 January 2005 |url=http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/11406B3D9777EDE5?p=NewsBank  |accessdate=28 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ellen Gray of ''[[The Philadelphia Daily News]]'', said, "Some of you may have noticed that in promoting "Numb3rs," which premieres Sunday before moving to its regular 10 p.m. Friday slot, CBS has chosen to put a 3 in place of the "e" in the title….I won't be going along with this particular affectation, which slows down my typing and seems to be the graphic equivalent of the reversed "R" in Toys R Us.  So there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray |first=Ellen |title=Math Adds Up to Zero for 'Numb3rs' Star |work=[[The Philadelphia Daily News]] |location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] |publisher=[[Watertown Daily Times]] |date=22 January 2005 |url=http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/107CD076C5CB2884?p=NewsBank |accessdate=28 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still others had a more positive view of the title.  When NPR's Flatow asked both Lorden and Dr. Keith Devlin, NPR's mathematics reporter, about the title, both men denied creating the title; Devlin believed that executive producer [[Tony Scott]] originated the title.  Lorden stated that he initially thought that the title was "kind of hokey" but later saw it as "brilliant" and a "catchy logo".&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;  Jonathan Storm of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', in his review of the series stated, "You'd think CBS's new Numbers, which premieres at 10 tonight after the Patriots-Steelers football game, is just another one of those shows with numskull titles trying to draw attention to themselves.  But the "3" substituting for the "e" is actually based on a real thing"….  He later said that the show was "written by people familiar with the Dead Cow Cult".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Storm |first=Jonathan |title=Solving Crimes by the 'Numb3rs' |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] |publisher=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=23 January 2005 |url=http://iw.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/107D72D2F66DE363?p=NewsBank |accessdate=27 February 2015}}{{subscription required| via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;  David Brooks of ''[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Telegraph (Nashua, NH)]]'' devoted the majority of his entire review to the use of leet in the series title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brooks |first=David |title=C4n y0u r34d 7h15?

'''''Park of Laments''''' is a public artwork by [[Chilean people|Chilean]] artist [[Alfredo Jaar]], located in the [[100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park]], in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]]. The artwork consists of an enclosed park space in the form of a square placed within a square, the inner parameter being made from limestone-filled [[gabion]] baskets, and the outer from indigenous  trees and shrubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art &amp; Nature Park|year=2010|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-936260-88-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The park space is only accessible by a concrete enclosed tunnel. The installation has a landscape design that consists of over 3,000 individual plants species from 53 different genera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=Nicole|author2=Richard McCoy|title=The Outdoor Sculptures of 100 Acres: A Report for the Objects and Variable Art Laboratory at the Indianapolis Museum of Art|journal=Indianapolis Museum of Art|year=2011|location=Indianapolis, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Park of Laments'' is situated in the woodland area southeast of the lake in 100 acres.  The overall form of the park is a square within a square, one rigid and made of limestone-filled gabion baskets, while the other consisting of indigenous trees and shrubs.  Natural, minimalist wooden benches, made from kiln-treated poplar, are built into the edge of an amphitheater of stairs, vines, and stones. The viewer begins their experience by walking down a concrete platform flanked on both sides with limestone-filled gabion baskets and indigenous shrubbery.  During their walk, the baskets become taller in the form of a progressive step system that correlates with the actual topography of the landscape; the minimum height being at approximately 2’, and the maximum at about 12’.  At that point the viewer is taken underground through a dark, pre-cast concrete “box culvert” tunnel (made of nine individual segments, attached and mortared together) and walk towards the sunlit area on the other end of the tunnel.  The entire length of the tunnel is approximately 72’ in length. The visitor then proceeds up the stairs to reach the enclosed park area, where no other portion of the Art &amp; Nature Park is visible due to both the surrounding gabion baskets and natural woodlands.  There the visitor may sit or interact with the space and be surrounded by over 53 different indigenous plant species located within the installation (more than 3,000 plants total).

==Historical information==
''Park of Laments'' is a project that follows along the lines of Jaar’s Public Intervention series in which the viewer/visitor is an active participant within the environment and contributes to the underlying theme or concept of the project.  Visitors enter the work outside the park and continue through an underground tunnel.  Moving towards the light, they approach stairs that lead them above ground into the center of the park where they are greeted by an isolated, calm, and secluded area conducive to meditation and lamentation.  Like many of Jaar’s Interventions, the intention of the space’s design is to initiate a physical, emotional, and psychological journey within the viewer, ultimately drawing parallels between the experience of physical space and human emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frascina|first=Francis|title=News From Nowhere|url=http://www.alfredojaar.net/press/afterimage/afterimage.html|accessdate=2011-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location history===
This artwork was installed at the IMA in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheets.|first=Hilarie M.|title=100 Acres to Roam, No Restrictions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/arts/design/13park.html|accessdate=2011-08-28|date=June 29, 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist==
Alfred Jaar (b. 1956) is an artist, architect, and filmmaker who lives and works in New York and was born in Santiago de Chile. He attended Instituto Chileno-Norteamericano de Cultura, Santiago (1979) and Universidad de Chile, Santiago (1981).  In addition to Park of Laments, Jaar  has created more than sixty Public Interventions around the world. Alfredo Jaar incorporates photography, film, text, and sculpture into works that look to the relationship between ethics and aesthetics.  His works draw from first-hand witness accounts and research of issues such as toxic waste in Africa, gold mining in Brazil, and genocide in Rwanda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Art 21on PBS|title=Alfredo Jaar|url=https://www.pbs.org/art21/artists/jaar/|accessdate=06/05/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jaar has received many awards, including a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Award (2000); a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award (1987); and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts (1987); and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (1985). He has had major exhibitions at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (2005); Museo d’Arte Contemporanea, Rome (2005); MIT List Visual Arts Center, Cambridge, Massachusetts (1999); and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (1992).

==Condition==
In general, the maintenance, upkeep, and conservation of ''Park of Laments'' must be a cooperative effort and responsibility that is shared by conservators, grounds crew, security guards, horticulture personnel, curators, and registrars.   The multifaceted artwork requires the attention of various museum professionals in order to maintain both the physical and conceptual aspects of the installation.

The '''Phyle Cave''' is a small cave on [[Parnitha|Mount Parnes]] near [[Fyli]] (Phyle), a suburb of [[Athens]] in [[Attica (region)|Attica]], [[Greece]]. In [[ancient Greece]] it was the site of a sanctuary to [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and the [[nymph]]s. It is also known as '''Lychnospilia''' for the large number of oil lamps found in the cave. It has been identified as the cave which occurs in the ''[[Dyskolos]]'' of [[Menander]].&lt;ref name=lars /&gt; The cave was excavated in 1901.&lt;ref name=fowl /&gt; Three votive [[relief]]s found in the cave are now on display in the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]] of Athens.

Because of its use for the veneration of Pan the cave is also called the '''Cave of Pan'''. It was one of the five caves of Pan in the vicinity of ancient [[Athens]].

==Description==
In Attica most cave shrines dedicated to Pan and the nymphs featured a common type of votive relief. These show three females led by [[Hermes]], often accompanied by Pan and [[Achelous]] (for his association with water), within a rocky framework simulating a cave entrance. The female figures are often identified as nymphs or sometimes more specifically the [[Charites]].&lt;ref name=ridg /&gt; These reliefs were also found in the Phyle Cave and are now exhibited in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens as inventory numbers 1448, 1859 and 1879.

Number 1879 is particularly complex and interesting. The relief shows a mountain god, Pan, a [[satyr]] playing the [[pan flute|syrinx]] and Achelous with a [[cornucopia]]. They surround the familiar group of three females near a basin fed by a lion-head waterspout. The waterspout is pierced so that it could supply the water for the actual basin in the cave itself. Various dates have been proposed for the relief ranging from the middle of the fourth century BC to the first century BC, with the later [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] date being more likely.&lt;ref name=ridg /&gt;

'''Pilane''' in Klövdal, [[Tjörn]], [[Bohuslän]], Sweden, is an [[Iron Age Scandinavia|Iron Age]] settlement site and [[grave field]], dated to 0-600 AD. The grave field consists of approximately 90 ancient monuments, including [[Stone circle (Iron Age)|stone circle]]s, [[burial mound]]s, circular stone [[grave marker]]s and [[standing stone]]s. The site is under the care of the [[Swedish National Heritage Board]] and the land is leased as sheep pasture.

In the summer of 2007 the Pilane site started to be used for a seasonal [[outdoor sculpture]] exhibition: '''''Skulptur i Pilane''''' (''Sculpture in Pilane''). During its first year the exhibition had 60,000 visitors. The art activities are coordinated by the private, non-profit '''Pilane Heritage Museum''', which is financed by the entry fees.

The site occupies a prominent position, with extensive views over land and sea. The [[Basteröd rock carvings]] site is nearby.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10924">A '''radius clause''' is a form of [[non-compete clause]] used in the [[live music]] industry, in which a [[tour promoter]] stipulates that a performer, for a certain length of time prior to or following an appearance at a concert or [[music festival|festival]], must not hold concerts at other locations within a certain radius of the city where they are to perform. In essence, it gives the promoter a form of territorial exclusivity, ensuring that the performer does not book concerts with competing promoters and venues in nearby areas, which can undermine ticket sales for their main event.

Critics in favor of radius clauses have agreed with their intent to protect the investments of organizers into the production and promotion of music events,&lt;ref name=lat-coachellaafterall/&gt; and that they are a worthwhile trade-off for acts wanting to obtain the expanded exposure that a festival performance can provide. Others have criticized the concept, arguing that they effectively discourage major acts from performing in smaller cities, and are influenced by a profit-oriented mentality in the live events industry. In 2010, the state of [[Illinois]] also launched an [[antitrust]] investigation into the use of radius clauses by [[Lollapalooza]].

== Effects ==
Radius clauses contractually ensure that a particular act does not hold events at competing venues or festivals within a certain distance of a city in which they are scheduled to perform, for a length of time prior to and/or after the performance.&lt;ref name=lat-coachellaafterall/&gt; For example, a band booked to perform at a venue in San Francisco may be barred from performing in cities within a {{convert|60|mile|km}} radius of San Francisco, for 60 days, before and after the concert. These clauses intend to maximize ticket sales; as an act cannot also perform concerts in smaller, nearby markets, fans in these markets are forced to instead buy tickets for the act in the major market.&lt;ref name=lat-coachellaafterall/&gt;&lt;ref name=bohemian-dreaded&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hecht|first1=Anna|title=The Dreaded Radius Clause|url=http://www.bohemian.com/northbay/the-dreaded-radius-clause/Content?oid=2458475|website=Bohemian.com|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of radius clauses has been considered controversial by some venue owners—especially those who own small-market venues in proximity to larger markets, or those in markets with a large number of venues—as they affect their ability to book major acts. In the city of Chicago, radius clauses imposed by the city's major music festival [[Lollapalooza]] can make it difficult for venues and [[block party|block parties]] around the city to book major acts during the lucrative summer months. Similar effects are faced by the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]] in the lead-up to the [[Coachella Festival]], although they are not as pronounced as those of Lollapalooza because their radius clauses fall during the winter months.&lt;ref name=lat-coachellaafterall/&gt;&lt;ref name=bohemian-dreaded/&gt;&lt;ref name=lat-hiddencosts/&gt;

[[Dangerbird Records]] founder [[Jeff Castelaz]] argued that such clauses were a "reality" in the music business, and that in relation to music festivals, since promoters are &lt;blockquote&gt;putting up millions of millions of dollars to market and promote this festival, not to mention the money that they're putting on the table as guarantees for the bands, they have to have rules about people playing in the markets where they'll get their tickets from.&lt;ref name=lat-hiddencosts/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; On the other hand, while noting that festival appearances can be a significant milestone for an up-and-coming act rather than exclusively playing clubs, talent agency head Tom Windish felt that there was a mentality in the live events industry where "if you don't have 75,000 people at your event, it's a failure."&lt;ref name=lat-hiddencosts/&gt;

== Notable users ==
=== Coachella ===
The [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] uses radius clauses which, as of 2012, could prevent acts from performing in [[Los Angeles]], the [[Inland Empire]], or [[San Diego]] for up to three months before and after the festival. The festival has allowed some of its acts to make appearances in the region prior to the festival, but only at events and venues owned or controlled by festival owner [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (AEG)—such as [[Jay-Z]] at [[Staples Center]] in 2010. That year also marked the first time Coachella had ever sold out in advance.&lt;ref name=lat-hiddencosts&gt;{{cite web|title=Coachella and destination festivals: the hidden costs|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/04/coachella-and-destination-festivals-the-hidden-costs.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kpcc-bendrules&gt;{{cite web|title=Coachella organizers bend rules on bands playing non-festival venues|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2012/04/17/32062/coachella-organizers-bend-rules-bands-playing-non-/|publisher=[[KPCC]]|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=npr-coachella&gt;{{cite web|title=Marooned in L.A.

In 2018, the organizers of the  [[Portland, Oregon]] Soul'd Out Music Festival filed an [[antitrust]] lawsuit against AEG, alleging that Coachella had enforced radius clauses much stricter than previously reported. In its original complaint, the organizers stated that the restrictions had extended to the entirety of [[California]], as well as [[Arizona]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. In an amended complaint, the organizers identified that Coachella performers are forbidden from:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/festivals/8462036/coachella-radius-clause-details-exposed-lawsuit-oregon-festival |title=Coachella's Radius Clause Details Exposed in Legal Fight With Oregon Festival |first=Dave |last=Brooks |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard.com]] |date=June 20, 2018 |accessdate=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During a period that starts on the December 15 prior to Coachella and ends on the following May 1.
** Playing any festival in North America
** Playing any "hard ticket" concerts in Southern California
* Publicizing any tour stops in California, Arizona, Oregon, or Washington until after the Coachella lineup is announced.
* Publicizing any performances at competing festivals in California, its bordering states, and Washington, or a headlining concert in Southern California, until May 8.
* Publicizing any performances at competing festivals in the remainder of the United States (except for the [[New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival]], [[South by Southwest]], and [[Ultra Music Festival]]) until after the Coachella lineup is announced.  With respect to Nevada, they can publicize appearances at Las Vegas casinos, or tour stops in other parts of Nevada, but cannot publicize Las Vegas festival appearances.

=== Other events ===
In April 2010, it was reported that [[Illinois Attorney General]] [[Lisa Madigan]] had launched an antitrust investigation into the [[Lollapalooza]] festival's use of radius clauses.&lt;ref name=rollingstone-lolla/&gt; It was alleged that the festival had imposed radius clauses on performers that were so strict, that some acts were barred from performing within {{convert|300|miles|km}} of Chicago&amp;mdash;including cities as far as [[Detroit]], [[Indianapolis]], and [[Milwaukee]]&amp;mdash;for as long as six months prior to, and three months after Lollapalooza.&lt;ref name=lat-coachellaafterall&gt;{{cite web|title=So maybe Coachella's booking rules aren't so egregious after all|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/so-maybe-coachellas-booking-rules-arent-so-egregious-after-all.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rollingstone-lolla&gt;{{cite web|title=Attorney General Investigates Lollapalooza|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/attorney-general-investigates-lollapalooza-20100625|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the [[Toronto]] festival [[NXNE]] announced that it would drop a 45-day radius clause it had implemented for its 2014 edition, following protests by fans and artists (including a [[Change.org]] petition with over 3000 signatures), with a particular emphasis on its effects on emerging artists. NXNE 2014 marked the first time that it had been held just weeks after [[Canadian Music Week]] (CMW)&amp;mdash;which had moved to May from its traditional March date; the clause had been implemented primarily to prevent NXNE acts from performing at CMW.&lt;ref name=billboard-nxnegetalong&gt;{{cite web|title=How Canadian Music Week and NXNE Are Learning To Get Along|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/6084679/canadian-music-week-nxne-learning-to-get-along|website=Billboard|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=billboard-cmwradius&gt;{{cite web|title=NXNE, CMW Remove Radius Clause While 'Why NXNE Sucks' Panel Rages|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/6128814/nxne-cmw-remove-radius-clause-while-why-nxne-sucks-panel-rages|website=Billboard|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[South By Southwest]] (SXSW) was the subject of criticism for several controversial clauses in its performance contracts, including one warning that international performers entering the United States under the [[Visa Waiver Program]] to perform at SXSW would face threats of deportation and passport revocation if they performed outside of their "official" events (a large number of parties unaffiliated with SXSW are held in [[Austin]] alongside the official festival). Managing director Roland Swenson stated that this clause was based on U.S. immigration law; performing in the country requires a [[work visa]], but SXSW performers have typically qualified under the Visa Waiver Program because it classifies itself as an "industry showcase". Those who do perform under this clause are legally forbidden from performing any shows beyond the specific showcase they have been granted permission for. Some critics initially interpreted this statement as being a traditional radius clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6859106/uk-musicians-union-task-force-unequal-visa-system-uk-us|title=Task Force Assembled to Address an Unequal Visa System for U.K. Musicians|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/03/how-sxsw-got-pegged-as-the-anti-immigration-music-festival/|title=How SXSW Got Pegged as the Anti-Immigration Music Festival|date=2017-03-03|work=Spin|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation’s long-term aim is to develop 8 Royal College Street as a European-style "poetry house".&lt;ref name="Poetry house"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rimbaudverlaine.org/en/poetry-house/ | title=Poetry House | publisher=Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation | accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, it is using the two poets as an inspirational starting point for a much wider mission to champion arts and culture. Exploring the vital role played by the arts in education, [[social capital]] building and cultural exchange, the Foundation is also developing a new and more sustainable business model for the arts, based around earned income.

==History==
[[File:8 Royal College Street, Camden Town - geograph.org.uk - 430128.jpg|thumb|150px|8 [[Royal College Street]] in 2007, before restoration]]
[[File:8 Royal College Street.jpg|thumb|150px|8 Royal College Street in 2015, after restoration]]
The Foundation was created by Graham Henderson and was initially incubated within Poet in the City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/chasing-rimbaud/ | work=[[3:AM Magazine]]|location= Paris|title= Chasing Rimbaud | date=7 May 2008|accessdate= 1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson was part of (and inherited) the previous campaign to save the property at 8 Royal College Street. For many years this was run by Gerry Harrison, a [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] councillor,&lt;ref name="Patterson"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/verlaine-and-rimbaud-poets-from-hell-525605.html | title=Verlaine and Rimbaud: Poets from hell | work=[[The Independent]] | date=8 February 2006 | accessdate=20 November 2014 | author=Patterson, Christina}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the process of which many celebrities have rallied to the cause, including the actor [[Simon Callow]],&lt;ref name="Osley"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thecnj.com/camden/020906/news020906_14.html |title=French are urged to buy poets' home |last=Osley |first=Richard |date=2 September 2006 |work=[[Camden New Journal]] |access-date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the writers [[Julian Barnes]],&lt;ref name="Patterson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/dylan-called-in-to-help-save-poets-love-nest-on-londons-desolation-row-6106333.html |title=Dylan called in to help save poets' love nest on London's Desolation Row |last=Barnes |first=Anthony |date=19 March 2006 |work=[[The Independent]] |access-date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lisa Appignanesi]]&lt;ref name="Patterson"/&gt; and [[Tracy Chevalier]] and the musician [[Patti Smith]].

In 2007 the house was bought and sympathetically restored by a new owner, Michael Corby. Committed to the historic identity of the property, he agreed in 2011 to leave the property as legacy gift to the Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation, created especially by Graham Henderson for this purpose. The Foundation has always been clear, however, that it does not want to be just a small [[Historic house museum|house museum]]. It has therefore used the idea of the "poetry house" to create an arts organisation with the wider goal of promoting culture and the arts and championing their role in social capital building.&lt;ref name = Venning&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.rimbaudverlaine.org/en/new-business-model/are-arts-compatible-pursuit-profit/ |title=Are the arts compatible with the pursuit of profit? |last=Venning |first=Thomas |publisher = Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation|access-date=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has seen the Foundation deliver an extensive programme of cross-arts events and commissions and take an innovative approach to audience and business development.

==Events==

The programme of events delivered by the Foundation has been intentionally eclectic, involving many different art forms, and up-and-coming talent from across the arts and cultural sector. Amongst other things this programme has included events featuring opera, classical music, sculpture, poetry, literature, theatre, jazz music and rock music. Highlights have included ''The Disappearing Poet'',&lt;ref name="Disappearing"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1453827/ |title=Arthur Rimbaud: the Disappearing Poet |date=2014 |publisher=[[University College London]] |access-date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; an event exploring why poets disappear, ''[[Faure|Faure’s Verlaine Settings]]'', an event presenting classical song settings of the poet’s work, and ''Rock for Rimbaud'', a concert featuring Americana artists. Institutional partners have included the [[National Opera Studio]],  [[Bloodaxe Books]] and [[Pernod]] Absinthe. From 2018 the Foundation is organising a series of [[Salon (gathering)|salon]]-style events at Blacks Club in [[Soho]] in London, featuring speakers and artists, and designed to champion its work.

==Commissions==

The Foundation has also been responsible for commissioning new work in the arts. For instance, in 2016 it commissioned both a full-length jazz show (''Jazz from the Playing Card Factory'')&lt;ref name="LJN"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.londonjazznews.com/2016/09/previewinterview-romanian-pianist-sorin.html |title=PREVIEW/INTERVIEW: Romanian pianist Sorin Zlat (new commission From the Playing Card Factory, Kings Place, 10th October)  |date=3 September 2016 |work=London Jazz News |access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a full-length theatre show (''Poetry House Live'').&lt;ref name="Live"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://poetryhouseproject.wordpress.com/ |title=Poetry House Live |website=Poetry House Project |access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as several performances the latter has resulted in a full-length film made in partnership with the film department at the [[Royal Conservatoire of Scotland]] in [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref name="CCA"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cca-glasgow.com/programme/scottish-writers-centre-poetry-house-adapting-poetic-text-for-the-big-screen |title=Scottish Writers' Centre Poetry House&amp;nbsp;– Adapting Poetic Text for the Big Screen |year=2017 |publisher=[[Centre for Contemporary Arts]] |location=Glasgow |access-date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation has also been responsible for an original poetry commission involving a suite of poems by [[George Szirtes]], and a series of 24 paintings by the artist Rebecca Taber inspired by the poetry of Rimbaud and Verlaine. In 2018 the Foundation is seeking funding for, amongst other things, an original [[chamber opera]], and an original [[puppet show]].

==Educational work==

The Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation is committed to encouraging new generations of students in secondary schools in the UK to engage with the arts and literature, and to gain an international perspective. In particular, it seeks to engage with young people in local Camden and [[London Borough of Islington |Islington]] schools, located within a short distance of the property at 8 Royal College Street, many of whom come from socially and economically deprived backgrounds. The Foundation wants to provide these young people with experiences and educational opportunities they might otherwise not possess. This charitable mission lies at the heart of the Foundation’s identity, and forms an important part of its contribution to the local community.

In 2017, the Foundation delivered an extensive programme of educational placements featuring poetry in four schools in the London Borough of Camden, working with students from [[Maria Fidelis Roman Catholic Convent School]], [[Regent High School]], [[Camden School for Girls]]&lt;ref name="Camden Girls"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.camdengirls.camden.sch.uk/news/?pid=1183&amp;nid=115&amp;storyid=1222 |title=A Celebration of Poetry |last=Fearnside |first=Angie |date= 2017|access-date= 25 March 2018 |publisher=[[Camden School for Girls]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Celebration"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.camdengirls.camden.sch.uk/_files/342DF6759B4B7EC3E2E984C6F39A7A9F.pdf |title=A Celebration of Poetry |last=Fearnside |first=Angie |date=2017|access-date= 25 March 2018 |publisher=[[Camden School for Girls]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[La Sainte Union Catholic School]] in a programme that involved over 500 students. This schools programme was generously supported by the [[T.S. Eliot]] Foundation. As well as work in the classroom, it included school shows and the publication of an 89-page poetry [[anthology]] entitled ''How We Make Daylight'', featuring work by the students.&lt;ref name="Camden Girls"/&gt;

The Foundation is facilitating a repeat programme of schools’ placements in Camden in 2018, with poetry in translation as its main focus, which will be delivered by Modern Poetry in Translation.

==International connections== 
[[File:Kindred Spirits.jpg|thumb|200px|Delegates attending Kindred Spirits conference in [[Bucharest]], 2015]]
The Foundation has also been working internationally. In 2015 Graham Henderson and the organisation took the lead in creating the Kindred Spirits network of European poetry houses including seven arts organisations based in six different European countries.&lt;ref name="Kindred"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kindredspirits.eu/ |title=Welcome to Kindred Spirits|website=Kindred Spirits|accessdate = 3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation’s partners include the Rimbaud Museum in [[Charleville-Mézières]], La Maison de la Poesie in Paris, [[Residencia de Estudiantes]] in Madrid, the Lorca Foundation in [[Granada]], the Keats-Shelley House in Rome, the National Museum of Literature in Bucharest, the [[Druskininkai#Culture|Druskininkai Poetic Fall]] festival in Lithuania and the [[Halldór Laxness]] Museum in Iceland.&lt;ref name="Kindred partner"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kindredspirits.eu/partner-pages/ |title=Partners |website=Kindred Spirits |access-date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network became a vehicle for an application for a [[European Union]] Large Cooperation Grant in the autumn of that year. The Foundation was all set to resubmit its application in 2016, with every chance of success, when the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016 |referendum result]] in favour of  [[Brexit]] intervened. As a result, the charity's trustees decided that it was no longer sensible to place EU funding at the centre of the organisation’s future strategy. The Foundation, nevertheless, is keen to build on the relationships it had established with its "poetry house" partners, and particularly on the experience of the conference held in [[Bucharest]] in May 2015, bringing together representatives from all of the partner organisations.&lt;ref name="House"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kindredspirits.eu/news/poetry-house/ |title=The Poetry House |author= [[Graham Henderson (cultural entrepreneur)|Henderson, Graham]] |date=May 2015 |website=Kindred Spirits|accessdate = 3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Poetry House Live theatre show in 2017 was commissioned expressly with the purpose of involving talented up-and-coming playwrights from all of the seven countries involved in the network.

'''''Saint John the Evangelist''''' is a painting by the Italian Baroque painter [[Domenico Zampieri|Domenichino]].  In February 2014 it was on display in the [[National Gallery, London]], on loan from a private collection. 

==History==
The painting is thought to have been commissioned by either [[Benedetto Giustiniani|Benedetto]] (1554–1621) or his brother [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]] (1564–1637) since it appears in the 1638 [[Giustiniani]] inventory. Paintings of Saints [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]], [[Saint Mark|Mark]] and [[Saint Luke|Luke]] (by [[Nicolas Régnier]], [[Francesco Albani]] and [[Guido Reni]] respectively) are also included, all stated to be the same size as the Saint John. It has been suggested therefore that the four paintings were originally intended as a series.&lt;ref name="christies"/&gt;

Despite the prestigious commission, the date of the painting's execution remains unclear. Richard E. Spear, author of numerous publications on [[Seicento|17th-century Italian painting]] and one of the foremost scholars on the life and work of Domenichino,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/faculty/rspear/spear.html|title=Richard E. Spear|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; put the work at around 1627 to 1629. This is due to stylistic similarities with works such as the Sant'Andrea della Valle's ''Saint John''. An alternative theory, put forward in Squarzina's analysis of the 1938 Giustiniani inventory, speculates that the work could be from before 1621. Others have concluded dates between 1624 and 1628.

The painting descended via Vincenzo Giustiniani's heir to Prince Benedetto Giustiniani, in whose posthumous inventory of 1793 it appears, then to Andrea Giustiniani, who in 1804 declined a purchase offer of 6,500 [[scudo (Italian coin)|scudi]] for it. Andrea then had it taken to Paris, probably before 1806, where he sold it to [[Alexis Delahante]]. Delahante and W. Harris then sold it to Richard Hart Davis and it was then sold in around 1813 with the rest of Davis's collection to Philip John Miles. Inherited firstly by his son, [[Sir William Miles, 1st Baronet|William Miles]] then his grandson [[Sir Philip John William Miles, 2nd Baronet|Philip Miles]], the picture was kept at [[Leigh Court]] where it, along with others in the family's extensive collection, could be viewed upon application.   The impact of the [[Long Depression]] and an agricultural crisis depressing farm prices due to cheap imports from abroad, however, simultaneously attacked this landowning and banking family's sources of income and caused Sir Philip to seek to sell in 1884 at [[Christie's]] where part of the collection was among the first to be sold under the terms of Gladstone's [[Settled Lands Act]].   However, Domenichino and his contemporaries had by then gone out of fashion with British buyers and the ''Saint John the Evangelist'' remained unsold. 

It was then auctioned at Christie's again in 1899 on the death of Cecil Miles, 3rd Baronet who was Philip John Miles's great-grandson – this time it was bought in at 100 guineas and subsequently sold for 70 guineas to M. Colnaghi, acting as agent for Augustus Langham Christie of Tapeley Park, Devonshire and Glyndebourne, East Sussex, part of the Christie family. The painting passed down through that family (later headed by [[John Christie (opera manager)|John Christie]] and known for their connection to the [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera]]) for more than a century until it was auctioned in London in December 2009 to an American buyer for £9.2 million. However, it was then the object of an [[export bar]] to keep it in the [[United Kingdom]] due to its history of ownership in the country. British galleries were unable to raise enough money to buy it (the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] and [[National Galleries of Scotland]] already being committed to an expensive deal to buy ''[[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|Diana and Actaeon]]'' and ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'', both by [[Titian]]), but another anonymous collector was allowed to acquire it on the condition that it be displayed to the public for three months each year. He then loaned it to the National Gallery in London from May 2010 to August 2011, where it had previously been displayed from 1992 to 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120917155603/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23741650-details/Glyndebourne+family+to+sell+Old+Master+for+10+million/article.do Glyndebourne family to sell Old Master for £10 million], ''London Evening Standard'', 9 Sept 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/may/18/saved-painting-domenichino-national-gallery 'Saved' Domenichino painting loaned to National Gallery], Guardian, 18 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment_and_arts/10119883.stm|title=Baroque painting by master Domenichino saved for nation|work=BBC News|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/private-collectors-16392m-saves-masterpiece-from-export-1975587.html|title=Private collector's &amp;#163;9.2m saves masterpiece from export - News - Art - The Independent|work=The Independent|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=33182|title=Domenichino Masterpiece to Be Offered at Christie's Auction of Old Masters and 19th Century Art|author=Ignacio Villarreal|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[John the Evangelist|Saint John the Evangelist]] is depicted as a young man accompanied by his traditional symbol the eagle and two [[putti]]. His gaze is directed upwards towards God as he receives the inspiration for his [[gospel]], emphasised by the strong [[chiaroscuro]] light bearing down upon him. This was typical of the artist's style, continuing in the manner of late [[Raphael]] and his own master [[Annibale Carracci]].

The composition is said to have been inspired by classical sculpture, with some commentators pointing specifically to [[Laocoön and His Sons|The Laocoon]].&lt;ref name="christies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5277781&amp;sid=c6f04220-8a30-494e-be4f-fc7874d4c049|title=Domenico Zampieri, Il Domenichino (Bologna 1581-1641 Naples)|author=Christie?s|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also evident in Domenichino's other large-scale treatments of the subject such as Madonna and Child with the Saints John the Evangelist and Petronius and the pendentive in the church of  [[Sant'Andrea della Valle]]. The painting also includes an example of the artist's landscape painting, an aspect of his work that was particularly influential on the likes of [[Claude Lorrain]] and [[Nicolas Poussin]]. This element of the work was originally more compressed into the right-hand section of the canvas, the architecture taking precedence. However,  Domenichino reconsidered this layout and over painted an extension of the landscape onto the wall. Other alterations are also visible in the books, the hand of the right putto and the larger hill of the landscape.

[[Philip Glass]]' '''second symphony''' was commissioned by [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]]. It was first performed on October 15, 1994, by the [[Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra]], conducted by [[Dennis Russell Davies]].

==Scoring and structure==
The work is scored for [[piccolo]], two [[flute]]s, two [[oboe]]s doubling [[English horn]], [[E-flat clarinet]], two [[clarinet|B-flat clarinets]], [[bass clarinet|bass/contrabass clarinet]], two [[bassoon]]s, four [[french horn|horns]], three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], four percussionists, piano, harp, and strings.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;[http://www.chesternovello.com/Default.aspx?TabId=2432&amp;State_3041=2&amp;workId_3041=6353# Philip Glass: Symphony No. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; It has three continuous movements with contrasting themes and lasts approximately 40 minutes.

Glass commented on his use of polyphony in the work that "The great experiments of polytonality carried out in the 1930s and 40s show that there's still a lot of work to be done in that area. Harmonic language and melodic language can coexist closely or at some calculated distance, and their relationship can be worked out in terms of either coexisting harmonies or ambiguous harmonies...I'm more interested in the ambiguous qualities that can result from polytonality — how what you hear depends on how you focus your ear, how a listener's perception of tonality can vary in the fashion of an optical illusion. We're not talking about inventing a new language, but rather inventing new perceptions of existing languages."&lt;ref&gt;Programme notes to the 1998 recording on [http://www.philipglass.com/music/recordings/symphony_2.php  Nonesuch Records]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Symphony No. 4''', in E minor is an orchestral composition by the Romanian composer [[George Enescu]], left incomplete at the composer's death, but finished in 1996 by [[Pascal Bentoiu]].
	
==History==
Enescu began sketching his Fourth Symphony in 1928, but did not return to it in earnest until after completing the orchestration of his opera ''[[Œdipe (opera)|Œdipe]]'' in 1931. Although he worked on the symphony from 1932, he broke off work in December 1934 after achieving a complete draft and a partial orchestration. He briefly resumed work in the spring of 1939, but it remained incomplete at his death ({{harvnb|Bentoiu|2010|loc=522}}; {{harvnb|Malcolm|1990|loc=189, 206}}).

Enescu made two orchestrated drafts of the first movement. The first is undated, while the second one, dated 20 October {{harv|Zottoviceanu, Rațiu, and Marbe|1971|loc=712, 751}} (or possibly 20 December according to {{harvnb|Malcolm|1990|loc=206, 275}}) 1934, also continues the orchestration into the second movement, extending through about the first quarter of it. After having completed Enescu's [[Symphony No. 5 (Enescu)|Fifth Symphony]] in 1995, Pascal Bentoiu undertook completion of the Fourth as well, and this version was premiered in Bucharest on 2 October 1997 by {{ill|Cristian Mandeal|ro}} conducting the [[George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra]] {{harv|Bentoiu|2010|loc=524–25}}. The UK premiere was given in London on 29 April 2017 by Samuel Draper conducting the Oberon Symphony Orchestra {{harv|Clarke|2017}}.

==Analysis==
The symphony has three [[movement (music)|movements]], which are played without pauses in between:
*Allegro apassionato
*Un poco andante, marziale
*Allegro vivace – non troppo
The first movement is in [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro form]], with the exposition presenting the exceptionally economical matter (only five or six melodic elements) that will account for virtually all of the music in the symphony. The main [[Cyclic form|cyclic]] theme, which will recur in each movement at the same pitch and in the same instrument, first appears in the trumpet at rehearsal number 21. The [[Development (music)|development]] section is comparatively short, but this will be compensated by further extensive development in the finale. The [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] brings back the two main themes in reverse order. The second theme, originally presented in the solo flute, returns in a blaze of orchestral colour, while the first theme group is represented mainly by what was originally a [[Bridge (music)#Classical music|bridge]] idea {{harv|Bentoiu|2010|loc=525–27}}. This first movement, although completed by Enescu, cannot be regarded on its own, nor did the composer conceive it as such. Even in its unfinished form, the second movement (Un poco andante, marziale) follows without interruption and represents, in its thematic character, a continuation of the initial movement {{harv|Zottoviceanu, Rațiu, and Marbe|1971|loc=751}}.

The second movement develops further both of the theme groups from the first movement, in a march character that builds steadily to a climax at rehearsal number 49 and then subsides to a whisper in a solo string quartet, specified by the composer in the short-score sketch. The movement ends inconclusively, with a tremolo in the strings, cymbals, and harp that leads directly into the finale {{harv|Bentoiu|2010|loc=527–28}}.

The finale is difficult to assign to a definite form. Although there are passages with expository and developmental aspects, its overall function is the recapitulation of all the material from the previous two movements. After a certain point, Enescu turns his attention to breaking up the rhythms within the {{Music|time|3|4}} metre, first into twos, then fours, fives, nines, and tens, as well as superimposing them until finally the underlying ternary rhythm is broken and transformed into a binary metre {{harv|Bentoiu|2010|loc=529}}.

'''''The Legend of Neil''''' is a [[comedy]] [[web series]] distributed by [[Comedy Central]]'s partner [[Atom.com]]&lt;ref name=fb&gt;{{cite web |author= |title=Atom.com Launches Second Season of Hit Web Series 'Legend Of Neil' |publisher=[[Fox Business]] |date=27 July 2009 |url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/industries/media/atomcom-launches-second-season-hit-web-series-legend-neil/ |accessdate=27 September 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a [[parody]] of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo game]] ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]''. [[Sandeep Parikh]] of ''[[The Guild (web series)|The Guild]]'' fame directs the series. Tony Janning writes for the series, and acts as the title character Neil. [[Felicia Day]] and Mike Rose, who have worked with Parikh on the set of ''The Guild'', appear as recurring characters.

The series follows Neil, who is sucked into the world of ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' while playing the game. As he travels [[Hyrule]] he is mistaken for the hero of the game, [[Link (Legend of Zelda)|Link]]. The series is "full of self degrading, foul humor",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Woerner, Meredith |title=Flashing Fairies And Moblins: The Legend Of Neil Is Back |publisher=[[io9]] |date=16 July 2009 |url=http://io9.com/5316373/flashing-fairies-and-moblins-the-legend-of-neil-is-back |accessdate=27 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as when Neil is being sucked into the game he is [[Masturbation|masturbating]] and [[autoerotic asphyxiation|strangled]] himself with his [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] controller.

The series began as a four-minute YouTube video posted in 2007. The video went viral, receiving several million views. Its popularity led to Atom.com financing a web series based around the video.

The first season was released in 2008. According to Fox Business before the premiere of the second season, "With nearly one million plays, the hit Web series by creator Sandeep Parikh built one of the Web's most enthusiastic fan bases in 2008."&lt;ref name=fb /&gt; In the run-up to the August 2009 premiere of the second season, [[MTV2]] planned to air the complete first season.&lt;ref name=fb /&gt; The series was also nominated for multiple [[Streamys]] at the [[1st Streamy Awards]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://streamys.org/nominees.shtml 2009 Nominees – The Streamy Awards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805055033/http://streamys.org/nominees.shtml |date=2009-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Season 3 began on July 25, 2010. Each episode of season 3 features a remix of the original theme song performed by a different musical guest.

A DVD was released on December 4, 2012.

==Characters and cast==
*'''Neil ([[Link (Legend of Zelda)|Link]])''' – after getting fired from a gas station by his brother, a drunken Neil was transported into the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo]] game ''The Legend of Zelda''. He then unwillingly plays the role of the game's main character, a forest elf named '''Link'''. Neil as Link contrasts with many of the characters' views of Link, while Link is honest and brave, Neil is lazy and will use any tricks he can find to get out of the game. He is so much the opposite of Link that he tends to befriend the monsters whose sole purpose is to kill him. Neil is portrayed by co-writer of the series, Tony Janning.
*'''[[Recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#Old Man|Old Man]]''' – Link's in-game mentor, loosely based on the old man in the first Zelda video game who gives the player a wooden sword before the first level. Old Man is portrayed by Mike Rose. Old Man has a twin brother O-old Man (pronounced with a change in emphasis) who is left-handed, a better potion maker, and has [[Tourette syndrome]]. Usually only one of the twins speaks to Link, but on occasion—such as in Season 2, Episode 3—they appear simultaneously. Both of the Old Men are generally helpful to Neil, often in a sarcastic or condescending manner.
*'''[[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Fairy|Fairy]]''' – a fairy who replenishes Link's health. In the series she does so by having sex with Link, and she becomes emotionally and sexually obsessed with him. Fairy also seems to be emotionally unstable, often taking Neil's compliments as insults and vice versa. In the series, the fairies are hunted for their dust, which is used as a [[Insufflation (medicine)|drug]], a fate which befalls Fairy in Season 2, Episode 1. In the first episode of the third season it is revealed that the fairy is pregnant. Fairy is portrayed by [[Felicia Day]] of ''[[Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog|Dr. Horrible]]'' and ''[[The Guild (web series)|The Guild]]'' fame.
*'''[[Princess Zelda]]''' – the title character from the video game. Zelda's parents were killed by Ganon and she herself was captured and imprisoned. She appears to Neil in visions, alternately pleading and enticing him to continue to rescue her. Neil was initially surprised by her ethnic appearance, expecting a lighter-skinned princess from the video game graphics (In "The Legend of Neil" she's black). Zelda is portrayed by [[Angie Hill]]. ''Dr. Horrible'' co-creator [[Maurissa Tancharoen|Maurissa Tancharoen Whedon]] provides Zelda's singing voice in the musical episode.&lt;ref name=musical1&gt;{{cite web |author=Hustvedt, Marc |title='Legend of Neil' Season 2 Boasts Musical Romp |publisher=[[Tubefilter News]] |date=22 July 2009 |url=http://news.tubefilter.tv/2009/07/22/legend-of-neil-season-2-boasts-musical-romp/ |accessdate=27 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=musical2&gt;{{cite web |author=Hustvedt, Marc |title='Legend of Neil' Raunchy Musical Episode Debuts |publisher=[[Tubefilter News]] |date=24 August 2009 |url=http://news.tubefilter.tv/2009/08/24/legend-of-neil-raunchy-musical-episode-debuts/ |accessdate=27 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Ganon]]''' – the leading antagonist of the game and series. Ganon is played as an incompetent authority figure, impervious to the suggestions of his advisor Wizzrobe. Ganon never seems to leave his shadowed throne until the end of season two. He seems to enjoy singing and is a patron of stand-up comedy. Ganon's ineptitude extends to his attempts to woo Princess Zelda at a "romantic" dinner. In the Season 2 finale he reveals to Zelda that his parents are trapped in some "vortex". It is implied that Ganon is a Moblin. When his face is finally shown, there are similarities, and he comments that he possesses three penises, a trait previously attributed to the Moblins. Ganon is portrayed by Scott Chernoff.
*'''[[Recurring enemies in The Legend of Zelda series#Wizzrobe|Wizzrobe]]''' – Ganon's sidekick. He first appears after Neil has met Fairy and steals Neil's clothing to lure him to the Level 1 dungeon. He frequently observes logical inconsistencies within the game that are recognizable to fans, such as the maps and keys that are left in the dungeon for Link to find. Whenever he suggests changing the policy to Ganon, he is abused for his presumption, forcing him into the role of a fawning toady. Wizzrobe applies Ganon's [[Cosmetics|makeup]] before his 'big date' with the captive Princess Zelda, prompting Ganon to insinuate that Wizzrobe is infatuated with him, prompting unconvincing denial. Wizzrobe is actually gay and is seen in the finale smooching with the Male Fairy. Wizzrobe is portrayed by Eric Acosta.
*'''[[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Creatures|Dark Nut]]''' – A powerful dark knight (nonsensically renamed by Ganon to conform to ''The Legend of Zelda'' terminology) introduced by Wizzrobe as an invincible opponent to Neil. The other Dark Nuts are seemingly unfazed by Neil's sword blasts, and the Dark Nut was able to knock him unconscious with a single blow. But in the second episode of the third season it is revealed that, due to budget cuts, the Dark Nuts' armor doesn't cover their butts. This is their only weakness and eventually they are killed by Neil. Darknut has a brother who appears in "The Gloffice" and is seen crying over his dead brothers as Wizzrobe comforts him. In the finale, this Dark Nut is (like Wizzrobe) gay and is seen making out with a Stalfos. Dark Nut is portrayed by Jeff Winkler.
*'''[[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Creatures|Octorok]]''' – In Season 1, Neil is often plagued by the Octorok creatures. In the show they are depicted as thin men wearing loin cloths and red masks. They announce their presence with an odd ululation, and throw rocks at Neil. They occasionally speak to Neil, usually to threaten him in their scary voice, try to trick him in their squeaky voice, or to plead in their normal voice when one of them is killed by Neil, but generally stick to the ululation. In Season 2 "A Link to the Past" he kills three of them. In "Gettin' High in Hyrule", one of them is used as a dartboard and feels no pain. And in "The Gloffice", one of them works there.
*'''[[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Creatures|Moblin]]''' – Moblins are strong creatures with three penises who seem to want nothing but to destroy and sodomize Link. The most notable Moblins are [[Dwight Schrute|Blight]] of Ganon's "[[The Office|The Gloffice]]" and the secret moblin, Pippi who helps Link even against his "primal" urges. Moblins are depicted as [[humanoid]] because of the low budget of the series. The Moblins (except Pippi) attack Neil but with some help from the bow, sex with Fairy and sword beams, he kills them all.
*'''[[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Creatures|Stalfos]]''' – Three Stalfos made only two appearances—in "The Skeletons in Link's Closet" and "Restart of the King". They are portrayed as gay [[skeleton]]s with German accents that mock Neil into killing them. They tease Neil by insulting him and making up some stupid deals causing him to stab two of them and laser the last one. The first one has a key in its ribs and a bandana, the second one has a belt, and the third one has a mustache. One of them is seen in the finale, making out with a Dark Nut.
*'''[[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Creatures|Keese]]''' – Keeses appear in "The Skeletons in Link's Closet", "A Date with Destiny" and "The Gloffice". They look like models on strings because of the low budget of the series. After Neil puts on the Hero's Clothes, a bat takes a dump on him and they attack him by swarming around him like [[bee]]s. After Neil escapes and kills the Stalfos, the Keeses attack him again. In Season 1 "Map Questing", the Keeses are revealed by Wizzrobe telling Ganon that Neil has killed all the Keeses. Neil kills them in Season 2 in "A Date with Destiny" and one Keese appears in "The Gloffice" talking to Ganon in the introduction.
*'''[[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Creatures|Goriya]]''' – Three Goriyas make their one appearance in Season 1 in "Map Questing". They are portrayed as goblins with Australian accents, carrying boomerangs. They say to Neil that they're powerful and they've got boomerangs. Neil zaps the three Goriyas with his sword beams. One Goriya appears in a picture in Season 2 "Gettin' High in Hyrule" that says, "Missing. Last seen playing with boomerangs."
*'''[[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Creatures|Gibdo]]''' – Gibdos appear in three episodes: "Les Neilérables", in which Neil sings after killing them; "A Date with Destiny", in which Neil kills them while they make out and give birth to a baby Gibdo, which Neil kicks away; and "The Gloffice", in which one of them works there.

Gannon and Wizrobe are astonished at Neil's accomplishment, but are sure that the next level will destroy him. Neil meets the Old Men, who make fun of him and give him a potion. Zelda, imprisoned, sings of her faith in Neil, while Neil, defeating [[Recurring enemies in The Legend of Zelda series#Gibdo|mummies]], tries to get drunk on potion and wishes he were home. Neil defeats a four-headed plant that is shipped to Gannon, stimulating further consternation in his council. After a grand finale, Wizrobe whispers a new plan to Gannon and Neil discovers a Pub.

|colspan="6" bgcolor="FFFFFF"| Neil, disregarding Old Man's warnings, sneaks into the Pub. He finds a bulletin board with wanted posters for Link, the mass murderer of Hyrule. Disguising himself with a Moblin helmet, he joins the Moblins in the Pub, whose main conversational topic is ways of torturing and killing Link. After a long drunken carouse, Neil's helmet falls off and he is recognized as Link.  He pleads with the Moblins, who are the only friends he has found in Hyrule, but they still want to kill him. Neil runs away and is captured by the Secret Moblin, who misdirects the pursuers.

|colspan="6" bgcolor="FFFFFF"| Neil wakes up in the cave of the Secret Moblin named Pippi, who has fully replenished Neil's heart meter. The Secret Moblin describes his elfin studies, and his need to suppress his base instincts of sodomizing and killing elves. He teaches Neil how to use his "inventory" by holding his items above his head, and he tells Neil of a magic whistle in Level 5 that can send Neil anywhere he wishes. The Secret Moblin begins to lose control of his base instincts and Neil leaves the cave as the Secret Moblin attempts to suppress three simultaneous erections. Neil travels through the desert to find the waterfall that hides the White Sword. However, upon spying the waterfall, he is shot by an arrow in the left arm by the Moblins from the pub.

Gannon reveals Neil tied up and beaten by Dark Nut. Neil reveals that he does not love Princess Zelda and would not die for her. Gannon then stabs Neil through the stomach with the White Sword. Neil awakens in his apartment where he was playing the Legend of Zelda, and notices the heart meter still on his wrist.  The game provides him the option to continue or quit.

|colspan="7" bgcolor="FFFFFF"| Series Finale. Neil falls through Spectacle Rock and into Level 9. After fighting through the level and finding Ganon, Neil tries his best to use his weapons against Ganon but he just destroys them and turns invisible. After a few fireball hits, Neil is near death before Old Man returns to battle Ganon. While Old Man distracts Ganon, the Fairy reconciles with Neil and restores him to full health. Ganon kills Old Man, but a fully healed Neil reengages the battle and goads Ganon into fighting hand to hand. Neil gains the upper hand and is about to defeat Ganon when Ganon cheats and begins using fireballs. When Neil is once again almost dead and Ganon holds him from behind, the Fairy attempts to heal him once more, but Wizzrobe intervenes and grabs the Fairy. Neil convinces Wizzrobe to switch sides, and Wizzrobe throws Neil an arrow dipped in silver (also Ganon hits Wizzrobe with a fireball), with which Neil stabs himself with it and it stabs Ganon from behind. Wizzrobe survives the attack but Fairy doesn't. After promising to Fairy about not having sex with anybody (not even himself), Neil retrieves the Triforce of Power from Ganon's remains and frees Princess Zelda. They marry and Neil becomes king. It is then revealed that Wizzrobe is now working for Neil, although he often misses Ganon. Link has integrated the schools to which he sends his fairy children Oold Man's ghost gets laid and Wizrobe is thankful for the new king legalizing gay marriage.

Later, while sitting on the toilet, Neil is sucked through the pipes and comes out dressed as Mario. He encounters his brother, dressed as Luigi, and the two discuss their surroundings. Realizing where he is, Neil and his brother say "Oh, fu-" but they are cut off by a Fade to Black. In a post-credits scene, the title "Super Grimsley Bros." appears while Neil's brother, Darrel, tells him about jumping, smashing blocks, and the Super Star ("pure, uncut cocaine for 15 seconds" as he calls it). While Darrel is rapidly searching on Neil for a Super Star, Wizzrobe, back at the castle, stands on a balcony and is shown a locket with a picture of Ganon, saying "You were just too ugly for this world, my Lord." Just then, a ghostly image of Ganon's hand appears, smacks Wizzrobe in the face, says, "I know Wizzrobe. I miss me too." and Wizzrobes smiles while holding his staff.

'''''The Ninth Wave''''' ({{lang-ru|Девятый вал}}, ''Dyevyatiy val'') is an [[1850 in art|1850]] painting by the Russian Armenian [[marine art|marine painter]] [[Ivan Aivazovsky]]. It is his best-known work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ninth Wave|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_9_0_32_1.html|publisher=[[Hermitage Museum]]|accessdate=1 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104185704/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_9_0_32_1.html|archivedate=4 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aivazovsky, I. K. The Ninth Wave. 1850|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~mitrege/russian/art/target.php?file=00166|publisher=[[Auburn University]]|accessdate=10 December 2013|quote=Detail from "The Ninth Wave" "The Ninth Wave," painted in 1850, is Aivazovsky's most famous work and is an archetypal image for the artist.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title refers to an old sailing expression referring to a wave of incredible size that comes after a succession of incrementally larger waves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://framing.indiana.edu/2015/01/05/debating-globalization-ninth-wave/ Debating Globalization and the Ninth Wave] at University of Indiana Framing the Global Program Debate&lt;/ref&gt;

It depicts a sea after a night storm and people facing death attempting to save themselves by clinging to debris from a wrecked ship. The debris, in the shape of the cross,  appears to be a Christian metaphor for  salvation from the earthly sin. The painting has warm tones, which reduce the sea's apparent menacing overtones and a chance for the people to survive seems plausible. This painting shows the destructive side, and beauty of nature.

==Synopsis==
The documentary miniseries follows "award-winning architect Piers Taylor and actress and property enthusiast Caroline Quentin explore a range of incredible architect-designed houses in extreme locations around the world. Whether built into the side of a cliff, nestled in a forest, perched at the top of a mountain or hidden under the earth, these homes connect to their environments in a spectacular way. Each episode is themed according to the houses environments — Coast, Forest, Mountain and Underground — with Piers and Caroline traveling to locations ranging from North America to Australasia and Europe. To explore how these dramatic designs function both as works of architecture and as real houses, they stay overnight, eat meals and spend time in the homes."&lt;ref name="flixable"&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Most Extraordinary Homes (2017) - Netflix {{!}} Flixable|url=https://flixable.com/title/80213025/|website=flixable.com|accessdate=13 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WBITVP Finished Catalogue 2017|url=https://wbproductions.box.com/shared/static/skntuwfpldn045wc41hxwlzqnwvddgla.pdf|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Votive relief of Jupiter Dolichenus''' was discovered in the ancient city of [[Perrhe]] in the kingdom of [[Commagene]] in the southeast of modern [[Turkey]]. It is now displayed in the [[Adıyaman Archaeological Museum]].

== Discovery ==
The [[votive]] relief was discovered in the vast [[necropolis]] of the city of Perrhe - today the suburb of Pirin in the provincial capital of [[Adiyaman]]. During excavation and cleaning work by the Museum of Adiyaman in 2001 under the leadership of its Director, Fehmi Erarslan, the relief was revealed in secondary use as the covering for a late antique grave. Along with [[Samosata]], [[Kahramanmaraş|Marasch]] and [[Dülük|Doliche]], Perrhe was one of the core cities of the Kingdom of Commagene. Thus, the relief of [[Jupiter Dolichenus]] is the only one thus far known, which has been found in the immiediate area of the god's original worship. While images of him spread throughout the whole [[Roman empire]] and numerous examples have been found in Western Europe, they are rare in Asia Minor and Syria. As part of a project of the Forstellungstelle Asia Minor of the [[University of Münster]], the relief was discussed  by Michael Blömer (relief) and Margherita Facella (inscription).

== Depiction ==
The [[stele]] is made of light yellow local [[limestone]] and measures 0.81 m high and 0.63 m wide. The base is 11 cm deep, the greatest projection of the relief is 12 cm. At left is the god and at right, under his arm is an eight-line inscription. A large part of the relief is lost, including the point of the god's hat and both hands, while of the legs only the upper thighs survive. This bottom break runs through the final line of the inscription. The relief is very deep, such that parts of the figure like the head and the arms are nearly in the round. The god is shown in a typical pose of Jupiter Dolichenus, with his right arm raised and his left arm bent. There was a thunderbolt held in his left hand, but only the lower part still survives. The [[labrys]] usually found in the right hand is completely lost. Jupiter is depicted with a beard and long hair, both of which are depicted in detail with individual spiral locks. Despite the serious damage to the face, the deep-set eyes with drilled pupils can still be made out. On top of his head, he wears a [[Phrygian cap]]. Otherwise he is dressed in a military outfit. On his upper body, he wears a Roman [[muscle cuirass]] over his tunic, which is held in place by flat leather straps over his shoulders and a [[Cingulum militare]] around his midriff. Over his hips he wears the [[Pteruges]], with deep furrows in between them. Over his cuirass the god wears a [[paludamentum]], which is gathered over his right shoulder and hangs down from his left shoulder such that it is visible in the background behind him. A small [[bandolier]] holds a sword on his right hand side. The god wears tights on his legs. Above the right shoulder of the figure, behind the raised arm, the remains of an eagle are visible. The end of the left wing and the tail feathers are relatively clear.

The relief may have been complete with the common, right-facing bull, on which the god would have stood, as is common in the iconography of images of Jupiter Dolichenus. The tights the god wears are remarkable, as is the head covering. Both were considered "oriental" attributes by the Romans and thus emphasised his supposed birthplace. In other images from northern Syria and Asia Minor, there are no other cases of the god depicted wearing tights, although they were subsequently an attribute of the god, especially in Roman depictions.

== Inscription ==
The dedicatory inscription is in the right, lower floor of the field, between the left leg and the left arm. It is eight lines long, with letters deeply carved into the stone. The letters get smaller lower down, which indicates that the stonemason had issues fitting the text in the available space. The inscription says:
:Γάϊος ᾿Ιούλιος Παῦλος τὸν θὲον Δολίχεος στρατιώτης ἀνέθηκεν χ[ρ]ηματισθείς
:''Gaius Iulius Paulus, soldier, dedicated [this] to the god of Doliche, after receiving an oracular response.''

Thus the inscription supplies the name of the dedicant, his position, and the reason for his dedication. The donor from Doliche was a soldier and his name indicates that he was a [[Roman citizen]]. Blömer and Facella suggest that one of his ancestors received citizenship and adopted the [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]] Julius. This ''nomen'' was widespread in North Syria and Commagene and indicates either the emperor who was reigning at the time of the receipt of citizenship or the governor of the province who was responsible for the award.

It is not stated which legion of the army that Gaius Julius Paulus belonged to. It is known that towards the end of the 2nd century AD, soldiers of the [[Legio IV Scythica]] were carrying out construction work in Commagene and that, around the same time, the [[Legio XVI Flavia Firma]] was tasked with the construction of the [[Severan Bridge|Chabinas bridge]]. But whether Paulus came to Perrhe as a member of one of these legiones or belonged to another ''[[vexillatio]]'' stationed in the area, cannot be determined. This is particularly the case because the original location of the stele is unclear. 

The letterforms indicate that the inscription dates to the period between the late 2nd century AD and the beginning of the 3rd century AD.
