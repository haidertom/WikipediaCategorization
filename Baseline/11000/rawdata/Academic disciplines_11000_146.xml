'''Arts administration''' (alternatively '''arts management''') is the field that concerns [[business operations]] around an [[arts]] organization.  Arts administrators are responsible for facilitating the day-to-day operations of the [[organization]] and fulfilling its mission. Arts organizations include professional non-profit entities (e.g. theaters, museums, symphonies, jazz organizations, opera houses, and ballet companies) and many smaller professional and non-professional for-profit arts-related organizations (e.g. auction houses, art galleries, music companies, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Byrnes, William, J, (2009). "Management and the Arts". Focal Press. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The duties of an arts administrator can include [[staff management]], marketing, budget management, public relations, fundraising, program development and evaluation, and board relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/artsadministrator.aspx|title = Job profiles: Arts administrator|date = |accessdate = April 5, 2015|website = National Careers Service|publisher = Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, UK|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/careers/management-arts-administrators|title = Career: Arts Administrators|date = |accessdate = April 5, 2015|website = Big Future|publisher = College Board|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts administrators==
Art administrators (alternatively '''arts managers''') work for arts and cultural organizations such as theatres, symphonies, "...art [[Art museum|galleries]], [[museums]], arts festivals, arts centers, arts councils, regional arts boards, [[dance]] companies, community arts organizations, disability arts organizations, and local authorities."&lt;ref name="prospects.ac.uk"&gt;[http://www.prospects.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/Explore_types_of_jobs/Types_of_Job/p!eipaL?state=showocc&amp;idno=61&amp;pageno=1 Arts administrator: Job description and activities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

An arts administrator in a small organization may do [[marketing]], event booking, and handle financial issues. An arts administrator for a larger arts organization may be responsible for buildings and facilities, creative staff (e.g., performers/artists), other administrative staff, [[public relations]], marketing, and writing reports.

A senior-level arts administrator may advise the [[board of directors]] or other senior managers on "strategic planning and management decisions. An effective arts administrator must also be knowledgeable in local, state and federal [[public policy]] as it relates to [[human resources]], [[health insurance]], [[labor laws]] and volunteer risk management."&lt;ref name="prospects.ac.uk"/&gt;

There are several notable professionals in the field. [[Philippe de Montebello]] was curator of New York City's [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] from 1977-2008. On his retirement, he was both the longest-serving director in the institution's history and the longest-serving director of any major art museum in the world. [[Michael Maddox]] co-founded the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] in Moscow, home to [[Bolshoi Ballet]] and [[Bolshoi Opera]], which are amongst the oldest and grandest ballet and opera companies in the world.  Another notable figure in arts administration is John Lane of John Lane's Ogunquit Playhouse in Ogunquit, Maine.  Lane acquired the playhouse in 1950 and successfully ran the organization, still considered to be "America's foremost summer theatre," until his retirement in 1994.

==Issues in arts administration==
Like any business, arts organizations must work within changing external and internal environments.&lt;ref&gt;^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). "Management and the Arts". Focal Press. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; External changes may be cultural, social, demographic, economic, political, legal, or technological.  Internal changes may be related to the audience, membership, Board of Directors, personnel, facilities, growth, or financial operations. Another change that must be taken into consideration is the growing need for technology-based marketing programs (i.e.: social media) in order for the organization to change with the times and bring younger visitor and member pools into the organization.

Although a good arts administrator constantly monitors and manages change, they must also remain aware of the overall direction and mood of the organization while helping people do their day-to-day jobs.&lt;ref&gt;^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). "Management and the Arts". Focal Press. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Arts organizations, as part of the economic system, experience the effects of expansion and contractions in the local, regional, national, and world economies.&lt;ref&gt;^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). "Management and the Arts". Focal Press. p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Many arts organizations struggle in difficult economic times.

==Academic programs==
Arts administration programs are available at a number of universities and colleges in the US, the UK, Canada and Australia.&lt;!-- No others? --&gt;   In the United States, these programs began in the 1970s at several schools after meetings with the National Endowment for the Arts on how the next generations of arts leaders would be educated.  Some academic units offer certificate programs for practitioners seeking continuing education or professional development education. While programs in arts administration draw on many elements of related administration fields, such as [[business administration]], they also include specialized courses on administering [[non-profit]] arts and cultural organizations.

Arts administration programs award a range of credentials, including certificates and diplomas, bachelor's degrees, and master's degrees. These programs usually blend curriculum elements from existing administration programs such as [[public administration]], business administration, arts law, and [[management]]. At some institutions arts administration may be a concentration within the school's [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program. The MA in Arts Administration program at [[Columbia University]] is the only program that ties together curriculum elements from public and private management/administration, law, business, and finance at an [[Ivy league]] university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arts Administration@Teachers College, Columbia University|url=http://www.tc.columbia.edu/artsadmin/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many arts administration programs include a practicum in which the student volunteers or works in an arts or cultural organization to gain practical experience.

At some universities, similar programs are called arts management (e.g. American University)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Arts Management Degree Programs &amp; Information {{!}} American University, Washington, DC|url = http://www.american.edu/cas/arts-management/|website = www.american.edu|accessdate = 2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, performing arts management (e.g. DePaul University's Undergraduate music program)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Performing Arts Management {{!}} School of Music {{!}} DePaul University|url = https://music.depaul.edu/academics/undergraduate-majors/performing-arts-management-bm/Pages/default.aspx|website = www.depaul.edu|accessdate = 2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or arts leadership (e.g. DePaul University's Graduate program).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Graduate Degree in Arts Leadership {{!}} Conservatory {{!}} DePaul Theatre {{!}} DePaul University|url = http://theatre.depaul.edu/conservatory/graduate/arts-leadership/Pages/default.aspx|website = theatre.depaul.edu|accessdate = 2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Universities such as American, Wisconsin and Indiana, among many others, offer programs to students in all arts disciplines, while others are more specialized towards a particular discipline (DePaul's undergraduate and graduate theatre programs are theatre oriented, while it's undergraduate music program is music oriented).  The master's degree at some schools is an [[MBA]], while other universities offer [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]], MA, and MPA degrees, largely depending on where the program is housed.  For example, at American University, the program is part of the Department of Performing Arts, whereas at Indiana University it is part of the School of Public and Environmental Affairs.  Another program differentiator of note is that the MFA is considered a terminal degree in the field, allowing graduates to apply to teach at the university level as a full-time professor.

Though curricula may be similar, the atmosphere of programs may differ.  Variances between programs may often revolve around the centrality of arts versus the centrality of business skills in the curriculum.  Other programs, such as Ohio State, Indiana, and (increasingly) American, are strongly rooted in cultural policy.  Another program differentiator is the amount of time spent "in the field", applying academic principles to existing arts organizations through practicum or internship experiences.  [http://www.seattleu.edu/artsci/mfa/ Seattle University's] [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in Arts Leadership degree program requires that students spend time each quarter working with a local arts organization through a practicum.  They believe this emphasis on real-world interaction helps reinforce classwork and helps build a network of arts professionals that serves as a resource upon graduation. At George Mason University, MA in Arts Management at the College of Visual &amp; Performing Arts (Arlington, VA) [http://artsmanagement.gmu.edu], one of the largest enrolled programs in the USA, no less than 252 hours of internship are required in at least two different arts organizations. At this institution, the faculty are required to be both academically and experientially qualified, with many being current senior arts managers at some of the Washington, DC's area most prominent visual &amp; performing arts centers.

Most programs require two years in residence, though [http://www.drexel.com/online-degrees/business-degrees/arts-administration/index.aspx Drexel University], [http://universitycollege.du.edu/mals/degree/masters/arts-development-and-program-management-online/degreeid/423 University of Denver], and [[Goucher College]] offer online options with limited residency. The [http://finearts.uky.edu/arts-administration/ma-program University of Kentucky] and [[Savannah College of Art and Design]] offer fully online degrees in arts administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Online M.A. Program {{!}} College of Fine Arts|url = http://finearts.uky.edu/arts-administration/ma-program|website = finearts.uky.edu|accessdate = 2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Arts administration|url = https://www.scad.edu/academics/programs/arts-administration|accessdate = 2015-04-06|website = SCAD}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to accommodate full-time employment, provide strong networking opportunities, and many teamwork opportunities, programs such as [http://www.seattleu.edu/artsci/mfa/ Seattle University] have adopted a cohort model and offer classes on evenings and weekends.

Some programs offer dual degrees.  For example, the [[University of Cincinnati]] offers an MA/MBA program in conjunction with the Cincinnati [[College-Conservatory of Music]].  The UC/CCM Graduate Arts Administration Program, like most others, exists to prepare and train students to become successful [[CEO]]s and senior managers of non-profit arts and cultural institutions by combining business administration and real-world experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsadminmba.com www.ArtsAdminMBA.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, the [http://www.ied.edu Istituto Europeo di Design], in Venice, offers a [http://www.ied.edu/venice/management-school/master-courses/business-administration-for-arts-and-cultural-events/CMG2095E Master in Business Administration in Arts and Cultural Events] that provides advanced knowledge and entrepreneurial skills necessary to understand and operate in the multifarious world of the arts. A similar course is held in [[Bologna]], at the [[University of Bologna]], called Innovation and Organization of Culture and the Arts [http://corsi.unibo.it/gioca/Pages/default.aspx], offering a double degree opportunity together with Carnegie Mellon's Master of Arts Management. In Turin, the [[St. John International University]] [http://www.sjiu.it/] offers a Master of Arts in International Arts Administration. A new innovative program based on the concept of artwork as 'information', that integrate recording, cataloging, communication, management, fruition. The program is led by faculty and high level practitioners from Heritage, srl.

Other programs may offer a single degree that includes coursework at two colleges. [[Carnegie Mellon]]'s Master of Arts Management (MAM) Program is one example, tying the [[Carnegie Mellon College of Fine Arts|College of Fine Arts]] to [[Heinz College]]'s School of Public Policy and Management. Heinz College provides the core management coursework and the College of Fine Arts supports the MAM Program with coursework specific to arts institutions.  Another example is the two-year MA/MBA program at [[Southern Methodist University]], offering a Master of Arts in Arts Administration from the Meadows School of the Arts and a Master of Business Administration from the Cox School of Business.

Some programs are housed within their university's Music, Theater and Dance department like the one at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado. This is the [http://leap.colostate.edu/masters/ LEAP Institute for the Arts Master of Arts Leadership and Administration] residential and online programs.

Several universities offer concentrations in media (film, television, music, new media, etc.) management: Drexel University, Carnegie Mellon, and Columbia College Chicago are examples.  Carnegie Mellon offers a separate degree in film/television management. New York University's MA in Arts Administration program allows students to choose a visual arts or a performing arts focus.

Increasingly, the AAAE ([[Association of Arts Administration Educators]]) membership has become more interested and proactive in responding to key issues in the arts and in offering help to arts organizations on management, policy, governance, fund development, and financial issues.  As a result of this new commitment, research in the program is growing in both amount and quality.

Arts administrators have the ability to create and administer necessary professional development to fine arts teachers. Professional development for the arts is often subpar due to a lack in finances from the government's allotted funding, which can be remedied by the lobbying of arts administrators.  &lt;ref&gt;Gates, Leslie. “Professional Development: Through Collaborative Inquiry for an Art Education Archipelago.” Vol. 52, no. 1, 2010, pp. 6–17., {{jstor|25746078}} Accessed 16 Sept. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bareback sex''' is physical [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], especially [[sexual penetration]], without the use of a [[condom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Partridge |first1=Eric |year=2006|title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English: A-I |first2=Tom |last2=Dalzell |first3=Terry |last3=Victor|edition=reprint |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-25937-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YfsEgHLjboC |quote=Bareback - to engage in sex without a condom.|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; It most commonly refers to [[anal sex]] between [[men who have sex with men]] without the use of a condom, and may be distinguished from [[unprotected sex]] because of the deliberate act of forgoing condom use that is associated with it.&lt;ref name="Drescher"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Jack Drescher, Perry Halkitis, Leo Wilton| title =Barebacking: Psychosocial and Public Health Approaches|publisher =[[CRC Press]]|year = 2006|pages=150–151|accessdate = September 11, 2016| isbn = 978-0789021748|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=DR4x0gJcsTUC&amp;pg=PA150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aggleton"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Peter Aggleton, Richard Parker| title =Routledge Handbook of Sexuality, Health and Rights|publisher =[[Routledge]]|year = 2010|pages=391–393|accessdate = September 11, 2016| isbn = 978-1135272876|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=mlmOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[slang]] term, ''bareback sex'' comes from the [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] term ''[[bareback riding|bareback]],'' which refers to the practice of riding a [[horse]] without a [[saddle]].

==Etymology==
It is not known when the term (as sexual slang) was first used, although its use did gain momentum in the 1960s with the first appearance in print (as analogous reference) occurring in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Bernard and Joseph Bensman|title=Sexual Patterns in Three Ethnic Subcultures of an American Underclass|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=1968|issue=376|page=70|quote=Risk or no risk, boys are generally hostile to the idea of prophylaxis. One objection is phrased purely in terms of the pleasure principle, most colorfully by a Chicago boy who explains why he never uses anything like a rubber, ‘I tried it once. lt's like riding a horse with a saddle instead of bareback.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was used by [[G.I. (military)|G.I.'s]] during the [[Vietnam War]] when sex without the use of a condom was known as "going in" or "riding" bareback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Gregory R.|title=Words of the Vietnam War: the Slang, Jargon. . .[etc.]|date=1990|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=978-0899504650|page=437|quote=(under “Ride Bareback”) “GI slang for having sexual intercourse without using a condom. See also p. 66 (under “Boom-Boom”) “A GI that had his sex without the use of a condom was known as ‘going in’ or ‘riding’ bareback.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was included in the 1972 publication, ''Playboy's Book of Forbidden Words: A Liberated Dictionary of Improper English''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Robert Anton|title=Playboy's Book of Forbidden Words: A Liberated Dictionary of Improper English|date=1972|publisher=Playboy Press|page=20|quote=BAREBACK - Intercourse without any form of contraception, as in "They went at it bareback."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term appeared occasionally in print until the 1980s and then in context to the [[Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS|AIDS epidemic]] and the discussion of sexual practices. It did not have widespread use in [[LGBT culture]] until 1997, when there was an increase of discussion regarding condomless sex (as reflected in print publications).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peyser|first1=Marc|title=A Deadly Dance: As AIDS Cases Decline Sharply, Some Gay Men Are Returning to Unsafe Sex. They Call It Barebacking|journal=Newsweek|date=September 29, 1997|volume=130|issue=13|page=136|quote=See also The Advocate (Jul 8, 1997) p. 34 (and other various references in 1997; Out [Magazine] (6:1-6) 1997 (various references throughout.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and culture==
{{Further|Condom}}
Initially used for [[contraception|contraceptive]] purposes, condoms also came to be used to limit or prevent [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs), even after other contraceptive methods were developed. As [[AIDS]] emerged and the sexual transmission of [[HIV]] became known in the 1980s, the use of condoms to prevent infection became much more widespread, especially among [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) who engage in [[anal sex]]. At the beginning of the AIDS crisis, in the context of the invention and development of [[safe sex]], the uptake of condoms among Western MSM was so widespread and effective that condom use became established as a norm for sex between men. From 1995, several high-profile HIV positive men{{who|date=April 2012}} declared their refusal to wear condoms with other HIV positive men in gay publications, dubbing the practice ''barebacking.'' While these early articulations of barebacking expressed a concern for HIV prevention, in that they generally referred to dispensing with condoms in the context of sex between people of the same HIV status, the [[moral panic]] which ensued was so pronounced that barebacking came to be framed as a rebellious and transgressive erotic practice for HIV positive and HIV negative people alike, irrespective of the risks of HIV transmission.&lt;ref name="Race 2010"&gt;{{citation |last=Race |first=Kane |year=2010 |title=Engaging in a Culture of Barebacking: Gay Men and the Risk of HIV Prevention|journal=HIV Treatment and Prevention Technologies in International Perspective |isbn=978-0-230-23819-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resurgence and stigma===

A resurgence of barebacking in first-world gay communities during the 1990s has been a frequent topic for gay columnists and editorialists in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', [[Genre magazine|''Genre'' magazine]], and [[Out Magazine|''Out'' magazine]].&lt;ref name=Finlayson1998&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Human Condition: Johnny be good |last=Finlayson |first=Iain |authorlink=Iain Finlayson |date=21 June 1998 |newspaper=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-human-condition-johnny-be-good-1166398.html |quote=Whatever happened to that condom moment? 'Bareback', or unprotected, sex is still practiced by up to a third of gay men - because, despite the dangers, it feels liberated, sensuous and like one in the eye for 'sex police'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these articles express concern over bareback sex's popularity, and liken it to irresponsible and reckless behavior, despite the fact that a third of gay men take part in the practice.&lt;ref name=Finlayson1998/&gt; An article in the online resource ''The Body'' lists no fewer than 22 reasons why barebacking has become increasingly acceptable in the gay community.&lt;ref name=sowadsky&gt;See Rick Sowadsky, "Barebacking in the Gay Community," [http://www.thebody.com/content/art2276.html The Body] (May, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reasons listed are: the recent perception of HIV as a treatable illness one can live with, insufficient sex education, use of drugs such as crystal meth in sexual settings, and fetishization of bareback sex on various porn and dating sites.

Academic works suggest that barebacking is a way to reach for transcendence, to overcome the boredom of everyday average life in a hyper-rationalized society.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Holmes |first=Dave |year=2006 |title=Raw Sex as Limit Experience: A Foucauldian Analysis of Unsafe Anal Sex between Men |last2=O'Byrne |first2=Patrick |last3=Gastaldo |first3=Denise |journal=Social Theory &amp; Health |pages=319–333 |volume=4.4 |issue=4 |issn=1477-8211 |oclc=366722101 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.sth.8700077}} and {{citation |last=Martin |first=James |year=2006 |title=Transcendence Among Gay Men: Implications for HIV Prevention |journal=Sexualities |pages=214–235 |volume=9.2 |issue=2 |issn=1363-4607 |oclc=441346802 |doi=10.1177/1363460706058398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some men are dispensing with condoms in the context of seroconcordant sex (sex between two men of the same HIV status). Early articulations of barebacking generally refer to sex between two HIV-positive men. This poses no risk of infecting an HIV-negative person newly with HIV (though it can cause [[HIV superinfection|infection with a new strain of HIV]], hastening disease progression). On this account, barebacking could be considered an early harm reduction strategy, similar to [[serosorting]], which was later endorsed by some public health authorities in the USA.&lt;ref name="Race 2010"/&gt;

Bareback sex has also become more acceptable since the introduction of [[pre exposure prophylaxis]] (PrEP). One of the most popular forms of PrEP is [[Truvada]], a medication previously taken for HIV treatment that, when taken properly, has been shown to prevent HIV-negative users from contracting HIV from infected partners. While these drugs do not necessarily prevent the transmission of other STIs, they have stirred a discussion on what "safe" sex without the use of condoms really entails.

A 2005 study by Perry N. Halkitis concluded that the resurgence of barebacking led to an increase in sexually transmitted infections among the MSM community. The study found that of the 448 men who were familiar with barebacking, nearly half reported they had bareback sex in the last three months. In the San Francisco study, fewer men reported engaging in barebacking when the behavior was defined as intentional unprotected anal intercourse with a non-primary partner. Using this definition, 14% of the 390 men who were aware of barebacking reported engaging in the behavior in the past two years. Halkitis and Richard Wolitski also found that HIV-positive MSM were more likely to have bareback sex than were HIV-negative MSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Halkitis PN, Drescher J, Wilton L |title=Barebacking: psychosocial and public health approaches |journal=Gay and Lesbian Psychotherapy |volume=9 |issue=3/4 |pages=14–15 |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7890-2174-8 |doi=10.1300/j236v09n03_01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study by Joseph Brennan used textual analysis to read discourse on gay pornography performer Jake Lyons and his decision to perform for bareback studios. Brennan explored the stigma attached to the practice, in particular narratives of 'disposal and disgust' that became associated with the performer, and contributed to a decline in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brennan|first1=Joseph|title=‘Bare-backing spoils everything.

===Bugchasing===

An extreme form of barebacking is [[bugchasing]], in which seronegative gay men actively seek to be infected with HIV.&lt;ref name="Drescher"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory A. Freeman, "In Search of Death," ''Rolling Stone'', January 23, 2003 https://web.archive.org/web/20100406023402/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chasers; Gemma Aldridge, "Bug chasing: Men deliberately trying to catch HIV for sexual thrill in astonishing craze", ''Mirror'', July 7, 2013, https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/bug-chasing-men-deliberately-trying-2033433&lt;/ref&gt; These men may seek to contract HIV in order to not have to constantly live in fear of becoming infected.&lt;ref name="Drescher"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Brandon Andrew. 2014. "Barebacking with Weber: Re-enchanting the Rational Sexual Order." Social Theory &amp; Health 12: 235-250. DOI: 10.1057/sth.2014.4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gay pornographic films===
Bareback [[gay pornography]] was standard in "pre-condom" films from the 1970s and early 1980s. As awareness of the risk of AIDS developed, pornography producers came under pressure to use condoms, both for the health of the performers and to serve as role models for their viewers. By the early 1990s new pornographic videos usually featured the use of condoms for anal sex. However, beginning in the 1990s, an increasing number of studios have been devoted to the production of new films featuring men engaging in unprotected sex.&lt;ref name=hivscandalbbc&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7277000.stm|title=HIV scandal in gay porn industry|first=Madeleine|last=Holt|work=[[BBC]]|date=4 March 2008|accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[San Francisco]]-based studio [[Treasure Island Media]], whose work focuses in this area, has produced bareback films since 1999. Other companies that do so include [[Spunk Video]], [[Lucas Entertainment]], SEVP, and [[Eurocreme]]. Mainstream gay pornographic studios such as [[Kristen Bjorn]] Productions have featured the occasional bareback scene such as in "El Rancho" between performers who are real-life partners. Other studios such as [[Falcon Entertainment]] and Spunk Video have also reissued older pre-condom films.&lt;ref&gt;"Bareback Classics" (FVS 301) is an example of such a re-issue by Falcon. For Spunk Video reissues, see Christopher Rage.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, mainstream studios that consistently use condoms for anal sex scenes may sometimes choose editing techniques that make the presence of condoms somewhat ambiguous and less visually evident, and thus may encourage viewers to fantasize that barebacking is taking place, even though the performers are following safer-sex protocols. (In contrast, some mainstream directors use close-up shots of condom packets being opened, etc., to help clearly establish for the viewer that the sex is not bareback.)

Some bareback pornography studios say that they do not inquire whether their models are HIV positive, but assume that they are infected. For example, Hot Desert Knights (HDK) was one of the studios that initially operated on the assumption that all of their bareback models were HIV positive.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Adams, "The Adams Report: The GayVN Awards Show Highlights" (2002), quotes Jackson Price, the then director of casting for HDK, as saying, "we assume everyone is positive," and as implying that HDK did not require disclosure of any model's HIV status. (This report no longer appears to be available online.)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2008 HDK announced that it would begin testing its models for HIV and engage in a process of "sero-sorting", which match HIV-positive performers with other HIV-positive performers, and negative with negative. Critics suggest that sero-sorting may not prevent the development of a multi-strain HIV [[HIV superinfection|"superinfection"]]. By contrast, [[BelAmi]] is one of the studios that claimed from the beginning to test their bareback models for HIV before allowing them to participate in condom-free scenes. A notice on the BelAmi website states: "all our performers are regularly tested for the presence of HIV or other communicable diseases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belamionline.com/vodstore/condomfree.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731202409/http://www.belamionline.com/vodstore/condomfree.asp|title=BelAmi Video On Demand|archivedate=31 July 2008|work=belamionline.com|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation]] was formed to promote and facilitate STD testing and safety precautions among pornographic film actors.

==Heterosexual bareback==
The term ''bareback sex'' is used less frequently among heterosexuals.&lt;ref name="aids.about.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aids.about.com/od/safersexresources/a/barebacking.htm|title=Link Between HIV Infection and Barebacking|author=Mark Cichocki, R.N.|work=About.com Health|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey by the [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene]] found that heterosexual women are more likely to bareback when engaging in anal sex than homosexual and bisexual men are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/04/23/survey-finds-more-straight-women-barebacking-than-gay-men/|title=Survey finds more straight women barebacking than gay men|work=PinkNews|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heterosexual bareback sex, as opposed to [[safe sex]] with condoms, poses an increased risk of STIs whether vaginally or anally, and an increased risk of [[pregnancy]].

== Health risks ==
In addition to sexually transmitted infections, mechanical trauma are the same as in [[anal sex]]. Unprotected anal sex is a risk factor for formation of [[antisperm antibodies]] (ASA) in the recipient. In some people, ASA may cause autoimmune [[infertility]]. Antisperm antibodies impair fertilization, negatively affect the [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] process and impair growth and development of the [[embryo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Restrepo|first=B.|last2=Cardona-Maya|first2=W.|date=October 2013|title=Antisperm antibodies and fertility association|journal=Actas Urologicas Espanolas|volume=37|issue=9|pages=571–578|doi=10.1016/j.acuro.2012.11.003|issn=1699-7980|pmid=23428233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfK8AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA311|title=Principles &amp; Practice of Assisted Reproductive Technology (3 Vols)|last=Rao|first=Kamini|date=2013-09-30|publisher=JP Medical Ltd|year=|isbn=9789350907368|location=|pages=311|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carl Spitzweg 021.jpg|thumb|upright|[[The Bookworm (painting)|''The Bookworm'']], 1850, by [[Carl Spitzweg]]]]

'''Bibliophilia''' or '''bibliophilism''' is the love of books, and a '''bibliophile''' or '''bookworm''' is an individual who loves and frequently reads books, though bookworm is normally used pejoratively.

==Profile==
The classic bibliophile is one who loves to read, admire and collect books, often amassing a large and specialized collection. Bibliophiles usually possess books they love or that hold special value as well as old editions with unusual bindings, [[autograph]]ed, and/or illustrated copies.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=John|title=ABC for Book Collectors|year=1952|url=http://www.ilab.org/download.php?object=documentation&amp;id=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage of the term==
Bibliophilia is not to be confused with [[bibliomania]], a potential symptom of [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] involving the collecting of books to the extent that [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal relations]] or health may be negatively affected, and in which the mere fact that a physical object is a book is sufficient for it to be collected or beloved. Some use the term "bibliomania" interchangeably with "bibliophily", and in fact, the [[Library of Congress]] does not use the term "bibliophily," but rather refers to its readers as either book collectors or bibliomaniacs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/index.html Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[The New York Public Library]] follows the same practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catnyp.nypl.org/search/a?a New York Public library search]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to Arthur H. Minters, the "private collecting of books was a fashion indulged in by many [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], including [[Cicero]] and [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Collecting Books for Fun and Profit
|last=Minters
|first=Arthur H.
|location=New York
|publisher=Arco Publishing Inc.
|year=1979
|isbn=0-668-04598-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''bibliophile'' entered the [[English language]] in 1824.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bibliophile Merriam-Webster: bibliophile]&lt;/ref&gt; A bibliophile is to be distinguished from the much older notion of a bookman (which dates back to 1583), who is one who loves books, and especially [[Reading (process)|reading]]; more generally, a bookman is one who participates in writing, publishing, or selling books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bookman Merriam-Webster: bookman]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Lord Spencer]] and the [[George Spencer-Churchill, 5th Duke of Marlborough|Marquess of Blandford]] were noted bibliophiles. "The [[John Ker, 3rd Duke of Roxburghe|Roxburghe]] sale quickly became a foundational myth for the burgeoning secondhand book trade, and remains so to this day"; this sale is memorable due to the competition between "Lord Spencer and the marquis of Blandford [which] drove [the price of a probable first edition of Boccaccio's ''[[Decameron]]'' up to the astonishing and unprecedented sum of £2,260".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Connell|first=Philip|title=Book Collecting: Cultural Politics, and the Rise of Literary Heritage in Romantic Britain|journal=Representations|year=2000|volume=71|pages=24–47|doi=10.1525/rep.2000.71.1.01p00764}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. P. Morgan]] was also a noted bibliophile. In 1884, he paid $24,750 for a 1459 edition of the [[Mainz Psalter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Basbanes|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas A.

'''CC chemokine receptors''' (or '''beta chemokine receptors''') are [[integral membrane protein]]s that specifically bind and respond to [[cytokine]]s of the [[chemokine#CC chemokines|CC chemokine]] family.  They represent one subfamily of [[chemokine receptor]]s, a large family of [[G protein-coupled receptor|G protein-linked receptors]] that are known as seven transmembrane (7-TM) proteins since they span the cell membrane seven times.  To date, ten true members of the CC chemokine receptor subfamily have been described.  These are named CCR1 to CCR10 according to the IUIS/WHO Subcommittee on Chemokine Nomenclature.

==Mechanism==
The CC chemokine receptors all work by activating the [[G protein]] [[Gi alpha subunit|G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://senselab.med.yale.edu/NeuronDB/receptors2.aspx#Chemokine%20receptors,CC senselab]&lt;/ref&gt;

===CCR1===
[[CCR1]] was the first CC chemokine receptor identified and binds multiple [[inflammation|inflammatory]]/inducible (see [[inducible gene]]) CC chemokines (including [[CCL4]], [[CCL5]], [[CCL6]], [[CCL14]], [[CCL15]], [[CCL16]] and [[CCL23]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ma et al. The C10/CCL6 chemokine and CCR1 play critical roles in the pathogenesis of IL-13-induced inflammation and remodeling. J Immunol. 2004 Feb 1;172(3):1872-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Youn&gt;Youn et al. Molecular cloning of leukotactin-1: a novel human beta-chemokine, a chemoattractant for neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes, and a potent agonist at CC chemokine receptors 1 and 3. J. Immun. 159: 5201-5205, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = nomiyama&gt;Nomiyama et al. Human CC chemokine liver-expressed chemokine/CCL16 is a functional ligand for CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, and constitutively expressed by hepatocytes. Int Immunol. 2001 Aug;13(8):1021-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berahovich et al. Proteolytic Activation of Alternative CCR1 Ligands in Inflammation. J. Immunol. 174:7341-7351, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  In humans, this receptor can be found on [[peripheral blood lymphocytes]] and [[monocytes]].  There is some suggestion that this chemokine receptor is restricted to [[memory T-cells]] within the [[lymphocyte]] pool.  This receptor is also designated [[cluster of differentiation]] marker CD191.

===CCR2===
[[CCR2]] can interact with [[CCL2]], [[CCL8]] and [[CCL16]] and has been identified on the surface of [[monocytes]], activated [[memory T cells]], [[B cells]], and [[basophils]] in humans, and also in [[peritoneal]] [[macrophages]] in mice.&lt;ref name = nomiyama/&gt;&lt;ref name = ogilvie&gt;Ogilvie et al. Eotaxin is a natural antagonist for CCR2 and an agonist for CCR5. Blood. 2001, 97:1920-4&lt;/ref&gt;  CCR2 is also designated CD192.

===CCR3===
[[CCR3 (gene)|CCR3]] is a receptor for multiple inflammatory/inducible CC chemokines, including [[CCL11]], [[CCL26]], [[CCL7]], [[CCL13]], [[CCL15]], [[CCL24]] and [[CCL5]] that attract [[eosinophils]], and [[CCL28]] that attracts B and T [[lymphocyte]]s to [[mucosal tissue]]s. &lt;ref name = Youn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitaura et al. Molecular cloning of human eotaxin, an eosinophil-selective CC chemokine, and identification of a specific eosinophil eotaxin receptor, CC chemokine receptor 3. J. Biol. Chem. 1996, 271:7725-7730.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitaura et al. Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine (Eotaxin-3) that is a functional ligand of CC chemokine receptor 3. J. Biol. Chem. 274:27975-27980, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = pan&gt;Pan et al. 2000, A novel chemokine ligand for CCR10 and CCR3 expressed by epithelial cells in mucosal tissues, J. Immunol. 165: 2943–2949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White et al. Cloning and functional characterization of a novel human CC chemokine that binds to the CCR3 receptor and activates human eosinophils. J. Leukoc. Biol. 62:667-675, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; It is most highly expressed in both [[eosinophils]] and [[basophils]], but can also be found in [[Th1 cell|Th1]] and [[Th2]] cells and airway [[epithelial cells]]. Thus CCR3 plays a role in allergic reactions. CCR3 is also known as [[CD193]].

===CCR4===
[[CCR4]] is expressed on Th2 [[T lymphocytes]] and is up-regulated by [[T cell receptor]] activation.  However, some reports suggest a role for this receptor also in trafficking of [[dendritic cells]].  The CC chemokines [[CCL3]], [[CCL5]], [[CCL17]] and [[CCL22]] signal through this receptor.&lt;ref&gt;Imai et al. The T cell-directed CC chemokine TARC is a highly specific biological ligand for CC chemokine receptor 4. J. Biol. Chem. 272: 15036-15042, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Imai et al. Macrophage-derived chemokine is a functional ligand for the CC chemokine receptor 4. J. Biol. Chem. 273:1764-1768 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

===CCR5===
[[CCR5]] is expressed on several cell types including peripheral blood-derived [[dendritic cells]], CD34+ [[hematopoietic]] [[progenitor]] cells and certain activated/memory [[T cell|Th1 lymphocytes]]. This receptor is well defined as a major coreceptor implicated in susceptibility to [[HIV-1]] infection and disease.  This receptor has several CC chemokine ligands including [[CCL2]], [[CCL3]], [[CCL4]], [[CCL5]], [[CCL11]], [[CCL13]], [[CCL14]] and [[CCL16]].&lt;ref name = nomiyama/&gt;&lt;ref name = ogilvie/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gong et al., Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-2 Activates CCR5 and Blocks CD4/CCR5-mediated HIV-1 Entry/Replication. J Biol Chem, 1998, 273,4289-4292.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blanpain et al., CCR5 binds multiple CC-chemokines: MCP-3 acts as a natural antagonist. Blood. 1999, 94:1899-905.&lt;/ref&gt;

===CCR6===
[[CCR6]], a receptor for [[CCL20]], is expressed on unactivated [[memory T-cells]] and some [[dendritic cells]]. CCR6 is also expressed on Th17 cells.&lt;ref&gt;Acosta-Rodriguez et al., Surface phenotype and antigenic specificity of human interleukin 17–producing T helper memory cells. Nat. Immunology, 2007, 6, 639-646.&lt;/ref&gt;  CCR6 is down-regulated in activated T-cells.&lt;ref&gt;Baba et al., Identification of CCR6, the specific receptor for a novel lymphocyte-directed CC chemokine LARC. J Biol Chem. 1997, 272:14893-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===CCR7===
[[CCR7]] is a highly important receptor with a role in trafficking of B and T lymphocytes and [[dendritic cells]] to and across [[high endothelial venules]] and positioning those cells correctly in T cell zones of secondary [[lymphoid organs]].  Its ligands include the related chemokines [[CCL19]] and [[CCL21]], (previously called ELC and SLC).&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida et al. Molecular cloning of a novel human CC chemokine EBI1-ligand chemokine that is a specific ligand for EBI1, CCR7. J. Biol. Chem. 272: 13803-13809, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===CCR8===
[[CCR8]] is associated with Th2 lymphocytes and is therefore found predominantly in the [[thymus]] (in humans) although some expression can be found in the brain, [[spleen]], [[lymph node]], and monocytes at the [[nucleotide]] level.  The ligands for this receptor are [[CCL1]] and [[CCL16]].&lt;ref&gt;Roos et al., Identification of CCR8, the receptor for the human CC chemokine I-309. J Biol Chem 1997 Vol 272, 17251–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===CCR9===
[[CCR9]] was previously called [[orphan receptor]] GPR 9-6 and is very highly expressed in thymus (on both immature and mature T-cells) while low in lymph nodes and spleen. CCR9 is also abundant in the gut, with its expression associated with T cells of the [[intestine]].  The specific ligand of this receptor is [[CCL25]].&lt;ref&gt;Zaballos et al., Identification of the orphan chemokine receptor GPR-9-6 as CCR9, the receptor for the chemokine TECK. J. Immunol., 1999, 162:5671-5675.&lt;/ref&gt;  To note, the chemokine binding protein D6 had previously been named CCR9, but this molecule is a [[scavenger receptor (immunology)|scavenger receptor]] not a true (signaling) chemokine receptor.

===CCR10===
[[CCR10]] is receptor for [[CCL27]] and [[CCL28]] that was originally called orphan receptor GPR2.&lt;ref name = pan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gosling et al., Cutting edge: identification of a novel chemokine receptor that binds dendritic cell- and T cell-active chemokines including ELC, SLC, and TECK. J Immunol. 2000, 164:2851-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Homey et al. The orphan chemokine receptor G protein-coupled receptor-2 (GPR-2, CCR10) binds the skin-associated chemokine CCL27 (CTACK/ALP/ILC). J. Immunol. 164:3465-3470, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang et al. 2000, Identification of a novel chemokine (CCL28), which binds CCR10 (GPR2). J. Biol. Chem. 275: 22313–22323.&lt;/ref&gt;  CCR10 has been implicated in inflammation of the skin, and has been shown to recruit [[regulatory T cells]] ([[Tregs]]) to mucosal layers.

===CCR11===
This molecule was originally designated CCR11 due to its ability to bind several CC chemokines (including [[CCL19]], [[CCL21]] and [[CCL25]]) and its structural similarity to chemokine receptors.  However, due to the inability of this molecule (also known as [[CCRL1]] and CCX CKR) to generate a signal following ligand interaction, it has been suggested that it is a scavenger receptor for chemokines and not a bona fide chemokine receptor. Thus CCRL1 should not be called CCR11 under the guidelines of the IUIS/WHO Subcommittee on Chemokine Nomenclature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4089">The '''chain-linked model''' or '''Kline model''' of innovation was introduced by mechanical engineer Stephen J. Kline in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;Kline (1985). Research, Invention, Innovation and Production: Models and Reality, Report INN-1, March 1985, Mechanical Engineering Department, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; and further described by Kline and economist [[Nathan Rosenberg]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, S.J. &amp; N. Rosenberg (1986). “An overview of innovation.” In R. Landau &amp; N. Rosenberg (eds.), The Positive Sum Strategy: Harnessing Technology for Economic Growth. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, pp. 275–305.&lt;/ref&gt; The chain-linked model is an attempt to describe complexities in the  [[innovation]] process. The model is regarded as Kline's most significant contribution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.stanford.edu/pr/97/971028kline.html Salisbury, David F., "Memorial for Stephen Kline; engineer, interdisciplinary thinker," news release, Stanford University, October 27, 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In the chain-linked model, new knowledge is not necessarily the driver for innovation.  Instead, the process begins with the identification of an unfilled market need.  This drives research and design, then redesign and production, and finally marketing, with complex [[feedback]] loops between all the stages.  There are also important feedback loops with the organization's and the world's stored base of knowledge, with new basic research conducted or commissioned as necessary, to fill in gaps. 

It is often contrasted with the so-called [[linear model of innovation]],&lt;ref&gt;Caraça, João,  Bengt-Åke Lundvall, and Sandro Mendonça (2009).  “The changing role of science in the innovation process: From Queen to Cinderella?” Technological Forecasting &amp; Social Change 76, 861–867.&lt;/ref&gt; in which basic research leads to applied development, then engineering, then manufacturing, and finally marketing and distribution.

==Applications==
The Kline model was conceived primarily with commercial industrial settings in mind, but has found broad applicability in other settings, for example in military technology development.&lt;ref&gt;Marius Vassiliou, Stan Davis, and Jonathan Agre (2011).  Innovation Patterns in Some Successful C2 Technologies." Proc. 16th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium, Quebec, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;  Variations and extensions of the model have been described by a number of investigators.&lt;ref&gt;Kameoka, A., D.

'''Computational lithography''' (also known as '''computational scaling''') is the set of mathematical and algorithmic approaches designed to improve the resolution attainable through [[photolithography]]. Computational lithography has come to the forefront of [[photolithography]] in 2008 as the [[semiconductor industry]] grappled with the challenges associated with the transition to [[22 nanometer]] [[CMOS]] [[process technology]] and beyond.

==193 nm deep UV photolithography==

The periodic enhancement in the resolution achieved through [[photolithography]] has been a driving force behind [[Moore's Law]]. Resolution improvements enable printing of smaller geometries on an [[integrated circuit]]. The minimum feature size that a projection system typically used in [[photolithography]] can print is given approximately by:

:&lt;math&gt;CD = k_1 \cdot\frac{\lambda}{NA}&lt;/math&gt;
where

&lt;math&gt;\,CD&lt;/math&gt; is the [[minimum feature size]] (also called the '''critical dimension''').

&lt;math&gt;\,\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavelength]] of light used.

&lt;math&gt;\,NA&lt;/math&gt; is the [[numerical aperture]] of the lens as seen from the wafer.

&lt;math&gt;\,k_1&lt;/math&gt; (commonly called ''k1 factor'') is a coefficient that encapsulates process-related factors.

Historically, resolution enhancements in [[photolithography]] have been achieved through the progression of [[stepper]] illumination sources to smaller and smaller wavelengths &amp;mdash; from "g-line" (436&amp;nbsp;nm) and "i-line" (365&amp;nbsp;nm) sources based on [[mercury lamp]]s, to the current systems based on [[deep ultraviolet]] [[excimer laser]]s sources at 193&amp;nbsp;nm. However the progression to yet finer wavelength sources has been stalled by the intractable problems associated with [[extreme ultraviolet lithography]] and [[x-ray lithography]], forcing semiconductor manufacturers to extend the current 193&amp;nbsp;nm optical lithography systems until some form of [[next-generation lithography]] proves viable (although 157&amp;nbsp;nm steppers have also been marketed, they have proven cost-prohibitive at $50M each).&lt;ref name="Electronics2004"&gt;{{Citation | title = Reticle enhancement technology will extend life of 193nm litho | newspaper = Electronics Weekly | date = 2004-02-25 | url = http://www.electronicsweekly.com/Articles/2004/02/25/701/reticle-enhancement-technology-will-extend-life-of-193nm-litho-says.htm | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to improve resolution by increasing the numerical aperture have led to the use of [[immersion lithography]]. As further improvements in resolution through wavelength reduction or increases in numerical aperture have become either technically challenging or economically unfeasible, much attention has been paid to reducing the k1-factor. The k1 factor can be reduced through process improvements, such as [[phase-shift photomask]]s. These techniques have enabled [[photolithography]] at the [[32 nanometer]] CMOS process technology node using a wavelength of 193&amp;nbsp;nm (deep ultraviolet). However, with the [[International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors|ITRS roadmap]] calling for the [[22 nanometer]] node to be in use by 2011, photolithography researchers have had to develop an additional suite of improvements to make 22&amp;nbsp;nm technology manufacturable.&lt;ref name="Moretti2008"&gt;{{Citation | last = Moretti | first = Gabe | title = Custom litho addresses 22-nm IC manufacturing | newspaper = EETimes | pages = | date = 2008-10-13 | url = http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=211200162 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the increase in mathematical modeling has been underway for some time, the degree and expense of those calculations has justified the use of a new term to cover the changing landscape: computational lithography.

==History ==
Computational lithography means the use of computers to simulate printing of micro-lithography structures. Pioneering work was done by [[Chris Mack (scientist)|Chris Mack]] at NSA in developing [[PROLITH]], Rick Dill at IBM and Andy Neureuther at University of California, Berkeley from the early 1980s. These tools were limited to lithography process optimization as the algorithms were limited to a few square micrometres of resist. Commercial full-chip optical proximity correction, using model forms, was first implemented by TMA (now a subsidiary of [[Synopsys]]) and Numerical Technologies (also part of Synopsys) around 1997.&lt;ref name="TMA1997"&gt;{{Citation | title = Major US Semiconductor Maker Chooses TMA for OPC Software | newspaper = PRNewswire | pages = | date = 1997-10-16 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19915757.html | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since then the market and complexity has grown significantly. With the move to sub-wavelength lithography at the 180&amp;nbsp;nm and 130&amp;nbsp;nm nodes, RET techniques such as Assist features, phase shift masks started to be used together with OPC. For the transition from 65&amp;nbsp;nm to 45&amp;nbsp;nm nodes customers were worrying that not only that design rules were insufficient to guarantee printing without yield limiting hotspots, but also that tape-out time may need thousands of CPUs or weeks of run time. This predicted exponential increase in computational complexity for mask synthesis on moving to the 45&amp;nbsp;nm process node spawned a significant venture capital investment in  [[design for manufacturability (IC)|design for manufacturing]] start-up companies.&lt;ref name="DylanMcGrathDFM2005"&gt;{{Citation | last = McGrath | first = Dylan | title = DFM pumps up the volume | newspaper = EETimes | pages =| date = 2005-12-16 | url = http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=175004316&amp;queryText=tcad&amp;printable=true&amp;printable=true | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A number of startup companies promoting their own disruptive solutions to this problem started to appear, techniques from custom hardware acceleration to radical new algorithms such as Inverse Lithography were touted to resolve the forthcoming bottlenecks. Despite this activity, incumbent OPC suppliers were able to adapt and keep their major customers, with RET and OPC being used together as for previous nodes, but now on more layers and with larger data files, and turn around time concerns were met by new algorithms and improvements in multi-core commodity processors. The term computational lithography was first used by Brion Technology (now a subsidiary of [[ASML Holding|ASML]]) in 2005&lt;ref name="DylanMcGrath2005"&gt;{{Citation | last = McGrath | first = Dylan | title = Litho simulation vendor opens Japanese subsidiary | newspaper = EETimes | pages = | date = 2005-02-12 | url = http://www.eetimes.com/news/semi/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=174900246 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote their hardware accelerated full chip lithography simulation platform. Since then the term has been used by the industry to describe full chip mask synthesis solutions.  As 45&amp;nbsp;nm goes into full production and EUV lithography introduction is delayed, 32&amp;nbsp;nm and 22&amp;nbsp;nm are expected to run on existing 193&amp;nbsp;nm scanners technology. 

Now, not only are throughput and capabilities concerns resurfacing, but also new computational lithography techniques such as source mask optimization (SMO) is seen as a way to squeeze better resolution specific to a given design. Today, all the major mask synthesis vendors have settled on the term "computational lithography" to describe and promote the set of mask synthesis technologies required for 22&amp;nbsp;nm.

==Techniques comprising computational lithography==
Computational lithography makes use of a number of numerical simulations to improve the performance (resolution and contrast) of cutting-edge photomasks.   The combined techniques include [[Resolution enhancement technologies|Resolution Enhancement Technology]] (RET), [[Optical Proximity Correction]] (OPC), Source Mask Optimization (SMO), etc.&lt;ref name="LaPedus2008"&gt;{{Citation | last = LaPedus | first = Mark | title = IBM rolls 'computational scaling' for litho at 22-nm | newspaper = EETimes | pages = | date = 2008-09-17 | url = http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=210602297 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques vary in terms of their technical feasibility and engineering sensible-ness, resulting in the adoption of some and the continual R&amp;D of others.&lt;ref name="LamWong2009"&gt;{{Citation | author = E. Lam | author2 = A. Wong | title = Computation lithography: virtual reality and virtual virtuality | journal = Optics Express | volume = 17 | pages = 12259–12268 | year = 2009 | url = http://www.opticsinfobase.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-17-15-12259 | doi = 10.1364/OE.17.012259 | pmid = 19654627 | issue = 15 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resolution enhancement technology ===
[[Resolution enhancement technologies]], first used in the [[90 nanometer]] generation, using the mathematics of [[diffraction optics]] to specify multi-layer [[phase-shift photomask]]s that use interference patterns in the photomask that enhance resolution on the printed wafer surface.

===Optical proximity correction ===
[[Optical proximity correction]] uses computational methods to counteract the effects of diffraction-related blurring and under-exposure by modifying on-mask geometries with means such as:
adjusting linewidths depending on the density of surrounding geometries (a trace surrounded by a large open area will be over-exposed compared with the same trace surrounded by a dense pattern), 
adding "dog-bone" endcaps to the end of lines to prevent line shortening, 
correcting for [[proximity effect (electron beam lithography)|electron beam proximity effects]]

OPC can be broadly divided into rule-based and model-based.&lt;ref name="opc"&gt;{{Citation | author=A. Wong | title=Resolution enhancement techniques in optical lithography | publisher=SPIE Press | year=2001 | postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inverse lithography technology, which treats the OPC as an inverse imaging problem, is also a useful technique because it can provide unintuitive mask patterns.&lt;ref name="sectioning"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-16-19-14746 | author=S. Chan | author2=A. Wong | author3=E. Lam | title=Initialization for robust inverse synthesis of phase-shifting masks in optical projection lithography | journal=[[Optics Express]] | volume=16 |issue=19 | pages=14746–14760 | year=2008 | doi=10.1364/OE.16.014746 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complex modeling of the lens system and photoresist===
Beyond the models used for RET and OPC, computational lithographics attempts to improve chip manufacturability and yields such as by using the signature of the scanner to help improve accuracy of the OPC model:&lt;ref name="SynopsysNikon2007"&gt;{{Citation |last         = Hand |first        = Aaron |title        = Nikon and Synopsys Deliver on Advanced OPC Promise |newspaper    = Semiconductor International |year         = 2007 |date         = November 2006 |url          = http://www.semiconductor.net/article/206698-Nikon_and_Synopsys_Deliver_on_Advanced_OPC_Promise.php |postscript   = &lt;!--none--&gt; |access-date  = 2010-01-15 |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090809002450/http://www.semiconductor.net/article/206698-Nikon_and_Synopsys_Deliver_on_Advanced_OPC_Promise.php |archive-date = 2009-08-09 |dead-url     = yes |df           = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
polarization characteristics of the lens pupil,
[[Jones calculus|Jones matrix]] of the stepper lens,
optical parameters of the [[photoresist]] stack,
diffusion through the photoresist,
stepper illumination control variables.

==A CPU-century worth of calculations or more==
The computational effort behind these methods is immense.  According to one estimate, the calculations required to adjust OPC geometries to take into account variations to focus and exposure for a state-of-the-art integrated circuit will take approximately 100 CPU-years of computer time.&lt;ref name="Wiley2006"&gt;{{Citation | last = Wiley | first = Jim | title = Future challenges in computational lithography | newspaper = Solid State Technology

Brion Technologies, a subsidiary of [[ASML Holding|ASML]], the largest manufacturer of photolithography systems, markets a rack-mounted hardware accelerator dedicated for use in making computational lithographic calculations &amp;mdash; a mask-making shop can purchase a large number of their systems to run in parallel. Others have claimed significant acceleration using re-purposed off-the-shelf graphics cards for their high parallel throughput.&lt;ref name="Gauda2008"&gt;{{Citation | last = LaPedus | first = Mark | title = Gauda claims OPC acceleration breakthrough. | newspaper = EE Times | date = 2008-02-28 | url = http://www.eetimes.com/news/design/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=206801681 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Discussion on the brain's criticality have been done since 1950, with the paper on the imitation game for a Turing test.&lt;ref&gt;Turing, A. M. Computing machinery and intelligence. Mind 59, 433–460 (1950).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Herz and Hopfield noted that self-organized criticality (SOC) models for earthquakes were mathematically equivalent to networks of integrate-and-fire neurons, and speculated that perhaps SOC would occur in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Herz, A. V. &amp; Hopfield, J. J. Earthquake cycles and neural reverberations: collective oscillations in systems with pulse-coupled threshold elements. Physical Review Letters 75, 1222 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously Stassinopoulos and  Bak proposed a simple neural network model working at criticality&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stassinopoulos|first=Dimitris|last2=Bak|first2=Per|date=1995-05-01|title=Democratic reinforcement: A principle for brain function|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevE.51.5033|journal=Physical Review E|volume=51|issue=5|pages=5033–5039|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.51.5033|bibcode=1995PhRvE..51.5033S}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was expanded latter by Chialvo and Bak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chialvo|first=D.R.|last2=Bak|first2=P.|title=Learning from mistakes|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0306-4522(98)00472-2|journal=Neuroscience|volume=90|issue=4|pages=1137–1148|doi=10.1016/s0306-4522(98)00472-2|arxiv=adap-org/9707006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the hypothesis found experimental support by Beggs and Plenz&lt;ref&gt;Beggs, J. M. &amp; Plenz, D. Neuronal avalanches in neocortical circuits. The Journal of Neuroscience 23, 11167–11177 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''EPCI''' stands for '''Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Installation''', a common form of contracting arrangement within [[offshore construction]]. The acronym '''EPIC''' for '''Engineering, Procurement, Installation &amp; Commissioning''' is also used. 

Under an EPCI contract, the contractor will design the structure(s), procure the necessary materials, undertake construction and transportation and set it up at the offshore site. The contractor does this either through own labor or by subcontracting part of the work. The contractor carries the project risk for schedule as well as budget in return for a fixed price, called [[lump sum]] or [[LSTK]] depending on the agreed scope of work.&lt;ref name='Loots 2007'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docplayer.net/1176303-Article-worlds-apart-epc-and-epcm-contracts-risk-issues-and-allocation.html |title=Worlds Apart: EPC and EPCM Contracts:Risk issues and allocation |accessdate=2016-09-23 |last=Loots |first=Phil |author2=Henchie, Nick |date=November 2007 |format=PDF |publisher=Mayer Brown }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In EPCI contracts, the contractor rarely carries the project risk unconditionally. Rather, contractor and customer have detailed discussions on the division of the risk. Risk of delays and cost overruns due to lacking [[weather window]]s is an example of a typical risk that may be borne by the customer rather than the contractor.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

'''''Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness''''' is a documentary/art film released in June 2015 that takes audiences through farms and urban landscapes in [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], and the [[United States]], interviewing leading practitioners in the [[Natural farming|Natural Farming]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hong|first=Ryoseok|title=Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness|date=2000-01-01|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3709036/|last2=Kawaguchi|last3=Korn|first2=Yoshikazu|first3=Larry|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film began when an environmental artist (Patrick M. Lydon) and an environmental book editor (Suhee Kang), had a chance meeting in Seoul, South Korea, and began conducting short interviews together with leaders in the ecology and social justice movements. Upon meeting Korean farmer Seong Hyun Choi however, the two were so impressed by his ecological mindset and way of working, that they set out to produce a feature film about the movement. Lydon and Kang ended up quitting their jobs, giving away most of their possessions, and becoming voluntarily homeless for four years in order to afford producing the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kimchiandbasil.com/interview-final-straw/|title=Final straw: food, earth, happiness - Kimchi&amp;Basil|date=2016-02-20|work=Kimchi&amp;Basil|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/a-root-solution/|title=A ‘Root’ Solution {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/21/lydon-ghost-ship-raises-broad-questions-about-art-and-culture/|title=Lydon: Ghost Ship raises big questions about arts and culture|last=|first=|date=|website=San Jose Mercury News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is split into three sections 1) Modern Life, 2) Foundations and Mindset of Natural Farming, and 3) Natural Farming in Practice and Life. According to the filmmakers, as they began to understand more about how natural farming itself was not rooted in methods, but in a way of thinking, they chose to explore the life philosophies and ways of thinking of natural farming practitioners in a more free-flowing and artistic way, rather than an instructive one; the result is an unconventional documentary that features slow paced musical interludes alongside interviews. Reviewers have called both "meditative, and mindful," and "an inspiring call to action."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mindfulpie.com/one-straw-revolution/|title=Love nature, eat well – Mindful Pie|website=mindfulpie.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cleaneatingmag.com/|title=Eco Farming|last=|first=|date=July 1, 2015|work=Clean Eating Magazine|access-date=August 1, 2015|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=Active Interest Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and musician [[Alicia Bay Laurel]] called the film "both art and documentary".

== Production ==
Lydon and Kang spent what they call a "meager" life savings to make the film, along with the volunteer efforts of farmers, translators, writers, musicians they had met during their journey. Although the film was filmed, written, and edited entirely by the two directors, they readily admit that the process of making the film was co-operative effort, with more than 200 volunteers directly involved in the process in some way. The soundtrack was recorded with professional musicians from each of the three countries where filming took place, all of whom donated their time to contribute to the film project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/film-soundtrack-recording-with-windsync/|title=Film Soundtrack Recording with WindSync {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the continued help of international volunteers, the film is available in four languages (English, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese), and three more (Chinese, Portuguese, French) are in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cbjournalism.com/2016/03/24/filmmaker-spotlight-patrick-lydon-suhee-king/|title=Filmmaker Spotlight: Patrick Lydon &amp; Suhee King|date=2016-03-24|website=Chelsea Breaks the News|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/film-soundtrack-recording-with-windsync/|title=Film Soundtrack Recording with WindSync {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/the-documentary/|title=The Documentary {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tour and critical reception ==

Frustrated by the lack of distribution and film festival options for low- and no-budget films, the filmmakers made the decision to manage distribution and touring in the same way they went about filming, through co-operative effort. With the help of volunteers, independent theater owners, and community organizers, they launched an extensive tour throughout Japan and South Korea from 2015-2016, eventually screening the film at over 130 venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/tour-dates-and-screenings/|title=Tour Dates and Screenings {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than simply screening the film, the filmmakers decided to transition their existing media production organization ''SocieCity,'' into a vehicle for art and community engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artseverywhere.ca/2016/03/07/social-practice-artwork-a-restaurant-and-garden-serving-up-connections-to-urban-nature/|title=Social Practice Artwork: A Restaurant and Garden Serving up Connections to Urban Nature|last=|first=|date=|website=artseverywhere.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They made a point of hosting interactive events along with their screenings and in several cases, stayed in communities for up to three months at a time to build natural gardens and host a project they call REALtimeFOOD, a grown-to-order restaurant which connects the ideas from the film with real-world practices in farming, food, and crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.naver.com/barndining_/220514125842|title=Bar&amp;Dining Magazine : 네이버 블로그|website=blog.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://setouchiexplorer.com/real-time-food-project-day-one-worlds-slowest-restaurant-opening/|title=REAL time FOOD Project - Day One - World's Slowest Restaurant Opening|date=2016-09-18|work=Setouchi Explorer|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, these efforts were funded by grants from local philanthropic organizations and/or supported by the communities themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chishimatochi.info/found/index.php/archives/service/1961|title=おおさか創造千島財団  » 2015年度|website=www.chishimatochi.info|language=ja|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sustainablepractice.org/2013/11/15/final-straw/|title=Final Straw|date=2013-11-15|website=The CSPA|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interested in the unconventional way the film was being made and toured, multiple magazines and newspapers in Japan and Korea followed the directors during several parts of their journey, notably ESSEN, Bar and Dining, and Road magazines, and Shikoku Shinbun and Huffington Post newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shikoku-newspaper-english.pdf|title=Connecting to Life with Natural Farming in Megijima|last=|first=|date=September 18, 2016|work=Shikoku Shinbun|access-date=17 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.kr/salimstory/story_b_8476176.html|title="모든 것이 연결되어 있다는 깨달음이 시작"|website=허핑턴포스트|language=ko-KR|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://navercast.naver.com/magazine_contents.nhn?rid=1095&amp;contents_id=45426|title=내일의 식문화를 일구는 사람들이 보내 온 새해 편지|access-date=2017-04-18|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the tour, the film was eventually picked up by festivals including Tassie Eco Film Festival and Belleville Doc Fest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://downtowndocfest.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Belleville%20Downtown%20DocFest%20Program_2016.pdf|title=Belleville International Documentary Festival - Official Program|last=|first=|date=1 February 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feelings may stem from any second language context whether it is associated with the productive skills of [[speech|speaking]] and [[writing]] or the receptive skills of [[reading (process)|reading]] and listening.&lt;ref name="MacIntyre"&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacIntyre |first=P.

Foreign language anxiety is a form of what [[psychologist]]s describe as a ''specific anxiety reaction''.&lt;ref name="Horwitz 125–132"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horwitz|first=Elaine K.|last2=Horwitz|first2=Michael B.|last3=Cope|first3=Joann|date=1986-06-01|title=Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-4781.1986.tb05256.x/abstract|journal=The Modern Language Journal|language=en|volume=70|issue=2|pages=125–132|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4781.1986.tb05256.x|issn=1540-4781}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some individuals are more predisposed to [[anxiety]] than others and may feel anxious in a wide variety of situations. Foreign language anxiety, however, is situation-specific and so it can also affect individuals who are not characteristically anxious in other situations.

==Causes==
{{expert needed|the subject, as much of the article is largely incoherent|date=July 2017}}
Although all aspects of using and learning a foreign language can cause anxiety, both listening and speaking are regularly cited as the most anxiety provoking of foreign language activities.&lt;ref name="MacIntyre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horwitz"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Horwirz |first=E. K. |last2=Horwitz |first2=M. B. |last3=Cope |first3=J. |year=1986 |title=Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety |journal=The Modern Language Journal |volume=70 |issue=ii |pages= |ref=harv |doi=10.2307/327317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign language anxiety is usually studied and seen in a language classroom situation. It has been argued that language learning is a "profoundly unsettling psychological proposition"&lt;ref name="Horwitz 125–132"/&gt; as it jeopardizes an individual's self-understanding and perspective.&lt;ref name="Horwitz 125–132"/&gt; Three theories of anxiety have been developed from internal appraisal, then more situational in learning language and contextual situation{{clarify|date=July 2017}}:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* self-efficacy and appraisal anxiety
* state, trait, situational anxiety
* situational anxiety in a classroom situation
Potential negative events that people cannot see or handle with their ability{{clarify|date=July 2017}} often leads to anxiety. Also, if individuals are highly anxious, that kind of habitualised reactions{{clarify|date=July 2017}} may cause those who have experienced many threatening situations in the past to be more likely perceive future situations as threatening. As well, if their anxiety are traits rather than states, self-efficacy must result from past successes, vicarious experiences and social persuasion.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pappamihiel|first1=N. Eleni|title=English as a Second Language Students and English Language Anxiety: Issues in the Mainstream Classroom|journal=Research in the Teaching of English|date=1 January 2002|volume=36|issue=3|pages=327–355|jstor=40171530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Self-efficacy'' is one's own confidence that he or she would be able to handle to achieve intended goals. ''State, trait, situational anxiety'' refers to those who have gotten traumatised a lot in the past being more likely to perceive the future situations as treating too. Also, specifically in an ESL classroom, students learning a foreign language out of their country are very vulnerable to high levels of anxiety about language learning, which leads them to being less likely to get encouraged by others because of lacking vicarious experience and social persuasions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

More specifically, foreign language anxiety is seen in a language classroom. As such, the causes of foreign language anxiety have been broadly separated into three main components: [[communication apprehension]], [[test anxiety]] and [[fear of negative evaluation]].&lt;ref name="Horwitz" /&gt; Communication apprehension is the anxiety experienced in speaking or listening to other individuals. Test-anxiety is a form of [[performance anxiety]] associated with the fear of doing badly or failing altogether. Fear of negative evaluation is the anxiety associated with the learner's perception of how other onlookers (instructors, classmates or others) may negatively view their language ability.

Sparks and Ganschow&lt;ref name="SparksGanschow1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sparks|first1=Richard L.|last2=Ganschow|first2=Leonore|title=Foreign Language Learning Differences: Affective or Native Language Aptitude Differences?|journal=The Modern Language Journal|volume=75|issue=1|year=1991|pages=3–16|issn=0026-7902|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4781.1991.tb01076.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; asked a question, which drew attention to the fact that anxiety could be a cause of poor language learning or a result of poor language learning. If a student is unable to study as required before writing a language examination, the student could experience test anxiety. Context anxiety could be viewed as a result. In contrast, anxiety becomes a cause of poor language learning when it was due to anxiety that student is unable to adequately learn the target language.

There can be various physical causes of anxiety, such as hormone levels, but the underlying causes of excessive anxiety while learning are fear&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shahsavari|first1=Mahmood|title=Relationship between anxiety and achievement motivation among male and female students|journal=Journal of American Science|date=2012|volume=8|issue=11|pages=329–332|url=http://www.jofamericanscience.org/journals/am-sci/am0811/048_11656am0811_329_332.pdf|accessdate=23 January 2017|publisher=AmericanScience.org / Marsland Press|issn=2375-7264&lt;!-- print: 1545-1003 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a lack of confidence. Lack of confidence itself can come from various causes. One reason can be the teaching approach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Riasati|first1=Mohammad Javad|title=Language Learning Anxiety from EFL Learners' Perspective|journal=Middle-East Journal of Scientific Research|date=2011|volume=7|issue=6|pages=907–914|url=http://idosi.org/mejsr/mejsr7(6)11/13.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826001617/http://idosi.org/mejsr/mejsr7(6)11/13.pdf|archive-date=26 August 2016|deadurl=no|accessdate=23 January 2017|publisher=IDOSI Publications|issn=1990-9233}}&lt;/ref&gt; used.

Furthermore, foreign language anxiety roots in three psychological challenges:
* performance difficulty
* threat
* identity conflict
Those psychological states thus have task-performance and identity dimensions. People tend to act or speak in a way that would be judged appropriate to the other people native to the foreign culture, but the behaviour that individuals are producing grapples with ingrained values and behaviours. Emotions by the psychological challenges has something to do with attempting to switch codes in an interactive encounter.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Molinsky|first1=Andrew|title=Cross-Cultural Code-Switching: The Psychological Challenges of Adapting Behavior in Foreign Cultural Interactions|journal=The Academy of Management Review|date=1 January 2007|volume=32|issue=2|pages=622–640|doi=10.2307/20159318|jstor=20159318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
The effects of foreign language anxiety are particularly evident in the foreign language classroom, and anxiety is a strong indicator of academic performance. Anxiety is found to have a detrimental effect on students' [[confidence]], [[self-esteem]] and level of participation.&lt;ref name="Horwitz" /&gt;

Anxious learners suffer detrimental effects during spontaneous speaking activities in performance, affective reactions and their overall attitudes towards learning their target second language&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Phillips |first=E. M. |year=1992 |title=The effects of language anxiety on students' oral test performance and attitudes |journal=The Modern Language Journal |volume=76 |issue= 1|pages=14-26 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-4781.1992.tb02573.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore, they may lack confidence, be less able to self-edit and identify language errors and more likely to employ [[avoidance coping|avoidance]] strategies such as skipping class.&lt;ref name="Gregerson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gregerson |first=T. |year=2003 |title=To err is human: A reminder to teachers of language-anxious students |journal=Foreign Language Annals |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=25–32 |doi= 10.1111/j.1944-9720.2003.tb01929.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anxious students also forget previously learned material, volunteer answers less frequently and tend to be more passive in classroom activities than their less anxious counterparts.&lt;ref name="Horwitz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ely"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ely |first=C. M. |year=1986 |title=An analysis of discomfort, risk-taking, sociability, and motivation in the L2 classroom |journal=Language Learning |volume=36 |issue= |pages=1–25 |doi= 10.1111/j.1467-1770.1986.tb00366.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of foreign language anxiety also extend outside the second language classroom. A high level of foreign language anxiety may also correspond with communication apprehension, causing individuals to be quieter and less willing to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liu |first=M. |last2=Jackson |first2=J. |year=2008 |title=An exploration of Chinese EFL learners’ Unwillingness to Communicate and Foreign Language Anxiety |journal=The Modern Language Journal |volume=92 |issue=i |pages=71–86 |doi= 10.1111/j.1540-4781.2008.00687.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who exhibit this kind of communication [[reticence]] can also sometimes be perceived as less trustworthy, less competent, less socially and physically attractive, tenser, less composed and less dominant than their less reticent counterparts.

=== Cross-cultural code-switching ===
The effects of these negative emotions may also lead to '''cross-cultural code-switching''', in which bilingual people alter a language to their other language{{clarify|date=July 2017}} through their interactions with other bilinguals. Unlike linguistic [[code-switching]], cross-cultural code-switching is the socio-linguistic phenomenon of changing culturally-ingrained behaviors in a foreign situation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although cross-cultural code-switching possibly results from both positive and negative emotions, negative emotions are more common and more likely to affect the way a bilingual person speaks. Negative emotions include embarrassment, performance anxiety, guilt, distress and anxiety.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molinsky|first=Andrew|date=2007-01-01|title=Cross-Cultural Code-Switching: The Psychological Challenges of Adapting Behavior in Foreign Cultural Interactions|jstor=20159318|journal=The Academy of Management Review|volume=32|issue=2|pages=622–640|doi=10.2307/20159318}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Molinsky identifies three psychological states that appraise under the influence of emotions while code-switching. These are: "experienced performance difficulty, face threat and identity conflict—all of which mediate the relationship between personal and contextual variables and the negative and positive emotions an individual experiences while code-switching".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.diplom.de/document/228636|title=Diplom.de - Cross-cultural Code Switching and Application|website=www.diplom.de|language=de|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three types of cross-cultural code-switching:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Titone|first=Renzo|date=1994-01-01|title=Some Italian Investigations of 'Code Switching' in Diglossic Settings: A Summary Report|jstor=30249052|journal=La Linguistique|volume=30|issue=2|pages=67–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* situational code-switching
* conversational code-switching
* borrowing
This code-switching could be considered as an unconscious behavior because of its negative and usually threatening situations.{{clarify|date=July 2017}} In that sense, although code-switching results from foreign language anxiety, it is more often caused by external circumstances than by internal mental change.{{clarify|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Measures==
A number of tools have been developed to investigate the level of foreign language anxiety experienced by language learners.

The Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS)&lt;ref name="Horwitz" /&gt; is a 33-question, 5-point [[Likert scale]] survey, which is widely used in research studies. It investigates participants' communication apprehension, test-anxiety and fear of negative evaluation and focuses on speaking in a classroom context. It has been translated and used in several languages, including [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].

Following the success of the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety scale, similar instruments have been devised for measuring Foreign Language Reading Anxiety (FLRAS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Saito |first=Y. |last2=Horwitz |first2=E. K. |last3=Garza |first3=T. J. |year=1999 |title=Foreign Language Reading Anxiety |journal=The Modern Language Journal |volume=83 |issue= |pages=202–218 |doi= 10.1111/0026-7902.00016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign Language Listening Anxiety (FLLAS) and Second Language Writing Apprehension (SLWAT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cheng |first=Y. S. |last2=Horwitz |first2=E. K. |last3=Shallert |first3=D. L. |year=1999 |title=Language anxiety: Differentiating writing and speaking components |journal=Language Learning |volume=49 |issue= |pages=417–446 |doi= 10.1111/0023-8333.00095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues and area of research ==
In the 1990s, the challenge was a clear categorisation of grammatical or sociolinguistic constraints on code-switching caused by foreign language anxiety and to determine how bilinguals produce different code-mixed patterns. In fact, previously, most researches focused more upon syntactic aspects on code-switching; in other words, psychological elements were completely ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Myers-Scotton|first1=Carol|title=Common and Uncommon Ground: Social and Structural Factors in Codeswitching|journal=Language in Society|date=1 January 1993|volume=22|issue=4|pages=475–503|jstor=4168471|doi=10.1017/s0047404500017449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1967">'''Fountas &amp; Pinnell reading levels''' (commonly referred to as "Fountas &amp; Pinnell") are a system of reading levels developed by Irene Fountas and Gay Su Pinnell to support their [[guided reading]] method.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;Fountas, I. C. &amp; Pinnell, G. S. (1996). Guided reading: Good first teaching for all children. Portsmith: Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt; Reading text is classified according to various parameters, such as word count, number of different words, number of [[high-frequency word]]s, sentence length, sentence complexity, word repetitions, illustration support, etc. While classification is guided by these parameters, syllable type, an important consideration in beginning reading, is not considered as part of the leveling system. Small books containing a combination of text and illustrations are then provided to educators for each level.&lt;ref name="books"&gt;[http://www.heinemann.com/fountasandpinnell/ Level books at heinemann.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 

While young children display a wide distribution of reading skills, each level is tentatively associated with a school grade. Some schools adopt target reading levels for their pupils. This is the grade-level equivalence chart recommended by Fountas &amp; Pinnell.&lt;ref name="chart"&gt;[http://www.heinemann.com/shared/supportingMaterials/benchmark/GradeLevelEquivalenceChart.pdf  Level equivalence chart]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fountasandpinnell.com/textlevelgradient/ F&amp;P Text Level Gradient™]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Freshwater Biological Association''' (FBA) is an independent scientific organisation founded in 1929. Whilst originally created to be a research station it has evolved into a Learned Society whose mission is to "promote the sustainable management of freshwater ecosystems and resources, underpinned by the best available science".&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;[http://www.fba.org.uk/mission-vision FBA's Mission]&lt;/ref&gt; The FBA promotes [[Limnology|freshwater science]] through innovative research, maintained specialist scientific facilities, a programme of scientific meetings, production of publications, and by providing sound independent scientific opinion.

The FBA hosts both published and unpublished collections, two specialist libraries and varieties of long term data sets from sites of scientific significance.It is managed by The Chief Executive, Dr Bill Brierley who is assisted by 25 staff (17 full-time equivalents).  A board of trustees, elected by the members, guide the strategic direction of the Association in line with the charitable objectives. The FBA is a [[registered charity]], number 214440 and a company limited by guarantee, registration number 263162, England.

==Activities==
The FBA is involved in many activities which include the support of Science through the use of its location in The Lake District in Cumbria and alongside the River Frome, East Stoke in Dorset and uses its location to support scientific work by providing specialist facilities and equipment.

The FBA is also involved in research through grants and studentships given to young scientists, and has made provisions for information services, from its freshwater libraries, to its information collection titled "FreshwaterLife", to its reference collection "The [[Felix Eugen Fritsch|Fritsch]] Collection".&lt;ref name="fritsch"&gt;[http://www.fritschalgae.info The Fritsch Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, many publications and analysis guides are also published by the FBA, with records of freshwater information.&lt;ref name="publications"&gt;[http://www.fba.org.uk/recorders FBA Recorders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920153721/http://www.fba.org.uk/recorders |date=2010-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBA also runs many meetings and courses for specialism in [[freshwater biology]], holding an Annual Scientific Meeting.

On September 2008 the FBA launched a series of conferences in [[Aquatic Biology]]. The first of these was entitled "Multiple Stressors in Freshwater Ecosystems".  The second, in April 2010, had the theme of "Integrated Catchment Management".

'''Fuzzy cold dark matter''' is a hypothetical form of [[cold dark matter]] proposed to solve the [[cuspy halo problem]]. It would consist of extremely light [[scalar particle]]s with masses on the order of &lt;math&gt;\approx 10^{-22}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;eV. Fuzzy cold dark matter halos in dwarf galaxies would manifest wave behavior on astrophysical scales, and the cusps would be avoided through the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cold and Fuzzy Dark Matter|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.1158|year=2000|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=85|issue=6|pages=1158–61|pmid=10991501|arxiv=astro-ph/0003365|last1=Hu|first1=Wayne|last2=Barkana|first2=Rennan|last3=Gruzinov|first3=Andrei|bibcode = 2000PhRvL..85.1158H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3668">In [[molecular biology]], '''gel extraction''' or '''gel isolation''' is a technique used to isolate a desired fragment of intact DNA from an [[agarose gel]] following [[agarose gel electrophoresis]].  After extraction, fragments of interest can be mixed, precipitated, and enzymatically ligated together in several simple steps. This process, usually performed on [[plasmids]], is the basis for rudimentary [[genetic engineering]].

After DNA samples are run on an agarose gel, extraction involves four basic steps: identifying the fragments of interest, isolating the corresponding bands, isolating the DNA from those bands, and removing the accompanying salts and stain.

To begin, [[UV light]] is shone on the gel in order to illuminate all the [[ethidium bromide]]-stained DNA.  Care must be taken to avoid exposing the DNA to mutagenic radiation for longer than absolutely necessary. The desired band is identified and physically removed with a [[cover slip]] or [[razor blade]].  The removed slice of gel should contain the desired DNA inside. An alternative method, utilizing SYBR Safe DNA gel stain and blue-light illumination, avoids the DNA damage associated with ethidium bromide and UV light.&lt;ref&gt;Quest: An Invitrogen Publication for Discovery Vol. 4, Issue 2, pp. 44–45 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Several strategies for isolating and cleaning the DNA fragment of interest exist.

==Spin Column Extraction==
Gel extraction kits are available from several major biotech manufacturers for a final cost of approximately 1–2 US$ per sample. 
Protocols included in these kits generally call for the dissolution of the gel-slice in 3 volumes of chaotropic agent at 50&amp;nbsp;°C, followed by application of the solution to a spin-column (the DNA remains in the column), a 70% ethanol wash (the DNA remains in the column, salt and impurities are washed out), and elution of the DNA in a small volume (30&amp;nbsp;µL) of water or buffer.&lt;ref&gt;Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit Instruction Manual. http://www.zymoresearch.com/zrc/pdf/D4001i.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialysis==
The gel fragment is placed in a [[dialysis (biochemistry)|dialysis tube]] that is permeable to fluids but impermeable to molecules at the size of DNA, thus preventing the DNA from passing through the membrane when soaked in [[TE buffer]]. An electric field is established around the tubing (in a way similar to gel electrophresis) long enough so that the DNA is removed from the gel but remains in the tube.  The tube solution can then be pipetted out and will contain the desired DNA with minimal background.

==Traditional==
The traditional method of gel extraction involves creating a folded pocket of Parafilm wax paper and placing the agarose fragment inside. The agarose is physically compressed with a finger into a corner of the pocket, partially liquifying the gel and its contents. The liquid droplets can then be directed out of the pocket onto an exterior piece of Parafilm, where they are pipetted into a small tube. A butanol extraction removes the ethidium bromide stain, followed by a phenol/chloroform extraction of the cleaned DNA fragment.

The disadvantage of gel isolation is that background can only be removed if it can be physically identified using the UV light.  If two bands are very close together, it can be hard to separate them without some contamination. In order to clearly identify the band of interest, further restriction digests may be necessary. Restriction sites unique to unwanted bands of similar size can aid in breaking up these potential contaminants.

'''Girls Who Code''' is a [[nonprofit organization]] which aims to support and increase the number of women in [[computer science]]. The organization is working to close the gender employment difference in technology and change the image of what a programmer looks like. They have a 7-week Summer Immersion Program, a 2-week specialized Campus Program, after school Clubs, and a 13-book [[The New York Times|New York Times]] best-selling series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2017/09/10/childrens-middle-grade-hardcover/|title=Children’s Middle Grade Hardcover Books - Best Sellers - September 10, 2017 - The New York Times|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is to inspire, educate, and equip young women with the computing skills to pursue 21st century opportunities.

* In boys, testicular enlargement is the first physical sign of gonadarche, and usually of [[puberty]].
* In girls, ovarian growth cannot be directly seen, so [[thelarche]] and growth acceleration are usually the first evidence of gonadarche.

Gonadarche should be contrasted with [[adrenarche]]. Gonadarche indicates that true central puberty has begun, while adrenarche is an independent maturational process only loosely associated with complete puberty.

'''Gross examination''' or "grossing" is the process by which [[pathology]] specimens are inspected with the bare eye to obtain [[diagnosis|diagnostic]] information, while being processed for further [[histopathology|microscopic]] ''examination.''

Gross examination of [[surgical pathology|surgical specimens]] is typically performed by a [[pathology|pathologist]], or by a [[pathologists' assistant]] working within a pathology practice. Individuals trained in these fields are often able to gather diagnostically critical information in this stage of processing, including the stage and margin status of surgically removed tumors.

The initial step in any examination of a clinical specimen is confirmation of the identity of the [[patient]] and the [[anatomy|anatomical]] site from which the specimen was obtained. Sufficient clinical data should be communicated by the clinical team to the pathology team in order to guide the appropriate diagnostic examination and interpretation of the specimen - if such information is not provided, it must be obtained by the examiner prior to processing the specimen.

There are usually two end products of the gross examination of a surgical specimen. The first is the gross description, a document which serves as the written record of the examiner's findings, and is included in the final pathology report. The second product is a set of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] blocks, typically postage stamp-sized portions of tissue sealed in plastic cassettes, which will be processed into slides for microscopic examination. Since only a minority of the tissue from a large specimen can reasonably be subject to microscopic examination, the success of the final [[histopathology|histological]] diagnosis is highly dependent on the skill of the professional performing the gross examination. The gross examiner may sample portions of the specimen for other types of ancillary tests as diagnostically indicated; these include [[microbiological culture]], [[flow cytometry]], [[cytogenetics]], or [[electron microscopy]].

'''Gustav Bergmann''' (May 4, 1906&amp;nbsp;– April 21, 1987) was an Austrian-born American philosopher. He studied at the [[University of Vienna]] and was a member of the [[Vienna Circle]]. Bergmann was influenced by the philosophers [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Friedrich Waismann]], and [[Rudolf Carnap]] who were members of the Circle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://clas.uiowa.edu/philosophy/resources/gustav-bergmann "Gustav Bergmann" (clas.uiowa.edu)]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], he was a professor of [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] at the [[University of Iowa]].

== Biography ==
Bergmann was born in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]]. He earned his Ph.D. in mathematics at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1928. His dissertation, directed by [[Walther Mayer]], was titled ''Zwei Beiträge zur mehrdimensionalen Differentialgeometrie''. While studying for his [[doctorate]], he was invited to join the [[Vienna Circle]], a group of philosophers, mathematicians, scientists, and others committed to a scientific worldview under the name of [[logical positivism]]. In 1930–31, he worked with [[Albert Einstein]] in Berlin. Unable as a Jew to find academic employment, Bergmann obtained a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from the University of Vienna in 1935, and practiced [[corporate law]] until he and his family fled to the United States in 1938. Settling at the [[University of Iowa]] in [[Iowa City]] in 1939, Bergmann eventually became professor of both philosophy and psychology.

He died in Iowa City.

==Cultural festival==

IISER Mohali's first cultural festival (Conoscenza) was held in 2012. Spread over three days, a Parliamentary Debate and numerous quizzes were the main events. A workshop on 'science writing' was also organised.

The next year, Conoscenza was replaced by a full-fledged cultural festival- Insomnia. Apart from parliamentary debate and quizzing, the availability of a large auditorium enabled the organisation of events related to music, dance and dramatics.

Insomnia is planned to be held every year; Insomnia 2014 was held between 4 and 6 April.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insomnia2014.com/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325102931/http://www.insomnia2014.com/ |date=25 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insomnia 2015 was held on 27–29 March 2015 and many many cultural, quizzing and gaming contests were the key features of the event and most importantly the theme of Insomnia 2015 was "GO GREEN".
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i-insomnia.net/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315161420/http://www.i-insomnia.net/ |date=15 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insomnia 2016 was held from 4–6 March 2016 and saw an attendance of participants and audience from colleges like ISB, IIT's, NIT's, Panjab University, PEC and lot more.&lt;ref&gt;http://insomniacx.in&lt;/ref&gt; Parikrama - The Band performed at the event to a huge crowd.

The past sponsors for INSOMNIA include brands like Hero, Mediacomm, Canara Bank, SBI etc.

Insomnia 2017 was held on 24–26 February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://insomniafest.xyz&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guthrie Govan]], Mohini Dey and Gino Banks performed on the night of 24 February 2017.

==National Science Day celebrations==
[[National Science Day]] celebrations on 28 February are a regular feature at IISER Mohali, every year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iisermohali.ac.in/scienceday2014/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629025012/http://iisermohali.ac.in/scienceday2014/index.html |date=29 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Invitations are sent to schools in  [[Mohali]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Panchkula]] and nearby areas. 
The focus of the day is on science and mathematics demonstrations prepared by IISER Mohali students and faculty members. A large number of schools send teams for inter-school competitions such as science quizzes, group discussions, treasure hunt, junkyard wars, poster presentation held on this day. Other non-competitive events such as documentary screening, anti-superstition demonstrations, atc. are also held. The day usually ends with a 'panel discussion' in which the school students ask science-related questions to a panel of faculty members of IISER Mohali. 
Since 2015, the Science Day celebrations have been shifted to 27 September, IISER Mohali's Foundation Day, as this date is more convenient for school students in the region.

==Opportunity Cell==
The Opportunity Cell was first proposed by the Student Representative Council, in October 2011 as a joint student-faculty
body to provide guidance to students about research and job opportunities. In the year 2012−13, the opportunity cell established a summer
research and internship programme with [[National Centre for Biological Sciences]] (NCBS), Bangalore, Connexios Life sciences &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connexios.com/ |title=Connexios Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd |website=Connexios.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lucid Software Limited (Lucid). It also organised various seminars such as 
"Alternative Careers in Science", "Research Opportunities at [[University of St Andrews]]" etc. Currently the cell disseminates information about
summer research programmes, PhD positions and research oriented jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iisermohali.ac.in/OppCell_f1-master/public/index.php/home |title=Home &amp;#124; Opportunity Cell |website=Iisermohali.ac.in |date= |accessdate=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magazine==
Two editions of IISER Mohali's magazine ("Manthan") have been published so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iisermmag.wordpress.com/ |title=iisermmag &amp;#124; eManthan: IISER Mohali Online Magazine |website=Iisermmag.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Instituto de Astronomía Teórica y Experimental''' (IATE) is a scientific institute funded by the [[Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas|Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones en Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET)]] and the [[Universidad Nacional de Córdoba|Universidad Nacional de Córdoba (UNC)]], located in the city of Córdoba, Argentina, and dedicated to the study of different topics in astronomy. The headquarters of the institute are located at the [[:es:Observatorio Astronómico de Córdoba|Observatorio Astronómico de Córdoba]].

== History ==
In the 1960s, [[:es:José Luis Sérsic|Dr. José Luis Sérsic]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fundacionkonex.com.ar/b1038-l-Jose%20Luis-Sersic&lt;/ref&gt; (argentinian scientist mainly known for his empirical law for the intensity of a galaxy called [[Sersic profile|Sersic's Law]])  created the extragalactic astronomy department at the [[:es:Observatorio Astronómico de Córdoba|Observatorio Astronómico de Córdoba]], where he developed his academic and research activities, forming his first disciples. In 1983, the department became the "Programa de Investigaciones en Astronomía Teórica y Experimental" (IATE), funded by [[CONICET]], under Dr. Sérsic direction. Following the death of Dr. Sérsic on July 19, 1993, the program was discontinued. However, those graduates and PhD who were trained under his tutelage were ordered to continue with the group IATE as research group within the Observatorio Astronómico, under the leadership of Dr. Diego Garcia Lambas, one of the main disciples of Dr. Sérsic. After more than 10 years of hard work forming graduates, PhD and researchers, and to become one of the most numerous research groups within the Observatorio Astronómico, the IATE group has become one of the institutes of [[CONICET]] in 2006, with Dr. Diego Garcia Lambas being its first director. The institute then took the name of Instituto de Astronomía Teórica y Experimental, retaining the acronym IATE.

== Scientific Areas ==
The lines of research are:

* Galactic and Extragalactic Astronomy
* Large Scale Structure of the Universe
* Planetary Systems
* Astrophysical Plasmas
* Instrumental Astronomy and Site Testing

=== Galactic and Extragalactic Astronomy ===
[[File:Seyfert Sextet cut out.jpg|170x170px|thumbnail|right|The Seyfert's Sextet]]
The 13.8 billion years of the Universe is enough time to form giant objects, being the galaxies one of the most interesting. Galaxies are truly island universes where dark matter, billions of stars and huge amounts of gas and dust coexist in equilibrium, and yet, they are an environment suitable for the formation of new stars. Galaxies also tend to cluster in a network of cosmic proportions which highlights fabulous large structures formed by thousands of galaxies.
At the IATE, the study of galaxies has been a constant challenge, which has allowed to consolidate over the years different methods for the study of the formation and evolution of galaxies. Some of the most important are:
* Numerical Simulations: the physical processes that govern the evolutionary history of one or many galaxies are recreated by using supercomputers:
* Statistical Studies: properties of galaxies are inferred and analysed from large data surveys;
* Astronomical Observations: classic observations and the most modern and sophisticated techniques are combined by using the telescope facilities around the world.

These and other tools are used by different scientists at the IATE to perform original and reliable astronomical research.

=== Large Scale Structure of the Universe ===
[[File:Large-scale structure formation.gif|thumbnail|right|Numerical simulation of a CDM universe with dark energy (Andrey Kravtsov and Anatoly Klypin)]]
The large-scale structure of the Universe is the field of cosmology that studies the distribution of the matter in the Universe on the largest scales. This field has grown remarkably since the '80s, with the development of three-dimensional maps of galaxies in several bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, and with the observation of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)]].
The increasing flow of information generated by observations has allowed to obtain reliable characterization of the content of the universe comprising
* 74% of [[Dark energy|vacuum or dark energy]],
* 26% [[dark matter]] and
* 4% [[Baryonic matter|ordinary baryonic matter]],
as well as its distribution.
The distribution of the structures seems to follow a hierarchical model where the upper level is dominated by a network of clusters and filaments. On top of that, the universe appears to be isotropic and homogeneous in accordance with the [[cosmological principle]].
From the analysis of catalogs and the development of numerical simulations, the distribution is characterized through the implementation of different statistics that allow the study of the spatial distribution as well as the dynamics by means of the velocity field of the matter distribution.

=== Planetary Systems ===
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|280x150px|thumbnail|left|Artist's concept of a protoplanetary disk.]]
The question of the existence of other worlds has been present in the history of mankind for centuries, but only recent scientific evidence has confirmed that planets could exist and are common outside the Solar System. Since the first discovery in 1992, over 850 new exoplanets have been cataloged.
Contrary to the Solar System, exoplanets' population presents several examples of exoplanets at very small distances from its stars, highly eccentric planetary orbits, and they are frequently found in configurations not previously imagined. This led to the development of new theories and areas of research, which ultimately can help us to better understand the Solar System.
Some of the projects that are currently being developed at the IATE include:
* Analyses of observational data for exoplanets (radial velocity and transit);
* Models of tidal interaction with the central star to study the origin of the population of "hot" exoplanets
* Study of the dynamics of extrasolar planets in mean motions resonances;
* Development of hydrodynamic codes to describe the interaction between planets and the protoplanetary disk;
* Analyses of the formation of planets in binary stellar systems.

=== Astrophysical Plasmas ===
[[File:EruptiveProminence.gif|170x170px|thumbnail|right|An eruptive prominence on the surface of the sun.]]
The plasma is the most common state of the baryonic matter in the Universe (99%). Most of a star, the interplanetary and interstellar medium, and the ionosphere, are plasmas. The plasma can also be generated in terrestrial laboratories for industrial applications such as producing surface coatings, precision cuts in lamps, micro-motors, and plasma reactors.
A plasma is a fluid consisting of a large number of free charged particles (globally neutral and whose kinetic energy is larger than the electrostatic potential energy between them). The charges and currents that conform a plasma are sources of the electromagnetic fields and, in turn, these fields affect the distribution of charges and currents which makes its dynamics highly nonlinear and very different from that of a neutral gas. When the magnetic fields are capable of modifying an individual particle trajectory, it is said that the plasma is magnetized. The corona is highly magnetized and therefore, several structures are observed, some of which can maintain its stability for relatively long times as dark filaments on the surface of the sun.
In the group of astrophysical plasmas, our scientist perform studies about the dynamic configuration and structures of the corona through the analysis of magnetic arcs and prominences, the formation of voids that remain in the plasma due to the interaction of nonlinear waves, the formation of very energetic shock wave capable of sweeping the chromosphere along a whole quadrant, etc. The team also analyse the interaction of stellar winds with the magnetosphere of exoplanets, and they model the morphology of supernova remnants affected by instabilities and the influence of the magnetic field.

=== Site Testing ===
The IATE also performs site testing for the installation of large astronomical facilities in the Argentinian territory.
During the 90's (1989-1998), the IATE began the first work on astronomical site testing performing seeing measurements in the Antarctic Base Belgrano II. In 1998, measurements of seeing were performed in the Llano de Chajnantor, Atacama (Chile), as part of a project aimed at installing a liquid mercury telescope in Toco volcano. This project was not successful but the group learnt the use of the most modern technologies for measuring sky parameters. Through this experience, the IATE made contact with Dr. Marc Sarazin, of the [[European Southern Observatory|European Southern Observatory (ESO)]], with whom, since the year 2000, the IATE began the searching and characterization of candidate sites to install the [[European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT)]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unc.edu.ar/seccion/novedades/2008/mayo/cientificos-de-la-unc-estudian-la-puna-saltena&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archivo.lavoz.com.ar/08/05/09/secciones/sociedad/nota.asp?nota_id=188054&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSJeKmqsmYs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlmHTEC8CGQ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeJ9m6vPRc4&lt;/ref&gt; which will be finally installed in Chile, at the Cerro Armazones. During that work, a suitable candidate site was preselected at the Cordón Macón, close to Tolar Grande town. Because of its excellent conditions, the IATE decided to install observational facilities at this site,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hoylauniversidad.unc.edu.ar/2012/junio/argentina-tendra-su-cuarto-observatorio&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://astronomiadecordoba.blogspot.com.ar/2010/08/el-instituto-de-astronomia-teorica-y.html&lt;/ref&gt; which is the most important project to date for the instrumentation team.
The project also involves the development of a program committed to the educational public outreach in astronomy at the town of Tolar Grande, named Ñawi Puna.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.secyt.unc.edu.ar/unc/boletin_contenido.php?idNota=271&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The New Astronomical Complex ====
[[File:Observatory at the Cordon Macon.jpg|thumbnail|right|The first observatory building at the Macón peak (May, 2012).]]
The IATE is building an astronomical complex on the Cordón Macón, located at 10&amp;nbsp;km from the town of [[Tolar Grande]], [[Salta]], Argentina. The site is located at latitude 24.61 South and longitude 67.32 West and at an altitude of 4,650 meters. The location has ideal conditions of humidity and air turbulence, which create almost perfect astronomical seeing. The site infrastructure will enable the development of several observational projects:

* The '''ABRAS''' project: The Argentina-Brasil Astronomical Center is a project involving both Latin-American countries. The main institutions behind the project are the IATE, from Argentina, and the [http://www.iag.usp.br/ IAG (Instituto de Astronomia, Geofísica e Ciencias Atmosféricas)], from Sao Paulo, Brasil, while the funding institutions are the [http://www.mincyt.gov.ar/ Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Productiva] and the [[University of Sao Paulo]] ([http://www5.usp.br/ Universidade de Sao Paulo, USP]). The project involves the installation of an astronomical observational facility in the Cordón Macón. The 1 meter telescope will be installed in an 8-meter diameter dome. The building and the installation of the dome was performed during 2011-2012, while the 1 meter telescope arrived to Córdoba (Argentina) during October 2015. One of the main goals of the project is to optimize the telescope for performing astronomical observations in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The first observations with this telescope is expected to be perform for the year 2016.
* The '''TOROS''' project: The Transient Optical Robotic Observatory of the South (TOROS) project is a collaboration among scientists from [[The University of Texas]] at Brownsville, the [[Universidad Nacional de Cordoba|Universidad Nacional de Cordoba (UNC)]], [[CALTECH]] and [[Texas A&amp;M University]]. The project intend to construct a dedicated optical follow-up instrument for Advanced [[LIGO]] (aLIGO) and Advanced Virgo ([[Virgo interferometer|AdVirgo]]) in order to surveying the sky for even very dim afterglows of gravitational waves events. The project also pursuit the aim of detecting nearby supernovas. The [http://toros.phys.utb.edu/TOROS/First_TOROS_Workshop.html first workshop] of the TOROS collaboration was held in the city of Salta, Argentina, in June, 2013.
* The '''ISON''' project: The International Scientific Optical Network (ISON) program is an international effort that intend to understand and catalogue the space debris population in the near-Earth space and of potentially hazardous [[Near-Earth object|Near Earth Objects (NEOs)]]. In order to contribute to this program, the [[Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics|Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics (KIAM)]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] (RAS), of the [[Russian Federation]], will work together with the [[Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales|Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE)]], the IATE, the [[Observatorio Astronómico de Córdoba|Observatorio Astronómico de Córdoba (OAC)]] and the Goberment of the [[:es:Provincia de Salta|Provincia de Salta]] in Argentina, to install and operate two small telescopes of 20 and 25&amp;nbsp;cm of diameter, that will be operated remotely via Internet connection. The aim of this cooperation is to perform observations of orbital debris, asteroids, comets and optical counterparts of gamma-ray bursts.

== FoF meetings ==
Yearly, the IATE organizes the astronomical meeting named "Friends-of-Friends", usually carried out during the first fortnight of April. The meeting is aimed at stretching the bounds between the astronomers that work at the IATE and their external collaborators, as well as sharing the state-of-the-art of works that are being developed by the IATE members.
The talks are split into two different modes: invited speakers present talks of 45+15 minutes, while there are several short talks of 15+5 minutes long.

The '''Invasive Species Forecasting System''', or simply '''ISFS''', is a modeling environment for creating predictive [[habitat suitability]] maps for [[invasive species]]. It was developed by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) in cooperation with various Department of Interior bureaus, including the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS), the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM), and the [[National Park Service]] (NPS).

'''The London School of Philosophy''' is an independent [[adult education]] college located in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. It offers part-time non-degree courses on a wide range of topics within [[philosophy]]. It was founded in 2010 by lecturers from Birkbeck College. It is based within [[Conway Hall]], in [[Bloomsbury]].

==History==

In 2009, the long-established School of Continuing Education at [[Birkbeck, University of London]], which specialised in [[extra-mural studies]], was abolished and its activities integrated into the main college. The following year, as part of this re-organisation, the number of part-time philosophy courses for adults was sharply reduced. Seven of Birkbeck's philosophy lecturers responded to the cancellation of their courses by meeting to establish a new college, the London School of Philosophy (LSP).&lt;ref name="LSP1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://londonschoolofphilosophy.org/ |title=Philosophy For the Capital |work=LSP website |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="ER1"&gt;{{cite |title=The London School of Philosophy at Conway Hall|work=Ethical Record (Vol.116 No.9, October 2011) |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LSP's seven founders organised themselves on a cooperative basis and agreed a constitution in 2010. The first lectures took place in January 2011. A launch event was held on 6 September 2011.&lt;ref name="LSP2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://londonschoolofphilosophy.org/?page_id=477 |title=Launch Event |work=LSP website |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
In 2011 the London School of Philosophy announced a collaborative agreement with [[Conway Hall]] to base all its teaching activities there.&lt;ref name="PN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophynow.org/issue86/News_September_October_2011 |title=London’s first adult education college devoted entirely to philosophy |work=Philosophy Now (September/October 2011) |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Conway Hall is a large [[art-deco]] building on Red Lion Square in [[Bloomsbury]], built in 1929. It is the venue for a wide range of concerts, lectures and other cultural events.&lt;ref name="CH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conwayhall.org.uk |title=Conway Hall |work=Conway Hall website |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building also houses the Humanist Library,&lt;ref name="HL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conwayhall.org.uk/our-library |title=Library |work=Conway Hall website |accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes a sizeable philosophy section.

==Courses==
Courses at the college cover topics such as ‘Philosophy and Theatre’, ‘Philosophy of Love’; ‘Existentialism’; and ‘Philosophy and Biology’ alongside others on ethics, aesthetics and the history of philosophy.

==Summer Schools==
In 2013 the London School of Philosophy for the first time entered a collaborative arrangement with [[Birkbeck,_University_of_London|Birkbeck]]'s Department of Philosophy and with Conway Hall, to offer a Summer School on philosophy, which was held over several days at the beginning of July.

The LSP's second annual Summer School, in 2014, was a collaboration with [[Heythrop College]] and Conway Hall. The speakers included Professor [[John Cottingham]], Professor [[Keith Ward]], Dr Anna Abram, Dr [[Piers Benn]], Dr [[Stephen Law]] and Dr Adam Stewart-Wallace (all from Heythrop), Dr Shahrar Ali, Dr Keith Barrett and Dr [[Anja Steinbauer]] (from London School of Philosophy) and special guest speakers Dr [[Roger Scruton]], Emeritus Professor [[Richard Norman]] (Kent) and Professor [[Ken Gemes]] (Birkbeck). &lt;ref name="LS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.londonschoolofphilosophy.org |title=LSP Summer School |work=LSP website |accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==
[[File:Bertrand Russell and Conway Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1801595.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Bertrand Russell]] in front of Conway Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1801595]]
As the London School of Philosophy offers only part-time courses, student life is not centralised. The college does not offer [[halls of residence]]. At lunchtimes, LSP students often gather at the open-air Park Café in Red Lion Square Gardens.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3549">The '''Medea hypothesis''' is a term coined by [[paleontologist]] [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ward (2009), ''The Medea Hypothesis: Is Life on Earth Ultimately Self-Destructive?'', {{ISBN|0-691-13075-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the anti-[[Gaia hypothesis|Gaian hypothesis]] that [[multicellular life]], understood as a [[superorganism]], is suicidal; in this view, microbial-triggered [[Extinction event|mass extinctions]] are attempts to return the Earth to the microbial-dominated state it has been for most of its history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227131.400-gaias-evil-twin-is-life-its-own-worst-enemy.html Gaia's evil twin: Is life its own worst enemy?] The New Scientist.

Past "suicide attempts" include:
*[[Methane poisoning]], 3.5 billion years ago
*The [[Great Oxygenation Event|oxygen catastrophe]], 2.45 billion years ago
*[[Snowball earth]], twice, [[Huronian glaciation|2.4-2.1 billion years ago]] and 790–630 million years ago
*At least five putative [[hydrogen sulfide]]-induced mass extinctions, such as the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Great Dying]], {{Ma|252.28}}

The list does not include the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]], since this was, at least partially, externally induced by a [[meteor impact]].

'''Media art history''' is an interdisciplinary field of research that explores the current developments as well as the history and genealogy of [[new media art]], [[digital art]], and [[electronic art]].&lt;ref&gt;Cubitt, Sean and Paul Thomas. eds. 2013. Relive: Media Art Histories. Cambridge/Mass.: MIT-Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grau, Oliver. ed. 2007. MediaArtHistories. Cambridge: MIT-Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frieling, Rudolf and Dieter Daniels. eds. 2004. Media Art Net 1: Survey of Media Art. New York/Vienna: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand, media art histories addresses the contemporary interplay of art, technology, and science.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Stephen. 2002. Information Arts. Intersections of Art, Science, and Technology Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Stephen. 2010. Art + Science Now. London: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Linda. 1983. The Fourth Dimension and Non - Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art . Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other, it aims to reveal the historical relationships and aspects of the ‘afterlife’ ([[Aby Warburg]]) in new media art by means of a historical comparative approach. This strand of research encompasses questions of the history of media and perception, of so-called archetypes,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;Grau, Oliver. 2003. Virtual Art: From Illusion to Immersion. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as those of [[iconography]] and the [[history of ideas]]. Moreover, one of the main agendas of media art histories is to point out the role of digital technologies for contemporary, post-industrial societies and to counteract the marginalization of according art practices and art objects: ″Digital technology has fundamentally changed the way art is made. Over the last forty years, media art has become a significant part of our networked information society. Although there are well-attended international festivals, collaborative research projects, exhibitions and database documentation resources, media art research is still marginal in universities, museums and archives. It remains largely under-resourced in our core cultural institutions.″&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediaarthistory.org/declaration&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[new media art]] itself is of great importance to the field.&lt;ref&gt;Rush, Michael. 2005. New Media in Art. London: Thames &amp; Hudson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tribe, Mark, Reena Jana and Uta Grosenick. 2006. New Media Art. Köln: Taschen.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shanken, Edward A. 2009. Art and Electronic Media. London: Phaidon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Christiane. 2003. Digital Art. New York: Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; New media art is an umbrella term that encompasses art forms that are produced, modified and transmitted by means of [[Digital technology|digital technologies]] or, in a broader sense, make use of ‘new’ and emerging technologies that originate from a scientific, military or industrial context. The majority of authors that try to ‘delineate’ the aesthetic object of new media art emphasize aspects of [[interactivity]], processuality, [[multimedia]], and [[real time (media)|real time]]. The focus of new media art lies in the cultural, political, and social implications as well as the aesthetic possibilities – more or less its ‘media-specificity’ – of digital media. Consequently, scholars recognize the function of media technologies in New Media Art not only as a ‘carrier’ of meaning, but instead as a means that fundamentally shapes the very meaning of the artwork itself.

Furthermore, the field of new media art is increasingly influenced by new technologies that surmount a traditional understanding of (art) media. This becomes apparent in regards to technologies that originate from the field of biotechnology and life science and that are employed in artistic practices such as bio art, genetic art, and transgenic art. Consequently, the term new media art does not imply a steady ‘genre’ of art production. Instead, it is a field that emphasizes new technologies (in order to establish an explicit difference with traditional art media and genres). The list of genres that are commonly subsumed under the label of new media art illustrates its broad scope and includes, among others, virtual art.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Frank. 2007.

== Resources and research projects ==

Since the end of the 1990s, the first online databases came into being, as exemplified by the university-based Archive of Digital Art,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalartarchive.at/nc/home.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rhizome&lt;ref&gt;http://rhizome.org/&lt;/ref&gt; platform located in New York, Netzspannung&lt;ref&gt;http://netzspannung.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (until 2005), the database project Compart&lt;ref&gt;http://dada.compart-bremen.de/&lt;/ref&gt; in which early phase of Digital Art is addressed, and the collaborative online platform Monoskop.&lt;ref&gt;http://monoskop.org/Monoskop&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of institutional resources, media art histories spans diverse organisations, archives, research centres as well as private initiatives. Already at this early stage in the development of the field, the actors of media art histories were connected by way of digital communication, especially by so-called mailing lists such as [[Nettime]] or Rohrpost, both channels of communication that remain prime resources for the new media art community.

In the last few years, there was a significant increase of festivals and conferences dedicated to new media art, though the dominant festivals in the field continue to be the [[Ars Electronica]], the [[Transmediale]], the [[Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts|ISEA]] (Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts), and [[SIGGRAPH]] (Special Interest Group on Graphics and Interactive Techniques). To this day, museums and research facilities specializing in New Media Art are the exception. Nevertheless, [[ZKM]] (Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie) or specific focuses in collections (including the [[Whitney Museum]], the [[New York Museum of Modern Art]], or the [[Walker Art Center]]) serve as important spaces for exchange. Beyond museums that reach a wider audience, there are more and more smaller museums and galleries that focus on new media art (such as the Berlin-based DAM – Digital Art Museum).  Additionally, archives in which are exhibited artifacts situated at the intersection of the histories of media, art, and technology are important resources, including collections such as that of Werner Nekes or those cabinets of wonder and curiosity incorporated in art history museums.

Even given this increase in festivals, however, a variety of significant research initiatives have been discontinued.  These include the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Media.Art.Research, the Daniel Langlois Foundation for Art, Science and Technology,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/&lt;/ref&gt; and Media Art Net.  This difficulty in establishing sustainable funding structures as well as support for access to shared data for the scientific research of new media art was made public and addressed by the [http://www.mediaarthistory.org/declaration Liverpool Declaration]. Scholars and artists based at institutions all over the globe signed the declaration in a call to develop systematic strategies to fulfill the task that digital culture and its research demands in the 21st Century.&lt;ref&gt;Signatories are, among others, Sean CUBITT, Goldsmith; Oliver GRAU, Danube U; Ross HARLEY, UNSW Sydney;  Christiane PAUL, New School, New York; Diana DOMINGUES, Universidade de Brasília; Horst BREDEKAMP, Humboldt-University Berlin; Barbara Maria STAFFORD, Georgia Tech; Frieder NAKE, University of Bremen; Peter WEIBEL, ZKM; Roy ASCOTT, University of Plymouth, Sir Nicholas SEROTA, Tate; Martin WARNKE, Leuphana University, Mike STUBBS, FACT Liverpool; Benjamin WEIL, LABORAL; Andreas BROECKMANN, Leuphana Arts Program; Jeffrey SHAW, City University Hong Kong; Eduardo KAC, Chicago Arts Institute; Christa SOMMERER, University of Art Linz; Alex ADRIAANSENS, Institute for the Unstable Media, Lanfranco ACETI, Sabanci U; Howard BESSER, NYU’s  Tisch School of the Arts, Ianina PRUDENKO, National Univ.

Already in the late 1990s it became clear, that media art research is spread over many disciplines and the need became urgent to give it common ground: Therefore, at Humboldt University Berlin Oliver Grau in Cooperation with Roger Malina, Leonardo and Sara Diamond, Banff Center developed the international Conference Series on the Histories of MediaArt, Science and Technology, which was started in 2005 through a collective process, involving more than 10 disciplines related to media art. The world conference series attempts to foster the exchange between these different disciplines and their various actors. To date, the conference took place six times with Re-fresh (Banff 2005), Re-place (Berlin 2007), Re-live (Melbourne 2009), Re-wire (Liverpool 2011), Re-new (Riga 2013), Re-create (Montreal 2015), upcoming Vienna/Krems ad Donau (2017). Documentation of the meanwhile more than 2000 papers and applications can be found on MediaArtHistory.org [http://www.mediaarthistory.org/]

== Focus of research ==

Several scholars in the field of media art history claim that there is still a considerable lack of knowledge regarding the origins of visual and audio-visual media.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Grau, Oliver. Introduction. In MediaArtHistories, edited by Oliver Grau, 1-14. Cambridge: MIT Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, it is the objective of media art histories to expand the historically informed knowledge of current media cultures with its developments and detours – the field is driven by the idea of a ‘deep time of the media’ (S. Zielinski).

Hence, scholars stress that the technological advances in current media cultures are best understood on the backdrop of an extensive media and art history. Contributions to this field are widespread and include, among others, researchers who have disciplinary focuses such as the history of science ([[Lorraine Daston]], Timothy Lenoir), art history and image science ([[Oliver Grau]], [[Barbara Stafford]], Dieter Daniels, Slavko Kacunko, [[Edward A. Shanken]], Gunalan Nadarajan, Linda Henderson, Andreas Broeckmann, [[Jonathan Crary]], [[Horst Bredekamp]], [[Peter Weibel]], [[Hans Belting]]), [[media studies]] and [[media archaeology]] ([[Friedrich Kittler]], [[Erkki Huhtamo]], [[Jussi Parikka]], [[ Wolfgang Ernst (media theorist)|Wolfgang Ernst]], [[Siegfried Zielinski]], Stephan Oettermann, [[Lev Manovich]]), [[sound studies]] ([[Douglas Kahn]]), [[film studies]] (Sean Cubitt, Ryszard Kluszczyński), as well as [[computer science]] ([[Frieder Nake]]).

The '''Melville Walker House''' is an inn on Maine Street in the [[Kennebunkport Historic District]] in [[Kennebunkport, Maine]]. The inn was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on May 6, 1976. It is now known as the Maine Stay Inn.

==History==

The Melville Walker House was built as a private residence in 1860 by merchant sea captain Melville Walker on land provided to him by his father, William H. Walker. Captain Walker transferred the title to his wife, Abbie, following their marriage.

The property then passed to brother-in-law, Hiram Fairfield on October 4, 1876, who in turn left it to his wife, Adelaide, (Melville's sister) and their son, Harry. 31 years later in 1891, the property passed from the founding family for the first time when Adelaide sold it to the Heuvelman family. The Heuvelmans held the property until 1899, at which time they sold it to George Little, an executive with the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad.&lt;ref&gt;Kennebunkport Historical Society, http://www.kporthistory.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The Society's records show that electric lights were installed in 1905 at the Little's on Maine Street, then known as “The Maples.”

Title to the house and property then passed to Senator Wickes of New York in 1924. The next owners, the Eldridge family, gave the property its current name “The Maine Stay” and opened their guest house. The first cottage was added to the property in 1954. The inn remained under the Eldridge ownership until 1970 when it was sold to the Taylor-Milligan family. They sold The Maine Stay to Max and Jane Andrews in 1976. Jacques and Carol Gagnon purchased the house in 1983 and turned it into a [[bed and breakfast]]. In April 1989, title passed to Carol and Lindsay Copeland who sold it to George and Janice Yankowski in 2002. On April 30, 2008 Janice and George sold the inn to Judi and Walter Hauer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mainestayinn.com/ Maine Stay Inn &amp; Cottages]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

The design of the main house is considered to be square block [[Italianate architecture]], contoured in a low-hip roof design, with additions and renovations added over the years.&lt;ref&gt;iLoveInns, http://www.iloveinns.com/maine-stay-inn-cottages-at-the-melville-walker-house-id8072.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1900s, [[Queen Anne style architecture]] was introduced to the inn with construction of the suspended spiral partially flying staircase, starburst crystal glass windows, ornately carved mantels and moldings, and additions of bay windows and the wrap-around porch.

[[Artificial life]] or virtual evolution attempts to understand evolutionary processes via the computer simulation of simple (artificial) life forms.

An unexpected [[emergent property]] of a [[complex system]] may be a result of the interplay of the cause-and-effect among simpler, integrated parts (see [[biological organisation]]).  Biological systems manifest many important examples of emergent properties in the complex interplay of components. Traditional study of biological systems requires reductive methods in which quantities of data are gathered by category, such as concentration over time in response to a certain stimulus. Computers are critical to analysis and modelling of these data. The goal is to create accurate real-time models of a system's response to environmental and internal stimuli, such as a model of a cancer cell in order to find weaknesses in its signalling pathways, or modelling of ion channel mutations to see effects on cardiomyocytes and in turn, the function of a beating heart.

==Standards==
By far the most widely accepted standard format for storing and exchanging models in the field is the [[Systems Biology Markup Language| Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)]]&lt;ref&gt;Klipp, Liebermeister, Helbig, Kowald and Schaber. (2007). "Systems biology standards—the community speaks" (2007), Nature Biotechnology 25(4):390–391.&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://sbml.org/ SBML.org] website includes a guide to many important software packages used in computational systems biology.  A large number of models encoded in SBML can be retrieved from [[BioModels]]. Other markup languages with different emphases include [[BioPAX]] and [[CellML]].

Creating a cellular model has been a particularly challenging task of [[systems biology]] and [[mathematical biology]]. It involves the use of [[computer simulation]]s of the many [[cell (biology)|cellular]] subsystems such as the [[metabolic network|networks of metabolites]] and [[enzyme]]s which comprise [[metabolism]], [[signal transduction]] pathways and [[gene regulatory network]]s to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes.

[[Membrane computing]] is the task of modelling specifically a [[cell membrane]].

===Multi-cellular organism simulation===
An open source simulation of C. elegans at the cellular level is being pursued by the [[OpenWorm]] community. So far the physics engine [https://github.com/openworm/OpenWorm/wiki/Geppetto--Overview Gepetto] has been built and models of the neural connectome and a muscle cell have been created in the NeuroML format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openworm.org/downloads.html OpenWorm Downloads&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protein folding===
{{Main|Protein folding problem}}
Protein structure prediction is the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a [[protein]] from its [[amino acid]] sequence—that is, the prediction of a protein's [[tertiary structure]] from its [[primary structure]].  It is one of the most important goals pursued by [[bioinformatics]] and [[theoretical chemistry]]. [[Protein structure prediction]] is of high importance in [[medicine]] (for example, in [[drug design]]) and [[biotechnology]] (for example, in the design of novel [[enzymes]]). Every two years, the performance of current methods is assessed in the [[CASP]] experiment.

===Human biological systems===

====Brain model====
The [[Blue Brain Project]] is an attempt to create a synthetic brain by [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineering]] the [[mammalian brain]] down to the molecular level. The aim of this project, founded in May 2005 by the Brain and Mind Institute of the ''[[Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|École Polytechnique]]'' in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, is to study the brain's architectural and functional principles. The project is headed by the Institute's director, Henry Markram. Using a [[Blue Gene]] [[supercomputer]] running Michael Hines's [[Neuron (software)|NEURON software]], the simulation does not consist simply of an [[artificial neural network]], but involves a partially biologically realistic model of [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref name="Brainsim"&gt;Graham-Rowe, Duncan. [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7470--mission-to-build-a-simulated-brain-begins.html "Mission to build a simulated brain begins"], ''NewScientist'', June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Jason. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8012496.stm Simulated brain closer to thought], BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt; It is hoped by its proponents that it will eventually shed light on the nature of [[consciousness]].
There are a number of sub-projects, including the [[Cajal Blue Brain]], coordinated by the [[Supercomputing and Visualization Center of Madrid]] (CeSViMa), and others run by universities and independent laboratories in the UK, U.S., and Israel. The Human Brain Project builds on the work of the Blue Brain Project.&lt;ref name="hbp_homepage"&gt;[http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/index.html The Human Brain Project.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705000755/http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/index.html |date=July 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hbp_video"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4a-Om-1MrQ Video of Henry Markram presenting The Human Brain Project on 22 June 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of six pilot projects in the Future Emerging Technologies Research Program of the European Commission,&lt;ref name="FET_flagships_homepage"&gt;[http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/programme/fet/flagship/home_en.html FET Flagships Initiative homepage.]&lt;/ref&gt; competing for a billion euro funding.

====Model of the immune system====
The last decade has seen the emergence of a growing number of simulations of the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/5qn66fvhu6cvlyvc/ Multi-criterion Evolutionary Algorithm with Model of the Immune System to Handle Constraints for Task Assignments - Springer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090518111729.htm|title=Computer Simulation Captures Immune Response To Flu|accessdate=2009-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Virtual liver====
The [[virtual liver network|Virtual Liver]] project is a 43 million euro research program funded by the German Government, made up of seventy research group distributed across Germany. The goal is to produce a virtual liver, a dynamic mathematical model that represents human liver [[mathematical physiology|physiology]], morphology and function.&lt;ref name="virtual liver"&gt;[http://www.virtual-liver.de/ Virtual Liver Network.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tree model===
{{Main|Simulated growth of plants}}
Electronic trees (e-trees) usually use [[L-system]]s to simulate growth. L-systems are very important in the field of [[complexity science]] and [[A-life]].
A universally accepted system for describing changes in plant morphology at the cellular or modular level has yet to be devised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds8-2/plantsim.html |title=Simulating plant growth |accessdate=2009-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209022645/http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds8-2/plantsim.html |archivedate=2009-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most widely implemented tree generating algorithms are described in the papers [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=218427 "Creation and Rendering of Realistic Trees"], and [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n0nacdyjpyvxnnef/ Real-Time Tree Rendering]

===Ecological models===
{{Main|Ecosystem model}}
Ecosystem models are [[mathematics|mathematical]] representations of [[ecosystem]]s.  Typically they simplify complex [[food web|foodwebs]] down to their major components or [[trophic level]]s, and quantify these as either numbers of [[organism]]s, [[biomass]] or the [[inventory]]/[[concentration]] of some pertinent [[chemical element]] (for instance, [[carbon]] or a [[nutrient]] [[chemical species|species]] such as [[nitrogen]] or [[phosphorus]]).

===Models in ecotoxicology===
The purpose of models in [[ecotoxicology]] is the understanding, simulation and prediction of effects caused by toxicants in the environment. Most current models describe effects on one of many different levels of biological organization (e.g. organisms or populations). A challenge is the development of models that predict effects across biological scales. [http://www.ecotoxmodels.org/ Ecotoxicology and models] discusses some types of ecotoxicological models and provides links to many others.

===Modelling of infectious disease===
{{Main|Mathematical modelling of infectious disease|Epidemic model}}
It is possible to model the progress of most infectious diseases mathematically to discover the likely outcome of an [[epidemic]] or to help manage them by [[vaccination]]. This field tries to find [[parameter]]s for various [[infectious disease]]s and to use those parameters to make useful calculations about the effects of a mass [[vaccination]] programme.

{{for|the scientific journal|Molecular Ecology}}
{{More citations needed|date=September 2014}}
'''Molecular ecology''' is a field of [[evolutionary biology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Charlesworth|first1=Brian|title=Measures of Divergence Between Populations and the Effect of Forces that Reduce Variability|url=http://www.filogeografia.dna.ac/PDFs/Charlesworth_B_98_Fst.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is concerned with applying molecular [[population genetics]], [[molecular phylogenetics]], and more recently [[genomics]] to traditional [[ecology|ecological]] questions (e.g., species diagnosis, conservation and assessment of biodiversity, species-area relationships, and many questions in behavioral ecology).  It is virtually synonymous with the field of "Ecological Genetics" as pioneered by [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], [[E. B. Ford]], [[Godfrey Hewitt|Godfrey M. Hewitt]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miglani |title=Essentials of Molecular Genetics |date=2015 |publisher=Alpha Science International Limited |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These fields are united in their attempt to study genetic-based questions "out in the field" as opposed to the laboratory. Molecular ecology is related to the field of [[Conservation genetics]].

Methods frequently include using [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellites]] to determine gene flow and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] between populations. The development of molecular ecology is also closely related to the use of [[microarray|DNA microarrays]], which allows for the simultaneous analysis of the expression of thousands of different genes. [[Quantitative PCR]] may also be used to analyze [[gene expression]] as a result of changes in environmental conditions or different response by differently adapted individuals.

==Bacterial diversity==
Molecular ecological techniques have recently been used to study ''in situ'' questions of bacterial diversity.  This stems from the fact that many [[microorganisms]] are not easily obtainable as cultured [[Strain (biology)|strains]] in the laboratory, which would allow for identification and characterisation. It also stems from the development of [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR technique]], which allows for rapid amplification of genetic material.

The amplification of [[DNA]] from environmental samples using general of group-specific [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]] leads to a mix of genetic material that has to be sorted out before sequencing and identification. The classic technique to achieve this is through cloning, which involves incorporating the amplified DNA fragments into bacterial [[plasmid]]s. Techniques such as [[temperature gradient gel electrophoresis]], allow for a faster result. More recently, the advent of relatively low-cost, next-generation DNA sequencing technologies, such as [[454 life sciences|454]] and [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] platforms, has allowed exploration of bacterial ecology in relation to continental-scale environmental gradients such as pH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lauber |first1=Christian L. |last2=Hamady |first2=Micah |last3=Knight |first3=Rob |last4=Fierer |first4=Noah |date=2009 |title=Pyrosequencing-based assessment of soil pH as a predictor of soil bacterial community structure at the continental scale |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=75 |issue=15 |pages=5111–5120 |doi=10.1128/AEM.00335-09 |pmc=2725504 |pmid=19502440}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was not feasible with traditional technology.

==Fungal diversity==

Exploration of fungal diversity ''in situ'' has also benefited from next-generation DNA sequencing technologies. The use of high-throughput sequencing techniques has been widely adopted by the fungal [[ecology]] community since the first publication of their use in the field in 2009.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Větrovský |first1=Tomáš |last2=Baldrian |first2=Petr |date=2013 |title=Analysis of soil fungal communities by amplicon pyrosequencing: current approaches to data analysis and the introduction of the pipeline SEED |journal=Biology and Fertility of Soils |volume=49 |issue=8 |pages=1027–1037 |doi=10.1007/s00374-013-0801-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to exploration of bacterial diversity, these techniques have allowed high-resolution studies of fundamental questions in fungal ecology such as [[phylogeography]],&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amend | first1 = AS | last2 = Seifert | first2 = KA | last3 = Samson | first3 = R | last4 = Bruns | first4 = TD | year = 2010 | title = Indoor fungal composition is geographically patterned and more diverse in temperate zones than in the tropics | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 107 | issue = 31| pages = 13748–13753 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1000454107 | pmid=20616017 | pmc=2922287}}&lt;/ref&gt; fungal diversity in forest soils,&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buéé | first1 = M | last2 = Reich | first2 = M | last3 = Murat | first3 = C | last4 = Morin | first4 = E | last5 = Nilsson | first5 = RH | last6 = Uroz | first6 = S | last7 = Martin | first7 = F | year = 2009 | title = 454 Pyrosequencing analyses of forest soils reveal an unexpectedly high fungal diversity | url = | journal = New Phytol | volume = 184 | issue = 2| pages = 449–456 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.03003.x| pmid = 19703112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; stratification of fungal communities in soil horizons,&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldrian | first1 = P | last2 = Kolarik | first2 = M | last3 = Stursova | first3 = M | last4 = Kopecky | first4 = J | last5 = Valaskova | first5 = V | last6 = Vetrovsky | first6 = T | display-authors = 6 | last7 = et al | year = 2012 | title = Active and total microbial communities in forest soil are largely different and highly stratified during decomposition | url = | journal = ISME J | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 248–258 | doi=10.1038/ismej.2011.95| pmid = 21776033 | pmc = 3260513 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fungal [[Ecological succession|succession]] on decomposing plant litter.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Voříšková | first1 = J | last2 = Baldrian | first2 = P | year = 2013 | title = Fungal community on decomposing leaf litter undergoes rapid successional changes | url = | journal = ISME J | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 477–486 | doi=10.1038/ismej.2012.116| pmid = 23051693 | pmc = 3578564 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of fungal ecology research leveraging next-generation sequencing approaches involves sequencing of [[PCR]] [[amplicons]] of conserved regions of DNA (i.e. marker genes) to identify and describe the distribution of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic groups]] in the fungal community in question, though more recent research has focused on sequencing functional gene [[amplicons]]&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; (e.g. Baldrian et al. 2012&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;). The locus of choice for description of the taxonomic structure of fungal communities has traditionally been the [[internal transcribed spacer]] (ITS) region of [[ribosomal RNA]] genes &lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seifert | first1 = KA | year = 2009 | title = Progress towards DNA barcoding of fungi | url = | journal = Mol Ecol Resour | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 83–89 | doi=10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02635.x| pmid = 21564968 }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its utility in identifying fungi to genus or species taxonomic levels,&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horton | first1 = TR | last2 = Bruns | first2 = TD | year = 2001 | title = The molecular revolution in ectomycorrhizal ecology: peeking into the black-box | url = | journal = Molecular Ecology | volume = 10 | issue = 8| pages = 1855–1871 | doi=10.1046/j.0962-1083.2001.01333.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its high representation in public sequence databases.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; A second widely used locus (e.g. Amend et al. 2010,&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Weber et al. 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weber |first1=Carolyn.

== Extra-pair fertilizations ==
In recent years, molecular data and analyses have been able to supplement traditional approaches of [[behavioral ecology]], the study of animal behavior in relation to its ecology and evolutionary history. One behavior that molecular data has helped scientists better understand is extra-pair fertilizations (EPFs), also known as [[Extra-pair copulation|extra-pair copulations (EPCs)]]. These are mating events that occur outside of a social bond, like monogamy and are hard to observe. Molecular data has been key to understanding the prevalence of and the individuals participating in EPFs.

While most bird species are socially monogamous, molecular data has revealed that less than 25% of these species are genetically monogamous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Griffith|first=Simon C.|last2=Owens|first2=Ian P.

Without molecular ecology, identifying individuals that participate in EPFs and the offspring that result from EPFs would be impossible.

== Isolation by distance ==
[[Isolation by distance]] (IBD), like reproductive isolation, is the effect of physical barriers to populations that limit migration and lower gene flow.  The shorter the distance between populations the more likely individuals are to disperse and mate and thus, increase gene flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = Sewall | year = 1943 | title = Isolation by Distance | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 114–138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of molecular data, specifically allele frequencies of individuals among populations in relation to their geographic distance help to explain concepts such as, sex-biased [[Inbreeding avoidance|dispersal]], [[speciation]], and landscape genetics.

The [[Mantel test]] is an assessment that compares genetic distance with geographic distance and is most appropriate because it doesn't assume that the comparisons are independent of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular Ecology|last=Freeland|first=Joanna|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-0-470-74833-6|location=|pages=135|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are three main factors that influence the chances of finding a correlation of IBD, which include sample size, metabolism, and taxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jenkins | first1 = D. G. | last2 = Carey | first2 = M. | last3 = Czerniewska | first3 = J. | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 2010 | title = A meta-analysis of isolation by distance: relic or reference standard for landscape genetics? | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06285.x | journal = Ecography | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 315–320 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, based on the meta-analysis, ectotherms are more likely than endotherms to display greater IBD.

== Metapopulation theory ==

[[Metapopulation]] theory dictates that a metapopulation consists of spatially distinct populations that interact with one another on some level and move through a cycle of extinctions and recolonizations (i.e. through dispersal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levins | first1 = R | year = 1969 | title = Some demographic and genetic consequences of environmental heterogeneity for biological control | url = | journal = Bulletin of the Entomological Society of America | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 237–240 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common metapopulation model is the extinction-recolonization model which explains systems in which spatially distinct populations undergo [[stochastic]] changes in population sizes which may lead to extinction at the population level. Once this has occurred, dispersing individuals from other populations will immigrate and "rescue" the population at that site. Other metapopulation models include the source-sink model (island-mainland model) where one (or multiple) large central population(s) produces disperses to smaller satellite populations that have a population growth rate of less than one and could not persist without the influx from the main population.

Metapopulation structure and the repeated extinctions and recolonizations can significantly affect a population's genetic structure. Recolonization by a few dispersers leads to [[population bottlenecks]] which will reduce the [[effective population size]] (Ne), accelerate [[genetic drift]], and deplete genetic variation. However, dispersal between populations in the metapopulation can reverse or halt these processes over the long term. Therefore, in order for individual sub-populations to remain healthy, they must either have a large population size or have a relatively high rate of dispersal with other subpopulations. Molecular ecology focuses on using tests to determine the rates of dispersal between populations and can use [[molecular clocks]] to determine when historic bottlenecks occurred. As habitat becomes more fragmented, dispersal between populations will become increasingly rare. Therefore, subpopulations that may have historically been preserved by a metapopulation structure may start to decline. Using mitochondrial or nuclear markers to monitor dispersal coupled with population Fst values and allelic richness can provide insight into how well a population is performing and how it will perform into the future.

==Molecular clocks==
The molecular clock hypothesis states that DNA sequences roughly evolve at the same rate and because of this the dissimilarity between two sequences can be used to tell how long ago they diverged from one another. The first step in of using a molecular clock is it must be calibrated based on the approximate time the two lineages being study diverged. The sources usually used to calibrate the molecular clocks are fossils or known geological events in the past. After calibrating the clock the next step is to calculate divergence time by dividing the estimated time since the sequences diverged by the amount of sequence divergence. The resulting number is the estimated rate at which molecular evolution is occurring. The most widely cited molecular clock is a ‘universal’ mtDNA clock of approximately 2 per cent sequence divergence every million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = W. M. | last2 = Prager | first2 = E. M. | last3 = Wang | first3 = A. | last4 = Wilson | first4 = A.

Another drawback to using molecular clocks is that they ideally need to be calibrated from an independent source of data other than the molecular data. This poses a big problem for taxa that don’t fossilize or preserve well because its almost impossible to calibrate their molecular clocks. Despite these inconveniences, the molecular clock hypothesis is still used today, and has been successful in dating events happening as long ago as 65 million years such as the emergence of ancestral mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kumar | first1 = S. | last2 = Hedges | first2 = S. B. | year = 1998 | title = A molecular timescale for vertebrate evolution | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 392 | issue = | pages = 917–920 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mate choice hypotheses ==
The concept of [[mate choice]] explains how organisms select their mates based on two main methods; The Good Genes Hypothesis and Genetic Compatibility. 
The Good Genes Hypothesis, also referred to as the [[sexy son hypothesis]], suggests that the females will choose a male that produce an offspring that will have increased fitness advantages and [[genetic viability]]. Therefore, the mates that are more 'attractive" are more likely to be chosen for mating and pass on their genes to the next generation. In species which exhibit [[polyandry]] the females will search out for the most suitable males and re-mate until they have found the best sperm to fertilize their eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yasui |first1=Yukio |date=March 1997 |title=A "Good-Sperm" model can explain the evolution of costly multiple mating by females |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=149 |issue=3 |pages=573–584 |doi=10.1086/286006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Genetic compatibility is where mates are choosing their partner based on the compatibility of their genotypes. The mate which is doing the selecting must know their own genotype as well as the genotypes of potential mates in order to select the appropriate partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Puurtinen |first1=Mikael |last2=Ketola |first2=Tarmo |last3=Kotiaho |first3=Janne S. |date=April 2005 |title=Genetic compatibility and sexual selection |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=157–158 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.02.005 |pmid=16701361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic compatibility in most instances is limited to specific traits, such as the [[major histocompatibility complex]] in mammals, because of complex genetic interactions. This behavior is potentially seen in humans. A study looking at women's choice in men based on body odors concluded that the scent of the odors were influenced by the MHC and that they influence mate choice in human populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wedekind |first1=Claus |last2=Seebeck |first2=Thomas |last3=Bettens |first3=Florence |last4=Paeke |first4=Alexander J. |date=1995 |title=MHC-dependent mate preferences in humans |journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences |volume=260 |issue=1359 |pages=245–249 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1995.0087 |issn=0962-8452 |pmid=7630893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sex-Biased Dispersal ==
Sex-biased dispersal, or the tendency of one sex to disperse between populations more frequently than the other, is a common behavior studied by researchers. Three major hypotheses currently exist to help explain sex-biased dispersal. The resource-competition hypothesis infers that the more philopatric sex (the sex more likely to remain at its natal grounds) benefits during reproduction simply by having familiarity with natal ground resources. A second proposal for sex-biased dispersal is the local mate competition hypothesis, which introduces the idea that individuals encounter less mate competition with relatives the farther from their natal grounds they disperse. And the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis suggests individuals disperse to decrease inbreeding.

Studying these hypotheses can be arduous since it is nearly impossible to keep track of every individual and their whereabouts within and between populations. To combat this time-consuming method, scientists have recruited several molecular ecology techniques in order to study sex-biased dispersal. One method is the comparison of differences between nuclear and mitochondrial markers among populations. Markers showing higher levels of differentiation indicate the more philopatric sex; that is, the more a sex remains at natal grounds, the more their markers will take on a unique I.D, due to lack of gene flow with respect to that marker. Researchers can also quantify male-male and female-female pair relatedness within populations to understand which sex is more likely to disperse. Pairs with values consistently lower in one sex indicate the dispersing sex. This is because there is more gene flow in the dispersing sex and their markers are less similar than individuals of the same sex in the same population, which produces a low relatedness value. FST values are also used to understand dispersing behaviors by calculating an FST value for each sex. The sex that disperses more displays a lower FST value, which measures levels of inbreeding between the subpopulation and the total population. Additionally, assignment tests can be utilized to quantify the number of individuals of a certain sex dispersing to other populations. A more mathematical approach to quantifying sex-biased dispersal on the molecular level is the use of spatial autocorrelation. This correlation analyzes the relationship between geographic distance and spatial distance. A correlation coefficient, or r value, is calculated and the plot of r against distance provides an indication of individuals more related to or less related to one another than expected.&lt;ref&gt;Freeland, Joanna; Kirk, Heather; Petersen, Stephen (2011).

== Quantitative trait loci ==
A [[quantitative trait locus]] (QTL) refers to a suite of genes that controls a quantitative trait. A quantitative trait is one that is influenced by several different genes as opposed to just one or two.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular Ecology|last=Freeland|first=Joanna|last2=Kirk|first2=Heather|last3=Peterson|first3=Stephen|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.|year=2011|isbn=978-1-119-99308-7|location=West Sussex, UK|pages=169–172|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; QTLs are analyzed using Qst. Qst looks at the relatedness of the traits in focus. In the case of QTLs, clines are analyzed by Qst. A [[cline (biology)]] is a change in allele frequency across a geographical distance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This change in allele frequency causes a series of intermediate varying phenotypes that when associated with certain environmental conditions can indicate selection. This selection causes local adaptation, but high gene flow is still expected to be present along the cline.

For example, barn owls in Europe exhibit a cline in reference to their plumage coloration. Their feathers range in coloration from white to reddish-brown across the geological range of the southwest to the northeast.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Antoniazza|first=Sylvain|last2=Burri|first2=Reto|last3=Fumagalli|first3=Luca|last4=Goudet|first4=Jérôme|last5=Roulin|first5=Alexandre|date=2010-07-01|title=Local adaptation maintains clinal variation in melanin-based coloration of European barn owls (Tyto alba)|journal=Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution|volume=64|issue=7|pages=1944–1954|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.00969.x|issn=1558-5646|pmid=20148951}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study sought to find if this phenotypic variation was due to selection by calculating the Qst values across the owl populations. Because high gene flow was still anticipated along this cline, selection was only expected to act upon the QTLs that incur locally adaptive phenotypic traits. This can be determined by comparing the Qst values to Fst ([[fixation index]]) values. If both of these values are similar and Fst is based on neutral markers then it can be assumed that the QTLs were based on neutral markers (markers not under selection or locally adapted) as well. However, in the case of the barn owls the Qst value was much higher than the Fst value. This means that high gene flow was present allowing the neutral markers to be similar, indicated by the low Fst value. But, local adaptation due to selection was present as well, in the form of varying plumage coloration since the Qst value was high, indicating differences in these non-neutral loci.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In other words, this cline of plumage coloration has some sort of adaptive value to the birds.

== Fixation indices ==
[[Fixation indices]] are used when determining the level of genetic differentiation between sub-populations within a total population. F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; is the script used to represent this index when using the formula:
: &lt;math&gt; F_{ST} = \frac{ H_{T} - H_{S} } { H_{T} } &lt;/math&gt;
In this equation, H&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; represents the expected [[heterozygosity]] of the total population and H&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is the expected heterozygosity of a sub-populations. Both measures of heterozygosity are measured at one loci. In the equation, heterozygosity values expected from the total population are compared to observed heterozygosity values of the sub-populations within this total population. Larger F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; values imply that the level of genetic differentiation between sub-populations within a total population is more significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Freeland |first1=Joanna R. |last2=Kirk |first2=Heather |last3=Petersen |first3=Stephen D. |title=Molecular ecology |date=2011 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell (an imprint of John Wiley &amp; Sons) |location=Chicester |isbn=978-0-470-74833-6 |pages=131–135 |edition=2nd rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of differentiation is the result of a balance between [[gene flow]] amongst sub-populations (decreasing differentiation) and [[genetic drift]] within these sub-populations (increasing differentiation); however, some molecular ecologists note that it cannot be assumed that these factors are at equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Woiwood |first1=Ian |last2=Reynolds |first2=D.

In these cases, higher F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; values typically imply higher amounts of inbreeding within the sub-populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Inbreeding and Population Structure |url=http://www.uvm.edu/~dstratto/bcor102/readings/inbreeding.pdf |publisher=University of Vermont}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors such as selection pressures may also affect F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hu |first1=Xin-Sheng |last2=He |first2=Fangliang |title=Background selection and population differentiation |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |url=https://sites.ualberta.ca/~fhe/He-publications/Hu_He.JTB05.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.01.004 |pmid=15862590 |volume=235 |issue=2 |year=2005 |pages=207–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inbreeding depression ==
[[Inbreeding depression]] is the reduced fitness and survival of offspring from closely related parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Charlesworth|first1=Deborah|last2=Willis|first2=John|title=The genetics of inbreeding depression|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=November 2009|volume=10|issue=11|pages=783–796|doi=10.1038/nrg2664|url=http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v10/n11/full/nrg2664.html|accessdate=2016-12-12|pmid=19834483}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inbreeding is commonly seen in small populations because of the greater chance of mating with a relative due to limited [[mate choice]]. Inbreeding, especially in small populations, is more likely to result in higher rates of [[genetic drift]], which leads to higher rates of homozygosity at all loci in the population and decreased [[heterozygosity]]. The rate of inbreeding is based on decreased heterozygosity. In other words, the rate at which heterozygosity is lost from a population due to genetic drift is equal to the rate of accumulating inbreeding in a population. In the absence of migration, inbreeding will accumulate at a rate that is inversely proportional to the size of the population.

There are two ways in which inbreeding depression can occur. The first of these is through '''dominance''', where beneficial alleles are usually dominant and harmful alleles are usually recessive. The increased homozygosity resulting from inbreeding means that harmful alleles are more likely to be expressed as homozygotes, and the deleterious effects cannot be masked by the beneficial dominant allele. 
The second method through which inbreeding depression occurs is through [[overdominance]], or heterozygote advantage. Individuals that are heterozygous at a particular locus have a higher fitness than homozygotes at that locus. Inbreeding leads to decreased heterozygosity, and therefore decreased fitness.

Deleterious alleles can be scrubbed by natural selection from inbred populations through [[genetic purging]]. As homozygosity increases, less fit individuals will be selected against and thus those harmful alleles will be lost from the population.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freeland|first1=Joanna|last2=Kirk|first2=Heather|last3=Peterson|first3=Stephen|title=Molecular Ecology|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=John Wiley &amp; Son Ltd, The Atrium, Southern Gate, Chichester, West Sussex, PO19 8SQ, UK|isbn=978-0-470-74834-3|pages=337–341|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outbreeding depression ==
Outbreeding depression is the reduced biological fitness in the offspring of distantly related parents. The decline in fitness due to outbreeding is attributed to a breakup of coadapted gene complexes or favorable epistatic relationships.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynch | first1 = Michael | year = 1991| title = The genetic interpretation of inbreeding depression and outbreeding depression | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 1991 | issue = 3| pages = 622–629 | doi=10.2307/2409915| jstor = 2409915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[inbreeding depression]], outbreeding depression places emphasis on interactions between loci rather than within them.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Risks of outbreeding depression increase with increased distance between populations. If outbreeding is limited and the population is large enough selective pressure acting on each generation may be able to restore fitness. Selection acts on out bred generations using increased diversity to adapt to the environment. This may result in greater fitness among offspring than the original parental type.

== Conservation units ==
Conservation units are classifications often used in [[conservation biology]], [[conservation genetics]], and molecular ecology in order to separate and group different species or populations based on genetic variance and significance for protection.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular Ecology|last=Freeland|first=Joanna|last2=Kirk|first2=Heather|last3=Petersen|first3=Stephen|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=978-0-470-74833-6|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|pages=332–333|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the most common types of conservation units are:
* Management Units (MU): Management units are populations that have very low levels of [[gene flow]] and can therefore be genetically differentiated from other populations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  
* [[Evolutionarily significant unit]]s (ESU): Evolutionarily significant units are populations that show enough genetic differentiation to warrant their management as distinct units.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
Conservation units are often identified using both neutral and non-neutral genetic markers, with each having its own advantages. Using neutral markers during unit identification can provide unbiased assumptions of [[genetic drift]] and time since reproductive isolation within and among species and populations, while using non-neutral markers can provide more accurate estimations of adaptive evolutionary divergence, which can help determine the potential for a conservation unit to adapt within a certain habitat.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Because of conservation units, populations and species that have high or differing levels of genetic variation are can be distinguished in order to manage each individually, which can ultimately differ based on a number of factors. In one instance, [[Atlantic salmon]] located within the [[Bay of Fundy]] were given evolutionary significance based on the differences in genetic sequences found among different populations.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vandersteen Tymchuk|first=Wendy|last2=O’reilly|first2=Patrick|last3=Bittman|first3=Jesse|last4=Macdonald|first4=Danielle|last5=Schulte|first5=Patricia|date=2010-05-01|title=Conservation genomics of Atlantic salmon: variation in gene expression between and within regions of the Bay of Fundy|journal=Molecular Ecology|language=en|volume=19|issue=9|pages=1842–1859|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04596.x|pmid=20529070|issn=1365-294X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This detection of evolutionary significance can allow each population of salmon to receive customized conservation and protection based on their adaptive uniqueness in response to geographic location.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Phylogenies ==
Phylogenies are the evolutionary history of an organism, also known as [[Phylogeography]]. A [[Phylogenetic tree]] is a tree that shows evolutionary relationships between different species based on similarities/differences among genetic or physical traits. Phylogenies embrace aspects of both time (evolutionary relationships) and space (geographic distribution).&lt;ref name="Freeland, Joanna 2011"&gt;Freeland, Joanna, Stephen Petersen, and Heather Kirk. Molecular Ecology. 2nd ed. Chichester, West Sussex, UK: Wiley-Blackwell, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically phylogeny trees include tips, which represent groups of descendent species, and nodes, which represent the common ancestors of those descendants. If two descendants split from the same node, they are called [[Sister groups]]. They also may include an [[outgroup (cladistics)|outgroup]], a species outside of the group of interest.&lt;ref&gt;		"Reading trees: A quick review" Understanding Evolution. University of California Museum of Paleontology. 22 August 2008 &lt;http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/news/060101_batsars&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The trees depict [[clades]], which is a group of organisms that include an ancestor and all descendants of that ancestor. The [[maximum parsimony]] tree is the simplest tree that has the minimum number of steps possible.

Phylogenies confer important historical processes that shape current distributions of genes and species.&lt;ref name="Freeland, Joanna 2011"/&gt; When two species become isolated from each other they retain some of the same ancestral alleles also known as allele sharing. Alleles can be shared because of lineage sorting and hybridization. Lineage sorting is driven by genetic drift  and must occur before alleles become species specific. Some of these alleles over time will simply be lost, or they may proliferate. Hybridization leads to [[introgression]] of alleles from one species to another.

== Species concepts ==
Species concepts are the subject of debate in the field of molecular ecology. Since the beginning of taxonomy, scientists have wanted to standardize and perfect the way species are defined. There are many species concepts that dictate how ecologists determine a good species. The most commonly used concept is the [[biological species concept]] which defines a species as groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups (Mayr, 1942).&lt;ref name="Freeland, Joanna 2011" /&gt; This concept is not always useful, particularly when it comes to hybrids. Other species concepts include phylogenetic species concept which describes a species as the smallest identifiable monophyletic group of organisms within which there is a parental pattern of ancestry and descent.&lt;ref name="Freeland, Joanna 2011" /&gt; This concept defines species on the identifiable. It would also suggest that until two identifiable groups actually produce offspring, they remain separate species. In 1999, John Avise and Glenn Johns suggested a standardized method for defining species based on past speciation and measuring biological classifications as time dependent. Their method used temporal banding to make genus, family and order based on how many tens of millions of years ago the speciation event that resulted in each species took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Avise |first=John |last2=Johns |first2=Glenn |year=1999 |title=Proposal for a standardized temporal scheme of biological classification for extant species |journal=Evolution |volume=96 |issue=13 |pages=7358–7363 |pmc=22090 |pmid=10377419 |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.13.7358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Landscape Genetics ==
Landscape genetics is a rapidly emerging interdisciplinary field within molecular ecology. Landscape genetics relates genetics to landscape characteristics, such as land-cover use (forests, agriculture, roads, etc.), presence of barriers and corridors, rivers, elevation, etc. Landscape genetics is used to answer how landscape affects dispersal and gene flow.

Barriers are any landscape features that prevents dispersal.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Barriers for terrestrial species can include mountains, rivers, roads, and unsuitable terrain, such as agriculture fields. Barriers for aquatic species can include islands or dams. Barriers are species specific; for example a river is a barrier to a field mouse, while a hawk can fly over a river. Corridors are areas over which dispersal is possible.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Corridors are stretches of suitable habitat and can also be man-made, such as overpasses over roads and fish ladders on dams.

Geographic data used for landscape genetics can include data collected by radars in planes, land satellite data, marine data collected by NOAA, as well as any other ecological data. In landscape genetics researchers often use different analyses to attempt to determine the best way for a species to travel from point A to point B. Least cost path analysis uses geographic data to determine the most efficient path from one point to another.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Circuit scape analysis predicts all the possible paths and the probability of each path's use between point A and point B. These analyses are used to determine the route a dispersing individual is likely to travel.

Landscape genetics is becoming an increasingly important tool in wildlife conservation efforts. It is being used to determine how habitat loss and fragmentation affects the movement of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holderegger|first=Rolf|last2=Wagner|first2=Helene H.|date=2008-03-01|title=Landscape Genetics|url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/58/3/199|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=58|issue=3|pages=199–207|doi=10.1641/B580306|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to determine which species need to be managed and whether to manage subpopulations the same or differently according to their gene flow.

'''Murray's law''' predicts the thickness of branches in transport networks, such that the cost for transport and maintenance of the transport medium is minimized. This law is observed in the [[vascular]] and [[respiratory systems]] of animals, [[xylem]] in plants, and the respiratory system of insects.&lt;ref name="Zheng2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sherman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sherman|first=Thomas F.|year=1981|title=On connecting large vessels to small.

Like [[Hagen-Poiseuille Law]] and [[Fick's Law]], which were also formulated from a biological context, Murray’s law is a basic physical principle for transfer networks.&lt;ref name="sherman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mcculloh" /&gt;

Murray's law is also a powerful [[biomimetics]] design tool in engineering. It has been applied in the design of [[self-healing material]]s, [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[photocatalysts]], and [[gas sensors]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} However, since its discovery, little attention has been paid to exploit this law for designing advanced materials, reactors and industrial processes for maximizing mass or energy transfer to improve material performance and process efficiency.&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt;

The original version of Murray's law is only applicable to [[Conservation of mass|mass-conservative]] transport in the network. There are generalizations for non-conservative networks, which describe effects such as chemical reactions and diffusion through the walls.&lt;ref name="Zheng2017"&gt;{{Cite journal

== Murray's law in mass-conservative networks ==

Murray's original analysis&lt;ref name="murray1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=Cecil D.|year=1926|title=The Physiological Principle of Minimum Work: I. The Vascular System and the Cost of Blood Volume|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=12|issue=3|pages=207–214|doi=10.1073/pnas.12.3.207|pmc=1084489|pmid=16576980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="murray2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=Cecil D.|year=1926|title=The Physiological Principle of Minimum Work: II.

Larger vessels lower the expended energy for transport, but increase the overall volume of blood in the system; blood being a living fluid and hence requiring metabolic support. Murray's law is therefore an optimisation exercise to balance these factors.

For &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; child branches splitting from a common parent branch, the law states that:

&lt;math&gt;r^3 = r_1^3 + r_2^3 + r_3^3 +...+ r_n^3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the parent branch, and &lt;math&gt;r_1, \ldots, r_n&lt;/math&gt; are the radii of the child branches. This law is only valid for [[laminar flow]], since its derivation uses the [[Hagen-Poiseuille equation]] as a measure for the transport work (see below). Williams et al. deduced the formula for [[turbulent flow]]:&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Hugo R.|year=2008|title=Minimum mass vascular networks in multifunctional materials|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/18/55.full|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume=5|issue=18|pages=55–65|doi=10.1098/rsif.2007.1022|pmc=2605499|pmid=17426011|author2=Trask, Richard S.|author3=Weaver, Paul M.|author4=Bond, Ian P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;r^{(7/3)} = r_1^{(7/3)} + r_2^{(7/3)} + r_3^{(7/3)} + ... + r_n^{(7/3)} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Derivation ===

As stated above, the underlying assumption of the Murray's law is that the [[Power (physics)|power]] ([[energy (physics)|energy]] per [[time]]) for transport and upkeep is minimal in a natural transport system. Hence we seek to minimize &lt;math&gt;P = P_t + P_m&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P_t&lt;/math&gt; is the power required for transport and &lt;math&gt;P_m&lt;/math&gt; the power required to maintain the transport medium (e.g. blood).

==== Laminar Flow ====

We first minimize the power of transport and upkeep in a single channel of the system, i.e. ignore bifurcations. Together with the assumption of mass-conservation this will yield the law. Let &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; be the [[laminar flow|laminar]] [[volumetric flow rate|flow rate]] in this channel, which is assumed to be fixed. The power for transport in a laminar flow is &lt;math&gt;P_t = Q \Delta p&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta p&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure difference between the entry and exit of a tube of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Hagen-Poiseuille Law]] for laminar flow states that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Q = \frac{\pi\,r^4}{8\,\mu\,l}\Delta p&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\Delta p = \frac{8\,\mu\,l}{\pi\,r^4} Q&lt;/math&gt; , where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dynamic viscosity]] of the fluid. Substituting this into the equation for &lt;math&gt;P_t&lt;/math&gt;, we get&lt;math display="block"&gt;P_t = \frac{8\,\mu\,l}{\pi\,r^4} Q^2.&lt;/math&gt;We furthermore make the assumption that the power necessary for maintenance is proportional to the [[Volume#Volume formulas|volume of the cylinder]] &lt;math&gt;V = \pi\,l\,r^2&lt;/math&gt; :&lt;math display="block"&gt;P_m = \lambda\,V = \lambda\,\pi\,l\,r^2&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is a constant number (metabolic factor). This yields&lt;math display="block"&gt;P = P_t + P_m = \frac{8\,\mu\,l}{\pi\,r^4} Q^2 + \lambda\,\pi\,l\,r^2. &lt;/math&gt;Since we seek the radius with minimal power, we calculate the [[stationary point]] with respect to r &lt;math display="block"&gt;{\operatorname{d}\over\operatorname{d}\!r} P = 0 \;\Leftrightarrow\; - \frac{32\,\mu\,l}{\pi\,r^5} Q^2 + 2\,\lambda\,\pi\,l\,r = 0 \;\Leftrightarrow\; Q^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{16} \frac{\lambda}{\mu} r^6 \;\Leftarrow\; Q = \frac{\pi}{4} \sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{\mu}} r^3. &lt;/math&gt;With this relationship between the flow rate &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; on an arbitrary channel, we return to the bifurcation: Since mass is conserved, the flow rate of the parent branch &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of the flow rates in the children branches &lt;math&gt;Q_1, \ldots, Q_n&lt;/math&gt;. Since in each of these branches the power is minimized, the relationship above holds and hence, as claimed:&lt;math display="block"&gt; Q = \sum_{i=1}^N Q_i \;\Rightarrow\; \frac{\pi}{4} \sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{\mu}} \, r^3 = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\pi}{4} \sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{\mu}}\, r_i^3 \; \Rightarrow\; r^3 = \sum_{i=1}^N  r_i^3.&lt;/math&gt;

==== Diffusion ====

The power for transport spent by diffusion is given by

&lt;math&gt;P_t = Q\,\Delta C = \left( \pi\,D\,r^2 \frac{\Delta C}{l}\right) \Delta C&lt;/math&gt;

where the flow rate is given by Fick's Law, whose &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diffusivity constant and &lt;math&gt;\Delta C&lt;/math&gt; is the difference of concentration between the ends of the cylinder. Similarly to the case of laminar flow, the minimisation of the objective function results in

&lt;math&gt; \frac{\Delta C}{l} = \sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{D}} \Rightarrow Q = \pi\,D\,r^2 \sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{D}} \Leftrightarrow Q = k\,r^2&lt;/math&gt;

Hence,

&lt;math&gt; Q_p = \sum_{i=1}^N Q_i \Rightarrow k\, r_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N k\, r_i^2 \Leftrightarrow r_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N  r_i^2&lt;/math&gt;

== The generalized Murray’s law ==

However, the special Murray’s law is only applicable to flow processes involving no mass variations. Significant theoretical advances need to be made for more broadly applicable in the fields of chemistry, applied materials, and industrial reactions.

For connecting a parent pipe with radius of '''''r&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''''' to many children pipes with radius of '''''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''''' , the formula of generalized Murray's law is: &lt;math&gt;r_o^a={1 \over 1-X}\sum_{i=1}^Nr_i^a&lt;/math&gt;, where the '''''X''''' is the ratio of mass variation during mass transfer in the parent pore, the exponent '''''α''''' is dependent on the type of the transfer. For laminar flow ''α'' =3; for turbulent flow ''α'' =7/3; for molecule or ionic diffusion ''α'' =2; etc.

To achieve substances or energy transfer with extremely high efficiency, evolution by natural selection has endowed many classes of organisms with Murray materials, in which the pore-sizes regularly decrease across multiple scales and finally terminate in size-invariant units. For example, in [[plant stem]]s and [[Leaf|leaf veins]], the sum of the radii cubed remains constant across every branch point to maximize the flow conductance, which is proportional to the rate of photosynthesis. For [[insect]]s relying upon gas diffusion for breathing, the sum of radii squared of tracheal pores remains constant along the diffusion pathway, to maximize gases diffusion. From plants, animals and materials to industrial processes, [https://uk.news.yahoo.com/leaf-vein-structure-might-help-114254703.html the introduction of Murray material concept to industrial reactions can revolutionize the design of reactors with highly enhanced efficiency, minimum energy, time, and raw material consumption for a sustainable future.]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57878">The '''nature versus nurture''' debate involves whether human behavior is determined by the environment, either [[prenatal development|prenatal]] or during a person's life, or [[behavioral genetics|by a person's genes]]. The alliterative expression "nature and nurture" in English has been in use since at least the Elizabethan period&lt;ref&gt;In English at least since Shakespeare (''[[The Tempest]]'' 4.1: ''a born devil, on whose nature nurture can never stick'') and [[Richard Barnfield]] (''Nature and nurture once together met / The soule and shape in decent order set.''); in the 18th century used by [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke]] (''Roach v. Garvan'', "I appointed therefore the mother guardian, who is properly so by nature and nurture, where there is no testamentary guardian.")&lt;/ref&gt; and goes back to [[medieval French]].&lt;ref&gt;English usage is based on a tradition going back to medieval literature, where the opposition of ''nature'' ("instinct, inclination")  ''norreture'' ("culture, adopted mores") is a common motif, famously in [[Chretien de Troyes]]' ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail|Perceval]]'', where the hero's effort to suppress his natural impulse of compassion in favor of what he considers proper courtly behavior leads to catastrophe. 
Lacy, Norris J. (1980) ''The Craft of Chrétien de Troyes: An Essay on Narrative Art'', Brill Archive, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GekUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 5].&lt;/ref&gt;
The combination of the two concepts as complementary is ancient ([[Classical Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἁπό φύσεως καὶ εὐτροφίας}}&lt;ref&gt;in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' 351b; an opposition is made by Protagoras' character between ''art'' on one hand and ''constitution and fit nurture'' (nature and nurture) of the soul on the other, ''art'' (as well as ''rage and madness'';  ἀπὸ τέχνης  ἀπὸ θυμοῦ γε καὶ ἀπὸ μανίας) contributing to ''boldness'' (θάρσος), but ''nature and nurture'' combine to contribute to ''courage'' (ἀνδρεία). "Protagoras, in spite of the misgiving of Socrates, has no scruple in announcing himself a teacher of virtue, because virtue in the sense by him understood seems sufficiently secured by nature and nurture." Mackay, R. W. (1869) "Introduction to the ''Meno'' in comparison with the ''Protagoras''" [https://books.google.com/books?id=bHHJoQoeIS0C&amp;pg=PA138 p. 138] in ''Meno: A Dialogue on the Nature and Meaning of Education''.&lt;/ref&gt;). Nature is what we think of as pre-wiring and is influenced by genetic inheritance and other biological factors. Nurture is generally taken as the influence of external factors after conception e.g. the product of exposure, experience and learning on an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://simplypsychology.org/naturevsnurture.html|title=Nature Nurture in Psychology {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=simplypsychology.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase in its modern sense was popularized by the English Victorian polymath [[Francis Galton]], the modern founder of [[eugenics]] and [[behavioral genetics]], discussing the influence of [[heredity]] and &lt;!--social--&gt;environment on social advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_uE-bpGo2N4C&amp;pg=PA227 |title=Proceedings, Volume 7 |publisher=Royal Institution of Great Britain |date=1875}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CCepY1AJYNQC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=Nature+versus+nurture+galton&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=English Men of Science: Their Nature and Nurture|author= Francis Galton |publisher=  D.

The view that humans acquire all or almost all their behavioral traits from "nurture" was termed ''[[tabula rasa]]'' ("blank slate") by [[John Locke]] in 1690. A "blank slate view" in human developmental psychology assuming that human behavioral traits develop almost exclusively from environmental influences, was widely held during much of the 20th century (sometimes termed "blank-slatism").
The debate between "blank-slate" denial of the influence of heritability, and the view admitting both environmental and heritable traits, has often been cast in terms of nature ''versus'' nurture. These two conflicting approaches to human development were at the core of an ideological dispute over research agendas throughout the second half of the 20th century. As both "nature" and "nurture" factors were found to contribute substantially, often in an extricable manner, such views were seen as naive or outdated by most scholars of human development by the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, David S. (2003).

The strong dichotomy of nature ''versus'' nurture has thus been claimed to have limited relevance in some fields of research. Close [[feedback]] loops have been found in which "nature" and "nurture" influence one another constantly, as seen in [[self-domestication]]. In [[ecology]] and behavioral genetics, researchers think nurture has an essential influence on nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Powledge, Tabitha M. |title=Behavioral Epigenetics: How Nurture Shapes Nature|journal=[[BioScience]] |volume=61 |issue=8 |pages=588–592 |date=August 2011 |doi=10.1525/bio.2011.61.8.4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Normile, Dennis |title=Nature From Nurture |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=351 |issue=6276 |pages=908–910 |date=February 2016|subscription=yes |doi=10.1126/science.351.6276.908}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in other fields, the dividing line between an inherited and an acquired trait becomes unclear, as in [[epigenetics]]&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=David S.|title=The Developing Genome: An Introduction to Behavioral Epigenetics|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199922345|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Prenatal development|fetal development]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edge.org/response-detail/25365 Edge.org: Nature Versus Nurture]. edge.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gutiérrez, Luci (January 24, 2014)  [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304302704579334954138196792 Time to Retire The Simplicity of Nature vs. Nurture], ''Wall Street Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the debate==
[[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690) is often cited as the foundational document of the "blank slate" view. Locke was criticizing [[René Descartes]]'s claim of an [[innate idea]] of [[God]] universal to humanity.
Locke's view was harshly criticized in his own time. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury]], complained that by denying the possibility of any innate ideas, 
Locke  "threw all order and virtue out of the world", leading to total [[moral relativism]].
Locke's was not the predominant view in the 19th century, which on the contrary tended to focus on "[[instinct]]".
Leda Cosmides and John Tooby noted that [[William James]] (1842–1910) argued that humans have ''more'' instincts than animals, and that greater freedom of action is the result of having more psychological instincts, not fewer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html Cosmides &amp; Tooby, Evolutionary Psychology: A Primer]. psych.ucsb.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of "innate ideas" or "instincts" were of some importance in the discussion of [[free will]] in [[moral philosophy]]. In 18th-century philosophy, this was cast in terms of "innate ideas" establishing the presence of a universal virtue, prerequisite for objective morals. In the 20th century, this argument was in a way inverted, as some philosophers now argued that the evolutionary origins of human behavioral traits forces us to concede that there is no foundation for ethics ([[J. L. Mackie]]), while others treat ethics as a field in complete isolation from evolutionary considerations ([[Thomas Nagel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metanexus.net/metanexus_online/show_article2.asp?ID=6008 |first=John |last=Mizonni |title=Ruse's Darwinian ethics and Moral Realism |publisher=Metanexus Institute |work=metanexus.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001133708/http://www.metanexus.net/metanexus_online/show_article2.asp?id=6008 |archivedate=2006-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, there was an increased interest in the role of the environment, as a reaction to the strong focus on pure heredity in the wake of the triumphal success of Darwin's theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Craven, Hamilton (1978) ''The Triumph of Evolution:  The Heredity-Environment Controversy, 1900–1941'': 
"While it would be inaccurate to say that most American experimentalists concluded as the result of the general acceptance of Mendelism by 1910 or so that heredity was all powerful and environment of no consequence, it was nevertheless true that heredity occupied a much more prominent place than environment in their writings."&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, the [[social sciences]] developed as the project of studying the influence of culture in clean isolation from questions related to "biology".
[[Franz Boas]]'s  ''[[The Mind of Primitive Man]]'' (1911) established a program that would dominate American anthropology for the next fifteen years. In this study he established that in any given population, biology, language, material and symbolic culture, are autonomous; that each is an equally important dimension of human nature, but that no one of these dimensions is reducible to another.

The tool of [[twin study|twin studies]] was developed as a research design intended to exclude all confounders based on [[behavioural genetics|inherited behavioral traits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rende|first=R. D.|last2=Plomin|first2=R.|last3=Vandenberg|first3=S. G.|date=March 1990|title=Who discovered the twin method?|journal=Behavior Genetics|volume=20|issue=2|pages=277–285|issn=0001-8244|pmid=2191648}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such studies are designed to decompose the variability of a given trait in a given population into a genetic and an environmental component.

[[John B. Watson]] in the 1920s and 1930s established the school of purist [[behaviorism]] that would become dominant over the following decades. Watson is often said to have been convinced of the complete dominance of cultural influence over anything that heredity might contribute, based on the following quote which is frequently repeated without context:
:"Give me a dozen healthy infants, well-formed, and my own specified world to bring them up in and I'll guarantee to take any one at random and train him to become any type of specialist I might select – doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief and, yes, even beggar-man and thief, regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors. I am going beyond my facts and I admit it, but so have the advocates of the contrary and they have been doing it for many thousands of years"  (''Behaviorism'', 1930, p. 82).

The last sentence of the above quote is frequently omitted, leading to confusion about Watson's position. 

During the 1940s to 1960s, [[Ashley Montagu]] was a notable proponent of this purist form of behaviorism which allowed no contribution from heredity whatsoever: 

:"Man is man because he has no instincts, because everything he is and has become he has learned, acquired, from his culture ... with the exception of the instinctoid reactions in infants to sudden withdrawals of support and to sudden loud noises, the human being is entirely instinctless."&lt;ref&gt;''Man and Aggression'' (1968) cited after Pinker, Steven (2002) ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature'', Penguin, New York, {{ISBN|1501264338}}, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Calvin Hall&lt;ref&gt;Hall, C. S. (1951) "The Genetics of Behavior", pp. 304–329 in ''Handbook of Experimental Psychology'', S. S. Stevens (Ed.), New York, NY, USA: John Wiley and Sons&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the dichotomy opposing nature to nurture is ultimately fruitless.

[[Robert Ardrey]] in the 1960s argued for innate attributes of human nature, especially concerning [[territoriality]], in the widely read ''African Genesis'' (1961) and ''[[The Territorial Imperative]]''. [[Desmond Morris]] in ''[[The Naked Ape]]''  (1967) expressed similar views.
Organised opposition to Montagu's kind of purist "blank-slatism" began to pick up in the 1970s, notably led by [[E. O. Wilson]] (''[[On Human Nature]]'' 1979).
Twin studies established that there was, in many cases, a significant heritable component. 
These results did not in any way point to overwhelming contribution of heritable factors, with heritability typically ranging around 40% to 50%, so that the controversy may not be cast in terms of purist behaviorism vs. purist nativism. Rather, it was purist behaviorism which was gradually replaced by the now-predominant view that both kinds of factors usually contribute to a given trait, anecdotally phrased by [[Donald O. Hebb|Donald Hebb]] as an answer to the question  "which, nature or nurture, contributes more to personality?" by asking in response, "Which contributes more to the area of a rectangle, its length or its width?"&lt;ref&gt;Meaney M. (2004) "The nature of nurture: maternal effects and chromatin remodelling", in ''Essays in Social Neuroscience'', Cacioppo, J. T. &amp; Berntson, G. G. (eds.) MIT press. {{ISBN|0-262-03323-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a comparable avenue of research,  anthropologist Donald Brown in the 1980s surveyed hundreds of anthropological studies from around the world and collected a set of [[cultural universals]]. He identified approximately 150 such features, coming to the conclusion there is indeed a "universal human nature", and that these features point to what that universal human nature is.&lt;ref&gt;Pinker (2002), pp. 435–439.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of the controversy, during the 1970s to 1980s, the debate was highly ideologised. In ''[[Not in Our Genes: Biology, Ideology and Human Nature]]'' (1984), [[Richard Lewontin]], [[Steven Rose]] and [[Leon Kamin]] criticise "[[genetic determinism]]" from a [[Marxist]] framework, arguing that "Science is the ultimate legitimator of bourgeois ideology ... If [[biological determinism]] is a weapon in the struggle between classes, then the universities are weapons factories, and their teaching and research faculties are the engineers, designers, and production workers." The debate thus shifted away from whether heritable traits exist to whether it was politically or ethically permissible to admit their existence. The authors deny this, requesting that evolutionary inclinations be discarded in ethical and political discussions regardless of whether they exist or not.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, A. (2008) ''The Brighter Side of Human Nature''. Basic Books. {{ISBN|078672465X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heritability studies became much easier to perform, and hence much more numerous, with the advances of genetic studies during the 1990s. By the late 1990s, an overwhelming amount of evidence had accumulated that amounts to a refutation of the extreme forms of "blank-slatism" advocated by Watson or Montagu.

This revised state of affairs was summarized in books aimed at a popular audience from the late 1990s. In ''[[The Nurture Assumption: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do]]'' (1998), [[Judith Rich Harris]] was heralded by [[Steven Pinker]] as a book that "will come to be seen as a turning point in the [[history of psychology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harris, Judith Rich |title=The Nurture Assumption: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do, Revised and Updated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uKBJRMJBjcC&amp;pg=PR21|date=24 February 2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-0165-0|pages=21–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
but Harris was criticized for exaggerating the point of "parental upbringing seems to matter less than previously thought" to the implication that "parents do not matter".&lt;ref&gt;A position not actually taken by the author, but apparently it was feared that "lay readers" would still interpret the book in this way, as in  "Will it free some to mistreat their kids, since 'it doesn't matter'?", with this fear being attributed to "psychologist Frank Farley of Temple University, president of the APA division that honored Harris" by {{cite news |last=Begley |first=Sharon |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/newsweek/parent090798a.htm |title=The Parent Trap |newspaper=Newsweek |date=1998-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation as it presented itself by the end of the 20th century was summarized in ''[[The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature]]'' (2002) by [[Steven Pinker]]. The book became a best-seller, and was instrumental in bringing to the attention of a wider public the paradigm shift away from the behaviourist purism of the 1940s to 1970s that had taken place over the preceding decades. Pinker portrays the adherence to pure blank-slatism as an ideological [[dogma]] linked to two other dogmas found in the dominant view of human nature in the 20th century, which he termed "[[noble savage]]" (in the sense that people are born good and corrupted by bad influence) and 
"[[ghost in the machine]]"  (in the sense that there is a human soul capable of moral choices completely detached from biology). Pinker argues that all three dogmas were held onto for an extended period even in the face of evidence because they were seen as ''desirable'' in the sense that if any human trait is purely conditioned by culture, any undesired trait (such as crime or aggression) may be engineered away by purely cultural (political means). Pinker focuses on reasons he assumes were responsible for unduly repressing evidence to the contrary, notably the fear of (imagined or projected) political or ideological consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Pinker, Steven |url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/index.html |title=Steven Pinker – Books – The Blank Slate |publisher=Pinker.wjh.harvard.edu |accessdate=2011-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510091413/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/index.html |archivedate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heritability estimates==
{{main|Heritability}}
[[File:Sibling-correlation-422.png|422px|thumb|right|This chart illustrates three patterns one might see when studying the influence of genes and environment on traits in individuals. Trait A shows a high sibling correlation, but little heritability (i.e. high shared environmental variance ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; low heritability ''h''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Trait B shows a high heritability since correlation of trait rises sharply with the degree of genetic similarity. Trait C shows low heritability, but also low correlations generally; this means Trait C has a high nonshared environmental variance ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, the degree to which individuals display Trait C has little to do with either genes or broadly predictable environmental factors—roughly, the outcome approaches random for an individual. Notice also that even identical twins raised in a common family rarely show 100% trait correlation.]]

It is important to note that the term ''heritability'' refers only to the degree of genetic variation between people on a trait.  It does not refer to the degree to which a trait of a particular individual is due to environmental or genetic factors. The traits of an individual are always a complex interweaving of both.&lt;ref name=PinkerBlankSlate&gt;Pinker, Steven (September 30, 2002) ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature''.  Viking; 1st edition. {{ISBN|978-0670031511}}. [http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ff0616s.pdf Lay summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226054452/http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ff0616S.pdf |date=2014-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For an individual, even strongly genetically influenced, or "obligate" traits, such as eye color, assume the inputs of a typical environment during ontogenetic development (e.g., certain ranges of temperatures, oxygen levels, etc.).

In contrast, the "heritability index" statistically quantifies the extent to which variation ''between individuals'' on a trait is due to variation in the genes those individuals carry. In animals where breeding and environments can be controlled experimentally, heritability can be determined relatively easily. Such experiments would be unethical for human research. This problem can be overcome by finding existing populations of humans that reflect the experimental setting the researcher wishes to create.

One way to determine the contribution of genes and environment to a trait is to [[twin study|study twins]]. In one kind of study, [[identical twins]] reared apart are compared to randomly selected pairs of people. The twins share identical genes, but different family environments. In another kind of twin study, identical twins reared together (who share family environment and genes) are compared to [[fraternal twins]] reared together (who also share family environment but only share half their genes). Another condition that permits the disassociation of genes and environment is [[adoption]]. In one kind of [[adoption study]], biological siblings reared together (who share the same family environment and half their genes) are compared to adoptive siblings (who share their family environment but none of their genes).

In many cases, it has been found that genes make a substantial contribution, including psychological traits such as intelligence and personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Neill, J. T. |year=2004 |url=http://www.wilderdom.com/personality/L4-1IntelligenceNatureVsNurture.html |title=Nature vs Nurture in Intelligence |website=wilderdom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet heritability may differ in other circumstances, for instance environmental deprivation. Examples of low, medium, and high heritability traits include:

&lt;center&gt;
{|class="wikitable" style="width:60%;"
|-
!Low heritability!!Medium heritability!!High heritability
|-
|align=center|Specific language||align=center|Weight||align=center|Blood type
|-
|align=center|Specific religion||align=center|Religiosity||align=center|Eye color
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Twin and adoption studies have their methodological limits.  For example, both are limited to the range of environments and genes which they sample.  Almost all of these studies are conducted in Western, first-world countries, and therefore cannot be extrapolated globally to include poorer, non-western populations.  Additionally, both types of studies depend on particular assumptions, such as the [[equal environments assumption]] in the case of twin studies, and the lack of pre-adoptive effects in the case of adoption studies.

Since the definition of "nature" in this context is tied to "heritability", the definition of "nurture" has necessarily become very wide, including any type of causality that is not heritable. The term has thus moved away from its original connotation of "cultural influences" to include all effects of the environment, including; indeed, a substantial source of environmental input to [[human nature]] may arise from stochastic variations in prenatal development and is thus in no sense of the term "cultural".&lt;ref name="pmid9331275"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Rice D.

==Interaction of genes and environment==
{{main|Gene–environment interaction}}
{{off topic|date=March 2015}}&lt;!--this page should be about the history of the "nature vs. nurture" debate, not on current or emerging views of this related but very specific sub-topic--&gt;
{{rquote|right|Many properties of the brain are genetically organized, and don't depend on information coming in from the senses.|[[Steven Pinker]]}}
Heritability refers to the origins of differences between people. Individual development, even of highly heritable traits, such as eye color, depends on a range of environmental factors, from the other genes in the organism, to physical variables such as temperature, oxygen levels etc. during its development or ontogenesis.

The variability of trait can be meaningfully spoken of as being due in certain proportions to genetic differences ("nature"), or environments ("nurture"). For highly [[wikt:penetrant|penetrant]] [[Mendelian]] genetic disorders such as [[Huntington's disease]] virtually all the incidence of the disease is due to genetic differences. Huntington's animal models live much longer or shorter lives depending on how they are cared for {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.

At the other extreme, traits such as [[native language]] are environmentally determined: linguists have found that any child (if capable of learning a language at all) can learn any human language with equal facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jespersen|first=Otto|title=Language, its nature, development, and origin|year=1922|publisher=H. Holt}}&lt;/ref&gt; With virtually all biological and psychological traits, however, genes and environment work in concert, communicating back and forth to create the individual.

At a molecular level, genes interact with signals from other genes and from the environment. While there are many thousands of single-gene-locus traits, so-called [[complex traits]] are due to the additive effects of many (often hundreds) of small gene effects. A good example of this is height, where variance appears to be spread across many hundreds of loci.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/ng.608 |pmid=20562875 |title=Common SNPs explain a large proportion of the heritability for human height |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=42 |issue=7 |pages=565–9 |year=2010 |last1=Yang |first1=Jian |last2=Benyamin |first2=Beben |last3=McEvoy |first3=Brian P |last4=Gordon |first4=Scott |last5=Henders |first5=Anjali K |last6=Nyholt |first6=Dale R |last7=Madden |first7=Pamela A |last8=Heath |first8=Andrew C |last9=Martin |first9=Nicholas G |last10=Montgomery |first10=Grant W |last11=Goddard |first11=Michael E |last12=Visscher |first12=Peter M |pmc=3232052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extreme genetic or environmental conditions can predominate in rare circumstances—if a child is born mute due to a genetic mutation, it will not learn to speak any language regardless of the environment; similarly, someone who is practically certain to eventually develop Huntington's disease according to their genotype may die in an unrelated accident (an environmental event) long before the disease will manifest itself.

[[Steven Pinker]] likewise described several examples:&lt;ref&gt;[https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3600799/pinker_whynature.pdf?sequence=2 Why nature &amp; nurture won't go away. Harvard Online PDF Pinker, Steven. 2004. Why nature &amp; nurture won't go away. Daedalus 133(4): 5-17.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Pinker|first=Steven|author-link=Steven Pinker|title=[[The Blank Slate|The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature]]|year=2002|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:concrete behavioral traits that patently depend on content provided by the home or culture—which language one speaks, which religion one practices, which political party one supports—are not heritable at all. But traits that reflect the underlying talents and temperaments—how proficient with language a person is, how religious, how liberal or conservative—are partially heritable.

When traits are determined by a complex interaction of [[genotype]] and environment it is possible to measure the [[heritability]] of a trait within a population. However, many non-scientists who encounter a report of a trait having a certain percentage heritability imagine non-interactional, additive contributions of genes and environment to the trait. As an analogy, some laypeople may think of the degree of a trait being made up of two "buckets," genes and environment, each able to hold a certain capacity of the trait. But even for intermediate heritabilities, a trait is always shaped by both genetic dispositions and the environments in which people develop, merely with greater and lesser plasticities associated with these heritability measures.

Heritability measures always refer to the degree of ''variation between individuals in a population''. That is, as these statistics cannot be applied at the level of the individual, it would be incorrect to say that while the heritability index of personality is about 0.6, 60% of one's personality is obtained from one's parents and 40% from the environment. To help to understand this, imagine that all humans were genetic clones. The heritability index for all traits would be zero (all variability between clonal individuals must be due to environmental factors). And, contrary to erroneous interpretations of the heritability index, as societies become more egalitarian (everyone has more similar experiences) the heritability index goes up (as environments become more similar, variability between individuals is due more to genetic factors).

One should also take into account the fact that the variables of heritability and environmentality are not precise and vary within a chosen population and across cultures. It would be more accurate to state that the degree of heritability and environmentality is measured in its reference to a particular phenotype in a chosen group of a population in a given period of time. The accuracy of the calculations is further hindered by the number of coefficients taken into consideration, age being one such variable. The display of the influence of heritability and environmentality differs drastically across age groups: the older the studied age is, the more noticeable the heritability factor becomes, the younger the test subjects are, the more likely it is to show signs of strong influence of the environmental factors.

Some have pointed out that environmental inputs affect the expression of genes&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt; (see the article on [[epigenetics]]). This is one explanation of how environment can influence the extent to which a genetic disposition will actually manifest.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The interactions of genes with environment, called [[gene–environment interaction]]s, are another component of the nature–nurture debate. A classic example of gene–environment interaction is the ability of a diet low in the amino acid [[phenylalanine]] to partially suppress the genetic disease [[phenylketonuria]]. Yet another complication to the nature–nurture debate is the existence of [[gene–environment correlation]]s. These correlations indicate that individuals with certain genotypes are more likely to find themselves in certain environments. Thus, it appears that genes can shape (the selection or creation of) environments. Even using experiments like those described above, it can be very difficult to determine convincingly the relative contribution of genes and environment.

A study conducted by T. J. Bouchard, Jr. showed data that has been evidence for the importance of genes when testing middle-aged twins reared together and reared apart. The results shown have been important evidence against the importance of environment when determining, happiness, for example. In the Minnesota study of twins reared apart, it was actually found that there was higher correlation for monozygotic twins reared apart (0.52)than monozygotic twins reared together (0.44). Also, highlighting the importance of genes, these correlations found much higher correlation among monozygotic than dizygotic twins that had a correlation of 0.08 when reared together and −0.02 when reared apart.&lt;ref name=lykken1996&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00355.x |url=http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/courses/psyc5112/Readings/psnHappiness_Lykken.pdf|title=Happiness is a Stochastic Phenomenon|journal=Psychological Science|volume=7|issue=3|pages=186–189|year=1996|last1=Lykken|first1=David|last2=Tellegen|first2=Auke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social pre-wiring===
{{One source section|date=December 2017}}
'''The social pre-wiring hypothesis''' refers to the [[ontogeny]] of [[social relation|social interaction]]. Also informally referred to as, "wired to be social." The theory questions whether there is a propensity to [[social actions|socially oriented action]] already present ''before'' birth. Research in the theory concludes that newborns are born into the world with a unique [[genetics|genetic]] wiring to be social.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951360/ Umberto Castiello, et al: National Institutes of Health&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumstantial evidence supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, have been found to display a preparedness for [[social relation|social interaction]]. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of [[socialization]] or [[social construction]]. Rather, newborns most likely [[heredity|inherit]] to some extent [[social behavior]] and [[identity (social science)|identity]] through [[genetics]].&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

Principal evidence of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are [[social behavior]]s that are [[heredity|inherited]] and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage in some form of [[social relation|social interaction]] before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed over a period of time using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

The social pre-wiring hypothesis was proved correct, "The central advance of this study is the demonstration that '[[social actions]]' are already performed in the second trimester of [[gestational age|gestation]]. Starting from the 14th week of [[gestational age|gestation]] twin foetuses plan and execute movements specifically aimed at the co-twin. These findings force us to predate the emergence of [[social behavior]]: when the context enables it, as in the case of twin foetuses, other-directed actions are not only possible but predominant over self-directed actions.".&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

===Obligate vs. facultative adaptations===
Traits may be considered to be adaptations (such as the umbilical cord), byproducts of adaptations (the belly button) or due to random variation (convex or concave belly button shape).&lt;ref name=Buss2011/&gt;
An alternative to contrasting nature and nurture focuses on  "obligate vs. facultative" adaptations.&lt;ref name=Buss2011&gt;Buss, D. M. (2011). Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind (4 ed.). New York: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptations may be generally more obligate (robust in the face of typical environmental variation) or more facultative (sensitive to typical environmental variation).  For example, the rewarding sweet taste of sugar and the pain of bodily injury are obligate psychological adaptations—typical environmental variability during development does not much affect their operation.&lt;ref&gt;Symons, D. (1979). The evolution of human sexuality. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, facultative adaptations are somewhat like "if-then" statements.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, K. (2013).  [http://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-12-heritability.html Explainer: What is Heritability?].  MedicalXpress.com&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of a facultative psychological adaptation may be adult [[attachment style]]. The attachment style of adults, (for example, a "secure attachment style," the propensity to develop close, trusting bonds with others) is proposed to be conditional on whether an individual's early childhood caregivers could be trusted to provide reliable assistance and attention. An example of a facultative physiological adaptation is tanning of skin on exposure to sunlight (to prevent skin damage). Facultative social adaptation have also been proposed. For example, whether a society is warlike or peaceful has been proposed to be conditional on how much collective threat that society is experiencing &lt;ref name=Fog2017&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fog |first1=Agner |date=2017 |title=Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture |url=https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/657 |publisher=Open Book Publishers |isbn=978-1-78374-403-9 |doi=10.11647/OBP.0128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Advanced techniques===

Quantitative studies of heritable traits throw light on the question.

Developmental genetic analysis examines the effects of genes over the course of a human lifespan. Early studies of intelligence, which mostly examined young children, found that [[heritability]] measured 40–50%. Subsequent developmental genetic analyses found that variance attributable to additive environmental effects is less apparent in older individuals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Plomin |first=R. |last2=Spinath |first2=F. M. |year=2004 |title=Intelligence: genetics, genes, and genomics |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=112–129 |pmid=14717631 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.1.112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGue, M.; Bouchard Jr., T.

Multivariate genetic analysis examines the genetic contribution to several traits that vary together. For example, multivariate genetic analysis has demonstrated that the genetic determinants of all specific cognitive abilities (e.g., memory, spatial reasoning, processing speed) overlap greatly, such that the genes associated with any specific cognitive ability will affect all others. Similarly, multivariate genetic analysis has found that genes that affect scholastic achievement completely overlap with the genes that affect cognitive ability.

Extremes analysis examines the link between normal and pathological traits. For example, it is hypothesized that a given behavioral disorder may represent an extreme of a continuous distribution of a normal behavior and hence an extreme of a continuous distribution of genetic and environmental variation. Depression, phobias, and reading disabilities have been examined in this context.

For a few highly heritable traits, studies have identified loci associated with variance in that trait, for instance in some individuals with [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harrison | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Owen | first2 = M. J. | year = 2003 | title = Genes for schizophrenia?

===Entrepreneurship===
Through studies of identical twins separated at birth, one-third of their creative thinking abilities come from genetics and two-thirds come from learning.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, Jeffrey H., Hal B. Gregersen, and Clayton M. Christensen. (2009). Harvard Business Review.&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that between 37 and 42 percent of the explained variance can be attributed to genetic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2009.07.002|title=The genetic basis of entrepreneurship: Effects of gender and personality|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=110|issue=2|pages=93–107|year=2009|last1=Zhang|first1=Zhen|last2=Zyphur|first2=Michael J.|last3=Narayanan|first3=Jayanth|last4=Arvey|first4=Richard D.|last5=Chaturvedi|first5=Sankalp|last6=Avolio|first6=Bruce J.|last7=Lichtenstein|first7=Paul|last8=Larsson|first8=Gerry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The learning primarily comes in the form of human capital transfers of entrepreneurial skills through parental role modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Lindquist, Matthew J., Sol, Joeri and Van Praag, Mirjam. (2012). [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2119047 Why Do Entrepreneurial Parents Have Entrepreneurial Children?] Institute for the Study of Labor.&lt;/ref&gt; Other findings agree that the key to innovative entrepreneurial success comes from environmental factors and working “10,000 hours” to gain mastery in entrepreneurial skills.&lt;ref&gt;Gladwell, Malcolm. (2008) ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers: The Story of Success]]''. Little, Brown and Company. {{ISBN|978-0316017923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heritability of intelligence==
{{Main|Heritability of IQ}}
Evidence from [[behavioral genetics|behavioral genetic]] research suggests that family environmental factors may have an effect upon childhood [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]], accounting for up to a quarter of the variance. The American Psychological Association's report "[[Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns]]" (1995) states that there is no doubt that normal child development requires a certain minimum level of responsible care. Here, environment is playing a role in what is believed to be fully genetic (intelligence) but it was found that severely deprived, neglectful, or abusive environments have highly negative effects on many aspects of children's intellect development. Beyond that minimum, however, the role of family experience is in serious dispute. On the other hand, by late adolescence this correlation disappears, such that adoptive siblings no longer have similar IQ scores.&lt;ref name=Plomin2008&gt;Plomin, R., DeFries, J. C., McClearn, G. E., &amp; McGuffn, P. (2008). ''Behavioral Genetics'' (5th edition). New York: Worth Publishers. {{ISBN|978-1429205771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, adoption studies indicate that, by adulthood, adoptive siblings are no more similar in IQ than strangers (IQ correlation near zero), while full siblings show an IQ correlation of 0.6. Twin studies reinforce this pattern: monozygotic (identical) twins raised separately are highly similar in IQ (0.74), more so than dizygotic (fraternal) twins raised together (0.6) and much more than adoptive siblings (~0.0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=41465638|pmid=9549239|year=1998|author1=Bouchard Jr|first1=T. J.|title=Genetic and environmental influences on adult intelligence and special mental abilities|journal=Human Biology|volume=70|issue=2|pages=257–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent adoption studies also found that supportive parents can have a positive effect on the development of their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.89.2.381|title=Same-age unrelated siblings: A unique test of within-family environmental influences on IQ similarity|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=89|issue=2|pages=381–390|year=1997|last1=Segal|first1=Nancy L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality traits==
{{Main|Personality psychology#Genetic basis of personality}}
[[Personality]] is a frequently cited example of a heritable trait that has been studied in twins and adoptees using [[behavioral genetics|behavioral genetic]] study designs. The most famous categorical organization of heritable personality traits were created by Goldberg (1990) in which he had college students rate their personalities on 1400 dimensions to begin, and then narrowed these down into "[[Big Five personality traits|''The Big Five'']]" factors of personality—Openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. The close genetic relationship between positive personality traits and, for example, our happiness traits are the mirror images of comorbidity in psychopathology. These personality factors were consistent across cultures, and many studies have also tested the heritability of these traits.

Identical twins reared apart are far more similar in personality than randomly selected pairs of people. Likewise, identical twins are more similar than fraternal twins. Also, biological siblings are more similar in personality than adoptive siblings. Each observation suggests that personality is heritable to a certain extent. A supporting article had focused on the heritability of personality (which is estimated to be around 50% for subjective well-being) in which a study was conducted using a representative sample of 973 twin pairs to test the heritable differences in subjective well-being which were found to be fully accounted for by the genetic model of the Five-Factor Model’s personality domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Weiss A., Bates T. C., Luciano M. |title=Happiness is a personal(ity) thing: the genetics of personality and well-being in a representative sample |journal=[[Psychological Science]] |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=205–10 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18315789 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02068.x |url=http://pss.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18315789 |accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these same study designs allow for the examination of environment as well as genes.

Adoption studies also directly measure the strength of shared family effects. Adopted siblings share only family environment.  Most adoption studies indicate that by adulthood the personalities of adopted siblings are little or no more similar than random pairs of strangers.  This would mean that shared family effects on personality are zero by adulthood.

In the case of personality traits, non-shared environmental effects are often found to out-weigh shared environmental effects. That is, environmental effects that are typically thought to be life-shaping (such as family life) may have less of an impact than non-shared effects, which are harder to identify. One possible source of non-shared effects is the environment of pre-natal development. Random variations in the genetic program of development may be a substantial source of non-shared environment. These results suggest that "nurture" may not be the predominant factor in "environment". Environment and our situations, do in fact impact our lives, but not the way in which we would typically react to these environmental factors. We are preset with personality traits that are the basis for how we would react to situations. An example would be how extraverted prisoners become less happy than introverted prisoners and would react to their incarceration more negatively due to their preset extraverted personality.&lt;ref name=PinkerBlankSlate/&gt;{{rp|Ch 19}} Behavioral genes are somewhat proven to exist when we take a look at fraternal twins. When fraternal twins are reared apart, they show the same similarities in behavior and response as if they have been reared together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://explorable.com/nature-vs-nurture-debate|title=Nature and Nurture Debate - Genes or Environment?|access-date=2017-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetics ==

===Genomics===
{{main|Genomics}}
The relationship between personality and people's own well-being is influenced and mediated by genes (Weiss, Bates, &amp; Luciano, 2008). There has been found to be a stable set point for happiness that is characteristic of the individual (largely determined by the individual's genes). Happiness fluctuates around that setpoint (again, genetically determined) based on whether good things or bad things are happening to us ("nurture"), but only fluctuates in small magnitude in a normal human. The midpoint of these fluctuations is determined by the "great genetic lottery" that people are born with, which leads them to conclude that how happy they may feel at the moment or over time is simply due to the luck of the draw, or gene. This fluctuation was also not due to educational attainment, which only accounted for less than 2% of the variance in well-being for women, and less than 1% of the variance for men.&lt;ref name=lykken1996/&gt;

They consider that the individualities measured together with personality tests remain steady throughout an individual’s lifespan. They further believe that human beings may refine their forms or personality but can never change them entirely. Darwin's Theory of Evolution steered naturalists such as George Williams and William Hamilton to the concept of personality evolution. They suggested that physical organs and also personality is a product of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herschkowitz, Herschkowitz, &amp; Kagan|first1=Norbert, M. &amp; Kagan|title=A Good Start In Life|date=2002|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[genomic sequencing]], it has become possible to search for and identify specific gene polymorphisms that affect traits such as IQ and personality. These techniques work by tracking the association of differences in a trait of interest with differences in specific molecular markers or functional variants. An example of a visible human trait for which the precise genetic basis of differences are relatively well known is [[eye color]]. For traits with many genes affecting the outcome, a smaller portion of the variance is currently understood: For instance for height known gene variants account for around 5–10% of height variance at present.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
When discussing the significant role of genetic heritability in relation to one's level of happiness, it has been found that from 44% to 52% of the variance in one's well-being is associated with genetic variation. Based on the retest of smaller samples of twins studies after 4,5, and 10 years, it is estimated that the heritability of the genetic stable component of subjective well-being approaches 80%.&lt;ref name=lykken1996/&gt; Other studies that have found that genes are a large influence in the variance found in happiness measures, exactly around 35–50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0033291705005374|pmid=16219116|title=Heritability of life satisfaction in adults: A twin-family study|journal=Psychological Medicine|volume=35|issue=11|pages=1581|year=2005|last1=Stubbe|first1=J.

In contrast to views developed in 1960s that gender identity is primarily learned (which led to policy-based surgical sex changed in children such as [[David Reimer]]), genomics has provided solid evidence that both sex and gender identities are primarily influenced by genes:

{{Quote|text=It is now clear that genes are vastly more influential than virtually any other force in shaping sex identity and gender identity…[T]he growing consensus in medicine is that…children should be assigned to their chromosomal (i.e., genetic) sex regardless of anatomical variations and differences—with the option of switching, if desired, later in life.|sign=[[Siddhartha Mukherjee]]|source=The Gene: An Intimate History}}

=== Linkage and association studies ===
In their attempts to locate the genes responsible for configuring certain phenotypes, researches resort to two different techniques.
Linkage study facilitates the process of determining a specific location in which a gene of interest is located. This methodology is applied only among individuals that are related and does not serve to pinpoint specific genes. It does, however, narrow down the area of search, making it easier to locate one or several genes in the genome which constitute a specific trait.

Association studies, on the other hand, are more hypothetic and seek to verify whether a particular genetic variable really influences the phenotype of interest. In association studies it is more common to use case-control approach, comparing the subject with relatively higher or lower hereditary determinants with the control subject.

The United States '''Naval Radiological Defense Laboratory''' ('''NRDL''') was an early military lab created to study the effects of radiation and nuclear weapons. The facility was based at the [[Treasure Island Naval Station Hunters Point Annex|Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard]] in San Francisco, California.

==History==
The NRDL was formed in 1946 to manage testing, decontamination, and disposition of US Navy ships contaminated by the [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear tests in the Pacific.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/fallout/Content?oid=2141635|title=Fallout|last=Davis|first=Lisa|website=SF Weekly|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of ships that survived the atomic detonations were towed to Hunter's Point for detailed study and decontamination. Some of the ships were cleaned and sold for scrap. The aircraft carrier [[USS Independence (CVL-22)|USS Independence,]] which had been heavily damaged and contaminated with nuclear fallout by Operation Crossroads explosions in July 1946, was brought to the NRDL for study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socket.kongshem.com/2007/10/farallon-islands-nuclear-waste-dump.html|title=:: Socket ::: The Farallon Islands Nuclear Waste Dump|website=socket.kongshem.com|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After years of trying in vain to decontaminate the ship enough that it could be safely sold for scrap, the Navy ultimately packed the ship full of nuclear waste and scuttled the radioactive hulk off California near the [[Farallon Islands]] in January 1951. The ship's wreck was discovered resting upright under 790m of water in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/17/us/sunken-navy-carrier-revealed/index.html|title=Aircraft carrier that survived atomic blasts surveyed|last=CNN|first=Brad Lendon|website=CNN|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_27931161/scientists-find-radioactive-aircraft-carrier-off-san-francisco|title=Scientists find radioactive WWII aircraft carrier off San Francisco coast|website=www.mercurynews.com|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NRDL used several buildings at the Hunter's Point shipyard from 1946 to 1969. Working with the newly formed [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|US Atomic Energy Commission]] (predecessor to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] established in 1974), the Navy conducted a wide variety of radiation experiments on materials and animals at the lab,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/hunters_point.htm|title=Hunters Point / San Francisco Naval Shipyard|last=Pike|first=John|website=www.globalsecurity.org|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the construction of a [[cyclotron]] on the site for use in radiation experiments and storage for various nuclear materials.

===Activities===
An article published 2 May 2001 in [[SF Weekly]] detailed various aspects of nuclear testing at NRDL from declassified records:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Quote|text= 
The NRDL often experimented with and disposed of nuclear material with little apparent concern that it was operating in the middle of a major metropolitan area. Among other things, historical documents show, scientists at the NRDL: 
* – Oversaw the dumping of huge amounts of contaminated sand and acid into San Francisco Bay after they were used in attempts to clean irradiated ships.
* – Spread radioactive material on- and off-base, as if it were fertilizer, to practice decontamination.
* – Burned radioactive fuel oil in a boiler, discharging the smoke into the atmosphere.
* – Sold radioactive ships as scrap metal to a private company in Alameda.
* – Hung a source of cobalt-60, a nuclear isotope that emits high-energy electromagnetic radiation similar to X-rays, in San Francisco Bay for two weeks, apparently just to see what would happen.
* – Conducted human experiments that included requiring people to drink radioactive elements.
* – Experimented with significant amounts of a wide variety of long-lived radiological poisons, including plutonium, cesium, uranium, thorium and radium.
* – Studied and disposed of thousands of irradiated mice, rats, dogs, goats, mules, and pigs, among other animals. At one point, the lab owned a ranch in Contra Costa County used specifically to raise animals for radiation testing.
* – Sought permission to dump 1,000 gallons of liquid waste containing "small amounts of fission products" into San Francisco Bay, as an experiment to study how tidal action would dilute the radioactivity. The experiment was meant as a precursor to the disposal of 1,000 gallons of liquid radioactive waste in the bay every day. (The documents do not say whether the experiment or the daily dumping occurred.) |source=http://www.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/fallout/Content?oid=2141635|author=Davis, Lisa |title=Fallout|last=Davis|first=Lisa|website=SF Weekly|access-date=16 June 2016}}

===Contamination===
The first use of radioactive materials at NRDL predated the issuing of licenses by the Atomic Energy Commission, but the AEC later issued licenses for a broad spectrum of radioactive materials to be used in research at the NRDL. Radioactive materials specific to nuclear weapon testing were exempted from AEC licensing. For closure of the NRDL in 1969, the AEC issued licenses for decommissioning activities. AEC licenses for the shipyard and NRDL were terminated in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/decommissioning/complex/hunters-point-naval-shipyard.html|title=NRC: Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard|website=www.nrc.gov|access-date=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NRDL testing and decontamination activities caused significant contamination of the shipyard site.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;https://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/3dc283e6c5d6056f88257426007417a2/42f5a316b6d2282488257d3300724f43/$FILE/60915851.pdf/RAD%20Program_Fact%20Sheet_Aug2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/3dc283e6c5d6056f88257426007417a2/42f5a316b6d2282488257d3300724f43/$FILE/60915851.pdf/RAD%20Program_Fact%20Sheet_Aug2014.pdf|title=United States Environmental Protection Agency Fact Sheet, Hunters Point Naval Shipyard Radiological Program|last=|first=|date=August 2014|website=United States Environmental Protection Agency Fact Sheet, Hunters Point Naval Shipyard Radiological Program|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NRDL and the military radiation training school at nearby [[Naval Station Treasure Island]] loaded the nuclear waste left from experiments into steel barrels and sent weekly barges to dump them offshore near the [[Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary|Gulf of the Farallons]], which is a US National Wildlife Refuge and a major commercial fishery. Between 1946 and 1970, records estimate the lab and naval station dumped an estimated 47,000 drums&lt;ref name="walrus.wr.usgs.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/farallon/radwaste.html|title=Gulf of the Farallones Disposal Issues – USGS PCMSC|website=walrus.wr.usgs.gov|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of nuclear waste in the Pacific Ocean 30 miles west of San Francisco, creating the first and largest offshore nuclear waste dump in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The USGS states the barrels contain only "low-level radioactive waste,"&lt;ref name="walrus.wr.usgs.gov" /&gt; but this is disputed by historical records and experts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304773104579268563658319196|title=Nuclear Waste Sits on Ocean Floor|last=Emshwiller|first=John R.|date=31 December 2013|last2=Searcey|first2=Dionne|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Navy completed a Historical Radiological Assessment of the Hunter's Point Shipyard in 2004, including the known NRDL facilities on the property, years after the SF Weekly article cited declassified documents showing that many sites and buildings used by NRDL were not included in the Navy's list of sites with potential for radiological contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML0425/ML042580203.pdf |title=Historical Radiological Assessment, Volume II, Use of General Radioactive Materials, 1939-2003, Hunters Point Shipyard |author= |date=August 2004 |publisher=United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission |accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the buildings formerly used by NRDL had been razed by that point.

The former shipyard site is still being decontaminated, and has been split into multiple parcels to allow the Navy to declare them clean and safe for redevelopment separately.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While developer [[Lennar Corporation|Lennar]] has built and sold hundreds of new condominium units in the [[SF Shipyard]] development on the property,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/science/article/Housing-blooms-at-last-at-once-toxic-Hunters-6314858.php|title=Housing blooms at last at once-toxic Hunters Point shipyard site|website=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of regulators, activists, and cleanup workers have claimed that the site is still heavily contaminated and that the company contracted to handle the cleanup and testing, [[Tetra Tech]] has repeatedly violated established cleanup protocols,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Former-Contractors-Claim-Hunters-Point-Cleanup-is-Botched-259871511.html|title=Former Contractors Claim Hunters Point Cleanup is Botched|website=NBC Bay Area|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; deliberately falsified radiation test results at the site to falsely show that there is little remaining radiation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/Former-Hunters-Point-Worker-Claims-Supervisors-Ordered-Him-to-Hide-Radiation-371723561.html|title=Worker Claims Supervisors Ordered Him to Hide Radiation|website=NBC Bay Area|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nuclear-news.net/2014/10/15/radiation-samples-falsified-to-make-hunters-point-look-clean/|title=Radiation samples falsified to make Hunters Point look clean|date=15 October 2014|website=nuclear-news|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fired employees who attempted to force workers to perform radiation tests as required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/Regulators-Question-Hunters-Point-Radiation-Testing-303530541.html|title=Regulators Question Hunters Point Radiation Testing|website=NBC Bay Area|access-date=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1158">In [[database]] design, a '''Persistent Object Identifier (POID)''' is a [[unique key|unique identifier]] of a record on a table, used as the [[primary key]].  Important characteristics of a POID are that it does not carry business information and are not generally exported or otherwise made visible to data users; as such a POID has many of the characteristics of a [[surrogate key]].  The only purpose of the POID is to act as the primary key on the table where it is defined and to be referenced as the [[foreign key]] by other tables.  Because POIDs, like surrogate keys, do not carry business information, they are immune to changes in the form or meaning of business data.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26980">{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
{{Vajrayana}}
The '''pointing-out instruction''' (''ngo sprod'') is the direct introduction to the [[rigpa|nature of mind]] in the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] lineages of  [[Mahamudra|Mahāmudrā]] and [[Dzogchen]]. In these traditions, a "root guru"{{refn|group=note|(S. ''mūlaguru'', {{bo|w=rtsa-ba'i bla-ma}} [[THL Simplified Phonetic Transcription]] ''tsawé lama''}} gives the "pointing-out instruction" in such a way that the disciple successfully recognizes the "nature of mind."

The tradition of conferring such instructions outside the context of formal [[empowerment (Vajrayana)|empowerment]] ({{lang-sa|abhiṣeka}}) is unique to the [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] lineages. Whether or not such instructions are valid without the formal empowerment has historically been a point of contention with the more conservative [[Gelug]] and [[Sakya]] lineages.  The pointing-out instruction is often equated with the fourth formal vajrayana empowerment.

==Terminology==

In the Mahāmudrā tradition, pointing-out instruction ({{bo|w=ngo sprod kyi gdams pa}} ''ngotrö kyi dampa'') is also referred to as "pointing out the nature of mind" ({{bo|w=sems kyi ngo sprod}} ''sem kyi ngotrö''), "pointing out transmission", or "introduction to the nature of mind".&lt;ref name="hayward106"&gt;Hayward (2008) p.106&lt;/ref&gt; In the Dzogchen tradition, the pointing out instructions are often called the “introduction to awareness” (''rig pa'i ngo sprod'', pronounced "rigpay notro")&lt;ref&gt;The Tibetan Tradition of the Great Perfection by Jean-Luc Achard (CNRS, Paris) pg 4 [https://www.scribd.com/doc/24054221/Achard-Jean-Luc-The-Tibetan-Tradition-of-the-Great-Perfection]&lt;/ref&gt; or "sems khrid," pronounced "sem tri".&lt;ref&gt;Germano, David F.

{{quote|[A] direct pointing out of the nature of mind, that is mind's simplicity and universality—all appearances arise within the mind and in that sense there is nothing ''other'' than mind, yet mind itself is emptiness, openness beyond concept."&lt;ref name="hayward106" /&gt;}}

In the Mahāmudrā tradition, the mind pointed out is called "ordinary mind" ({{bo|w=tha mal gyi shes pa}} ''tamel gyi shépa'', Sanskrit: *''prākṛita-jñana'').&lt;ref&gt;''Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism'' by Chögyam Trungpa. Shambhala Publications: 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-59030-639-0}} Page 68&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche]] explains, 
{{quote|From the Mahamudra point of view, the nature of our mind is completely enlightened right from the beginning, and it is known as ordinary mind. In this context, 'ordinary' does not refer to mundane consciousness—a mind that  is totally caught up in this world of [[Saṃsāra|Samsara]]. Ordinary mind refers to Mind that is not fabricated in any way. It is the natural or fundamental state of our mind, totally free from all conceptual elaborations. It is the best part of Mind. When we experience this ordinary Mind, we experience buddha Mind. It does not matter how our mind is manifesting. Whether our thoughts and emotions are positive, negative, or neutral—that mind, in its essence, is totally free from all dualistic fixations.&lt;ref&gt;"Pointing Out Ordinary Mind" by Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche. in ''Buddhadharma: The Practitioner's Quarterly''. Fall 2009 [http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/web-archive/2009/9/1/pointing-out-ordinary-mind.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the Dzogchen tradition, knowledge of the basis pointed out is called ''[[rigpa]]'' ({{bo|w=rig pa}}, Sanskrit: *''vidya'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpa.org/en/about-rigpa.html Description of the word's meaning by Sogyal Rinpoche] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501132909/http://www.rigpa.org/en/about-rigpa.html |date=2012-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the pointing-out instruction is referred to as "the empowerment of vajra wisdom,"&lt;ref&gt;''Wild Awakening: The Heart of Mahamudra and Dzogchen'' by Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche Shambhala: 2003. {{ISBN|1-59030-096-3}} pg34&lt;/ref&gt; "vajrayana transmission" or "esoteric transmission," although these terms can also be applied to formal abhiṣeka as well.

==Mahāmudrā==
As scholar David Jackson describes, the particular Kagyu tradition of pointing-out instruction outside the tantras was popularized, if not originated, by [[Gampopa]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the special Great Seal (''phyag rgya chen po: mahāmudrā'') teachings for which sGam-po-pa was best known was his so-called "introduction to the [nature of] Mind" (''sems kyi ngo sprod''), by which the disciple was led to confront and directly recognize the nature of his or her mind. sGam-po-pa is said to have given such Great Seal instructions sometimes not as secret Vajrayana precepts in connection with initiation and special yogic practices, but rather as a Sūtra-based Great Seal instruction, or even as a doctrine going beyond both Sūtra and Tantra. Later critics such as Sa-skya Paṇḍita (or Sa-paṇ, as he was known for short) maintained, however, that all true Great Seal instructions were Mantrayana teachings that necessitated full, formal Tantric initiation into a maṇḍala. These masters denied in general the existence of any Sūtra-based or non-Tantric Great Seal, and in particular they considered the existence of any Mahāyāna doctrine outside the classes of Pāramitāyāna and Mantrayāna to be impossible.&lt;ref&gt;''Enlightenment By A Single: Means Tibetan Controversies on the "Self-Sufficient White Remedy" (dkar po chig thub)'' by David Jackson. VERLAG DER OSTERREICHISCHEN AKADEMIE DER WISSENSCHAFFEN. Vienna: 1994 {{ISBN|3-7001-2162-8}} pg &lt;sup&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/23509786/Enlightenment-by-a-Single-Means-Tibetan-Controversies-on-the-Self-Sufficient-White-Remedy]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jackson reports that, according to a number of Kagyu historians, Gampopa put particular emphasis on pointing out the nature of Mind. Jackson writes 
{{quote|rJe sGam-po-pa had discovered within himself the treasure of innate wisdom, and for him it was also essential to try to convey it to others. And convey it he did, on a scale never before attempted within his lineage. To do so, he bent the traditional rules restricting how certain Vajrayana teachings could be transmitted. He did this out of compassion for his students, in order to establish them in what was most important: profound meditative practice and insight."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson pg 14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is evidence that this practice derived from (unacknowledged) [[Zen#Ch.C3.A1n in China|Chan]] influence, a controversial issue in Tibet. As scholar Matthew Kapstein writes, the 
{{quote|... much contested doctrine sometimes called the 'mahamudra of the sutra tradition' (mdo-lugs phyag-chen) [...] was said to bring about direct insight into the ultimate nature of Mind, owing to the impact of an 'introduction' (ngo-sprod; see chapter 10) conferred by one's teacher, without the disciple's having first traversed the entire sequence of tantric initiation and yogic practice [...] &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Gampopa and other Kagyüpa teachers&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; certainly wished to avoid suggesting that what they were teaching was a rehashing of the Chinese Chan doctrine, which after all had been condemned in the Kadampa tradition of the eleventh-century teacher Potowa (1027 or 1031–1105), a tradition with which Gampopa was himself closely affiliated.&lt;br&gt;This ploy, however, was not fully successful. Sakya Paṇḍita (1182–1251), for one, recognized very clearly that the Kagyüpa teaching drew some of its inspiration from such sources, and so he castigated its 'sutra tradition of the mahamudra' as what he termed, with apparent derision, 'Chinese Great Perfection' (''Rgya-nag rdzogs-chen'')."&lt;ref&gt;"The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhism: Conversion, Contestation, and Memory" by Matthew T. Kapstein. Oxford University Press, USA {{ISBN|0-19-513122-3}} pg 77&lt;/ref&gt;}}

How much of a departure this in fact represented from the Indian model has been a subject of ongoing research. As scholar Klaus-Dieter Mathes has found:
{{quote|Certain aspects of the Bka´ brgyud teachings on mahāmudrā, such as the possibility of a sudden liberating realization or the possibility that a beginner may attain mahāmudrā even without Tantric initiation, became a highly controversial issue in the 13th century. For Sa skya Paṇḍita (1182–1251), such teachings represented a new development stemming from a Sino-Tibetan influence on Sgam po pa Bsod nams rin chen (1079–1153). Later Bka´ brgyud pas defended their not specifically Tantric or sūtra mahāmudrā tradition by adducing Indian sources such as the Tattvadaśakaṭīkā or the Tattvāvatāra. These belong to a genre of literature which the Seventh Karmapa Chos grags rgya mtsho (1454–1506) called “Indian mahāmudrā-Works” (phyag chen rgya gzhung) [...] Dr. Mathes investigated the practice described in these mahāmudrā works and found that it is not necessarily Tantric. In Saraha´s dohās it is simply the realization of Mind´s co-emergent nature with the help of a genuine guru. [[Maitripa|Maitrīpa]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Maitripa&lt;/ref&gt; (ca. 1007– ca. 1085) uses the term mahāmudrā for precisely such an approach, thus employing an originally Tantric term for something that is not a specifically Tantric practice. It is thus legitimate for later Bka´ brgyud pas to speak of Saraha´s mahāmudrā tradition as being originally independent of the Sūtras and the Tantras. For Maitrīpa, the direct realization of emptiness (or the co-emergent) is the bridging link between the Sūtras and the Tantras, and it is thanks to this bridge that Mahāmudrā can be linked to the Sūtras and the Tantras. In the Sūtras it takes the form of the practice of non-abiding and becoming mentally disengaged, while in the Tantras it occupies a special position among the four mudrās.&lt;ref&gt;"Indian Mahāmudrā-Works” in the Early Bka’ brgyud pa." Centre for Tantric Studies website. {{cite web |url=http://www.tantric-studies.org/projects/indian-mahamudra-in-early-kagyu/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820095822/http://www.tantric-studies.org/projects/indian-mahamudra-in-early-kagyu/ |archivedate=2008-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to scholar Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche Sherpa, introduction (''ngo sprod'') 
{{quote|... is explained by Gampopa as being of five types:&lt;br&gt;1) introduction of appearance as mind through the analogy of sleep and dream,&lt;br&gt;2) introduction of the inseparability of appearance and emptiness through the analogy of water and ice,&lt;br&gt;3) introduction of mind-as-such as empty through the analogy of empty sky,&lt;br&gt;4) introduction of multiplicity as being one taste through the analogy of the taste of a cake of raw sugar."&lt;ref&gt;"Gampopa, the Monk and the Yogi: His Life and Teachings." by Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche Sherpa. PhD dissertation, Harvard:2004 pg 175&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Trungram notes that Gampopa uses 
{{quote|"terms we find in the Mahāmudrā instruction of Saraha, Maitrīpa, and sometimes Tillipa. But his actual instruction is marked by one major difference: Gampopa ignores the methodical mantric path we find in his predecessors" and "taught openly in public, without testing the spiritual capacity of his students [...] the permissibility of teaching Gampopa's Mahāmudrā to the masses . . . lead us to view his publicly taught Mahāmudrā as a sutra teaching."&lt;ref&gt;Trungram pg 176&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The mahāmudrā tradition also includes a "fourfold pointing-out instructions" (pointing out the nature of Mind on the basis of appearances) presented by Karmapa [[Wangchuk Dorje]] in his three texts on mahāmudrā.

==Dzogchen==
{{see also|Direct Introduction}}
In the Dzogchen tradition, the pointing out instructions are more often called the “introduction to awareness” (''rig pa'i ngo sprod'', pronounced "rigpay notro")&lt;ref&gt;"The Tibetan Tradition of the Great Perfection" by Jean-Luc Achard (CNRS, Paris) pg 4&lt;sup&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/24054221/Achard-Jean-Luc-The-Tibetan-Tradition-of-the-Great-Perfection]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or "direct introduction" (Tibetan: ངོ་སྤྲོད་སྤྲས་པ, Wylie: ''ngo sprod spras pa'', literally "directly encountering one's own state"). The "Empowerment of Awareness" ({{bo|w=rig pa'i rtsal dbang}}, pronounced "rigpay sall wahng") is a technical term employed within the Dzogchen lineages for a particular lineage of empowerment propagated by [[Jigme Lingpa]]. This empowerment consists of the direct introduction of the student to the intrinsic nature of their own mind-essence, [[rigpa]], by their empowering master.&lt;ref name="DharmaFellowship"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dharmafellowship.org/biographies/historicalsaints/pramodavajra.htm |title=Biographies: Pramodavajra, Regent of the Divine|accessdate=2007-11-15 |work=Dharma Fellowship of His Holiness the Gwayala Karmapa|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albion Moonlight Butters notes, 
{{quote|Students of ''rDzogs chen'' are repeatedly reminded of the inherent perfection of the beginningless beginning. The primary purpose of the guru's pointing out instructions--be they verbal or symbolic or telepathic--is to provide a taste of this, to introduce the student to his or her own natural awareness. From there, one needs only to sustain that way of being (''gnas lugs''), deepening the experience until all things have that unitary taste (''ro gcig'').&lt;ref&gt;The Doxographical Genius of Kunmkhyen kLong chen rab 'byams pa. by Albion Moonlight Butters. PhD dissertation, Columbia: 2006 pg 267&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Sogyal Rinpoche]] describes the pointing out instructions given by Patrul Rinpoche to Nyoshul Lungtok:
:Nyoshul Lungtok, who later became one of the greatest Dzogchen masters of recent times, followed his teacher Patrul Rinpoche for about eighteen years. During all that time, they were almost inseparable. Nyoshul Lungtok studied and practiced extremely diligently, and accumulated a wealth of purification, merit, and practice; he was ready to recognize the Rigpa, but had not yet had the final introduction. Then, one famous evening, Patrul Rinpoche gave him the introduction. It happened when they were staying together in one of the hermitages high up in the mountains above Dzogchen Monastery. It was a very beautiful night. The dark blue sky was clear and the stars shone brilliantly. The sound of their solitude was heightened by the distant barking of a dog from the monastery below. Patrul Rinpoche was lying stretched out on the ground, doing a special Dzogchen practice. He called Nyoshul Lungtok over to him, saying: "Did you say you do not know the essence of Mind?" Nyoshul Lungtok guessed from his tone that this was a special moment and nodded expectantly.

:"There's nothing to it really," Patrul Rinpoche said casually, and added, "My son, come and lie down over here: be like your old father." Nyoshul Lungtok stretched out by his side. Then Patrul Rinpoche asked him, "Do you see the stars up there in the sky?"
:"Yes."
:"Do you hear the dogs barking in Dzogchen Monastery?"
:"Yes."
:"Do you hear what I'm saying to you?"
:"Yes."
:"Well, the nature of Dzogchen is this: simply this."
:Nyoshul Lungtok tells us what happened then: "At that instant, I arrived at a certainty of realization from within. I had been liberated from the fetters of 'it is' and 'it is not.' I had realized the primordial wisdom, the naked union of emptiness and intrinsic awareness. I was introduced to this realization by his blessing, as the great Indian master Saraha said: He in whose heart the words of the master have entered, Sees the truth like a treasure in his own palm."&lt;ref&gt;The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying: Revised and Updated Edition. by Sogyal Rinpoche (Author), Patrick D. Gaffney (Editor), Andrew Harvey (Editor) HarperOne: 1994. {{ISBN|0-06-250834-2}} pg. 160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Effectivity==
According to Dzogchen master [[Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche]], 
{{quote|Once one has received the pointing-out instruction there is the chance of either recognizing it or not."&lt;ref&gt;Interview for ''Vajradhatu Sun'', 1985&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.rangjung.com/authors/tulku_urgyen_rinpoche-interview.htm]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bruce Newman, a long-time student of Tulku Urgyen's son, [[Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche]], describes the possible responses of the student to the pointing out instruction:

:So at this point one of two things may have happened: You've had some experience that you think or hope is the experience, or you haven't. If you haven't, you can report, "Rinpoche, I've been trying to meditate on what you said when you said, 'Mind is empty.' But nothing has happened. I don't understand{{mdash}}I have no idea what you're talking about! Can you give me one word of advice on how to proceed?" Then you take that advice and start all over. A word of caution: he may not answer you straight away. He might say that you have to do some other practice, such as the preliminary practices, to clear away obstacles to your understanding. Complete these practices to his satisfaction then report back for further clarification and instruction, for however long it takes. At this point you'll know that your practice is proceeding in the right direction.

:If you had some experience, report back for confirmation. Don't assume you've understood. There are countless ways to get it wrong, and if you do, it will make the rest of your practice wobbly, since it will based on a wrong view. It would be like building a house on a rotten foundation.

:When you report back, you can say, "Rinpoche, in your teaching you said that Mind was empty. Since then I've been trying to meditate on your words and I've had the following experience..." It's very difficult to put these kinds of experiences into words, but please try; it's really worth the effort. Study helps here{{mdash}}it provides you with the vocabulary to explain yourself. So you might ask, "Is this really it?" He might ask you several questions, often to discern whether you're talking about a real experience or mostly mixing it up with what you've read or heard. If he says "no," "not quite," etc., then you go back to the beginning. If it's a definite "yes," then ask for further clarification, some instruction on how to proceed. Even if you have recognized and your teacher has unequivocally confirmed your recognition, there's still much more to learn. First are the techniques for repeating and stabilizing the recognition. (This is, of course, many lifetimes of work!) Second, there will be doubts, and you'll have experiences you're not sure how to categorize. "Was that last experience really rigpa? Perhaps it wasn't empty enough." This can go on for a long time. The doubting and questioning can start to become problematic after a while, but it's very necessary in the beginning to make sure you have it right.&lt;ref&gt;''A Beginner's Guide To Tibetan Buddhism'' by Bruce Newman. Snow Lion Publications. 1559392118&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.snowlionpub.com/pages/N66_5.html]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Orgyen Tobgyal Rinpoche, few contemporary disciples are capable of recognition, even when receiving pointing out instructions from superior masters:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once I witnessed Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche give the pointing out instruction to a gathering of more than one thousand people in Taiwan. He still gave the real thing nakedly and directly, leaving nothing out. This must exemplify what they call the 'expression of compassionate capacity,' for he rose to the occasion out of the power of his realization. He said, 'The oral instruction is like a candle: you can see while you hold it, and when you give it away you have no more light. But since all of you have taken the trouble to come here, expecting to hear me speak, I feel that I cannot refuse giving you the pointing-out instruction.' Then he gave the instruction in coming face to face with your own nature. Even if the great Khyentse, Kongtrül or Longchenpa were doing so, it wouldn't surpass his instruction. Yet I later met only a few there who truly recognized their own nature. Even among Rinpoche's Western students there were some very close disciples who definitely should have recognized their buddha nature. They probably had some vague glimpse of recognition; yet they use empty words, and ignore the consequences of their actions. I have yet to meet one who has fully realized his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Kyabje Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche: Essays and interviews by ten lamas surrounding the passing of a great master&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.gomde.dk/pages/interviews/turgyen/9-lamas.htm#8 Spoken by Orgyen Tobgyal Rinpoche]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche characterizes recognition as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Receiving pointing-out instructions is similar to watching a movie preview. Unless we see the preview, we have no idea what the movie will be about. So a preview is an excellent way to be introduced to what a particular movie might be like. We might see the preview and then decide to skip the film{{mdash}}that is up to us. No one is going to force us to sit through the whole movie.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Similarly, we get a preview of the Mahamudra experience when we receive the pointing-out instructions from our guru. They give us a glimpse or flash experience of Mahamudra. They give us a sense of direction and motivate us to go further; however, it is up to us to extend our exploration so that we eventually come to a genuine realization of Mahamudra. Without this flash experience, we would have no way to be exposed to the nature of Mind so directly, so nakedly. That flash is a transmission of the lineage, a wonderful blessing through which we are introduced to the deeper experience and realization of the Mahamudra path. This shows how necessary it is to rely on the lineage transmission and to be connected to a genuine lineage master. Without the pure and genuine lineage, without a qualified lineage master, we would have no way to experience such a preview, such a flash experience.&lt;ref&gt;"Pointing Out Ordinary Mind" by Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche. in ''Buddhadharma: The Practitioner's Quarterly''. Fall 2009&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2009/fall/ordinary.php]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Secrecy==
This conspicuous aspect of Vajrayana Buddhism is [[esoteric]].  In this context esoteric means that the transmission of certain accelerating factors only occurs directly from teacher to student during an initiation and cannot be simply learned from a book. The term [[adhisthana]] (literally "blessing") refers to the spiritual energy that is received in the [[mindstream]] of the aspirant when successful transmission takes place.

Many techniques are also commonly said to be secret, but some Vajrayana teachers have responded that the secrecy itself is not important but only a side-effect of the reality that the techniques have no validity outside the teacher-student lineage.  As these techniques are said to be highly effective, when not practiced properly, the practitioner can be harmed physically and mentally. In order to avoid these kind of dangers, the practice is kept secret.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

According to the Dalai Lama in the "Tradition of Mahamudra":&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/e-books/published_books/gelug_kagyu_mahamudra/pt4/mm_15.html Gelug-Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Kagyu system refers to those who manifest clear light mind by relying on the methods for penetrating vital points of the external and internal body as those who progress through graded stages of methods. Such practitioners manifest clear light mind by progressing through stages. Those with sharp faculties, however, may be practitioners for whom everything happens at once. The Nyingma tradition of dzogchen also distinguishes between these two types of practitioners. Those who manifest rigpa, pure awareness, by training through stages involving various practices with the energy-winds, tummo, and so forth are those who progress through graded stages, while those for whom everything happens at once achieve the same by relying solely on meditation on a nonconceptual state of mental consciousness without the practices of the energy channels and energy-winds.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to one Kagyu text, the method of practice of those for whom everything happens at once is powerful medicine. But it is deadly poison for those who progress through graded stages. In other words, the method of practice of meditating solely on the nonconceptual state of the mind is suited only for those of sharpest faculties. For those who are not of their level, such practice brings only harm, no benefit. For them the medicine acts like a poison.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Kaydrub Norzang-gyatso, in ''A Lamp for Clarifying Mahamudra to Establish the Single Intention of the Kagyu and Gelug Traditions'', has explained that those for whom everything happens at once are persons who have trained extensively through stages either in previous lives or earlier in this life. As a result, meditation on the nonconceptual state of the mind, without need to rely on any further meditation on penetrating vital points of the vajra-body, alone causes clear light mind to manifest so that everything happens at once. Such meditation does this by acting as a circumstance for triggering the ripening of potentials built up from previous practice with energy-winds and so forth, so that they automatically enter, abide and dissolve in the central energy-channel. If a practitioner has not built up these potentials, then no matter how intensively he or she may focus in a nonconceptual state of mind, this person is unable to manifest clear light mind or pure awareness. They lack sufficient causes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Satellite image of Noordoostpolder, Netherlands (5.78E 52.71N).png|thumb|right|[[Satellite imagery|Satellite image]] of [[Noordoostpolder]], [[Netherlands]] (595.41&amp;nbsp;km²)]] 

A '''polder''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈpɔldər|-|Nl-polder.ogg}}) is a low-lying tract of land enclosed by [[dike (construction)|dikes]] that form an artificial [[hydrology|hydrological]] entity, meaning it has no connection with outside water other than through manually operated devices. There are three types of polder:
# [[Land reclamation|Land reclaimed]] from a body of water, such as a lake or the [[sea|sea bed]]
# [[Flood plain]]s separated from the sea or river by a dike
# [[Marshes]] separated from the surrounding water by a dike and subsequently drained; these are also known as ''[[koog]]s'' especially in Germany

The ground level in drained marshes [[Subsidence|subsides]] over time. All polders will eventually be below the surrounding water level some or all of the time. Water enters the low-lying polder through [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] and water pressure of [[ground water]], or rainfall, or transport of water by rivers and canals. This usually means that the polder has an excess of water, which is pumped out or drained by opening [[sluice]]s at [[low tide]]. Care must be taken not to set the internal water level too low. Polder land made up of [[peat]] (former marshland) will sink in relation to its previous level, because of peat decomposing when exposed to oxygen from the air. 
 
Polders are at risk from flooding at all times, and care must be taken to protect the surrounding dikes. Dikes are typically built with locally available materials, and each material has its own risks: sand is prone to collapse owing to saturation by water; dry peat is lighter than water and potentially unable to retain water in very dry seasons. Some animals dig tunnels in the barrier, allowing water to infiltrate the structure; the [[muskrat]] is known for this activity and hunted in certain European countries because of it. Polders are most commonly, though not exclusively, found in river deltas, former [[fen]]lands and coastal areas.

Flooding of polders has also been used as a military tactic in the past. One example is the flooding of the polders along the [[Yser]] river during [[World War I]]. Opening the sluices at high tide and closing them at low tide turned the polders into an inaccessible swamp which allowed the Allied armies to stop the German army.

==Etymology==
From [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''polder'' ("polder"), from [[Middle Dutch]] ''polre'', from [[Old Dutch]] ''polra'', ultimately from ''pol-'' "part of land, elevated above its surroundings"; with [[augmentative]] suffix ''-er'' and [[Epenthesis|epenthetical]] '' -d-''.

==Polders and the Netherlands==

The [[Netherlands]] is frequently associated with polders, as its engineers became noted for developing techniques to drain wetlands and make them usable for agriculture and other development. This is illustrated by the saying: "God created the world, but the Dutch created the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=3HjRCwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=origin+of+phrase+%22God+created+the+world%2C+but+the+Dutch+created+the+Netherlands%22.&amp;q=%22God+created+the+world%2C+but+the+Dutch+created+the+Netherlands%22.#v=snippet&amp;q=%22God%20created%20the%20world%2C%20but%20the%20Dutch%20created%20the%20Netherlands%22.&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;". 

The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] have a long history of reclamation of marshes and fenland, resulting in some 3,000 ''polders''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl/rws/waterinnovatiebron/cgi-bin/toonlijst.pl?config=config&amp;var=volgnr&amp;val=1&amp;layout=index-forceframe&amp;confignr=1&amp;menu=1067260347&amp;menuitem=1120115781| publisher=Rijkswaterstaat| title=''Kijk naar de geschiedenis''| accessdate=2008-01-21}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; nationwide. By 1961 {{convert|6800|sqmi}}, about half of the country's land, was reclaimed from the sea.&lt;ref name="ley196110"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half the total surface area of ''polders'' in north-west Europe is in the Netherlands. The first [[embankment dam|embankments]] in Europe were constructed in Roman times. The first polders were constructed in the 11th century. 

As a result of flooding disasters, [[Water board (The Netherlands)|water board]]s called ''waterschap'' (when situated more inland) or ''hoogheemraadschap'' (near the sea, mainly used in the [[Holland]] region)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=waterschap|url = http://www.waterschappen.nl/mijn-waterschap.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102142234/http://www.waterschappen.nl/|archivedate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; were set up to maintain the integrity of the water defences around polders, maintain the waterways inside a polder, and control the various water levels inside and outside the polder. Water boards hold separate elections, levy taxes, and function independently from other government bodies. Their function is basically unchanged even today. As such they are the oldest democratic institution in the country. The necessary cooperation among all ranks to maintain polder integrity gave its name to the Dutch version of [[Third Way (centrism)|third way politics]]—the ''[[Polder Model]]''.

The [[North Sea flood of 1953|1953 flood disaster]] prompted a new approach to the design of dikes and other water-retaining structures, based on an acceptable probability of overflowing. Risk is defined as the product of probability and consequences. The potential damage in lives, property and rebuilding costs is compared to the potential cost of water defences. From these calculations follows an acceptable flood risk from the sea at one in 4,000–10,000&amp;nbsp;years, while it is one in 100–2,500&amp;nbsp;years for a river flood. The particular established policy guides the Dutch government to improve flood defences as new data on threat levels becomes available. 

Some famous Dutch polders and the year they were laid dry are:
* [[Beemster]] (1609-1612)
* [[Schermer]] (1633-1635)
* [[Haarlemmermeerpolder]] (1852)
* As part of the [[Zuiderzee Works]]:
** [[Wieringermeerpolder]] (1930)
** [[Noordoostpolder]] (1942)
** [[Flevopolder]] (1956-1966)

== Examples of polders ==
===Bangladesh===
Bangladesh has 123 polders, of which 49 are sea-facing. These were constructed in the 1960s to protect the coast from tidal flooding and reduce salinity incursion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report/98292/bangladesh-polders-under-threat "Bangladesh polders under threat"], Irin News&lt;/ref&gt; They reduce long-term flooding and waterlogging following [[storm surge]]s from [[tropical cyclone]]s. They are also cultivated for agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unearthnews.org/2013/07/17/bangladeshi-project-to-enhance-polders-amidst-climate-woes/ "Bangladeshi project to enhance polders amidst climate woes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408091108/http://unearthnews.org/2013/07/17/bangladeshi-project-to-enhance-polders-amidst-climate-woes/ |date=2014-04-08 }}, Unearth News&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' provides that any named [[taxon]] in the family group, genus group, or species group have a [[name-bearing type]] which allows the name of the taxon to be objectively applied. The type does not define the taxon: that is done by a taxonomist; and an indefinite number of competing definitions can exist side by sided . Rather, a type is a point of reference.  A name has a type, and a taxonomist (having defined the taxon) can determine which existing types fall within the scope of the taxon. He or she can then use the rules in the Code to determine the [[valid name (zoology)|valid name]] for the taxon.

[[Image:ProofRefute.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Cover of ''Proofs and Refutations'' by [[Imre Lakatos]].]]
'''''Proofs and Refutations''''' is a 1976 book by philosopher [[Imre Lakatos]] expounding his view of the progress of [[mathematics]]. The book is written as a series of [[Socratic dialogue]]s involving a group of students who debate the proof of the [[Euler characteristic]] defined for the [[polyhedron]]. A central theme is that [[definition]]s are not carved in stone, but often have to be patched up in the light of later insights, in particular failed [[Mathematical proof|proof]]s. This gives mathematics a somewhat experimental flavour. At the end of the Introduction, Lakatos explains that his purpose is to challenge [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism in mathematics]], and to show that [[informal mathematics]] grows by a logic of "proofs and refutations".

==Synopsis==
Many important logical ideas are explained in the book. For example, the difference between a [[counterexample]] to a [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] (a so-called 'local counterexample') and a counterexample to the specific conjecture under attack (a 'global counterexample' to the Euler characteristic, in this case) is discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lakatos|1976|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lakatos argues for a different kind of textbook, one that uses heuristic style. To the critics that say such a textbook would be too long, he replies: 'The answer to this pedestrian argument is: let us try.'

The book includes two appendices.  In the first, Lakatos gives examples of the heuristic process in mathematical discovery.  In the second, he contrasts the deductivist and heuristic approaches and provides heuristic analysis of some 'proof generated' concepts, including [[uniform convergence]], [[bounded variation]], and the [[Outer measure|Carathéodory definition]] of a measurable set.

The pupils in the book are named after letters of the Greek alphabet.

== Method ==

Though the book is written as a narrative, an actual method of investigation, that of "proofs and refutations", is developed. In Appendix I, Lakatos summarizes this method by the following list of stages:

# Primitive conjecture.
# Proof (a rough thought-experiment or argument, decomposing the primitive conjecture into subconjectures).
# "Global" counterexamples (counterexamples to the primitive conjecture) emerge.
# Proof re-examined: the "guilty lemma" to which the global counter-example is a "local" counterexample is spotted. This guilty lemma may have previously remained "hidden" or may have been misidentified. Now it is made explicit, and built into the primitive conjecture as a condition. The theorem - the improved conjecture - supersedes the primitive conjecture with the new proof-generated concept as its paramount new feature.

He goes on and gives further stages that might sometimes take place:

&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proofs of other theorems are examined to see if the newly found lemma or the new proof-generated concept occurs in them: this concept may be found lying at cross-roads of different proofs, and thus emerge as of basic importance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hitherto accepted consequences of the original and now refuted conjecture are checked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Counterexamples are turned into new examples - new fields of inquiry open up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==Publication history==
The 1976 book has been translated into more than 15 languages worldwide, including Chinese, Korean, Serbo-Croat and Turkish, and went into its second Chinese edition in 2007.

==Impact on teaching==
A number of mathematics teachers have implemented Lakatos' method of proofs and refutations in the classroom, when teaching other mathematical topics.&lt;ref&gt;Fatih Karakus &amp; Mesut Bütün; ''Examining the Method of Proofs and Refutations in Pre-Service Teachers Education'', Bolema vol. 27 no.45 Rio Claro Apr. 2013.[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0103-636X2013000100011&amp;script=sci_arttext]&lt;/ref&gt; The method has been applied to the analysis and presentation  of problem  solving in mechanics

&lt;/score&gt;|width=280|caption=An example of rehearsal letters}}A '''rehearsal letter''' is a boldface letter of the [[alphabet]] in an [[orchestra]]l [[Sheet music|score]], and its corresponding parts, that provides the [[conducting|conductor]], who typically leads rehearsals, with a convenient spot to begin at places other than the start of movements or pieces. Rehearsal letters are most often used in scores of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]] and onwards, beginning with [[Louis Spohr]]. 

==Terminology==
They may also be generically called '''rehearsal marks'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://usermanuals.finalemusic.com/FinaleMac/Content/Finale/Rehearsal_letters.htm|title=Rehearsal marks|website=usermanuals.finalemusic.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://musescore.org/en/handbook/rehearsal-marks|title=Rehearsal marks {{!}} MuseScore|website=musescore.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''rehearsal figures''',&lt;ref&gt;Del Mar&lt;/ref&gt; or, when numbers are used instead of letters, '''rehearsal numbers'''.

== Purpose ==

In the course of rehearsing a symphony or piece, it is often necessary for the conductor to stop and go back to some point in the middle, in order to master the more difficult passages or sections, or to resolve a challenge that the ensemble is having. Many scores and parts have [[bar (music)|bar]] numbers, every five or ten bars, or at the beginning of each page or line. But as pieces and individual movements of works became longer (extending to several hundred bars) as the Romantic era progressed, bar numbers became less practical in rehearsal.

[[Image:RehLetterXamp_fromFullScore.png|300px|thumb|right|From a page in the full score of [[Christoph Graupner]]'s Symphony in D major, Nagel 75. If the conductor wants to resume rehearsal from the second measure shown here, he could either say "measure 21" or "letter A".]]

For example, a conductor can tell their musicians to resume at bar 387, so that the musicians have to find the nearest bar number in their parts (e.g. 385 or 390) and count back or forward a couple of measures. Even if the number 387 is written at the appropriate bar, it might not particularly stand out. But if there is, for example, a big, bold letter M in the score and parts, it is much easier for the conductor to just say "begin at letter M". Even if the conductor were to say "one bar before letter M", that would still be more convenient than saying "bar 386". Alternatively the conductor could first say "before M..." and allow the players time to find M and then say "one bar".&lt;ref&gt;J. V. Horn ''The Community Orchestra'' Greenwood Press, 1979 p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

In the score of a full orchestra, rehearsal letters are typically placed over the [[flute]]s' (or [[piccolo]]'s) staff, and duplicated above the first [[violin]]s' staff. For concert bands, rehearsal letters are placed over the piccolo's staff (or flutes'), and over the [[trumpet]]s'.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Nicholl &amp; Richard Grudzinski, ''Music Notation: Preparing Scores and Parts'', ed. Jonathan Feist. Boston: Berklee Press (2007): 46. "Rehearsal marks appear above the top staff in most scores. In large scores, rehearsal marks can also appear in a second place, usually in the middle of the system or above each choir."&lt;/ref&gt; Rehearsal letters should appear in every part, but the conductor or librarian should check this and also make sure that they agree with the conductor's score; if they do not, the letters from the parts should be copied to the conductor's score.&lt;ref&gt;Horn, 1979, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; For typical pieces or movements of the Romantic era marked [[allegro (music)|allegro]], the letters A to Z can be used up, though the letters I, J or O (or all) may be skipped.

Placement and frequency of the letters do not follow a hard-and-fast rule. Generally they are inserted at places where there is a musically significant change, for example a new theme, or a change in dynamic or instrumentation or the start of a new section – just those places where a conductor might want to restart in rehearsal. In addition, having the letters coincide with musical signposts can help players who are counting rests confirm they are still in the right place, which would not be possible if the marks were placed at numerically regular intervals.

The letter A is almost always used for a point close to the beginning, but not for the very beginning itself because it is much easier to say "from the beginning". Likewise, rehearsal letters are not necessary at changes in [[tempo]], [[key signature]] or [[time signature]], as the name of the new tempo or signature can serve the same purpose. For example, in some editions of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]], letter A of the Finale does not occur until bar 140, when the relatively late entry of the first violins with the "[[Ode to Joy]]" theme might not stand out enough to the other players to be a convenient point of reference, whereas the reminiscences of the previous movements' themes are more easily referenced by their tempo markings.

If the conductor says to resume playing from measure 21, the bassoonist has to count from measure 18, or count backwards from measure 23. But if the conductor says to resume from letter A, the bassoonist needs only find the letter A in his or her part.]]

A rehearsal letter usually breaks a [[multimeasure rest]] in a part (except in cases where a given instrument does not play at all in a given movement of the work). Because rehearsal letters are sometimes independent of edition and in some cases even version, they are also useful for telling applicants for positions in the orchestra what passages they need to play at the [[audition (performing arts)|audition]]. They are also useful for easy reference in scholarly essays about orchestral works. However, rehearsal letters are altogether absent from some editions of some pieces that have them in other editions, such as the older editions of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Meistersinger]]'' prelude.&lt;ref&gt;Del Mar&lt;/ref&gt;

Rehearsal letters are less useful in unaccompanied instrumental music such as the solo [[piano]] repertoire (although they may be used in duets), since the instrumentalist has no need to communicate to a fellow player where to resume playing. Songs also tend not to use them, because it is more useful to refer to the [[lyrics]] (except in pieces where the lyrics are highly repetitive, or those with long lyric-less sections).

== Usage in the late 19th century to 21st century ==

In some cases, A to Z might not be enough. After Z, Aa may be used, followed by Bb, and so on until Zz (though Ii, Jj and/or Oo might also be skipped). The Wilhelm Hansen edition of [[Jean Sibelius]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Sibelius)|Symphony No. 7 in C major]] presents one unusual case: the letters A to Z (including both I and J) are used up with just three more pages left in the score. For the final flute and bassoon solo, the editors use [[Ö]] (the final letter of the [[Finnish alphabet]]) as a rehearsal letter.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}{{Image frame|content=&lt;score&gt;  \relative c'' {

  b1 \mark \default

}
&lt;/score&gt;|width=280|caption=Boxed rehearsal numbers}}But in the case of some composers, such as [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], twice through the alphabet might still not be enough. For this reason, some editors prefer rehearsal numbers to rehearsal letters. Mahler's and Shostakovich's scores use rehearsal numbers rather than letters. These are typically in [[boldface]] and enclosed in a box, or less commonly, a circle. Confusingly, however, some editions enclose bar numbers in boxes, though usually not in bold. In the Schirmer edition of [[Roy Harris]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Harris)|Symphony No. 3]] (in one movement), the rehearsal numbers are enclosed in circles, and they occur every ten measures, actually being the bar number divided by 10. That rehearsal numbers "are easily confused with measure numbers" is a reason sometimes given in favor of rehearsal letters.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Stone. ''Music Notation in the Twentieth Century: A Practical Guidebook'' (New York &amp; London, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1980), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of rehearsal numbers counter that even 26 letters are not enough for some scores. Whereas rehearsal letters reset to A for each movement of a multi-movement work (even for connected movements), rehearsal numbers typically run over the course of the entire work, even if the movements are not connected. For example, the rehearsal number for the last few bars of the first movement of [[Edward Elgar]]'s [[Symphony No. 1 (Elgar)|First Symphony]] is 55; the first rehearsal number of the second movement is 56. There are exceptions, however. The final outburst in the first movement of Mahler's [[Symphony No. 2 (Mahler)|Second Symphony]] is rehearsal number 27. Mahler actually wanted a pause of five minutes before the next movement, so the rehearsal numbers reset to 1, ending with 15. The third movement follows after a short break, but its first rehearsal number is 28.&lt;ref&gt;Mahler, Gustav. ''Symphonies Nos. 1 and 2 in Full Score'', Dover, {{ISBN|0-486-25473-9}} (1987) pp. 224-225, 248.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Jazz and pop===
For jazz and pop compositions with several choruses, "many jazz composers and arrangers" use a format in which "each successive verse/chorus part of the form is assigned successive letters of the alphabet" combined with a measure number: for example, letter A for the first 8-bar phrase of the verse after the introduction, A9 for the next 8-bar phrase, A17, A25, then B, B9, B17, B25 for the chorus, etc., with the special rehearsal marking TAG for the [[tag ending]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholl &amp; Grudzinski (2007): 45&lt;/ref&gt; In jazz and pop music, the musicians frequently refer to the "A section" or the "B section" of a [[32 bar song]] during rehearsals. In pop music, the music is commonly organized into standard sections, such as an [[introduction (music)|intro]], multiple [[verse (popular music)|verse]]s and [[chorus (song)|chorus]]es (refrain), one or more [[bridge (music)|bridge]]s, a [[guitar solo]] (or other instrumental solos), and an [[outro (music)|outro]]s. As such, a [[bandleader]] who wishes to start in the middle of a song will typically specify which part of this structure the band should start on (e.g., "last four bars of the bridge, going into the guitar solo" or "last verse and go to the outro").

{{sociology}}
The '''sociology of race and ethnic relations''' is the study of [[social]], [[political]], and [[economic]] relations between [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] and [[ethnicities]] at all levels of [[society]]. This area encompasses the study of systemic [[racism]], like [[residential segregation]] and other complex social processes between different racial and ethnic groups. The sociological analysis of race and ethnicity frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as, but not limited to, [[Social stratification|stratification]] and [[Social psychology (sociology)|social psychology]], as well as with [[postcolonial theory]].

At the level of political policy, ethnic relations is discussed in terms of either [[assimilationism]] or [[multiculturalism]]. [[Anti-racism]] forms another style of policy, particularly popular in the 1960s and 1970s.  At the level of academic inquiry, ethnic relations is discussed either by the experiences of individual racial-ethnic groups or else by overarching theoretical issues.

==Classical Theorists==

===Marx===

[[Marx]] described society as having nine "great" classes, the capitalist class and the working class, with the middle classes falling in behind one or the other as they see fit. He hoped for the working class to rise up against the capitalist class in an attempt to stop the exploitation of the working class. He blamed part of their failure to organize on the capitalist class, as they separated black and white laborers. This separation, specifically between Blacks and Whites in America,  contributed to racism. Marx attributes [[capitalism]]'s contribution to racism through segmented labor markets and a racial inequality of earnings.&lt;ref name="Bohmer"&gt;Bohmer, Peter. 1998. [http://academic.evergreen.edu/b/bohmerp/marxracism.html    Marxist Theory of Racism and Racial Inequality].  Readings in Black Political Economy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weber===
[[Weber]] laid the foundations for a micro-sociology of ethnic relations beginning in 1906.  Weber argued that biological traits could not be the basis for group foundation unless they were conceived as shared characteristics. It was this shared perception and common customs that create and distinguish one ethnicity from another.  This differs from the views of many of his contemporaries who believed that an ethnic group was formed from biological similarities alone apart from social perception of membership in a group.&lt;ref name="Banton"&gt;Banton, Michael. 2008. The Sociology of Ethnic Relations. ''Ethnic and Racial Studies''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===W.E.B. Du Bois===
[[W.E.B. Du Bois]] is well known as one of the most influential black scholars and activists of the 20th century. Du Bois educated himself on his people, and sought academia as a way to enlighten others on the social injustices against his people. Du Bois research "revealed the [[Negro]] group as a symptom, not a cause; as a striving, palpitating group, and not an inert, sick body of crime; as a long historic development and not a transient occurrence".&lt;ref name="DuBois"&gt;Du Bois, W.E.B. 1940. Dusk of dawn; an essay toward an autobiography of a race concept. Schocken Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Du Bois believed that Black Americans should embrace higher education and use their new access to schooling to achieve a higher position within society. He referred to this idea as the [[Talented Tenth]]. With gaining popularity, he also preached the belief that for blacks to be free in some places, they must be free everywhere. After traveling to Africa and Russia, he recanted his original philosophy of integration and acknowledged it as a long term vision.&lt;ref name="Hynes"&gt;Hynes, Gerald. ????. [http://www.duboislc.org/html/DuBoisBio.html  A Biographical Sketch of W.E.B. Du Bois].  W.E.B. Du Bois Learning Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Booker T. Washington===

[[Booker T. Washington]] was considered one of the most influential black educators of the 19th and 20th centuries. Born in 1856 as a slave in Virginia, Washington came of age as slavery was coming to an end.  Just as slavery ended, however, it was replaced by a system of sharecropping in the South that resulted in black indebtedness.  With growing discrimination in the South following the end of the Reconstruction era, Washington felt that the key to advancing in America rested with getting an education and improving one's economic well-being, not with political advancement.  Consequently, in 1881, he founded the [[Tuskegee Institute]], now Tuskegee University, in order to provide individuals with an education that would help them to find employment in the growing industrial sector. By focusing on education for blacks, rather than political advancement, he gained financial support from whites for his cause.  Secretly, however, he pursued legal challenges against segregation and disfranchisement of blacks.&lt;ref name="Harlen"&gt;Harlen, Louis. 1972. [http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/washington/bio.html   Booker T. Washington]. University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern Theorists ==

=== Patricia Hill Collins ===
[[Patricia Hill Collins]] is currently a Distinguished University Professor Emerita at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. She received her PhD in sociology in 1984 from [[Brandeis University]]. Collins was the president-elect for the [[American Sociological Association]], where she was the 100th president and the first African-American woman to be president of the organization. Collins is a social theorist whose work and research primarily focuses on race, social class, sexuality, and gender. She has written a number of books and articles on said topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socy.umd.edu/facultyprofile/Collins/Patricia%20Hill|title=Patricia Hill Collins {{!}} SOCY l Sociology Department l University of Maryland|website=socy.umd.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins work focuses on [[Intersectionality]], by looking at issues through the lens of women of color. In her work, she writes "First, we need new visions of what oppression is, new categories of analysis that are inclusive of race, class, and gender as distinctive yet interlocking structures of oppression".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Patricia Hill|date=1993|title=Toward a New Vision: Race, Class, and Gender as Categories of Analysis and Connection|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/41680038|journal=Race, Sex &amp; Class|volume=1|issue=1|pages=25–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eduardo Bonilla-Silva ===
[[Eduardo Bonilla-Silva]] is currently a professor of sociology at [[Duke University]] and is the 2018 president of the American Sociological Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asanet.org/about-asa/leadership|title=Leadership|date=2009-05-23|work=American Sociological Association|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received his PhD in 1993 from [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], which is where he met his mentor, Professor [[Charles Camic]], of which he said "Camic believed in me and told me, just before graduation, that I should stay in the states as I would contribute greatly to American sociology." Bonilla-Silva did not start off his work as a "race scholar," but originally was trained in [[class analysis]], [[political sociology]], and sociology of development ([[globalization]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sociology.duke.edu/people/eduardo-bonilla-silva|title=Eduardo Bonilla-Silva {{!}} Duke Sociology|website=sociology.duke.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 1980s when he joined a student movement calling for racial justice at the University of Wisconsin that he began his work in race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asanet.org/news-events/footnotes/sep-oct-2017/features/introducing-eduardo-bonilla-silva-2018-asa-president|title=Introducing Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, 2018 ASA President|date=2017-10-29|work=American Sociological Association|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, [[Racism without Racists]], Bonilla-Silva discusses less overt racism, which he refers to as "new racism," which disguises itself "under the cloak of legality" in order to accomplish the same things. He also discusses "color-blind racism," which is essentially when people go off the basis that we have achieved equality and deny past and present discriminations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/973481548|title=Racism without racists : color-blind racism and the persistence of racial inequality in America|last=1962-|first=Bonilla-Silva, Eduardo,|isbn=9781442276222|edition= Fifth|location=Lanham|oclc=973481548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social psychology==

One of the most important social psychological findings concerning race relations is that members of stereotyped groups internalize those stereotypes and thus suffer a wide range of harmful consequences.  For example, in a phenomenon called [[stereotype threat]], members of racial and ethnic groups that are stereotyped as scoring poorly on tests will perform poorer on those tests if they are reminded of this stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;"What is stereotype threat?" http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The effect is so strong that even simply asking the test-taker to state her or his race before taking the test (such is by bubbling in "African American" on a multiple choice question) will significantly alter test performance.&lt;ref&gt;Steele &amp; Aronson. 1995. Stereotype threat and the intellectual test performance of African Americans. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;  A specifically sociological contribution to this line of research has found that such negative stereotypes can be created on the spot: an experiment by Michael Lovaglia et al.(1998) demonstrated that [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] people can be made to suffer stereotype threat if they are led to believe that they are a disadvantaged group for a particular kind of test.&lt;ref name="Lovaglia"&gt;Lovaglia, Michael, JW Lucas, SR Thye. 1998. Status Processes and Mental Ability Test Scores. American Journal of Sociology.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racism and psychoanalysis==

[[Psychoanalysis]] has much to offer the study of racism.&lt;ref name="minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wear|first1=Andrew|title=Pauline, politics and psychoanalysis: theorising racism in Australia|url=https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/39156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its central proposition is that rationality is not the natural state of the individual, and that individuals develop defence mechanisms to cope with anxiety. Humans resist change because change threatens established ways of dealing with anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frosch|first1=Stephen|title=Psychoanalysis and Psychology: Minding the Gap}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual defence mechanisms contribute to [[social defence]] mechanisms. The most regressive defence mechanism (the 'paranoid-schizoid' position) results in a complete dehumanising of the 'all-bad' group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Segal|first1=Hanna|title=Introduction to the Work of Melanie Klein}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'all-bad' group is admired as well as feared (often evident in the [[conspiracy theory]]). Paradoxically, the arbitrariness of the category 'race' enables the psychotic subject to invest more meaning in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rustin|first1=Michael|title=The Good Society and the Inner World: Psychoanalysis and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernity's attempt at rationalisation papers over a polycentric psyche (i.e. all of us still have anxieties and desires, despite our apparent rationality). Racism is a response to the abstracting logic of modernity. The rationality of western, 'white' society is defined in opposition to the 'animality' of black, 'primitive' society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kovel, Joel|editor1-last=Elliot|editor1-first=Anthony|editor2-last=Frosch|editor2-first=Stephen|title=Psychoanalysis in Contexts: Paths between Theory and Modern Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some psychoanalytic theorists also argue that passionate anti-racism can produce psychological states analogous to racism.&lt;ref name="minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au"/&gt;

==Audit studies==
{{Main|audit study}}
Another important line of research on race takes the form of [[audit studies]].  The audit study approach creates an artificial pool of people among whom there are no average differences by race. For instance, groups of white and black auditors are matched on every category other than their race, and thoroughly trained to act in identical ways.  Given nearly identical resumes, they are sent to interview for the same jobs.  Simple comparisons of means can yield strong evidence regarding discrimination. The best known audit study in sociology is ''The Mark of a Criminal Record'' by [[Harvard University]] sociologist Devah Pager.  This study compares job prospects of black and white men who were recently released from jail.  Its key finding is that blacks are significantly discriminated against when applying for service jobs.  Moreover, whites ''with'' a criminal record have about the same prospect of getting an interview as blacks ''without'' one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pager|first1=D.|title=The Mark of a Criminal Record|journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]]|date=March 2003|volume=108|issue=5|pages=937–975|doi=10.1086/374403}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another recent audit by [[UCLA]] sociologist S. Michael Gaddis examines the job prospects of black and white college graduates from elite private and high quality state higher education institutions.  This research finds that blacks who graduate from an elite school such as Harvard have about the same prospect of getting an interview as whites who graduate from a state school such as UMass Amherst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaddis|first1=S. M.|title=Discrimination in the Credential Society: An Audit Study of Race and College Selectivity in the Labor Market|journal=[[Social Forces]]|date=June 2015|volume=93|issue=4|pages=1451–1479|doi=10.1093/sf/sou111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discipline development by country==

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the study of racial and ethnic relations has been widely influenced by the factors associated with each major wave of [[immigration]] as the incoming group struggles with keeping its own cultural and ethnic identity while also assimilating into the broader mainstream [[American culture]] and [[Economy of the United States|economy]].  One of the first and most prevalent topics within American study is that of the relations between white Americans and [[African Americans]] due to the heavy [[collective memory]] and culture borne out of and lingering from centuries of forced [[slavery]] in [[plantations in the American South|plantations]].   Throughout the rest of American history, each new wave of [[immigration to the United States]] has brought another set of issues as the tension between maintaining [[cultural diversity|diversity]] and [[cultural assimilation|assimilating]] takes on new shapes.  [[Racism]] and conflict often rears up during these times.&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;Park, Robert Ezra. 1950. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8jcVlv2HTj8C&amp;pg=PR5 The Early Sociology of Race and Ethnicity]. The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some key currents can be gleaned from this body of knowledge: in the context of the United States, there is a tendency for minorities to be punished in times of economic, political and/or geopolitical crises. Times of social and systemic stability, however, tend to mute whatever underlying tensions exist between different groups. In times of societal crisis—whether perceived or real—patterns or retractability of American identities have erupted to the fore of America's political landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fong|first1=Jack|title=American Social ‘Reminders’ of Citizenship after September 11, 2001: Nativisms in the Ethnocratic Retractability of American Identity|journal=Qualitative Sociology Review|volume=4|issue=1|pages=69–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable and infamous examples can be seen in [[Executive Order 9066]] that [[Internment of Japanese Americans|placed Japanese Americans in incarceration centers]] as well as the 19th century [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] that banned Chinese laborers from emigrating to the United States (local workers viewed Chinese laborers as a threat). Current examples include post-[[9/11]] backlash against Muslim Americans, although these have taken place in civil society, not through public policy.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], foreign nationals were actively encouraged and sponsored to migrate in the 1950s after the dissolution of [[British Empire|the Empire]] and the social devastation of the [[Second World War]]. The [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962|1962 Commonwealth Immigrants Act]] changed the law so that only certain [[British Commonwealth]] members were able to migrate. This law was tightened again with the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968]] and [[Immigration Act 1971]]. The [[Race Relations Act 1968]] extended certain anti-discrimination policies with respect to employment, housing, commercial and other services. This was extended again with the [[Race Relations Act 1976]].

As with the UK establishments of [[media studies|media]] and [[cultural studies]], 'ethnic relations' is often taught as a loosely distinct discipline either within sociology departments or other schools of humanities.

Major British theorists include [[Paul Gilroy]], [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], Richard Jenkins, [[John Rex]], [[Michael Banton]] and [[Tariq Modood]].

'''''The Invention of Art: A Cultural History''''' (2001) is an [[art history]] book  by Dr. Larry Shiner (1934- ), Emeritus Professor of Philosophy, History, and Visual Arts at the [[University of Illinois, Springfield]]  &lt;ref name="PW"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Invention of Art: A Cultural History: review|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-226-75342-3|journal=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChicagoUP"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Invention of Art: A Cultural History|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo3633486.html|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shiner spent over a decade to finish the work of this book.&lt;ref name="uis.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uis.edu/philosophy/faculty/research/shiner.html |title=Dr. Larry Shiner - Research - Philosophy |publisher=uis.edu |accessdate=2013-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

The book sees [[fine art]] as a modern invention due to [[social transformation]]s during the 18th century.&lt;ref name="ChicagoUP" /&gt;

David Clowney, writing for ''Contemporary Aesthetics'' summarizes the central thesis of this book.

"In The Invention of Art: A Cultural History , Larry Shiner claims that [[Art]] with a capital A, [[Fine Art]], was invented in the west in the eighteenth century. The claim is not original with him; he credits [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]]’s essay “The Modern System of the Arts” as the inspiration for his work. Others have made this claim as well, among them [[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Paul Mattick]], and [[Terry Eagleton]]. What Shiner has added is a detailed proof of the Kristeller claim using the methods of intellectual, social, cultural, and art history.

In brief, the thesis is this: There was a traditional “system of the arts” in the West before the eighteenth century. (Other traditional cultures still have a similar system.) In that system, an artist or artisan was a skilled maker or practitioner, a work of art was the useful product of skilled work, and the appreciation of the arts was integrally connected with their role in the rest of life. “Art,” in other words, meant approximately the same thing as the Greek word techne, or in English “[[skill]]”, a sense that has survived in phrases like “the art of war,” “the art of love,” and “the art of medicine.”"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=519|title=A Third System of the Arts? An Exploration of Some Ideas from Larry Shiner's ''The Invention of Art: A Cultural History''|journal=Contemporary Aesthetics|author=David Clowney|accessdate=23 January 2017|date=December 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is divided into five parts
* ''I.   Before Fine Art and Craft'' - Details the lack of any differentiation between skilled work of any type during three periods of history; classical antiquity, the middle ages, and [[the Renaissance]]. The lack of any social role separating artists from artisans, nor any concept of the aesthetic is also discussed. In the final chapter of Part I, the beginnings of some differentiation during the 17th century is described.
* ''II.  Art Divided''
* ''III. Countercurrents'' 
* ''IV.  The Apotheosis of Art'' 
* ''V.   Beyond Art and Craft''.&lt;ref name="ChicagoUP" /&gt;

==Quotes==
“The modern system of art is not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old.” (Shiner 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;3)

== Reviews ==
In a book review published in ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', Mitch Avila   wrote:&lt;ref name="Avila"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Avila|first1=Mitch|title=Reviews: The Invention of Art: A Cultural History by Larry Shiner|journal= The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|volume= 61|issue=4|pages=401–403|date=Autumn 2003|jstor= 1559075}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Shiner aptly characterizes his narrative as one that aims to heal the unnecessarily fractured conceptions of art and art practice that mark the contemporary artworld... By showing that the essentialist conception of art, along with its normative and regulative implications, is the artifact of a particular historical and cultural world, Shiner invites us to freely respond to the manifold richness of human expression and embellishment.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reviewer Marc Spiegler called the book "a must-read for anyone active in the arts".&lt;ref name=Spiegler&gt;

'''WorldFish''' is an international, nonprofit research organization with [[headquarters]] in [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]], and offices in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and the Pacific. WorldFish’s mission is to harness the potential of fisheries and aquaculture to reduce [[poverty]] and [[hunger]] in developing countries.&lt;ref name="thetechawards"&gt;[http://thetechawards.thetech.org/the-laureates/worldfish-center WorldFish Center mission], The Tech Awards article.&lt;/ref&gt;

WorldFish is a member of the [[CGIAR|Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers (CGIAR)]], a global agriculture research partnership for a food secure future.&lt;ref name="IDS"&gt;[https://www.ids.ac.uk/organisation/worldfish-center WorldFish Center as part of CGIAR], Institute of Development Studies, WorldFish Center article.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Working in partnership with private and public sectors and civil society, WorldFish uses its scientific expertise in fisheries and [[aquaculture]] to promote sustainable, evidence-based development solutions and policy recommendations that support the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref name="UNMDGs"&gt;[http://www.worldfishcenter.org/sites/default/files/WF_903_0.pdf How WorldFish supports U.N. Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)], worldfishcenter.org online pamphlet.&lt;/ref&gt; All services and solutions developed by the Center are international public goods that are made freely available to all.&lt;ref name="publicGoods"&gt;[http://www.cgiar.org/www-archive/www.cgiar.org/pdf/ir_sagasti_timmer.pdf CGIAR as a Provider of International Public Goods], cgiar.org pdf document&lt;/ref&gt;
 
WorldFish has introduced innovative technologies and practices that are brought to scale through a network of partners. The Center works on a breeding program to develop the Abbassa strain of Nile Tilapia that helped increase aquaculture productivity and improve food security for millions of Egyptians.&lt;ref name="abbassaStrain"&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/global/r-d/news/fast-growing-fish-variety-could-benefit-egypt-and-west-africa-.html Abbassa strain of Nile Tilapia], SciDevNet article.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bangladesh]], WorldFish trained and supported thousands of rural farmers by helping them improve the productivity of their homestead ponds and gardens.

WorldFish has been recognized with a [[The Tech Awards|Tech Museum Award]]&lt;ref name="techMuseumAward"&gt;[http://news.bio-medicine.org/biology-news-3/Worldfish-Center-honored-as-2005-Tech-Museum-Awards-Laureate-10004-1/ Tech Museum Award], Bio-Medicine, Biology Research Tools article.&lt;/ref&gt; and several [[World Bank Development Marketplace Award]]s.&lt;ref name="multipleAwards"&gt;[http://www.cgiar.org/web-archives/www-cgiar-org-monthlystory-june2005-html/ World Bank Global Development Marketplace awards], cgiar.org article.&lt;/ref&gt;
==WorldFish Research==
WorldFish is committed to meeting two key development challenges: 1) Improving the livelihoods of those who are poor and vulnerable in places where fisheries and aquaculture can make a difference and 2) achieving large scale, environmentally sustainable, increases in supply and access to fish at affordable prices for poor consumers in developing countries.&lt;ref name="welcomeWF"&gt;[http://www.worldfishcenter.org/welcome-worldfish#.U647GF4SgpE Welcome to WorldFish], Article, worldfishcenter.org&lt;/ref&gt;

To meet these challenges WorldFish focuses its expertise and research in the following areas: 
* Building adaptive capacity to climate change in fisheries and aquaculture
* Strengthening gender equality in fish-dependent communities 
* Increasing the benefits to poor people from fisheries and aquaculture value-chains
* Improving nutrition and health through fisheries and aquaculture
* Identifying and promoting policies and practices to increase the resilience of small-scale fisheries
* Sustainably increasing the productivity of small-scale aquaculture

WorldFish is one of the 15 specialized research centers of the Consortium on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR),&lt;ref name="SEAT"&gt;[http://seatglobal.eu/partners/international/the-worldfish-center/ SEAT Article], seatglobal.eu&lt;/ref&gt; and is also an implementing partner for the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS).&lt;ref name="AAS Zambia"&gt;[http://www.thefishsite.com/fishnews/21455/sustainably-managing-natural-resources-in-zambia AAS Zambia], thefishsite.com, Article&lt;/ref&gt; This research program aims to reduce poverty and improve food security for people whose livelihoods depend on aquatic agricultural systems.&lt;ref name="AAS food security"&gt;[http://aas.cgiar.org/program/about-program#.U64_rI2Syf9 AAS food security], aas.cgiar.org, Article&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact and Innovation==
WorldFish, with its partners, has raised incomes for millions of poor people by integrating aquaculture with agriculture and has empowered poor communities to participate in the sustainable co-management of their fisheries. At its core, WorldFish is a scientific research organization. The center works with an extensive network of donors and partners to create positive change for the millions who depend on fish in the developing world. It has helped countries cope with disaster and conflict by restoring fisheries, providing nations with tools to improve the planning and management of major river basins and strengthening national capacities for fisheries management.

Three areas of work have generated particularly large impact:

* The breeding of much higher-yielding Tilapia fish varieties, widely used in aquaculture across Asia, greatly raised productivity and incomes of poor small-scale farmers: $170 returned for each $100 invested per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/50094/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053510/http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/50094/ |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}, Research For Development&lt;/ref&gt;
* The strengthening Aquatic Resource Governance  (STARGO) project helped lake communities in Zambia, Cambodia and Uganda build lake capacity to manage conflicts over fish resources and lay a foundation for sustainable management of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coresilience.org/], Coresilience.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Egypt, WorldFish used selective breeding approaches to develop the 'Abbassa Strain', which grows up to 28% faster than the most commonly used commercial breed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/global/r-d/news/fast-growing-fish-variety-could-benefit-egypt-and-west-africa-.html?stay=full], Sci Dev Net&lt;/ref&gt;  The Improving Employment and Income through the Development of Egypt's Aquaculture Sector (IEIDEAS) project supplied 50 fish farms and 130 hatcheries with the fast-growing strain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infofish.org/pdf/GSH/GH1_2014.pdf], Globe Fish Highlights&lt;/ref&gt; IEIDEAS is strengthening the Egyptian aquaculture industry by providing training and by generating employment for people who depend on the sector.

==Milestones==

The following information provides major milestones in the development and operation of the WorldFish Center, from the conceptual phase to the present, highlighting organizational changes and developments, such as the formal establishment of the Center, the establishment and closure of sites outside the headquarters, Board Chair and Directors General, and milestones which led to the entrance of the Center into the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. Some of this material is taken from '[https://www.worldfishcenter.org/content/lasting-catch A Lasting Catch]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldfishcenter.org/content/lasting-catch|title=A Lasting Catch|last=Schioler|first=E.|date=2002|website=WorldFish|publisher=WorldFish Center|page=147 pp|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.'

''1973-1974 Conceptual phase'':

* The Rockefeller Foundation convenes a conference in October 1973, to review worldwide and regional needs in aquaculture and fisheries.
* '[http://pubs.iclarm.net/resource_centre/WF-44.pdf A Proposal for the Creation of an International Center for Living Aquatic Resources Management (ICLARM])' is published in 1974. This working document was prepared by Dr John Pino, Rockefeller Foundation.

''1975-1976 Exploratory phase:''

* Rockefeller Foundation Program, hosted by the University of Hawaii, commences in early 1975.
* Dr Philip Helfrich (USA) of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology, University of Hawaii, accepts the post of Center Director ( January 1975-November 1976).
* Staff and consultants fly 650,000 km, visiting 500 individuals and 43 national agencies in 47 countries, developing long-range programs and selecting a suitable headquarters location.
* Research programs are set up with the following thrusts: Aquaculture, Traditional Fisheries, Resource Development and Management, Marine Affairs, and Education and Training.
* The Center produces its first publication in 1975.

''1977 Establishment phase:''

* On 20 January 1977 'ICLARM' becomes an independent institution. Two months later the headquarters moved to Manila in the Philippines.
* The first Director General, Dr John C. Marr (USA), is appointed (November 1976-March 1979).
