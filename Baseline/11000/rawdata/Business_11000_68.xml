      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2725">'''Activity-based management''' ('''ABM''') is a method of identifying and evaluating activities that a business performs, using [[activity-based costing]] to carry out a [[value chain]] analysis or a re-engineering initiative to improve strategic and operational decisions in an organization.

==Activity-based costing==

[[Activity-based costing]] establishes relationships between [[Business process overhead|overhead costs]] and activities so that costs can be more precisely allocated to products, services, or customer segments. 

Activity-based management focuses on managing activities to reduce costs and improve customer value.
Kaplan and Cooper &lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, R. S., &amp; Cooper, R. (1998). Cost and effect: Using integrated cost systems to drive profitability and performance. Boston: Harvard Business School Press&lt;/ref&gt; divide ABM into operational and strategic:

* Operational ABM is about ''doing things right'', using ABC information to improve efficiency. Those activities which add value to the product can be identified and improved. Activities that don't add value need to be reduced to cut costs without reducing product value.
* Strategic ABM is about ''doing the right things'', using ABC information to decide which products to develop and which activities to use. This can also be used for customer profitability analysis, identifying which customers are the most profitable and focusing on them more.

==Risks==

A risk with ABM is that some activities have an implicit value, not necessarily reflected in a financial value added to any product. For instance, a particularly pleasant workplace can help attract and retain the best staff, but may not be identified as adding value in operational ABM. A customer who represents a loss based on committed activities, but who opens up leads in a new market, may be identified as a low value customer by a strategic ABM process.

Managers should interpret these values and use ABM as a "common, yet neutral, ground … this provides the basis for negotiation".&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, T., &amp; Bull, R. (2000). The great debate. Management Accounting, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; ABM can give middle managers an understanding of costs to other teams to help them make decisions that benefit the whole organization, not just their activities' bottom line.

'''Air traffic management''' is an aviation term encompassing all systems that assist aircraft to depart from an aerodrome, transit airspace, and land at a destination aerodrome, including [[Air Traffic Services]] (ATS), [[Airspace Management]] (ASM), and [[Air Traffic Flow and Capacity Management]] (ATFCM).

The increasing emphasis of modern ATM is on interoperable and harmonised systems that allow an aircraft to operate with the minimum of performance change from one airspace to another. ATC systems have traditionally been developed by individual States that concentrated on their own requirements, creating different levels of service and capability around the world. Many [[Air Navigation Service Provider]]s (ANSPs) do not provide an ATC service that matches the capabilities of modern aircraft, so [[ICAO]] has developed the Aviation System Block Upgrade (ASBU) initiative in order to harmonise global planning of technology upgrades. 

In the Asia/Pacific Region, the ICAO Regional Office in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] is developing a Seamless ATM Plan, which is intended to set expectations for ATM upgrades in the world's busiest aviation region in terms of Revenue Passenger Kilometres. The Seamless ATM Plan is expected to be approved by the Asia/Pacific Air Navigation Planning and Implementation Regional Group (APANPIRG) in mid-2013.

'''Arthur Maitland Hughes''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|OBE|JP}} (11 October 1924 – 20 June 2005) was a New Zealand [[rugby union]] player. A [[Rugby union positions#Hooker|hooker]], Hughes represented [[Auckland Rugby Football Union|Auckland]] at a provincial level, and was a member of the New Zealand national side, the [[All Blacks]] from 1947 to 1950. Unusually, he was selected for the All Blacks before making his provincial debut. He played seven matches for the All Blacks including six internationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://stats.allblacks.com/asp/Profile.asp?ABID=407 |title = Arthur Hughes | last = Luxford | first = Bob | publisher = New Zealand Rugby Museum | accessdate = 14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes retired from rugby in 1950 to concentrate on business interests and rose to become managing director of the family liquor firm, Hughes and Cossar. He also served as president of the [[Auckland Racing Club]] and the New Zealand Racing Conference.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10332541  | title=Obituary: Arthur Hughes | date=25 June 2005 | work= New Zealand Herald | accessdate=14 July 2013 | first=D.J. | last=Cameron }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===
Prior to launching the [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]], executive director Lonergan opened a retail store in 2008, Artistri Atelier Boutique. The idea was to support women craftspeople both in [[Canada]] and in the developing world by promoting and selling their work in the store.&lt;ref name="Chatelaine"&gt;Friedman, Caroline (September 24, 2010).

''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njNJDV8lAZI]'' YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt; The retail store is now closed.

=== Today ===
Today the nonprofit’s main activity is the implementation of its [[entrepreneurship]] training programs in the developing world, to empower women artisans to run their own micro-enterprises and earn a sustainable income to support themselves and their families.&lt;ref name="Gazette" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;CBC News: Montreal - March 09, 2016.

The '''Progressive Insurance Automotive X PRIZE''' ('''PIAXP''' or '''AXP''') was a set of competitions, programs and events, from the [[X Prize Foundation]], to "inspire a new generation of super-efficient vehicles that help break America's addiction to oil and stem the effects of climate change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines, Version 1.2, 13 January 2009|page=5|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801164332/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|archivedate=1 August 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Progressive Corporation|Progressive Insurance]] was the title sponsor of the prize, the centerpiece of which is the Competition Division, within which a 10-million-dollar purse was divided between the winners of three competitions.

The essence of each competition was to design, build and race super-efficient vehicles that achieved 100 [[Miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent|MPGe]] (2.35&amp;nbsp;liter/100&amp;nbsp;kilometer) efficiency, produced less than 200&amp;nbsp;grams/mile well-to-wheel CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent [[Exhaust gas|emissions]], and could be manufactured for the mass market.&lt;ref name='msnbc'/&gt;  Within the Competition Division, there are two vehicle classes: Mainstream and Alternative. The mainstream class had a prize of $5 million. The alternate class had two separate prizes of $2.5 million, one for side-by-side seating and one for tandem seating.&lt;ref name="guidelines"&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=progressiveautoxprize.org|accessdate=2009-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PIAXP has an Educational Program, funded by a $3.5 million grant from the [[United States Department of Energy]], to engage students and the public in learning about advanced vehicle technologies, energy efficiency, climate change, alternative fuels, and the science, technology, engineering, and math behind efficient vehicle development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Program  Overview |url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/education|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-30| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090614171836/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/education| archivedate= 14 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The X Prize Foundation began work on the development of a competition to spur innovation in the automotive industry in 2005 and on 6 March 2006 announced that Mark Goodstein would join the Foundation as an Executive Director of the new prize.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: X Prize Foundation Hires Mark Goodstein as Executive Director|url= http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/press-release/x-prize-foundation-hires-mark-goodstein-as-executive-director |publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A little more than year later, on 12 April 2007, the Foundation formally announced the creation of the prize at the 2007 New York Auto Show and set the purse at $10 million for a car that could get {{convert|100|mpgus|L/100&amp;nbsp;km mpgimp|abbr=on}} and be sold for a reasonable price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auto X Prize to reward 100-mpg car|url=http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2007/04/auto_x_prize_to.html|author=Eric Evarts|publisher=[[Consumer Reports]]|accessdate=2009-06-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305093834/http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2007/04/auto_x_prize_to.html|archivedate=5 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the subsequent year, the X Prize Foundation solidified sponsorship for the prize and on 20 March 2008 announced that Progressive Insurance would be the Title Sponsor of the Prize and fund the $10 million purse.  From that point onward, it was known as the Progressive Insurance Automotive X Prize (PIAXP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: X Prize Foundation Progressive Insurance Join Forces to Officially Announce the $10 Million Automotive X Prize|url= http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/press-release/x-prize-foundation-hires-mark-goodstein-as-executive-director |publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 12 April 2007 announcement of the creation of the X Prize, the Foundation released draft Competition Guidelines, which were open for public comment from 2 April to 31 May 2007.  The latest guidelines were published on 10 January 2009. The competition guidelines are the product of hundreds of volunteers of the AXP and world-class advisors.&lt;ref name="guidelines"/&gt;

On 7 April 2009, the [[X Prize Foundation]] announced that 111 teams had registered by the February 2009 deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/news-events/press-release/111-teams-get-green-light-to-advance-in-multimillion-dollar-competition|title=111 Teams Get Green Light to Advance in Multimillion Dollar Competition|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 20 October 2009, the design judging had winnowed the number of teams down to 43, with some publicly, and others quietly, withdrawing.&lt;ref name="progressiveautoxprize.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/teams |title=Teams &amp;#124; Progressive Automotive XPRIZE |publisher=Progressiveautoxprize.org |accessdate=2011-01-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101228170845/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/teams| archivedate= 28 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The formal vehicle competition events began on 26 April 2010, and consisted of the remaining four stages: Shakedown (26 April – 7 May 2010), Knockout ( 16–30 June 2010), Finals ( 19–30 July 2010) and Validation (August 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=COMPETITION TIMELINE|url= http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/prize-details/competition-timeline |publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2011-01-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101228192728/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/prize-details/competition-timeline| archivedate= 28 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winners of the competition were announced on 16 September 2010.&lt;ref name="XPrizeAwards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Teams Awarded Share of $10 Million Purse in Progressive Insurance Automotive X PRIZE for Super Fuel-Efficient Vehicles|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/news-events/press-releases/three-teams-awarded-share-10-million-purse-progressive-insurance-automotive-x-prize-super-fu|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=17 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100919163613/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/news-events/press-releases/three-teams-awarded-share-10-million-purse-progressive-insurance-automotive-x-prize-super-fu| archivedate= 19 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Team Edison2 won the $5 million Mainstream competition with its four-passenger [[Very Light Car]], obtaining 102.5&amp;nbsp;MPGe or just below 69&amp;nbsp;MPG running on [[E85]] fuel.
* Team [[Li-Ion Motors]] won the $2.5 million Alternative Side-by-Side competition with their aerodynamic Wave-II electric vehicle achieving 187&amp;nbsp;MPGe.
* Team [[X-Tracer Switzerland]] won the $2.5 million Alternative Tandem competition with their 205.3&amp;nbsp;MPGe faired electric motorcycle.

==Vehicle requirements==
Within the Competition Division, there are two vehicle classes—Mainstream and Alternative—both of which have the same requirements for [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] and [[Exhaust gas|emissions]], but differing design constraints. The Alternative class is further divided into tandem and side-by-side classes.  Vehicles in the Mainstream Class must meet specifications that are derived from typical small, five-passenger, economy mixed-use vehicles.  The Alternative Class has fewer performance and design restrictions and provides an outlet for innovation.  Both classes allow entries that are modifications of an existing popular vehicle, provided that all PIAXP requirements are met.

Vehicles in both classes must have a fuel economy of 100 [[Miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent|MPGe]] (21&amp;nbsp;kWh or 2.35&amp;nbsp;liters of petrol/100&amp;nbsp;kilometer) and produce less than 200&amp;nbsp;grams/mile CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions (measured well-to-wheel).  For electric vehicles, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions requirement is a more binding constraint.  Because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions will be calculated assuming a national average of electricity sources projected to 2014, an all-electric car will have to achieve 114 MPGe in order to produce less than 200&amp;nbsp;grams/mile CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.  Further, electricity consumption is measured at the "plug" side of the battery charging device, so it would have to achieve 114 MPGe, assuming 100% efficient battery charging.  If the charger were 85% efficient, this requirement would grow to 134 MPGe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines, Version 1.2, 13 January 2009|pages=27, 29|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090801164332/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf| archivedate= 1 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy and Emissions Spreadsheet 12.1.08| url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/Energy_and_Emissions_spreadsheet_12.1.08.xls|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the other words, efficiency of electric cars should be not 21 but 16 kWh/100&amp;nbsp;km.

Vehicles in both classes also must have features expected of a modern automobile including an enclosed cabin with windshield and windows, operating windshield wipers, washers, headlights, horn, indicators, brake lights, reflective devices, rear and side-view mirrors, and seat belts.  They must have the usual automotive controls, including accelerator pedal, brake pedal, steering mechanism (not necessarily a wheel) and indicators.  They must be "highway capable", which is defined as the ability to maintain {{convert|65|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} on a four percent uphill grade and to accelerate from {{convert|40|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in less than 9&amp;nbsp;seconds.  They must be able to brake from 60 to 0&amp;nbsp;mph in less than {{convert|170|ft|m}}, meet existing noise standards and use tires that meet automotive or motorcycle (alternative class only and only if the vehicle is otherwise eligible to be classified as a motorcycle) standards.  Both must meet the same set of static and dynamic stability requirements.

The mainstream vehicle must seat at least four adults with at least two side-by-side front seats, have at least {{convert|10|cuft|m3}} of useful cargo space in one contiguous location not counting the passenger seats, accelerate from 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 15&amp;nbsp;seconds or less, and be able to drive {{convert|200|mi|km}} without refueling or recharging.  The mainstream vehicle must have four or more wheels.

The alternate class vehicle must seat at least two people, accelerate from 0 to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 18&amp;nbsp;seconds or less, and be able to drive {{convert|100|mi|km}} without refueling or recharging.  The alternative vehicle has no minimum number of wheels, but it must remain upright when stopped with no driver inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines, Version 1.2, 13 January 2009|pages=16, 20|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090801164332/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf| archivedate= 1 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the main focus of PIAXP is fuel economy and carbon emissions, not safety, the vehicles must be "production capable".  Therefore, the entries must either be fully compliant with the [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108|Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards]] (FMVSS) and other applicable [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) requirements or compliance has to be "designed in".  For example, allowance for airbags in the designs is considered acceptable without actually installing the airbags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines, Version 1.2, 13 January 2009|pages=20, 21|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090801164332/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf| archivedate= 1 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teams are also required to submit a [[business plan]] which clearly demonstrates an ability to produce 10,000 vehicles per year.  Note that teams are not required to be under-taking this plan, but the plan has to exist and the car has to be designed such that this plan is feasible.

With the lack of mainstream entrants from established automobile companies, a Demonstration Division was created so that automakers could at least display and promote their highest efficiency vehicles alongside the main competition.  However, there were too few entrants by 1 March registration deadline, and this division was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/prize-details/registration|title=X Prize Team Registration page|date=1 March 2010|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only confirmed entrant was the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)|Tesla Roadster]], which had dropped out of the main competition.

Vehicles in the Demonstration Division would have met the same requirements as Mainstream Class vehicles in the Competition Division, except for MPGe and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.  There was no Alternative Class equivalent in the Demonstration Division.  These vehicles would have been stock vehicles, i.e., vehicles identical to those for sale or pre-production prototypes of vehicles intended for sales.

Vehicles in the Demonstration Division would have been tested in the same way as Competition Division vehicles and would have participated in the PIAXP competition events under the same rules in order to demonstrate and showcase their capabilities and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines, Version 1.2, 13 January 2009|pages=39, 40|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090801164332/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf| archivedate= 1 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition events==
The competition timeline was finalized as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/prize-details/competition-timeline|title=Competition Timeline|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=6 May 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100504221127/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/prize-details/competition-timeline| archivedate= 4 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design judging===
Accepted teams must provide evidence that their vehicles are production capable, by providing a detailed Data Submissions covering four areas:

* Safety and Emissions:  Vehicles must be designed so that, in production, they meet U.S. safety standards (FMVSS) and U.S. emission standards.
* Manufacturability and Cost:  Vehicles must be capable of being manufactured in quantities of 10,000 per year with production costs within levels consistent with that production volume.
* Features:  Vehicles must have the features expected by consumers for vehicles within the projected prices range.
* Business Plan:  There must be a credible plan to manufacture, sell and support 10,000 vehicles (or conversions) per year by 2014.  The plan must address required fuel infrastructure if it does not already exist.

Those that pass this hurdle will be invited to bring their vehicles to the competition events.  The design judging was closed in October 2009, with 43 teams remaining.

===Shakedown stages===
The first three stages will be a “shake-down” period and performance in these stages will not count to final scores.  The first step of the competition will be the review of technical reports, technical inspection of the vehicles and performance testing of safety elements to eliminate unsafe vehicles.  The two-week shakedown took place at the [[Michigan International Speedway]], from 26 April to 7 May 2010.

Those that pass the initial technical and safety inspections and tests will participate in the remaining competition events. These include stage races, additional active safety performance tests and a dynamometer test.

===Knockout stage===
The next stage will be a “knockout” qualifying event.  To advance, vehicles must pass active safety performance tests, meet acceptable emission levels and demonstrate at least 67 MPGe on a test track.  These were held at the [[Michigan International Speedway]] from  20–29 June 2010.  After this stage, only 15 vehicles from 12 teams remained in the competition.

===Finals stage===
The final stages will determine the winning teams.  To complete the race successfully, vehicles must maintain a minimum average speed (maximum allowable time) while meeting PIAXP requirements for fuel economy (90 MPGe) and emissions.  The finals also include a tie breaking race; the vehicle with the best overall time while still meeting requirements will take the purse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition Guidelines, Version 1.2, 13 January 2009|pages=10–12|url=http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf|publisher=[[X Prize Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-06-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090801164332/http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.0_20090110.pdf| archivedate= 1 August 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The final stages are scheduled for  19–30 July 2010 at the [[Michigan International Speedway]].

===Validation stage===
The few remaining teams were validated on [[dynamometer]]s under laboratory conditions at the EPA Labs in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] and [[Argonne National Laboratory]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. This stage is scheduled for August 2010. The validation results count toward 50% of the final efficiency figures, which together must exceed 100 MPGe.

Edison2 was an exception. The engines in both Very Light Cars failed before validation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://autoblog.xprize.org/axp/2010/08/the-competition-isnt-over-yet-why-validation-matters.html#comments| title = The Competition Isn’t Over Yet: Why Validation Matters| accessdate = 2011-03-31| author = Eric Cahill| publisher = Progressive Automotive XPrize Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edison2 was allowed to circumvent the rules governing procedures and provided independent third-party validation reports instead of undergoing the same validation testing as other finalist teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2010/08/auto-x-prizes-mainstream-finalist-gets-ok-to-provide-own-validation-results.html |title=Auto X-Prize's 'Mainstream' Finalist Gets OK to Provide Own Validation Results |accessdate=2011-03-31 |author=John O'Dell |publisher=Edmunds.com Green Car Advisor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820062230/http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2010/08/auto-x-prizes-mainstream-finalist-gets-ok-to-provide-own-validation-results.html |archivedate=20 August 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational program==
The [[United States Department of Energy]] joined the PIAXP as a sponsor, funding an educational program targeted to young people.  The first component of the Education Program is a web site created in partnership with Discovery Education, www.FuelOurFutureNow.com, featuring activities for K-12 students, as well as videos, virtual labs, and interactive resources intended for use in school and in the home.

==Competing teams==
Although 111 teams registered for the PAIXP and paid the registration fee,
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/files/downloads/auto/Complete_List_of_Registered_PIAXP_Teams.pdf| title= Registered Teams Overview| publisher=''[[X Prize Foundation]]| accessdate=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by 20 October 2009, the number of teams had decreased to 43, sponsoring 53 vehicles between them.&lt;ref name="progressiveautoxprize.org"/&gt;  These remaining teams represented 10 countries (some entries listed two countries of origin) with 28 coming from the United States and 7 from the state of California.  Of the 53 vehicles, 28 were in the Alternative Classes and 25 in the Mainstream Class.  By 15 April, only 30 teams remained. After the shakedown completed in May, 22 teams remained.&lt;ref name="shakedown"&gt;{{cite web|last=Evarts |first=Eric |title=Automotive X Prize: Final Shakedown results |url=http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2010/05/automotive-x-prize-final-shakedown-results.html |publisher=[[Consumer Reports]] Cars Blog |accessdate=2010-05-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517063031/http://blogs.consumerreports.org/cars/2010/05/automotive-x-prize-final-shakedown-results.html |archivedate=17 May 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A sample of the teams is shown below.

==Career==
Born in [[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville]], [[Illinois]], Affleck was educated in the [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s there.&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt; He did not have much formal higher educational background; one co-industrialist described him as having learned his trade in the "[[school of hard knocks]]".&lt;ref name="JACI"&gt;{{citation|title=Foreword|journal=Journal of the American Concrete Institute|page=8|date=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man, he spent four years working for the Harrison Machine Works company in his home town, leaving afterwards to work for [[American Express]].&lt;ref name="Lesley"/&gt; In 1890, at the age of 21, he joined the Alton Terre Haute Railroad where he worked until 1896, before taking a position at the Illinois Steel Company.&lt;ref name="JACI"/&gt; He was hired initially as a [[machinist]], but rose to the position of sales manager in the cement department with his knack for bringing in profits and business acumen. In 1906, the Illinois Steel Company spun off their cement department, incorporating it as the Universal Portland Cement Company; Affleck continued as sales manager of the new company until 1915, when he became its president.&lt;ref name="Audrey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lesley"/&gt;

On March 2, 1921, Affleck and thirty-nine other officers of [[cement]] corporations were indicted by a federal grand jury under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] for restraint of trade and attempts at monopoly. The companies involved were alleged to have tightly controlled the supply of cement, refusing to sell any builder more than the amount needed for a single job, and preventing them from using any unexpected surplus on other jobs; prices quoted on cement were invariably the same to the penny.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=2 March 1921|accessdate=2008-03-27|periodical=The New York Times|page=1|title=Indict 40 Officers and 74 Companies in Cement 'Trust'|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9401E3D61639E133A25751C0A9659C946095D6CF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Affleck became president of the Universal Atlas Cement Company after its merger with the Universal Portland Cement Company in January 1930; however, he retired from the position just six years later, in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/csmonitor_historic/access/187860092.html?dids=187860092:187860092&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Feb+15%2C+1944&amp;author=Special+to+The+Christian+Science+Monitor&amp;pub=Christian+Science+Monitor&amp;desc=Benjamin+Franklin+Affleck&amp;pqatl=google|periodical=Christian Science Monitor|title=Benjamin Franklin Affleck|date=15 February 1944|accessdate=2008-03-27|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hadley|date=1945|title=The Magic Powder|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1133">A '''bargaining unit''', in [[labor relations]], is a group of employees with a clear and identifiable community of interests who are (under U.S. law) represented by a single [[labor union]] in [[collective bargaining]] and other dealings with management. Examples would be ''non-management professors'', ''law enforcement professionals'', ''blue-collar workers'', ''clerical and administrative employees'', etc.  Geographic location as well as the number of facilities included in bargaining units can be at issue during representation cases.

The size of a company does not relate to the size of a bargaining unit. Bargaining units must consist of at least three employees, and must have the support of a majority of employees in the bargaining unit. However, the bargaining unit can be a small portion of a large company where no other employees are members of a union.

The '''[[Canadian National Railway]] (C.N.) Yards Management Area''' located on Chappell Drive, [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]] consists of the VIA [[Saskatoon railway station]] and the train switching yards.  These yards are a part of the [[Confederation SDA, Saskatoon|Confederation Suburban Development Area (SDA)]].  It lies (generally) north of the outskirts of the City and the [[Rural Municipality]] of [[Corman Park No. 344, Saskatchewan|Corman Park No. 344]], west of [[Montgomery Place, Saskatoon|Montgomery Place]], south of 11th Street and east of [[Saskatchewan Highway 7|Highway 7]].  [[Saskatchewan Highway 7|Highway 7]] has built an overpass over C.N. tracks where they intersect.  This neighbourhood is not to be confused with the [[C.N. Industrial, Saskatoon|C.N. Industrial]] in the [[Nutana SDA, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Nutana SDA]] on the east side of Saskatoon.  These two sides of Saskatoon are connected with the [[Grand Trunk Bridge (Saskatoon)|Grand Trunk Bridge]] or CN railway bridge over the [[South Saskatchewan River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city.saskatoon.sk.ca/org/city_planning/resources/publications/Future_Growth_and_Development_of_Saskatoon.pdf Selling an Idea or a Product] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929104633/http://www.city.saskatoon.sk.ca/org/city_planning/resources/publications/Future_Growth_and_Development_of_Saskatoon.pdf |date=2007-09-29 }} URL accessed January 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

At the intersection of the CNR line and [[Saskatchewan Highway 60|Highway 60]] is the location of the [[Saskatchewan Railway Museum]].

Currently there are CPR switching yards in the [[Central Industrial, Saskatoon|Central Industrial]] neighbourhood.  The City of Saskatoon, [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and the CNR are under negotiations currently to remove these switching yards.  This would mean the CPR could use CNR rail lines through the city and be able to use the CN Chappell Yards for switching.  Likeise the CNR could run trains along the CPR track through the city and use the [[Sutherland Industrial, Saskatoon|Sutherland]] CPR switching yards.  This would involve construction of a connecting switching yard between CP and CN rail lines near 11th Street and Dundonald which could be done as part of the new [[Circle Drive#South bridge|Circle Drive South Bridge]] extension project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Biography ==
Born in [[Milwaukee]], Horngren joined the U.S. Army after high school graduation in 1946. Back in Milwaukee, he obtained his BA in accounting at the [[Marquette University]] in 1949. In 1952 he obtained his MBA from [[Harvard Business School]], and in 1955 his PhD from [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name="CC 2011"/&gt;

After his Marquette University graduation, Horngren had started his career as accountant, and started lecturing accounting at a business college. In 1952 he joined the University of Chicago faculty as lecturer. After his doctorate graduation he taught at [[Marquette University]] and at [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]], and returned to the [[University of Chicago]] as Professor of Accounting. In 1966 he moved to the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]], where he spent the rest of his academic career.&lt;ref name="CC 2011"/&gt;

Inspired by the work of [[William J. Vatter]], Horngren published the influential textbook ''Cost Accounting: A Managerial Emphasis,'' in 1962. This was the first of a number of books on financial and cost accounting Horngren co-authored, which shaped the theory of modern-day management accounting.&lt;ref name="CC 2011"/&gt; Horngren was inducted into the [[Accounting Hall of Fame]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fisher.osu.edu/departments/accounting-and-mis/the-accounting-hall-of-fame/membership-in-hall/charles-thomas-horngren/ Charles Thomas Horngren], The Accounting Hall of Fame.

'''Choi Tae-min''' (5 May 1912 – 1 May 1994) was the leader of a [[South Korea]]n [[cult]] combining elements of [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], and traditional [[Korean Shamanism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3025424&amp;cloc=etc%7Cjad%7Cgooglenews|title=Shamanistic cult linked to president|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Choi, originally a [[Buddhist monk]], then a convert to [[Roman Catholic]]ism, was married six times. He was the mentor of the impeached South Korean president, [[Park Geun-hye]] (the daughter of former president [[Park Chung-hee]]), until his death in 1994. He allegedly used his relationship with Park to solicit bribes from government officials and businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=South Korea's leader acknowledges ties to woman in scandal |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/10/25/south-korea-leader-acknowledges-ties-to-woman-in-scandal.html |date=25 October 2016 |newspaper=[[Fox News]] |access-date=28 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |last=Choe |first=Sang-hun |title=A Presidential Friendship Has Many South Koreans Crying Foul |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/world/asia/south-korea-choi-soon-sil.html?_r=0 |date=27 October 2016 |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |access-date=31 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2016, a [[2016 South Korean political scandal|scandal]] involving his daughter, [[Choi Soon-sil]], broke out, with allegations that she too has exerted undue influence over President Park.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/667320.html|title=Pres.

== History ==
Choi Tae-min set up a religious group called [[Yongsae-gyo]] ({{lang|ko|영세교}}), or “Church of spirit world”, and declared himself [[Maitreya]], or a “Future Buddha.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://justgopoppi.com.br/2016/11/03/o-que-esta-acontecendo-na-coreia-sul-politica-seitas-e-corrupcao/ O que está acontecendo na Coreia do Sul: política, seitas e corrupção]&lt;/ref&gt; He befriended [[Park Geun-hye]] soon after her mother, [[Yuk Young-soo]], was assassinated in 1974. According to a report by the [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|Korean Central Intelligence Agency]] from the 1970s that was published by a South Korean news magazine in 2007, Choi initially approached Park Geun-hye by telling her that her mother had appeared to him in his dreams, asking him to help her daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/821612/a-rasputinesque-mystery-woman-and-a-cultish-religion-could-take-down-south-koreas-president-park-geun-hye/|title=A Rasputinesque mystery woman and a cultish religion could take down South Korea’s president|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Choi was an associate of former-president President Park Chung-hee until the latter's death by assassination in 1979. [[Kim Jae-gyu]], the director of the [[KCIA]] who assassinated President Park Chung-hee, told a court that one of his motives was what he called the president’s failure to stop Choi Tae-min's corrupt activities and keep him away from his daughter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In a newspaper interview in 2007, Park Geun-hye called Choi a patriot and said she was grateful for his counsel and comfort during “difficult times.” 

Also in 2007, a diplomatic cable made public through [[WikiLeaks]], the [[Embassy of the United States, Seoul|American Embassy in Seoul]] reported rumors that Mr. Choi, a 'Korean [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]]', “had complete control over Park’s body and soul during her formative years and that his children accumulated enormous wealth as a result.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2016/10/28/2016102801342.html|title=Leaked U.S. Embassy Cable Warned of 'Rasputin' Behind Park|last=Lim|first=Min-hyuk|date=28 October 2016|newspaper=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|last=Stanton|first=William|authorlink=William Stanton (diplomat)|coauthors=|title=ROK presidential election: Still the politics of the vortex|id={{WikiLeaks cable|07SEOUL2178_a}}|work=|publisher=[[WikiLeaks]]|date=20 July 2007|url=http://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/07SEOUL2178_a.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=28 October 2016|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir '''David Anderson''' (1880&amp;ndash;1953) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[civil engineer]] and [[lawyer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?LinkID=mp79215 Entry at National Portrait Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson was born in 1880 at [[Leven, Fife|Leven]], [[Fife]], [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ice.org.uk/downloads/Presidents%20address%20from%20CE%20with%20Appendices(2).pdf Gordon Masterton's presidential address] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923042309/http://www.ice.org.uk/downloads/Presidents%20address%20from%20CE%20with%20Appendices%282%29.pdf |date=23 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1921, on his return from Army service, Anderson joined a partnership with fellow engineers [[Basil Mott]] and [[David Hay (engineer)|David Hay]], forming the company [[Mott, Hay and Anderson|Mott Hay and Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mottmac.com/aboutmottmac/ourheritage/ Mott MacDonald: Our Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt; Mott, Hay and Anderson traded until 1989, when it merged with [[Sir M MacDonald &amp; Partners]] to form ''[[Mott MacDonald]]''.

Anderson was elected president of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] for the November 1943 to November 1944 session.&lt;ref name="Civils"&gt;{{cite book

'''Design for Availability''' is the design process for a system targeting [[availability]] of the system for guarantying readiness as the major part of goal specification. This design is generally used toward availability based contracts. Design for availability means that design process should start by given parameters of requirement space and maps them to design parameter space. However, the conventional trial and error of parameters set followed by sensitivity analysis might end to the same result area in the design plane.

The design parameters generally include reliability, maintainability of the system. Reliability will be the result of manufacturing of the system where as maintainability is coming from operational, maintenance logistics, [[inventory management]], Prognostic Health Management (PHM) and supply chain design of the services that system require.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calce.umd.edu/calce-enews/2012/calce-enews_march2012.html |title=CALCE e-News March 2012 |publisher=Calce.umd.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general usage of this philosophy of system design is geared toward outcome-based contracts. Availability is the major factor of operational effectiveness along with performance of the system.  Availability based contracts are not as complicated as performance based contract because the discussion over metrics and requirement is less obscure to define for customer and designer. Minimum required availability of complex system is a key factor of many distributed and repairable systems like ATM network or [[Airliner]].

In Availability-based Contracts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/uks-eurofighters-fly-to-availability-based-contracting-04337/ |title=UK’s Eurofighters Fly To Availability-Based Contracting |publisher=Defenseindustrydaily.com |date=2011-12-06 |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of parts, supplier is paid for a guaranteed level of services and performance a and system capability, like availability-based tariff for electric power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fta.dot.gov/documents/Thursday_PM_-_Ronald_Humphrey_-_CRBS-DOT_Round_Table_July_Briefing_Final_RGH.pdf |title=CodeRed Business Solutions |publisher=Fta.dot.gov |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supplier often has to guarantee the availability and preparedness of system at lesser costs by considering the [[logistics]] as part of design. The contractor will also have more control over logistics and [[supply chain]] of system. The key point of using availability instead of Performance is that combining availability of different part of one platform or system from its subsets is feasible and easy unlike dealing with obscure measures of performance in Performance based logistics.

Recent interest in availability contracts that specify a required availability has created an interest in deriving [[system design]] and support parameters directly from an availability-based contracts. But, a point to point allocation from parameter of operation and support to meet availability requirement in the performance space, given the required availability distribution is a direct way of design which must be followed by a [[sensitivity analysis]] and robustness of parameters.  However, determining design parameters from an availability requirement is a stochastic reverse design problem.

Evaluating an availability requirement is a challenge for manufacturers and supporters of systems because determining how to deliver a specific availability is not trivial. The required availability can be defined over the instance of system or over the fleet. It can be defined over different time windows or in different geographical boxes. However availability optimization approaches provide solutions only at selected points in time (not all times), using [[mean time to failure]] (or fixed rate demand) and [[mean time to repair]] as deterministic values as part of [[convex optimization]].

Availability engineering in network world is generally toward reducing unplanned [[downtime]] or planned downtime by providing redundancy or fast switching systems. This area of design is the subject of different discipline with different approach. The main difference between network industry and manufacturing availability is that former is more targeting toward decreasing downtime where as in reliability world it might be seen as using higher reliability part in a cost effective manner.

'''Double counting''' in accounting is an error whereby a transaction is counted more than once, for whatever reason. But in social accounting it also refers to a conceptual problem in social accounting practice, when the attempt is made to estimate the new value added by [[Gross Output]], or the value of total investments.

==What is the problem?==
In the case of a small individual business or having such utility, it is unlikely that an expenditure of funds, an input or output, or an income from production will be counted twice. If it happens, that's usually just bad accounting (a math error), or else a case of fraud.

But things are more complicated when we aggregate the accounts of many enterprises, households and government agencies ("institutional units" or transactors in social accounting language). Here, a conceptual problem arises.

The basic reason is that the ''income'' of one institutional unit is the ''expenditure'' of another, and the ''input'' of one institutional unit is the ''output'' of another.

If therefore we want to measure the total [[value-added]] by all institutional units, we need to devise a consistent procedure for ''grossing and netting'' the incomes and outlays of all units, within a system of transactors. Lacking such a system, we would end up double counting incomes and expenditures of interacting units, exaggerating the quantity of value-added or investments.&lt;ref&gt;Francois Lequiller &amp; Derek Blades, ''Understanding National Accounts''. Paris: OECD, 2006, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

To estimate the annual [[net output]] of a country, for example, the cost of goods and services used up is deducted from gross revenue, all flows are valued uniformly, and flows which fall outside the production boundary are excluded.

==Value theory==
The system of gross and netting actually used, is ultimately based on a [[value theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Utz-Peter Reich, National Accounts and Economic Value. A Study in Concepts. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2001, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; which specifies what may generally count as:

*comparable value (value equivalence)
*value decrease
*value increase
*conserved value 
*transferred value 
*newly created value

In other words, we cannot relate, group and aggregate prices in different ways without making some value-based assumptions that enable valid comparisons. Without those value assumptions, the aggregates themselves would be meaningless. Thus, when economists focus on market-prices, value assumptions are always in the back of their mind, even if they are not aware of that, and regard value theory as [[metaphysics|metaphysical]].

==Counting units==
Once the principles of the value theory are established, categories and counting units can be exactly and logically defined, as a basis for mathematical operations to aggregate the [[stock and flow|flows]] of incomes and expenditures. All flows can then be allocated to their appropriate category, without counting the same flow several times.

In fact, the value theory applied in [[national accounts]] is nowadays strongly influenced by the valuation principles of ordinary business accounts and the prevailing [[social relations]] governing economic exchange, often fixed by law. Thus, for example, it is argued that no new value can result from a ''unilateral'' transfer of funds, i.e. where funds are provided without anything being provided in return.

The implicit assumption made in national accounts, is that the account at the macro-level must be similar to that at the micro-level. Economic relations are regarded as broadly the same at the micro-level and the macro-level. An individual business buys and uses up inputs and produces outputs for sale; it has costs and revenues. Thus, in social accounting all transactors are treated in a similar way ("as if" they were a business). The accounts can be criticised for being eclectic in some ways, but that is not necessarily a problem; the aim of the exercise is to identify and categorise all flows, and the user can then reaggregate them in different ways.

==Persistent double counting problems==
However, even if a consistent system of accounting rules is devised that ''conceptually'' eliminates double counting, double counting may technically still occur to some extent.

*The first and most obvious reason is that, in actual accounting practice, ''boundary problems'' arise, because a flow of expenditures might be ''interpreted'' in different ways, from an accounting point of view. Sometimes, it will not be altogether clear which category a flow of expenditure belongs to exactly, it may not "fit" exactly into a category, or, it is technically impossible to separate out different flows in financial data, in such a way that is required by the social accounting system. This may mean that a flow is, in part or as a whole, inadvertently counted twice, because of difficulties with the data sources.
*We might be able to identify an expenditure quite easily, yet this expenditure may not tally with the corresponding income that should exist, insofar as we can identify it (or vice versa). In that case, we have to make some assumptions or imputations based on what we do know, or can observe. Yet, some statistical discrepancies may remain.
*Statisticians may not be able to keep track of fixed equipment or durables when they are resold by a business to another business after use, locally or overseas. So, the same asset can be counted twice or more. In principle, expenditure on used assets is excluded from capital formation, but in practice it is often included. 
*Another reason has to do with the complexities of trade, in particular trade in services and international trade. Not only can it be difficult to correctly identify, survey and allocate particular financial incomes and expenditures, but also ''revaluations of assets'' occur, creating problems of how to value goods and services as such. At the highest level, due to the expansion of foreign trade, a fraction of ''local'' value-added may consist of the local inflation of ''foreign-produced'' value-added, simply because imported foreign products are resold locally, at inflated prices, without any corresponding additional local production occurring. This may not necessarily create problems of double counting locally, but if we want to estimate ''world'' [[GDP]], we may face double counting problems of some kind.

'''Factory overhead''', also called '''manufacturing overhead''' or '''work overhead''' or American English '''factory burden''', is the total cost involved in operating all production facilities of a [[manufacturing]] business that cannot be traced directly to a product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/277068142|title=A dictionary of business and management.|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199234899|edition=5th|location=Oxford [England]|oclc=277068142}}&lt;/ref&gt; It generally applies to indirect labor and [[Indirect costs|indirect cost]]. Overhead also includes all costs involved in manufacturing with the exception of the cost of raw materials.

'''''First Business''''' (full name '''First Business News''') was a [[television syndication|nationally syndicated]] financial news and analysis [[television program]], produced by First Business Network LLC, a [[subsidiary]] of [[Weigel Broadcasting]], in [[Chicago]]. Anchor [[Angela Miles]], reporters Chuck Coppola and Bill Moller, and executive producer Harvey Moshman brought viewers commentary from the floors of the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] and the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]], as well as from their studios in the [[West Loop]]. The program covered the financial and economic markets including [[equities]], [[Futures contract|futures]], [[option (finance)|options]], [[commodities]], [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]], and [[geo-political]] news.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

The program, which typically aired before local and national [[breakfast television|morning news]] timeslots, had been marginalized as those shows began to start earlier (as early as 4:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.), with ''First Business'' often moved to lower-rated and lower-viewed [[graveyard slot]]s. The program's cancellation ended 47 years of Weigel Broadcasting and their flagship station [[WCIU-TV]] (channel 26) carrying and originating business-focused programming from Chicago.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

==Syndication==
As of the fall 2011 season, the program was carried daily on more than 100 US [[broadcast television|broadcast stations]] and in outlets across 46 foreign countries. The stations included affiliates of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[The CW Television Network|The CW]], [[MyNetworkTV]], as well as independent stations. Air times varied, though the timeslots for the show in the majority of markets was  4:00am through 7:00am leading into early morning national newscasts or local morning newscasts. The only requirement the show enforced was that the program must air before the [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]] opening bell at 9:30am ET (except for Alaska or Hawaii, where time zones necessitated a post-opening bell airing). The show was syndicated by Weigel Broadcasting and sold by Edward. E. Finch &amp; Company.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

==History==
The ''First Business'' program was originally launched in 1989 by BizNet, the broadcast division of the [[US Chamber of Commerce]] in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref name=rf&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.robertfeder.com/2014/11/17/closing-bell-tolls-for-first-business-news/|title=Closing bell tolls for ‘First Business News’ at Weigel Broadcasting|last=[[Robert Feder|Feder, Robert]]|date=17 November 2014|publisher=RobertFeder.com|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its inception through its BizNet years with the US Chamber of Commerce, the First Business program production team was led by BizNet News Director Densil Allen.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

The production of First Business was later taken over from BizNet by [[CONUS Communications]], a joint venture of [[Viacom]] and [[Hubbard Broadcasting]], who would produce the program until 2003.  Barton Eckert hosted the program from CONUS' bureau in Washington, DC, with his anchor segments being fed via satellite to CONUS' headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota, where news packages acquired from CONUS' local member stations nationwide and other sources would be inserted into the program along with Eckert's anchor segments fed in from Washington, with the finished program being delivered via satellite to local stations from St. Paul every weekday.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

In 2003, Weigel Broadcasting took over the program and moved the show to Chicago. With the loss of affiliates for the show due to expanded local morning news, Weigel decided to shut down the program. First Business News last show was produced on December 22, 2014.&lt;ref name=rf/&gt;

==Membership==
Membership of The Institute of Leadership &amp; Management is open to leaders and managers of all levels, including those with no practical experience. There is trial membership — for individuals taking ILM qualifications. Some organisations that are involved with personal development, such as [[The Scout Association]] also highlight the availability of membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/2770/institute-of-leadership-and-management |title=Member resources: Institute of Leadership and Management |publisher=[[The Scout Association]] |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five grades of membership entitle the member to use [[post-nominal letters]] - Affiliate (AInstLM), Associate Member (AMInstLM), Member (MInstLM), Fellow (FInstLM) and Companion (CInstLM). The highest grade is Companionship — for senior executives selected by the Institute. Membership is validated by an official membership certificate.

Members are offered access a range of services to help with their [[Continuous professional development]] (CPD), although this isn't mandatory, including access to e-books, electronic learning materials, and paid-for events.

==Research==
The Institute of Leadership &amp; Management carries out research into leadership and management in practice, providing insights for managers and leaders and publishing findings in white papers, research reports and journals. The institute takes a collaborative approach, preferring to work with like-minded individuals and organisations in defining research topics and undertaking research activity.

==Training and Qualifications==
The Institute of Leadership &amp; Management offers a wide range of learning resources to support the continuous professional development of leaders and managers in a variety of organisations and settings.

Developed over many years of research and insight into best practice, a range of regulated qualifications are now delivered under the distinct 'ILM' brand by the City &amp; Guilds Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exeter.ac.uk/exeterleadersaward/ilm-qualification/ |title=Studying: The Exeter Award: Institute of Leadership and Management qualification |publisher=[[University of Exeter]]|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.somerset.ac.uk/blog/institute-leadership-management-ilm-qualifications-available-at-somerset-college.html |title=Institute of Leadership &amp; Management (ILM) qualifications available at Somerset College |publisher=[[Somerset College of Arts and Technology|Somerset College]]|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/829/page/47292 |title=NLIAH is an approved Institute for Leadership and Management (ILM) Centre |publisher=The National Leadership and Innovation Agency for Healthcare (NLIAH) |date=23 April 2010 |accessdate=11 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518081458/http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/829/page/47292 |archivedate=18 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/explore-by-career/management/training-in-management/|title=NHS Careers: Explore by career: Management: Training in management  |publisher=www.nhscareers.nhs.uk |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aligned to the UK’s [[Qualifications and Credit Framework]] (QCF), ILM qualifications begin at level 2, such as the ILM Award in Team Leading, and continue up to level 7, such as the ILM Diploma in Strategic Leadership and Executive Management. ILM also offers [[National Vocational Qualification|NVQ]]s; these include the Level 5 NVQ in Management. Other specialist qualifications cover skills in volunteer management, business start-up, [[business coaching|coaching]], and personnel management. All ILM qualifications have been accredited by the [[Ofqual|Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation]] (Ofqual).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://register.ofqual.gov.uk/Organisation/Details/RN5143 |title=The Register of Regulated Qualifications: ILM (Institute of Leadership &amp; Management) |publisher=[[Ofqual|Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation]] |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5940">The '''International Rubber Regulation Agreement''' was a 1934 accord between the [[United Kingdom]], [[India]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and [[Thailand]] that formed a [[cartel]] of major rubber producing nations to restrict global [[rubber]] production and maintain a stable, high price for natural rubber.  In 1979 a new agreement was formed - an '''International Natural Rubber Agreement'''.

==Background==
Demand for rubber declined sharply after [[World War I]] resulting in the British enacting the [[Stevenson Plan]] in 1922 to restrict the supply of rubber to support rubber prices and ensure the profitability of British rubber [[plantations]] in the [[Far East]]. However, the plan had many flaws and was abandoned in 1928. By 1928 the plan both irritated the United States and lacked apparent purpose. Demand for rubber was robust due to expanded use of the automobile in the United States.

After the [[stock market crash]] of 1929 the [[Great Depression]] hit the United States and rubber demanded once again softened. It was in this context that the International Rubber Regulation Agreement was implemented.

==The Agreement==
The Agreement was enacted in 1934 between the [[United Kingdom]], [[India]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and [[Thailand]] to restrict the rubber [[supply (economics)|supply]] in accordance with the decline of rubber prices to maintain rubber prices and profitability of rubber producing firms. The agreement both prevented establishment of new [[rubber plantations]] and placed production restrictions on existing plantations. The agreement in effect formed a [[cartel]] of rubber producing nations. To satisfy the interests of the opposite side, the rubber consuming nations, a new institutional body was established: a “Consumer Advisory Council”. Therein representatives of the three leading rubber consuming nations took place: For the [[United States]] this was „The Rubber Manufacturers’ Association of America", for [[Great Britain]] „The India Rubber Manufacturers’ Association of the United Kingdom" and for [[Germany]] the „Reichsverband der deutschen Kautschukindustrie”.&lt;ref&gt;Lammers, Clemens (1937): Internationale Kartelle. Paris: Internationale Handelskammer, p. 12 (p. 9-18: “Die Organisation des Rohkautschukmarktes” = rubber cartel)&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries, e.g. [[Japan]] or the [[Sowjetunion]], had got no representation.

==Outcome==
The United States tried to become independent of the rubber cartel: establishing rubber plantations in territories under its control; conducting research into rubber-producing plants that thrive in the United States' climate; and reinvigorated efforts to replace natural rubber in tires with a synthetic. In the [[Fordlandia venture]], [[Henry Ford]] failed in an attempt to produce rubber in Brazil. The [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]] developed plantations in the [[Philippines]] and [[Costa Rica]] and [[Harvey Firestone]] developed plantations in [[Liberia]].

Research into [[synthetic rubber]] was limited by lack of knowledge of the chemical structure of rubber compounds until after 1945. DuPont had developed neoprene in the 1920s in response to the Stevenson Plan, but neoprene was too costly for making tires. During this period the [[International Rubber Research &amp; Development Board]] and the [[Research Association of British Rubber Manufacturers]] were founded.

Also other technologically advanced countries like [[Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] developed in the interwar period synthetic rubber (e.g. [[Synthetic rubber|Buna]].&lt;ref&gt;Lammers, Clemens (1937): Internationale Kartelle. Paris: Internationale Handelskammer, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; But this was always more expensive than natural rubber.

==International Natural Rubber Agreement, 1979==

'''Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov''' ({{lang-bg|Иван Колчев Калпазанов}}) is an industrialist, ancestor of the modern industry in Gabrovo and Kingdom of Bulgaria (1882).

== Biography ==
Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov was born in 1835 in the village Kalpazani near Gabrovo. His father Kolcho was a merchant who traveled in Bulgaria and Turkey to sell knives. His uncle Ivancho Penchov Kalpazanov was a famous Gabrovian public character.

== Working experience ==
Kolcho Kalpazanov died too young when his elder son Ivan was only 17-year-old. He had to take care for his mother, eight brothers and sisters. Both Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov and his cousin Petko Kalpazanov opened a small shop for different goods as sugar, rice, candles, coffee, textiles, etc. and made a small workshop for clothes there too.

Later Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov studied how to manufacture woollen cords. He became the most skillful manufacturer in Gabrovo.

In 1857 Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov visited the first modern factory in [[Sliven]] (established in 1834) and he decided to build his own textile factory. Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov made his own research for his future factory. On September 21, 1881 Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov met the young [[Vasil Nikolov Karagiosov]] and asked him to find a company for textile machines in [[Germany]], because he was informed that German machines ware of the best technical quality.

[[Vasil Nikolov Karagiosov]] sent a letter signed “To the most famous and celebrated textile company in [[Germany]]”. Accurate German post clerks sent the letter to the town of Chemniz, the factory of Richard Hartman.

Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov realized he could not build the factory all alone because that was an expensive investment. He took for a partner Petko Cokev – a Gabrovian craftsman.

In December 1881 Vasil Karagiosov and Ivan Kalpazanov visited the company of Richard Hartmann, chose suitable machines and signed contracts. Vassil Karagiosov and Ivan Kalpazanov were the men who delivered the first German machines in Gabrovo.

On November 13 and 14, 1882 the first textile factory in Gabrovo was inaugurated.

== Charity ==
Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov donated money for different charity organizations, churches and monasteries.

== Family ==
Ivan Kolchev Kalpazanov and his wife Velika Stojanova had 7 children. The first daughter Deshka married [[Vasil Nikolov Karagiosov]]. The daughter Stojanka married the famous d-r [[Petar Conchev]]. Sons Nikola and Dobri developed active charity activities for the Red Cross in Gabrovo. Today their names are signed by the entrance of the building. The youngest son Dimitar was killed during the [[Balkan Wars]] in 1912.

[[File:Kari-Kairamo-1976.jpg|thumb|right|Kari Kairamo in 1976.]]
'''Kari Antero Oswald Kairamo''', titled ''[[Vuorineuvos]]'' (31 December 1932  [[Helsinki]] in [[Finland]], &amp;ndash; 11 December 1988 in [[Espoo]], [[Finland]]), was a Chairman and CEO of [[Nokia|Nokia Corporation]] and a significant and popular person in the industry, who was also actively involved in [[Finland]]'s foreign policy.

==Biography==

===Career===
Kari Kairamo had a master's degree in engineering (wood processing). Early on in his career, he had leading positions in several international firms in the paper industry. Nokia hired him in 1967, when it was still a major player in the forest industry. In 1977, Kairamo became CEO of Nokia after [[Björn Westerlund]] retired. Kairamo's mission was to build Nokia fast into an internationally large multi-industry company, and he led several courageous [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]] for the company.

The late 1980s was a very special period of time both for the Nokia Corporation and for Finland. The place Finland occupied on the map of [[Europe]] was about to change, and cold war and protectionism in the Finnish trade politics was about to break down. Kairamo saw the importance of Nokia, the biggest company in Finland, as a major agent in getting Finland closer to Western Europe, although at the same time he considered the [[Soviet Union]] to be an important trade partner and managed to retain close relations with major Soviet politicians and business leaders.

===Death===
Kari Kairamo committed [[suicide]] by hanging himself in his home on 11 December 1988, an act which Nokia at first attempted to hide. His sudden death by his own hand only served to strengthen his already legendary image. He had endless amount of energy and a stunning work efficiency. Suffering from [[bipolar disorder]] is also a commonly suspected reason for his tragic decision. As he was part of the Kihlman family, famous for their artists, some people close to the family suspect he was manic-depressive like many great artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cord|first=David|title=[[The Decline and Fall of Nokia]]|date=April 2014|publisher=Schildts &amp; Söderströms|location=Helsinki|isbn=978-951-52-3320-2|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Knowledge process outsourcing''' ('''KPO''') 

(Outsourcing of job that require knowledge,skill, expertise. The work in KPO involves process like market research, survey analysis, data mining etc. ).             information-related business activities&lt;ref name="Ivey"&gt;{{cite web|title=The benefits and risks of knowledge process outsourcing |publisher=Ivey Business Journal |url=http://www.iveybusinessjournal.com/topics/strategy/the-benefits-and-risks-of-knowledge-process-outsourcing |date=May–June 2010 |accessdate=2012-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422191917/http://www.iveybusinessjournal.com/topics/strategy/the-benefits-and-risks-of-knowledge-process-outsourcing |archivedate=2012-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are competitively important or form an integral part of a company's [[value chain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sourcing cheaper staff the new groth industry|publisher=The Sidney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/sourcing-cheaper-staff-the-new-growth-industry-20120127-1qlou.html|date=2012-01-28|accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mierau"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mierau|first=Alexander|title=Strategic Importance of Knowledge Process Outsourcing|publisher=Technical University of Kaiserslautern|url=http://www.hrotoday.com/pdf/white-papers/Strategic-Implications-of-KPO.pdf|date=2007-01-17|accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Now, BPO moves up the value chain|publisher=The Economic Times|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2005-04-17/news/27485579_1_kpo-process-outsourcing-indian-bpo|date=2005-08-17|accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Reasons behind KPO include an increase in specialized knowledge and expertise,&lt;ref name="Ivey" /&gt; additional value creation,&lt;ref name="Mierau" /&gt; the potential for cost reductions, and a shortage of skilled labor.&lt;ref name="Ivey" /&gt; Regions which are particularly prominent in Knowledge Process Outsourcing include India, Sri Lanka, and Eastern Europe, especially Poland, Romania, and the Baltic States.&lt;br /&gt;KPO is a continuation of [[Business process outsourcing]], yet with rather more of business complexity. To be successful in Knowledge process outsourcing, a lot of guide is required from [[interorganizational system]].&lt;ref name="Ghosh, Biswadip"&gt;{{cite web|title= Knowledge process outsourcing|publisher=Ghosh, Biswadip, ACIS 2009 Proceedings Paper 52.|url=http://aisel.aisnet.org/acis2009/52/|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
KPO services include all kinds of research and information gathering,e.g. [[intellectual property]] research for patent applications; [[equity research]], business and [[market research]], legal and medical services; training, consultancy, and [[research and development]] in fields such as [[pharmaceutical]]s and [[biotechnology]]; and animation and design, etc.{{sfn|Sornarajah|Wang|2010|p=280}}

==Importance==
The developing rivalry has brought about shorter time to market cycles, and clients are getting to be more demanding regarding quality. This has constrained the firms to give operational proficiency and increase the value of their products and services. The customer can launch an item quicker and get to the market immediately. A company can lessen the complexities included in overseeing and constantly constructing information in an extensive pool of [[human resources]].{{sfn|Vijay Kumar Kaul|2011|p=150}}

== Risks and benefits ==
'''Benefits'''&lt;ref name="Prasad Kakumanu and Anthony Partanova "&gt;{{ cite web|title= Outsourcing Its Benefits, Drawbacks and Other Related Issues| publisher=Prasad Kakumanu and Anthony Partanova, Journal of American Academy of Business, Cambridge| url=http://doc.mbalib.com/view/21ad1bc5b227f95dd5e778a416b1c04f.html|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cost reduction
* Shortage of skilled employees
* Provides many graduates at very low cost
* High end services are provided at a lower cost to decrease unemployment and benefit their economy 
* Provide flexibility in terms of HRM &amp; time management

'''Risks'''&lt;ref name="Prasad Kakumanu and Anthony Partanova"/&gt;
* Security- Classified information about the company can be lost
* Key talent retention
* The character of the employee and the quality of the work cannot be assured
* KPO is time consuming and cannot provide a quick fix to the company seeking immediate results.
* Lack of communication between partners due to  legal, language and cultural barriers can lead to complications
*Quality of Personnel and Work Cannot Be Guaranteed  
*Shortage of Skilled Employees 
*Reduction in Communication due to Language barrier 
*Inability to protect company's intellect property 

==Differentiation from BPO==
A KPO firm requires considerably more skilled personnel than a [[Business process outsourcing|BPO]] firm. Experts working in KPO keep on learning and accomplished professionals can power their aptitude to produce more incomes for the KPO firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How does KPO differ from BPO |url=http://www.outsource2experts.com/PDFS/How_does_KPO_differ_from_BPO.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127102726/http://www.outsource2experts.com/PDFS/How_does_KPO_differ_from_BPO.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference between a KPO firm and a BPO firm is that in a KPO firm, the customer is included amid the whole execution process.{{sfn|Vijay Kumar Kaul|2011|p=150}}

== Origin of the term ==
Out of all those who say they coined the term, Ashish Gupta, COO of Evalueserve has the best claim. Published authors have credited him for coining the term in their works.&lt;ref name="HRKPO"&gt;{{cite web|title=HR Practice Scenario in Indian KPOs |publisher=Global Business and Management Research: An International Journal |volume=1(2) |page=44 |date=2009 |url=http://www.universal-publishers.com/book.php?method=ISBN&amp;book=1599428997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In India ==
India has a large number of post-graduates, PhDs and MBAs who are involved in KPO. The Indian National Association of Software and Service Companies ([[NASSCOM]]) estimated the total market size of the KPO sector in India in 2006 to be $1.5 billion.{{sfn|Contractor|Kumar|Kundu|2010|p=53}}  The year before, 2005, it had been $1.3 billion, with [[Evalueserve]] predicting that by 2010 it would be some $10 to $15 billion.{{sfn|Mehrotra|2005|p=46}}  The Indian government was predicting that by 2010 India would have 15% of the global KPO market.{{sfn|Basu|2009|p=80}}  However, [[Late-2000s recession|the global financial crisis]], coupled with domestic economic problems such as the [[initial public offering|IPO]] of [[Reliance Power]] in 2009, caused people to re-evaluate these predictions, incurring worries that India's IT, BPO, and KPO sectors &amp;mdash; which by then, combined, were $8.4 billion in [[export revenue]]s &amp;mdash; would be greatly affected by these factors.{{sfn|Varadarajan|2010|p=145&amp;ndash;146}} The worldwide KPO industry is expected to reach about US $17 billion by 2015, of which US $12 billion would be outsourced to India. Furthermore, the Indian KPO area is likewise anticipated that it will utilize more than 2, 50,000 KPO experts by 2015.&lt;ref name= "SIES"&gt;{{cite web| title= SEIS Journal of management| url= http://www.siescoms.edu/journals/siescoms/Journal1.pdf| p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenges===

The KPO area has a considerable measure of potential for development in India. But India confronts various difficulties to secure itself as a worldwide KPO pioneer. The real test in setting up a KPO will be to obtain skilled employees. KPO organizations include high risk and confidentiality and the greater part of the work would be outsourced from the US. The area likewise obliges larger amount of control, confidentiality and enhanced risk management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Challenges for Indian Companies in the Financial Services KPO Business|url= http://www.crisil.com/crisil-young-thought-leader-2005/dissertations/Smita-Bhattacharya_Dissertation.pdf|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, legal language and cultural barriers can result in genuine issues. Both organizations need to appreciate each other's corporate and national societies and find common helpful approaches to create successful participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Emergence and Potential of Knowledge Process Outsourcing in India| author= S.Venkatesh| url= http://journalijar.com/uploads/2014-01-01_011729_893.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the Philippines ==
The Philippines Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO) services are often called "non-voice" or back office services, referring to activities outside contact center, customer and IT support services. In 2014, the KPO sector comprised 40 percent of the country's outsourcing industry. The Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing Association of the Philippines (IBPAP) predicts that the Philippine outsourcing sector will reach $25 billion in revenues and employ about 1.3 million people by 2016.&lt;ref name= "COSS"&gt;{{cite web| title= SourceFit| url= http://www.sourcefit.com/blog/why-the-philippines-is-emerging-as-a-leading-destination-for-knowledge-process-outsourcing#sthash.8P2V7DcX.dpuf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like India's KPO industry, the Philippine KPO sector has evolved along similar lines. Starting with contact center services and low-value back office work like data entry and IT maintenance, the country is now considered an established destination for animation and design and content/publishing KPO services (Sathe and Aradhana, Sourcingmag.com). Back office and non-voice services contributed $1.1 billion in revenues to the country's outsourcing sector in 2009. Former IBPAP executive director for information research Gillian Virata said that the Philippine KPO industry is expected to reach the same market size as the voice service sector by 2015-2016. Non-voice services are already growing at a faster rate than traditional voice services. 

===Non-voice services===
'''Banking and Finance Services''' 
The banking and financial services industry is leading KPO activity in the country, with global financial institutions providing underwriting, research and analytics, training and consulting, profit and loss, risk mitigation, and other BFSI-related services. KPO vendors also provide strategic research, market research, financial services research, analytics, and competitive intelligence monitoring. 

'''Legal Services''' 
Companies from the Philippines are expected to compete strongly with Indian providers of legal and paralegal services to the United States. Besides its cultural affinity with the West and excellent English proficiency of its talent pool, the Philippines used to be an American colony, and its laws are patterned after those of the U.S. Integreon is an established legal services provider in the country, specializing in discovery, contract management, compliance, legal research and knowledge management, intellectual property, and due diligence. 

'''Medical Services and Research and Development''' 
Many Chinese research and development pharmaceutical firms have set up offices in Metro Manila due to relatively lower rental and operating costs compared to traditional destinations. The country also has a pool of 250,000 nursing graduates, about half of which are expected to be employed in the healthcare services sector in 2016.&lt;ref name= "HIMO"&gt;{{cite web| title= Philippines Healthcare Info. Management| url= http://www.dict.gov.ph/healthcare-information-management-outsourcing-association-of-the-philippines/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animation and Design''' 
The Philippines has established itself as a successful [[Filipino cartoon and animation|Animation and Design]] outsourcing destination. The [[Animation Council of the Philippines]] estimates that global animation industry revenues have been growing at 20 to 30 percent over the past few years, increasing demand for low-cost, highly skilled creative labor. The rise of the animation outsourcing industry in the Philippines began in the early 1980s, with FilCartoons, Burbank Animation Inc. and Asian Animation setting up operations in the country and providing animation exports to foreign companies. In 2008, the Philippines had over 50 animation companies, mostly small and medium-sized companies. Larger animation companies include [[Toei Animation|TOEI Animation]], Roadrunner and [[Toon City|Toon City Animation Inc.]], which employs about 1,300 animators and artists (about 18 percent of the country's animation labor pool. Overall, the Philippines employed about 7,000 people in the animation sector in 2008 and generated up to US$97 million in 2006 and US$105 million in 2007.&lt;ref name= "THOLONS"&gt;{{cite web| title= The Philippines Animation Industry|url= http://www.tholons.com/nl_pdf/150508_philippine_Animation_Industry.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Eastern Europe ==
Although India has traditionally been a KPO destination for North American, British, and Australian companies, an increasing number of European companies are looking to Eastern Europe, especially the Baltic countries, to satisfy their KPO needs.&lt;ref&gt;"Outsourcing market in Eastern Europe heats up" Oct. 17, 2012. http://www.bpmwatch.com/columns/outsourcing-market-in-eastern-europe-heats-up/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="108331">This is a list of [[cooperative banking|co-operative banks]] in Germany according to the information provided by the [[Bundesverband der Deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken]] (BVR) umbrella organisation.

By late 2008, there were 1,197 co-operative banks in Germany with total assets of €668 billion.

German co-operative banks are members of regional organisations. These organisations are responsible for additional support of the local bank (such as specialised salesforces or providing further education for the bank staff) as well as acting as an audit body in compliance with [[German banking]] law.

Born 7 September 1969, Hayek is a telecoms executive and digital economy specialist who was part of the team that built the first [[GSM]] network in [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="BusinessYear"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thebusinessyear.com/lebanon-2012/the-next-step/interview |title=The Next Step |date=January 2012 |work=The Business year |publisher=TBY |access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marwan has over 18 years experience in the telecom sector across the [[MENA]] region. 

==Education==
Hayek holds a master's degree in [[Telecommunications]] and [[Electrical Engineering]] from the [[Faculte Polytechnique de Mons]] in Belgium. He attended and participated in several technical, IT and Management trainings including CCL, MEIRC, HEC, [[INSEAD]], [[MIT]] &amp; [[Harvard]].&lt;ref name="SuperBitar"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://superbitar.wordpress.com/tag/ceo/ |title=Marwan Hayek, Alfa’s New Chairman &amp; CEO |date=April 2010 |work=Lebanon Opportunities |publisher=Infopro sal. |access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Hayek started his career with [[France Telecom]] in Lebanon – Cellis, known currently as Alfa, where he was part of the initial team that built the first GSM network in Lebanon, before joining later on the [[Orascom Telecom Holding]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="BusinessYear2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thebusinessyear.com/lebanon-2012/wired-up/vip-interview |title=Wired Up |date=July 2012 |work=The Business year |publisher=TBY |access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek has held several assignments within the Orascom Telecom Group’s subsidiaries and its Holding, the latest before his current appointment was in September 2007, where he joined [[Mobinil]] - Egypt as VP Technology in charge of both network and IT infrastructure.

Prior to Mobinil, Hayek was the CTO of [[Mobilink]] in [[Pakistan]] (an OTH subsidiary) between June 2003 and September 2007. Between 2000 and 2002, Hayek was part of the team who built [[Sabafon]]’s network in [[Yemen]] in the position of CTO. Under Hayek, OTH grew to over 120M subscribers.

Hayek took the helm of [[Alfa (Lebanon)|Alfa]], the first Lebanese mobile operator managed by [[Orascom Telecom]], as its chairman and CEO, since the beginning of March 2010.&lt;ref name="ArabCom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arabcommunications.com/dialDetails.asp?id=1&amp;catid=35|title=Interview with Marwan Hayek - CEO and Chairman of ALFA |date=8 August 2011 |work=Arab Communication Consult |publisher=ACC |access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TelcoReview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telecomreviewna.com/index.php/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=315:telecom-review-summit-draws-world-telecom-leaders&amp;catid=45:january-2013&amp;Itemid=90 |title=Telecom Review Summit Draws World Telecom Leaders |date=15 January 2013 |work=Telecom Review |publisher=Trace Media |access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He led the introduction of the 3G+&lt;ref name="DailyStar2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Business/Lebanon/2011/Oct-26/152215-alfa-launches-long-awaited-3g-services-for-mobile-phone-clients.ashx |title=Alfa Launches Long-Awaited 3G Services |date=26 October 2011 |work=The Daily Star |publisher=Daily Star |access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; technology that was first launched in October 2011&lt;ref name="Marcopolis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marcopolis.net/alfa-lebanon-on-telecom-sector-3g-and-regulations.htm |title=Alfa Lebanon on Lebanese Telecom Sector, 3G and Regulations |date=24 September 2012 |work=Marcopolis |publisher=Marcopolis, LLC |access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the introduction of 4G-LTE technology in May 2013. The Lebanese internet cable networks do not currently support fibre optics and the introduction of 3G+ followed by 4G-LTE gave access to the Lebanese people to high-speed internet.&lt;ref name="MediaME"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediame.com/en/news/digital_media/lebanese_telecom_sector_supports_rapid_growth_digital_market |title=Lebanese Telecom Sector Supports The Rapid Growth Of The Digital Market |date=17 March 2013 |work=Arab Net |publisher=Media ME |access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1999, following the winning of the Management Agreement of Alfa by Orascom Telecom in February 2009 and in addition to his position at Mobinil, Hayek was appointed on the board of MIC1-Lebanon and Orascom Telecom Lebanon. Since November 2014, he also sits at the board of directors of WIS Telecom (an OTMT international carrier subsidiary operating out of Belgium and Italy).

The mobile penetration rate in Lebanon is close to saturation, indexed at 94% as per beginning year 2016.&lt;ref name="TelRev"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telecomreview.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=1964 |title=Moving To The Next Level Through Digital Transformation |date=1 February 2016 |work=Telecom Review |publisher=Telecom Review |access-date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political Controversy ==

In 2015 there was a controversy where the Governmental Tender Office claimed that Hayek did not submit the tender for the renewal of Alfa's governmental regulated contract on time and the Prime Minister's office disqualified Orascom from taking part in the bidding. The [[Shura Council]] cancelled the decision and ordered the Tender Office to endorse the company’s application. The council also urged it to conduct a public and equally competitive bid.&lt;ref name="Daily Star"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Business/Local/2015/Oct-07/318026-decision-banning-alfa-operator-from-telecom-tenders-annulled.ashx |title=Decision Banning Alfa Operator From Telecom Tenders Annulled |date=7 October 2015 |work=The Daily Star |publisher=The Daily Star |access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BusinessNews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessnews.com.lb/cms/Story/StoryDetails.aspx?ItemID=5167 |title=Alfa’s Orascom To Rejoin Telecom Tender |date=8 October 2015 |work=Business News |publisher=InfoPro sal. |access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The telecom operators in Lebanon are government regulated and have to go back to the Minister of Telecommunications whenever they want to invest in the network.&lt;ref name="CommsMEA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commsmea.com/13744-eye-on-lebanon/ |title=Eye On Lebanon |date=25 September 2013 |work=The CommsMEA |publisher=ITP Business Publishing Ltd. |access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
Hayek has received several awards in recognition of his contributions to the telecom sector’s development in [[Lebanon]] and the MENA region. 
In June 2011, he was awarded the Pan Arab “Telecommunications Man of the Year” title by the “Pan Arab Web Awards Academy.”&lt;ref name="TMY"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blog.africantelecomsnews.com/2011/06/marwan-hayek-is-telecommunications-man.html |title=Marwan Hayek is ‘Telecommunications Man of the Year’ (Lebanon) |date=15 June 2011 |work=Mark Thomas |publisher=African Telecom News |access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Innes brewing and bottling businesses not only produced alcoholic beverages, but "aerated waters," thus making a start to the soft-drink industry in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/hamilton-news/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503366&amp;objectid=11107037 "Soft Drink Empire Founder Inducted"] ''Hamilton News'' (10 August 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandson [[Harold Hirst Innes]] was senior director of Innes Industries in 1961, when they merged with another company to create Oasis Group.&lt;ref&gt;Julie P.

==Personal life and legacy==
Mary Jane Lewis married Scotsman Charles Innes in [[Auckland]] in 1874. They had ten children together.  She was widowed in 1899. Mary Jane Innes died in Auckland in 1941, age 89. Her remains were buried in Hamilton East Cemetery.&lt;ref name="DNZB Innes"/&gt;

In 2013, she was inducted into the New Zealand Business Hall of Fame, 72 years after her death.&lt;ref name="Female entrepreneur"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slade|first1=Maria|title=Female entrepreneur in a man's world|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/better-business/8730246/Female-entrepreneur-in-a-mans-world|accessdate=29 December 2014|work=[[The Press]]|date=29 May 2013|page=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Business Hall of Fame, Past Laureates, [http://www.businesshalloffame.co.nz/past-laureates/innes-mary/ Mary Innes].&lt;/ref&gt;

Objects and papers belonging to Innes and her family are part of the collection in the [[Waikato Museum]].&lt;ref name="Waikato" /&gt; Mary Jane's grandson Colin V. Innes co-wrote a book about the family's early history in brewing, ''A Crown for the Lady: The Unravelling of a Pioneer Story'' (Tauranga: Moana Press, 1989).&lt;ref&gt;Colin V. Innes and Kieran P.

A '''Multi-evaporator system''' is a [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] system generally consisting of four major components:
* 1.[[Evaporator]]
* 2.[[Gas compressor|Compressor]]
* 3.[[Condenser (heat transfer)|Condenser]]
* 4.[[Thermal expansion valve]]

Sometimes in a refrigerator several loads are varied. Refrigerators used to function at different loads operated under different condition of temperatures and pressures. There may be arrangements possible for multi evaporators on the basis of single or multi compressors. If refrigerant from each evaporator compressed in the same single compressor then it is called as Multi-evaporator single-compressor system.

== Single Compressor-Individual Expansion Valve==
A two evaporator single compressor with ''individual expansion valves'' for each evaporator after passing through the back pressure valve enters into the compressors and hence there is a significant rise in temperature is observed. 
This system helps in dropping the pressure from high pressure evaporators with the help of back pressure valves. The high pressure ratio is obtained which necessarily compresses the vapor to high extent from the higher temperature evaporators to condenser temperature. This kind of refrigerator has greater application in load varying purpose. Moreover, high value of COP and better operating economy is observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Refrigertion and air conditi|last=A|first=D|publisher=df|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=sfs|last=fs|first=sf|publisher=sds|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass flow rate through evaporators :-

m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=Heat through evaporator 1(Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)÷(specific enthalpy difference in evaporator 1)

m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=Heat through evaporator 1(Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)÷(specific enthalpy difference in evaporator 2))

The net Work done is :-
*  W = (Sum of masses through evaporator 1 and evaporator 2)*(specific enthalpy difference in compressor)
*  W = (m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)*(h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)

'''Nicandro Durante''' (born 13 September 1956) is a Brazilian businessman, the chief executive (CEO) of [[British American Tobacco]] plc (informally BAT), the world's largest tobacco company by sales.

==Early life==
Durante was born in Goias, Brazil, and is of Italian ancestry. Durante has a bachelor's degree in Finance, Economics and Business Administration from the [[Pontifícia Universidade Católica de São Paulo]]. 

==Career==
Durante joined BAT's Brazilian subsidiary Souza Cruz in 1981. In January 2008, he was appointed BAT's chief operating officer, and in March 2011 became chief executive.  In late 2018 BAT announced that Durante would retire at the end of March 2019. &lt;ref name="FT_012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c7ae8b88-0960-11e2-a5e3-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2AmHd92bO|title=The running man of Big Tobacco|date=30 September 2012|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durante is BAT's first non-British CEO. During his tenure as CEO, BAT's share price has doubled. &lt;ref name="cigar2" /&gt; It collapsed in 2018 as it appeared he had misjudged the FDA's attitude towards menthol cigarettes and that BAT had hopelessly overpaid in the acquisition of the Reynolds minorities in July 2017 (at the time the largest ever foreign investment into a US firm).  His retirement came at a highly controversial time in the firms history. 

In 2015 he took home almost £8 million &lt;ref name="BAT chief pay jumps2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/03/22/bat-chiefs-pay-jumps-by-1m-despite-shareholder-backlash/|title=BAT chief pay jumps|date=22 March 2016|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 he asked for a raise to reach £10 million saying he deserves another £2 million &lt;ref name="BAT chief pay jumps2" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Durante enjoys cigar-smoking, the opera, running and playing football. He is married with two children. &lt;ref name="cigar2"&gt;{{citenews|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c27c2de4-977a-11e6-a1dc-bdf38d484582|title=The cigar-smoking, football-playing Brazilian behind Reynolds bid|last=Shubber|first=Kadhim|date=October 21, 2016|newspaper=Financial Times|accessdate=February 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Ondo State Wealth Creation Agency''' (WECA) was established in 2009 by the [[Olusegun Mimiko|Mimiko]] administration in response to the quest for economic diversification and the creation of employment in areas relating to Agriculture &amp; Food Security. It was created from the defunct Accelerated Poverty Alleviation Agency.&lt;ref name="iita.org"&gt;http://www.iita.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/The-Bulletin-21-February-2014-No.-2212-Special-Issue.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  and is designed to develop policies and programs that foster youth participation in Agricultural entrepreneurship in [[Ondo State]]. In 2016 the Youth development programs of the agency earned the commendation of the [[African Development Bank]].&lt;ref name="businessdayonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdayonline.com/news/article/ondo-to-partner-with-afdb-on-youth-empowerment/|title=Ondo to partner with AfDB on youth empowerment - BusinessDay : News you can trust|author=|date=9 March 2016|website=businessdayonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
WECA exercises management supervisory control over the Ondo State Agro Business Cities ABCs. Through the ABCs, WECA facilitates financial aid for agribusinesses, from the state government, and trains youths on modern agricultural methods while exposing the trainees to the entire [[value chain]] of agriculture through the initiatives. WECA designs platforms and implements policies for wealth creation through aggressive promotion of small scale enterprises and indigenous products and services via four initiatives known as the Pro-farmers &amp; Agro-preneurs Sustainable Scheme through Agro Business Cities (P.A.S.S.THRU ABC’s), the Adiye/Eja WECA Promo, the Made in Ondo Brand Promo and the Wealth CreationFund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/12/olusegun-mimikos-ondo-state-as-africas-model-of-development/|title=Olusegun Mimiko’s Ondo state as Africa’s model of development|author=|date=16 December 2015|website=[[Vanguard (Nigeria)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="guardian.ng"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://guardian.ng/appointments/weca-trains-100-profarmers-agropreneurs-in-ondo/|title=WECA trains 100 profarmers, agropreneurs in Ondo| date=3 March 2016|work= [[The Guardian (Nigeria)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; WECA functions to drive industrialization and employment opportunities in Ondo State through the establishment and management of agro allied industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenationonlineng.net/ondo-state-govt-tackle-unemployment-agriculture/|title=Ondo State Govt. to tackle unemployment through agriculture|author=|date=6 April 2016|work=[[The Nation (Nigeria)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2016/03/28/ondo-begins-lawyers-wigs-production-eyes-nba-deal/|title=Ondo Begins Lawyers’ Wigs Production, Eyes NBA Deal |author=|date=28 March 2016|work=[[This Day]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agro Business Cities (ABC)===
Under the [[Olusegun Mimiko|Mimiko]] administration, WECA re-modelled the farm settlement concept, introduced by [[Obafemi Awolowo]] under the [[Western State (Nigeria)|old Western Region]], [[Nigeria]], and established four modern farm settlements called Agro Business Cities (ABCs). These settlements are the Ore Agro Business City in [[Odigbo]] Local Government area in the South Senatorial District, Epe Agro Business City in [[Ondo East]] Local Government Area in the Central Senatorial District, Isuada and Auga Agro Business Cities in [[Owo]] and [[Akoko]] North East Local Government Areas respectively, in the North Senatorial District.&lt;ref name="tribuneonlineng.com"/&gt; Agricultural practices being carried out in the four Agro business cities include poultry, fishery, cattle rearing, arable farming, sericulture, and apiculture.&lt;ref name="thebreakingtimes.com"/&gt;
The Agro Business Cities are established across the state as training and business incubation centres for Agriculture and Agribusinesses and are mandated with the task of teaching the trainees, under the Pro-farmers and Agro-preneurs Scheme. The ABCs include modern accommodation, amenities, and recreation facilities for participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/03/investing-agriculture-mimiko/|title=Why we are investing in agriculture — Mimiko - Vanguard News|author=|date=3 March 2014|website=vanguardngr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.latestnigeriannews.com/news/69514/agrotourism-wonder-in-ondo-stateas-mimiko-turns-jungle-to-city-employs-1087-grad.html|title=Agro-tourism wonder in Ondo State:As Mimiko turns jungle to city ,Employs 1,087 graduate.|first=|last=|date=|website=Latest Nigerian News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Agro Business Cities are deliberately created to have an ambience which youths would find attractive.&lt;ref name="tribuneonlineng.com"/&gt; In 2016, the facilities and infrastructure at the business cities were commended by officials of the [[African Development Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdayonline.com/news/article/ondo-to-partner-with-afdb-on-youth-empowerment/|title=Ondo to partner with AfDB on youth empowerment - BusinessDay : News you can trust|author=|date=9 March 2016|website=businessdayonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ore Agro Business City was chosen as the model ABC as a result of its strategic location in southwest Nigeria, and the acquisition of a 30 megawatts power plant for the Ore Industrial City, by the administration.&lt;ref name="thebreakingtimes.com"/&gt; The Ore ABC spans over 3, 500 hectares of land, and was upgraded to international standards through its partnership with the [[International Institute of Tropical Agriculture|International Institute of Tropical Agriculture IITA]] and other institutions in 2014. &lt;ref&gt; Agreement signed between Ondo State Wealth Creation Agency (WECA) and IITA for “Upgrading Ondo State Agricultural Village, Ore”-  IITA 2014 annual report, IITA&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the IITA Youths Agripreneurs IYA program and the Wealth Creation Agency Program collaborated to train youths in Agribuisnesses at the Ore Agribusiness City. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iitayouthagripreneurs.wordpress.com/2015/01/|title=January - 2015 - IITA Youth Agripreneurs|author=|date=|website=iitayouthagripreneurs.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://agronigeria.com.ng/mimiko-drive-youth-employment-flag-1000-hectares-cassava-farmland/|title=Mimiko To Drive Youth Employment With Flag-off of 1,000 Hectares Cassava Farmland - AgroNigeria|first=|last=peace|date=8 September 2014|website=agronigeria.com.ng}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ore ABC is one of the sites for the Ondo State Oil Palm Revolution.&lt;ref name="vanguardngr.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/09/our-involvement-in-agriculture-transformed-our-thinking-weca-participants/|title=Our involvement in agriculture transformed our thinking - WECA participants - Vanguard News|author=|date=21 September 2012|website=vanguardngr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://agronigeria.com.ng/food-crisis-related-to-world-leaders-by-fao/|title=0.8 Million Palm Seedlings form Malaysia Distributed to Ondo Farmers - AgroNigeria|first=|last=agronigeria|date=3 October 2012|website=agronigeria.com.ng}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Auga ABC includes a cattle ranch and goatry, for meat production and processing. Thousands of pro-farmers have been trained at the ABCs by WECA. &lt;ref name="guardian.ng"/&gt;

===The Profarmers &amp; Agropreneurs Sustainable Scheme (P.A.S.S)===
The Profarmers &amp; Agropreneurs Sustainable Scheme (P.A.S.S.) was launched on the 19th of May 2014 by the [[Olusegun Mimiko|Mimiko]] administration. Under the scheme, young graduates are assigned to the Agro Business Cities and other units under WECA for training and practical knowledge. Between 18-24 months, the trainees are taught the business of agriculture through the entire value chain of agricultural finance, supply of input, production, preservation, and processing, packaging, marketing, distribution, and other services including export. The Ondo State government provides all the agricultural inputs and basic facilities such as land, accommodation, land, electricity and training under the scheme.&lt;ref name="tribuneonlineng.com"/&gt; The participant is paid a monthly stipend, in collaboration with the [[Federal government of Nigeria|Nigerian Federal Government]] under the [[SURE-P]] Graduate Internship Scheme (GIS). The Pro farmers Agropreneurs Sustainable Scheme is a participation-ownership scheme where the participants develop agro-enterprises wholly funded by WECA. The trainees are entitled to profits from the proceeds of sale of agricultural products they produce during their stay in the agro business cities, while the capital is injected back into the business. The farm produce is bought at competitive market prices by the Ondo state government.&lt;ref name="vanguardngr.com1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2367">A '''Prime Ministerial Trade Envoy''' is a position in British foreign policy, within the [[Department for International Trade]] since 2016, and formerly with the [[UK Trade &amp; Investment]] [[government department]] from 2003 to 2016. &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bis.gov.uk/Press-Releases/New-trade-envoys-and-business-investment-to-boost-trade-links-68328.aspx BIS - Press Releases - New trade envoys and business investment to boost trade links&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade Envoys are appointed by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in order to promote British business and trade interests abroad. The [[Special Representative for International Trade and Investment]] is a currently dormant position previously held by a member of the [[British Royal Family]], who had the responsibility of representing the Sovereign for trade purposes. Following the 2012 Cabinet reshuffle, [[Ken Clarke]] was made a roving trade envoy, focusing on promoting British expertise to emerging economies, in particular [[China]] and [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19918533 BBC News - Ken Clarke given trade envoy role&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Restructuring}}

'''Reconstruction''' in [[law]] refers typically to the transfer of a company's (or several companies') business to a new company. The old company will get put into liquidation, and shareholders will agree to take shares of equivalent value in the new company.

In [[UK company law]], the governing provisions are in the [[Insolvency Act 1986]], ss. 110–111. The sanction of a court is not required (unlike under a so-called "[[scheme of arrangement]]", which could or creditors). Yet if a shareholder objects, he or she may require a cash payment instead of shares. Creditors who object to have their debts transferred to a new company can demand satisfactions during the old company's liquidation.

Small private companies, family companies and investment trusts often use the procedure. The purposes can vary, from changing the objects of the business, varying share class rights, or reorganize before a [[demerger]] takes place.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2589">'''Securities and Exchange Board Of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996''' is a set of regulations in [[India]] that govern [[mutual fund]]s. It is enforced by the [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]] (SEBI). The regulations have been primarily designed to protect the investors.&lt;ref name="VIJ"&gt;{{cite book|author=VIJ|title=Merchant Banking and Financial Services|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i6T4HSUFzR4C&amp;pg=PA264|accessdate=17 April 2015|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-1-259-08476-8|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; This replace an older set of regulations from 1993.

==Summary==
All [[mutual fund]]s must register as [[Trust law|trust]]s under the [[Indian Trusts Act, 1882]]. The firm must set up a separate [[asset management company]] (AMC) to run mutual fund business. The net worth of the parent firm or AMC must be {{currency|50,000,000|INR}}. Mutual funds can be penalised for violating norms. Mutual funds dealing exclusively with the [[money market]] must register with the [[Reserve Bank of India]]. In 1995, private firms were allowed to enter the [[money market in India]] and deal with [[treasury bill]]s, [[commercial paper]]s, [[certificates of deposit]] etc. These are called Money Market Mutual Funds (MMMFs).&lt;ref name="Kothari2010"/&gt;

All other mutual funds must register with the SEBI. Now, there is a self-regulation agency for mutual funds, [[Association of Mutual Funds of India]] (AMFI).&lt;ref name="Kothari2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rajesh Kothari|title=Financial Services in India: Concept and Application|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yGxbcbQNLEC&amp;pg=PA184|accessdate=17 April 2015|date=10 November 2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-81-321-0507-7|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19561">{{Redirect|Poison pill}}

A '''shareholder rights plan''', colloquially known as a "'''poison pill'''", is a type of defensive tactic used by a [[corporation]]'s [[board of directors]] against a [[takeover]]. Typically, such a plan gives shareholders the right to buy more shares at a discount if one shareholder buys a certain percentage or more of the company's shares. The plan could be triggered, for instance, if any one shareholder buys 20% of the company's shares, at which point every shareholder (except the one who possesses 20%) will have the right to buy a new issue of shares at a discount. If every other shareholder is able to buy more shares at a discount, such purchases would dilute the bidder's interest, and the cost of the bid would rise substantially. Knowing that such a plan could be activated, the bidder could be disinclined to take over the corporation without the board's approval, and would first negotiate with the board in order to revoke the plan.&lt;ref&gt;For a description of a standard rights plan, see [[Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz]], ''The Share Purchase Rights Plan'' in Ronald J. Gilson &amp; Bernard S. Black, The Law and Finance of Corporate Acquisitions (2d ed. Supp. 1999) at 10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan can be issued by the board of directors as an "[[option (finance)|option]]" or a "[[warrant (finance)|warrant]]" attached to existing shares, and only be revoked at the discretion of the board.

In the field of [[mergers and acquisitions]], shareholder rights plans were devised in the early 1980s as a way to prevent takeover bidders from negotiating a price for sale of shares directly with shareholders, and instead forcing the bidder to negotiate with the board.

==History==
The poison pill was invented by [[mergers and acquisitions]] lawyer [[Martin Lipton]] of [[Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz]] in 1982, as a response to tender-based [[hostile takeovers]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Business School, Case Study 9-496-037, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; Poison pills became popular during the early 1980s in response to the wave of takeovers by [[corporate raid]]ers such as [[Carl Icahn]]. The term "poison pill" derives its original meaning from a [[suicide pill|poison pill]] physically carried by various [[Espionage|spies]] throughout history, a pill which was taken by the spies when they were discovered to eliminate the possibility of being interrogated by an enemy.

It was reported in 2001 that since 1997, for every company with a poison pill which successfully resisted a hostile takeover, there were 20 companies with poison pills that accepted takeover offers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3001307/2/c_3046510?f=insidecfo Poison Pill Popping - CFO Magazine - October 2001 Issue - CFO.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The trend since the early 2000s has been for shareholders to vote against poison pill authorization, since poison pills are designed to resist takeovers, whereas from the point of view of a shareholder, takeovers can be financially rewarding.

Some have argued that poison pills are detrimental to shareholder interests because they perpetuate existing management. For instance, [[Microsoft]] originally made an unsolicited bid for [[Yahoo!]], but subsequently dropped the bid after Yahoo! CEO [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Yang]] threatened to make the takeover as difficult as possible unless Microsoft raised the price to US$37 per share. One Microsoft executive commented, "They are going to burn the furniture if we go hostile. They are going to destroy the place." Yahoo has had a shareholders rights plan in place since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo weighs up options|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6445d618-d293-11dc-8636-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1|publisher=''[[Financial Times]]''|accessdate=2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts suggested that Microsoft's raised offer of $33 per share was already too expensive, and that Yang was not bargaining in good faith, which later led to several shareholder lawsuits and an aborted proxy fight from [[Carl Icahn]].&lt;ref name="msft_withdrawl1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Withdraws Proposal to Acquire Yahoo!|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/may08/05-03letter.mspx|publisher=''[[Microsoft]]''|accessdate=2008-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Microsoft's Failed Yahoo Bid Risks Online Growth|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/05/technology/05soft.html?_r=4&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|accessdate=2008-05-06 | first=Steve | last=Lohr | date=2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yahoo's stock price plunged after Microsoft withdrew the bid, and Jerry Yang faced a backlash from stockholders that eventually led to his resignation.

==Overview==
In publicly held companies, "poison pills" refer to various methods to deter [[takeover]] bids.  Takeover bids are attempts by a bidder to obtain control of a target company, either by [[proxy fight|soliciting proxies]] to get elected to the board or by acquiring a controlling block of shares and using the associated votes to get elected to the board.  Once in control of the board, the bidder can manage the target. As discussed below, targets have various takeover defenses available, and several types of defense have been called "poison pills" because they harm not only the bidder, but the target (or its shareholders) as well. Currently, the most common type of takeover defense is a shareholder rights plan.

Because the [[board of directors]] of the company can redeem or otherwise eliminate a standard poison pill, it does not typically preclude a [[proxy fight]] or other takeover attempts not accompanied by an acquisition of a significant block of the company's stock.  It can, however, prevent shareholders from entering into certain agreements that can assist in a proxy fight, such as an agreement to pay another shareholder's expenses.  In combination with a [[staggered board of directors]], however, a shareholder rights plan can be a defense.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |last=Bebchuk |first=Lucian |authorlink=Lucian Bebchuk |author2=Coates, John C. |author3=Subramanian, Guhan  |year=2002 |title=The Powerful Antitakeover Force of Staggered Boards: Theory, Evidence, and Policy |journal=[[Stanford Law Review]] |volume=54 |issue=5 |pages=887–951  |jstor= 1229689|doi=10.2307/1229689 |publisher=Stanford Law Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of a shareholder rights plan is to force a bidder to negotiate with the target's board and not directly with the shareholders. The effects are twofold:&lt;ref&gt;Fundamentals of Corporate Finance (6th ed.), Editions McGraw-Hill Ryerson, §23: Mergers and Acquisitions&lt;/ref&gt;

* It gives management time to find competing offers that maximize selling price.
* Several studies indicate that companies with poison pills (shareholder rights plans) have received higher takeover premiums than companies without poison pills. This results in increased shareholder value. The theory is that an increase in the negotiating power of the target is reflected in higher acquisition premiums.

===Common types of poison pills===
==== Preferred stock plan ====
The target issues a large number of new shares, often [[preferred stock|preferred shares]], to existing shareholders. These new shares usually have severe redemption provisions, such as allowing them to be converted into a large number of common shares if a takeover occurs. This immediately dilutes the percentage of the target owned by the acquirer, and makes it more expensive to acquire 50% of the target's stock.

==== Flip-in ====
A “flip-in” permits shareholders, except for the acquirer, to purchase additional shares at a discount. This provides investors with instantaneous profits. Using this type of poison pill also dilutes shares held by the acquiring company, making the takeover attempt more expensive and more difficult.

==== Flip-over ====
A “flip-over” enables stockholders to purchase the acquirer’s shares after the merger at a discounted rate. For example, a shareholder may gain the right to buy the stock of its acquirer, in subsequent mergers, at a two-for-one rate.

==== Back-end rights plan ====
Under this scenario, the target company re-phases all its employees' stock-option grants to ensure they immediately become vested if the company is taken over. Many employees can then exercise their options and then dump the stocks. With the release of the "golden handcuffs", many discontented employees may quit immediately after having cashed in their stock options. This poison pill is designed to create an exodus of talented employees, reducing a corporate value as a target. In many high-tech businesses, attrition of talented human resources may result in a diluted or empty shell being left behind for the new owner.

For instance, [[PeopleSoft]] guaranteed its customers in June 2003 that if it were acquired within two years, presumably by its rival Oracle, and product support were reduced within four years, its customers would receive a refund of between two and five times the fees they had paid for their PeopleSoft software licenses. While the acquisition ultimately prevailed, the hypothetical cost to Oracle was valued at as much as US$1.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;The Register, "Oracle chokes on PeopleSoft's poison pill", https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/11/11/oracle_chokes_on_peoplesofts_poison/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Voting plan ====
In a [[voting plan]], a company will charter preferred stock with superior voting rights over that of common shareholders. If an unfriendly bidder acquired a substantial quantity of the target firm's voting common stock, it then still would not be able to exercise control over its purchase. For example, [[ASARCO]] established a voting plan in which 99% of the company's common stock would only harness 16.5% of the total voting power.&lt;ref&gt;Paul H. Malatesta (University of Washington) and Ralph A. Walking (Ohio State University), "Poison Pill Securities: Stockholder Wealth, Profitability, and Ownership Structure," Journal of Financial Economics, Vol. 20, January/March 1988, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these pills, a "dead-hand" provision allows only the directors who introduce the poison pill to remove it (for a set period after they have been replaced), thus potentially delaying a new board’s decision to sell a company.

===Constraints and legal status===
The legality of poison pills had been unclear when they were first put to use in the early 1980s. However, the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] upheld poison pills as a valid instrument of takeover defense in its 1985 decision in [[Moran v. Household International, Inc.]]  However, many jurisdictions other than the U.S. have held the poison pill strategy as illegal, or place restraints on their use.

In Canada, almost all shareholders rights plans are "chewable," meaning they contain a permitted bid concept such that a bidder who is willing to conform to the requirements of a permitted bid can acquire the company by take-over bid without triggering a flip-in event.  Shareholder rights plans in Canada are also weakened by the ability of a hostile acquirer to petition the provincial securities regulators to have the company's pill overturned.  Generally, the courts will overturn the pill to allow shareholders to decide whether they want to tender to a bid for the company.  However, the company may be allowed to maintain it for long enough to run an auction to see if a [[white knight (business)|white knight]] can be found. A notable Canadian case before the securities regulators in 2006 involved the poison pill of [[Falconbridge Ltd.]] which at the time was the subject of a friendly bid from [[Vale Inco|Inco]] and a hostile bid from [[Xstrata]] plc, which was a 20% shareholder of Falconbridge.  Xstrata applied to have Falconbridge's pill invalidated, citing among other things that the Falconbridge had had its pill in place without shareholder approval for more than nine months and that the pill stood in the way of Falconbridge shareholders accepting Xstrata's all-cash offer for Falconbridge shares. Despite similar facts with previous cases in which securities regulators had promptly taken down pills, the [[Ontario Securities Commission]] ruled that Falconbridge's pill could remain in place for a further limited period as it had the effect of sustaining the auction for Falconbridge by preventing Xstrata increasing its ownership and potentially obtaining a blocking position that would prevent other bidders from obtaining 100% of the shares.

In the United Kingdom, poison pills are not allowed under the [[Takeover Panel]] rules. The rights of public shareholders are protected by the Panel on a case-by-case, principles-based regulatory regime. One disadvantage of the Panel's prohibition of poison pills is that it allows bidding wars to be won by hostile bidders who buy shares of their target in the marketplace during "raids". Raids have helped bidders win targets such as [[BAA Limited|BAA]] plc and [[AWG plc]] when other bidders were considering emerging at higher prices. If these companies had poison pills, they could have prevented the raids by threatening to dilute the positions of their hostile suitors if they exceeded the statutory levels (often 10% of the outstanding shares) in the rights plan. The [[London Stock Exchange]] itself is another example of a company that has seen significant stakebuilding by a hostile suitor, in this case the [[NASDAQ]]. The LSE's ultimate fate is currently up in the air, but NASDAQ's stake is sufficiently large that it is essentially impossible for a third party bidder to make a successful offer to acquire the LSE.

Takeover law is still evolving in continental Europe, as individual countries slowly fall in line with requirements mandated by the [[European Commission]]. Stakebuilding is commonplace in many continental takeover battles such as [[Scania AB]]. Formal poison pills are quite rare in continental Europe, but national governments hold [[golden shares]] in many "strategic" companies such as telecom monopolies and energy companies. Governments have also served as "poison pills" by threatening potential suitors with negative regulatory developments if they pursue the takeover. Examples of this include Spain's adoption of new rules for the ownership of energy companies after [[E.ON]] of Germany made a hostile bid for [[Endesa (Spain)|Endesa]] and France's threats to punish any potential acquiror of [[Groupe Danone]].

===Other takeover defenses===
Poison pill is sometimes used more broadly to describe other types of takeover defenses that involve the target taking some action.  Although the broad category of takeover defenses (more commonly known as "shark repellents") includes the traditional shareholder rights plan poison pill.  Other anti-takeover protections include:

*Limitations on the ability to call special meetings or take action by written consent.
*Supermajority vote requirements to approve mergers.
*Supermajority vote requirements to remove directors.
*The target adds to its charter a provision which gives the current shareholders the right to sell their shares to the acquirer at an increased price (usually 100% above recent average share price), if the acquirer's share of the company reaches a critical limit (usually one third). This kind of poison pill cannot stop a determined acquirer, but ensures a high price for the company.
* The target takes on large [[debt]]s in an effort to make the debt load too high to be attractive—the acquirer would eventually have to pay the debts.
* The company buys a number of smaller companies using a [[stock swap]], diluting the value of the target's stock.
* The target grants its employees [[stock options]] that immediately vest if the company is taken over.  This is intended to give employees an incentive to continue working for the target company at least until a merger is completed instead of looking for a new job as soon as takeover discussions begin.  However, with the release of the "[[golden handcuffs]]", many discontented employees may quit immediately after they've cashed in their stock options. This poison pill may create an exodus of talented employees.  In many high-tech businesses, attrition of talented [[human resources]] often means an [[Shell (corporation)|empty shell]] is left behind for the new owner.
* [[PeopleSoft]] guaranteed its customers in June 2003 that if it were acquired within two years, presumably by its rival [[Oracle Corporation]], and product support were reduced within four years, its customers would receive a refund of between two and five times the fees they had paid for their PeopleSoft software licenses.  The hypothetical cost to Oracle was valued at as much as US$1.5 billion. PeopleSoft allowed the guarantee to expire in April 2004. If PeopleSoft had not prepared itself by adopting effective takeover defenses, it is unclear if Oracle would have significantly raised its original bid of $16 per share. The increased bid provided an additional $4.1 billion for PeopleSoft's shareholders.
* Classified boards with staggered elections for the [[board of directors]]. For example, if a company had nine directors, then three directors would be up for re-election each year, with a three-year term. This would present a potential acquirer with the position of having a hostile board for at least a year after the first election. In some companies, certain percentages of the board (33%) may be enough to block key decisions (such as a full merger agreement or major asset sale), so an acquirer may not be able to close an acquisition for years after having purchased a majority of the target's stock. As of December 31, 2008, 47.05% of the companies in the S&amp;P Super 1500 had a classified board.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.SharkRepellent.net&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shareholder input===
An increasing number of companies are giving shareholders a say on poison pills. As of June 15, 2009, 21 companies that had adopted or extended a poison pill had publicly disclosed they plan to put the poison pill to a shareholder vote within a year. That was up from 2008's full year total of 18, and was the largest number ever reported since the early 1980s, when the pill was invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laide|first=John|title=Shareholder Input on Poison Pills|url=https://www.sharkrepellent.net/request?an=dt.getPage&amp;st=1&amp;pg=/pub/rs_20090615.html&amp;Shareholder_Input_on_Poison_Pills&amp;rnd=674362|publisher=SharkRepellent.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

In 1896, a group of eight advertising men in [[New York City]] began meeting for lunch on a regular basis to share ideas on the business that sustained them. They called themselves the Sphinx Club, and in 1906 the growing group incorporated as the Advertising Men's League, ultimately becoming The Advertising Club of New York in 1915.

Most of The Ad Club's early years were spent at the landmark [[Stanford White]] building at 23 Park Avenue, where Ad Club members, including the young [[Bill Paley]], [[J.C. Penney]], and [[Bill Bernbach]], conducted business in the main dining room over lunch.

== Initiatives ==

* 1906: First formal course in advertising to be offered by an educational institution at [[New York University]] (NYU).
* 1911: The first supporter of the "[[false advertising|truth in advertising]]" [[Program (management)|program]], which remains a hallmark of [[consumer protection]], and formed the first "[[Vigilance Committee]]", which evolved into today's [[Better Business Bureau]].
* 1923: Held the first-ever advertising [[trade fair|exposition]] at the 71st Regiment Armory to much acclaim, with an attendance of over 58,000.
* 1949: Founded the Advertising Hall of Fame immortalizing 10 giants of our industry the first year, and many more until it was turned over to the [[American Advertising Federation]] in 1973.
* 1964: Founded the [[International ANDY Awards]] to recognize creative excellence in advertising and to raise the standards of craftsmanship in industry.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite web|last=Vega|first=Tanzina|title=With Diversity Still Lacking, Industry Focuses on Retention|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/04/business/media/with-diversity-still-lacking-industry-focuses-on-retention.html?_r=0|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Viter Juste was born on the island of [[Gonâve Island|La Gonâve]], a Haitian island in the [[Gulf of Gonâve]], on December 15, 1924.&lt;ref name=mherald2/&gt; His father was a businessman.&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt; Viter Juste received a college degree in business and [[accounting]].&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt; In 1946, Juste opened his first business, a supermarket located in the Haitian capital, [[Port-au-Prince]].&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt; He later shuttered his supermarket in order to take a position with a [[disease eradication]] program operated by the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt;

===Move to the United States===
Juste's life in Haiti changed in the aftermath of the [[Haitian general election, 1957|1957 Haitian presidential election]], which was won by [[François "Papa Doc" Duvalier]].&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt; Duvalier would become a [[dictator]], responsible for the deaths of thousands and the flight of many professionals from the country. Juste, who had openly supported Duvalier's main opponent, [[Louis Déjoie]], in the election decided to leave Haiti for the United States for the safety of himself and his family.&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt; He initially moved to [[Texas]], before living in [[New York City]] for several years.&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt; In 1973, Juste, his wife, Maria, and their children moved to [[Miami, Florida]].&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt;

===Advocacy===
In 1972, one year before Juste moved to Miami, the first known, documented boat carrying Haitian [[refugee]]s landed in [[South Florida]].&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt; Two years later, Viter Juste held a 1974 meeting with [[Monsignor]] [[Bryan O. Walsh]] of the Roman Catholic Church in an effort to help the refugees.&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt; The 1974 collaboration between Walsh and Juste resulted in the creation of the Haitian-American Community Association of Dade, which was one of the first [[social service]] organizations founded specifically to cater to the needs of the Haitian community in Miami.&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt; Juste served as one of the Association's first directors.&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt; The meeting between Juste and Walsh effectively launched Juste's career as an advocate and activist on behalf of South Florida's Haitian immigrant and Haitian American community.&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt;

Juste led a community [[boycott]] against a local branch of the [[Winn-Dixie]] [[supermarket]], which had openly discriminated against [[Haitian people|Haitians]].&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt; He also protested against the [[Miami-Dade County Public Schools]] during the 1970s after the [[Miami-Dade School Board]] refused to allow undocumented Haitian students to enroll in the [[school district]].&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt; 

Juste's fight with the Miami-Dade School District led him to coin the term "[[Little Haiti]]" for the largely Haitian American neighborhood of Miami, historically known as Lemon City.&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt; According to Jean-Claude Exulien, a retired professor of history and friend of Juste's since 1977, Juste authored an article in the ''Miami Herald'' in which he first referred to the neighborhood as "Little Port-au-Prince."&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt; However, editors at the ''Miami Herald'' found the name, "Little Port-au-Prince," too long, so the newspaper shortened the term in the headline to "Little Haiti."&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt; The name stuck and has been widely used for the neighborhood.

Juste also worked to advance the Haitian American community in business and media. Juste was the first person in Miami to establish a [[French-language]] [[weekly newspaper]] targeted to Haitian Americans. His newspaper, which consisted of twelve pages, cost readers just [[Quarter (United States coin)|25 cents]].&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt; Juste also opened Les Cousins Records and Books, which was the first store in Miami to sell [[Haitian Creole]] and Frans-language music and books.&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt; Juste moved Les Cousins Records and Books to Little Haiti.

Juste is also considered a pioneer in adult education in Miami. He was the first person to establish an adult education program held in the evenings,&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt; which allowed working people to attend his classes. Juste taught both [[English language]] classes and skills to assimilate into larger American society.&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt;

===Later life===
Juste, who suffered from [[diabetes]] and [[dementia]] during his later life, died at on assisted living facility in [[North Miami, Florida]], on November 19, 2012, at the age of 87.&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt; He was survived by Juste by two daughters, Chantal Juste Watson and Maria Blain; three sons, [[Carl Juste]], a [[photojournalist]] for the ''[[Miami Herald]]'', Wagner, and Patrick Juste; fifteen grandchildren; and fifteen great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt; Juste was predeceased by his wife of sixty years, Maria, died in 2008, and two sons.&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt;

Archbishop [[Thomas Wenski]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami]], who had known Viter Juste since in 1979, said of him following his death, "He was a man passionate for making his mark in the Haitian community; both as a businessman and a community leader...He was a pioneer, and paved the way for young generations of Haitians to follow."&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt; Former Haitian [[political prisoner]] and history professor, [[Jean-Claude Exulien]], who first Juste in 1977, also paid tribute to Juste, telling the ''Miami Herald'', "This is a huge loss for the community...We didn’t always agree on Haiti, but on the plan for the community here, we were together."&lt;ref name=mherald/&gt;

He graduated from the Technical High School in [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Croatia]] in 1978. In 1981 he got his first job in the Split construction company ''Melioracija'' spending a year in [[Iraq]] working on military bases.

==Business career==
He founded the company ''Kerum'' in 1989, opening his first [[convenience store]] in 1990. Six years later he opened his first [[supermarket]] in the [[Lora (Split)|Lora]] neighborhood of Split. In 2003 he bought the ''Diokom'' industrial facilities (ex-''Jugoplastika'') and in 2007 he opened the ''Joker'' Shopping Mall, the largest in [[Dalmatia]] at the time.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zeljkokerumsplit.com/biografija-zeljka-keruma/ |title=Biografija Željka Keruma |work=Zeljkokerumsplit.com |language=Croatian |accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
In the first round of the 2009 elections for mayor of Split, Kerum (independent) won 40.21% of the popular vote, while his closest rival [[Ranko Ostojić]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|SDP]]) won 34.72%.&lt;ref name=izbori&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.izbori.hr/2009Lokalni/rezultati/rezultati.html |title=Rezultati lokalnih izbora 2009 |date=2009-05-18 |accessdate=2009-05-18 |language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 31, he won 58.42% of the vote, making him the incumbent mayor of Split.&lt;ref name=JL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jutarnji.hr/vijesti/izbori2009/detalji/art-2009,5,31,,165294.jl |title=Kerum: Zaposlit ću sve i riješiti stambene probleme |work=Jutarnji.hr |language=Croatian |accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009 during a live television interview on the ''[[Nedjeljom u 2]]'' talk show that airs on the Croatian state broadcaster [[HRT 1]], in response to host [[Aleksandar Stanković (journalist)|Aleksandar Stanković]]'s question if Serb businessmen are welcome in Croatia, Kerum answered: "If it was up to me I wouldn't let them because [[Serbs]] never brought us anything good in the past and they won't do it now. Not only Serbs, but also [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]]. And whoever is doing business with them will not make out OK". Asked further by Stanković if he would accept a man of Serb ethnicity as a son-in-law, Kerum answered emphatically: "No, never".

On January 16, 2011 the citizens of [[Split, Croatia|Split]], on the initiative of an informal group of citizens gathered on [[Facebook]], protested at the Prva voda beach on the park mountain [[Marjan, Split|Marjan]] in Split against a change of city urban planning regulation that allowed construction of restaurants and bars in the beach area. According to plans, on the proposed beach site a company owned by his mistress Fani Horvat planned to build such an object, with the destruction of protected wood area. The idea was perceived as a nepotistic venture and favouring of Kerum's own interests instead of the city's.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Split/tabid/72/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/126890/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Kerum also caused a stir in Split when he proposed to build a 40 meter tall statue of Christ the Redeemer to rival that of Brazil.

In 2011, he became a candidate in the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2011]] on the electoral list of the [[Croatian Democratic Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.poslovni.hr/vijesti/hdz-predao-izborne-liste-kosor-prva-u-petoj-jedinici-190541.aspx | language = Croatian | title = HDZ predao izborne liste, Kosor prva u petoj jedinici | newspaper = [[Poslovni dnevnik]] | date = 2011-11-14 | accessdate = 2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Croatian local elections, 2013]] Kerum won only 18.57% of the popular vote while re-running for mayor, which did not qualify him to the second round of the elections. Also, Kerum's [[Croatian Civic Party]] won only 12.41% of the popular votes for the city council of Split.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/bandic-pobjednik-kerum-porazen-milanovic-ponizen/678557.aspx | title = Bandić pobjednik, Kerum poražen, Milanović ponižen | language = Croatian | date = 20 May 2013 | accessdate = 4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2015]], his Croatian civic party won only 2234 votes in the two Dalmatian constituencies and became a non-parliamentary party.

==Personal life==

In 1989 Kerum married Anka Lalin, with whom he has a daughter and son. In 2009, he surprised the public by publicly announcing he was divorcing his wife to be with his pregnant mistress Fani Horvat, who was nearly 25 years his junior. The news caused many in the media to point out the hypocrisy in his political image, where he has consistently presented himself as a supporter of traditional values and a conservative world view, but had been participating in an extramarital affair.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.net.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/page/2009/10/19/0640006.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerum has been known to own expensive cars including a [[Hummer]], a [[Mercedes S500]], a [[BMW 7]], a [[Maybach 62]], a [[Ferrari F430]], and a [[Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano]].&lt;ref name="24 sata"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.24sata.hr/news/prijatelju-posudis-ti-meni-malo-taj-svoj-novi-ferrari/155866/ | title=Prijatelju, posudiš ti meni malo taj svoj novi Ferrari? | work=[[24 sata (Croatia)|24 sata]] | date=January 26, 2010 | language=Croatian | accessdate=2010-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20030826/automoto01.asp | title=Maybach u Splitu! | work=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]] | date=August 26, 2003 | language=Croatian | accessdate=2010-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/kerum-vozi-ferrari-kupljen-na-braniteljsku-povlasticu/427020.aspx | title=Kerum vozi Ferrari kupljen na braniteljsku povlasticu? | work=[[Index.hr]] | date=March 25, 2009 | language=Croatian | accessdate=2010-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Cessna Citation X]], a [[business jet]] worth approximately US$17 million, is the most expensive privately owned aircraft in Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/kerumova-cessna-najskuplji-hrvatski-privatni-zrakoplov/841530/ | title=Kerumova Cessna najskuplji hrvatski privatni zrakoplov | date=June 24, 2010 | work=[[Jutarnji list]] | language=Croatian | accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
