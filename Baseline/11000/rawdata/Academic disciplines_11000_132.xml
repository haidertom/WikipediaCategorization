'''''Kitāb al–Milal wa al-Nihal''''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]:كتاب الملل والنحل, ''The Book of Sects and Creeds''), written by the [[Islamic scholar]] [[Muhammad al-Shahrastani]] (d. 1153 [[Common Era|CE]]), is a non-polemical study of religious communities and philosophies that had existed up to his time, considered to be the first systematic [[religious studies|study of religion]]. It was written around 1127-1128 and divides religions between sects, which have written doctrines, and creeds which do not.

A French translation of the book by Gimaret, Monnot and Jolivet was sponsored by [[UNESCO]] (''Livre des religions et des sects.'' Leuven, Peeters: vol. I, 1986, Vol. II, 1993).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="805">In [[structural engineering]] the '''amplification factor''' is the ratio of second order to first order [[deflection (engineering)|deflections]].

The amplification factor, also called [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], is the extent to which an analog amplifier boosts the strength of a signal.

In calculations this is represented by the symbol A&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;

In [[numerical analysis]] the '''amplification factor''' is a number derived using [[Von Neumann stability analysis]] to determine stability of a numerical scheme for a [[partial differential equation]].

The '''Animal Demography Unit (ADU)''' is a formally recognized research unit of the '''[[University of Cape Town]]''' (UCT) located within the Department of Biological Sciences of UCT. (The Department of Biological Sciences was formed from the merger of the Department of Botany and the Department of Zoology at the start of the 2013 academic year). The Animal Demography Unit, popularly known as the ADU, was responsible for the management of the First and Second Southern African Bird Atlas Projects '''[[Southern African Bird Atlas Project|SABAP1]]''' and '''[[SABAP2]]'''. The unit has submitted over eight million georeferenced biodiversity records to [[GBIF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Publisher - Animal Demography Unit, Department of Zoology, University of Cape Town|url=https://www.gbif.org/publisher/dd862d06-e6e9-4ab9-bc86-c875cc148c1f|website=www.gbif.org|publisher=Global Biodiversity Information Facility|accessdate=6 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Animal Demography Unit (formerly the Avian Demography Unit), or ADU as it is mostly known in the vernacular, is a research unit of the University of Cape Town. Initially it was built on the nucleus of the South African Bird Ringing Unit ([[SAFRING]]) and the Southern African Bird Atlas Project ([[SABAP]]). The ADU was established in December 1991 within the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Cape Town. Over the years, the ADU has grown far beyond its starting point.

The concept on which the ADU is based can be traced back to 1983, when a workshop was held in Johannesburg on the establishment of a Bird Populations Data Bank for South Africa. This workshop was held in conjunction with a "Birds and Man" symposium which had been organised by the Southern African Ornithological Society (now BirdLife South Africa).

The ADU has continued to be closely associated with [[BirdLife South Africa]]. and has a formal partnership relationship with that organization, with the objective of fostering the development of further ornithological projects. This close association is appropriate because much of the research of the ADU continues to focus on large scale demographic studies in which participation by amateurs is a vital element.

Over the past years, the ADU has expanded the range of projects for which it is responsible. This website provides information on them, and the people who undertake them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =About the ADU| url =http://adu.org.za/about.php| website =| date= | accessdate =16 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Annual plant|'''Annuality''']] (living and reproducing in a single year) and [[Perennial plant|'''perenniality''']] (living more than two years) represent major life history strategies within plant lineages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Allison J.|last2=Gross|first2=Briana L.|date=2011-09-01|title=From forest to field: Perennial fruit crop domestication|url=http://www.amjbot.org/content/98/9/1389|journal=American Journal of Botany|language=en|volume=98|issue=9|pages=1389–1414|doi=10.3732/ajb.1000522|issn=0002-9122|pmid=21865506}}&lt;/ref&gt; These traits can shift from one to another over both macroevolutionary and microevolutionary timescales.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Gordon A.|date=1990-06-01|title=Perennation and the Persistence of Annual Life Histories|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/285076|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=135|issue=6|pages=829–840|doi=10.1086/285076|issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt; While perenniality and annuality are often described as discrete either-or traits, they often occur in a continuous spectrum.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; The complex history of switches between annual and perennial habit involve both natural and artificial causes, and studies of this fluctuation have importance to [[sustainable agriculture]]. (Note that perennial here refers to both woody and herbaceous perennial species.)

According to some studies, either the trait of annuality or perenniality may be ancestral.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tank|first=David C.|last2=Olmstead|first2=Richard G.|date=2008-05-01|title=From annuals to perennials: phylogeny of subtribe Castillejinae (Orobanchaceae)|url=http://www.amjbot.org/content/95/5/608|journal=American Journal of Botany|language=en|volume=95|issue=5|pages=608–625|doi=10.3732/ajb.2007346|issn=0002-9122|pmid=21632387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This contradicts the commonly held belief that annuality is a derived trait from an ancestral perennial life form, as is suggested by a regarded plant population biology text.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

== Spatiotemporal scale ==
Above the species level, plant lineages clearly vary in their tendency for annuality or perenniality (e.g., wheat vs. oaks). On a microevolutionary timescale, a single plant [[species]] may show different annual or perennial [[ecotype]]s (e.g., adapted to dry or tropical range), as in the case of the wild progenitor of rice (''[[Oryza rufipogon]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barbier|first=P.|last2=Morishima|first2=H.|last3=Ishihama|first3=A.|date=1991-05-01|title=Phylogenetic relationships of annual and perennial wild rice: probing by direct DNA sequencing|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00226739|journal=Theoretical and Applied Genetics|language=en|volume=81|issue=5|pages=693–702|doi=10.1007/BF00226739|issn=0040-5752}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-5794-0_3|title=Origin, dispersal, cultivation and variation of rice|last=Khush|first=Gurdev S.|date=1997-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789401064460|editor-last=Sasaki|editor-first=Takuji|pages=25–34|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-5794-0_3|editor-last2=Moore|editor-first2=Graham}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, ability to [[Perennation|perennate]] (live more than one year) may vary within a single population of a species.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to plant population biology|last2=Silvertown|first2=Deborah|date=2001|publisher=Blackwell Science|isbn=978-0-632-04991-2|edition=4th|location=Oxford [u.a.]|page=165|last1=Charlesworth|first1=Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underlying mechanisms: Trade-offs ==
Annuality and perenniality are [[complex traits]] involving many underlying, often quantitative, genotypic and phenotypic factors.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lammer|first=Doug|last2=Cai|first2=Xiwen|last3=Arterburn|first3=Matthew|last4=Chatelain|first4=Jeron|last5=Murray|first5=Timothy|last6=Jones|first6=Stephen|date=2004-08-01|title=A single chromosome addition from Thinopyrum elongatum confers a polycarpic, perennial habit to annual wheat|url=http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/403/1715|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|language=en|volume=55|issue=403|pages=1715–1720|doi=10.1093/jxb/erh209|issn=0022-0957|pmid=15234999}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often determined by a trade-off between allocation to sexual (flower) structures and asexual (vegetative) structures.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Jannice|last2=Rubin|first2=Matthew J.|date=2015-04-01|title=All in good time: Understanding annual and perennial strategies in plants|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3732/ajb.1500062|journal=American Journal of Botany|language=en|volume=102|issue=4|pages=497–499|doi=10.3732/ajb.1500062|issn=0002-9122|pmid=25878083}}&lt;/ref&gt; Switches between the annual and perennial habit are known to be common among herbaceous angiosperms.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;

Increased allocation to reproduction early in life generally leads to a decrease in survival later in life ([[senescence]]); this occurs in both annual and perennial semelparous plants.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Exceptions to this pattern include long-lived [[Clone (plant)|clonal]] (see ramets section below) and long-lived non-clonal perennial species (e.g., [[bristlecone pine]]).&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

== Associated traits ==
[[File:Inbreeding- Selfing.jpg|thumb]]Many traits involving mating patterns (e.g., outcrossing or selfing) and life history strategies (e.g., annual or perennial) are inherently linked.

=== Typical annual-associated traits ===

==== Self-fertilization ====
[[Self-fertilization]] (selfing, or autogamy) is more common in annual compared to perennial herbs.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Since annuals typically have only one opportunity for reproduction, selfing provides a reliable source of fertilization.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; However, switches to selfing in annuals may result in an "[[Evolutionary dead-end|evolutionary dead end]]," in the sense that it is probably unlikely to return to an outcrossing (allogamous) state.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Selfing and inbreeding can also result in the accumulation of [[Deleterious mutation|deleterious alleles]], resulting in [[inbreeding depression]].&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

==== Semelparity ====
[[File:Modèle d’optimisation consistant à maximiser les bénéfices.png|thumb|Semelparous vs. iteroparous reproductive strategies.]]
All annual plants are considered [[Semelparity and iteroparity|semelparous]] (a.k.a., monocarpy or big-bang reproduction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hautekèete|first=N.-C.|last2=Piquot|first2=Y.|last3=Van Dijk|first3=H.|date=2001-09-15|title=Investment in survival and reproduction along a semelparity–iteroparity gradient in the Beta species complex|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1420-9101.2001.00322.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology|language=en|volume=14|issue=5|pages=795–804|doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2001.00322.x|issn=1420-9101}}&lt;/ref&gt;), i.e., they reproduce once before death.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/semelparity-and-iteroparity-13260334|title=Semelparity and Iteroparity {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable|website=www.nature.com|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted (see "Anomalies" section) that even semelparity exerts some plasticity in terms of seed-production timing over the year. That is, it is uncommon for all offspring to be generated at exactly the same time, which would be considered the extreme end of semelparity.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=P|last2=Simons|first2=Andrew M|date=2014-04-26|title=The continuum between semelparity and iteroparity: plastic expression of parity in response to season length manipulation in Lobelia inflata|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/14/90|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|language=En|volume=14|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-14-90|pmc=4005853|pmid=24766909|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead offspring are usually generated in discrete packages (as a sort of micro-iteroparous strategy), and the temporal spacing of these reproductive events varies by organism.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; This is attributed to phenotypic plasticity.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

[[Biennial plant]]s (living two years and reproducing in the second) are also considered semelparous.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~dstratto/bcor102/readings/Lobelias.pdf|title=Case Studies in Evolutionary Ecology: Why do some species reproduce only once?|last=Stratton|first=Donald A.|date=|website=Plant Biology at the University of Vermont|publisher=University of Vermont|access-date=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Seed bank ====
Although annuals have no vegetative regrowth from year to year, many retain a dormant population back-up underground in the form of a seed bank.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; The seed bank serves as an annual's source of [[Population pyramid|age structure]] in the sense that often not all seeds will germinate each year.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Thus, each year's population will consist of individuals of different ages in terms of seed dormancy times. The seed bank also helps to ensure the annual's survival and genetic integrity in variable or disturbed habitats (e.g., a desert), where good growing conditions are not guaranteed every year.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Not all annuals, however, retain a seed bank.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; As far as population density, annuals with seed banks are predicted to be more temporally variable yet more spatially constant over time, while plants with no seed bank would be expected to be patchy (spatially variable).&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

=== Typical perennial-associated traits ===

==== Cross-fertilization ====
Certain non-selfing reproductive adaptations, such as [[Dioecy (plant)|dioecy]] (obligate [[outcrossing]] via separate male and female individuals), may have arisen in long lived herbaceous and woody species due to negative side effects of selfing in these species, notably [[genetic load]] and [[inbreeding depression]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Among angiosperms, dioecy is known to be substantially more common than pure [[Self-incompatibility in plants|self-incompatibility]].&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Dioecy is also more typical of trees and shrubs compared to annual species.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

==== Iteroparity ====
Most perennials are [[Semelparity and iteroparity|iteroparous]] (or polycarpic), which means they reproduce multiple times during their lifespan.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;
[[File:Rice rhizome.JPG|thumb|Rice rhizomes.]]

==== Persistence of ramets ====
[[Clonal colony|Ramets]] are vegetative, clonal extensions of a central [[Clonal colony|genet]]. Common examples are [[rhizome]]s (modified stem), tillers, and [[stolon]]s. A plant is perennial if the birth rate of ramets exceeds their death rate.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Several of the oldest known plants are clonal. Some genets have been reported to be many thousands of years old, and a steady rate of branching likely aids in avoiding senescence.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inghe|first=Ola|last2=Tamm|first2=Carl Olof|date=1985-01-01|title=Survival and Flowering of Perennial Herbs.

==== Polyploidy ====
There is a possible connection between [[polyploid]]y (having more than two copies of one's chromosomes) and perenniality.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; One potential explanation is that both polyploids (larger in size) and asexual reproduction (common in perennials) tend to be selected for in inhospitable extremes of a species' distribution.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; One example could be the intricate polyploidy of native Australian perennial ''[[Glycine (plant)|Glycine]]'' species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doyle|first=J.

==== Niche Conservatism ====
Woody species have been found to occupy fewer climatic niches than herbaceous species, which was suggested to be a result of their slower generation time; such differences in adaptation may result in [[niche conservatism]] among perennial species, in the sense that their climatic niche has not changed much over evolutionary time.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Stephen A.|last2=Beaulieu|first2=Jeremy M.|date=2009-12-22|title=Life history influences rates of climatic niche evolution in flowering plants|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1677/4345|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=276|issue=1677|pages=4345–4352|doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.1176|issn=0962-8452|pmc=2817099|pmid=19776076}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diniz-Filho|first=José Alexandre Felizola|last2=Terribile|first2=Levi Carina|last3=da Cruz|first3=Mary Joice Ribeiro|last4=Vieira|first4=Ludgero Cardoso G.|date=2010-11-01|title=Hidden patterns of phylogenetic non-stationarity overwhelm comparative analyses of niche conservatism and divergence|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00562.x/abstract|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography|language=en|volume=19|issue=6|pages=916–926|doi=10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00562.x|issn=1466-8238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anomalies ==

=== Semelparity and iteroparity ===
[[Semelparity and iteroparity|Semelparity]] in perennials is rare but occurs in several types of plants, likely due to adaptive changes for greater seed allocation in response to seed predation (although other drivers, such as biased [[pollination]], have been proposed).&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;
[[File:Closeup of Century Plant (Agave) (5009844768).jpg|thumb|250x250px|Century plant (''[[Agave deserti]]'') inflorescence; a semelparous perennial.]]
'''List of semelparous perennials:'''&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;
* [[Carrot]] (''[[Daucus carota]]'' subsp. ''sativus'')
* ''[[Agave]]''
** ''[[Agave deserti]]'' (century plant)
* ''[[Hesperoyucca whipplei]]''
* semelparous bamboo

* ''[[Corypha umbraculifera]]'' (Talipot palm)
* ''[[Lobelia telekii]]''
* ''[[Senecio jacobaea]]'' (ragwort)
* ''[[Cynoglossum officinale]]''

=== Mating system ===
The [[Polemoniaceae]] (phlox) family shows considerable flexibility in both life history and mating system, showing combinations of annual / selfing, annual / outcrossing, perennial / selfing, and perennial / outcrossing lineages. These switches indicate a more ecologically determined, rather than a phylogenetically fixed, change in habit.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Environmental drivers ==
High environmental stochasticity, i.e., random fluctuations in climate or disturbance regime, can be buffered by both the annual and perennial habit.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; However, the annual habit is more closely associated with a stochastic environment, whether that is naturally or artificially induced.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Population biology of plants|last=Harper|first=John L.|publisher=Academic Press|year=1977|isbn=978-1932846249|location=London, England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to higher seedling compared to adult survival in such stochastic environments; common examples are arid environments such as deserts as well as frequently disturbed habitats (e.g., cropland).&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Iteroparous perennial species are more likely to persist in habitats where adult survival is favored over seedling survival (e.g., canopied, moist).&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; This adult/juvenile trade-off can be described succinctly in the following equations: &lt;blockquote&gt;λ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = c''m''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;λ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = c''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; ''+'' ''p''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''m''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; (or &lt;) ''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + (''p''/''c'')&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;(Silvertown &amp; Charlesworth, 2001, p. 296)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Where: λ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = rate of growth of annual population. λ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = rate of growth of perennial population. c = survival to reproductive age (flowering). ''m''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = seeds produced for each annual individual (average). ''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = seeds produced for each perennial individual. ''p'' = adult survival.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

If ''m''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + (''p''/''c''), the annual habit has greater [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. If ''m''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + (''p''/''c''), the perennial habit has greater fitness.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Thus a great deal of the fitness balance depends on the reproductive allocation to seeds, which is why annuals are known for greater reproductive effort than perennials.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamont C. Cole. "The Population Consequences of Life History Phenomena." ''The Quarterly Review of Biology'' 29, no. 2 (June 1954): 103-137&lt;/ref&gt;

Different climate and disturbance patterns may also cause [[Demography|demographic]] changes in populations.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Groenendael|first=J.

== Evolution rate ==
The annual vs. perennial trait has been [[Empirical research|empirically]] associated with differing subsequent rates of [[molecular evolution]] within multiple plant lineages.

== Artificial selection ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19354">{{About|the computer programming concept|assertions in the context of the [[Security Assertion Markup Language]] (SAML) open standard|Security Assertion Markup Language#Assertions}} 

In [[computer programming]], an '''assertion''' is a [[Statement (computer science)|statement]] that a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] ([[Boolean-valued function]], i.e. a true–false [[Expression (computer science)|expression]]) is always true at that point in code execution.  It can help a programmer read the code, help a compiler compile it, or help the program detect its own defects.

For the latter, some programs check assertions by actually evaluating the predicate as they run and if it is not in fact true, an assertion failure, the program considers itself to be broken and typically deliberately [[Crash (computing)|crashes]] or throws an assertion failure [[exception handling|exception]].

== Details ==

The following code contains two assertions, &lt;code&gt;x &gt; 0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x &gt; 1&lt;/code&gt;, and they are indeed true at the indicated points during execution:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
x = 1;
assert x &gt; 0;
x++;
assert x &gt; 1;
&lt;/source&gt;

Programmers can use assertions to help specify programs and to reason about program correctness. For example, a [[precondition]]—an assertion placed at the beginning of a section of code—determines the set of states under which the programmer expects the code to execute. A [[postcondition]]—placed at the end—describes the expected state at the end of execution. For example: &lt;code&gt;x &gt; 0 { x++ } x &gt; 1&lt;/code&gt;.

The example above uses the notation for including assertions used by [[C. A. R. Hoare]] in his 1969 article.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. A. R. Hoare]], [http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1912 An axiomatic basis for computer programming], ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'', 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; That notation cannot be used in existing mainstream programming languages. However, programmers can include unchecked assertions using the [[Comment (computer programming)|comment feature]] of their programming language. For example, in [[C (programming language)|C]]:

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
x = 5;
x = x + 1;
// {x &gt; 1}
&lt;/source&gt;

The braces included in the comment help distinguish this use of a comment from other uses.

Libraries may provide assertion features as well. For example, in C using glibc with C99 support:

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
#include &lt;assert.h&gt;

int f(void)
{
    int x = 5;
    x = x + 1;
    assert(x &gt; 1);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Several modern programming languages include checked assertions – [[statement (programming)|statements]] that are checked at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|runtime]] or sometimes statically. If an assertion evaluates to false at runtime, an assertion failure results, which typically causes execution to abort.  This draws attention to the location at which the logical inconsistency is detected and can be preferable to the behaviour that would otherwise result.

The use of assertions helps the programmer design, develop, and reason about a program.

== Usage ==

In languages such as [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], assertions form part of the design process; other languages, such as [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], use them only to check assumptions at runtime. In both cases, they can be checked for validity at runtime but can usually also be suppressed.

=== Assertions in design by contract ===

Assertions can function as a form of documentation: they can describe the state the code expects to find before it runs (its [[precondition]]s), and the state the code expects to result in when it is finished running ([[postcondition]]s); they can also specify [[invariant (computer science)|invariants]] of a [[Class (computer science)|class]]. [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] integrates such assertions into the language and automatically extracts them to document the class. This forms an important part of the method of [[design by contract]].

This approach is also useful in languages that do not explicitly support it: the advantage of using assertion statements rather than assertions in [[comment (computer programming)|comments]] is that the program can check the assertions every time it runs; if the assertion no longer holds, an error can be reported. This prevents the code from getting out of sync with the assertions.

=== Assertions for run-time checking ===

An assertion may be used to verify that an assumption made by the programmer during the implementation of the program remains valid when the program is executed. For example, consider the following [[Java (programming language)|Java]] code:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
 int total = countNumberOfUsers();
 if (total % 2 == 0) {
     // total is even
 } else {
     // total is odd and non-negative
     assert total % 2 == 1;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

In [[Java (programming language)|Java]], &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; is the ''[[remainder]]'' operator (''[[Modulo operation|modulo]]''), and in Java, if its first operand is negative, the result can also be negative (unlike the modulo used in mathematics). Here, the programmer has assumed that &lt;code&gt;total&lt;/code&gt; is non-negative, so that the remainder of a division with 2 will always be 0 or 1. The assertion makes this assumption explicit: if &lt;code&gt;countNumberOfUsers&lt;/code&gt; does return a negative value, the program may have a bug.

A major advantage of this technique is that when an error does occur it is detected immediately and directly, rather than later through its often obscure side-effects. Since an assertion failure usually reports the code location, one can often pin-point the error without further debugging.

Assertions are also sometimes placed at points the execution is not supposed to reach. For example, assertions could be placed at the &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; clause of the &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement in languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. Any case which the programmer does not handle intentionally will raise an error and the program will abort rather than silently continuing in an erroneous state. In [[D (programming language)|D]] such an assertion is added automatically when a &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement doesn't contain a &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; clause.

In [[Java (programming language)|Java]], assertions have been a part of the language since version 1.4. Assertion failures result in raising an &lt;code&gt;AssertionError&lt;/code&gt; when the program is run with the appropriate flags, without which the assert statements are ignored. In [[C (programming language)|C]], they are added on by the standard header &lt;code&gt;[[assert.h]]&lt;/code&gt; defining &lt;code&gt; assert (''assertion'') &lt;/code&gt; as a macro that signals an error in the case of failure, usually terminating the program. In [[C++]], both &lt;code&gt;assert.h&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cassert&lt;/code&gt; headers provide the &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; macro.

The danger of assertions is that they may cause side effects either by changing memory data or by changing thread timing. Assertions should be implemented carefully so they cause no side effects on program code.

Assertion constructs in a language allow for easy [[test-driven development]] (TDD) without the use of a third-party library.

=== Assertions during the development cycle ===

During the [[development cycle]], the programmer will typically run the program with assertions enabled. When an assertion failure occurs, the programmer is immediately notified of the problem. Many assertion implementations will also halt the program's execution: this is useful, since if the program continued to run after an assertion violation occurred, it might corrupt its state and make the cause of the problem more difficult to locate. Using the information provided by the assertion failure (such as the location of the failure and perhaps a [[stack trace]], or even the full program state if the environment supports [[core dump]]s or if the program is running in a [[debugger]]), the programmer can usually fix the problem. Thus assertions provide a very powerful tool in debugging.

=== Assertions in production environment ===
When a program is deployed to [[production environment|production]], assertions are typically turned off, to avoid any overhead or side effects they may have. In some cases assertions are completely absent from deployed code, such as in C/C++ assertions via macros. In other cases, such as Java, assertions are present in the deployed code, and can be turned on in the field for debugging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/assert.html Programming With Assertions], [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/assert.html#enable-disable Enabling and Disabling Assertions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Assertions may also be used to promise the compiler that a given edge condition is not actually reachable, thereby permitting certain [[compiler optimizations|optimizations]] that would not otherwise be possible. In this case, disabling the assertions could actually reduce performance.

=== Static assertions ===

Assertions that are checked at compile time are called static assertions.

Static assertions are particularly useful in compile time [[template metaprogramming]], but can also be used in low-level languages like C by introducing illegal code if (and only if) the assertion fails. [[C1X|C11]] and [[C++11]] support static assertions directly through &lt;code&gt;static_assert&lt;/code&gt;. In earlier C versions,  a static assertion can be implemented, for example, like this:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
#define SASSERT(pred) switch(0){case 0:case pred:;}

SASSERT( BOOLEAN CONDITION );
&lt;/source&gt;

If the &lt;code&gt;(BOOLEAN CONDITION)&lt;/code&gt; part evaluates to false then the above code will not compile because the compiler will not allow two [[Switch statement#C and languages with C-like syntax|case labels]] with the same constant. The boolean expression must be a compile-time constant value, for example &lt;code&gt;(sizeof(int)==4)&lt;/code&gt; would be a valid expression in that context.  This construct does not work at file scope (i.e. not inside a function), and so it must be wrapped inside a function.

Another popular&lt;ref&gt;Jon Jagger, ''[http://www.jaggersoft.com/pubs/CVu11_3.html Compile Time Assertions in C]'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; way of implementing assertions in C is:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
static char const static_assertion[ (BOOLEAN CONDITION)
                                    ? 1 : -1
                                  ] = {'!'};
&lt;/source&gt;

If the &lt;code&gt;(BOOLEAN CONDITION)&lt;/code&gt; part evaluates to false then the above code will not compile because arrays may not have a negative length. If in fact the compiler allows a negative length then the initialization byte (the &lt;code&gt;'!'&lt;/code&gt; part) should cause even such over-lenient compilers to complain. The boolean expression must be a compile-time constant value, for example &lt;code&gt;(sizeof(int)==4)&lt;/code&gt; would be a valid expression in that context.

Both of these methods require a method of constructing unique names.  Modern compilers support a &lt;code&gt;__COUNTER__&lt;/code&gt; preprocessor define that facilitates the construction of unique names, by returning monotonically increasing numbers for each compilation unit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.3/changes.html GNU, "GCC 4.3 Release Series&amp;nbsp;— Changes, New Features, and Fixes"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[D (programming language)|D]] provides static assertions through the use of &lt;code&gt;static assert&lt;/code&gt;,.&lt;ref&gt;Static assertions in D''http://dlang.org/version.html#StaticAssert''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disabling assertions ==

Most languages allow assertions to be enabled or disabled globally, and sometimes independently. Assertions are often enabled during development and disabled during final testing and on release to the customer.  Not checking assertions avoids the cost of evaluating the assertions while (assuming the assertions are free of [[Side-effect (computer science)|side effects]]) still producing the same result under normal conditions.  Under abnormal conditions, disabling assertion checking can mean that a program that would have aborted will continue to run.  This is sometimes preferable.

Some languages, including [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], completely remove assertions at compile time using the [[preprocessor]].  Java requires an option to be passed to the run-time engine in order to enable assertions.  Absent the option, assertions are bypassed, but they always remain in the code unless optimised away by a JIT compiler at run-time or excluded by an if(false) condition at compile time, thus they need not have a run-time space or time cost in Java either.

Programmers can build checks into their code that are always active by bypassing or manipulating the language's normal assertion-checking mechanisms.

== Comparison with error handling ==

Assertions are distinct from routine error-handling. Assertions document logically impossible situations and discover programming errors: if the impossible occurs, then something fundamental is clearly wrong with the program. This is distinct from error handling: most error conditions are possible, although some may be extremely unlikely to occur in practice. Using assertions as a general-purpose error handling mechanism is unwise: assertions do not allow for recovery from errors; an assertion failure will normally halt the program's execution abruptly; and assertions are often disabled in production code. Assertions also do not display a user-friendly error message.

Consider the following example of using an assertion to handle an error:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
  int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);
  assert(ptr);
  // use ptr
  ...
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, the programmer is aware that &lt;code&gt;[[malloc]]&lt;/code&gt; will return a [[Null pointer|&lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; pointer]] if memory is not allocated. This is possible: the operating system does not guarantee that every call to &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; will succeed.  If an out of memory error occurs the program will immediately abort.  Without the assertion, the program would continue running until &lt;code&gt;ptr &lt;/code&gt;was dereferenced, and possibly longer, depending on the specific hardware being used.  So long as assertions are not disabled, an immediate exit is assured.  But if a graceful failure is desired, the program has to handle the failure.  For example, a server may have multiple clients, or may hold resources that will not be released cleanly, or it may have uncommitted changes to write to a datastore.  In such cases it is better to fail a single transaction than to abort abruptly.

Another error is to rely on side effects of expressions used as arguments of an assertion. One should always keep in mind that assertions might not be executed at all, since their sole purpose is to verify that a condition which should always be true does in fact hold true. Consequently, if the program is considered to be error-free and released, assertions may be disabled and will no longer be evaluated.

Consider another version of the previous example:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
  int *ptr;
  // Statement below fails if malloc() returns NULL,
  // but is not executed at all when compiling with -NDEBUG!
  assert(ptr = malloc(sizeof(int) * 10));
  // use ptr: ptr isn't initialised when compiling with -NDEBUG!
  ...
&lt;/source&gt;

This might look like a smart way to assign the return value of &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;ptr&lt;/code&gt; and check if it is &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; in one step, but the &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; call and the assignment to &lt;code&gt;ptr&lt;/code&gt; is a side effect of evaluating the expression that forms the &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; condition. When the &lt;code&gt;NDEBUG&lt;/code&gt; parameter is passed to the compiler, as when the program is considered to be error-free and released, the &lt;code&gt;assert()&lt;/code&gt; statement is removed, so &lt;code&gt;malloc()&lt;/code&gt; isn't called, rendering &lt;code&gt;ptr&lt;/code&gt; uninitialised. This could potentially result in a [[segmentation fault]] or similar [[null pointer]] error much further down the line in program execution, causing bugs that may be [[Heisenbug|sporadic]] and/or difficult to track down.  Programmers sometimes use a similar VERIFY(X) define to alleviate this problem.

Modern compilers may issue a warning when encountering the above code.&lt;ref&gt;https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html#index-Wparentheses-367&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1947 reports by [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] and [[Herman Goldstine|Goldstine]]&lt;ref&gt;Goldstine and von Neumann. [https://library.ias.edu/files/pdfs/ecp/planningcodingof0103inst.pdf"Planning and Coding of problems for an Electronic Computing Instrument"]. Part II, Volume I, 1 April 1947, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; on their design for the [[IAS machine]], they described algorithms using an early version of [[Flowchart|flow charts]], in which they included assertions: "It may be true, that whenever C actually reaches a certain point in the flow diagram, one or more bound variables will necessarily possess certain specified values, or possess certain properties, or satisfy certain properties with each other. Furthermore, we may, at such a point, indicate the validity of these limitations. For this reason we will denote each area in which the validity of such limitations is being asserted, by a special box, which we call an assertion box."

The assertional method for proving correctness of programs was advocated by [[Alan Turing]]. In a talk "Checking a Large Routine" at Cambridge, June 24, 1949 Turing suggested: "How can one check a large routine in the sense of making sure that it's right? In order that the man who checks may not have too difficult a task, the programmer should make a number of definite ''assertions'' which can be checked individually, and from which the correctness of the whole program easily follows".&lt;ref&gt;Alan Turing. [http://www.turingarchive.org/viewer/?id=462&amp;title=01 Checking a Large Routine], 1949; quoted in C. A. R. Hoare, "The Emperor's Old Clothes", 1980 Turing Award lecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business Technology Management''' (BTM) is an emerging trans-disciplinary research area and professional discipline in [[Outline of academic disciplines#Business administration|Business Administration]].

Building upon other business disciplines, such as [[Management information system|Management Information Systems]] (MIS) and [[Innovation management|Technology and Innovation Management]] (TIM), it seeks to provide an [[integrated framework]] for the strategic use of technology and the [[digital transformation]] of organizations.

BTM is evolving similarly to other research areas in business, e.g., professional disciplines of [[Change Management]] (CM) and [[Management Consulting]], developed from foundations in [[Organizational Behavior]] (OB), [[Strategic Management]] (SM), and [[Operations Management]] (OM).

A new BTM program accreditation standard has been developed by ITAC Talent, a division of the [[IT Association of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://itactalent.ca/talent-initiatives/btm/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; It was mandated by the Government of Canada to develop and update the educational standards of BTM programs in the country.

'''Carolyn Ellis''' is an interdisciplinary scholar and qualitative researcher, widely regarded as an originator and developer of [[autoethnography]], a reflexive approach to research, writing, and storytelling that connects the autobiographical and personal to the cultural, social, and political.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C., Adams, T., &amp; Bochner, A. (2010). Autoethnography: An Overview. Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung /Forum: Qualitative Social Research, 12(1), Online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lcoastpress.com/books_author.php?id=43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holman Jones, S. (2004). Building Connections in Qualitative Research. Carolyn Ellis and Art Bochner in Conversation With Stacy Holman Jones. Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung/Forum: Qualitative Social Research, 5(3), Online.&lt;/ref&gt; She is a [[Distinguished University Professor]] at the [[University of South Florida]] and an Honorary Professor at the [[Communication University of China]]. She served as President of the Society for the Study of [[Symbolic Interaction]] and is a founding member of the Ethnography Division in the [[National Communication Association]] and the Section on Emotions in the [[American Sociological Association]]. Among her publications are a documentary film, five monographs, six edited books, and more than 150 articles, book chapters, and essays on [[autoethnography]], [[ethnography]], compassionate and interactive interviewing, research ethics, death and dying, minor bodily stigmas, caregiving, intimate relationships, health and illness, and research with [[Holocaust]] survivors.&lt;ref&gt;http://communication.usf.edu/faculty/cellis/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://usf.academia.edu/CarolynEllis.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Ellis was born and raised in [[Luray, Virginia]], a rural mountain community. Her mother, Katherine Ellis, was a homemaker and worked with her father, Arthur Ellis, Sr., who owned a construction company.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. (2009). Revision: Autoethnographic Reflections on Life and Work. Walnut Creek, CA: Left Coast Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis’s interest in ethnography began when she read [[Erving Goffman|Erving Goffman's]] (1959) Presentation of Self in Everyday Life as an undergraduate sociology major at the [[College of William and Mary]]. For her undergraduate honor’s thesis she carried out an ethnographic study of an isolated fishing community. She continued this fieldwork while she was a graduate student in sociology at [[State University of New York, Stony Brook]], where she received her Ph.D. in 1981. Her dissertation was a comparative study of two fishing villages, which was later published as Fisher Folk: Two Communities on [[Chesapeake Bay]], winning the [[Robert E. Park]] Award in 1988 for outstanding research monograph from the American Sociological Association section on Communities and [[Urban Sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;Holman Jones, S. (2004). Building Connections in Qualitative Research. Carolyn Ellis and Art Bochner in Conversation With Stacy Holman Jones. Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung/Forum: Qualitative Social Research, 5(3), Online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://communication.usf.edu/faculty/cellis/&lt;/ref&gt;

Her childhood, hometown, and family are the focus of several of her autoethnographies, including articles about race relations in [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]],&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. (1995). The Other Side of the Fence: Seeing Black and White in a Small, Southern Town. Qualitative Inquiry, 1(2), 147-167.&lt;/ref&gt; caregiving for her mother,&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. (1996). Maternal Connections. In C. Ellis &amp; A. Bochner (Eds.), Composing Ethnography: Alternative Forms of Qualitative Writing (pp. 240-243). Walnut Creek, CA: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. (2001). With Mother/With Child: A True Story. Qualitative Inquiry, 7(5), 598-616.&lt;/ref&gt; coping with the sudden loss of her brother Rex who died in 1982 in a [[Air Florida Flight 90|commercial airplane crash]],&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. (1993). ‘There Are Survivors': Telling a Story of Sudden Death. The Sociological Quarterly, 34(4), 711-730.&lt;/ref&gt; and a book chapter about long-term grief and continuing bonds with Rex.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. (2014). Seeking My Brother’s Voice: Holding onto Long-Term Grief through Photographs, Stories, and Reflections.” (Lead chapter) In Stories of Complicated Grief: A Critical Anthology, edited by Eric Miller. Washington, D. C.: NASW (National Association of Social Workers Press), pp. 3-21.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Ellis published Final Negotiations: A Story of Love, Loss, and Chronic Illness about a nine-year relationship with Eugene Weinstein, a sociologist who died in 1985.

== Research and Teaching ==
Ellis has established an international reputation for distinguished and continuous contributions to qualitative inquiry, particularly [[autoethnography]]. The innovative methodological approaches she has developed in the narrative study of [[subjectivity]] have been widely adopted by researchers across the human sciences and throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Holman Jones, S. (2004). Building Connections in Qualitative Research. Carolyn Ellis and Art Bochner in Conversation With Stacy Holman Jones. Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung/Forum: Qualitative Social Research, 5(3). Online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berry, K. (2008). Promise in Peril: Ellis and Pelias and the Subjective Dimensions of Ethnography, Review of Communication, 8(2), 154-173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Santoro, P., &amp; Boylorn, R. (2008). Imagining possibilities: Honoring the work of Carolyn Ellis and Art Bochner. Qualitative Inquiry, 14(2), 195-211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis, C. (2013). Carolyn Ellis: Sharing a Voice through the Power of Story. In Conversations about Qualitative Communication Research: Behind the Scenes with Leading Scholars. Walnut Creek, CA: Left Coast Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holman Jones, S., Adams, T., &amp; Ellis, C. (Eds.) (2013). Handbook of Autoethnography. Walnut Creek, CA: Left Coast.&lt;/ref&gt; Her research explores emotion, subjectivity, and embodiment, producing studies that encourage compassion and empathy from readers and help them understand how to cope with life’s stresses and struggles. She has organized two international conferences, participated in many panel and paper sessions, and given keynote presentations and workshops in sixteen countries. Numerous special issues of journals, review symposia, documentaries and conference sessions have featured her work, some of which has been translated into Chinese, Spanish, and Polish.&lt;ref&gt;http://communication.usf.edu/faculty/cellis/&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis spent the first sixteen years of her academic career in the Department of Sociology at the University of South Florida before moving to the Department of Communication in 1996. In 1990, she became co-director of the Institute for Interpretive Human Studies at USF, a position she held until 2012. In 1996, she and [[Art Bochner]] co-edited Composing Ethnography: Alternative Forms of Qualitative Writing, a book widely recognized as the first volume to promote forms of autoethnographic inquiry designed to bridge humanities and social science research. Ellis and [[Art Bochner|Bochner]] teamed up as editors of two book series emphasizing [[autoethnography]] and personal narrative, which have yielded more than thirty books representing evocative and novel forms of representing lived experience, bringing conscious attention to emotions, subjectivity, embodiment, and personal storytelling.

In 2000, Ellis and [[Art Bochner|Bochner]] published the handbook chapter, “Autoethnography, Personal Narrative, Reflexivity: Researcher as Subject,” in The Handbook of Qualitative Research. The chapter has been cited in more than 3,000 academic texts.&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10785170855687010850&amp;as_sdt=800005&amp;sciodt=1,15&amp;hl=en.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the [[National Communication Association|NCA]] awarded Ellis and Bochner the Charles H. Woolbert Award for this chapter, which has “stood the test of time.”

In 2002, “With Mother/With Child: A True Story” was awarded a Distinguished Publication Award by the NCA Ethnography Division. The article details a day of interaction with Ellis’s aging mother as Ellis assists her in the nightly routine of preparing for bed. The surrounding frame describes her reading this personal story to her mother and probes methodological and ethical issues in writing about intimate others.

In 2005, The Ethnographic I: A Methodological Novel about Autoethnography was awarded the Best Book Award by the NCA Ethnography Division. Ellis published Revision: Autoethnographic Reflections on Life and Work in 2009, which adds the component of meta-autoethnography, layering new interpretations, reflections, and vignettes to her older work. The book received the [[Charles H. Cooley]] Best Book Award from the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction and the Best Book Award from the International Center for Qualitative Inquiry.

Ellis received the Lifetime Achievement Award in Qualitative Inquiry from the International Center for Qualitative Inquiry in 2012, and a Legacy Lifetime Award from the NCA Ethnography Division in 2013. The Handbook of Autoethnography, co-authored with Stacy Holman Jones and Tony Adams, received the Best Edited Collection award from the NCA Ethnography Division in 2013. That same year she chaired the Department of Communication at the University of South Florida and was named a Distinguished Professor at the university.&lt;ref&gt;http://communication.usf.edu/faculty/cellis/&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis also has extended the autoethnographic approach to the study of Holocaust survivors and their testimonies, focusing on the healing power of personal storytelling, and the development of compassionate, collaborative approaches to research with survivors of trauma and genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. &amp; Rawicki, J. (2013). Collaborative Witnessing of Survival during the Holocaust: An Exemplar of Relational Autoethnography, Qualitative Inquiry, 19, 366-380.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. &amp; Patti, C. (2014). With Heart: Compassionate Interviewing and Storytelling with Holocaust Survivors. Storytelling, Self, Society, 10, 389-414.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her numerous teaching honors include the University of South Florida Outstanding Undergraduate University Teaching Awards, the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction Feminist Mentor Award, and the McKnight Foundation’s William R. Jones Award for mentoring African American and Hispanic graduate students. Ellis has inaugurated and taught several undergraduate and graduate courses at the University of South Florida, including: Autoethnography; Writing Lives; Personal Storytelling; Communicating Illness, Grief, and Loss; Emotions, Trauma, and Intimate Interviewing; and Race, Class, and Emotions.&lt;ref&gt;http://communication.usf.edu/faculty/cellis/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3565">'''The Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts (CSNTM)''' is a non-profit organization set out to preserve ancient manuscripts of the New Testament. This aim is accomplished by taking high resolution digital photographs of all extant Greek New Testament [[biblical manuscripts|manuscripts]]. The organization was founded by [[Daniel B. Wallace]], a professor at [[Dallas Theological Seminary]], in Texas on September 13, 2002, and acts under the umbrella of The Center for the Research of Early Christian Documents (CRECD). Wallace is the executive director of CSNTM. 

Wallace has said the goal of the center is to photograph 1.3 million leaves of Greek New Testament manuscripts, and estimates this goal will not be reached until 2020.&lt;ref name="dallasnews"&gt;Fleck, Deborah"[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/religion/stories/DN-relnewtestament_08met.ART.Central.Edition1.4688c1c.html Fleck, Deborah, "Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts working to preserve ancient pieces,"] The Dallas Morning News, March 8, 2008. Retrieved April 18, 2008. Additional information from other sources.&lt;/ref&gt; The CSNTM team has already photographed manuscripts in [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople at the Ecumenical Patriarchate of the Orthodox Church]]; the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research|Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung]] (INTF) in Münster, Germany; [[Tübingen University]], Germany; the Monastery of St. John the Theologian on the island of Patmos, Greece; the National Archive in Tirana, Albania; the [[University of Michigan]]; several colleges at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]; [[University of Glasgow]]; [[Gennadius Library]]; [[Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana]], The [[Chester Beatty Library]], various locations throughout Greece, and other sites. The Center and Wallace have also examined manuscripts in Vienna, Cologne, Florence, Berlin, at St. Catherine’s Monastery (Sinai), The [[Vatican City|Vatican]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], [[Oxford University]], the University of Dresden, [[Harvard University]], the British Library, [[Princeton University]], and several other sites.

The activity of CSNTM is limited by several factors, including international law, finances, and the traditional thinking of the other institutions regarding the copying of valuable manuscripts. In spite of these difficulties CSNTM has digital images of:
* [[Codex Sinaiticus]]
* [[Codex Alexandrinus]]
* [[Codex Vaticanus]]
* [[Codex Washingtonianus]]
* [[Codex Boernerianus]]
* [[Codex Beratinus]]

Although the primary focus of the CSNTM is [[digital preservation]] of New Testament manuscripts, it also works with printed books related to textual criticism such as von Soden's Greek New Testament ("Die Schriften des Neuen Testaments, in ihrer ältesten erreichbaren Textgestalt hergestellt auf Grund ihrer Textgeschichte," Verlag von Arthur Glaue, Berlin 1902-1910).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3397">The '''Coastal and Marine Institute Laboratory''' (CMIL), formerly known as the '''Coastal Waters Laboratory''', is an academic [[laboratory]] operated by the [[San Diego State University College of Sciences|College of Sciences]] of [[San Diego State University|San Diego State University (SDSU)]], in the [[Point Loma, San Diego|Point Loma]] district of [[San Diego]], [[California]]. 

It is located on a coastal site at northern [[San Diego Bay]], on the former grounds of the closed [[Naval Training Center San Diego|San Diego Naval Training Center]], now part of the [[Liberty Station]] redevelopment project in Point Loma.

==Research==
The Laboratory focuses research on environmental and ecological problems on the [[Southern California Bight]] coastline in [[southern California]],  caused by [[urbanization]] in the coastal environment at land-water interfaces, such as [[estuary|estuaries]].

===Current Research Projects===
*Coastal GIS Center
*Wetlands Restoration Center (Pacific Estuarine Research Lab)
*Coastal and Marine Ecology Group
*Beach Water Quality Center

===HPWREN===
Data is transferred back from the Laboratory via the [[High Performance Wireless Research and Education Network|High Performance Research and Education Network (HPWREN)]].

===Equipment===
*50,000 square foot Coastal Waters Laboratory
*10,000 square feet devoted to outdoor aquaria and a greenhouse
*Continuous flow seawater system from San Diego Bay
*Large hall for classes, lectures, and workshops on resource issues

'''Collapse action''' is a device behaviour that snaps a switch into place, usually using a bistable element. When flipping a light switch, strain on one spring increases until it flips position, pulling down the switch.  Collapse action allows one to remove their hand from the switch without risk of it falling to the down position, as the force needed to overcome the resistance is too great. The action also does not exert force in the lower position, avoiding a spontaneous rise to the up position.

{{short description|genre of dramatic works intended to be humorous}}
{{about|a genre of dramatic works|other uses|Comedy (disambiguation)|the popular meaning of the term "comedy"|Humour}}{{Literature}}
In a modern sense, '''Comedy''' (from the {{lang-el|[[wikt:κωμῳδία|κωμῳδία]]}}, ''kōmōidía'') refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be [[humor]]ous or amusing by inducing [[laughter]], especially in [[theatre]], [[television]], [[film]], [[stand-up comedy]], or any other medium of entertainment. The origins of the term are found in [[Ancient Greece]]. In the [[Athenian democracy]], the [[public opinion]] of voters was influenced by the [[political satire]] performed by the [[comic poets]] at the [[Ancient Greek theatre|theaters]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J. (1993) ''Comic Hero versus Political Elite'' pp. 307–19 in {{cite book |editor1=Sommerstein, A.H. |editor2=S. Halliwell |editor3=J. Henderson |editor4=B. Zimmerman |title=Tragedy, Comedy and the Polis |year=1993 |publisher=Levante Editori |location=Bari}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing [[agon]] or conflict. [[Northrop Frye]] depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old."&lt;ref&gt;([[Anatomy of Criticism]], 1957)&lt;/ref&gt; A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic [[irony]] which provokes [[laughter]].&lt;ref&gt;Marteinson, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Satire]] and [[political satire]] use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor. [[Parody]] subverts popular genres and forms, critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them.

Other forms of comedy include [[screwball comedy]], which derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters, and [[black comedy]], which is characterized by a form of humor that includes darker aspects of human behavior or human nature.  Similarly [[Toilet humor|scatological humor]], sexual humor, and [[ethnic joke|race humor]] create comedy by violating [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] or [[taboo]]s in comic ways. A [[comedy of manners]] typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper-class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. [[Romantic comedy]] is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.

==Etymology==
[[File: Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|Tragic Comic Masks of [[Theatre of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek Theatre]]
represented in the  [[Hadrian's Villa]] mosaic]]
The word "comedy" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] κωμῳδία ''kōmōidía'', which is a compound either of [[komos|κῶμος]] ''kômos'' (revel) or κώμη ''kṓmē'' (village) and ᾠδή ''ōidḗ'' (singing); it is possible that ''κῶμος'' itself is derived from ''κώμη'', and originally meant a village revel. The adjective "comic" (Greek κωμικός ''kōmikós),'' which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of "laughter-provoking".&lt;ref name = "Cornford1934pn"&gt;Cornford (1934){{Page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of this, the word came into modern usage through the Latin ''comoedia'' and Italian ''commedia'' and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.&lt;ref name = OED&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] confined their use of the [[word]] "comedy" to descriptions of stage-plays with happy endings. [[Aristotle]] defined comedy as an imitation of men worse than the average (where [[tragedy]] was an imitation of men better than the average). However, the characters portrayed in comedies were not worse than average in every way, only insofar as they are Ridiculous, which is a species of the Ugly. The Ridiculous may be defined as a mistake or deformity not productive of pain or harm to others; the mask, for instance, that excites laughter is something ugly and distorted without causing pain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard McKeon|McKeon, Richard]]. ''The Basic Works Of Aristotle'', the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2001, p. 1459.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle Ages]], the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings.  It is in this sense that [[Dante]] used the term in the title of his poem, ''[[The Divine Comedy|La Commedia]]''.

As time progressed, the word came more and more to be associated with any sort of performance intended to cause laughter.&lt;ref name = OED/&gt; During the Middle Ages, the term "comedy" became synonymous with [[satire]], and later with [[humour]] in general.

Aristotle's [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']] was translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], where it was elaborated upon by [[Arabic literature|Arabic writers]] and [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]], such as Abu Bischr, and his pupils [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]. They disassociated comedy from [[Greek drama]]tic representation and instead identified it with [[Arabic poetry|Arabic poetic]] themes and forms, such as ''[[hija]]'' (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the "art of reprehension", and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or to the troubling beginnings and happy endings associated with classical Greek comedy.

After the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], the term "comedy" gained a more general meaning in [[medieval literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/470561|title=Comedy as Satire in Hispano-Arabic Spain|first=Edwin J.|jstor=470561|last=Webber|journal=Hispanic Review|volume=26|issue=1|date=January 1958|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, many scholars preferred to use the term ''[[laughter]]'' to refer to the whole [[gamut]] of the comic, in order to avoid the use of ambiguous and problematically defined genres such as the [[grotesque]], [[irony]], and [[satire]].&lt;ref&gt;Herman Braet, Guido Latré, Werner Verbeke (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6mqDEpy0YUsC&amp;pg=PA1 ''Risus mediaevalis: laughter in medieval literature and art''] p.1 quotation: {{quotation|The deliberate use by Menard of the term 'le rire' rather than 'l'humour' reflects accurately the current evidency to incorporate all instances of the comic in the analysis, while the classification in genres and fields such as grotesque, humour and even irony or satire always poses problems. The terms humour and laughter are therefore pragmatically used in recent historiography to cover the entire spectrum.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;, Ménard, Philippe (1988) ''Le rire et le sourire au Moyen Age dans la littérature et les arts. Essai de problématique'' in Bouché, T. and Charpentier H. (eds., 1988) ''Le rire au Moyen Âge, Actes du colloque international de Bordeaux'', pp. 7–30&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Western history of comedy===
==== Dionysiac origins, Aristophanes and Aristotle ====
{{see also|Old Comedy|Menander|Ancient Greek comedy}}

[[File:Samia (Girl from Samos) Mytilene 3cAD.jpg|thumb|[[Roman Empire|Roman-era]] [[Roman mosaic|mosaic]] depicting a scene from [[Menander]]'s comedy ''[[Samia (play)|Samia]]'' ("The Woman from Samos")]]
Starting from 425 BCE, [[Aristophanes]], a comic playwright and satirical author of the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek Theater]], wrote 40 comedies, 11 of which survive.  Aristophanes developed his type of comedy from the earlier [[satyr plays]], which were often highly [[obscene]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristophanes (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=YhaawA_m9SEC&amp;pg=PR9 ''Lysistrata''], Introduction, p.ix, published by Nick Hern Books&lt;/ref&gt; The only surviving examples of the satyr plays are by [[Euripides]], which are much later examples and not representative of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Reckford, Kenneth J. (1987)[https://books.google.com/books?id=v9MSdTvbOFAC&amp;pg=PA105 ''Aristophanes' Old-and-new Comedy: Six essays in perspective''] p.105&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Greece, comedy originated in bawdy and [[ribald]] songs or recitations apropos of [[phallic processions]] and fertility festivals or gatherings.&lt;ref name = "Cornford1934p3"&gt;[[Francis MacDonald Cornford|Cornford, F.M.]] (1934) [https://books.google.com/books?id=uhE9AAAAIAAJ ''The Origin of Attic Comedy''] pp.3-4 quotation: {{quotation|That Comedy sprang up and took shape in connection with Dionysiac or Phallic ritual has never been doubted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 335 BCE, [[Aristotle]], in his work ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', stated that comedy originated in [[phallic processions]] and the light treatment of the otherwise base and ugly. He also adds that the origins of comedy are obscure because it was not treated seriously from its inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1449a |title=Aristotle, Poetics, lines beginning at 1449a |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, comedy had its own [[Muse]]: [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]].

[[Aristotle]] taught that comedy was generally positive for society, since it brings forth happiness, which for [[Aristotle]] was the ideal state, the final goal in any activity. For Aristotle, a comedy did not need to involve sexual humor.  A comedy is about the fortunate rise of a sympathetic character. Aristotle divides comedy into three categories or subgenres:  [[farce]], [[romantic comedy]], and [[satire]].  On the contrary, [[Plato]] taught that comedy is a destruction to the self. He believed that it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning. In ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', he says that the guardians of the state should avoid laughter, "for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction." Plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state.

Also in ''Poetics'', Aristotle defined comedy as one of the original four genres of [[literature]]. The other three genres are [[tragedy]], [[epic poetry]], and [[lyric poetry]]. Literature, in general, is defined by Aristotle as a [[mimesis]], or imitation of life. Comedy is the third form of literature, being the most divorced from a true mimesis. Tragedy is the truest mimesis, followed by epic poetry, comedy, and lyric poetry. The genre of comedy is defined by a certain pattern according to Aristotle's definition. Comedies begin with low or base characters seeking insignificant aims and end with some accomplishment of the aims which either lightens the initial baseness or reveals the insignificance of the aims.

====Early Renaissance forms of comedy====
{{main|Divine Comedy|Dante}}
The ''Divine Comedy'' ({{lang-it|Divina Commedia}} {{IPA-it|diˈviːna komˈmɛːdja|}}) is a long [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]] by [[Dante Alighieri]], begun c. 1308 and completed in 1320, a year before his death in 1321. It is widely considered to be the preeminent work in [[Italian literature]]&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Encyclopedia Americana'', 2006, Vol. 30. p.&amp;nbsp;605: "the greatest single work of Italian literature;" John Julius Norwich, ''The Italians: History, Art, and the Genius of a People'', Abrams, 1983, p.&amp;nbsp;27: "his tremendous poem, still after six and a half centuries the supreme work of Italian literature, remains&amp;nbsp;– after the legacy of ancient Rome&amp;nbsp;– the grandest single element in the Italian heritage;" and Robert Reinhold Ergang, ''The Renaissance'', Van Nostrand, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;103: "Many literary historians regard the Divine Comedy as the greatest work of Italian literature. In world literature, it is ranked as an epic poem of the highest order."&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the greatest works of [[world literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Bloom | first=Harold | authorlink=Harold Bloom | title=The Western Canon | year=1994}} See also [[Western canon]] for other "canons" that include the ''Divine Comedy''.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem's imaginative vision of the [[afterlife]] is representative of the [[medieval philosophy|medieval world-view]] as it had developed in the [[Catholic Church|Western Church]] by the 14th century. It helped establish the [[Tuscan language]], in which it is written, as the standardized [[Italian language]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book| last=Lepschy | first=Laura |author2=Lepschy, Giulio | title=The Italian Language Today | year=1977}} or any other history of [[Italian language]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is divided into three parts: ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', ''[[Purgatorio]]'', and ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]''.

The narrative describes Dante's travels through [[Christian views on hell|Hell]], [[Purgatory]], and Paradise or [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter E. Bondanella, ''The Inferno'', Introduction, p.&amp;nbsp;xliii, Barnes &amp; Noble Classics, 2003, {{ISBN|1593080514}}: "the key fiction of the ''Divine Comedy'' is that the poem is true."&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|allegorically]] the poem represents the soul's journey towards God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dorothy L. Sayers]], ''Hell'', notes on page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Dante draws on medieval Christian theology and philosophy, especially [[Thomism|Thomistic philosophy]] and the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Allen Dinsmore, ''The Teachings of Dante'', Ayer Publishing, 1970, p.&amp;nbsp;38, {{ISBN|0836955218}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the ''Divine Comedy'' has been called "the ''Summa'' in verse".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-AQTAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22the+Summa+in+verse%22&amp;dq=%22the+Summa+in+verse%22&amp;cd=10 ''The Fordham Monthly''] Fordham University, Vol. XL, Dec. 1921, p.&amp;nbsp;76&lt;/ref&gt;  In Dante's work, Virgil is presented as human reason and Beatrice is presented as divine knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Approaches to teaching Dante's Divine comedy|date=1982|publisher=Modern Language Association of America|others=Slade, Carole., Cecchetti, Giovanni, 1922–1998.|isbn=978-0873524780|location=New York|oclc=7671339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was originally simply titled ''Comedia'' (so also in the first printed edition, published in 1472). The adjective ''Divina'' was added by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], and the first edition to name the poem ''Divina Comedia'' in the title was that of the Venetian [[Renaissance Humanism|humanist]] [[Lodovico Dolce]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron Terpening|Ronnie H. Terpening]], ''Lodovico Dolce, Renaissance Man of Letters'' (Toronto, Buffalo, London: University of Toronto Press, 1997), p.&amp;nbsp;166.&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1555 by [[Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari]].

The ''Divine Comedy'' is composed of 14,233 lines that are divided into three ''cantiche'' (singular ''cantica'')&amp;nbsp;– ''Inferno'' ([[Hell]]), ''Purgatorio'' ([[Purgatory]]), and ''Paradiso'' ([[Heaven|Paradise]])&amp;nbsp;– each consisting of 33 [[canto]]s (Italian plural  ''canti'')&lt;!--NOTE: BEFORE ADDING "Inferno has 34" (AGAIN) READ THE NEXT SENTENCE--&gt;. An initial [[canto]], serving as an introduction to the poem and generally considered to be part of the first ''cantica'', brings the total number of cantos to 100. It is generally accepted, however, that the first two cantos serve as a unitary prologue to the entire epic, and that the opening two cantos of each ''cantica'' serve as prologues to each of the three ''cantiche''.&lt;ref&gt;Dante The Inferno A Verse Translation by Professor Robert and Jean Hollander p.&amp;nbsp;43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epist. XIII 43 to 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins E.H The Prologue to the Divine Comedy Annual Report of the Dante Society, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Commedia dell'arte and Shakespearean, Elizabethan comedy ====
[[File:MND title page.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Title page of the [[first quarto]] of Shakespeare's ''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1600)]]
"Comedy", in its [[Elizabethan]] usage, had a very different meaning from modern comedy. A Shakespearean comedy is one that has a happy ending, usually involving marriages between the unmarried characters, and a tone and style that is more light-hearted than Shakespeare's other plays.&lt;ref&gt;Regan, Richard. "[http://www.faculty.fairfield.edu/rjregan/rrScom.htm Shakespearean comedy]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Punch and Judy]] show has roots in the 16th-century Italian [[commedia dell'arte]]. The figure of Punch derives from the Neapolitan stock character of [[Pulcinella]].&lt;ref name="eb1911-punch"&gt;{{cite EB1911|last=Wheeler|first=R. Mortimer|wstitle=Punch (puppet)|title=Punch|volume=22|pages=648–649}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure who later became Mr. Punch made his first recorded appearance in England in 1662.&lt;ref name="British seaside"/&gt; Punch and Judy are performed in the spirit of outrageous comedy — often provoking shocked laughter — and are dominated by the anarchic clowning of Mr. Punch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr Punch celebrates 350 years of puppet anarchy|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17895716|agency=BBC|date=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appearing at a significant period in British history, professor Glyn Edwards states: "[Pulcinella] went down particularly well with Restoration British audiences, fun-starved after years of [[Puritanism]]. We soon changed Punch's name, transformed him from a marionette to a hand puppet, and he became, really, a spirit of Britain — a subversive maverick who defies authority, a kind of puppet equivalent to our [[political cartoon]]s."&lt;ref name="British seaside"&gt;{{cite news|title=Punch and Judy around the world|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatlife/7949781/Punch-and-Judy-around-the-world.html|agency=The Telegraph|date=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 19th to early 20th century ====
In early 19th century England, [[pantomime]] acquired its present form which includes slapstick comedy and featured the first mainstream [[clown]] [[Joseph Grimaldi]], while comedy routines also featured heavily in British [[music hall]] theatre which became popular in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Richards (2014). "The Golden Age of Pantomime: Slapstick, Spectacle and Subversion in Victorian England". I.B.Tauris,&lt;/ref&gt; British [[comedian]]s who honed their skills in music hall sketches include [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Dan Leno]].&lt;ref name="Karno"/&gt; English music hall comedian and theatre impresario [[Fred Karno]] developed a form of sketch comedy without dialogue in the 1890s, and Chaplin and Laurel were among the comedians who worked for his company.&lt;ref name="Karno"&gt;McCabe, John. "Comedy World of Stan Laurel". p. 143. London: Robson Books, 2005, First edition 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Karno was a pioneer of [[slapstick]], and in his biography, Laurel stated, "Fred Karno didn't teach Charlie [Chaplin] and me all we know about comedy. He just taught us most of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burton|first1=Alan|title=Pimple, pranks &amp; pratfalls: British film comedy before 1930|date=2000|publisher=Flicks Books|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film producer [[Hal Roach]] stated: "Fred Karno is not only a genius, he is the man who originated slapstick comedy. We in Hollywood owe much to him."&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Gallagher (1971). "Fred Karno: master of mirth and tears". p. 165. Hale.&lt;/ref&gt; American [[vaudeville]] emerged in the 1880s and remained popular until the 1930s, and featured comedians such as [[W. C. Fields]], [[Buster Keaton]] and the [[Marx Brothers]].

====20th century theatre and art====
{{See also|Surreal humour|Theatre of the Absurd|Absurdist fiction}}

[[Surreal humour]] (also known as 'absurdist humour'), or 'surreal comedy', is a form of [[humour]] predicated on deliberate violations of [[Causality|causal]] reasoning, producing events and behaviours that are obviously [[illogical]]. Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, incongruity, [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequiturs]], irrational or absurd situations and expressions of [[nonsense]].&lt;ref name=stockwell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stockwell|first1=Peter|title=The Language of Surrealism|page=177|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KZhNDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=Surreal%20humour&amp;pg=PA177#v=onepage&amp;q=Surreal%20humour&amp;f=false|isbn=978-1137392190|date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The humour arises from a subversion of audience's expectations, so that amusement is founded on [[predictability|unpredictability]], separate from a logical analysis of the situation. The humour derived gets its appeal from the ridiculousness and unlikeliness of the situation. The genre has roots in [[Surrealism]] in the arts.&lt;ref name=stockwell/&gt;

[[File:Edward Lear and His Cat Foss 1885.jpg|thumb|''Edward Lear, Aged 73 and a Half and His Cat Foss, Aged 16'', an 1885 lithograph by [[Edward Lear]]]]
Surreal humour is the effect of [[logic|illogic]] and [[absurdity]] being used for humorous effect. Under such premises, people can identify precursors and early examples of surreal humour at least since the 19th century, such as [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'', which both use illogic and absurdity ([[hookah]]-smoking [[caterpillars]], [[croquet]] matches using live [[flamingos]] as mallets, etc.) for humorous effect. Many of [[Edward Lear]]'s children stories and poems contain [[literary nonsense|nonsense]] and are basically surreal in approach. For example, ''The Story of the Four Little Children Who Went Round the World'' (1871) is filled with contradictory statements and odd images intended to provoke amusement, such as the following:
{{quote|After a time they saw some land at a distance; and when they came to it, they found it was an island made of water quite surrounded by earth. Besides that, it was bordered by evanescent isthmuses with a great Gulf-stream running about all over it, so that it was perfectly beautiful, and contained only a single tree, 503 feet high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lear|first=Edward|title=Nonsense Songs, Stories, Botany, and Alphabets|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13650/13650-h/13650-h.htm#children|date=2004-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the early 20th century, several [[avant-garde]] movements, including the [[Dadaism|dadaists]], [[Surrealism|surrealists]], and [[Futurism (art)|futurists]], began to argue for an art that was random, jarring and illogical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Futurism: The Precursors, Protagonists, and Legacies|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2012|editor1-last=Buelens|editor1-first=Geert|editor2-last=Hendrix|editor2-first=Harald|editor3-last=Jansen|editor3-first=Monica|isbn=978-0739173879}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of these movements were in some sense serious, and they were committed to undermining the solemnity and self-satisfaction of the contemporary artistic [[wikt:establishment|establishment]]. As a result, much of their art was intentionally amusing.

A famous example is [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' (1917), an inverted urinal signed "R. Mutt". This became one of the most famous and influential pieces of art in history, and one of the earliest examples of the [[found object]] movement. It is also a joke, relying on the inversion of the item's function as expressed by its title as well as its incongruous presence in an art exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3671180/Duchamps-Fountain-The-practical-joke-that-launched-an-artistic-revolution.html|first=Martin|last=Gayford|title=Duchamp's Fountain: The practical joke that launched an artistic revolution|date=16 February 2008|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of cinema in the late 19th century, and later radio and television in the 20th century broadened the access of comedians to the general public. Charlie Chaplin, through silent film, became one of the best-known faces on earth. The silent tradition lived on well into the 20th century through mime artists like [[Marcel Marceau]], and the physical comedy of artists like [[Rowan Atkinson]] as [[Mr. Bean]]. The tradition of the circus clown also continued, with such as [[Bozo the Clown]] in the United States and [[Oleg Popov]] in Russia. Radio provided new possibilities — with Britain producing the influential [[Goon Show]] after the Second World War. [[American cinema]] has produced a great number of globally renowned comedy artists, from [[Laurel and Hardy]], the [[Three Stooges]], [[Abbott and Costello]], [[Martin and Lewis|Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis]], as well as [[Bob Hope]] during the mid-20th century, to performers like [[George Carlin]], [[Robin Williams]], and [[Eddie Murphy]] at the end of the century. [[Hollywood]] attracted many international talents like the British comics [[Peter Sellers]], [[Dudley Moore]] and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], Canadian comics [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Jim Carrey]], and [[Mike Myers]], and the [[Australian comedy|Australian comedian]]  [[Paul Hogan]], famous for ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]''. Other centres of creative comic activity have been the [[cinema of Hong Kong]], [[Bollywood]], and French [[farce]].

American television has also been an influential force in world comedy: with American series like ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' achieving large followings around the world. British television comedy also remains influential, with quintessential works including ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', [[Monty Python]], ''[[Dad's Army]]'', ''[[Blackadder]]'', and ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''. Australian satirist [[Barry Humphries]], whose comic creations include the housewife and "gigastar" Dame [[Edna Everage]], for his delivery of Dadaist and [[Absurdism|absurdist]] humour to millions, was described by biographer Anne Pender in 2010 as not only "the most significant theatrical figure of our time ... [but] the most significant comedian to emerge since Charlie Chaplin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/books/absurd-moments-in-the-frocks-of-the-dame-20100914-15ar3.html |title=Absurd moments: in the frocks of the dame |first=Steve |last=Meacham |publisher=Brisbanetimes.com.au |date=2010-09-15 |accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-Western history of comedy===

==== Classical Sanskrit Dramas, Plays, and Epics of Ancient India ====
{{See also|Sanskrit Drama|Mahabharata|Bhagavata Purana}}
By 200 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theatre in Your Life|page=218|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xeUbCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=|author=Robert Barton, Annie McGregor|publisher=CengageBrain|isbn=978-1285463483|date=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ancient [[Sanskrit drama]], [[Bharata Muni]]'s ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' defined humour (''hāsyam'') as one of the nine ''[[nava rasas]]'', or principle ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasas]]'' (emotional responses), which can be inspired in the audience by ''bhavas'', the imitations of emotions that the actors perform. Each ''rasa'' was associated with a specific ''bhavas'' portrayed on stage. In the case of humour, it was associated with mirth (''hasya'').

== Studies on the theory of the comic ==
The phenomena connected with [[laughter]] and that which provokes it have been carefully investigated by psychologists. They agree the predominant characteristics are incongruity or contrast in the object and shock or emotional seizure on the part of the subject. It has also been held that the feeling of superiority is an essential factor: thus [[Thomas Hobbes]] speaks of laughter as a "sudden glory". Modern investigators have paid much attention to the origin both of laughter and of smiling, as well as the development of the "play instinct" and its emotional expression.

[[George Meredith]] said that "One excellent test of the civilization of a country ... I take to be the flourishing of the Comic idea and Comedy, and the test of true Comedy is that it shall awaken thoughtful laughter." Laughter is said to be the cure for being sick. Studies show that people who laugh more often get sick less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ep.tc/realist/15/03.html |title=An impolite interview with Lenny Bruce |journal=The Realist |issue=15 |date=February 1960 |page=3 |accessdate=2011-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emotional-literacy-education.com/classic-books-online-b/esycm10.htm |title=Essay on Comedy, Comic Spirit |first=George |last=Meredith|publisher=Encyclopedia of the Self, by Mark Zimmerman |year=1987 |accessdate=2011-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American literary theorist [[Kenneth Burke]] writes that the "comic frame" in rhetoric is "neither wholly euphemistic, nor wholly debunking—hence it provides the charitable attitude towards people that is required for purposes of persuasion and co-operation, but at the same time maintains our shrewdness concerning the simplicities of ‘cashing in.’" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newantichoicerhetoric.web.unc.edu/the-comedic-frame/|title=The Comic Frame|author=|date=|website=newantichoicerhetoric.web.unc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the comic frame is to satirize a given circumstance and promote change by doing so. The comic frame makes fun of situations and people, while simultaneously provoking thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kbjournal.org/biebel|title=Standing Up for Comedy: Kenneth Burke and The Office – KB Journal|author=|date=|website=www.kbjournal.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic frame does not aim to vilify in its analysis, but rather, rebuke the stupidity and foolery of those involved in the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ithaca.edu/hs/history/journal/papers/sp02comedyandtragedy.html|title=History – School of Humanities and Sciences |publisher= Ithaca College|author=|date=|website=www.ithaca.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, on ''[[The Daily Show]]'', [[Jon Stewart]] uses the "comic frame" to intervene in political arguments, often offering crude humor in sudden contrast to serious news. In a segment on President Obama's trip to China Stewart remarks on America's debt to the Chinese government while also having a weak relationship with the country. After depicting this dismal situation, Stewart shifts to speak directly to President Obama, calling upon him to "shine that turd up."&lt;ref&gt;Trischa Goodnow Knapp (2011). [https://books.google.com/books?id=OQ9Gu4-tYsQC&amp;pg=PA237 ''The Daily Show and Rhetoric: Arguments, Issues, and Strategies'']. p. 327. Lexington Books, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; For Stewart and his audience, introducing coarse language into what is otherwise a serious commentary on the state of foreign relations serves to frame the segment comically, creating a serious tone underlying the comedic agenda presented by Stewart.

== Forms ==
{{Main|Comedic genres}}

Comedy may be divided into multiple [[genre]]s based on the source of humor, the method of delivery, and the context in which it is delivered.  The different forms of comedy often overlap, and most comedy can fit into multiple genres. Some of the subgenres of comedy are [[farce]], [[comedy of manners]], [[burlesque]], and [[satire]].

Some comedy apes certain cultural forms: for instance, parody and [[satire]] often imitate the conventions of the genre they are parodying or satirizing. For example, in the United States, parodies of newspapers and television news include ''[[The Onion]]'', and ''[[The Colbert Report]]''; in Australia, shows such as ''[[Kath &amp; Kim]],'' [[Utopia (Australian TV series)|''Utopia'']], and ''[[Shaun Micallef's Mad as Hell|Shaun Micallef's Mad As Hell]]'' perform the same role.

Self-deprecation is a technique of comedy used by many comedians who focus on their misfortunes and foibles in order to entertain.

The '''''Da’at Miqra''''' (Hebrew דעת מקרא) is a series of volumes of [[Hebrew]]-language [[biblical]] [[Bible commentary|commentary]] published by the [[Jerusalem]]-based [[Mossad Harav Kook]] and constitutes a cornerstone of contemporary [[Israel]]i [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[bible]] scholarship. The project was headed by [[Yehuda Kiel]], who received the [[Israel Prize]] for his part in the enterprise.

==Overview==
The singularity of ''Da’at Miqra'' lies in its combination of a [[traditional]] outlook and the findings of modern research.  The ''Da’at Miqra'' editors have sought to present an interpretation based primarily upon ''[[Peshat]]'' — the direct, literal reading of the text — as opposed to ''[[Peshat|Drash]]''.  They do so by incorporating [[geographic]] references, [[archaeological]] findings and textual analysis, presenting a clear link between the commentary's traditional approach and contemporary methodology.  There has been some suggestion that the ''Da’at Miqra‘''s dualistic approach reflects an underlying polemic against [[biblical criticism]], without directly addressing the views and queries of [[bible]] critics but via a commentary aimed at debunking their methodology.

==Methodology and structure==
The ''Da’at Miqra'' relies upon the [[Aleppo Codex]] for its basic text.  The commentary includes clarifications of difficult words and [[etymological]] references—particularly with regard to the names of locations mentioned—and contains various notes aimed at demonstrating, expanding upon or presenting alternate views on the text.  Each book of the ''[[Tanakh]]'' is divided into parts, each of which is preceded by a description of the chapter’s division and literary style and a general explanation of the portion.  In addition, each book contains a general introduction aimed at clarifying general issues within the text, such as the dating of its authorship, its historical background, parallels to other biblical books, an explanation of various repeating phrases or personas, and the like.

==Editorial staff==
Editors of the series included  [[Yehuda Elitzur]] of [[Bar-Ilan University]], the [[International Bible Contest]] champion and Bible scholar [[Amos Hakham]],  [[Sha’ul Yisra’eli]] and  [[Mordechai Breuer]].

A '''Development Effectiveness Indicator''' (DEI) is a consolidated measure, used primarily by [[Development_finance_institution|Development Finance Institutions (DFIs)]], of the development effectiveness achieved by an institution. This measure relates directly to the development results achieved through a particular development intervention or financed activity. The DEI is a composite aggregation of a range of performance measures that may incorporate interventions across various sectors within the development arena. The formulation of a development effectiveness indicator was motivated primarily by the limitations of current development effectiveness reviews and the need to provide a dynamic adaptive mechanism to track effectiveness and provide operational and strategic insight. The indicator was produced by Jason Bygate and Karl Meyer in 2016 in South Africa for emerging markets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2501">'''Ehrlich-Lettre ascites carcinoma''' (EAC) is also known as Ehrlich cell. It was originally established as an ascites tumor in mice.

== Ehrlich cell ==
The tumor was cultured ''in vivo'', which became known as the Ehrlich cell.&lt;ref name="WhatWhenHow"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://what-when-how.com/molecular-biology/ehrlich-cells-molecular-biology/ |title=Ehrlich Cells (Molecular Biology) |website=what-when-how.com |access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1948 Ehrlich cultures spread around research institutes all over the world. The Ehrlich cell became popular because it could be expanded by ''in vivo'' passage. This made it useful for biochemical studies involving large amounts of tissues. It could also be maintained ''in vitro'' for more carefully controlled studies. Culture techniques in large-scale, mice passage is less attractive, due to the contamination of the tumor with multifarious host inflammatory cells.&lt;ref name="WhatWhenHow" /&gt;

'''Environmental economics''' is a sub-field of [[economics]] that is concerned with environmental issues. It has become a widely studied topic due to growing concerns in regards to the environment in the twentyfirst century. Quoting from the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] Environmental Economics program:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... Environmental Economics ... undertakes theoretical or empirical studies of the economic effects of national or local environmental policies around the world ... . Particular issues include the costs and benefits of alternative environmental policies to deal with air pollution, water quality, toxic substances, solid waste, and global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Environmental economics is distinguished from [[ecological economics]] in that ecological economics emphasizes the economy as a subsystem of the ecosystem with its focus upon preserving [[natural capital]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eoearth.org/article/Environmental_and_ecological_economics Lead Author: Robert Nadeau Article Topics: Ecological economics and Environmental economics Last Updated: August 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeroen C.J.M. van den Bergh (2001).

==Topics and concepts==
{{Economics sidebar}}

===Market failure===
Central to environmental economics is the concept of [[market failure]].  Market failure means that markets fail to allocate resources efficiently. As stated by Hanley, Shogren, and White (2007) in their textbook ''Environmental Economics'':&lt;ref&gt;Hanley, N., J. Shogren, and B. White (2007). Environmental Economics in Theory and Practice, Palgrave, London.&lt;/ref&gt; "A market failure occurs when the market does not allocate scarce resources to generate the greatest social welfare. A wedge exists between what a private person does given market prices and what society might want him or her to do to protect the environment.  Such a wedge implies wastefulness or economic inefficiency; resources can be reallocated to make at least one person better off without making anyone else worse off." Common forms of market failure include externalities, non-excludability and [[Rivalry (economics)|non-rivalry]].

===Externality===
An [[externality]] exists when a person makes a choice that affects other people in a way that is not accounted for in the market price. An externality can be positive or negative, but is usually associated with negative externalities in environmental economics. For instance, water seepage in residential buildings happen in upper floor affect the lower floor.&lt;ref&gt;Rita Yi Man Li (2012), The Internalisation Of Environmental Externalities Affecting Dwellings: A Review Of Court Cases In Hong Kong, Economic Affairs, Volume 32, Issue 2, pages 81–87&lt;/ref&gt; Another example concerns how the sale of Amazon timber disregards the amount of carbon dioxide released in the cutting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Environmental degradation replaces classic imperialism|last=Chapman|first=Same|date=May 3, 2012|work=The Whitman College Pioneer: Whitman College|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2018}} Or a firm emitting [[pollution]] will typically not take into account the costs that its pollution imposes on others.  As a result, pollution may occur in excess of the 'socially efficient' level, which is the level that would exist if the market was required to account for the pollution. A classic definition influenced by [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[James Meade]] is provided by Heller and Starrett (1976), who define an externality as "a situation in which the private economy lacks sufficient incentives to create a potential market in some good and the nonexistence of this market results in losses of [[Pareto efficiency]]".&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Walter P. and David A. Starrett (1976), On the Nature of Externalities, in: Lin, Stephen A.Y. (ed.), Theory and Measurement of Economic Externalities, Academic Press, New York, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;  In economic terminology, externalities are examples of [[market failure]]s, in which the unfettered market does not lead to an efficient outcome.

===Common goods and public goods===
When it is too costly to exclude some people from access to an environmental resource, the resource is either called a [[common-pool resource|common property resource]] (when there is rivalry for the resource, such that one person's use of the resource reduces others' opportunity to use the resource) or a [[public good]] (when use of the resource is [[rivalry (economics)|non-rivalrous]]). In either case of non-exclusion, market allocation is likely to be inefficient.

These challenges have long been recognized. [[Garrett Hardin|Hardin]]'s (1968) concept of the [[tragedy of the commons]] popularized the challenges involved in non-exclusion and common property. "Commons" refers to the environmental asset itself, "common property resource" or "common pool resource" refers to a property right regime that allows for some collective body to devise schemes to exclude others, thereby allowing the capture of future benefit streams; and "open-access" implies no ownership in the sense that property everyone owns nobody owns.&lt;ref name="Ostrom, E 1990"&gt;Ostrom, E. 1990. Governing the Commons. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic problem is that if people ignore the scarcity value of the commons, they can end up expending too much effort, [[over harvesting]] a resource (e.g., a fishery). Hardin theorizes that in the absence of restrictions, users of an open-access resource will use it more than if they had to pay for it and had exclusive rights, leading to [[environmental degradation]].  See, however, [[Elinor Ostrom|Ostrom]]'s (1990) work on how people using real common property resources have worked to establish self-governing rules to reduce the risk of the tragedy of the commons.&lt;ref name="Ostrom, E 1990"/&gt;

The [[mitigation of climate change]] effects is an example of a public good, where the social benefits are not reflected completely in the market price. This is a public good since the risks of climate change are both non-rival and non-excludable.  Such efforts are non-rival since climate mitigation provided to one does not reduce the level of mitigation that anyone else enjoys.  They are non-excludable actions as they will have global consequences from which no one can be excluded. A country's incentive to invest in carbon abatement is reduced because it can "[[Free rider problem|free ride]]" off the efforts of other countries. Over a century ago, Swedish economist [[Knut Wicksell]] (1896) first discussed how public goods can be under-provided by the market because people might conceal their preferences for the good, but still enjoy the benefits without paying for them.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Valuation ===
Assessing the economic value of the environment is a major topic within the field. Use and indirect use are tangible benefits accruing from [[natural resource]]s or [[ecosystem services]] (see the [[Ecological economics#Nature|nature section]] of ecological economics). Non-use values include existence, option, and bequest values. For example, some people may value the existence of a diverse set of species, regardless of the effect of the loss of a species on ecosystem services. The existence of these species may have an option value, as there may be the possibility of using it for some human purpose. For example, certain plants may be researched for drugs. Individuals may value the ability to leave a pristine environment to their children.

Use and indirect use values can often be inferred from revealed behavior, such as the cost of taking [[travel cost analysis|recreational trips]] or using [[hedonic model|hedonic methods]] in which values are estimated based on observed prices.  Non-use values are usually estimated using stated preference methods such as [[contingent valuation]] or [[choice modelling]]. Contingent valuation typically takes the form of surveys in which people are asked how much they would pay to observe and recreate in the environment ([[willingness to pay]]) or their willingness to accept (WTA) compensation for the destruction of the environmental good. [[Hedonic pricing]] examines the effect the environment has on economic decisions through housing prices, traveling expenses, and payments to visit parks.&lt;ref&gt;Harris J. (2006). ''Environmental and Natural Resource Economics: A Contemporary Approach''. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solutions==
Solutions advocated to correct such externalities include:

* '' [[United States Environmental Protection Agency#Related legislation|Environmental regulations]]''. Under this plan, the economic impact has to be estimated by the regulator. Usually this is done using [[cost-benefit analysis]].  There is a growing realization that regulations (also known as "command and control" instruments) are not so distinct from economic instruments as is commonly asserted by proponents of environmental economics.  E.g.1 regulations are enforced by fines, which operate as a form of tax if pollution rises above the threshold prescribed.  E.g.2 pollution must be monitored and laws enforced, whether under a pollution tax regime or a regulatory regime.  The main difference an environmental economist would argue exists between the two methods, however, is the total cost of the regulation.  "Command and control" regulation often applies uniform emissions limits on polluters, even though each firm has different costs for emissions reductions.  Some firms, in this system, can abate inexpensively, while others can only abate at high cost.  Because of this, the total abatement has some expensive and some inexpensive efforts to abate.  Consequently, modern "Command and control" regulations are oftentimes designed in a way, which addresses these issues by incorporating utility parameters. For instance, CO2 emission standards for specific manufacturers in the automotive industry are either linked to the average vehicle footprint (US system) or average vehicle weight (EU system) of their entire vehicle fleet. Environmental economic regulations find the cheapest emission abatement efforts first, then the more expensive methods second.  E.g. as said earlier, trading, in the quota system, means a firm only abates if doing so would cost less than paying someone else to make the same reduction.  This leads to a lower cost for the total abatement effort as a whole.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* ''[[quota on pollution|Quotas on pollution]]''. Often it is advocated that pollution reductions should be achieved by way of [[tradeable emissions permits]], which if freely traded may ensure that reductions in pollution are achieved at least cost. In theory, if such tradeable quotas are allowed, then a firm would reduce its own pollution load only if doing so would cost less than paying someone else to make the same reduction.  In practice, tradeable permits approaches have had some success, such as the U.S.'s sulphur dioxide trading program or the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, and interest in its application is spreading to other environmental problems.
* ''[[Tax, tariff and trade|Taxes and tariffs on pollution]]''. Increasing the costs of polluting will discourage polluting, and will provide a "dynamic incentive," that is, the disincentive continues to operate even as pollution levels fall.  A pollution tax that reduces pollution to the socially "optimal" level would be set at such a level that pollution occurs only if the benefits to society (for example, in form of greater production) exceeds the costs. Some advocate a major shift from taxation from income and sales taxes to tax on pollution - the so-called "[[green tax shift]]."
* ''Better defined [[property rights]]''. The [[Coase Theorem]] states that assigning property rights will lead to an optimal solution, regardless of who receives them, if [[transaction costs]] are trivial and the number of parties negotiating is limited. For example, if people living near a factory had a right to clean air and water, or the factory had the right to pollute, then either the factory could pay those affected by the pollution or the people could pay the factory not to pollute. Or, citizens could take action themselves as they would if other property rights were violated. The US River Keepers Law of the 1880s was an early example, giving citizens downstream the right to end pollution upstream themselves if government itself did not act (an early example of [[bioregional democracy]]).  Many markets for "pollution rights" have been created in the late twentieth century—see [[emissions trading]]. According to the Coase Theorem, the involved parties will bargain with each other, which results in an efficient solution. However, modern economic theory has shown that the presence of asymmetric information may lead to inefficient bargaining outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Myerson|first=Roger B|last2=Satterthwaite|first2=Mark A|date=1983|title=Efficient mechanisms for bilateral trading|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0531(83)90048-0|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|volume=29|issue=2|pages=265–281|doi=10.1016/0022-0531(83)90048-0|issn=0022-0531|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Rob (1989) has shown that pollution claim settlements will not lead to the socially optimal outcome when the individuals that will be affected by pollution have learned private information about their disutility already before the negotiations take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rob|first=Rafael|date=1989|title=Pollution claim settlements under private information|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0531(89)90022-7|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|volume=47|issue=2|pages=307–333|doi=10.1016/0022-0531(89)90022-7|issn=0022-0531|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldlücke and Schmitz (2018) have shown that inefficiencies may also result if the parties learn their private information only after the negotiations, provided that the feasible transfer payments are bounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldlücke|first=Susanne|last2=Schmitz|first2=Patrick W.|date=2018|title=Pollution claim settlements reconsidered: Hidden information and bounded payments|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2018.08.005|journal=European Economic Review|volume=110|pages=211–222|doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2018.08.005|issn=0014-2921|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to other fields ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
Environmental economics is related to [[ecological economics]] but there are differences. Most environmental economists have been trained as economists. They apply the tools of economics to address environmental problems, many of which are related to so-called market failures—circumstances wherein the "[[invisible hand]]" of economics is unreliable.  Most ecological economists have been trained as ecologists, but have expanded the scope of their work to consider the impacts of humans and their economic activity on ecological systems and services, and vice versa. This field takes as its premise that economics is a strict subfield of [[ecology]].  Ecological economics is sometimes described as taking a more pluralistic approach to [[natural environment|environmental]] problems and focuses more explicitly on long-term environmental sustainability and issues of scale.

Environmental economics is viewed as more pragmatic in a [[price system]]; ecological economics as more idealistic in its attempts not to use [[money]] as a primary arbiter of decisions. These two groups of specialists sometimes have conflicting views which may be traced to the different philosophical underpinnings.

Another context in which [[Externality|externalities]] apply is when [[globalization]] permits one player in a market who is unconcerned with [[biodiversity]] to undercut prices of another who is - creating a [[race to the bottom]] in regulations and conservation. This, in turn, may cause loss of [[natural capital]] with consequent erosion, water purity problems, diseases, desertification, and other outcomes which are not [[Pareto efficiency|efficient]] in an economic sense. This concern is related to the subfield of [[sustainable development]] and its political relation, the [[anti-globalization movement]].

Environmental economics was once distinct from [[resource economics]]. Natural resource economics as a subfield began when the main concern of researchers was the optimal commercial exploitation of natural resource stocks. But resource managers and policy-makers eventually began to pay attention to the broader importance of natural resources (e.g. values of fish and trees beyond just their commercial exploitation). It is now difficult to distinguish "environmental" and "natural resource" economics as separate fields as the two became associated with [[sustainability]].  Many of the more radical [[green economists]] split off to work on an alternate [[political economy]].

Environmental economics was a major influence on the theories of [[natural capitalism]] and [[environmental finance]], which could be said to be two sub-branches of environmental economics concerned with resource conservation in production, and the [[value of biodiversity]] to humans, respectively.  The theory of [[natural capitalism]] (Hawken, Lovins, Lovins) goes further than traditional environmental economics by envisioning a world where natural services are considered on par with [[Capital (economics)|physical capital]].

The more radical [[Green economists]] reject neoclassical economics in favour of a new [[political economy]] beyond [[capitalism]] or [[communism]] that gives a greater emphasis to the interaction of the human economy and the natural environment, acknowledging that "economy is three-fifths of ecology" - Mike Nickerson.

These more radical approaches would imply changes to [[money supply]] and likely also a [[bioregional democracy]] so that political, economic, and ecological "environmental limits" were all aligned, and not subject to the [[arbitrage]] normally possible under [[capitalism]].

An emerging sub-field of environmental economics studies its intersection with [[development economics]]. Dubbed "envirodevonomics" by [[Michael Greenstone]] and B. Kelsey Jack in their paper "Envirodevonomics: A Research Agenda for a Young Field," the sub-field is primarily interested in studying "why environmental quality [is] so poor in developing countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greenstone |first1=Michael |last2=Jack |first2=B. Kelsey |title=Envirodevonomics: A Research Agenda for an Emerging Field |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=5–42 |doi=10.1257/jel.53.1.5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A strategy for better understanding this correlation between a country's GDP and its environmental quality involves analyzing how many of the central concepts of environmental economics, including market failures, externalities, and willingness to pay, may be complicated by the particular problems facing developing countries, such as political issues, lack of infrastructure, or inadequate financing tools, among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inclusive green growth the pathway to sustainable development.|date=May 2012|publisher=World Bank|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-9552-3|pages=12–13|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTSDNET/Resources/Inclusive_Green_Growth_May_2012.pdf|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''fantasy defense''' is where a defendant accused of attempting a crime (enticing [[Minor (law)|minors]] into sexual activity, for example) claims that they never intended to complete the crime. Instead, they claim they were engaged in a fantasy and, in the case of luring a minor, believed they were dealing with an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferraro|first=Monique Mattei|title=Investigating Child Exploitation and Pornography: The Internet, the Law and Forensic Science|year=2005|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=978-0-12-163105-5|page=283|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BtjzJhcAAGYC&amp;lpg=PA283&amp;dq=%22Fantasy%20defense%22%20-Android%20-football%20-itunes%20-wikipedia%20-game%20-football&amp;pg=PA283#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Casey, Eoghan|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''flute circle''' is an organization of musicians which focuses on the [[Native American flute]].
Flute circles typically meet periodically to engage in educational and recreational
activities surrounding the instrument.
Most flute circles offer instruction on the Native American flute,
especially for flutists who are new to the instrument.
Many flute circles have a facilitator with experience in group music facilitation and
[[humanistic education|humanistic music education]]
to structure the activities and the music-making.&lt;ref name="JonesThesis"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of the Native American flute in community music is notably different from traditional uses of the
instrument for courtship, hunting, or ceremony.&lt;ref name="Densmore1957"&gt;

 | accessdate = March 16, 2010
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
This new use of the instrument has not been without controversy,
and flute circles are generally advised to use the instrument in a respectful manner because of
these considerations.&lt;ref name="Wapp1984a"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Flute circle participants may span a wide range of experience and training in music &amp;mdash;
from professionals to novice flutists or enthusiasts
of the Native American flute.&lt;ref name="WFS_Roster"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many flute circles focus on raising the level of [[musicality]] of the participants
across a range of levels of musical experience using basic [[Ternary form|song forms]], [[Musical improvisation|music improvisation]], and techniques of experiential [[music education]].
These techniques include [[duet]] and [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] improvisation forms that include [[Drone (music)|drone]]s, [[ostinato]] patterns, and [[call and response]] forms.&lt;ref name="Oshinsky2008"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21–25}}
Facilitation forms include ''traveling ensembles'', ''showcasing'', ''segmenting'', and general ''conducted improvisations'' &amp;mdash;
techniques that are shared with other community music structures such as
[[drum circle]]s.&lt;ref name="Hull1998"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

While some flute circles focus on aspects of [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous cultures]]
and [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]],
they do not typically relate to a single culture or tribe.&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Flute circles can also organize events for participants to play at events,
festivals, school presentations,
or in service settings such as senior centers, elder facilities, and group homes.
Flute circles have also engaged in their own concerts, produced music albums,
and broadcast live music performances.&lt;ref name="ThrivingFluteCircles"&gt;

== Community music ==

Flute circles are one type of community music gathering. Other types include [[drum circle]]s, community choirs, facilitated dance, and community orchestras. However, Mary Jane Jones argues in her thesis that flute circles have particular attributes not found in other types of community music gatherings:
{{quote |text=If the goal of flute players is to express themselves through a Native American-based musical means, it could be argued that they should be able to do that just as effectively through drumming or dancing. The answer may lie with the fact that, as a wind instrument, the flute uses not just the hands, but also the breath. Singing is the ultimate form of personal musical expression. The sound is formed from within the body and the words from within the mind. For people who feel that their voices are inadequate or are hindered from singing traditional Native songs because of their inability to speak their ancestral language, using the breath to produce sound through a simple cylinder may serve as a satisfying substitute. The flute can give them a voice.&lt;ref name="JonesThesis"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|57}}}}

== Organizations ==

Several national organizations have formed to provide support to local flute circles:

* [http://worldflutesociety.org/ WFS] &amp;mdash; [[World Flute Society]] (U.S.A.)
* [http://flutetree.org/ FTF] &amp;mdash; FluteTree Foundation (U.S.A.) (formerly RNAFF, Renaissance of the North American Flute Foundation)
* [http://jifca.com/ JIFCA] &amp;mdash; Japan Indian Flute Circle Association (日本インディアンフルートサークル協会) (Japan)

A roster of registered flute circles is maintained by WFS&lt;ref name="WFS_Roster" /&gt;
and FTF.&lt;ref name="RNAFF_Roster"&gt;{{cite web

=== Statistics ===

As of March 13, 2016, the roster of flute circles in this article listed 189 organizations in 9 countries, including flute circles in 44 States of the United States and 5 Provinces of Canada.

==== Historical ====
The chart below depicts the historical number of flute circles registered with the WFS (shown in darker blue) and its predecessor organization, the International Native American Flute Association ("INAFA") (shown in lighter blue).

The data for years prior to 2016 were gathered on March 13, 2016 from historical WFS and INAFA web pages provided by the [[Wayback Machine]].
The data for 2016 and 2017 were gathered from the live WFS web site on March 4, 2016 and January 3, 2017, respectively.

The data point for each year was taken on the first date in the year that the respective web site was updated. Data for the years 2012&amp;ndash;2014 represents the shift in organizations from INAFA to WFS.
The data roughly agrees with the Jones thesis, which reported 115 flute circles on the INAFA roster in 2010.&lt;ref name="JonesThesis" /&gt;{{rp|53}}

A '''gabion''' (from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''gabbione'' meaning "big cage"; from Italian ''gabbia'' and Latin ''cavea'' meaning "cage") is a [[Cage (enclosure)|cage]], [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], or box filled with rocks, concrete, or sometimes sand and soil for use in civil engineering, road building, military applications and [[landscaping]].

For erosion control, caged [[riprap]] is used. For dams or in foundation construction, cylindrical metal structures are used. In a military context, earth- or sand-filled gabions are used to protect [[Sapper|sappers]], infantry, and [[artillery]]men from enemy fire.

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] designed a type of gabion called a ''Corbeille Leonard'' ("Leonard[o] basket") for the foundations of the San Marco Castle in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gabiondesign.be/gabion.html gabiondesign.be]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106053216/http://gabiondesign.be/gabion.html |date=January 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gabion 040.jpg|thumb|left|Bridge abutment with gabions]]

==Civil engineering==
The most common civil engineering use of gabions was refined and [[patent]]ed by Gaetano [[Maccaferri]] in the late 19th century in Sacerno, Emilia Romagna and used to stabilize shorelines, stream banks or slopes against [[erosion]]. Other uses include retaining walls, [[noise barrier]]s, temporary [[flood wall]]s, [[silt]] filtration from runoff, for small or temporary/permanent dams, river training, or channel lining. They may be used to direct the force of a flow of flood water around a vulnerable structure.

Gabions are also used as [[fish screen]]s on small streams. Gabion stepped [[weir]]s are commonly used for river training and flood control; the stepped design enhances the rate of energy dissipation in the channel, and it is particularly well suited to the construction of gabion stepped weirs.&lt;ref name="Wuthrich_Chanson2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wuthrich, D. and [[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]]  |title= Hydraulics, Air Entrainment and Energy Dissipation on Gabion Stepped Weir |url= http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:337198  |journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, ASCE |volume=140 |issue=9 |pages= Paper 04014046, 10 pages |doi= 10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000919 |issn= 0733-9429 |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A gabion wall is a [[retaining wall]] made of stacked stone-filled gabions tied together with wire. Gabion walls are usually [[Batter (walls)|''battered'']] (angled back towards the slope), or stepped back with the slope, rather than stacked vertically.

The life expectancy of gabions depends on the lifespan of the wire, not on the contents of the basket. The structure will fail when the wire fails. Galvanized steel wire is most common, but [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]-coated and stainless steel wire are also used. PVC-coated galvanized gabions have been estimated to survive for 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maccaferri-northamerica.com/files/USA028_FallsRoadMD.pdf maccaferri-northamerica.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311001454/http://www.maccaferri-northamerica.com/files/USA028_FallsRoadMD.pdf |date=March 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some gabion manufacturers guarantee a structural consistency of 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gabions.net/featured_projects_2.html |title=Feature Projects - Project 2 |work=gabions.net |accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, gabion use within streams first began with projects completed from 1957 to 1965 on North River, Virginia and Zealand River, New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;Toblaski, R.A., and N.K. Tripp, 1961. ''Gabions for stream and erosion control.'' Journal of Soil and Water Conservation 16: 284-285.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 150 grade-control structures, bank revetments and channel deflectors were constructed on the two U.S. Forest Service sites. Eventually, a large portion of the in-stream structures failed due to undermining and lack of structural integrity of the baskets. In particular, corrosion and abrasion of wires by bedload movement compromised the structures, which then sagged and collapsed into the channels. Other gabions were toppled into channels as trees grew and enlarged on top of gabion revetments, leveraging them toward the river channels.

Gabions have also been used in building, as in the [[Dominus Estate|Dominus Winery]] in the [[Napa County, California|Napa Valley]], [[California]], by architects [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]], constructed between 1995 and 1997. The exterior is formed by modular wire mesh gabions containing locally quarried stone; this construction allows air movement through the building and creates an environment of moderate temperatures inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.floornature.com/projects-commerce/project-herzog-de-meuron-dominus-winery-california-4025/ |title=Dominus Winery in Napa Valley, California, USA. |accessdate=2009-02-22 |publisher=floornature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archiplanet.org/wiki/Dominus_Winery |title=Dominus Winery |accessdate=2009-02-22 |publisher=Archiplanet |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014215250/http://www.archiplanet.org/wiki/Dominus_Winery |archivedate=2008-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations in design==
There are various special designs of gabions to meet particular functional requirements and some special terms for particular forms have come into use. For example:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ridgeway-online.com/MM/assets/CPD/GabionCPD.pdf ridgeway-online.com]{{dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bastion: a gabion lined internally with a membrane, typically of nonwoven [[geotextile]] to permit use of a granular soil fill, instead of rock.
* Mattress: a form of gabion with relatively small height relative to the lateral dimensions; commonly very wide. For protecting surfaces from wave erosion and similar attack, rather than building or supporting high structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foraas.no/wp.../4.Gabion_-_Spesifikasjoner_og_guide_-_030209.pdf foraas.no]{{dead link |date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Trapion: a form of gabion with a [[trapezoid]]al cross section, designed for stacking to give a face that is sloping rather than stepped. The term is in wide usage, but in contexts related to gabions at least, appears to be a trademark registered by Betafence Limited.

==Military use==
[[File:Virginia, Fort Stedman. View of the interior of - NARA - 533357.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of [[Fort Stedman]] in 1865, showing a parapet constructed with gabions to protect gun positions]]
Early gabions were round cages with open tops and bottoms, made from [[wicker]]work and filled with earth for use as military [[fortification]]s.&lt;ref name=Mahan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mahan|first1=Dennis Hart|title=An elementary course of military engineering|date=1870|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101027165289;view=1up;seq=84|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38}} These early military gabions were most often used to protect [[sappers]] and siege [[artillery]] gunners. &lt;ref name=Mahan/&gt;{{rp|39}} The wickerwork cylinders were light and could be carried relatively conveniently in the [[ammunition]] train, particularly if they were made in several [[diameter]]s to fit one inside another. At the site of use in the field, they could be stood on end, staked in position, and filled with soil to form an effective wall around the [[gun]], or rapidly construct a bulletproof parapet along a sap.  During the [[Crimean War]], local shortages of brushwood led to use of scrap hoop-iron from hay bales in its stead; this in turn led to purpose-built sheet-iron gabions.&lt;ref name=Mahan/&gt;{{rp|182}}  

Today, gabions are often used to protect [[forward operating base]]s (FOBs) against explosive, fragmentary, indirect fires such as mortar or artillery fire. Examples of areas within a FOB that make extensive use of gabions are sleeping quarters, mess halls, or any place where there would be a large concentration of unprotected soldiers. Gabions are also used for aircraft revetments, blast walls, and similar structures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2862">The '''Information visualization reference model''' is an example of a reference model for [[information visualization]], developed by [[Ed Chi]] in 1999.,&lt;ref&gt;Ed H. Chi. [http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~echi/phd/ A Framework for Information Visualization Spreadsheets]. Ph.D. Thesis. University of Minnesota, Computer Science Department. March, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; under the name of the ''data state model''. Chi showed that the framework successfully modeled a wide array of visualization applications and later showed that the model was functionally equivalent to the data flow model used in existing graphics toolkits such as [[VTK]].

== Overview ==
In previous work, according to Chi (2000), "researchers have attempted to construct taxonomies of [[information visualization]] techniques by examining the data domains that are compatible with these techniques. This is useful because implementers can quickly identify various techniques that can be applied to their domain of interest. However, these taxonomies do not help the implementers understand how to apply and implement these techniques".&lt;ref name = "EHC00"&gt;

According to Chi (2000), he and J.T. Reidl "in 1998 extends and proposes a new way to taxonomize information visualization techniques by using the ''Data State Model''. Many of the techniques share similar operating steps that can easily be reused. The Data State Model not only helps researchers understand the space of design, but also helps implementers understand how information visualization techniques can be applied more broadly".&lt;ref name = "EHC00"/&gt;

In 1999 [[Stuart Card]], [[Jock D. Mackinlay]], and [[Ben Shneiderman]] present their own interpretation of this pattern, dubbing it the information visualization reference model.&lt;ref&gt;Jock D. Mackinlay (1999). ''Readings in information visualization: using vision to think''. With Stuart K. Card and Ben Shneiderman (eds.), Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc, p686.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johann Albrecht Bengel.jpg|thumb|160 px|Johann Albrecht Bengel]]
'''Johann Albrecht Bengel''' (24 June 1687 – 2 November 1752), also known as ''Bengelius'', was a [[Lutheran]] [[pietist]] [[clergyman]] and [[Koine Greek|Greek-language]] scholar known for his edition of the [[Textus Receptus|Greek New Testament]] and his commentaries on it.

==Life and career==
Bengel was born at [[Winnenden]] in [[Duchy of Württemberg|Württemberg]].&lt;ref name="Major Bib"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weborg|first=C. John|title=Dictionary of major biblical interpreters|year=2007|publisher=IVP Academic|location=Downers Grove, Ill.|isbn=978-0-8308-2927-9|edition=2nd|editor=McKim, Donald K.|page=184|chapter=Bengel, J(ohann) A(lbrecht)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the death of his father in 1693, he was educated by a family friend, David Wendel Spindler,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b9mG-EvdPYgC&amp;pg=PA2|title=A memoir of the life and writings of John Albert Bengel, prelate in Würtemberg|editor=John Christian Frederic Burk|location=London|publisher=R. Gladding, etc|year=1842|page=2|others=[[Robert Francis Walker]], trans}}&lt;/ref&gt; who became a master in the [[Gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasium]] at [[Stuttgart]]. In 1703 Bengel left Stuttgart and entered the [[University of Tübingen]] as a student at the ''[[Tübinger Stift]]'', where, in his spare time, he devoted himself especially to the works of [[Aristotle]] and [[Spinoza]], and, in theology, to those of [[Philipp Jakob Spener|Philipp Spener]], [[Johann Arndt]] and [[August Francke]]. His knowledge of the [[metaphysics]] of Spinoza was such that he was selected by one of the professors to prepare materials for a treatise, ''De Spinosismo'', which was afterwards published.

After acquiring his degree, Bengel devoted himself to [[theology]]. Even at this time he had religious doubts; it is interesting in view of his later work that one cause of his perplexities was the difficulty of ascertaining the true reading of certain passages in the [[Textus Receptus|Greek New Testament]]. In 1707 Bengel entered the ministry and was appointed to the parochial charge of [[Metzingen]]-unter-Urach. In the following year he was recalled to Tübingen to undertake the office of ''Repetent'' (theological tutor).

He remained at Tübingen until 1713, when he was appointed head of a seminary recently established at [[Denkendorf, Baden-Württemberg|Denkendorf]] as a preparatory school of theology. Before entering into his new duties he travelled through the greater part of [[Germany]], studying the systems of education which were in use, and visiting the seminaries of the [[Jesuits]] as well as those of the Lutheran and [[Reformed church]]es. Among other places he went to [[Heidelberg]] and [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], and had his attention directed at [[Heidelberg]] to the canons of scripture criticism published by [[Gerhard von Maastricht]], and at Halle to [[Campeius Vitringa]]'s ''Anacrisis ad Apocalypsin''. The influence exerted by these upon his theological studies is manifest in some of his works.

For 28 years, from 1713 to 1741, he was master ({{lang-de|Klosterpraeceptor}}) of the ''Klosterschule'' at Denkendorf, a seminary for candidates for the ministry established in a former monastery of the [[Canons Regular of the Holy Sepulchre|Canons of the Holy Sepulchre]]. To these years, the period of his greatest intellectual activity, belong many of his chief works.

In 1741 he was appointed prelate (i.e. general superintendent) at [[Herbrechtingen]], where he remained until 1749, when he was raised to the dignity of consistorial counsellor and prelate of [[Alpirsbach]], with a residence in [[Stuttgart]]. He devoted himself to the discharge of his duties as a member of the [[Consistory (Protestantism)|consistory]]. A question of considerable difficulty was at that time occupying the attention of the church courts: the manner in which those who separated themselves from the church were to be dealt with, and the amount of toleration which should be accorded to meetings held in private houses for the purpose of religious edification. The civil power (the duke of Württemberg was a [[Roman Catholic]]) was disposed to have recourse to measures of repression, while the members of the consistory, recognizing the good effects of such meetings, were inclined to concede considerable liberty. Bengel exerted himself on the side of the members of the consistory. In 1751 the [[University of Tübingen]] conferred upon him the degree of [[Doctor of Divinity]]. He died in [[Stuttgart]], aged 65.

Bengel carried on an 18-year-long controversy with [[Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf|Nicolaus Ludwig, Count von Zinzendorf]], leader of the [[Moravian Church|Moravian Brethren]] from [[Herrnhut]] in [[Saxony]]. This led to a break between the Moravian Brethren and the dour Pietism typical of Württemberg, represented by Bengel. With his determined certainty giving him systematic insight into the divine Plan of Salvation, Bengel dogmatically opposed the dynamic, ecumenical, missionary efforts of Zinzendorf, who was indifferent to all dogmatism and intolerance. As Bengel did not hesitate to manipulate historical calendars in his [[chiliasm|chiliastic]] attempts to predict the end of the world, Zinzendorf rejected this as superstitious  “interpretation of signs.”&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph translated from the [[:de:Johann Albrecht Bengel|corresponding article]] in [[:de:Hauptseite|German Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

His reputation as a Biblical scholar and critic rests chiefly on his edition of the Greek New Testament (1734) and his [[Exegesis|exegetical]] annotations on the same, which have passed through many editions in Latin, German, and English and are still highly valued by expositors of the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Manson Myers, The Children of Pride, Yale University Press, 1972, p. 1461&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek New Testament==
[[File:Johann Albrecht Bengel (timbre RFA).jpg|thumb|Stamp issued by the [[Deutsche Bundespost]] to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Bengel's birth]]
Bengel's edition of the Greek New Testament was published at Tübingen in 1734, and at Stuttgart in the same year, but without the critical apparatus. As early as 1725, in an addition to his edition of ''Chrysostoms De Sacerdotio'', he had given an account in his ''Prodromus Novi Testamenti Graeci recte cauteque adornandi'' of the principles on which his intended edition was to be based. In preparation for his work, Bengel was able to avail himself of the collations of upwards of twenty manuscripts, none of them, however, of great importance, twelve of which had been collated by himself. In constituting the text, he imposed upon himself the singular restriction of not inserting any variant reading which had not already been printed in some preceding edition of the Greek text. From this rule, however, he deviated in the case of the [[Apocalypse]], where, owing to the corrupt state of the text, he felt himself at liberty to introduce certain readings on manuscript authority. In the lower margin of the page he inserted a selection of various readings, the relative importance of which he denoted by the first five letters of the Greek alphabet in the following manner: α was employed to denote the reading which in his judgment was the true one, although he did not venture to place it in the text; β, a reading better than that in the text; γ, one equal to the textual reading; and δ, readings inferior to those in the text. [[Robert Estienne]]'s division into verses was retained in the inner margin, but the text was divided into paragraphs.

The text was followed by a critical apparatus, the first part of which consisted of an introduction to the criticism of the [[New Testament]], in the thirty-fourth section of which he laid down and explained his celebrated canon, ''Proclivi scriptioni praestat ardua'' (The difficult reading is to be preferred to that which is easy), the soundness of which, as a general principle, has been recognized by succeeding critics. The second part of the critical apparatus was devoted to a consideration of the various readings, and here Bengel adopted the plan of stating the evidence both against and in favor of a particular reading, thus placing before the reader the materials for forming a judgment. Bengel was the first definitely to propound the theory of families or [[recension]]s of manuscripts.

His investigations had led him to see that a certain affinity or resemblance existed amongst many of the authorities for the Greek text manuscripts, versions, and ecclesiastical writers: for example, if a peculiar reading was found in one of these, it was generally also found in the other members of the same class; and this general relationship seemed to point ultimately to a common origin for all the authorities which presented such peculiarities. Although disposed at first to divide the various documents into three classes, he finally adopted a classification into two: the [[Africa]]n or older family of documents, and the Asiatic, or more recent class, to which he attached only a subordinate value. The theory was afterwards adopted by [[Johann Salomo Semler|J.S. Semler]] and [[Johann Jakob Griesbach|J.J. Griesbach]], and worked up into an elaborate system by the latter critic.

Bengel's labors on the text of the Greek Testament were received with great disfavour in many quarters. Like [[Brian Walton (bishop)|Brian Walton]] and [[John Mill (theologian)|John Mill]] before him, he had to encounter the opposition of those who believed that the certainty of the word of God was endangered by the importance attached to the various readings. [[Johann Jakob Wetstein|JJ Wetstein]], on the other hand, accused him of excessive caution in not making freer use of his critical materials. In answer to these strictures, Bengel published a ''Defence of the Greek Text of His New Testament'', which he prefixed to his ''Harmony of the Four Gospels'', published in 1736, and which contained an answer to the complaints, especially of Wetstein, which had been made against him.

The text of Bengel long enjoyed a high reputation among scholars, and has been frequently reprinted. An enlarged edition of the critical apparatus was published by Philip David Burk in 1763.

==''Gnomon Novi Testamenti''==
The other great work of Bengel, and that on which his reputation as an exegete is mainly based, is his ''Gnomon Novi Testamenti'', or ''Exegetical Annotations on the New Testament'', published in 1742. It was the fruit of twenty years labor, and exhibits with a brevity of expression, which, it has been said, condenses more matter into a line than can be extracted from pages of other writers, the results of his study. He modestly entitled his work a ''[[Gnomon]]'' or index, his object being rather to guide the reader to ascertain the meaning for himself, than to save him from the trouble of personal investigation. The principles of interpretation on which he proceeded were, to import nothing into Scripture, but to draw out of it everything that it really contained, in conformity with grammatico-historical rules not to be hampered by dogmatical considerations; and not to be influenced by the symbolical books. Bengel's hope that the ''Gnomon'' would help to rekindle a fresh interest in the study of the New Testament was fully realized. It has passed through many editions, has been translated into [[German language|German]] and into [[English language|English]] (by [[Marvin Vincent]] in 1860), and is still valued by expositors of the New Testament. [[John Wesley]] made great use of it in compiling his ''Expository Notes upon the New Testament'' (1755).

Besides the two works already described, Bengel was the editor or author of many others, classical, patristic, ecclesiastical and expository. The more important are: ''Ordo Temporum'', a treatise on the chronology of Scripture, in which he enters upon speculations regarding the end of the world, and an ''Exposition of the [[Book of Revelation|Apocalypse]]'' which enjoyed for a time great popularity in Germany, and was translated into several languages. His fame was such that almost 200 years later, [[Hermann Hesse]] has the hero of [[The Glass Bead Game]] discuss Bengel's writings.

'''Kurar''' (كورار, ''kūrār'')) is a type of [[Islamic embroidery|Arabic embroidery]] of weaving gold, silver and silk threads to create ribbons used to decorate clothing.

Each ribbon is made by a group of at least 3 women, the width of ribbon depending on the number of weavers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://culture.gov.bh/en/theevents/FestivalsandAnnualActivities/HeritageFestival/HeritageFestival2014/Craftsmen/Name,11190,en.html#.WtRtU_qsa01 |title=Bahrain Authority for Culture and Antiquities - Kingdom of Bahrain {{!}} Craftsmen |last=MOC |website=culture.gov.bh |language=en |access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After preparing threads, a group of women (2 to 8), sitting in one row, weave threads through their fingers and crossing arms  with next women. One woman, sitting opposite, collects threads and tightens them with a special needle, creating the ribbon.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atharna.com/journal/kurar-embroidery|title=Kurar Embroidery|website=www.atharna.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the whole length has been made, the ribbon is smoothed and polished with special "stones" and finally sewn to the rim of a dress. It takes about three days's work to make one length.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Contemporary art is vanishing and kurar ribbons are being replaced by industrial-made decorations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Leadership studies''' is a [[Interdisciplinary|multidisciplinary]] academic field of study that focuses on [[leadership]] in organizational contexts and in human life. Leadership studies has origins in the [[social science]]s (e.g., [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]]), in [[humanities]] (e.g., [[history]] and [[philosophy]]), as well as in professional and applied fields of study (e.g., [[management]] and [[education]]). The field of leadership studies is closely linked to the field of [[organizational studies]].

As an academic area of inquiry, the study of leadership has been of interest to scholars from a wide variety of disciplinary backgrounds. Today, there are numerous academic programs (spanning several academic colleges and departments) related to the study of leadership. Leadership degree programs generally relate to: aspects of leadership, leadership studies, and organizational leadership (although there are a number of leadership-oriented concentrations in other academic areas).

==Leadership in higher education==

Leadership has become one of the fastest-growing academic fields in higher education&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{Cite journal | last1 = Brungardt | first1 = C.

Guide to College Majors in Leadership (n.d.). ''What is Leadership and Organizational Management?'' http://www.worldwidelearn.com/online-education-guide/business/leadership-major.htm
&lt;/ref&gt;

Even among some of the more established and traditional academic disciplines such as [[engineering]], [[education]], and [[medicine]], specialization and concentration areas have developed around the study of leadership. Most of these academic programs have aimed to be [[Interdisciplinary|multidisciplinary]] in nature—drawing upon theories and applications from related fields such as [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], and [[management]]. Such an approach, Rost (1991) has argued "allows scholars and practitioners to think radically new thoughts about leadership that are not possible from a unidisciplinary approach" (p.&amp;nbsp;2).&lt;ref name="Rost"/&gt;

==History of leadership as a field of study==

The study of [[leadership]] can be dated back to [[Plato]], [[Sun Tzu]] and [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]; however, leadership has only become the focus of contemporary academic studies in the last 60 years, and particularly more so in the last two decades. Contemporary leadership scholars and researchers have often been questioned about the nature of their work, and its place within the academy, but much of the confusion surrounding leadership as a field of study may be attributed to a lack of understanding regarding [[transdisciplinary studies|transdisciplinary]], [[Interdisciplinary|inter-, and multi- disciplinary]] academic fields of study in general.

The discipline (which encompasses a host of sub-fields) is filled with definitions, theories, styles, functions, competencies, and historical examples of successful and diverse leaders. Collectively, the research findings on leadership provide a far more sophisticated and complex view of the phenomenon than most of the simplistic views presented in the popular press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Doh | first1 = J. P | year = 2003 | title = Can leadership be taught? Perspectives from management educators | url = | journal = Academy of Management Learning and Education | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 54–67 | doi = 10.5465/AMLE.2003.9324025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daloz Parks, S. (2005). ''Leadership can be taught: A bold approach for a complex world''. Cambridge: Harvard Business School Press.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest studies on leadership include:

:* The [[Ohio State leadership|Ohio State Leadership Studies]] which began in the 1940s&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and focused on how leaders could satisfy common group needs.  The findings indicated that the two most important dimensions in leadership included: "initiating structure", and "consideration". These characteristics could be either high or low and were independent of one another.  The research was based on questionnaires to leaders and subordinates. These questionnaires are known as the Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire (LBDQ) and the Supervisor Behavior Description Questionnaire (SBDQ).&lt;ref&gt;The Ohio State University (n.d.). Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire (LBDQ) {{cite web |url=http://fisher.osu.edu/offices/fiscal/lbdq |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407022713/http://fisher.osu.edu/offices/fiscal/lbdq |archivedate=2009-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1962, the LBDQ was on version XII.

The Leadership Box (Northern Michigan State University) http://business.nmsu.edu/~dboje/teaching/338/behaviors.htm#katz_michigan&lt;/ref&gt; which began in the 1950s&lt;ref&gt;Katz, D., Maccoby, N., and Morse, N. 1950. ''Productivity, Supervision, and Morale in an Office Situation''. Ann Arbor, MI: Institute for Social Research.&lt;/ref&gt; and indicated that leaders could be classified as either "employee centered," or "job centered."  These studies identified three critical characteristics of effective leaders: task oriented behavior, relationship-oriented behavior, and participative leadership.

:* [[Theory X and theory Y|McGregors Theory X &amp; Theory Y]] developed by [[Douglas McGregor]] in the 1960s at [[MIT Sloan School of Management]]. These theories described employee motivation in the workforce. Both theories begin with the premise that the role of management is to assemble the factors of production, including people, for the economic benefit of the firm. Beyond this point, the two theories of management diverge.

:* Blake &amp; Mouton Managerial Grid (1964) – updated in 1991 to the Blake &amp; McCanse Leadership Grid-developed the orientation of "task orientation" and "people orientation" in leader behavior. They developed the leadership grid which focused on concern for results (on the one axis) and concern for people (on the other axis).

In addition to these studies, leadership has been examined from an academic perspective through several [[Leadership|theoretical lenses]]:

:* [[Leadership#Trait Theory|Trait &amp; behavioral theories of leadership]]: Attempt to describe the types of behavior and personality tendencies associated with effective leadership.

:* [[Leadership#Situational and contingency theories|Situational &amp; contingency theories of leadership]]: Incorporate environmental and situational considerations into leader behavior.

:* [[Leadership#Functional theory|Functional leadership theory]]: Suggests that a leader’s primary responsibility is to see that whatever is necessary in relation to group needs is taken care of.

:* [[Information processing|Information-Processing]] Leadership theory:&lt;ref&gt;Lord, R. (1994). ''Leadership and Information Processing: Linking Perceptions and Performance (People and Organizations)'' https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Information-Processing-Perceptions-Organizations/dp/0415099013&lt;/ref&gt; Focuses on the role of social perception in identifying leadership abilities.

:* Self Leadership theory:&lt;ref&gt;Neck, C. P., &amp; Houghton, J. D. (2006). Two decades of self-leadership theory and research: Past developments, present trends, and future possibilities. ''Journal of Managerial Psychology'' http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&amp;contentId=1554367&lt;/ref&gt; Although behaviorally oriented, the essence of self leadership theory is that behaviors are directed toward the attainment of super-ordinate goals.

:* [[Leadership#Transactional and transformational theories|Transactional &amp; Transformational theories of Leadership]]: The transactional leader focuses on managerial reward and [[contingent valuation]]. The transformational leader focuses on motivation and goal attainment.

''Jepson School of Leadership Studies'' http://jepson.richmond.edu/about/index.html
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research on different types of leadership ==

Empirical, meta-analytic, and theoretical studies have been conducted on various types of leadership.  Some of the styles of leadership studied include:
 
* Ambidextrous leadership
* Democratic Leadership
* [[Innovation leadership]]
* [[Transactional leadership]]
* [[Transformational leadership]]

==Research methods in the study of leadership==

Leadership has been studied using [[Quantitative methods|quantitative]], [[Qualitative research|qualitative]], and mixed methods (a combination of quantitative and qualitative) research methodologies. From a [[quantitative psychology]] orientation, statistical and mathematical modeling has been used in the development of leadership scales, in testing established leader evaluation tools, and in examining perceptions of leaders.&lt;ref&gt;See Hoyt, C. L.; Murphy, S.

As such, traditional methods of analysis in survey research have also extended to the analysis of survey research within the study of leadership (e.g., [[Cross tabulation|cross-tabulations]], [[Analysis of variance|ANOVAs]], [[regression analysis]], [https://archive.is/20121212070319/http://faculty.chass.ncsu.edu/garson/PA765/logit.htm log-linear analysis], [[factor analysis]], etc.). From a qualitative orientation, leadership research has included a host of research techniques: [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]], [[ethnography]],&lt;ref&gt;See von Rueden, C.; van Vugt, M. (2015). “[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2690906 Leadership in small-scale societies: some implications for leadership evolution and practice].” ''The Leadership Quarterly'', '''26''': 978-990.&lt;/ref&gt; [[grounded theory]], [[interviews]], [[case studies]], [[Historical analysis|historiography]],&lt;ref&gt;See Hayter, J. M. (2015). “[http://scholarship.richmond.edu/jolpi/vol18/iss4/6/ To End Divisions: Reflections on the Civil Rights Act of 1964]." ''Richmond Journal of Law and Public Interest'' '''18''' (4): 499–514.&lt;/ref&gt; [[literary criticism]],&lt;ref&gt;See Bezio, K.B. (forthcoming). “[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1742715016663753 From Rome to Tyre to London: Shakespeare’s ''Pericles'', leadership, anti-absolutism, and English exceptionalism].” ''Leadership''.&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

"Coaches and coaching psychologists are increasingly using the lessons and
tools of positive psychology in their practice (Biswas-Diener, 2010)."  An example of leadership research done was by P. Alex Linley and Gurpal Minhas researching the strengths that may be found in more effective strengthspotters; the people who are skilled in the identification and development of strengths in others.  The study consisted of an online survey used to collect data on the Strengthspotting Scale, together with an assessment of 60 different strengths using the Realise2 model (www.realise2.com).  There were 528 respondents to retrieve data from and the results showed that the four strengths connector, enabler, esteem builder and feedback were found across the Strengthspotting Scale.  "The strengths of Connector, Enabler and Feedback were significant predictors for each strengthspotting domain, suggesting that these may be the essence of the personal characteristics of an effective strengthspotter" (Linley and Minhas, 2011).

==Academic programs==
There are a considerable number of doctoral, masters, and undergraduate degree programs related to the study of leadership.  Given that the study of leadership is interdisciplinary, leadership-related degree programs are often situated within various colleges, schools, and departments across different university campuses (e.g., Schools of Education at some universities, Business Schools at other universities, and Graduate and Professional Schools at still other universities). As such, at the doctoral level leadership related degree programs primarily include: [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], [[Doctor of Education|Ed.D.]], and executive doctoral degrees (depending on the situation of the program within the university). At the masters level leadership related degree programs primarily include: Master of Science, Master of Arts, and executive master's degrees. At the undergraduate level leadership related degree programs primarily include: Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts degrees as well as leadership certificate and minor programs.

'''Maintenance''' of an organism is the collection of processes to stay alive, excluding production processes. The [[Dynamic Energy Budget]] theory delineates two classes
* Somatic maintenance mainly comprises the turnover of structural mass (mainly proteins) and the maintenance of concentration gradients of metabolites across membranes (e.g., counteracting leakage). This is related to [[maintenance respiration]].
* Maturity maintenance concerns the maintenance of defence systems (such as the [[immune system]]), and the preparation of the body for reproduction.

The theory assumes that maturity maintenance costs can be reduced more easily during starvation than somatic maintenance costs. Under extreme starvation conditions, somatic maintenance costs are paid from structural mass, which causes shrinking. Some organism manage to switch to the [[turpor]] state under starvation conditions, and reduce their maintenance costs.

MSRI was founded in 1982, and its funding sources include the [[National Science Foundation]], foundations, corporations, and more than 90 universities and institutions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/about-msri/history|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/about-msri/our-mission|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is located at 17 Gauss Way on the [[University of California, Berkeley]] campus, close to [[Grizzly Peak (Berkeley Hills)|Grizzly Peak]] (on the [[Berkeley Hills|hills]] overlooking [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History ==
The Mathematical Sciences Research Institute was founded in September 1982 by three UC Berkeley professors [[Shiing-Shen Chern]], [[Calvin C. Moore|Calvin Moore]], and [[Isadore Singer|Isadore M. Singer]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ias.edu/scholars/shiing-shen-chern|title=Shiing-Shen Chern|work=Institute for Advanced Study|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://math.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/isadore-m-singer-0|title=Isadore M. Singer |publisher=Department of Mathematics at University of California Berkeley |language=en|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shiing-Shen Chern acted as the founding Director of the institute and Calvin Moore acted as the founding Deputy Director. 

MSRI was originally located at the UC Extension Building at 2223 Fulton Street, and on April 1, 1985, MSRI moved into its current facility on Berkeley hills.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Initially, MSRI paid rent for this new building to the [[University of California]]. However, since August 2000, it has occupied the building without the rental burden, as one of several contributions of the UC campus.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Governance ==
MSRI is governed by a Board of Trustees consisting of up to 35 elected members and 7 ex-officio members: the Director of the Institute, the Deputy Director, the Chair of the Committee of Academic Sponsors, the co-Chairs of the Human Resources Advisory Committee and the co-Chairs of the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msri.org/web/msri/about-msri/governance-directory|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many mathematical institutes, MSRI has no permanent faculty or members, and its research activities are overseen by its Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC), a panel of distinguished mathematicians drawn from a variety of different areas of mathematical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/about-msri/governance-directory|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 10 regular members in the SAC, and each member serves a four-year term and is elected by the Board of Trustees.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Research Activities==
MSRI hosts about 85 mathematicians and [[postdoctoral research fellow]]s each semester for extended stays and holds programs and workshops, which draw approximately 2,000 visits by mathematical scientists throughout the year.  The visitors come to MSRI to work in an environment that promotes creativity and the effective interchange of ideas and techniques. MSRI features two focused programs each semester, attended by foremost mathematicians and postdocs from the United States and abroad; the Institute has become a world center of activity in those fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/scientific/programs|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MSRI takes advantage of its close proximity to the [[University of California Berkeley]] and the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] and also collaborates nationally with organizations such as the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]].  The Institute’s prize-winning forty-eight thousand square foot building has views of the [[San Francisco Bay]]. After 30 years of activity, the reputation of the Institute is such that mathematicians make it a professional priority to participate in the Institute’s programs.{{fact|date=January 2018}} 

Because of its contribution to the nation’s scientific potential, MSRI’s activity is supported by the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[National Security Agency]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/support-msri|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private individuals, foundations, and nearly 100 Academic Sponsor Institutions, including the top mathematics departments in the United States, provide crucial support and flexibility. [[James Simons]], founder of [[Renaissance Technologies]] and a [[University of California, Berkeley]] mathematics alumnus, is a long-time supporter of MSRI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/people/230|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education Programs ==
[[File:MSRI - Simons Auditorium 1.jpg|thumb|Simons Auditorium (MSRI)]]
MSRI also serves a wider community through the development of human scientific capital, providing postdoctoral training to young scientists and increasing the diversity of the research workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/education|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute also advances the education of young people with conferences on critical issues in mathematics education. Additionally, they host research workshops that are unconnected to the main programs, such as its annual workshop on [[K-12]] mathematics education ''Critical Issues in Mathematics Education.''   

During the summer, workshops for graduate students are held through the MSRI-UP program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/education/for-undergraduates/msri-up|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSRI sponsors programs for middle and high school students and their teachers as part of the [[Math_circles#Math_circles_in_North_America|Math Circles]] and Circles for Teachers that meet weekly in San Francisco, Berkeley, and Oakland.  It also sponsors the Bay Area Mathematical Olympiad (BAMO), the [[Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival]], and the U.S. team of young girls that competes at the [[China Girls Math Olympiad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/public|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lectures given at MSRI events are videotaped and made available for free on the internet.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msri.org/web/msri/online-videos/special-productions-events|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSRI has sponsored a number of events that reach out to the non-mathematical public, and its Simons Auditorium also hosts special performances of classical music. Mathematician [[Robert Osserman]] has held a series of public "conversations" with artists who have been influenced by mathematics in their work, such as composer [[Philip Glass]], actor and writer [[Steve Martin]], playwright [[Tom Stoppard]], and actor and author [[Alan Alda]].  MSRI also collaborates with local playwrights for an annual program of new short mathematics-inspired plays at Monday Night Playground at the [[Berkeley Repertory Theater]], and co-sponsored a series of mathematics-inspired films with UC Berkeley's [[Pacific Film Archive]] for MSRI's 20th anniversary. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It also created a series of [[mathematical puzzles]] that were posted among the advertising placards on [[San Francisco Municipal Railway|San Francisco Muni]] buses.

The '''Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research''' (abbreviation: '''MPS'''; {{lang-de|Max-Planck-Institut für Sonnensystemforschung}}) is a [[research institute]] in [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]] located in [[Göttingen]], [[Germany]], where it relocated in February 2014 from the nearby village of [[Lindau (Katlenburg-Lindau)|Lindau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mps.mpg.de/66046/neubau 'Neubau'] (in German) on institute website, viewed 2014-07-09&lt;/ref&gt; The exploration of the [[solar system]] is the central theme for research done at this institute.

[[File:MPI Sonnensystemforschung Goettingen.jpeg|thumb|250px|right|New Institute building in Göttingen, built in 2013 and occupied in 2014.]]

MPS is a part of the [[Max Planck Society]], which operates 80 research facilities in [[Germany]].

Over the last five years{{when|date=July 2014}}, members of the Institute have each year published about 270 articles in international journals and books and given 360 conference presentations.

== Research ==
MPS is organised in three departments: 
* [http://www.mps.mpg.de/solar-physics Sun and Heliosphere]
* [http://www.mps.mpg.de/planetary-science Planets and Comets]
* [http://www.mps.mpg.de/helioseismology-asteroseismology Solar and Stellar Interiors]
In addition, since 2002 there is also an [[Max Planck Society#International Max Planck Research Schools|International Max Planck Research School]].
Subjects of research at the Institute are the various objects within the solar system. A major area of study concerns the Sun, its atmosphere, the interplanetary medium as influenced by the solar wind, as well as the impact of solar particles and radiation on the planets. The second area of research involves the interiors, surfaces, atmospheres, ionospheres, and magnetospheres of the planets and their moons, as well as of comets and asteroids.
A further essential part of the activities at the Institute is the development and construction of instruments for space missions. 
The analysis and interpretation of the acquired datasets are accompanied by intensive theoretical work. Physical models are proposed and then tested and further developed with the aid of computer simulations.

=== The Sun and Heliosphere ===
The researchers at the MPS are studying the complete range of dynamic and often spectacular processes occurring on the Sun – from the interior to the outer heliosphere. At the heart of this research is the [[Magnetosphere|magnetic field]], which plays a decisive role in these processes. It is generated by gas currents in the interior of the [[Sun]] and causes, among other things, dark spots on the surface. Answers to the following questions are being sought: Why does the magnetic field change with an eleven-year cycle? How does the magnetic field produce the various structures on the Sun? How is the corona heated to many millions of degrees?
Instruments developed by MPS aboard the space- craft [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] and [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]] have provided fundamentally new insights: Measurements of the ultraviolet spectrometer [[SUMER]] on board [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] played a decisive role in recognising the significance of the magnetic field for dynamic processes and [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]] measured the three-dimensional structure of the solar wind for the first time.
Another important research topic at "The Sun and Heliosphere" department is the influence on the Earth due to the Sun’s variable activity. Scientists are working intensively on the project [[STEREO]], in which two identical spacecraft trace disturbances from the Sun to the Earth from different observational points, permitting predictions of potentially dangerous events.
The physical processes involved in the origin and development of magnetic fields on the Sun take place on very small scales and therefore require measurements with very high spatial resolution. The balloon-borne telescope [[Sunrise (telescope)|Sunrise]], built under Institute leadership and flown in June 2009, was able to make out structures on the Sun’s surface as small as 100&amp;nbsp;kilometers.
Future projects will stress research into the physical causes of the Sun’s variations. The ambitious [[Solar Orbiter]] Mission, based on a suggestion from the Institute, will see a probe approach our star to within a fifth of the Earth-Sun distance in order to investigate the magnetic field and its effects in the various layers of the solar atmosphere.

=== Planets and Comets ===
The Institute develops scientific instruments that fly with spacecraft to other planets. Highly specialized cameras have investigated the [[Saturn]] moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], analyse the surface of [[Mars]], and probe the clouds and winds of [[Venus]]. Microwave instruments determine the composition of atmospheres while infrared spectrometers examine surface rocks. A novel laser altimeter on board [[BepiColumbo]] will survey the topography of [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] to within a meter. Further MPS instruments identify the atoms, electrons, and dust that move around the planets and impact their moons. Here the influence of the [[solar wind]] on the atmospheric gases is of particular interest.
Theoretical studies and intensive computer simulations help to understand the processes both inside and surrounding the planets and to interpret the measured data. Models developed at MPS can describe, for example, interactions with the solar wind, the atmospheric dynamics, or the generation of the terrestrial magnetic field by means of currents deep in the iron core of our planet.
In addition, the Institute has along tradition in cometary research. A major highlight was the camera developed at the Institute for the [[ESA]] spacecraft [[Giotto]] which delivered the first photographs ever of a comet’s nucleus in 1986. A particular challenge was the development of numerous scientific instruments for the [[ESA]] Mission [[Rosetta]], such as cameras, chemical analyzers, and essential components for the landing module Philae. Rosetta was launched in 2004, and matched orbits with the comet [[Churyumov-Gerasimenko]] in 2014; a few months later, Philae landed on the comet’s surface.
The Institute has also provided the cameras for the [[NASA]] [[Dawn Mission]], launched in 2007, to study two of the largest asteroids, Ceres and Vesta.

=== Helio- and Asteroseismology ===
The MPS is hosting the German Data Centre for the NASA’s [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]] (SDO), which has provided improved data on small scales of space and time to study the connections between the solar interior and magnetic activity in the solar atmosphere.
A particularly exciting research activity at the MPS is the study of seismic waves in the vicinity of sunspots. The goal is to probe the subsurface structure of sunspots in three dimensions. [[Sunspot]] [[helioseismology]] is a challenging science as it requires modelling of the propagation of waves through magnetic structures; this can only be achieved by numerical simulations.

== Scientific Projects ==
The institute has been lead/involved in several international scientific projects such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mps.mpg.de/solar-system-research | title =MPS Projects and Research Teams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solar Orbiter]], [[Solar Dynamics Observatory|SDO]], [[Sunrise (telescope)|Sunrise]], [[STEREO]], [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]], [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]], [[BepiColombo]], [[Exomars]], [[Chandrayaan-2|Chandrayaan]], [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix]], [[Herschel Space Observatory|Herschel]], [[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]], [[Venus Express]], [[SMART-1]], [[SOFIA]], [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]], [[Mars Express]], [[Mars DFG]], [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]], [[Cluster (spacecraft)|Cluster]], [[Helios (spacecraft)|Helios]], [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]] and [[Giotto (spacecraft)|Giotto]].

These contributions consist developing of the instruments and/or scientific research activities.

== Degree programme ==

The MPI for Solar System Research offers the [[PhD]] programme "International Max-Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Solar System Science" together with the [[University of Göttingen]]. The Solar System School offers a three-year course of study emphasizing actual research. The curriculum covers the entire area of the solar system from small bodies to the planets and the Sun. The goal is a broad, interdisciplinary, and solid scientific education, extended with courses in numerical physics, space technology, project management, scientific writing, and presentation techniques. There are always about 50 graduate students studying at the Solar System School. Two thirds are from abroad from over 30 different countries. About 30 percent are women.

== History ==
[[File:Max-Planck-Institute-Solarsystem-Research.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research - April 2006]]
The institute was founded by [[Walter Dieminger]], who was head of the [[Luftwaffe]] test center at [[Rechlin-Lärz Airfield|Rechlin]] at the [[Müritz]] from 1934 onwards. [[Erich Regener]] was cofounder. After being renamed to the "Centre for Radio Transmission" in 1943 and moving to [[Leobersdorf]] in 1944, the institute was united with the [[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer institute]] from [[Freiburg]] at Ried in the Innkreis. After the war an Allied commission decided to move the institute to [[Lindau (Katlenburg-Lindau)|Lindau am Harz]], where buildings of the [[University of Hanover|Technical University of Hanover]] already existed. The convoy arrived on the 2nd and 3 March 1946. During 1948 the radio institute of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute|Kaiser Wilhelm Society]] was transferred from the [[Fraunhofer Society]] to the [[Max Planck Society]] and renamed "Institute for Ionosphere Research" in 1949. In 1950 the US Air Force paid for the construction of an ionospheric echolot system. The full transfer from Fraunhofer to Max Planck Society and the appointment of W. Dieminger as Director followed by the transfer of the Max Planck Institute of Stratosphere Research from Weisenau near Ravensburg to Lindau and another renaming to "Max Planck Institute for Aeronomy" completed the built up.

[[File:Max-Planck-Institute-Solarsystem-Research-2013-Winter.jpg|thumb|300px|Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Lindau, about a year before relocating - March 2013.]]

Erhard Keppler became the science lead in the first German satellite [[Azur (satellite)|Azur]] (in cooperation with NASA) and with him a small group of scientists dedicated to work with satellites was established in Lindau. The institute was selected to build part of the instrumentation of the satellite which was launched in November 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Deutschlands Aufbruch ins All | url = http://www.mpg.de/bilderBerichteDokumente/multimedial/mpForschung/2009/heft04/pdf37.pdf | accessdate = 2010-03-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instruments of the [[Helios probes]] another German NASA cooperation were also built by the institute.

After the retirement of W. Dieminger in 1974 the focus changed from atmospheric research to space research. The Institute participated in a long series of space missions like [[Galileo spacecraft|Galileo]], [[Ulysses probe|Ulysses]], [[Cluster mission|Cluster]], [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]], [[Cassini-Huygens]], [[Rosetta space probe|Rosetta]], [[Mars Express]] [[Venus Express]] and was responsible for most of the camera system of the [[Giotto mission]] to [[Comet Halley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The institute was leading organization in the development, construction and scientific analysis of the [[sunrise (telescope)]]. The telescope is [[solar telescope]] in the [[ultraviolet]], that hangs from a [[high-altitude balloon]]. The five-day maiden flight was conducted in June 2009.

The biggest changes to the Institute resulted from German unification with the retraction of two of the four directors of the institute in 1998 and 2004 after the retirement of Hagfors and Rosenbauer. The institute was renamed "Max Planck Institute of Solar System Research" in 2004 after the last director concerned with [[Ionosphere]] and [[Stratosphere]] research retired. The two remaining groups, of director [[Sami Solanki|S. Solanki]] dedicated to the [[sun]] and [[heliosphere]] and of U. Christensen dedicated to [[planet]]s and [[comet]]s form the present-day Institute.

Since 2004, the institute has published the open access review journal [[Living Reviews in Solar Physics]].

The Max Planck Society decided to move the institute closer to the [[University of Göttingen]]. In 2010, it was planned to relocate it to a new building next to the University's Faculty of Physics by April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.hna.de/nachrichten/landkreis-goettingen/goettingen/millionen-neubau-760543.html | title =Sonnensystem-Forscher ziehen nach Göttingen }}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was completed in February 2014 and the opening ceremony held on 21 May of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research - New building|url=http://www.mps.mpg.de/institute/new-building}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical Geology.&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission on Geological Sciences for Environmental Planning defines medical geology as, "The science dealing with the influence of ordinary environmental factors on the geographical distribution of health problems in man and animals."&lt;ref name="Stones and Health"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dissanayake|first=Chandrasekara|title=Of Stones and Health: Medical Geology in Sri Lanka|journal=Science|date=5 August 2005|volume=309|pages=883–885|doi=10.1126/science.1115174|pmid=16081722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''In its broadest sense, medical geology studies exposure to or deficiency of trace elements and minerals; inhalation of ambient and anthropogenic mineral dusts and volcanic emissions; transportation, modification and concentration of organic compounds; and exposure to radionuclides, microbes and pathogens.''&lt;ref&gt;Finkelman, R.B., Skinner, H. C. W., Plumlee G. S. &amp; Bunnell, J. E. 2001. Medical Geology. Geotimes. http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/nov01/feature_medgeo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Many have deemed medical geology as a new field when in actuality it is re-emerging. [[Hippocrates]] and [[Aristotle]] first recognized the relationship between human diseases and the earth's elements.&lt;ref name="Emerging Discipline"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bunnell|first=Joseph|title=Medical Geology: Emerging Discipline on the Ecosystem--Human Health Interface|journal=EcoHealth|date=March 2004|volume=1|issue=1|pages=15–18|doi=10.1007/s10393-004-0068-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only now are people becoming aware of the effects the environment has on our health. This field ultimately depends on a number of different fields coming and working together to solve some of the earth's mysteries. The scientific term for this field is "hydrobiogeochemoepidemiopathoecology" however it is more commonly known as medical geology.&lt;ref name="Emerging Discipline" /&gt;  It was established in 1990 by the International Union of Geological Sciences.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; [[Paracelsus]], the father of pharmacology (1493-1541) stated that, "All substances are poisons, there is none which is not a poison. The right dosage differentiates a poison and a remedy."&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; This passage sums up the idea of medical geology perfectly. The goal of this field is to find the right balance and intake of elements/ minerals in order to improve and maintain health.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;

Examples of research in medical geology include:

* Studies on the impact of contaminant mobility as a result of [[extreme weather]] events such as [[flooding]].
*[[Lead]] and other [[Heavy metals|heavy metal]] exposure resulting from [[dust]] and other [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]]
*[[Asbestos]] exposure such as [[amphibole]] asbestos dusts in [[Libby, Montana]]
*[[Fungal]] [[infection]] resulting from airborne dust, such as [[Valley Fever]] or [[coccidioidomycosis]]

Recently a new concept of [[geomedical engineering]] has been introduced in medical geology through a paper titled ''"Geomedical Engineering: A new and captivating prospect".''&lt;ref name="Rehman"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rehman A.|date=June 2009|url=http://www.medicalgeology.org/pages/members/publications/newsletters/Newsletter%2014.pdf|title=Geomedical Engineering: A new and captivating prospect}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides the fundamentals of engineering applications to the medical geology issues.
 
==Environment and human health==
It is widely known that the state of our environment affects us in many ways. [[Minerals]] and [[rocks]] are going to have some impact on [[human]] and [[animal]] populations because that is what the [[earth]] is composed of.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;  Medical geology brings professionals from both the [[medicine]] field and the [[geology]] field to help us understand this relationship.&lt;ref name=IMGA&gt;{{cite web|title=International Medical Geology Association|url=http://www.medicalgeology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two priorities that have been established within the medical geology field, "(1) the study of [[trace elements]], especially their [[bioavailability]] and (2) a need to establish baseline, or background levels of [[contaminants]]/ [[xenobiotics]]/ potentially harmful but naturally occurring materials in [[water]], [[soil]], [[air]], [[food]], and [[animal]] tissue." &lt;ref name="Emerging Discipline" /&gt; The elements and minerals in the land effect people and animals immensely especially when there is a close relationship between the two. Those who depend heavily on the land are faced with one of two problems. First, those who live in places such as [[Maputaland]], [[South Africa]] are exposed to heavily impoverished soils which result in a number of diseases caused by [[mineral]] imbalances.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; Secondly, those in areas such as [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]] are often exposed to an excess of [[Chemical element|element]]s in the land resulting in [[mineral]] [[toxicity]].&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; We{{who|date=February 2017}} do of course need some naturally occurring [[Chemical element|element]]s however most can be extremely detrimental to our{{who|date=February 2017}} [[health]].&lt;ref name=Future&gt;{{cite journal|last=Selinus|first=Olle|title=Medical Geology: An Opportunity for the Future|journal=AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment|date=February 2007|volume=36|issue=1|pages=114–116|doi=10.1579/0044-7447(2007)36[114:mgaoft]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a direct link between [[health]] and the [[earth]] because we{{who|date=February 2017}} ingest and breath in all of these chemicals and for the most part we{{who|date=February 2017}} do it unknowingly.&lt;ref name=Future /&gt;

===Sources of Chemicals===
There are many ways in which [[humans]] come into contact with the earth's [[Chemical element|element]]s and below are only a few ways in which we become exposed to them.
*[[Volcanoes]] are one of the main sources that bring all the [[toxicity]] from inside the [[earth]] to the outside.&lt;ref name=Future /&gt; They bring out [[chemicals]] such as; [[arsenic]], [[beryllium]], [[cadmium]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[lead]], [[radon]], and [[uranium]].&lt;ref name="Future"/&gt;
*[[Rocks]] are also one of the leading sources in exposure to these [[Chemical element|element]]s. "They are essentially the source of all the naturally occurring [[chemical element]]s found on the [[earth]]."&lt;ref name="Future"/&gt;

==Diseases==

===Iodine Deficiency===
One of the biggest [[geochemical]] [[diseases]] is [[iodine deficiency]]. Thirty percent of the world is at risk for it and insufficient intake is the most common cause of [[mental retardation]] and [[brain damage]].&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; The [[sea]] is a major source of [[iodine]] and those who are further from it are at a disadvantage.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; Another source of it is in [[soil]], however [[goitrogens]] such as [[humus]] and [[clay]] trap the [[iodine]] making it hard for people to access it.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; Some [[cultures]] actually consume the earth's [[minerals]] by eating [[soil]] and [[clay]]; this is known as geophagy.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; It is most common in the tropics, especially among pregnant women.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; The Ottomac people of [[South America]] engage in this practice and none have suffered from any [[health]] problems related with mineral/ Iodine deficiency.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;

===Cardiovascular Disease===
[[Cardiovascular disease]] has often been linked to [[water]] hardness as the main cause.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; [[Water]] hardness means that there is [[magnesium]] in the [[water]] with [[calcium]] playing a role.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;  Of course some research has completely discredited this evidence, and have found that the more [[magnesium]] in the [[water]] the less chance of death [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;

===Radiation===
Natural [[radiation]] is found everywhere; it is in the [[air]], [[water]], [[soil]], [[rocks]], [[minerals]] and [[food]].&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; The largest amount of [[radiation]] comes from [[radon]].&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; Certain places are called 'high background radiation areas' (HBRAs), such as [[Guarapari]], Southwest of [[France]], [[Ramsar, Mazandaran|Ramsar]], parts of [[China]], and Kerala Coast.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt; People living in these areas however have not shown any [[health]] deficiencies and in some cases are even healthier and live longer than those not in HBRAs.&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;

===Other Issues===
Among the problems presented there are also issues with [[fluoride]] in [[Africa]] and [[India]], [[arsenic]] in [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], and [[Taiwan]], [[selenium]] in areas of the [[United States]], [[Venezuela]], [[China]] and [[nitrate]] in [[agricultural]] areas.&lt;ref name=Book&gt;{{cite book|last=Alloway|first=B.J.|title=Essentials of Medical Geology: Impacts of the Natural Environment on Public Health|year=2005|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|location=Amsterdam, Boston|isbn=0126363412}}&lt;/ref&gt; As medical geology grows it may become more important to the [[medical]] field in the issue of [[diseases]].
In addition to deficiencies of particular minerals, dietary excesses of certain elements occurring in specific geographic regions can also be harmful to human health, as per the examples listed below:
*Hyperkalemia: excess amount of potassium&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;
*Hypercalcemia: excess amount of calcium&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;
*Hyperphosphatemia: excess amount of phosphorus&lt;ref name="Stones and Health" /&gt;

==International Medical Geology Association (IMGA)==
"The International Medical Geology Association aims to provide a network and a forum to bring together the combined expertise of [[geologists]] and earth scientists, environmental scientists, [[toxicologists]], [[epidemiologists]], and [[medical]] specialists, in order to characterize the properties of [[geological]] processes and agents, the dispersal of [[geological]] material and their effects on [[human]] population."&lt;ref name=IMGA /&gt; IMGA was founded in 2006 and manages affairs and funds, plans conferences, elections and publications, and they are also a way of encouraging growth and recognition in the field.&lt;ref name=IMGA /&gt; Although it was founded in 2006, it was a work in progress for ten years when a working group of medical geology was established by the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] (IUGS) in 1996.&lt;ref name=Future /&gt; The goal of the working group was to advertise and make people aware of the harmful effects the environment has on our [[health]].&lt;ref name=Future /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20536">'''Novel ecosystems''' are human-built, modified, or engineered [[ecological niche|niches]] of the [[Anthropocene]]. They exist in places that have been altered in structure and function by human agency. Novel ecosystems are part of the [[human ecology|human]] [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] and [[Ecological niche|niche]] (including [[urban area|urban]], [[suburban]], and [[rural]]), they lack natural analogs, and they have extended an influence that has converted more than three-quarters of wild Earth. These anthropogenic [[biome]]s include technoecosystems that are fuelled by powerful [[energy sources]] (fossil and nuclear) including ecosystems populated with technodiversity, such as roads and unique combinations of soils called [[technosols]]. [[Vegetation association]]s on old buildings or along field boundary stone walls in old agricultural [[landscape]]s are examples of sites where research into novel [[ecosystem ecology]] is developing.

==Overview==

[[Human society]] has transformed the planet to such an extent that we may have ushered in a new epoch known as the ''[[anthropocene]]''. The ecological niche of the anthropocene contains entirely novel ecosystems that include technosols, technodiversity, [[anthrome]]s, and the [[#Technosphere|technosphere]]. These terms describe the human ecological phenomena marking this unique turn in the evolution of Earth's history.&lt;ref name="Odum05"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Odum | first1=E.

Ellis (2008)&lt;ref name="Ellis08" /&gt; identifies twenty-one different kinds of anthropogenic biomes that sort into the following groups: 1) dense settlements, 2) villages, 3) croplands, 4) rangeland, 5) forested, and 6) wildlands. These anthropogenic biomes (or anthromes for short) create the technosphere that surrounds us and are populated with diverse technologies (or technodiversity for short). Within these anthromes the human species (one species out of billions) appropriates 23.8% of the global net primary production. "This is a remarkable impact on the biosphere caused by just one species."

The concept of technoecosystems has been pioneered by ecologists [[Howard T. Odum]] and Zev Naveh. Technoecosystems interface with and are competitive toward natural systems. They have advanced technology (or technodiversity) money-based [[market economies]] and have a large [[ecological footprint]]s.  Technoecosystems have far greater [[energy use|energy requirements]] than natural ecosystems, excessive [[water consumption]], and release [[toxic]] and [[eutrophication|eutrophicating]] chemicals.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Naveh82" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Odum01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Naveh98" /&gt; Other ecologists have defined the extensive [[street network|global network of road system]]s as a type of technoecosystem.&lt;ref name="Lugoa00" /&gt;

===Technoecotypes===
"Bio-agro- and techno-ecotopes are spatially integrated in larger, regional landscape units, but they are not structurally and functionally integrated in the ecosphere. Because of the adverse impacts of the latter and the great human pressures on bio-ecotopes, they are even antagonistically related and therefore cannot function together as a coherent, sustainable ecological system."&lt;ref name="Naveh98" /&gt;{{rp|136}}

'''Performance-Based Building Design''' is an approach to the [[design]] of any complexity of building, from single-detached homes up to and including high-rise apartments and office buildings.  A building constructed in this way is required to meet certain measurable or predictable performance requirements, such as energy efficiency or seismic load, without a specific prescribed method by which to attain those requirements.  This is in contrast to traditional prescribed [[building codes]], which mandate specific [[construction]] practises, such as stud size and distance between studs in [[framing (construction)|wooden frame construction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hsh.k12.nf.ca/technology/cmhc/english/book/appendix/table20/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504062800/http://www.hsh.k12.nf.ca/technology/cmhc/english/book/appendix/table20/index.htm |archivedate=2015-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such an approach provides the freedom to develop tools and methods to evaluate the entire life cycle of the building process, from the business dealings, to [[procurement]], through construction and the evaluation of results.

==Background==
One of the first implementations of performance-based building design requirements was in [[Hammurabi's Code]] (c. 1795 to 1750 BC), where is stated that “a house should not collapse and kill anybody”. This concept is also described in [[Vitruvius]]’s ''“De architectura libri decem”'' (“[[The ten books of architecture|The Ten Books of Architecture]]”) in first century BC.In modern times, the first definition of performance-based building design was introduced in 1965 in France by Blachère with the Agrément system &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cstb.fr/CSTB{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, the building process remained relatively conventional for the next 50 years, based solely on experience and codes, regulations prescribed by [[law]] which stifled [[innovation]]s and change.  The prescription approach is a technical procedure based on past experience which consists of comparing the proposed design with standardized codes, so no [[simulation]] or [[Verification and validation|verification]] tools are needed for the design and building process.

A new approach began to emerge during the second half of the 20th century, when many local building markets began to show that they needed greater flexibility in the procurement procedures to facilitate the exchange of building goods between countries and to improve the speed of procedures and innovations in the building process.  This innovative approach to the procurement, design, contracting, management and maintenance of buildings was '''performance-based building''' (PBBD).

Most recently the clearest definition of performance based building approach was explained in 1982 by the CIB W60 Commission in the report n.64, where Gibson stated that ''“first and foremost, the performance approach is [...]  the practice of thinking and working in terms of ends rather than means.[ …] It is concerned with what a building or building product is required to do, and not with prescribing how it is to be constructed”.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cibworld.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

Many research establishments have studied the implementation of PBBD during the last fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ASTM/CIB/RILEM 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CSTB 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis and Ventre 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Becker and Paciuk 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CIB 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huovila 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  A majority of areas of building design remain open to innovation.

During 1998-2001, the CIB Board and Programme Committee initiated the Proactive Programme on Performance-Based Building&lt;ref&gt;Foliente et al. 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foliente 1998&lt;/ref&gt; in order to practically implement technical developments of performance-based building. This programme was followed by the establishment of the Performance-Based Building &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pebbu.nl&lt;/ref&gt; '''(PeBBu)''', running from October 2001 to October 2005, thanks to funds from the European Commission (EC) [[Fifth Framework Programme]].

The PeBBu Network had a broad and varied programme, a set of activities and produced many papers to aid in the implementation of such vision.

==PeBBu Thematic Network==
PeBBu Thematic Network was managed by the CIB General Secretariat (International Council for Research and Innovation in Building Construction), particularly by the CIB Development Foundation (CIBdf). The PeBBu Network started working in 2001 and completed in 2005.  In the PeBBu Network 73 organisations, included CIBdf (coordinating contractor), BBRI (Belgium), VTT (Finland), CSTB (France), EGM (Netherlands), TNO (Netherlands), BRE (UK), cooperated to this project bringing people together to share their work, their information and knowledge. The objectives of the Network was to stimulate and facilitate international dissemination and implementation of Performance Based Building in building and construction sector, maximising the contribution to this by the international Research and Development community.
The PeBBu Thematic Network result is described and explained in 26 final reports which included three reports with an overall PBB scope, a multitude of research reports from the PeBBu Domains, User Platforms and Regional Platforms, a Final Management report and four practice reports for providing practical support to the actual application of PBB concept in building and [[construction]] sector.

==PBB: Conceptual framework==
A conceptual framework for implementing a PBB market was identified while reviewing various viewpoints during the compilation of the 2nd International State of the Art Report for the PeBBu Thematic Network (Becker and Foliente 2005).
The building facility is a multi-component system with a generally very long life cycle. The system’s design agenda as a whole, and the more specific design objectives of its parts, originate from relevant user requirements. These requirements evolve into a comprehensive set of Performance Requirements that should be established by a large number of [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] (the users, entrepreneur/owner, regulatory framework, design team, and manufacturers).
The main steps in a Performance Based Building Design process are
*# identifying and formulating the relevant User Requirements,
*# transforming the User Requirements identified into Performance Requirements and quantitative performance criteria,
*# using reliable design and evaluation tools to assess whether proposed solutions meet the stated criteria at a satisfactory level.

===Performance concept===
In a Performance-based approach, the focus of all decisions, is on the required performance-in-use and on the evaluations and testing of building asset.
Performance Based Building (PBB) is focused on performance required in use for the business processes and the needs of the users, and then on the evaluations and verification of building assets result. The Performance approach can be used whether the process is about an existing or new assets. It is applicable to the procurement of constructed assets and to any phase of the whole life cycle Building Process, such as [[strategic planning]], [[asset management]], briefing/programming, design and construction, operation and maintenance, management and use, renovations and alterations, codes, regulations and standards.
It includes many topics and criteria, which can be categorized as physical, functional, environmental, financial, economical, psychological, social, facilities, and other more. These criteria are related to singular project, according to the context
and the situation.

===Two key characterisics of performance concept===
Performance concept is based on two key characteristics :
* '''the use of two languages''', one for the clients/users requirements and the other for the supply of the performance;
* '''the need for validation and verification of results''' against performance targets.

====Two languages====
The Performance concept requires two languages: the language of demand requirements and the language of the required performance which should have a capability to fulfill the demand. It is important to recognize that these languages are different.
Szigeti and Davis (Performance Based Building: Conceptual Framework, 2005) explain that  ''“the dialog between client and supplier can be described as two halves of a “hamburger bun”, with the statement of the requirement in functional or performance language (FC - functional concept) matched to a solution (SC - solution concept) in more technical language, and the matching, verification / validation that needs to occur in between”.'' 
    
In a recent paper Ang, Groosman, and Scholten (2005) explain that the functional concept represents the set of unquantified objectives and scopes to be satisfied by the supply solutions, related to performance requirements. The solution concept represents technical realization that satisfies at least the required performance. Design decision is a development of a solution concept.

====Assessing result – match and compare====
Building performance evaluation is the process of systematically comparing  and matching the performance in use of building assets with explicitly documented or implicitly criteria for their expected performance. In the PBB approach is essential matching and comparing demand and supply.  It can be done by using a [[Verification and validation|validation]] method, by measurement, calculation, or testing. Tools and methods are used to permit some form of measurement of testing of the requirements, and the relating measurement of the capability of assets to perform.

There are many types of in-depth specialized technical evaluations and audits. These validations generally require time, a major effort by the customer group, and a high level of funding. Normally, the most valuable methods and tools are comprehensive scans which are performance based and include metrics that can easily be measured without lab-type instruments.
Evaluations and reviews, are integral  part of asset and portfolio management, design, construction, commissioning.
Evaluations can be used for different purposes, depending on the requirements being considered, for example they could be used in support of funding decisions, they could include a condition assessment to ensure that the level of degradation or the obsolescence is known, they could include an assessment of the utilization or  an assessment of the capability of the product result to perform functional expected requirements. Such evaluations can be used at any time during the life cycle of the asset.
PBB evaluations should be done in a routine manner, really the evaluations are often done only as part of Commissioning or shortly thereafter, or when there is a problem.

There are two different kinds of performance verifications. Performance evaluations  rate
the physical asset according to a set of existing criteria and indicators of capability, and match the results against the required levels of performance. The Occupant Satisfaction Surveys record the perceptions of the users, usually through a scale of satisfaction measurements. Both types of evaluations complement each other.
* '''Tools'''
Innovative decision-support methodologies are taking place in building sector. There are some tools explicitly based on the demand and supply concepts and other ones which employ standardized performance metrics that for the first time link facility
condition to the functional requirements of organizations and their customers. Projects can be planned, prioritize, and budgeted using a multi-criteria approach, that is transparent, comprehensive and auditable.
One of the methodologies that can be used is a '''gap analysis''' based on calibrated scales that measure both the levels of requirements and the capability of the asset that is either already used, or being designed, or offer to be bought, or leased. Such methodology is an ASTM and American National (ANSI) standard and is currently being considered as an ISO standard.
It is particularly useful when the information about the “gap”, if any, can be presented in support of funding decisions and actions.

There are a large number of  verification methodologies, (e.g. POEs, CRE-FM), and all of these need to refer back to explicit statements of requirements to be able to compare with expected performance.
To evaluate the result of a building asset against the expected performance requirements it is necessary to fix some tools used during the process.  These tools are the reference of whole life cycle building process, so organizations use '''‘key performance indicators (KPI)’'''  to prove that they are meeting the targets that have been set by senior management. At the same time performance measurement (PM) becomes central to managing organizations, their operations and logistic support.
These methodologies include the feedback loop that links a facility in use to the requirements and capabilities that are compared and matched whenever decisions are needed.

===Performance approach and prescriptive approach===
A prescriptive approach describes the way a building asset must be constructed, rather than the end result of the building process, and is related to the type and quality of materials used, the method of construction, and the workmanship, etc.
This type of approach is strictly mandated by a combination of law, codes, standards, and regulations, etc., and is based on past experience and consolidated know-how. The content of prescriptive codes and standards is usually a consequence of an accident causing injury or death which requires a remedy to avoid a repeat, as a consequence of some hazardous situation, or as a consequence of some recognized social need. In many countries, in both the public and private sector, research is taking place into a different set of codes, methods and tools based on performance criteria to complement the traditional prescriptive codes.
In the 1970s, this search produced the '''“Nordic Model”''' (NKB 1978), which constituted the reference model of  next performance-based codes. This model links easily to one of the key characteristics of the Performance approach, the dialog between the WHY, the WHAT and the HOW.

Using a Performance Based approach does not preclude the use of prescriptive specifications. Although the benefits of the adopting of a PBBD approach are significant, it is recognized that employing a performance-based approach at any stage in the building process is more complex and expensive than using the simpler prescriptive route. So, the application of this approach should not be regarded as an end in itself. When simple building are concerned or well proven technologies are used, the use of prescriptive codes results more effective, efficient, faster, or less costly, so prescriptive specifications will continue to be useful in many situations.

At the same time for the complex projects use of the performance based route at every stage is indispensable, in particular during design and evaluation phases.

It is not likely that a facility will be planned, procured, delivered, maintained, used and renovated using solely Performance Based documents at each step of the way, down the supply chain, to the procurement of products and materials, because there is not yet enough experience with the Performance Based Building approach. At the same time the prescriptive approach can bring to stifle changes and innovations, so best way to set building process is blending both different approaches.

==Statements of Requirements (SoR)==
The Statements of Requirements represents a reference for the whole life cycle management of facilities, they are the core of the conceptual framework came up from the PeBBu Thematic Network. They constitute the key to implementation of the PBB in the construction sector.

The SoRs is a document prepared by clients, or in the verbal statements communicated to supplies, it is based on the user functional needs. These user requirements are converted into performance requirements, which can be explicit or implicit. Such document should include information about what is essential to the client. SoRs will take different forms depending on the kind of client and what is being procured, at what phase of the Life Cycle or where in the supply chain a document is being used.
The SoRs should be, dynamic, not static, and should include more and more details as projects proceed. This document should be prepared at different levels of granularity, how detailed the documentation is at each stage depends on the complexity of the project and on the procurement route chosen for the project.

The SoRs represent a very important part of a continuous process of communication between clients (demand) and their project team (supply), they will be updated and managed using computerized tools and will contain all requirements throughout the life of the facility. This process is called “briefing” in UK and Commonwealth English, and “programming” in American English. An SoR is normally prepared for any project, whether it is a PBB project or not. Assembling such a document usually leads to a more appropriate match between the needs of clients and users and the constructed assets.
Statements of Requirements have to be very carefully stated so that it is easy to verify that a proposed solution can meet those requirements.

High level statement of requirements need to be paired with indicators of capability so design solutions can be evaluated before they are built in order to avoid mistakes. In the SoRs it is important to take into account some design aspect like flexibility indicators because constructed assets need for change during their life cycle, uses and activities can change very rapidly, so it is essential to test different solutions way that the spaces might be used according to anticipate changes.
SoRs, as understood in ISO 9000, include not only what the client requires and is prepared to pay for, but also the process and indicators that will provide the means to verify, and validate, that the product or service delivered meets those stated requirements.

As part of the worldwide movement to implement a PBB approach and to develop tools that will make it easier to shift to PBB, the [http://www.iai-tech.org International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI)] set up projects to map the processes that are part of Whole Life Cycle Management as ''Portfolio and Asset Management: Performance (PAMPeR) and Early Design” (ED).''
The IAI efforts are complemented by many other efforts to create standards for the information to be captured and analyzed to verify performance-in-use.

==Performance requirements (PR)==
Performance requirements translate user requirements in more precise quantitative measurable and technical terms, usually for a specific purpose.

Supply team prepares a document that includes, objectives and goals, performance requirements and criteria. It is important to include “indicators of performance” in the way that it can be measured the results against explicit requirements, whether qualitative or quantitative. Performance indicators need to be easily understood by the users and the evaluators. To validate the indicators and verify that required performance-in-use has been achieved it is necessary using appropriate methods and tools.
Levels of performance requirements can be stated as part of the preparation of SoRs, as part of project programs, or as part of requests for proposals and procurement contracts.
It is preferable adopting a flexible approach to the expression and comparison of performance levels, so required and achieved performance can be expressed not as single values but as bands between upper and lower limits. In consequence, in performance terms the criteria can be expressed as graduated scales, divided into broad bands.

==Performance based codes==
In the building and construction industry, until 25–30 years old, prescriptive codes, regulations and standards  made innovation and change difficult and costly to implement, and created technical restrictions to trade. These concerns have been the major drivers towards the use of a Performance Based approach to codes, regulations and standards. Performance-based building regulations have been implemented or are being developed in many countries but they have not yet reached their full potential. In part, this can be attributed to the fact that the overall regulatory system has not yet been fully addressed, and gaps exist in several key areas.
Bringing the regulatory and non-regulatory models together is probably the best way to work. This is shown in the '''“Total Performance System Models”''' diagram (Meacham, et al. 2002), that maps the flow of decision making from society and business objectives to construction solutions.

The difference between the regulatory and non-regulatory parts of the Total Performance System Models is that the first one is mandated by codes and regulations based on the law, while those other functional requirements, included in Statements of Requirements, are an integral part of what the client requires and is willing to pay for.
* '''Consequences relating to procedure'''
For procurements in the public sector and for publicly traded corporations, it’s important that the decisions and choices are transparent and explicit, regardless of the specific procurement route. All procurement processes can be either Prescriptive or Performance Based. Design-Build, Public Private Partnerships (PPP), [[private finance initiative]] (PFI) and similar procurement procedures are particularly suited to the use of a strong Performance Based Building application. If the expected performance are not stated explicitly and verifiably then these procurement methods will likely be more subject to disappointments and legal problems.
To get the benefits from these procurement approaches, it is essential to organize the services of the supply chain in order to get innovative, less costly, or better solutions by shifting decisions about “how” to the integrated team.

==Future scenarios==
Although the effort of a large number of research establishments in order to implement and diffuse the PBBD approach, it is difficult to innovate the practice of working and thinking in building sector. The positive trend is that more and more interest in this approach is happening around the world. Many countries tried to reform the way that building and construction is regulated and managed.

The core of implementation of PBB approach is that the clients, the users really know and understand why and what they require and that they can state easily and clearly their SoRs document. It is also important that the client is active, involved, informed and able to understand and choose best way for its interest, whether he’s a private or a public client, a big or a little structure, whether the  asset is for its own use or for use by others.

Procurement will be the key to improve performance approach when clients learn to be more explicit in their demands and to participate more aggressively in the management and delivery process of their most significant investment and resource.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1647">'''Personal and Social Education (PSE)''' is a component of the [[state school]] [[curriculum]] in [[Wales]]. PSE became a statutory requirement in schools in September 2003, and is compulsory for all [[student]]s at [[Key Stage]]s 1, 2, 3 and 4 (5 to 16 years old), and shares some similar elements with [[Personal, Social and Health Education]] and [[Citizenship|citizenship education]] in [[England]]. These include:
* local and global [[community|communities]]
* [[sex education]]
* [[spirituality]]
* [[morals]]
* [[Environmentalism|environmental issues]]

==The PSE Framework==
For each Key Stage, learning outcomes for Knowledge &amp; Understanding are set in each of the Aspects (listed below); additionally, learning outcomes for the development of Attitudes &amp; Values and Skills are prescribed across all Aspects. [[ACCAC]], the curriculum authority for Wales (part of the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] from 1 April 2006), published these in the [[Personal and Social Education Framework|PSE Framework]] (2000). While it is not compulsory for schools to use the Framework, they are expected to use [[scheme of work|schemes of work]] in order to standardize practice across [[teacher]]s and [[Class (education)|class]]es.

Aspects:

* Community
* Emotional
* Environmental
* Learning
* Moral
* Physical
* Sexual
* Social
* Spiritual
* Vocational

A '''plant genome assembly''' represents the complete [[genome|genomic sequence]] of a [[plant]] species, which is assembled into [[chromosome]]s and other [[organelle]]s by using [[DNA]] (deoxyribonucleic acid) fragments that are obtained from different types of [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] technology.

==  Assembly strategies ==
In general, for sequencing and assembling large and complex genomes like plants, different strategies are used, based on the technologies available at that time when the project started.

=== Sanger clone-by-clone ===
Clone-by-clone sequencing strategies are based on the construction of a [[Gene map|map]] for each chromosome before the sequencing, and rely on libraries made from large-insert clones. The most common type of large-insert clone is the [[bacterial artificial chromosome]] (BAC).

With BAC, the genome is first split into smaller pieces with the location recorded. The pieces of DNA are then inserted into BAC clones that are further multiplied by inserting them into bacterial cells that grow very fast. These pieces are further fragmented into overlapping smaller pieces that are placed into a vector and then sequenced. The small pieces are then assembled into contigs by overlapping them. Next, using the map from the first step the contigs are assembled back into the chromosomes.

The first complete plant genome assembly (also the first plant genome published) that used this type of technique was Arabidopsis thaliana,in 2000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Different large-insert libraries like BACs, [[P1 artificial chromosomes]] (PAC), [[yeast artificial chromosome]] (YAC) and [[transformation-competent artificial chromosomes]] (TACs) were combined to assemble the genome. From clones with [[restriction fragment fingerprint]], by comparison of the patterns and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] or [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) the [[Physical map (genetics)|physical maps]] were constructed. The physical maps were integrated together with [[genetic maps]] to identify [[contig]] positions and orientations. End sequences from 47,788 BAC clones were used to extend contigs from anchored BACs and to select a minimum tiling path. A total of 1,569 clones found in minimum tiling path were selected and sequenced. Direct PCR products were used to clone remaining gaps, and YACs allowed the characterization of [[telomere]] sequences. The resulting sequenced regions were 115.4 Mb of the 125 Mb predicted size of the genome and a total of 25,498 of protein-coding genes.

To sequence and assemble the genome of Oryza Sativa (japonica),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the same strategy was used. For Oryza Sativa a total of 3,401 mapped clones in a minimum tiling path were selected from the physical map and assembled.

One of the most important crops in the world, maize (Zea mays), is the last plant genome project primarily based on Sanger BAC-by-BAC strategy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The genome size of Maize, 2.3 Gb and 10 chromosomes,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schnable PS, Ware D, Fulton RS, Stein JC, Wei F, Pasternak S, Liang C, Zhang J, Fulton L, Graves TA, Minx P, Reily AD, Courtney L, Kruchowski SS, Tomlinson C, Strong C, Delehaunty K, Fronick C, Courtney B, Rock SM, Belter E, Du F, Kim K, Abbott RM, Cotton M, Levy A, Marchetto P, Ochoa K, Jackson SM, Gillam B, Chen W, Yan L, Higginbotham J, Cardenas M, Waligorski J, Applebaum E, Phelps L, Falcone J, Kanchi K, Thane T, Scimone A, Thane N, Henke J, Wang T, Ruppert J, Shah N, Rotter K, Hodges J, Ingenthron E, Cordes M, Kohlberg S, Sgro J, Delgado B, Mead K, Chinwalla A, Leonard S, Crouse K, Collura K, Kudrna D, Currie J, He R, Angelova A, Rajasekar S, Mueller T, Lomeli R, Scara G, Ko A, Delaney K, Wissotski M, Lopez G, Campos D, Braidotti M, Ashley E, Golser W, Kim H, Lee S, Lin J, Dujmic Z, Kim W, Talag J, Zuccolo A, Fan C, Sebastian A, Kramer M, Spiegel L, Nascimento L, Zutavern T, Miller B, Ambroise C, Muller S, Spooner W, Narechania A, Ren L, Wei S, Kumari S, Faga B, Levy MJ, McMahan L, Van Buren P, Vaughn MW, Ying K, Yeh CT, Emrich SJ, Jia Y, Kalyanaraman A, Hsia AP, Barbazuk WB, Baucom RS, Brutnell TP, Carpita NC, Chaparro C, Chia JM, Deragon JM, Estill JC, Fu Y, Jeddeloh JA, Han Y, Lee H, Li P, Lisch DR, Liu S, Liu Z, Nagel DH, McCann MC, SanMiguel P, Myers AM, Nettleton D, Nguyen J, Penning BW, Ponnala L, Schneider KL, Schwartz DC, Sharma A, Soderlund C, Springer NM, Sun Q, Wang H, Waterman M, Westerman R, Wolfgruber TK, Yang L, Yu Y, Zhang L, Zhou S, Zhu Q, Bennetzen JL, Dawe RK, Jiang J, Jiang N, Presting GG, Wessler SR, Aluru S, Martienssen RA, Clifton SW, McCombie WR, Wing RA, Wilson RK | display-authors = 6 | title = The B73 maize genome: complexity, diversity, and dynamics | journal = Science | volume = 326 | issue = 5956 | pages = 1112–5 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19965430 | doi = 10.1126/science.1178534 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is significantly larger than that of rice and Arabidopsis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; To assemble the genome of maize a set of 16,848 minimally overlapping BAC clones derived

Sanger clone-by-clone strategy has the advantage of working in small units, which reduces the complexity and computational requirements, as well as minimized problems associated with the misassembly of highly repetitive DNA and therefore is an attractive solution in assembling plant genomes and other complex eukaryotic genomes. The main disadvantages of this method are the costs and the resources required.

=== Sanger whole-genome shotgun (WGS) ===
In the [[Whole genome sequencing|WGS]] sequencing technology there is no order for the fragments that are sequenced. The DNA is randomly sheared and cloned fragments are sequenced and assembled using computational methods. This technology reduced the cost and the time associated with construction of the maps and relies on computational resources.

The draft genome of grapevine&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; is the fourth genome published for a flowering plant and the first from a fruit crop. The sequences of the genome were obtained from different types of libraries, like plasmids, fosmids and BACs. All the data were generated by paired-end sequencing of cloned insert using Sanger technology on ABI3730x1 sequencers. To assemble the reads, Arachne, 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swan KA, Curtis DE, McKusick KB, Voinov AV, Mapa FA, Cancilla MR | title = High-throughput gene mapping in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Genome Research | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 1100–5 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12097347 | pmc = 186621 | doi = 10.1101/gr.208902 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a software designed to analyze reads obtained from both ends of plasmid clones, was used. In total 6.2 million paired-end tag reads were produced. The software produced 20.784 contigs that were combined into 3,830 supercontigs, having an [[N50, L50, and related statistics|N50]] value of 64kb. Supercontigs had a total size of 498 Mb.

The anchorage of the supercontigs along the genome was performed first by joining supercontigs together using paired BAC end sequences. The resulting ultracontigs and the remained supercontigs were then aligned along the genetic map of the genome.

=== Next-generation sequencing ===
Due to its relatively cheap cost in comparison to previous methods, most of the recent plant genomes were sequenced and assembled using data from NGS (next-generation- sequencing) technology. In general the NGS data are used in combination with Sanger Sequencing technology or long-reads obtained from the [[Third-generation sequencing|third generation sequencing]].
The genome of the [[cucumber]], (Cucumis sativus),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huang S, Li R, Zhang Z, Li L, Gu X, Fan W, Lucas WJ, Wang X, Xie B, Ni P, Ren Y, Zhu H, Li J, Lin K, Jin W, Fei Z, Li G, Staub J, Kilian A, van der Vossen EA, Wu Y, Guo J, He J, Jia Z, Ren Y, Tian G, Lu Y, Ruan J, Qian W, Wang M, Huang Q, Li B, Xuan Z, Cao J, Wu Z, Zhang J, Cai Q, Bai Y, Zhao B, Han Y, Li Y, Li X, Wang S, Shi Q, Liu S, Cho WK, Kim JY, Xu Y, Heller-Uszynska K, Miao H, Cheng Z, Zhang S, Wu J, Yang Y, Kang H, Li M, Liang H, Ren X, Shi Z, Wen M, Jian M, Yang H, Zhang G, Yang Z, Chen R, Liu S, Li J, Ma L, Liu H, Zhou Y, Zhao J, Fang X, Li G, Fang L, Li Y, Liu D, Zheng H, Zhang Y, Qin N, Li Z, Yang G, Yang S, Bolund L, Kristiansen K, Zheng H, Li S, Zhang X, Yang H, Wang J, Sun R, Zhang B, Jiang S, Wang J, Du Y, Li S | display-authors = 6 | title = The genome of the cucumber, Cucumis sativus L | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 41 | issue = 12 | pages = 1275–81 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19881527 | doi = 10.1038/ng.475 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the plant genomes that used the NGS [[Illumina dye sequencing|Illumina]] reads in combination with Sanger sequences. 72.2-fold genome coverage high quality base pairs were generated from which 3.9-fold coverage was provided from Sanger and the Illumina GA reads provided 68.3-fold coverage. From this two assemblies were produced based on the sequencing technology. The resulting contigs were compared between them, resulting in a total length of the assembled genome of 243.5 Mb. The result is about 30% smaller than the genome size estimated by [[flow cytometry]] of isolated nuclei stained with [[propidium iodide]] (367 Mb). A genetic map was constructed to anchor the assembled genome. 72.8% of the assembled sequences were successfully anchored onto the seven chromosomes.
Another plant genome that combined NGS with Sanger sequencing was the genome of [[Theobroma cacao]], 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Argout X, Salse J, Aury JM, Guiltinan MJ, Droc G, Gouzy J, Allegre M, Chaparro C, Legavre T, Maximova SN, Abrouk M, Murat F, Fouet O, Poulain J, Ruiz M, Roguet Y, Rodier-Goud M, Barbosa-Neto JF, Sabot F, Kudrna D, Ammiraju JS, Schuster SC, Carlson JE, Sallet E, Schiex T, Dievart A, Kramer M, Gelley L, Shi Z, Bérard A, Viot C, Boccara M, Risterucci AM, Guignon V, Sabau X, Axtell MJ, Ma Z, Zhang Y, Brown S, Bourge M, Golser W, Song X, Clement D, Rivallan R, Tahi M, Akaza JM, Pitollat B, Gramacho K, D'Hont A, Brunel D, Infante D, Kebe I, Costet P, Wing R, McCombie WR, Guiderdoni E, Quetier F, Panaud O, Wincker P, Bocs S, Lanaud C | display-authors = 6 | title = The genome of Theobroma cacao | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 101–8 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21186351 | doi = 10.1038/ng.736 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an economically important tropical fruit tree crop. The genome was sequenced in a consortium, “The International Cocoa Genome Sequencing consortium (ICGS) “ and produced a total of 17.6 million 454 single end reads, 8.8 million 454 paired-end reads, 398.0 million Illumina paired-end reads and about 88,000 Sanger BAC reads. First by using genome assembly software, Newbler, an assembly was produced with 25,912 contigs and 4,792 scaffolds from the reads obtained from Roche/454 and Sanger raw data. This had a total length of 326.9 Mb, which represents 76% of the estimated genome size.
The Illumina reads were used to complement the [[454 Sequencing|454]] assembly, by aligning the short reads on the cocoa genome assembly using the SOAP software.
A similar strategy that combined NGS reads and Sanger Sequencing was used for other important plant species like the first published apple genome ([[Apple|Malus domestica]]),&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Velasco R, Zharkikh A, Affourtit J, Dhingra A, Cestaro A, Kalyanaraman A, Fontana P, Bhatnagar SK, Troggio M, Pruss D, Salvi S, Pindo M, Baldi P, Castelletti S, Cavaiuolo M, Coppola G, Costa F, Cova V, Dal Ri A, Goremykin V, Komjanc M, Longhi S, Magnago P, Malacarne G, Malnoy M, Micheletti D, Moretto M, Perazzolli M, Si-Ammour A, Vezzulli S, Zini E, Eldredge G, Fitzgerald LM, Gutin N, Lanchbury J, Macalma T, Mitchell JT, Reid J, Wardell B, Kodira C, Chen Z, Desany B, Niazi F, Palmer M, Koepke T, Jiwan D, Schaeffer S, Krishnan V, Wu C, Chu VT, King ST, Vick J, Tao Q, Mraz A, Stormo A, Stormo K, Bogden R, Ederle D, Stella A, Vecchietti A, Kater MM, Masiero S, Lasserre P, Lespinasse Y, Allan AC, Bus V, Chagné D, Crowhurst RN, Gleave AP, Lavezzo E, Fawcett JA, Proost S, Rouzé P, Sterck L, Toppo S, Lazzari B, Hellens RP, Durel CE, Gutin A, Bumgarner RE, Gardiner SE, Skolnick M, Egholm M, Van de Peer Y, Salamini F, Viola R | display-authors = 6 | title = The genome of the domesticated apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.) | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 42 | issue = 10 | pages = 833–9 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20802477 | doi = 10.1038/ng.654 }}&lt;/ref&gt; cotton ([[Gossypium raimondii|Gossypium Raimond]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang K, Wang Z, Li F, Ye W, Wang J, Song G, Yue Z, Cong L, Shang H, Zhu S, Zou C, Li Q, Yuan Y, Lu C, Wei H, Gou C, Zheng Z, Yin Y, Zhang X, Liu K, Wang B, Song C, Shi N, Kohel RJ, Percy RG, Yu JZ, Zhu YX, Wang J, Yu S | display-authors = 6 | title = The draft genome of a diploid cotton Gossypium raimondii | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 44 | issue = 10 | pages = 1098–103 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22922876 | doi = 10.1038/ng.2371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; draft genome of sweet orange ([[Citrus × sinensis|Citrus sinensis]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xu Q, Chen LL, Ruan X, Chen D, Zhu A, Chen C, Bertrand D, Jiao WB, Hao BH, Lyon MP, Chen J, Gao S, Xing F, Lan H, Chang JW, Ge X, Lei Y, Hu Q, Miao Y, Wang L, Xiao S, Biswas MK, Zeng W, Guo F, Cao H, Yang X, Xu XW, Cheng YJ, Xu J, Liu JH, Luo OJ, Tang Z, Guo WW, Kuang H, Zhang HY, Roose ML, Nagarajan N, Deng XX, Ruan Y | display-authors = 6 | title = The draft genome of sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 45 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–66 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23179022 | doi = 10.1038/ng.2472 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the domesticated tomato ([[Tomato|Solanum lycopersicum]]) genome&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tomato Genome Consortium | title = The tomato genome sequence provides insights into fleshy fruit evolution | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7400 | pages = 635–41 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22660326 | pmc = 3378239 | doi = 10.1038/nature11119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third-generation ===
With the emergence of [[third-generation sequencing]] (TGS) some of the limitations from previous methods of sequencing and assembling plant genomes have started to be addressed. This technology is characterized by the parallel sequencing of single molecules of DNA, that results in sequences up to 54 kbp length ([[Pacific Biosciences|PacBio]] RS 2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bleidorn|first=Christoph| name-list-format = vanc |date=2015|title=Third generation sequencing: technology and its potential impact on evolutionary biodiversity research |journal=Systematics and Biodiversity|volume=|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, long reads from TGS have relatively high error rates (~10% on average)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Hayan|last2=Gurtowski|first2=James|last3=Yoo|first3=Shinjae|last4=Nattestad|first4=Maria|last5=Marcus|first5=Shoshana|last6=Goodwin|first6=Sara|last7=McCombie|first7=W.

The price of such technology is still quite high and therefore is generally used in combination with short reads from NGS.
One of the first plant genome that used long-reads from TGS, Pacific Biosciences in combination with short reads from NGS was the genome of [[Spinach]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Deynze A | date = 2015 |title=Using spinach to compare technologies for whole genome assemblies |journal=Plant &amp; Animal Genomics XXIII Conference|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; having a genome size estimated at 989 Mb. For this, a 60× coverage of the genome was generated, with 20% of the reads larger than 20 kb. Data were assembled using PacBio’s hierarchical genome assembly process (HGAP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chin CS, Alexander DH, Marks P, Klammer AA, Drake J, Heiner C, Clum A, Copeland A, Huddleston J, Eichler EE, Turner SW, Korlach J | title = Nonhybrid, finished microbial genome assemblies from long-read SMRT sequencing data | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 563–9 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23644548 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2474 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and showed that long-read assemblies revealed a 63-fold improvement in contig size over an Illumina-only assembly.
Another plant genome that was recently published that used long reads in combination with short reads is the improved assembly of the apple genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Daccord N, Celton JM, Linsmith G, Becker C, Choisne N, Schijlen E, van de Geest H, Bianco L, Micheletti D, Velasco R, Di Pierro EA, Gouzy J, Rees DJ, Guérif P, Muranty H, Durel CE, Laurens F, Lespinasse Y, Gaillard S, Aubourg S, Quesneville H, Weigel D, van de Weg E, Troggio M, Bucher E | display-authors = 6 | title = High-quality de novo assembly of the apple genome and methylome dynamics of early fruit development | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 49 | issue = 7 | pages = 1099–1106 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28581499 | doi = 10.1038/ng.3886 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this project a hybrid approach was used, combining different data types from sequencing technologies. The sequences used came from: PacBio RS II, Illumina paired-end reads (PE) and Illumina mate- pair reads (MP). As a first step an assembly from Illumina paired-end reads was performed using a well-known de novo assembly software SOAPdevo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luo|first=Ruibang | name-list-format = vanc |date=2012|title=SOAPdenovo2: an empirically improved memory-efficient short-read de novo assembler |journal=Gigascience|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then using a hybrid assembly pipeline DBG2OLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ye C, Hill CM, Wu S, Ruan J, Ma ZS | title = DBG2OLC: Efficient Assembly of Large Genomes Using Long Erroneous Reads of the Third Generation Sequencing Technologies | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 31900 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27573208 | pmc = 5004134 | doi = 10.1038/srep31900 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the contigs obtained at the first step and the long reads from PacBio were combined. The assembly was then polished with the help of Illumina paired-end reads by mapping them to the contigs using BWA-MEM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Heng | name-list-format = vanc |date=2013|title=Aligning sequence reads, clone sequences and assembly contigs with BWA- MEM |journal=Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT }}&lt;/ref&gt; By mapping the mate-pair reads on the corrected contigs they scaffold the assembly. Further BioNano (https://bionanogenomics.com/) optical mapping analysis with a total length of 649.7 Mb, were used in the hybrid assembly pipeline together with the scaffolds obtained from the previous step. The resulting scaffolds were anchored to a genetic map constructed from 15,417 single-nucleotide [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] (SNPs) markers. For better understanding of the number and diversity of genes that were identified, ribonucleic acid RNA-seq, were used.
The resulted genome has a dimension of 643.2 Mb getting closer to the estimated genome size than the previous published assembly&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and a smaller number of protein-coding- genes.

The use of long reads in the plant genome assemblies became more popular, for reducing the number of scaffolds and increasing the quality of the genome by improving the assembly and coverage in regions that are not clearly defined by NGS assembly.

'''Polymer fume fever''' or '''fluoropolymer fever''', also informally called '''Teflon flu''', is an inhalation fever caused by the fumes released when [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE, known under the trade name [[Teflon]]) reaches temperatures of 300&amp;nbsp;°C (572&amp;nbsp;°F) to 450&amp;nbsp;°C (842&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shusterman|first=D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1164">In [[manufacturing engineering]], a '''product layout''' refers to a production system where the work stations and equipment are located along the line of production, as with [[assembly line]]s.

Usually, work units are moved along a line (not necessarily a [[Line (geometry)|geometric line]], but a set of interconnected work stations) by a [[conveyor]]. [[Work (project management)|Work]] is done in small amounts at each of the work stations on the line. To use the product layout, the total work to be performed must be dividable into small [[Task (project management)|tasks]] that can be assigned to each of the workstations.

Because the work stations each do small amounts of [[Work (project management)|work]], the stations utilize specific techniques and equipment tailored to the individual job they are assigned.  This can lead to a higher rate of production.

In the field of [[computer graphics]], '''Sequential Euclidean Distance Transforms (SEDT)''' are a special kind of [[distance transform]]s based on the [[Euclidean distance|Euclidean]] [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] which use [[multi-valued]] [[coordinate vector|vector]] elements to propagate distances.

This central thesis may be argued from a theistic perspective, but is also argued to defend positions of [[agnosticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skeptical-theism/|title=Skeptical theism|last=|first=|date=25 January 2014|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=13 October 2016|quote=Alston is not quite as explicit, but seems to agree.

One argument is based on analogy, likening our understanding of God's motives to those of a child grasping a parent's reasons for seeking painful medical treatment, for example.  Other approaches are the limitations on the human ability to understand the moral realm, and appeals to epistemic factors such as sensitivity or contextual requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/sceptical-theism/v-1|title=Skeptical Theism|last=McBrayer|first=Justin|date=2015|website=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|doi=10.4324/9780415249126-K3583-1|access-date=13 October 2016|quote=Contemporary philosophers have further refined sceptical theism into a family of related views, each with a different defence. These defences include appeals to analogies (for example the parent/child relationship), appeals to the limitations of our grasp of the moral realm and appeals to epistemic requirements (for example sensitivity requirements or contextual requirements).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the philosophy of religion, skeptical theism is not a broad skepticism toward human knowledge of God, but is instead putatively presented as a response to philosophical propositions, such as those focused on drawing "all things considered" inductive conclusions about God's motives from perceived circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/skept-th/|title=Skeptical Theism|last=McBrayer|first=Justin P.|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=|quote=It is important to get clear on the scope of the skepticism endorsed by skeptical theists.  First, it is not a global skepticism—skeptical theists are not committed to the view that we cannot know anything at all.  Instead, the skepticism is (putatively) limited to a narrow range of propositions, namely those having to do with God’s reasons for action.  For example, a skeptical theist could admit that humans have ceteris paribus knowledge of God’s reasons for actions.  An example of such knowledge might be the following: other-things-being-equal, God will eliminate suffering when he is able to do so.  However, knowing this latter claim is consistent with denying that we know the following: God will eliminate this particular instance of suffering.  Holding the combination of these two views is possible for the following reason: while we might know that other-things-being-equal, God will eliminate suffering when he is able to do so, we might not know whether or not other things are equal in any particular instance of suffering.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, skeptical theism is not a position used to defend all forms of theism, though it is most often presented in the defense of orthodox Christian theism. Moreover, skeptical theism is not supported by all theists and some who support its skeptical positions are not theists.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/skept-th/|title=Skeptical Theism|last=McBrayer|first=Justine|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=9 October 2016|quote=Not all theists are skeptical theists, and not all of the philosophers who endorse the skeptical component of skeptical theism are theists.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is because skeptical theism provides a reason to be skeptical of a crucial premise in the argument from evil, namely the premise that asserts that at least some of the evils in our world are gratuitous.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also presented in response to other atheological arguments claiming to know God's purposes based on circumstances, such as the [[Argument from nonbelief|argument from divine hiddenness]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/sceptical-theism/v-1|title=Sceptical theism|last=McBrayer|first=Justin|date=2015|website=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=10 October 2016|quote=The sceptical element of sceptical theism can be used to undermine various arguments for atheism including both the argument from evil and the argument from divine hiddenness.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
'''Argument from evil''' is an atheological argument asserting that some evils in the world are pointless or gratuitous evils representing evidence against the existence of the orthodox Christian God.

'''Atheological''' is the atheistic equivalent to the word theological.

'''God''' (capitalized), for the purposes of skeptical theism is the [[Omniscience|omniscient]] (all knowing), [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] (all good)  and [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]] (all powerful) God of orthodox Christianity.

'''Gratuitous evil''' is evil permitted to occur in the word, but for which God is argued to have no morally sufficient reason for permitting. It is also sometimes called 'pointless evil' or 'inscrutable evil'.

'''Noseeum Inference''' is a philosophical term describing the position asserting that an atheologian's inability to think of a justification for God to permit an evil means it is likely that there is no possible reason.

'''[[Theodicy|Theodicies]]''', are theological positions seeking to fully reconcile apparent [[evil]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in the world with the existence of the Christian God.

== Draper's Skeptical Theism ==
In the philosophy of religion, skeptical theism is the position that we should be skeptical of our ability to assess God's motivations or lack of motivation from our perceptions of the circumstances we observe in the world. As originally proposed by the agnostic Purdue Philosopher [[Paul Draper (philosopher)|Paul Draper]] the position argues that human cognitive faculties should be insufficient to permit drawing inductive inferences concerning God's reasons or lack of reasons for permitting perceived evils.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/sceptical-theism/v-1|title=Sceptical Theism|last=McBrayer|first=Justin|date=2015|website=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|doi=10.4324/9780415249126-K3583-1|access-date=10 October 2016|quote=According to sceptical theists, the human mind is limited in such a way that it would not at all be surprising that God would have reasons that are beyond our understanding for allowing the evils of our world.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position is often argued, seeking to undercut a key premise in the [[argument from evil|evidential argument from evi]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skeptical-theism/|title=Skeptical Theism|last=|first=|date=25 January 2014|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/evil-evi/|title=The Evidential Problem of Evil|last=|first=|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=11 October 2016|quote=Evidential arguments from evil attempt to show that, once we put aside any evidence there might be in support of the existence of God, it becomes unlikely, if not highly unlikely, that the world was created and is governed by an omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good being.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The evidential argument from evil ==
The evidential argument from evil asserts that the amount, types, or distribution of evils, provide an evidential basis for concluding that God's existence is improbable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/evil-evi/#H2|title=Evidential Problem of Evil|last=|first=|date=|website=Internet encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The argument has a number of formulation, but can be stated in the [[Modus ponens]] logical form:

# If an omniscient, omnibenevolent and omnipotent God exists, there should be no gratuitous evil.
# There exists instances of gratuitous evil.
# Therefore, an omniscient, omnibenevolent and omnipotent God does not exist.
In this logical form the conclusion (3) is true, if both the major premise (1) and minor premise (2) are true. Philosophers have challenged both premises, but skeptical theism focus is on the minor premise (2).

In 1979, the Philosopher William Rowe provided a defense of the minor premise (2). He argued that no state of affairs we know of is such that an omnipotent, omniscient being’s obtaining it would morally justify that being’s permitting some instances of horrific suffering. Therefore, Rowe concludes, it is likely that no state of affairs exists that would morally justify that being in permitting such suffering.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=William|year=1979|title=The Problem of Evil and Some Varieties of Atheism, American|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly .|volume=16|pages=335–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Rowe argues that his inability to think of a good reason why God would allow a particular evil justifies the conclusion that there is no such reason, and the conclusion that God does not exist.

=== The Noseeum Defense ===
The Philosophers Michael Bergmann and Michael Rea described the Philosopher William Rowe's justification for the second premise of the argument from evil:&lt;blockquote&gt;Some evidential arguments from evil ... rely on a “noseeum” inference of the following sort: NI: If, after thinking hard, we can’t think of any God-justifying reason for permitting some horrific evil then it is likely that there is no such reason. (The reason NI is called a ‘noseeum’ inference is that it says, more or less, that because we don’t see ‘um, they probably ain’t there.)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2005|title=Michael Bergmann and Michael Rea|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~mrea/papers/In%20Defense%20of%20Skeptical%20Theism.pdf|journal=The Australasian Journal of Philosophy|volume=83|pages=241–51|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109033308/http://www3.nd.edu/~mrea/papers/In%20Defense%20of%20Skeptical%20Theism.pdf|archivedate=2016-11-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=William|year=1988|title=Evil and Theodicy|journal=Philosophical Topics|volume=16|pages=119–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=William|title=Ruminations about Evil|journal=Philosophical Topics|volume=5|pages=69–88.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Various analogies are offered to show that the noseeum inference is logically dubious. For example, a novice chess player's inability to discern a chess master's choice of moves cannot be used to infer that there is no good reason for the move.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== The skeptical theism response ==
Skeptical theism provides a defense against the evidential argument from evil, but does not take a position on God’s ''actual'' reason for allowing a particular instance of evil.  The defense seeks to show that there are good reasons to believe that God ''could'' have justified reasons for allowing a particular evil that we cannot discern. Consequently, we are in no position to endorse the minor premise (2) of the argument from evil because we cannot be more than agnostic about the accuracy of the premise. This conclusion would be an undercutting defeater for the premise because there would be no justification for the conclusion that evils in our world are gratuitous.  To justify this conclusion, the skeptical theist argues that the limits of human cognitive faculties are grounds for skepticism about our ability to draw conclusions about God's motives or lack of motives; it is therefor reasonable to doubt the second premise.&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/skept-th/ Skeptical Theism], ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bergmann and Rae thus concluded that Rowe's inference is unsound.&lt;ref name="BergmannRea"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bergmann|first=Michael|year=2005|title=In Defense of Skeptical Theism: A Reply to Almeida and Oppy|url=http://nd.edu/~mrea/papers/In%20Defense%20of%20Skeptical%20Theism.pdf|journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy|volume=83|pages=241–51|doi=10.1080/00048400500111147|author2=[[Michael Rea]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for the History of Technology''', or '''SHOT''', is the primary professional society for historians of technology. SHOT was founded in 1958 in the United States, and it has since become an international society with members "from some thirty-five countries throughout the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyoftechnology.org "Home," ''Society for the History of Technology (SHOT)'']&lt;/ref&gt; SHOT owes its existence largely to the efforts of Professor [[Melvin Kranzberg]] (1917-1995). SHOT co-founders include John B. Rae, [[Carl W. Condit]], [[Thomas P. Hughes]], and [[Eugene S. Ferguson]]. SHOT's flagship publication is the journal ''[[Technology and Culture]]'', published by the Johns Hopkins University Press. Kranzberg served as editor of ''Technology and Culture'' until 1981, and was succeeded as editor by Robert C. Post until 1995, and John M. Staudenmaier from 1996 until 2010. The current editor of ''Technology and Culture'' is Suzanne Moon at the University of Oklahoma. SHOT is an affiliate of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] and the [[American Historical Association]] and publishes a joint booklet series with the AHA, "Historical Perspectives on Technology, Society, and Culture," under the co-editorship of [[Pamela O.

The history of technology was traditionally linked to economic history and history of science, but its interactions are now equally strong with environmental history, gender history, business history, and labor history. SHOT annually awards two book prizes, the Edelstein Prize and the [https://www.historyoftechnology.org/about-us/awards-prizes-and-grants/the-sally-hacker-prize/ Sally Hacker Prize], as well as the Kranzberg Dissertation Fellowship and the Brooke Hindle Postdoctoral Fellowship.  Its highest award is the [[Leonardo da Vinci Medal]]. Recipients of the medal include Kranzberg, Ferguson, Post, Staudenmaier, Bart Hacker, and Brooke Hindle. In 1968 Kranzberg was also instrumental in the founding of a sister society, the International Committee for the History of Technology ([[ICOHTEC]]) in 1968. The two societies complement each other.

The Society for the History of Technology is dedicated to the historical study of technology and its relations with politics, economic, labor, business, the environment, public policy, science, and the arts. The society now numbers around 1500 members, and holds its meeting at a non-North-American venue every third year. SHOT also sponsors smaller conferences focused on specialized topics, often jointly with other scholarly societies and organizations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10549">A '''sustainable development reserve''' ({{lang-pt|Reserva de Desenvolvimento Sustentável}}, RDS) in Brazil is a type of [[Protected areas of Brazil|protected area]] inhabited by a traditional population that seeks to preserve nature while maintaining and improving the life of the population through [[sustainable development]].

==Background==

The concept of Sustainable Development Reserves originated in the Projeto Mamirauá launched in the early 1990s by the Sociedade Civil Mamirauá.
The project followed the principle of management based on scientific research and controlled use of natural resources.
The local population participates actively in the planning process and in responsible for managing and monitoring the area.
Key aspects are that the strategy can adapt to changes in the market, private property is maintained, plans are implemented to improve living conditions, and the local people partner with government agencies and NGOs to develop proposals for sustainable use.{{sfn|Reservas de Desenvolvimento Sustentável – Sociedade Civil Mamirauá}}

The [[Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve]] was established in 1996, the first such reserve in Brazil.{{sfn|Reservas de Desenvolvimento Sustentável – Sociedade Civil Mamirauá}}
The adjacent [[Amanã Sustainable Development Reserve]] was established in 1998 after the successful implementation of the Mamirauá reserve, and was fully supported by the local people.
They already recognized the importance of preserving the vegetation and animals that they depend upon for their livelihood.{{sfn|Luiz Claudio Marigo|1999}}
The new category of protected area was included in the National Protected Areas System (SNUG), which defined types of [[Protected areas of Brazil|protected area of Brazil]] in 2000.{{sfn|Reservas de Desenvolvimento Sustentável – Sociedade Civil Mamirauá}}

==Structure==

A Sustainable Development Reserve (RDS) holds traditional populations that live by sustainable exploitation of natural resources, developed over generations and adapted to the local ecology, and that protect nature and maintain biological diversity.
The goals are to preserve nature while preserving and improving the quality of life of the traditional populations, and to advance scientific knowledge and understanding of traditional techniques for managing the environment.{{sfn|Reserva de Desenvolvimento Sustentáve – ISA}}

The land in an RDS is in the public domain, and may be expropriated.
Land use is regulated according to Law 9985 article 23 (2000) and in specific regulations.
A board of directors is chaired by the administrative agency and includes representatives of public bodies, civil society organizations and traditional populations living in the area.{{sfn|Reserva de Desenvolvimento Sustentáve – ISA}}
A management plan is created by the administrative agency, which recognises the dynamic balance between conservation goals and the size of the population.
Natural ecosystems may be exploited sustainably, and cultivation of introduced species is allowed, subject to the management plan.
The plan defines areas where the ecology is fully protected, buffer zones, zones of sustainable use and ecological corridors.
Public visits to the RDS are allowed and encouraged where compatible with local interests and the management plan.
Scientific research and education with focus on conservation of nature are also encouraged.{{sfn|Reserva de Desenvolvimento Sustentáve – ISA}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="115647">[[File:Pyxis Pharmacy Robot by Nurse Station.JPG|thumb|In the 21st century, robots are beginning to perform roles not just in manufacturing, but in the service sector; e.g. in healthcare.]]
'''Technological unemployment''' is the loss of jobs caused by [[technological change]]. Such change typically includes the introduction of labour-saving "mechanical-muscle" machines or more efficient "mechanical-mind" processes ([[automation]]). Just as horses employed as prime movers were gradually made obsolete by the automobile, humans' jobs have also been affected throughout [[modern history]]. Historical examples include [[Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|artisan weavers]] reduced to poverty after the introduction of [[Power loom|mechanized looms]]. During [[World War II]], [[Alan Turing]]'s [[Bombe]] machine compressed and decoded thousands of man-years worth of encrypted data in a matter of hours. A contemporary example of technological unemployment is the displacement of retail cashiers by [[Self-checkout|self-service tills]].

That technological change can cause short-term job losses is widely accepted. The view that it can lead to lasting increases in unemployment has long been controversial. Participants in the technological unemployment debates can be broadly divided into optimists and pessimists. ''Optimists'' agree that innovation may be disruptive to jobs in the short term, yet hold that various compensation effects ensure there is never a long-term negative impact on jobs,  whereas ''pessimists'' contend that at least in some circumstances, new technologies can lead to a lasting decline in the total number of workers in employment. The phrase "technological unemployment" was popularised by [[John Maynard Keynes]] in the 1930s, who said it was a "only a temporary phase of maladjustment".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/1930/our-grandchildren.htm The Economic Possibilities of our Grandchildren]'' (1930). E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3044448 SSRN, part 2(2)]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the issue of machines displacing human labour has been discussed since at least [[Aristotle]]'s time.

Prior to the 18th century both the elite and [[common people]] would generally take the pessimistic view on technological unemployment, at least in cases where the issue arose. Due to generally low unemployment in much of pre-modern history, the topic was rarely a prominent concern.  In the 18th century fears over the impact of machinery on jobs intensified with the growth of mass unemployment, especially in Great Britain which was then at the forefront of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Yet some economic thinkers began to argue against these fears, claiming that overall innovation would not have negative effects on jobs. These arguments were formalised in the early 19th century by the [[classical economists]]. During the second half of the 19th century, it became increasingly apparent that technological progress was benefiting all sections of society, including the working class. Concerns over the negative impact of innovation diminished. The term "[[Luddite]] fallacy" was coined to describe the thinking that innovation would have lasting harmful effects on employment.

The view that technology is unlikely to lead to long term unemployment has been repeatedly challenged by a minority of economists. In the early 1800s these included [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]] himself. There were dozens of economists warning about technological unemployment during brief intensifications of the debate that spiked in the 1930s and 1960s. Especially in Europe, there were further warnings in the closing two decades of the twentieth century, as commentators noted an enduring rise in unemployment suffered by many industrialised nations since the 1970s. Yet a clear majority of both professional economists and the interested general public held the optimistic view through most of the 20th century.

In the second decade of the 21st century,  a number of studies have been released suggesting that technological unemployment may be increasing worldwide. Oxford Professors [[Carl Benedikt Frey]] and Michael Osborne, for example, have estimated that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of automation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-01-01|title=The future of employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerisation?|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162516302244|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|volume=114|pages=254–280|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2016.08.019|issn=0040-1625|last1=Frey|first1=Carl Benedikt|last2=Osborne|first2=Michael A|citeseerx=10.1.1.395.416}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their findings have frequently been misinterpreted, and on the PBS NewsHours they again made clear that their findings do not necessarily imply future technological unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/brink-jobless-future|title=Are we on the brink of a jobless future?|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many economists and commentators still argue such fears are unfounded, as was widely accepted for most of the previous two centuries, concern over technological unemployment is growing once again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acting-man.com/?p=32134|title=In the Future, Will Everyone Be Unemployed?|date=4 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/05/15/news/economy/zero-unemployment/|title=What 0% unemployment looks like|first=Annalyn|last=Censky|website=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/07/world-without-work/395294/|title=A World Without Work|first=Derek|last=Thompson|publisher=|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' in 2017 quotes knowledgeable people such as economist [[Gene Sperling]] and management professor [[Andrew McAfee]] on the idea that handling existing and impending job loss to automation is a "significant issue".&lt;ref name="Dreyfuss_2017-03-24"&gt;{{Citation |last=Dreyfuss |first=Emily |date=2017-03-24 |title=Hate to break it to Steve Mnuchin, but AI’s already taking jobs |journal=Wired |url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/hate-break-steve-mnuchin-ais-already-taking-jobs/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding a recent claim by Treasury Secretary [[Steve Mnuchin]] that automation is not "going to have any kind of big effect on the economy for the next 50 or 100 years", says McAfee, "I don't talk to anyone in the field who believes that."&lt;ref name="Dreyfuss_2017-03-24"/&gt; Recent technological innovations have the potential to render humans obsolete with the professional, white-collar, low-skilled, creative fields, and other "mental jobs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/business/economy/a-future-without-jobs-two-views-of-the-changing-work-force.html|title=A Future Without Jobs?

The [[World Bank]]'s [[World Development Report]] 2019 argues that while automation displaces workers, technological innovation creates more new industries and jobs on balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2019|title=The Changing Nature of Work|access-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues within the debates==

===Long term effects on employment===
{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=There are more sectors losing jobs than creating jobs. And the general-purpose aspect of software technology means that even the industries and jobs that it creates are not forever.|source=Lawrence Summers&lt;ref name="summers" /&gt;|quoted=1}}

All participants in the technological employment debates agree that temporary job losses can result from technological innovation.  Similarly, there is no dispute that innovation sometimes has positive effects on workers. Disagreement focuses on whether it is possible for innovation to have a lasting negative impact on overall employment. Levels of persistent unemployment can be quantified empirically, but the causes are subject to debate. Optimists accept short term unemployment may be caused by innovation, yet claim that after a while, ''compensation effects'' will always create at least as many jobs as were originally destroyed.  While this optimistic view has been continually challenged, it was dominant among mainstream economists for most of the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 77 - 90"&gt;{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 77–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "sympathy"/&gt; For example, labor economists [[Jacob Mincer]] and Stephan Danninger develop an empirical study using micro-data from the [[Panel Study of Income Dynamics]], and find that although in the short run, technological progress seems to have unclear effects on aggregate unemployment, it reduces unemployment in the long run. When they include a 5-year lag, however, the evidence supporting a short-run employment effect of technology seems to disappear as well, suggesting that technological unemployment "appears to be a myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mincer|first=Jacob|last2=Danninger|first2=Stephan|date=July 2000|title=Technology, Unemployment, and Inflation|url=|journal=National Bureau of Economic Research|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[structural unemployment]], a lasting level of joblessness that does not disappear even at the high point of the [[business cycle]], became popular in the 1960s. For pessimists, technological unemployment is one of the factors driving the wider phenomena of structural unemployment. Since the 1980s, even optimistic economists have increasingly accepted that structural unemployment has indeed risen in advanced economies, but they have tended to blame this on [[globalisation]] and [[offshoring]] rather than technological change. Others claim a chief cause of the lasting increase in unemployment  has been the reluctance of governments to pursue [[Expansionary Fiscal Policy|expansionary policies]] since the [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displacement of Keynesianism]] that occurred in the 1970s and early 80s.&lt;ref name="Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 77 - 90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Effective Demand"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Vivarelli2012"/&gt; In the 21st century, and especially since 2013, pessimists have been arguing with increasing frequency that lasting worldwide technological unemployment is a growing threat.&lt;ref name = "sympathy"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "replicants"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the other hand, from a more positive perspective, some have argued that technological change will alter the structure of an organization in the sense that those in management roles will increasingly become more specialized to those roles as technology that assists collaboration and workflow management allows employees to manage themselves. The typical management role will, as a result, change to allow managers to concentrate on the task of supporting employees and improving their performance thus allowing them to add more, rather than less, value.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compensation effects===
[[File:BrownManchesterMuralJohnKay.jpg|thumb|''John Kay inventor of the Fly Shuttle AD 1753'', by [[Ford Madox Brown]], depicting the inventor [[John Kay (flying shuttle)|John Kay]] kissing his wife goodbye as men carry him away from his home to escape a mob angry about his labour-saving mechanical loom. Compensation effects were not widely understood at this time. ]]
Compensation effects are labour-friendly consequences of innovation which "compensate" workers for job losses initially caused by new technology. In the 1820s, several compensation effects were described by [[Jean-Baptiste Say|Say]] in response to Ricardo's statement that long term technological unemployment could occur. Soon after, a whole system of effects was developed by [[John Ramsay McCulloch|Ramsey McCulloch]].  The system was labelled "compensation theory" by [[Karl Marx|Marx]], who proceeded to attack the ideas, arguing that none of the effects were guaranteed to operate.  Disagreement over the effectiveness of compensation effects has remained a central part of academic debates on technological unemployment ever since.&lt;ref name = "Vivarelli2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blaug 1997 loc= p182"&gt;{{Harvnb|Blaug|1997|loc= p182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compensation effects include: 
# By new machines. (The labour needed to build the new equipment that applied innovation requires.)
# By new investments. (Enabled by the cost savings and therefore increased profits from the new technology.)
#  By changes in wages. (In cases where unemployment does occur, this can cause a lowering of wages, thus allowing more workers to be re-employed at the now lower cost.  On the other hand, sometimes workers will enjoy wage increases as their profitability rises. This leads to increased income and therefore increased spending, which in turn encourages job creation.)
# By lower prices.  (Which then lead to more demand, and therefore more employment.) Lower prices can also help offset wage cuts, as cheaper goods will increase workers' buying power.
# By new products. (Where innovation directly creates new jobs.)

The "by new machines" effect is now rarely discussed by economists; it is often accepted that Marx successfully refuted it.&lt;ref name = "Vivarelli2012"/&gt; Even pessimists often concede that product innovation associated with the "by new products" effect can sometimes have a positive effect on employment. An important distinction can be drawn between 'process'  and 'product' innovations.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Labour-displacing technologies can be classified under the headings of [[mechanization]], [[automation]], and process improvement. The first two fundamentally involve transferring tasks from humans to machines. The third often involves the elimination of tasks altogether. The common theme of all three is that tasks are removed from the workforce, decreasing employment. In practice, the categories often overlap: a process improvement can include an automating or mechanizing achievement. The line between mechanization and automation is also subjective, as sometimes mechanization can involve sufficient [[control theory|control]] to be viewed as part of automation.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from Latin America seems to suggest that product innovation significantly contributes to the employment growth at the firm level, more so than process innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crespi|first=Gustavo|last2=Tacsir|first2=Ezequiel|date=December 2012|title=Effects of Innovation on Employment in Latin America|url=|journal=Inter-American Development Bank|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which the other effects are successful in compensating the workforce for job losses has been extensively debated throughout the history of modern economics; the issue is still not resolved.&lt;ref name = "Vivarelli2012"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; One such effect that potentially complements the compensation effect is job [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]]. According to research developed by Enrico Moretti, with each additional skilled job created in high tech industries in a given city, more than two jobs are created in the non-tradable sector. His findings suggest that technological growth and the resulting job-creation in high-tech industries might have a more significant [[spillover effect]] than we have anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moretti|first=Enrico|date=May 2010|title=Local Multipliers|url=|journal=American Economic Review|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from Europe also supports such a job multiplier effect, showing local high-tech jobs could create five additional low-tech jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goos|first=Maarten|last2=Konings|first2=Jozef|last3=Vandeweyer|first3=Marieke|date=September 2015|title=Employment Growth in Europe: The Roles of Innovation, Local Job Multipliers and Institutions.|url=|journal=Tjalling C. Koopmans Research Institute|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many economists now pessimistic about technological unemployment accept that compensation effects did largely operate as the optimists claimed through most of the 19th and 20th century. Yet they hold that the advent of computerisation means that compensation effects are now less effective. An early example of this argument was made by [[Wassily Leontief]] in 1983. He conceded that after some disruption, the advance of [[mechanization]] during the Industrial Revolution actually increased the demand for labour as well as increasing pay due to effects that flow from increased [[productivity]]. While early machines lowered the demand for muscle power, they were unintelligent and needed large armies of human operators to remain productive. Yet since the introduction of computers into the workplace, there is now less need not just for muscle power but also for human brain power. Hence even as productivity continues to rise, the lower demand for human labour may mean less pay and employment.&lt;ref name = "Vivarelli2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Advance"/&gt; However, this argument is not fully supported by more recent empirical studies. One research done by [[Erik Brynjolfsson]] and [[Lorin Hitt|Lorin M. Hitt]] in 2003 presents direct evidence that suggests a positive short-term effect of computerization on firm-level measured productivity and output growth. In addition, they find the long-term productivity contribution of computerization and technological changes might even be greater.

===The Luddite fallacy===
{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=If the Luddite fallacy were true we would all be out of work because productivity has been increasing for two centuries.|source=[[Alex Tabarrok]]&lt;ref name="Tabarrok"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2003/12/productivity_an.html |title=Productivity and unemployment |accessdate=2007-03-11 |last=Tabarrok |first=Alex |authorlink=Alex Tabarrok |date=2003-12-31 |work=Marginal Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;|quoted=1}}
The term "Luddite fallacy" is sometimes used to express the view that those concerned about long term  technological unemployment are committing a fallacy, as they fail to account for compensation effects. People who use the term typically expect that technological progress will have no long term impact on employment levels, and eventually will raise wages for all workers, because progress helps to increase the overall wealth of society. The term is based on the early 19th century example of the [[Luddite]]s. During the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st century, the dominant view among economists has been that belief in long term technological unemployment was indeed a [[fallacy]]. More recently, there has been increased support for the view that the benefits of automation are not equally distributed.&lt;ref name = "sympathy"&gt;

There are two underlying premises for why long-term difficulty could develop. The one that has traditionally been deployed is that ascribed to the Luddites (whether or not it is a truly accurate summary of their thinking), which is that there is a finite amount of work available and if machines do that work, there can be no other work left for humans to do. Economists call this the [[lump of labour fallacy]], arguing that in reality no such limitation exists. However, the other premise is that it is possible for long-term difficulty to arise that has nothing to do with any lump of labour. In this view, the amount of work that can exist is infinite, but (1) machines can do most of the "easy" work, (2) the definition of what is "easy" expands as information technology progresses, and (3) the work that lies beyond "easy" (the work that requires more skill, talent, knowledge, and insightful connections between pieces of knowledge) may require greater cognitive faculties than most humans are able to supply, as point 2 continually advances. This latter view is the one supported by many modern advocates of the possibility of long-term, systemic technological unemployment.

===Skill levels and technological unemployment===
A common view among those discussing the effect of innovation on the labour market has been that it mainly hurts those with low skills, while often benefiting  skilled workers. According to scholars such as [[Lawrence F. Katz]], this may have been true for much of the twentieth century, yet in the 19th century, innovations in the workplace largely displaced costly skilled artisans, and generally benefited the low skilled.  While 21st century innovation has been replacing some unskilled work, other low skilled occupations remain resistant to automation, while white collar work requiring intermediate skills is increasingly being performed by autonomous computer programs.&lt;ref name = "relative"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Technical Change and the Relative Demand for Skilled Labor: The United States in Historical Perspective |first=Lawrence F. |last=Katz |first2=Robert A. |last2=Margo |title=Human Capital in History: The American Record |editor-last=Boustan |editor2-last=Frydman |editor3-last=Margo |year=2014 |doi=10.3386/w18752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "polarization"&gt;

Some recent studies however, such as a 2015 paper by Georg Graetz and Guy Michaels, found that at least in the area they studied – the impact of industrial robots – innovation is boosting pay for highly skilled workers while having a more negative impact on those with low to medium skills.&lt;ref name="GGG" /&gt; A 2015 report by [[Carl Benedikt Frey]], Michael Osborne and [[Citi Investment Research &amp; Analysis|Citi Research]], agreed that innovation had been disruptive mostly to middle-skilled jobs, yet predicted that in the next ten years the impact of automation would fall most heavily on those with low skills.&lt;ref name = "OM2015"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoff Colvin]] at [[Forbes]] argued that predictions on the kind of work a computer will never be able to do have proven inaccurate. A better approach to anticipate the skills on which humans will provide value would be to find out activities where we will insist that humans remain accountable for important decisions, such as with judges, [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]], bus drivers and government leaders, or where human nature can only be satisfied by deep interpersonal connections, even if those tasks could be automated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Humans are underrated|url = http://fortune.com/2015/07/23/humans-are-underrated/|website = Fortune|accessdate = 2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, others see even skilled human laborers being obsolete. Oxford academics Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A Osborne have predicted computerization could make nearly half of jobs redundant; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/15/robot-doctors-online-lawyers-automated-architects-future-professions-jobs-technology|author=Tom Meltzer|publisher=Wired|date=June 15, 2014|title=Robot doctors online lawyers automated architects: the future of the professions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the 702 professions assessed, they found a strong correlation between education and income with ability to be automated, with office jobs and service work being some of the more at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A. Osborne|title=The future of employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerization?|date=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 co-founder of [[Sun Microsystems]] [[Vinod Khosla]] predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/10/doctors-or-algorithms/|author=Vonod Khosla|publisher=Tech Crunch|title=Do We Need Doctors or Algorithms?|date=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Empirical findings ===
There has been a lot of empirical research that attempts to quantify the impact of technological unemployment, mostly done at the microeconomic level. Most existing firm-level research has found a labor-friendly nature of technological innovations. For example, German economists Stefan Lachenmaier and Horst Rottmann find that both product and process innovation have a positive effect on employment. They also find that process innovation has a more significant job creation effect than product innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lachenmaier|first=Stefan|last2=Rottmann|first2=Horst|title=May 2010|url=|journal=International Journal of Industrial Organization|volume=29|issue=2|pages=210–220|doi=10.1016/j.ijindorg.2010.05.004|year=2011|citeseerx=10.1.1.522.7577}}&lt;/ref&gt; This result is supported by evidence in the United States as well, which shows that manufacturing firm innovations have a positive effect on the total number of jobs, not just limited to firm-specific behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coad|first=Alex|last2=Rao|first2=Rekha|date=May 2011|title=The firm-level employment effects of innovations in high-tech US manufacturing industries|url=|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Economics|volume=21|issue=2|pages=255–283|doi=10.1007/s00191-010-0209-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the industry level, however, researchers have found mixed results with regard to the employment effect of technological changes. A 2017 study on manufacturing and service sectors in 11 European countries suggests that positive employment effects of technological innovations only exist in the medium- and high-tech sectors.There also seems to be a negative correlation between employment and capital formation, which suggests that technological progress could potentially be labor-saving given that process innovation is often incorporated in investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piva|first=Mariacristina|last2=Vivarelli|first2=Marco|date=January 2017|title=Technological Change and Employment: Were Ricardo and Marx Right?|url=|journal=Institute of Labor Economics|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limited macroeconomic analysis has been done to study the relationship between technological shocks and unemployment. The small amount of existing research, however, suggests mixed results. Italian economist Marco Vivarelli finds that the labor-saving effect of process innovation seems to have affected the Italian economy more negatively than the United States. On the other hand, the job creating effect of product innovation could only be observed in the United States, not Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Economics of Technology and Employment Theory and Empirical Evidence|last=Vivarelli|first=Marco|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=1995|isbn=978 1 85898 166 6|location=Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study in 2013 finds a more transitory, rather than permanent, unemployment effect of technological change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feldmann|first=Horst|date=November 2013|title=Technological unemployment in industrial countries|url=|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Economics|volume=23|issue=5|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measures of technological innovation ===
There have been four main approaches that attempt to capture and document technological innovation quantitatively. The first one, proposed by Jordi Gali in 1999 and further developed by Neville Francis and Valerie A. Ramey in 2005, is to use long-run restrictions in a Vector Autoregression (VAR) to identify technological shocks, assuming that only technology affects long-run productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gali|first=Jordi|date=1999|title=Technology, Employment, and the Business Cycle: Do Technology Shocks Explain Aggregate Fluctuations?|url=|journal=American Economic Review|volume=89|issue=1|pages=249–271|doi=10.1257/aer.89.1.249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Francis|first=Neville|last2=Ramey|first2=Valerie|date=2005|title=Is the Technology-Driven Real Business Cycle Hypothesis Dead? Shocks and Aggregate Fluctuations Revisited|url=|journal=Journal of Monetary Economics|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1379–1399|doi=10.1016/j.jmoneco.2004.08.009|citeseerx=10.1.1.198.157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second approach is from Susanto Basu, John Fernald and Miles Kimball.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Basu|first=Susanto|last2=Fernald|first2=John|last3=Kimball|first3=Miles|date=2006|title=Are Technology Improvements Contractionary?|url=|journal=American Economic Review|volume=96|issue=5|pages=1418–48|doi=10.1257/aer.96.5.1418|citeseerx=10.1.1.202.121}}&lt;/ref&gt; They create a measure of aggregate technology change with augmented [[Solow residual]]s, controlling for aggregate, non-technological effects such as non-constant returns and imperfect competition.

The third method, initially developed by John Shea in 1999, takes a more direct approach and employs observable indicators such as Research and Development (R&amp;D) spending, and number of patent applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shea|first=John|date=1998|title=What Do Technology Shocks Do?|url=|journal=NBER Macroeconomics Annual|volume=13|pages=275–322|doi=10.1086/ma.13.4623748}}&lt;/ref&gt; This measure of technological innovation is very widely used in empirical research, since it does not rely on the assumption that only technology affects long-run productivity, and fairly accurately captures the output variation based on input variation. However, there are limitations with direct measures such as R&amp;D. For example, since R&amp;D only measures the input in innovation, the output is unlikely to be perfectly correlated with the input. In addition, R&amp;D fails to capture the indeterminate lag between developing a new product or service, and bringing it to market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexopoulos|first=Michelle|last2=Cohen|first2=Jon|date=2011|title=Volumes of evidence: examining technical change in the last century through a new lens.|url=|journal=Canadian Journal of Economics|volume=44|issue=2|pages=413–450|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5982.2011.01639.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth approach, constructed by Michelle Alexopoulos, looks at the number of new titles published in the fields of technology and computer science to reflect technological progress, which turns out to be consistent with R&amp;D expenditure data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexopoulos|first=Michelle|date=2011|title=Read All about It!! What Happens Following a Technology Shock?|url=|journal=American Economic Review|volume=101|issue=4|pages=1144–1179|doi=10.1257/aer.101.4.1144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with R&amp;D, this indicator captures the lag between changes in technology.

==History==

===Pre-16th century===
[[File:Vespasianus03 pushkin.jpg|thumb|250px|Roman Emperor [[Vespasian]], who refused a low-cost method of transport of heavy goods that would put laborers out of work.]]
According to author Gregory Woirol, the phenomenon of technological unemployment is likely to have existed since at least the invention of the wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= p. 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ancient societies had various methods for relieving the poverty of those unable to support themselves with their own labour. [[Ancient China]] and [[ancient Egypt]] may have had various centrally run relief programmes in response to technological unemployment dating back to at least the second millennium BC.&lt;ref name="reflief"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Ancient Hebrews]] and adherents of the [[Hindus|ancient Vedic religion]] had decentralised responses where aiding the poor was encouraged by their faiths.&lt;ref name="reflief"/&gt; In [[ancient Greece]], large numbers of free labourers could find themselves unemployed due to both the effects of [[Ancient Greek technology|ancient labour saving technology]] and to competition from slaves ("machines of flesh and blood"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Forbes|1932|loc= p2}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Sometimes, these unemployed workers would starve to death or were forced into slavery themselves although in other cases they were supported by handouts. [[Pericles]] responded to perceived technological unemployment by launching [[public works]] programmes to provide paid work to the jobless. Conservatives criticized Pericle's programmes for wasting public money but were defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Forbes|1932|loc= pp24 -30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the earliest example of a scholar discussing the phenomenon of technological unemployment occurs with Aristotle, who speculated in Book One of ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' that if machines could become sufficiently advanced, there would be no more need for human labour.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the Greeks, [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]], responded to the problem of technological unemployment by relieving poverty with handouts. Several hundred thousand families were sometimes supported like this at once.&lt;ref name="reflief"/&gt; Less often, jobs were directly created with [[public works]] programmes, such as those launched by the [[Gracchi]]. Various emperors even went as far as to refuse or ban labour saving innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Forbes|1993|loc= chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Forbes|1932|loc=  ''passim'', see esp. pp. 49–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, the introduction of a labor-saving invention was blocked, when Emperor [[Vespasian]] refused to allow a new method of low-cost transportation of heavy goods, saying  "You must allow my poor hauliers to earn their bread."&lt;ref&gt;See book eight, chapt XVIII of Suetonius's [[The Twelve Caesars]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Labour shortages began to develop in the Roman empire towards the end of the second century AD, and from this point mass unemployment in Europe appears to have largely receded for over a millennium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Forbes|1932|loc= pp147 -150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and early [[The Renaissance|renaissance period]] saw the widespread adoption of newly invented technologies as well as older ones which had been conceived yet barely used in the Classical era.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mass unemployment began to reappear in Europe in the 15th century, partly as a result of population growth, and partly due to changes in the availability of land for subsistence farming caused by [[Tudor Enclosures|early enclosures]].&lt;ref name="Schumpeter 1987 loc= Chpt 6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Schumpeter|1987|loc= Chpt 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the threat of unemployment, there was less tolerance for disruptive new technologies. European authorities would often side with groups representing subsections of the working population, such as [[Guilds]], banning new technologies and sometimes even executing those who tried to promote or trade in them.&lt;ref&gt;On occasion these executions were carried out with methods normally reserved for only the worst criminals, for example on a single occasion in the south of France, 58 people were broken on the [[Breaking wheel|Catherine wheel]] for selling forbidden goods. See Chpt 1 of [[The Worldly Philosophers]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===16th to 18th century===
[[File:Elizabeth I Rainbow Portrait.jpg|thumb|right| [[Elizabeth I]] who refused to patent a knitting machine invented by [[William Lee (inventor)|William Lee]], saying  "Consider thou what the invention could do to my poor subjects. It would assuredly bring them to ruin by depriving them of employment, thus making them beggars."  ]]
In Great Britain, the ruling elite began to take a less restrictive approach to innovation somewhat earlier than in much of continental Europe, which has been cited as a possible reason for Britain's early lead in driving the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g by [[Sir John Habakkuk]] in ''American and British Technology in the Nineteenth Century'' (1962), [[Cambridge University Press]] – Habakkuk also went on to say that due to labour shortages, compared with their British counterparts there was far less resistance from U.S. workers  to the introduction of technology, leading to more update of innovation, and hence to the more efficient [[American system of manufacturing]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet concern over the impact of innovation on employment remained strong through the 16th and early 17th century. A famous example of new technology being refused occurred when the inventor [[William Lee (inventor)|William Lee]] invited Queen Elizabeth I to view a labour saving knitting machine. The Queen declined to issue a patent on the grounds that the technology might cause unemployment among textile workers. After moving to France and also failing to achieve success in promoting his invention, Lee returned to England but was again refused by Elizabeth's successor [[James VI and I|James I]] for the same reason.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;

Especially after the [[Glorious Revolution]], authorities became less sympathetic to workers concerns about losing their jobs due to innovation. An increasingly influential strand of [[Mercantilism|Mercantilist]] thought held that introducing labour saving technology would actually reduce unemployment, as it would allow British firms to increase their market share against foreign competition.  From the early 18th century workers could no longer rely on support from the authorities against the perceived threat of technological unemployment. They would sometimes take [[direct action]], such as machine breaking, in attempts to protect themselves from disruptive innovation. [[Schumpeter]] notes that as the 18th century progressed, thinkers would raise the alarm about technological unemployment with increasing frequency, with [[Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi|von Justi]] being a prominent example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schumpeter|1987|loc= Chpt 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Schumpeter also notes that the prevailing view among the elite solidified on the position that technological unemployment would not be a long term problem.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schumpeter 1987 loc= Chpt 6"/&gt;

===19th century===
It was only in the 19th century that debates over technological unemployment became intense, especially in Great Britain where many economic thinkers of the time were concentrated. Building on the work of [[Josiah Tucker|Dean Tucker]] and [[Adam Smith]], [[Political economy|political economists]] began to create what would become the modern discipline of [[economics]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Smith did not directly address the problem of technological unemployment, but the Dean had, saying in 1757 that in the long term, the introduction of machinery would allow more employment than would have been possible without them.&lt;/ref&gt; While rejecting much of mercantilism, members of the new discipline largely agreed that technological unemployment would not be an enduring problem.  In the first few decades of the 19th century, several prominent political economists did, however, argue against the optimistic view, claiming that innovation could cause long-term unemployment. These included [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi|Sismondi]],&lt;ref name="Sowell_2006"&gt;{{Citation |last=Sowell |first=T. |year=2006 |title=Chapter 5: Sismondi: A Neglected Pioneer |work=On Classical Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthus]], [[John Stuart Mill|J S Mill]], and from 1821, Ricardo himself.&lt;ref&gt;While initially of the view that innovation benefited the whole population,  Ricardo was persuaded by Malthus that technology could both push down wages for the working class, and cause long-term unemployment. He famously expressed these views in a chapter called  "on Machinery",  added to the third and final (1821) edition of [[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]&lt;/ref&gt; As arguably the most respected political economist of his age, Ricardo's view was challenging to others in the discipline. The first major economist to respond was [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], who argued that no one would introduce machinery if they were going to reduce the amount of product,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Typically the introduction of machinery would both increase output and lower cost per unit.&lt;/ref&gt; and that as [[Say's Law]]  states that supply creates its own demand, any displaced workers would automatically find work elsewhere once the market had had time to adjust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[John Ramsay McCulloch|Ramsey McCulloch]] expanded and formalised Say's optimistic views on technological unemployment, and was supported by others such as [[Charles Babbage]], [[Nassau Senior]] and many other lesser known political economists.  Towards the middle of the 19th century, [[Karl Marx]] joined the debates. Building on the work of Ricardo and Mill, Marx went much further, presenting a deeply pessimistic view of technological unemployment; his views attracted many followers and founded an enduring school of thought but mainstream economics was not dramatically changed.  By the 1870s,  at least in Great Britain, technological unemployment faded both as a popular concern and as an issue for academic debate. It had become increasingly apparent that innovation was increasing prosperity for all sections of British society, including the working class.  As the classical school of thought gave way to [[neoclassical economics]], mainstream thinking was tightened to take into account and refute the pessimistic arguments of Mill and Ricardo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 2, 20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[File:1980s computer worker, Centers for Disease Control.jpg|thumb|Critics of the view that innovation causes lasting unemployment argue that technology is used by workers and does not replace them on a large scale.]]
For the first two decades of the 20th century, mass unemployment was not the major problem it had been in the first half of the 19th. While the [[Marxian economics|Marxist school]] and a few other thinkers still challenged the optimistic view, technological unemployment was not a significant concern for mainstream economic thinking until the mid to late 1920s. In the 1920s mass unemployment re-emerged as a pressing issue within Europe.  At this time the U.S. was generally more prosperous, but even there urban unemployment had begun to increase from 1927. [[History of agriculture in the United States#1920s|Rural American workers had been suffering job losses]] from the start of the 1920s; many had been displaced by improved agricultural technology, such as the [[tractor]]. The centre of gravity for economic debates had by this time moved from Great Britain to the United States, and it was here that the 20th century's two great periods of debate over technological unemployment largely occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 2, 8–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak periods for the two debates were in the 1930s and the 1960s.  According to economic historian Gregory R Woirol, the two episodes share several similarities.&lt;ref name="Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 8 - 12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 8–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In both cases academic debates were preceded by an outbreak of popular concern, sparked by recent rises in unemployment. In both cases the debates were not conclusively settled, but faded away as unemployment was reduced by an outbreak of war – World War II for the debate of the 1930s, and the [[Vietnam war]] for the 1960s episodes. In both cases, the debates were conducted within the prevailing paradigm at the time, with little reference to earlier thought. In the 1930s, optimists based their arguments largely on neo-classical beliefs in the self-correcting power of markets to automatically reduce any short-term unemployment via compensation effects. In the 1960s, faith in compensation effects was less strong, but the mainstream [[Keynesian economists]] of the time largely believed government intervention would be able to counter any persistent technological unemployment that was not cleared by market forces. Another similarity was the publication of a major Federal study towards the end of each episode, which broadly found that long-term technological unemployment was not occurring (though the studies did agree innovation was a major factor in the short term displacement of workers, and advised government action to provide assistance).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In the 1930s, this study was 
''Unemployment and technological change''(Report no. G-70, 1940)  by Corrington Calhoun Gill  of the 'National Research Project on Reemployment Opportunities and Recent changes in Industrial Techniques'. It should be noted that some earlier Federal reports took a pessimistic view of technological unemployment, e.g.  ''Memorandum on Technological Unemployment'' (1933) by Ewan Clague  Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Some authorities – e.g.   Udo Sautter in Chpt 5 of ''Three Cheers for the Unemployed: Government and Unemployment Before the New Deal'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991) – say that in the early 1930s there was near consensus among US experts that technological unemployment was a major problem.  Other's though like [[Bruce Bartlett]] in [https://www.academia.edu/3465367/Is_Industrial_Innovation_Destroying_Jobs  Is Industrial Innovation Destroying Jobs (Cato Journal 1984)] argue that most economists remained optimistic even during the 1930s.  In the 1960s episode, the major Federal study that bookmarked the end of the period of intense debate was ''Technology and the American economy'' (1966) by the 'National Commission on Technology, Automation, and Economic Progress' [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=26449  established by president Lyndon Jonhson in 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woirol 1996 loc= pp. 8 - 12"/&gt;

As the [[golden age of capitalism]] came to a close in the 1970s, unemployment once again rose, and this time generally remained relatively high for the rest of the century, across most advanced economies.  Several economists once again argued that this may be due to innovation, with perhaps the most prominent being  [[Paul Samuelson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The authors describe how at a conference at the invitation of Mikhail Gorbachev with 500 leading politicians, business leaders and academics from all continents from September 27 – October 1, 1995 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco, the term "one-fifth-society" arose. The authors describe an increase in productivity caused by the decrease in the amount of work, so this could be done by one-fifth of the global labor force and leave four-fifths of the working age people out of work.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the closing decades of the 20th century saw much more concern expressed over technological unemployment in Europe, compared with the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= pp. 143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For the most part, other than during the periods of intense debate in the 1930s and 60s,  the consensus in the 20th century among both professional economists and the general public remained that technology does not cause long-term joblessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woirol|1996|loc= p. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concern about technological unemployment grew in 2013 due in part to a number of studies predicting substantially increased technological unemployment in forthcoming decades and empirical evidence that, in certain sectors, employment is falling worldwide despite rising output, thus discounting globalization and offshoring as the only causes of increasing unemployment.&lt;ref name = "replicants"&gt;{{Cite news

Concerns have included evidence showing worldwide falls in employment across sectors such as manufacturing; falls in pay for low and medium skilled workers stretching back several decades even as productivity continues to rise; the increase in often precarious [[Uberisation|platform mediated]] employment; and the occurrence of "jobless recoveries" after recent recessions. The 21st century has seen a variety of skilled tasks partially taken over by machines, including translation, legal research and even low level journalism. Care work, entertainment, and other tasks requiring empathy, previously thought safe from automation, have also begun to be performed by robots.&lt;ref name = "replicants"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Former U.S. Treasury Secretary and Harvard economics professor [[Lawrence Summers]] stated in 2014 that he no longer believed automation would always create new jobs and that "This isn't some hypothetical future possibility. This is something that's emerging before us right now." Summers noted that already, more labor sectors were losing jobs than creating new ones.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Other recent statements by Summers include warnings on the  "devastating consequences" for those who perform routine tasks arising from robots, 3-D printing, artificial intelligence, and similar technologies. In his view, "already there are more American men on disability insurance than doing production work in manufacturing. And the trends are all in the wrong direction, particularly for the less skilled, as the capacity of capital embodying artificial intelligence to replace white-collar as well as blue-collar work will increase rapidly in the years ahead."  Summers has also said that  "[T]here are many reasons to think the software revolution will be even more profound than the agricultural revolution. This time around, change will come faster and affect a much larger share of the economy. [...] [T]here are more sectors losing jobs than creating jobs. And the general-purpose aspect of software technology means that even the industries and jobs that it creates are not forever. [...] If current trends continue, it could well be that a generation from now a quarter of middle-aged men will be out of work at any given moment."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="summers"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lawrence H.

Other economists, however, have argued that long-term technological unemployment is unlikely.

General public surveys have often found an expectation that automation would impact jobs widely, but not the jobs held by those particular people surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/7/17089904/ai-job-loss-automation-survey-gallup|title=Most Americans think artificial intelligence will destroy other people’s jobs, not theirs|website=theverge.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Studies====
A number of studies have predicted that automation will take a large proportion of jobs in the future, but estimates of the level of unemployment this will cause vary. Research by [[Carl Benedikt Frey]] and Michael Osborne of the [[Oxford Martin School]] showed that employees engaged in "tasks following well-defined procedures that can easily be performed by sophisticated algorithms" are at risk of displacement. The study, published in 2013, shows that automation can affect both skilled and unskilled work and both high and low-paying occupations; however, low-paid physical occupations are most at risk.

However, not all recent empirical studies have found evidence to support the idea that automation will cause widespread unemployment. A study released in 2015, examining the impact of industrial robots in 17 countries between 1993 and 2007, found no overall reduction in employment was caused by the robots, and that there was a slight increase in overall wages.&lt;ref name = "GGG"&gt;{{cite web

It is not clear however why a job should be more or less automatise just because it is performed by a woman. In 2017, [[Forrester Research|Forrester]] estimated that automation would result in a net loss of about 7% of jobs in the US by 2027, replacing 17% of jobs while creating new jobs equivalent to 10% of the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forrester.com/Forrester+Predicts+Automation+Will+Displace+247+Million+Jobs+And+Add+149+Million+Jobs+By+2027/-/E-PRE9745|title=Forrester : Marketing : Forrester Predicts Automation Will Displace 24.7 Million Jobs And Add 14.9 Million Jobs By 2027|website=www.forrester.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study argued that the risk of US jobs to automation had been overestimated due to factors such as the heterogeneity of tasks within occupations and the adaptability of jobs being neglected. The study found that once this was taken into account, the number of occupations at risk to automation in the US drops, ceteris paribus, from 38% to 9%.&lt;ref&gt;Arntz, Melanie; Gregory, Terry; Zierahn, Ulrich [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318108672_Revisiting_the_Risk_of_Automation "Revisiting the Risk of Automation"], accessed 06/11/2017&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study on the effect of automation on Germany found no evidence that automation caused total job losses but that they do effect the jobs people are employed in; losses in the industrial sector due to automation were offset by gains in the service sector. Manufacturing workers were also not at risk from automation and were in fact more likely to remain employed, though not necessarily doing the same tasks. However, automation did result in a decrease in labour's income share as it raised productivity but not wages.&lt;ref&gt;Dauth, Wolfgang; Findeisen, Sebastian; Suedekum, Jens; Woessner, Nicole [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3039031 "German Robots - The Impact of Industrial Robots on Workers"], accessed 06/11/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 [[Brookings Institution]] study that analyzed 28 industries in 18 OECD countries from 1970 to 2018 found that automation was responsible for holding down wages. Although it concluded that automation did not reduce the overall number of jobs available and even increased them, it found that from the 1970s to the 2010s, it had reduced the share of human labor in the value added to the work, and thus had helped to slow wage growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/is-automation-labor-displacing-productivity-growth-employment-and-the-labor-share/|title=Is automation labor-displacing?

====Policy====
In 2017, [[South Korea]] became the most automated country on earth with one robot for every 19 employed humans.

==Solutions ==

===Preventing net job losses===

====Banning/refusing innovation====
[[File:Gandhi spinning.jpg|right|thumb|"What I object to, is the craze for machinery, not machinery as such. The craze is for what they call labour-saving machinery. Men go on 'saving labour', till thousands are without work and thrown on the open streets to die of starvation." — [[Gandhi]], 1924.&lt;ref&gt;For a small collection of quotes by Gandhi relating to his view that innovation should be slowed while unemployment exists see [http://www.mkgandhi.org/voiceoftruth/machinery.htm The place of machines]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Historically, innovations were sometimes banned due to concerns about their impact on employment. Since the development of modern economics, however, this option has generally not even been considered as a solution, at least not for the advanced economies. Even commentators who are pessimistic about long-term technological unemployment invariably consider innovation to be an overall benefit to society, with JS Mill being perhaps the only prominent western political economist to have suggested prohibiting the use of technology as a possible solution to unemployment.&lt;ref name="Blaug 1997 loc= p182"/&gt;

[[Gandhian economics]] called for a delay in the uptake of labour saving machines until unemployment was alleviated, however this advice was largely rejected by [[Nehru]] who was to become prime minister once India achieved its independence. The policy of slowing the introduction of innovation so as to avoid technological unemployment was however implemented in the 20th century within China under  [[Mao]]'s administration.&lt;ref&gt;

====Shorter working hours====
In 1870, the average American worker clocked up about 75 hours per week. Just prior to World War II working hours had fallen to about 42 per week, and the fall was similar in other advanced economies. According to [[Wassily Leontief]], this was a voluntary increase in technological unemployment. The reduction in working hours helped share out available work, and was favoured by workers who were happy to reduce hours to gain extra leisure, as innovation was at the time generally helping to increase their rates of pay.&lt;ref name = "Advance"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Further reductions in working hours have been proposed as a possible solution to unemployment by economists including [[John R. Commons]], Lord Keynes and [[Luigi Pasinetti]]. Yet once working hours have reached about 40 hours per week, workers have been less enthusiastic about further reductions, both to prevent loss of income and as many value [[workmanship|engaging in work for its own sake]].  Generally, 20th-century economists had argued against further reductions as a solution to unemployment, saying it reflects a [[Lump of labour fallacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====Public works====
Programmes of [[public works]] have traditionally been used as way for governments to directly boost employment, though this has often been opposed by some, but not all, conservatives. [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], although generally associated with free market economics, advised that public works could be a solution to technological unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baumol|2000|loc= p465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators, such as professor Mathew Forstater, have advised that public works and guaranteed jobs in the public sector may be the ideal solution to technological unemployment, as unlike welfare or guaranteed income schemes they provide people with the social recognition and meaningful engagement that comes with work.&lt;ref name = "unemployment history"&gt;

For [[Less developed country|less developed economies]], public works may be an easier to administrate solution compared to universal welfare programmes.&lt;ref name = "Advance"/&gt; As of 2015, calls for public works in the advanced economies have been less frequent even from progressives, due to concerns about [[sovereign debt]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}. A partial exception is for spending on infrastructure, which has been recommended as a solution to technological unemployment even by economists previously associated with a neoliberal agenda, such as [[Larry Summers]].&lt;ref name = "Inclusive"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Education====
Improved availability to quality education, including skills training for adults and other [[active labour market policies]], is a solution that in principle at least is not opposed by any side of the political spectrum, and welcomed even by those who are optimistic about long-term technological employment. Improved education paid for by government tends to be especially popular with industry.

Proponents of this brand of policy assert higher level, more specialized learning is a way to capitalize from the growing technology industry. Leading technology research university MIT published an [http://digital.mit.edu/openletter/pprecommendations.html open letter] to policymakers advocating for the "reinvention of education", namely a shift "away from rote learning" and towards [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.mit.edu/openletter/pprecommendations.html|title=Policy Recommendations|website=digital.mit.edu|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar statements released by the U.S President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology ([[United States President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology|PACST]]) have also been used to support this STEM emphasis on enrollment choice in higher learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aip.org/fyi/2012/presidents-council-advisors-science-and-technology-release-report-outlining-undergraduate|title=President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology Release Report Outlining Undergraduate Education Initiative|date=2014-06-02|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education reform is also a part of the U.K government's "Industrial Strategy", a plan announcing the nation's intent to invest millions into a "technical education system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-strategy-the-foundations/industrial-strategy-the-5-foundations#people|title=Industrial Strategy: the 5 foundations - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal includes the establishment of a retraining program for workers who wish to adapt their skill-sets. These suggestions combat the concerns over [[automation]] through policy choices aiming to meet the emerging needs of society via updated information. Of the professionals within the academic community who applaud such moves, often noted is a gap between economic security and formal education &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/home/33193.htm|title=Fall 2007|work=NEA|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a disparity exacerbated by the rising demand for specialized skills—and education's potential to reduce it.

However, several academics have also argued that improved education alone will not be sufficient to solve technological unemployment, pointing to recent declines in the demand for many intermediate skills, and suggesting that not everyone is capable in becoming proficient in the most advanced skills.&lt;ref name="relative" /&gt;&lt;ref name="polarization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reversal" /&gt;  [[K.

===Living with technological unemployment===

====Welfare payments====
The use of various forms of subsidies has often been accepted as a solution to technological unemployment even by conservatives and by those who are optimistic about the long term effect on jobs.  Welfare programmes have historically tended to be more durable once established, compared with other solutions to unemployment such as directly creating jobs with public works.  Despite being the first person to create a formal system describing  compensation effects, Ramsey McCulloch and most other classical economists advocated government aid for those suffering from technological unemployment, as they understood that market adjustment to new technology was not instantaneous and that those displaced by labour-saving technology would not always be able to immediately obtain alternative employment through their own efforts.&lt;ref name="Blaug 1997 loc= p182"/&gt;

=====Basic income=====
{{Main|Basic income|Guaranteed minimum income}}
Several commentators have argued that traditional forms of welfare payment may be inadequate as a response to the future challenges posed by technological unemployment, and have suggested a [[basic income]] as an alternative. People advocating some form of basic income as a solution to technological unemployment include Martin Ford, 
&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|2009|loc = ''passim'', see esp. pp. 158–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik Brynjolfsson]],&lt;ref name="control"/&gt;  [[Robert Reich]] and   [[Guy Standing (economist)|Guy Standing]].  Reich has gone as far as to say the introduction of a basic income, perhaps implemented as a [[negative income tax]] is "almost inevitable",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Since late 2015, new basic income pilots have been announced in Finland, the Netherlands, and Canada. Further recent advocacy for basic income has arisen from a number of technology entrepreneurs, the most prominent being [[Sam Altman]], president of [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Skepticism about basic income includes both [[left–right politics|right and left]] elements, and proposals for different forms of it have come from all segments of the spectrum. For example, while the best-known proposed forms (with taxation and distribution) are usually thought of as left-leaning ideas that right-leaning people try to defend against, other forms have been proposed even by [[libertarianism|libertarians]], such as [[Friedrich Hayek|von Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman|Friedman]]. Republican president [[Nixon]]'s Family Assistance Plan (FAP) of 1969, which had much in common with basic income, passed in the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] but was defeated in the [[United States Senate|Senate]].&lt;ref name="Nixon1978"&gt;{{cite book | last = Nixon | first = Richard | year = 1978 | title = RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon | publisher = Grosset &amp; Dunlap | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-448-14374-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One objection to basic income is that it could be a [[incentivisation|disincentive to work]], but evidence from older [[Basic income pilots|pilots]] in India, Africa, and Canada indicates that this does not happen and that a basic income encourages low-level [[entrepreneurship]] and more productive, collaborative work. Another objection is that funding it sustainably is a huge challenge. While new revenue-raising ideas have been proposed such as Martin Ford's wage recapture tax, how to fund a generous basic income remains a debated question, and skeptics have dismissed it as utopian. Even from a progressive viewpoint, there are concerns that a basic income set too low may not help the economically vulnerable, especially if financed largely from cuts to other forms of welfare.&lt;ref name="paypressure"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|2009|loc= pp.162-168}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "MITRotman"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

To better address both the funding concerns and concerns about government control, one alternative model is that the cost and control would be distributed across the private sector instead of the public sector. Companies across the economy would be required to employ humans, but the job descriptions would be left to private innovation, and individuals would have to compete to be hired and retained. This would be a for-profit sector analog of basic income, that is, a market-based form of basic income. It differs from a [[job guarantee]] in that the government is not the employer (rather, companies are) and there is no aspect of having employees who "cannot be fired", a problem that interferes with economic dynamism. The economic salvation in this model is not that every individual is guaranteed a job, but rather just that enough jobs exist that massive unemployment is avoided and employment is no longer solely the privilege of only the very smartest or highly trained 20% of the population. Another option for a market-based form of basic income has been proposed by the [[Center for Economic and Social Justice (CESJ)]] as part of "a Just Third Way" (a [[Third Way]] with greater justice) through widely distributed power and liberty. Called the Capital Homestead Act,&lt;ref name="Capital_Homestead_Act"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Center for Economic  |author2=Social Justice  |lastauthoramp=yes |authorlink=Center for Economic and Social Justice (CESJ) |title=Capital Homestead Act Summary |url=http://www.cesj.org/learn/capital-homesteading/capital-homestead-act-summary/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is reminiscent of [[James S. Albus]]'s Peoples' Capitalism&lt;ref name="peoplescapbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="peoplescap"/&gt; in that [[money creation]] and [[security (finance)|securities ownership]] are widely and directly distributed to individuals rather than flowing through, or being concentrated in, centralized or elite mechanisms.

====Broadening the ownership of technological assets====
Several solutions have been proposed which do not fall easily into the traditional [[left–right politics|left-right political spectrum]]. This includes broadening the ownership of  robots and other productive capital assets. Enlarging the ownership of technologies has been advocated by people including [[James S. Albus]]&lt;ref name="peoplescapbook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.james-albus.org |title=Dr. James Albus |publisher=James-albus.org |date = | accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lanchester]],&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lanchester|Lanchester, John]] (March 2015).

[[Jaron Lanier]] has proposed a somewhat similar solution: a mechanism where ordinary people receive "[[micropayment|nano payments]]" for the [[big data]] they generate by their regular surfing and other aspects of their online presence.&lt;ref&gt;

====Structural changes towards a post-scarcity economy====

[[The Zeitgeist Movement]] (TZM), [[The Venus Project]] (TVP) as well as various individuals and organizations&lt;!--name them here! If you're unsure add them here: Peter Diamandis, Cory Doctorow, ...--&gt; propose [[structural change]]s towards a form of a [[post-scarcity economy]] in which people are 'freed' from their automatable, monotonous jobs, instead of 'losing' their jobs. In the system proposed by TZM all jobs are either automated, abolished for bringing no true value for society (such as ordinary [[advertising]]), rationalized by more [[Efficiency|efficient]], [[sustainable]] and [[openness|open]] processes and collaboration or carried out based on [[altruism]] and social relevance (see also: [[Whuffie]]), opposed to compulsion or monetary gain.&lt;ref name=tzm1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Zeitgeist Movement FAQ #5 - 2) Automation of Labor|url=http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/FAQ#faq5|accessdate=4 January 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815095626/http://thezeitgeistmovement.com/faq#faq5|archivedate=15 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feuer|first1=Alan|title=Peter Joseph and Jacque Fresco Critique the Monetary Economy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/nyregion/17zeitgeist.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=5 January 2017|date=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Zeitgeist Movement Defined: Realizing a New Train of Thought|url=http://thezeitgeistmovement.com/uploads/upload/file/19/The_Zeitgeist_Movement_Defined_PDF_Final.pdf|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simon|first1=Alex|title=Awaiting Interreflections: Peter Joseph's Highly Anticipated New Film Series Inches Towards its 2016 Release|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alex-simon/awaiting-interreflections_b_7628680.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=5 January 2017|date=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donovan|first1=Travis|title=The Zeitgeist Movement: Envisioning A Sustainable Future|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/travis-walter-donovan/the-zeitgeist-movement-en_b_501517.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=5 January 2017|date=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement also speculates that the free time made available to people will permit a renaissance of creativity, invention, community and social capital as well as reducing stress.&lt;ref name=tzm1/&gt;

===Other approaches===
The threat of technological unemployment has occasionally been used by free market economists as a justification for supply side reforms, to make it easier for employers to hire and fire workers. Conversely, it has also been used as a reason to justify an increase in employee protection.&lt;ref name="Effective Demand"&gt;

Economists including [[Larry Summers]] have advised a package of measures may be needed. He advised vigorous cooperative efforts to address the "myriad devices" – such as tax havens, bank secrecy, money laundering, and regulatory arbitrage – which enable the holders of great wealth to avoid paying taxes, and to make it more difficult to accumulate great fortunes without requiring "great social contributions" in return. Summers suggested more vigorous enforcement of anti-monopoly laws; reductions in "excessive" protection for intellectual property; greater encouragement of profit-sharing schemes that may benefit workers and give them a stake in wealth accumulation; strengthening of collective bargaining arrangements; improvements in corporate governance; strengthening of financial regulation to eliminate subsidies to financial activity; easing of land-use restrictions that may cause estates to keep rising in value; better training for young people and retraining for displaced workers; and increased public and private investment in infrastructure development, such as energy production and transportation.&lt;ref name="summers"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT-2014-12-15/&gt;&lt;ref name="inequalityPuzzle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/dont-fear-the-robots-taking-your-job-blame-the-monopolies-behind-them|title=Don't Fear the Robots Taking Your Job, Fear the Monopolies Behind Them|author=Victoria Turk|date=2014-06-19|publisher=Vice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Spence]] has advised that responding to the future impact of technology will require a detailed understanding of the global forces and flows technology has set in motion. Adapting to them "will require shifts in mindsets, policies, investments (especially in human capital), and quite possibly models of employment and distribution".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Spence also wrote that "Now comes a ... powerful, wave of digital technology that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks. This process of labor substitution and [[disintermediation]] has been underway for some time in service sectors – think of ATMs, online banking, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, mobile payment systems, and much more. This revolution is spreading to the production of goods, where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor." In his view, the vast majority of the cost of digital technologies comes at the start, in the design of hardware (e.g. sensors) and, more important, in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks. "Once this is achieved, the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low (and declines as scale rises), and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero. With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing, the incentives to invest [in digital technologies] are compelling." Spence believes that, unlike prior digital technologies, which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world, the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies "is cost reduction via the replacement of labor." For example, as the cost of 3D printing technology declines, it is "easy to imagine" that production may become "extremely" local and customized. Moreover, production may occur in response to actual demand, not anticipated or forecast demand. "Meanwhile, the impact of robotics ... is not confined to production. Though self-driving cars and drones are the most attention-getting examples, the impact on logistics is no less transformative. Computers and robotic cranes that schedule and move containers around and load ships now control the Port of Singapore, one of the most efficient in the world." Spence believes that labor, no matter how inexpensive, will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion, with labor-intensive, process-oriented manufacturing becoming less effective, and that re-localization will appear globally. In his view, production will not disappear, but it will be less labor-intensive, and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Spence, [http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/michael-spence-describes-an-era-in-which-developing-countries-can-no-longer-rely-on-vast-numbers-of-cheap-workers Labor’s Digital Displacement] (2014-05-22), ''[[Project Syndicate]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the phrase '''testing the waters''' is used to describe someone who is exploring the feasibility of becoming a candidate for political office.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/rad/candidates/documents/CanGuideTestWater_000.pdf |accessdate=July 2, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703075138/http://www.fec.gov/rad/candidates/documents/CanGuideTestWater_000.pdf |archivedate=July 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/24/campaign-finance-law-2016_n_6932834.html |title='Testing The Waters': The Unseen Significance Of A Candidate Cliche |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2015-03-24 |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Testing the waters" activities are to be paid for with candidate-permissible funds.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt; Once an individual begins to campaign or decides to become a candidate, funds that were raised or spent to "test the waters" apply to the $5,000 threshold for qualifying as a candidate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; This is because there is a [[federal law]] that once an individual raises or spends $5,000 for a campaign, they are required to register as a [[federal candidate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patch.com/illinois/deerfield/nancy-rotering-accused-violating-federal-campaign-law-0 |title=Nancy Rotering Accused of Violating Federal Campaign Law By Conservative Group &amp;#124; Deerfield, IL Patch |publisher=Patch.com |date=2015-07-01 |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once that threshold is exceeded, the individual must register with the [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC) (candidates for the [[United States House of Representatives]]) or the [[Secretary of the Senate]] (candidates for the [[United States Senate]]), and begin to file reports (including in the first report all activity that occurred prior to reaching the $5,000 threshold).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Reporting on "testing the waters"==

This is a list of important landmarks in the history of systematic [[Philosophy|philosophical]] inquiry and [[Scientific method|scientific analysis]] of [[phenomena]]. The list seeks to highlight important stages in the development of thoughts and analysis towards conceptualizing and understanding phenomena. This list seeks to include all major landmarks in systematic analysis of phenomena across disciplines that seeks to implement formal methods and systematic formal analysis of phenomena. Thus it seeks to list major landmarks across all scientific philosophy and methodological sciences including [[physical sciences]], [[scientific philosophy (disambiguation)|scientific philosophy]], [[Formal science|formal disciplines]] or pure sciences, [[behavioural sciences]], [[social sciences]], [[biological sciences]], [[life sciences]] and other related disciplines.

The '''UOIT Engineering Students’ Society''', also known as '''UOIT EngSoc''', is the representative student body for all undergraduate full-time students enrolled in the [http://www.engineering.uoit.ca/ Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science (FEAS)] and the [http://nuclear.uoit.ca/ Faculty of Energy Systems and Nuclear Science (FESNS)] at the [[University of Ontario Institute of Technology|University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT)]]. In addition to providing funding for engineering clubs and groups, UOIT EngSoc organizes professional development, extracurricular and sports events for over 1,800 members, proudly representing engineering students at Ontario’s fastest growing university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=University of Ontario Institute of Technology|url=http://www.chfca.ca/members/member-directory/academic-members/university-of-ontario-institute-of-technology|accessdate=30 July 2012|author=Greg Naterer|quote=the province’s fastest-growing university}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Established and registered in 2003 under the [http://www.your-sa.ca/ Student Association at Durham College and UOIT] originally as a club and later in 2008 as a society, UOIT EngSoc is one of the largest and most active students’ societies at the university.&lt;ref name="General Information"&gt;{{cite web|title=UOIT Engineering Students' Society General Information|url=https://sites.google.com/a/uoitengsoc.com/general-information/home|publisher=UOIT Engineering Students' Society|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UOIT EngSoc is recognized by both the engineering faculties at UOIT and is formally affiliated with [[Canadian Federation of Engineering Students|Canadian Federation of Engineering Students (CFES)]] and the [http://www.essoc.ca/ Engineering Students’ Societies’ Council of Ontario (ESSCO)]. The UOIT Engineering Students’ Society currently operates under the governing policies of Student Association at Durham College and UOIT,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Societies Policy|url=http://www.your-sa.ca/files/2011/08/OPR_2_Societies_Policy.pdf|publisher=Student Association at Durham College and UOIT|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to its own governing documents including a constitution and policy manual. In addition to the base funding provided by UOIT’s Student Association, UOIT EngSoc has, in previous years, attempted to create a referendum to establish a levied fee for all its members in order to provide better services and increase representation for engineering students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Referenda Results 2012|url=http://www.your-sa.ca/home/referendum-results-2012/|publisher=Student Association at Durham College and UOIT|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, UOIT EngSoc was successful in passing the referendum, due to the efforts of Arnold Odrigio and the Engineering Opportunities Fee Committee.

==History==
The UOIT  Engineering Students’ Society was formed in 2003 by the first year of engineering students at the [[University of Ontario Institute of Technology]]. That year, the society was officially registered as a club under the [http://www.your-sa.ca/ Student Association at Durham College and UOIT], also known as the SA. For the following years the society remained relatively small and ran few events due to limited funding. In 2007, with Matt Cannon as President, the UOIT Engineering Students’ Society formally joined the [http://www.essco.ca/ Engineering Student Societies’ Council of Ontario (ESSCO)], and attended their first conference the Presidents’ Meeting, hosted by the [[University of Ottawa]] in September. The following year ESSCO Executives mandated the UOIT EngSoc to hold the 2008 Presidents’ Meeting, a conference attended by 30 participants, 2 from each member university. With Mary Viloria as President, the society’s team of executives ran that weekend-long conference with $300 from a bake sale and a $3000 donation by the faculty. That year the society organized the sale of engineering leather jackets, a Movember campaign, a pub night, and the engineering hockey team to go play in the interschool tournament. The society ran a very successful internal engineering competition and was able to send teams to compete provincially, and because the society also joined the [[Canadian Federation of Engineering Students|Canadian Federation of Engineering Students (CFES)]] that year, the teams were also able to compete nationally. In 2008, with the initiatives of the then President of the SA, Amy England, and Janelle MacDougall, an executive for the UOIT EngSoc, the SA formed a structure to support societies. The faculty heads of both FEAS and FESNS, advised representing all students in both faculties under one organization, and thus in 2008 the UOIT Engineering Students’ Society was registered as a society, which represented all students from FEAS and FESNS, under the Student Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memento from Janelle MacDougal|url=https://sites.google.com/a/uoitengsoc.com/general-information/memento-from-janelle-macdougall|publisher=UOIT Engineering Students' Society|accessdate=30 July 2012|author=Janelle MacDougall|date=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 2011, during the annual CFES Congress (hosted that year by Memorial University in St. John's, Newfoundland), UOIT officially joined [http://www.wesst.ca/ Western Engineering Students' Societies Team (WESST)].  Ryan Farrugia, the VP External at the time, purchased several raffle tickets under the name UOIT EngSoc and placed them all in the prize box for a Lifetime Membership is WESST.  During the final banquet, with delegates from all CFES member schools in attendance, one of the UOIT EngSoc's tickets was drawn and the UOIT EngSoc was made an official member of WESST.  The prize, along with the WESST member rules, and picture of Ryan and Glen Courtis accepting the prize was framed and hung in the UOIT EngSoc office.

==Traditions==
[[File:UOIT Engineering Students' Society Veronica.jpg|thumb|75px|right|Veronica]]

===Veronica===

Veronica is the symbol of any student in FEAS and FESNS at UOIT; she is the symbol of the UOIT Engineering Students' Society (UOIT EngSoc).  Veronica is a graphical image with the gear with an atom. Veronica's history lies in the society’s need to have a symbol for the representation of all engineering students UOIT.  The idea was originally codenamed “Vanna White,” however it was later changed to Veronica and has since been established as the symbol of all engineering students at UOIT. Veronica has also been incorporated into the UOIT Engineering Student Society’s Logo, representing as the ‘o’ in “EngSoc”.

In winter semester 2017 a number of engineering students acknowledged the glaring omission of a UOIT Engsoc mascot. A project was started to fabricate a physical Veronica gear to be brought to conferences. At time of writing although a 3D printed prototype has been seen at some events, the real Veronica is still yet to be complete.

[[File:Canadian Engineer Iron Ring.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Canadian Engineer's Iron Ring]]

===Iron Ring===

The [[Iron Ring]] is a unique [[Canada|Canadian]] tradition. Since 1922, Canadian engineering graduates have been able to participate in [[The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer]], a welcoming ceremony wherein new [[professionals]] receive an iron ring. The Iron ring represents an [[engineers]] choice to obligate themselves to the highest professionalism and humility for their profession and their moral and ethical commitment. The Iron Ring is worn on the little finger of the dominant hand and it acts a reminder of an engineers obligation because as an engineer works, it symbolically rubs off on all the engineers drawings and writings. Receiving an iron ring is separate from obtaining a [[university degree]] or an engineering license from a provincial or territorial engineering association such as [[Professional Engineers Ontario|Professional Engineers Ontario (PEO)]]. The Ritual is administered for UOIT engineering graduates by Camp 1 (Toronto region) of the body that oversees the Iron Ring tradition, [[The Corporation of the Seven Wardens|The Corporation of the Seven Wardens Inc.]] All graduating engineering students at UOIT may participate in this ceremony at the end of their final year.

===Lady Godiva and Godiva's Hymn===
Similarly to other engineering universities across [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Canada]], at UOIT [[Lady Godiva in popular culture|Lady Godiva]] is generally regarded as an engineering mascot and called the “Patron Saint of Engineers” or the “Goddess of Engineering.”  Historically, some university engineering organisations staged an annual "Godiva Ride" in which a naked female rode a horse across campus. This practice is not held at UOIT, perhaps due to modern feminist attitudes. [[Godiva's Hymn|Godiva’s Hymn]], an international engineering song, is sung by many UOIT Engineers at various events and conferences.

===Collaboration with Health Sciences===
Both the university’s Engineering Students’ Society and the [http://www.uoit-hsc.com/ Health Science Council] arrange and participate in events together like an annual pancake breakfast.

==Services==

===Mentorship Program===
There are currently over 60 [[volunteering|volunteers]] signed up for this new initiative at UOIT. The [[Mentorship]] Program is offered by the UOIT Engineering Students’ Society and provides incoming students (mentee) a upper year student (mentor) to help them transition from [[high school]] to [[university]]. The mentees are provided the mentor’s contact information and can e-mail the mentor at any time to ask any questions regarding services and classes on campus, as well as to offer social and emotional support in their first year at UOIT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mentorship Program|url=https://sites.google.com/a/uoitengsoc.com/mentorship-program/|publisher=UOIT Engineering Students' Society|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student Representation Program===
The UOIT Engineering Students’ Society Student Representatives recruited by the VP Academics and are responsible for representing students in their specific year and programs and reporting all issues facing students, academic, educational or otherwise, to the VP Academics. There are a total of 40 Student Representatives per year for both FEAS and FESNS, one for every program in each year. Upper year Student Representatives may be recruited by the VP Academics to sit on faculty academics councils. Unlike members of the council of the UOIT EngSoc, Student Representatives have no constitutional authorities other than the authorities of all members of the Membership.

===Engineering Study Sessions===
Engineering Study Sessions are a service provided by the UOIT Engineering Students’ Society in cooperation with the UOIT Academic Success Centre and professors from the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science and the Faculty of Science. Engineering Study Sessions are hosted specifically before midterms and final exams generally for 3-4 hour each. All UOIT engineering students are invited to attend these sessions and a variety of professors and teaching assistants are especially invited to teach approximately one-hour-long reviews in their respective subjects in order to aid engineering students in preparation for their exams. In addition, peer tutors and study skills specialists are also available to help students with questions one on one or in small groups.

===GNCTR===
The Great Northern Concrete Toboggan Race (GNCTR) is an annual event that has been held since 1974 amongst universities and technical schools from across Canada (with the odd entry from the United States and Europe). The project involves creating a toboggan with a metal frame and a running surface made completely out of concrete. The sled must weigh less than 136&amp;nbsp;kg with a braking system, a stirring system, and a roll bar to protect its five passengers. UOIT’s first took part in this race during the 2011-2012 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GNCTR|url=https://sites.google.com/a/uoitengsoc.com/clubs/gnctr|publisher=UOIT Engineering Students' Society|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''War studies''', sometimes called '''polemology''', is the [[Interdisciplinarity|multi-disciplinary]] study of [[war]]. The word derives from Ancient Greek πόλεμος (pólemos, "war") + -logy".

Polemology is distinct from [[military history]] in that it encompasses a variety of fields:
*[[Laws of war]]
*[[Philosophy of war]]
**[[Ethics of war]]

In botany, a '''whorl''' or '''verticil''' is an arrangement of [[sepal]]s, [[petal]]s, [[leaves]], [[stipule]]s or [[branch]]es that radiate from a single point and surround or wrap around the stem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/whorl|title=whorl|publisher=thedictionary|accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindley, John. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=c0k-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PR100#v=onepage&amp;f=false A Glossary of Technical Terms Used in Botany]'', p.100, Bradbury and Evans, London, 1848.&lt;/ref&gt; A whorl consists of at least three elements; a pair of [[opposite leaves]] is not called a whorl.

The [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of most [[Angiosperm]] flowers is based on four whorls. 
#The [[calyx (botany)|Calyx]]: a whorl of [[sepal]]s at the base.
#The [[corolla (flower)|Corolla]]: a whorl of [[petal]]s above the calyx. 
#The [[Androecium]]: a whorl of [[stamen]]s, each comprising a filament and an anther.
#The [[Gynoecium]]: a whorl of the female parts of a flower: the [[stigma (botany)|stigma]], [[style (botany)|style]] and [[ovary (plants)|ovary]].

A flower lacking any of these floral structures is said to be ''incomplete'' or ''imperfect''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Beentje, H. |author2=Williamson, J. |year=2010|title=The Kew Plant Glossary: an Illustrated Dictionary of Plant Terms|publisher=Kew Publishing|location=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all flowers consist of whorls since the parts may instead be spirally arranged, as in [[Magnoliaceae]].

For [[Phyllotaxis|leaves to grow in whorls]] is fairly unusual except in plant species with very short internodes. It does however occur in some trees such as ''[[Brabejum stellatifolium]]'' and other Proteaceae, such as some ''[[Banksia]]'' species. In examples such as those illustrated, crowded internodes within the whorls alternate with long internodes between the whorls.
