'''Aftershave''' is a liquid product applied to skin after [[shaving]]. It contains an [[antiseptic]] agent such as [[denatured alcohol]], stearate [[citrate]] or [[Witch hazel (astringent)|witch hazel]] to prevent infection of cuts, as well as to act as an [[astringent]] to reduce skin irritation. [[Menthol]] is used in some varieties as well to numb damaged skin, and it is an ingredient that [[shaving cream]] manufacturers have started including in their formulations, too.

An alcohol-based aftershave usually causes an immediate stinging sensation after applying it post-shave, with effects sometimes lasting several minutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |deadurl     = yes
 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most commonly only for seconds. For this reason, a market consisting of highly differentiated products has been created—some using alcohols, some not.

Some aftershaves use [[fragrance]] or [[essential oil]] to enhance scent. [[Moisturizer]]s—natural and artificial, are often touted as able to soften the [[skin]].

Aftershave is sometimes mistakenly referred to as [[eau de cologne]] due to the very similar nature of the two products. Some aftershave manufacturers encourage using their fragranced aftershave as if it were cologne, in order to increase sales by encouraging consumers to use it in a more versatile manner, rather than just after a shaving session. Some aftershaves were inspired by a cologne.

Early aftershaves included [[witch-hazel]] and [[bay rum]], and have been documented in shaving guides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/shavingmadeeasyw0020th |title=Shaving made easy; what the man who shaves ought to know .. : 20th century correspondence school, New York.

'''''Art on Paper''''' was a bi-monthly [[art magazine]] published from 1996 to 2009. The magazine's editorial scope included limited-edition prints and artists' [[book]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[photograph]]s, and [[ephemera]].

==History==
The magazine was founded in [[New York City]] in 1970 as ''The Print Collectors Newsletter''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephanie Murg|title=Art on Paper Folds, but Holds Out Hope for Imminent Revival|url=http://www.adweek.com/fishbowlny/art-on-paper-folds-but-holds-out-hope-for-imminent-revival/278975|accessdate=26 December 2015|work=FishbowlNY|date=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Paul Cummings]],&lt;ref name=artf&gt;{{cite news|title=Art on Paper Closes Print Edition After Forty Years|url=http://artforum.com/news/id=24788|accessdate=26 December 2015|work=Art Forum|date=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Judith Goldman as [[editor]]. Within a year, Cummings sold it to Jacqueline Brody, who continued to publish it until 1996.

From the start, the title ''The Print Collectors Newsletter,'' was a misnomer. The newsletter covered artists' prints from the [[Renaissance]] to the present, but it also published on artists' books, multiples, ephemera and photography. An issue typically included a feature story or interview, industry news, reviews of recently released prints or photographs, auction reports, and book reviews. Contributors included [[Holland Cotter]], Richard S. Field, Nancy Princenthal, Susan Tallman, [[Larry Qualls]] and others.

In 1996, Gabriella Fanning, the former editor of the art magazine ''Contemporanea,'' purchased ''The Print Collectors Newsletter''. She changed the name to ''On Paper'', converted it to a [[Magazine|journal]] format and expanded its coverage to include drawings. In 1998, she changed its title and format again, this time to a full-color glossy magazine titled ''Art on Paper''. Faye Hirsch, later Senior Editor at ''Art in America'', acted as Editor-in-Chief.

Fanning sold the title in 2004 to Darte Publishing LLC, a company established by the magazine's then editor, Peter Nesbett, and two partners. ''Art on Paper'' ceased publication in December 2009.&lt;ref name=artf/&gt; Nesbett resigned under a cloud of mystery.

''[[Art in Print]]'', the bimonthly journal on artists' prints that began publication in 2011, was founded as a not-for-profit organization and has no formal relationship to ''Art on Paper'', though many of the same writers contribute.

==Plot==
[[File:Tracy Bad Day at Black Rock Color Still 1955.jpg|thumb|left|[[Spencer Tracy]] and [[John Ericson]] in ''Bad Day at Black Rock'']]
In late 1945, one-armed John J. Macreedy ([[Spencer Tracy]]) gets off a passenger train at the isolated desert hamlet of Black Rock. It is the first time in four years that the train has stopped there. Macreedy is looking for a man named Komoko, but the few residents are inexplicably hostile. The young hotel desk clerk, Pete Wirth ([[John Ericson]]), claims he has no vacant rooms. Macreedy is threatened by Hector David ([[Lee Marvin]]). Later, Reno Smith ([[Robert Ryan]]) informs Macreedy that Komoko, a [[Japanese-American]], was [[Japanese American internment|interned during World War II]].

Certain that something is wrong, Macreedy sees the local sheriff, Tim Horn ([[Dean Jagger]]), but the alcoholic lawman is clearly afraid of Smith and is impotent to help. The veterinarian and undertaker, Doc Velie ([[Walter Brennan]]), advises Macreedy to leave town immediately, but also lets slip that Komoko is dead. Pete's sister, Liz ([[Anne Francis]]), rents Macreedy a [[Jeep]]. He drives to nearby Adobe Flat, where he finds a homestead burned to the ground and wildflowers. On the way back, Coley Trimble ([[Ernest Borgnine]]) tries to run him off the road.

Macreedy decides to leave town and goes to the garage to again rent the jeep from Liz; but she, having been confronted by Smith earlier, denies him the vehicle and drives away to avoid conversation about the strange goings-on in the town.  Macreedy then sits down outside the garage to consider his situation.  Smith comes by, ostensibly to fill his car with gas.  Smith asks and Macreedy discloses that he lost his left arm [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|fighting in Italy]]. Macreedy says the wildflowers at the Komoko place lead him to suspect that a body is buried there. Smith reveals that he is virulently anti-Japanese; he tried to enlist in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] the day after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], but failed the physical.

Macreedy tries to telephone the [[state police]] from Doc Velie's office, but Pete refuses to put the call through. Doc Velie admits that something terrible happened four years ago and that Smith has everyone too terrified to speak up. Velie offers Macreedy his [[hearse]] to leave town. Hector rips out the distributor cap and spark plug wires. Macreedy goes to Hastings' ([[Russell Collins]]) telegraph office and writes a [[telegraphy|telegram]] addressed to the state police. At the town diner, Trimble picks a fight with Macreedy, but Macreedy uses martial arts to beat him up. Macreedy tells Smith that he knows Smith killed Komoko and that he was too cowardly to do it alone, so he involved Hector, Pete, and Coley; Macreedy also warns that when Smith's hoods eventually realize they're being played by Smith one of them will turn against him.

[[File:Bad-Time-at-Honda-1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Robert Fawcett]] illustrated ''[[The American Magazine]]'' printing of "Bad Time at Honda", a 1947 short story by Howard Breslin that was adapted for the film ''Bad Day at Black Rock'']]

When Macreedy goes to the hotel lobby, Smith and his henchmen are already there, as are Doc Velie and Sheriff Horn. Hastings arrives and tries to give Smith a piece of paper, but Macreedy snatches it away and discovers that it is his own unsent telegram. Macreedy and Doc Velie demand that Sheriff Horn do something. When Horn tries, Smith just takes away his sheriff's badge and pins it on Hector. Hector tears up the telegram form.
After Smith and Hector leave, Macreedy reveals that the loss of his arm had left him wallowing in self-pity, but Smith's attempt to kill him has reinvigorated him.  Macreedy finally reveals why he is there: Komoko's son [[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|died in combat]] while saving Macreedy's life. Macreedy intended to give his posthumous medal to Komoko.  In turn, Macreedy learns that the elder Komoko had leased some farmland from Smith, who was sure there was no water there. Komoko had dug a well and found water. After Smith was turned down for enlistment after Pearl Harbor, he and the other men spent the day drinking, then decided to scare Komoko. The old man barricaded himself inside his home, but the men set the place on fire. When Komoko emerged ablaze, Smith shot him.

Pete sets in motion a plan, involving Liz and Doc Velie, to help Macreedy escape under cover of darkness. Hector is standing guard outside the hotel; Pete lures him into the hotel office, where Doc Velie knocks him out. Liz drives Macreedy out of town in her Jeep, but stops in a canyon. Macreedy realizes he has been betrayed. When Smith starts shooting at him, Macreedy hides behind the Jeep. Liz rushes to Smith despite Macreedy's warning. Smith tells her that she has to die along with the rest of his accomplices. He shoots her in the back as she runs away. Macreedy finds a bottle and fills it with [[gasoline]], creating a [[Molotov cocktail]]. When Smith climbs down for a better shot, Macreedy lights and throws it, setting Smith on fire.

Macreedy drives into town with the injured Smith and Liz's body. The state police are called in. As Macreedy is leaving, Doc Velie requests Komoko's medal to help Black Rock heal. Macreedy gives it to him just before boarding the train.

==Production==
[[Nicholas Schenck]], president of [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loews Incorporated]], MGM's parent company at the time, nearly did not allow the picture to be made because he felt that the story was subversive. The film's producer, [[Dore Schary]], wanted Spencer Tracy for the leading role. Concerned that Tracy might not accept, Schary ordered the script changed so that Macreedy was a one-armed man. He concluded that no actor would turn down the chance to play a character with a handicap. Screenwriter [[Millard Kaufman]], a World War II Marine platoon leader at age 25 thought Tracy too old for the role of a former platoon leader&lt;ref&gt;https://erenow.com/biographies/spencer-tracy/28.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

As John Wayne had recently made a film called ''[[Hondo (film)|Hondo]]'' the producers feared that calling their film ''Bad Day at Honda'' would confuse filmgoers into thinking they had already seen it.  Kaufman whilst location scouting in Arizona, came upon a post office and gas station collectively known as Black Rock. Kaufman telephoned Dore Schary to ask, "Why don’t we call it Black Rock? And do it in California?”&lt;ref&gt;https://erenow.com/biographies/spencer-tracy/28.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before shooting began, an indecisive Tracy tried to back out of the picture. Schary made clear that he was willing to sue the actor if he quit the film.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Andersen|Andersen, Christopher P.]], p.243&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Robert Osborne]] of the television network [[Turner Classic Movies]], in the introduction to the film's airing on its weekly segment ''[[The Essentials (TCM)|The Essentials]]'', Tracy, weighed down by his growing alcoholism, refused to give MGM an answer. In order to close the deal, according to Osborne, an MGM executive contacted Tracy shortly before filming was to begin and said, "Don't worry, Mr. Tracy, a copy of the script has been sent to [[Alan Ladd]] and he has agreed to do the picture." The next day, Tracy committed to ''Bad Day at Black Rock''. Ladd, however, apparently never even saw the script. It turned out to be Tracy's last film for MGM, with the exception of ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962), for which Tracy supplied the narration. 

Preview audiences reacted negatively to the film's original opening sequence. A revised one, showing the speeding train rushing at the camera, replaced it. The shot was taken from a helicopter as it flew away from the moving train. The film was run in reverse to create the opening shot.

''Bad Day at Black Rock'' was filmed in [[Lone Pine, California]] and the nearby [[Alabama Hills]], one of hundreds of movies that have been filmed in the area since 1920. The "town" of Black Rock was built for the film. Today nothing remains of the set, erected one mile north  ({{coord|36|38|2.84|N|118|2|23.74|W|scale:20000_type:city_region:US|display=inline,title}}) of the [[Lone Pine Station, California|Lone Pine station]], a stop on the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]'s [http://users.innercite.com/kj6ko/railroad.htm Jawbone Branch], which served the northern [[Mojave Desert]] and [[Owens Valley]].

==Reception==
According to MGM records the film earned $1,966,000 in the US and Canada and $1,822,000 elsewhere, making the studio a profit of $947,000.&lt;ref name="Mannix"/&gt;

===Critical response===
''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine's reviewer wrote: "Considerable excitement is whipped up in this suspense drama, and fans who go for tight action will find it entirely satisfactory. Besides telling a yarn of tense suspense, the picture is concerned with a social message on civic complacency."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117788838.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 ''Variety'']. Film review, 1954. Last accessed; February 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bosley Crowther]], film critic for ''[[The New York Times]],'' also liked it, writing, "Slowly, through a process of guarded discourse, which director John Sturges has built up by patient, methodical pacing of his almost completely male cast, an eerie light begins to glimmer&amp;nbsp;... Quite as interesting as the drama, which smacks of being contrived, are the types of masculine creatures paraded in this film. Mr. Tracy is sturdy and laconic as a war veteran with a lame arm (which does not hamper him, however, in fighting judo style). Mr. Ryan is angular and vicious as the uneasy king-pin of the town, and Walter Brennan is cryptic and caustic as the local mortician with a streak of spunk. Ernest Borgnine as a potbellied bully (he was Sgt. "Fatso" Judson in ''[[From Here to Eternity]]''), Dean Jagger as a rum-guzzling sheriff, Lee Marvin as a dimwitted tough, John Ericson as a nervous hotel clerk and Russell Collins as a station-master are all good, too."&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&amp;res=9E01EFDB1F3FE035A65751C0A9649C946492D6CF&amp;oref=slogin Crowther, Bosley]. ''The New York Times,'' film review, February 2, 1955. Last accessed: March 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a storyline she called "crudely melodramatic", [[Pauline Kael]] heaped praise on the film for its direction and cinematography, calling it "a very superior example of motion picture craftsmanship".&lt;ref name="Kael"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kael|first=Pauline|authorlink=Pauline Kael|title=5001 Nights at the Movies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w4LzeUZ03vQC|year=2011|origyear=1991|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|isbn=978-1-250-03357-4|pages=46–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bilge Ebiri]] considers the film to be "one of the greatest films ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|author=[[Bilge Ebiri]]|user=BilgeEbiri|number=821567879892140032|date=17 January 2017|title=This is one of the greatest films ever made.

===Cultural references===
The 1980s television program, ''[[The A-Team]]'', had a Season 1 [[word play]] title episode called "Black Day at Bad Rock", with a somewhat similar theme of an isolated California desert town, only this one a present-day town threatened by an oncoming [[biker gang]] out to free its leader and avenge his imprisonment by destroying the town.

One of the cartoon episodes in the ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Chuck Jones Collection]]'' is titled ''[[Bad Day at Cat Rock]]'', a pun on the film's title. The cartoon bears no resemblance to the film's plot.

'''Boat Quay''' is a historical [[quay]] in Singapore which is situated upstream from the mouth of the [[Singapore River]] on its southern [[river bank|bank]]. It spans from the shophouses near UOB Centre, stretching along one bank of the Singapore River, all the way till [[Elgin Bridge (Singapore)|Elgin Bridge]].

It was the busiest part of the old [[Port of Singapore]], handling three-quarters of all shipping business during the 1860s. Because the south of the river here resembles the belly of a [[carp]], which according to [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese belief]] is where wealth and prosperity lay, many shophouses were built, crowded into the area.

Though serving aquatic trade is no longer Boat Quay's primary role, the [[shophouse]]s on it have been carefully conserved and now house various bars, pubs and restaurants. Therefore, Boat Quay's social-economic role in the city has shifted away from that of trade and [[sea|maritime]] commerce, and now leans towards more of a role accommodated for tourism and [[aesthetics]] for the commercial zone of which encloses the Singapore River. It is the soft front to the composolitian banking and financial sectors lying immediately behind it.

Boat Quay is also the name of the road along the quay, which has since been converted into a pedestrian mall.

==History==
{{copy-paste|url=http://www.edmbooks.com/Book/6907/Singapores-100-Historic-Places.html|date=January 2017}}
[[File:boat quay night 2009n.JPG|thumb|left|The quay and the Singapore skyline at night]]
Since the [[founding of modern Singapore]] in 1819, the [[Singapore River]] was the artery for much of the island's trade and economic activities. The south [[river bank|bank]] of the river, where most of the commerce took place, is known as Boat Quay.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Ee: [http://www.edmbooks.com/Book/6907/Singapores-100-Historic-Places.html ''Singapore's 100 Historic Places.''] {{ISBN|978-981-4068-23-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1820s, the area was [[swamp]]y and built over with [[raft]] houses occupied by local traders. It was [[Land reclamation|reclaimed]] with earth taken from a small hill where Commercial Square, now [[Raffles Place]], stands.

As early as 1822, [[Sir Stamford Raffles]] had already designated the area south of the river to be developed as a Chinese settlement. Boat Quay was completed in 1842 and the Chinese, mostly traders and labourers, settled there in large numbers. Conditions were squalid but Boat Quay flourished, rapidly exceeding in volume the trade on the north bank where the [[European ethnic groups|European]]s had their offices, houses and government buildings.

In the midst of Boat Quay were the trading offices of some of Singapore's leading [[:wikt:towkay|towkay]] ([[Min Nan|Hokkien]] for business owners) and philanthropists, such as [[Tan Tock Seng]] and [[Tan Kim Seng]]. The level of activity on the river was an indicator of the island's economic status. In prosperous times, hundreds of bumboats would fight for limited [[Berth (moorings)|berth]]ing space. Goods were carried from ships anchored in the river, to the road by lighters and coolies. Traders bought and sold many items, from raw materials such as rubber, tin, and steel, to perishables such as rice and coffee, and many other manufactured goods.

Boat Quay was very resilient to change. Its role did not diminish even when a new [[harbour]] was built at [[Tanjong Pagar]] in 1852. On the contrary, it continued to grow, spurred on by the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869, when [[steamship]]s started calling at the [[port of Singapore]]. In fact, during that period, three-quarters of Singapore's overall trading business was transacted from Boat Quay.

Its decline really began in the 1960s, as mechanisation and computerisation gradually usurped the bumboat's role in the [[shipping industry]]. In September 1983, the government opened a modern, high-tech cargo centre in [[Pasir Panjang]]. This led to the rapid demise of Boat Quay's river trade, as the highly mechanised [[container port]] replaced the laborious and hazardous lighter system. Therefore, during the mid-1980s, after all the trading companies had moved out and the lighters removed, Boat Quay was devoid of activity, with the river deserted.

Boat Quay is now a business, dining, nightlife, and entertainment district for a mixture of locals, Western expats, and Western, Asian, and global tourists.

== Adaptive re-use of the historic buildings ==
[[File:Boat Quay 4, Dec 05.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Since the 1990s, Boat Quay has been transformed into a pedestrian mall with restaurants, pubs, cafes and clubs.]]
The Singapore government cleaned-up the river in 1983 and moved the remaining shipping industry's lighters were moved to a new quay near Pasir Panjang. Therefore, the Boat Quay was deserted and unused from 1983 to 1989.&lt;ref name="Lin"&gt;Eunice M.

In 1986, the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] announced plans to preserve Boat Quay as part of a master plan for conserving the whole of the Singapore River and its environs.

On 7 July 1989, an area encompassing [[South Bridge Road]], Circular Road, Lorong Telok and North Canal Road was gazetted. The two- and three-storey [[shophouse]]s in that area, with their characteristic [[five-foot way]] beneath projecting upper floors, were preserved and transformed into new businesses. The shophouses and [[godown]]s along the river bank were restored in the 1990s and are now bustling shops, restaurants and bars.

When the area became a conservation area in 1989, redevelopment began and by 1993 all historic shophouses were under reconstruction. The Singapore Urban Redevelopment Authority issued stringent guidelines for the restoration but did not provide cash grants or tax relief for conservation projects but waived some of the development charges, car parking requirements and car park deficiency charges.&lt;ref name="Lin"/&gt;

The historic shophouses could now easily be re-used for modern businesses, such as restaurants, cafes, bars and small shops. The interior of the buildings could be modified with the new use in mind, in some cases using new non-traditional interior ornamentation, materials, and colours. For instance, the interior of the Opera Cafe at No. 40 Boat Quay was modified to create an ambiance similar to an opera stage-set. The ground floor of the Lim Family Shophouse at No. 58 Boat Quay was converted into a Japanese restaurant. The upper floor is used as a weekend flat for the Lim family, who lived in the building since 1908. The architect Mok Wei Wei created more open space by demolishing some of the original partition walls, but kept and restored the original teak floors, paint colour on the window frames, wooden balcony doors, and tile roofs. The historic blackwood furniture and art pieces were also restored and re-used.&lt;ref name="Lin"/&gt;

Multiple startup companies also rent offices around the Boat Quay and nearby Circular Road area.

==Historical names==
[[File:Singa River Boat Quay in the mid-nineteenth century.jpg|thumb|Boat Quay during its heyday around 1865, when as many as 150 boats moored on the river, trading everything from rubber, tin and iron, to silk, porcelain, rice, opium, spices and coffee.&lt;ref name="Lin"/&gt;]]
Boat Quay is one of the early roads established when the [[Singapore River]] was the main port area of the colonial city. In the 19th century, the Chinese had several names for this road, referring to different sections of it:
*''tiam pang lo thau'' or "the place to go for [[sampan]]s";
*''chap sa hang'' (十三行) or "the thirteen shops" (the part near Canton Street);
*''chap peh keng'' (十八间) or "the eighteen houses" (the part near Circular Road);
*''chui chu boi'' or "bathing house end";&lt;ref name="Lin"/&gt;
*''khoi ki'' or "steam bank";
*''bu ye tian'' (不夜天) or "place of ceaseless activity"; and
*''tiam pang lo thau'' (place to go for sampans)&lt;ref name="Lin"/&gt; or "sampan ghaut or landing-place" (referring to the lower part of Boat Quay near Purvis Creek).
*''cha chun tau'' (柴船头), meaning "[[jetty]] for boats carrying [[firewood]]" (the part around Read Bridge)
*''chap poet heng'', meaning the eighteen houses&lt;ref name="Lin"/&gt;

Some of the quay's colloquial English names included:
*[[Suspension bridge]] Quay (after [[Cavenagh Bridge]]); and
*"The Belly of the [[Carp]]" because of the shape of the river at this point.

The '''Brescia Casket''' or '''Lipsanotheca''' (in Italian ''Lipsanoteca''&lt;ref&gt;"Lipsanotheca" is from the Greek λειψανοθήκη, for relic-container&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[ivory]] box, perhaps a [[reliquary]],&lt;ref&gt;It was certainly used as one later and this remains the most likely purpose. See Watson, 290 and 297, note 63. Only Bayens, 6 and elsewhere, suggests that it was an box for [[alms]].&lt;/ref&gt; from the late 4th century, which is now in the Museo di Santa Giulia at [[San Salvatore, Brescia|San Salvatore]] in  [[Brescia]], Italy.  It is a virtually unique survival of a complete [[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] ivory box in generally good condition.  The 36 subjects depicted on the box represent a wide range of the images found in the [[Early Christian art|evolving Christian art]] of the period,&lt;ref&gt;Watson says 35, Stella 36, but Watson counts the [[Ananias and Sapphira]] scenes as two; other sources give different figures, depending how the figures are divided in scenes.&lt;/ref&gt; and their identification has generated a great deal of art-historical discussion, though the high quality of the carving has never been in question.  According to one scholar: "despite an abundance of resourceful and often astute exegesis, its date, use, provenance, and meaning remain among the most formidable and enduring enigmas in the study of early Christian art".&lt;ref&gt;Mc Grath, 257&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex [[iconography]] of the five faces is illustrated and identified below.

==History==
The box was made by a northern Italian workshop, probably in Milan, where [[Saint Ambrose]] was bishop, and engaged in a struggle with the [[Arian]] [[heresy]]. Milan has long been considered the most likely place of origin, which has been further strengthened after the insignia on the shields of the soldiers were identified as those of a unit of the [[Scholae Palatinae|Palatine Guards]] stationed in Milan in the late 4th century, when Milan was the usual residence of the Imperial court. The ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'' in the [[Bodleian Library]] in [[Oxford]] records these designs.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 283&lt;/ref&gt; One theory, discussed below, identifies the date very precisely to soon after 386, when Ambrose successfully led the Orthodox population in a confrontation with the Arian-leaning Imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;Watson's main subject&lt;/ref&gt;   It has also been suggested that it was used for the relics of [[Gervasius and Protasius]], two Milanese Roman martyr saints whose remains were translated (dug up and moved) in Ambrose's time, as recorded in a letter of his; this was one of the earliest translations recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, 204(?)-212&lt;/ref&gt;  The silver lock plate is later, probably from the 8th century, and later metal hinges were removed in 1928.

It is not known when it entered the keeping of the convent of [[San Salvatore, Brescia]], but it may well have been soon after it was founded in 753 by [[Desiderius]], last of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] kings.  Whatever its original function it was used as a reliquary in the [[Middle Ages]], and was referred to in monastery documents as the "ivory sepulchre", possibly because it contained a stone taken from the [[empty tomb]] in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]].  It played a special role in the convent's [[Easter]] [[liturgy]], when in the early part of the [[Easter Vigil]] it was opened and the contents displayed to the congregation.&lt;ref&gt;Stella, 348&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1798, with the suppression of the convent after the Napoleonic invasion, it was transferred to the [[Biblioteca Queriniana]], the main library in Brescia, and in 1882 transferred to the museum that, after some moves, since 1999 has occupied part of the old convent home of the box. At some point during this period it was dismantled and the panels displayed laid out flat on a board forming a cross shape with a frame. The box was restored and re-assembled in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Stella, 348; some writers have questioned the correctness of this reconstruction, notably Christ and Kessler [https://books.google.com/books?id=uHxhAw_xEpQC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=Tkacz+Brescia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UgLZUJSiIua00QWfvoGIAw&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Tkacz%20Brescia&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Brescia Casket before 1928.jpg|thumb|450px|The Brescia Casket dismantled and framed, as it was displayed before 1928]]

The casket is rectangular, with five faces, four sides and a lid, held together by an internal framework of [[walnut]] wood, replaced when the casket was returned to its proper format in 1928, when the current short ivory feet were also added. Numerous [[carved ivory]] plaques are attached to the framework, carrying the decoration, with most zones of decoration on their own individual plaque.  The casket measures 22&amp;nbsp;cm high, 32&amp;nbsp;cm wide and 25&amp;nbsp;cm deep.&lt;ref&gt;Stella, 347; Watson, 284 and note 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The casket is covered with a profusion of small religious scenes carved in ivory [[relief]], drawn from both the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s.  The lid, which may be regarded as the most important face of a small box such as this, has the largest reliefs, with five scenes from the [[Passion of Christ]] in two registers, and a small top register with a frieze of birds.  All the four sides follow a design with a middle register containing relatively large New Testament subjects. Above and below this are narrower registers with Old Testament scenes, and at the corners thin vertical images, only one containing a human figure, the rest symbolic objects. The top of the side faces is finished with a register, actually the sides of the lid, of busts of male figures in slightly flattened round ''clipea'' frames.  Two of these are missing; there would have been a total of 17 originally, with five on the front, four on the back and four, one now missing, on each side. A young beardless Jesus is agreed to occupy the centre of the front panel, and he is probably surrounded by the [[Twelve Apostles]], with [[Saint Paul]] substituting for [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], making 13. Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and Paul are presumed to be the two older men with long beards flanking Jesus.  The remaining four heads, presumably those on the back face, might be the [[Four Evangelists]], which would mean repetition of subjects, or other saints.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 284, described in detail in later pages. Page 284 note 11, and 290 on the ''clipea''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The selection of incidents was long thought not to follow a specific programme, although Delbrueck in his monograph of 1939 was able to show that the majority of the scenes, including many of the rare ones, depicted events covered in the [[lectionary]] readings for the period of [[Lent]] and [[Easter]] that were used in Milan in Ambrose's time, about which we have a reasonable amount of information from Ambrose's surviving writings.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 283, 293-294 note 6&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Andre Grabar]] in 1969 wrote that "It is easy to establish the lack of any link (by likes or opposites) between the scenes on the two borders (Old Testament) and those of the central panel (New Testament)".&lt;ref&gt;Grabar, 137-138, 138 quoted; Watson, 283; Mc Grath, 257&lt;/ref&gt;

However recent studies have proposed that the casket in fact shows a coherent and carefully thought out programme, comprehending both Old and New Testament scenes, though the underlying aims of this have been interpreted differently.  Many of the scenes are very rarely depicted in surviving art, and several have had new identifications proposed in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;Watson's notes, many cited individually below, summarize most of the suggestions&lt;/ref&gt;  For Carolyn Joslin Watson, in a thesis of 1977 and an article in ''[[Gesta (journal)|Gesta]]'' in 1981, the key to the programme lies in Milanese church politics of the time, and Ambrose's battle with the Arians. For Catherine Brown Tkacz, in a book of 2001, the main purpose of the programme is to state through [[typology (theology)|typology]] the essential unity of the two parts of the Christian Bible, an aim common in later [[medieval art]], which was previously thought not to have been found so early.

The identification of many of the scenes remains uncertain, with new identifications having been proposed only recently,&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 283;&lt;/ref&gt; and not all identifications agreed between, for example, Watson in 1981, Tkacz in 2001 and Bayens in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;See below: the figures in flames, and the ''Transfiguration'' (Tkacz and Bayens) or ''Calling of Andrew and Peter'' (Watson) are examples.&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary identifications here follow Watson, sometimes mentioning alternatives. Watson's notes summarize most but not all other identifications.&lt;ref&gt;Watson describes the scenes at 285-290, with most of the alternatives in her notes 11-38 on pp. 294-296&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the scene on the back panel that Watson calls the ''Calling of Andrew and Peter'' by Jesus, which she admits is a rare subject not otherwise known in a similar composition, is called the ''[[Transfiguration of Christ]]'' by Tkacz, followed by Bayens and a number of reviewers.  That would also be an unusual depiction, though of a far more common subject.  The key difference in reading the image is whether the wavy lines the figures stand on represent cloud or water. All three authors are able to relate the subject they have chosen to their differing interpretations of the overall scheme of decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Watson 295, note 25, lists several other subjects that have been suggested, though not Jesus walking on the Lake of Galilee, which has had support in the past. Tkacz is one of those proposing the [[Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art|Transfiguration of Christ]], see Andreopoulos, 106-108. Bayens, 12 agrees.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons==
Probably the closest direct comparison to the Brescia casket is the [[Pula|Pola]] Casket, found in a fragmentary condition under a church floor in [[Istria]] in 1906, which has fewer scenes, and those rather more conventional.&lt;ref&gt;Soper, 153-157; illustrated Weitzmann, 595&lt;/ref&gt;  Another smaller casket, now dismantled, with four Passion scenes is in the [[British Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Roma, quattro lati di una scatola con scene della passione di cristo, 420-430 circa.JPG|Photo]]&lt;/ref&gt; which is also the home of the much later Anglo-Saxon [[Franks Casket]].  This has only one Christian scene, with others from northern myth and Mediterranean history, and includes texts which mingle Latin and [[Old English]] in both Roman letters and [[Anglo-Saxon runes]]. However it shares with the Brescia Casket great programmic complexity, and an equal ability to arouse scholarly debate; it seems clear that the full meaning of both boxes would have represented a puzzle, or [[riddle]], even to well-educated contemporaries used to the iconographies of their respective periods.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, 92&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caribbean Bird Vendor''' is a painting by [[Ellis Wilson]] in 1953. It is now part of [[Hampton University]]’s permanent exhibition.

== Description ==
The painting is [[Oil painting|oil]] on [[canvas]] and is roughly {{convert|3|ft|m|0}} wide and {{convert|2|ft|m|1}} tall. The work is an [[Expressionism|expressionistic]] [[portrait]] of a dark skinned, shirtless, adult [[Caribbean]] male holding three birds. The man and his three birds are all looking straight out of the painting at the viewer. Hazy, neutral yellow leaves are in the background, while the man and his other two birds are dark. The [[parrot]] sitting on the man’s shoulder is calm and his beak is closed. The second bird is sitting on the man’s cupped palm and resting, his beak is also closed. The man is wrapping one arm around the biggest bird. This bird is bright lilac and very elaborate, contrasting with the rest of the painting. The bird’s beak is open and its wings are spread as if it is about to break free of the man’s arm and take flight.

[[File:Charles Edward Faxon00a.jpg|thumb]]
'''Charles Edward Faxon''' (January 21, 1846 – February 6, 1918) was an American [[botanical artist]] and instructor of [[botany]] born in [[Jamaica Plain]], [[Massachusetts]].

In 1867 he received his degree in [[civil engineering]] from [[Lawrence Scientific School]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]. From 1879 to 1884, he taught classes in botany at the [[Bussey Institute]].

Faxon was knowledgeable in regards to the flora of [[New England]], and in 1882 joined the staff at the [[Arnold Arboretum]]. Here he took charge of development of the [[herbarium]] and [[library]]. He worked closely with [[Charles Sprague Sargent]] (1841-1927), the director of the [[arboretum]].

== Publications ==
Faxon created 744 plates for illustration of Sargent's "Silva of North America". In addition to these drawings, he provided the illustrative work for the following publications by Sargent:
* "Manual of the Trees of North America (exclusive of Mexico)", (664 illustrations). 
* "Garden and Forest", (285 illustrations).
* "Forest Flora of Japan", (1894).
* "Trees and Shrubs: Illustrations of New Or Little Known Ligneous Plants", (1902–13).

The '''''Communion of the Apostles''''', or '''''Institution of the Eucharist''''' is a painting of the [[Last Supper]] by [[Federico Barocci]] located at [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]] in Rome. It was commissioned for the family chapel of [[Pope Clement VIII]] Aldobrandini and completed between 1603 and 1608.&lt;ref name=Apostasy&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verstegen|first1=Ian|title=The apostasy of Michelangelo in a painting by Federico Barocci|journal=Notes in the History of Art|date=Spring 2003|volume=22|issue=3|pages=27–34|jstor=23206723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was most likely the sight of Barocci's ''Presentation of the Virgin'' in the Chiesa Nuova at its unveiling in 1603 that led to the commission of the ''Communion'' four months later. On 13 August 1603 the pope communicated with the minister to [[Francesco Maria II della Rovere]], duke of Urbino, Giacomo Sorbolongo, about acquiring an altarpiece from Barocci.{{efn|Stasera uerso il tardi il Papa mi ha fatto chiamare, et quando sono stato dent'ro, mi ha detto ridendo, che se bene era cosa leggieri, per la quale mi hauea fatto dimandare, era per'o un suo gusto et seguit'o, come fa fabricare una Capella qui nella Minerua in memoria de' suoi, Padre, Madre et fratelli, et desiderando, che nell'altare di essa ci fosse il quadro fatto da uallente huomo, se bene qui ce ne sono et in particulare ha Iseppino, non dimeno si sodisfarebbe assai hauerlo di mano del Baroccio.}} At this time the [[Cavaliere d'Arpino]] was the pope's most important artist; the letter goes on to ask that d'Arpino not be told of the commission.{{efn|desidera non si sappia da altri tal pratica, massime per rispetto d'Iseppino}}&lt;ref name=Verstegen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verstegen|first1=Ian|title=Federico Barocci, Federico Borromeo, and the Oratorian Orbit|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|date=Spring 2003|volume=56|issue=1|pages=56–87|doi=10.2307/1262258|jstor=1262258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Raffael 066.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Detail from the ''School of Athens'', Michelangelo as Heraclitus]]
The commission was completed entirely in [[Urbino]] and efforts were made to supply Barocci with extensive information about the contextual chapel, which was frescoed by [[Cherubino Alberti]] with a ''Triumph of the Holy Cross''.&lt;ref name=Emiliani&gt;{{cite book|last1=Emiliani|first1=Andrea|title=Federico Barocci (Urbino 1535-1612)|date=1985|publisher=Nuova Alfa Editoriale|location=Bologna|pages=376–385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gian Pietro Bellori wrote that the pope was supplied with preparatory sketches.&lt;ref name=Wohl&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellori|first1=Giovanni Pietro|last2=Wohl|first2=Alice Sedgwick|last3=Wohl|first3=Hellmut|last4=Montanari|first4=Tomaso|title=Giovan Pietro Bellori: The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects: A New Translation and Critical Edition|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521781879|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm9gs8mXwOUC|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pope sought the removal of Satan from the original design,&lt;ref name=Apostasy/&gt; and thereafter asked that it depict a night scene.&lt;ref name=McGrath&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGrath|first1=Thomas|title=Color and the Exchange of Ideas between Patron and Artist in Renaissance Italy|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=June 2000|volume=82|issue=2|pages=298–308|doi=10.2307/3051378|jstor=3051378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barocci quotes from [[Raphael]]'s ''[[School of Athens]]'' by inserting the portrait of [[Heraclitus]], which many believe is a portrait of [[Michelangelo]]. Significantly, he depicts [[Judas Iscariot]] using Michelangelo's portrait.&lt;ref name=Apostasy/&gt; To an audience familiar with this association, this would have been taken as particularly strong commentary on the status of the Michelangelo.&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hansen|first1=Morten Steen|title=In Michelangelo's Mirror|date=2013|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=9780271056401|pages=148–149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUI9xD9ghpgC|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, by directly quoting from Raphael, who was Michelangelo's antithesis and favoured by the Clementine church, Barocci, and by implication Pope Clement VIII, inserted a comment on the relative status of the two artists within the church of the time.&lt;ref name=Apostasy/&gt;

Barocci asked 1,500 scudi for the altarpiece. The fee undoubtedly was influenced by the number of figures. At the same point in his career (1604), he had accepted 300 scudi for a much simpler ''Crucifixion'' (Museo del Prado, Madrid).&lt;ref name=Spear&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spear|first1=Richard|title=Scrambling for Scudi: Notes on Painters' Earnings in Early Baroque Rome|journal=The Art Bulletin|date=June 2003|volume=85|issue=2|pages=310–320|doi=10.2307/3177346|jstor=3177346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''De Proprietatibus Elementorum''''' (English: On the Properties of the Elements) is a [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[Arabic language|Arabic]] treatise on [[geology]]. It is also known as '''''De Causis Proprietatum Elementorum''''', '''''De Proprietatibus Elementorum et Planetarum''''' or simply '''''De Elementis'''''.{{sfn|Vermij|1998|p=324}} It was probably written in the ninth{{sfn|Vermij|1998|p=324}} or tenth century.{{sfn|Crombie|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bGDScHy1clsC&amp;pg=PA133 133]}} The author of the work claimed to be [[Aristotle]], but eventually it was determined that it was an original work by an [[Arabs|Arab]] author. Consequently, the work is now attributed to a [[Pseudo-Aristotle]].{{sfn|Peters|1961|p=[https://books.google.nl/books?id=RswUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA57 57–58]}}

== History ==
The work did not have a lasting impact on [[science in the medieval Islamic world]], but it became important in Europe after it was translated to [[Latin]] by [[Gerard of Cremona]] in the twelfth century.{{sfn|Peters|1961|p=[https://books.google.nl/books?id=RswUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA57 57–58]}} By the thirteenth century, it had become one of the three main sources for medieval knowledge on geology, together with Aristotle's ''[[Meteorology]]'' and [[Avicenna]]'s ''De Mineralibus''. These three treatises were an important influence on the study of geology by [[Albertus Magnus]].{{sfn|Crombie|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bGDScHy1clsC&amp;pg=PA133 133–135]}} When scholars started to recognize during [[the Renaissance]] that ''De Proprietatibus Elementorum'' was not written by Aristotle, it was removed from the academic curriculum.{{sfn|Vermij|1998|p=324}}

== Content ==
In his work ''Meteorology'', Aristotle explained that the earth as an element was cold and dry. He did not cover phenomena related to terrestrial heat. ''De Proprietatibus Elementorum'' filled this lacuna with its inquiry on [[volcano]]es and [[hot spring]]s. According to the work large quantities of [[sulfur]] in the interior of a mountain caused volcanic eruptions. Winds and waters present at the foot of the mountain could set fire to this sulfur, particularly in the case of [[Mount Etna]].{{sfn|Vermij|1998|p=324–325}}

Its explanation of hot springs seems to have been taken by an unknown work from [[Theophrastus]]. Theophrastus or the pseudo-Aristotle first dismisses several explanations provided by [[Democritus]], Mileus and Rentifolus, the latter two possibly [[Thales]] and [[Xenophanes]]. The opinion of the author follows, that water gets heated by beds of sulfur before it emerges on the surface. [[Naphtha]] is associated with this process, because together with sulfur it forms a kind of burner to transport fuel to the fire.{{sfn|Vermij|1998|p=328}}

'''Erna Auerbach''' (Frankfurt am Main 1897–London 1975) was a [[Germany|German]]-born artist and art historian best known for her work on artists of the Tudor-era in England.

== Biography ==
She was the daughter of the painter Emma Kehrmann (1867-1958).&lt;ref name="DAH"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor-last= Sorenson|editor-first=Lee|title=Auerbach, Erna  |encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of Art Historians]]|url=http://arthistorians.info/auerbache|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She studied art history at the universities of Frankfurt, Bonn and Munich, under [[Rudolf Kautzsch]], who supervised her doctotate, and [[Heinrich Wölfflin]].  But she trained as a painter after taking her doctorate. She exhibited in Germany and, after emigrating to England in 1933 (her family was Jewish), in her new home as well. When her studio was destroyed in World War II, she returned to art history. 

She studied at the [[Courtauld Institute]] in London after the war, focusing on the [[artists of the Tudor court]], and wrote a second [[dissertation]] on patronage and painting in 16th-century England.&lt;ref name="DAH" /&gt; This would become the subject of her first published book, ''Tudor Artists'' (1954), the first work in modern times to lay out the documentary sources for the arts of painting and [[limning]] in the Tudor and Elizabethan periods.&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/research/programmes/making-art-in-tudor-britain/workshops/workshop-1-abstract-6.php|last=Howard|first=Maurice|title=Historiographies for Painting in Tudor Britain|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She died in [[London]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="DAH" /&gt;

The film premiered at the [[67th Venice International Film Festival]] on September 6, 2010.&lt;ref name="labiennale1"&gt;{{cite web|title=La Biennale di Venezia – I'm Still Here |url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/lineup/off-sel/out-of-competition/here.html |publisher=[[Venice Film Festival]] |accessdate=August 27, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sI2Pudk4?url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/lineup/off-sel/out-of-competition/here.html |archivedate=August 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a [[limited release]] in the United States on September 10, 2010 before being expanded to a wide release a week later on September 17.&lt;ref name="deadline1"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Magnolia Will Platform Joaquin Phoenix Mockumentary By Casey Affleck Sept. 10 |first=Mike |last=Fleming |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/07/magnolia-will-platform-joaquin-phoenix-mockumentary-by-casey-affleck-on-sept-10/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=July 14, 2010 |accessdate=August 27, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sI37xmIE?url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/07/magnolia-will-platform-joaquin-phoenix-mockumentary-by-casey-affleck-on-sept-10/ |archivedate=August 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although widely suspected to be a "mockumentary", the fact that the events of the film had been deliberately staged was not disclosed until after the film had been released.&lt;ref name="AffleckSpeaks" /&gt;

==Plot==
In 2008, while rehearsing for a charity event, actor Joaquin Phoenix, with Casey Affleck's camera watching, tells people he's quitting to pursue a career in rap music. Over the next year, we watch the actor write, rehearse, and perform to an audience. He importunes Sean Combs in hopes he'll produce the record. We see the actor in his home: he parties, smokes, bawls out his two-man entourage, talks philosophy with Affleck, and comments on celebrity.

==Production==

According to Phoenix, the film arose from his amazement that people believed [[reality television]] shows' claims of being unscripted. By claiming to retire from acting, he and his friend and brother-in-law Casey Affleck planned to make a film that "explored celebrity, and explored the relationship between the media and the consumers and the celebrities themselves" through their film.&lt;ref name="letterman2010"&gt;''Late Show with David Letterman'', 22 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In May 2010, the film was shown to potential buyers. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that the film featured "more male frontal nudity than you’d find in some [[gay porn]] films and a stomach-turning sequence in which someone feuding with Phoenix defecates on the actor while he’s asleep". Also, the film is said to depict Phoenix "snorting [[cocaine]], ordering call girls, having oral sex with a publicist, treating his assistants abusively and rapping badly." Reportedly film buyers, after seeing it, were still uncertain whether it was a serious documentary or a mockumentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Horn|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2010/05/joaquin-phoenix-documentary-even-buyers-arent-sure-if-its-a-prank.html|title=Joaquin Phoenix documentary: Even buyers aren't sure if it's a prank : Los Angeles Times: 24 Frames|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32189">The '''knowledge argument''' (also known as  '''Mary's room'''  or '''Mary the super-scientist''') is a philosophical [[thought experiment]] proposed by [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] in his article "Epiphenomenal [[Qualia]]" (1982) and extended in "What Mary Didn't Know" (1986). The experiment is intended to argue against [[physicalism]]—the view that the universe, including all that is mental, is entirely physical. The debate that emerged following its publication became the subject of an edited volume—''There's Something About Mary'' (2004)—which includes replies from such philosophers as [[Daniel Dennett]], [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], and [[Paul Churchland]].

==Background==
Mary's Room is a thought experiment that attempts to establish that there are non-physical properties and attainable knowledge that can be discovered only through conscious experience. It attempts to refute the theory that all knowledge is physical knowledge. [[C. D. Broad]], [[Herbert Feigl]], and [[Thomas Nagel]], over a fifty-year span, presented insight to the subject, which led to Jackson's proposed thought experiment. Broad makes the following remarks, describing a thought experiment where an archangel has unlimited mathematical competences:

{{quote|He would know exactly what the microscopic structure of ammonia must be; but he would be totally unable to predict that a substance with this structure must smell as ammonia does when it gets into the human nose. The utmost that he could predict on this subject would be that certain changes would take place in the mucous membrane, the olfactory nerves and so on. But he could not possibly know that these changes would be accompanied by the appearance of a smell in general or of the peculiar smell of ammonia in particular, unless someone told him so or he had smelled it for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Broad|1925|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Roughly thirty years later, Feigl expresses a similar notion. He concerns himself with a Martian, studying human behavior, but lacking human sentiments. Feigl says:

{{quote|...the Martian would be lacking completely in the sort of imagery and empathy which depends on familiarity (direct acquaintance) with the kinds of qualia to be imaged or empathized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Feigl|1958|p=431}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nagel takes a slightly different approach. In an effort to make his argument more adaptable and relatable, he takes the stand of humans attempting to understand the sonar capabilities of bats. Even with the entire physical database at one's fingertips, humans would not be able to fully perceive or understand a bat's sonar system, namely what it is like to perceive something with a bat's sonar.&lt;ref name=plato&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-knowledge/ |first=Martine |last=Nida-Ruemelin |title=Qualia: The Knowledge Argument |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought experiment==
The thought experiment was originally proposed by Frank Jackson as follows:
{{Quotation|Mary is a brilliant scientist who is, for whatever reason, forced to investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and white television monitor. She specializes in the [[neurophysiology]] of vision and acquires, let us suppose, all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes, or the sky, and use terms like "red", "blue", and so on. She discovers, for example, just which wavelength combinations from the sky stimulate the retina, and exactly how this produces via the [[central nervous system]] the contraction of the vocal cords and expulsion of air from the lungs that results in the uttering of the sentence "The sky is blue". [...] What will happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given a [[color television]] monitor? Will she learn anything or not?&lt;ref name="p130"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jackson|1982|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, Jackson's Mary is a scientist who knows everything there is to know about the science of color, but has never ''experienced'' color. The question that Jackson raises is: once she experiences color, does she learn anything new? Jackson claims that she does.

There is disagreement about how to summarize the premises and conclusion of the argument Jackson makes in this thought experiment. Paul Churchland did so as follows:
# Mary knows everything there is to know about brain states and their properties.
# It is not the case that Mary knows everything there is to know about sensations and their properties.
# Therefore, sensations and their properties are not the same (≠) as the brain states and their properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Churchland|first=Paul M.|date=1985-01-01|title=Reduction, Qualia, and the Direct Introspection of Brain States|jstor=2026509|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=82|issue=1|pages=8–28|doi=10.2307/2026509}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Jackson objects that Churchland's formulation is not his intended argument. He especially objects to the first premise of Churchland's formulation: "The whole thrust of the knowledge argument is that Mary (before her release) does not know everything there is to know about brain states and their properties, because she does not know about certain qualia associated with them. What is complete, according to the argument, is her knowledge of matters physical." He suggests his preferred interpretation:
# Mary (before her release) knows everything physical there is to know about other people.
# Mary (before her release) does not know everything there is to know about other people (because she learns something about them on her release).
# Therefore, there are truths about other people (and herself) which escape the physicalist story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Frank|date=1986-01-01|title=What Mary Didn't Know|jstor=2026143|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=83|issue=5|pages=291–295|doi=10.2307/2026143}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most authors who discuss the knowledge argument cite the case of Mary, but Frank Jackson used a further example in his seminal article: the case of a person, Fred, who sees a color unknown to normal human perceivers.

==Implications==
Whether Mary learns something new upon experiencing color has two major implications: the existence of [[qualia]] and the knowledge argument against physicalism.

===Qualia===
First, if Mary does learn something new, it shows that [[qualia]] (the subjective, qualitative properties of experiences, conceived as wholly independent of behavior and disposition) exist. If Mary gains something after she leaves the room — if she acquires knowledge of a particular thing that she did not possess before — then that knowledge, Jackson argues, is knowledge of the qualia of seeing red. Therefore, it must be conceded that qualia are real properties, since there is a difference between a person who has access to a particular quale and one who does not.

===Refutation of physicalism===
Jackson argues that if Mary does learn something new upon experiencing color, then [[physicalism]] is false. Specifically, the knowledge argument is an attack on the physicalist claim about the completeness of physical explanations of mental states. Mary may know everything about the science of color perception, but can she know what the experience of red is like if she has never seen red? Jackson contends that, yes, she has learned something new, via experience, and hence, [[physicalism]] is false. Jackson states:

{{quote|It seems just obvious that she will learn something about the world and our visual experience of it. But then it is inescapable that her previous knowledge was incomplete. But she had all the physical information. Ergo there is more to have than that, and Physicalism is false.&lt;ref name="p130"/&gt;}}

=== Epiphenomenalism ===
Jackson believed in the explanatory completeness of [[physiology]], that all behaviour is caused by physical forces of some kind. And the thought experiment seems to prove the existence of qualia, a non-physical part of the mind. Jackson argued that if both of these theses are true, then [[epiphenomenalism]] is true — the view that mental states are caused by physical states, but have no causal effects on the physical world.

Thus, at the conception of the thought experiment, Jackson was an epiphenomenalist.

==Responses==
Objections have been raised that have required the argument to be refined. Doubters cite various holes in the thought experiment that have arisen through critical examination.

Nemirow and Lewis present the "ability hypothesis", and Conee argues for the "acquaintance hypothesis".  Both approaches attempt to demonstrate that Mary ''gains no new knowledge, but instead gains something else''. If she in fact gains no new propositional knowledge, they contend, then what she does gain may be accounted for within the physicalist framework. These are the two most notable{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} objections to Jackson's thought experiment, and the claim it sets out to make.

=== Design of the thought experiment ===
Some have objected to Jackson's argument on the grounds that the scenario described in the thought experiment itself is not possible. For example, Evan Thompson questioned the premise that Mary, simply by being confined to a monochromatic environment, would not have any color experiences, since she may be able to see color when dreaming, after rubbing her eyes, or in afterimages from light perception.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, E. ''Colour Vision'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt; However, Graham and Horgan suggest that the thought experiment can be refined to account for this: rather than situating Mary in a black and white room, one might stipulate that she was unable to experience color from birth, but was given this ability via medical procedure later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=George|last2=Horgan|first2=Terence|date=2000-05-01|title=Mary Mary, Quite Contrary|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1018779425306|journal=Philosophical Studies|language=en|volume=99|issue=1|pages=59–87|doi=10.1023/A:1018779425306|issn=0031-8116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nida-Rümelin recognizes that one might question whether this scenario would be possible given the science of color vision (although Graham and Horgan suggest it is), but argues it is not clear that this matters to the efficacy of the thought experiment, provided we can at least conceive of the scenario taking place.&lt;ref name="plato" /&gt;

Objections have also been raised that, even if Mary's environment were constructed as described in the thought experiment, she would not, in fact, learn something new if she stepped out of her black and white room to see the color red.  Daniel Dennett asserts that if she already truly knew "everything about color", that knowledge would necessarily include a deep understanding of why and how human neurology causes us to sense the "qualia" of color. Moreover, that knowledge would include the ability to functionally differentiate between red and other colors. Mary would therefore already know exactly what to expect of seeing red, before ever leaving the room. Dennett argues that functional knowledge is identical to the experience, with no ineffable 'qualia' left over.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Dennett|1991|p=398}} &amp; {{Harvnb|Dennett|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; J. Christopher Maloney argues similarly:  &lt;blockquote&gt;If, as the argument allows, Mary does understand all that there is to know regarding the physical nature of colour vision, she would be in a position to imagine what colour vision would be like. It would be like being in physical state S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, and Mary knows all about such physical states. Of course, she herself has not been in S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, but that is no bar to her knowing what it would be like to be in S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;. For she, unlike us, can describe the nomic relations between S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; and other states of chromatic vision...Give her a precise description in the notation of neurophysiology of a colour vision state, and she will very likely be able to imagine what such a state would be like.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maloney|first=J. Christopher|date=1985-03-01|title=About being a bat|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00048408512341671|journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy|volume=63|issue=1|pages=26–49|doi=10.1080/00048408512341671|issn=0004-8402}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;Surveying the literature on Jackson's argument, Nida-Rümelin identifies, however, that many simply doubt the claim that Mary would not gain new knowledge upon leaving the room, including physicalists who do not agree with Jackson's conclusions. Most cannot help but admit that "new information or knowledge comes her way after confinement," enough that this view "deserves to be described as the received physicalist view of the Knowledge Argument."&lt;ref name="plato" /&gt;

Some philosophers have also objected to Jackson's first premise by arguing that Mary could not know all the physical facts about color vision prior to leaving the room. Owen Flanagan argues that Jackson's thought experiment "is easy to defeat". He grants that "Mary knows everything about color vision that can be expressed in the vocabularies of a complete physics, chemistry, and neuroscience," and then distinguishes between "metaphysical physicalism" and "linguistic physicalism":  &lt;blockquote&gt;Metaphysical physicalism simply asserts that what there is, and all there is, is physical stuff and its relations. Linguistic physicalism is the thesis that everything physical can be expressed or captured in the languages of the basic sciences…Linguistic physicalism is stronger than metaphysical physicalism and less plausible.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;Flanagan argues that, while Mary has all the facts that are expressible in "explicitly physical language," she can only be said to have all the facts if one accepts linguistic physicalism. A metaphysical physicalist can simply deny linguistic physicalism and hold that Mary's learning what seeing red is like, though it cannot be expressed in language, is nevertheless a fact about the physical world, since the physical is all that exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://webcat1.library.ubc.ca:80/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=881540|title=Consciousness reconsidered|last=Flanagan|first=Owen J.|date=1992-01-01|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0262061481|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to Flanagan, Torin Alter contends that Jackson conflates physical facts with "discursively learnable" facts, without justification:  &lt;blockquote&gt;…some facts about conscious experiences of various kinds cannot be learned through purely discursive means. This, however, does not yet license any further conclusions about the nature of the experiences that these discursively unlearnable facts are about. In particular, it does not entitle us to infer that these experiences are not physical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alter|first=Torin|date=1998|title=A Limited Defense of the Knowledge Argument|jstor=4320837|journal=Philosophical Studies|volume=90|issue=1|pages=35–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Nida-Rümelin argues in response to such views that it is "hard to understand what it is for a property or a fact to be physical once we drop the assumption that physical properties and physical facts are just those properties and facts that can be expressed in physical terminology."&lt;ref name="plato" /&gt;

===Ability hypothesis===
Several objections to Jackson have been raised on the grounds that Mary does not gain new factual knowledge when she leaves the room, but rather a new ability. Nemirow claims that "knowing what an experience is like is the same as knowing how to imagine having the experience". He argues that Mary only obtained the ability to do something, not the knowledge of something new.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://webcat1.library.ubc.ca:80/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=1057122|title=Mind and cognition: a reader|date=1990-01-01|publisher=Basil Blackwell|isbn=0631160760|editor-last=Lycan|editor-first=William G.|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis put forth a similar argument, claiming that Mary gained an ability to "remember, imagine and recognize."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0195032047.001.0001/acprof-9780195032048|title=Philosophical Papers Volume I - Oxford Scholarship|last=Lewis|first=David|doi=10.1093/0195032047.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the response to Jackson's knowledge argument, they both agree that someone makes a genuine discovery when she sees red for the first time, but deny her discovery involves coming to know some facts of which she was not already cognizant before her release. Therefore, what she obtained is a discovery of new abilities rather than new facts; her discovery of what it is like to experience color consists merely in her gaining new ability of how to do certain things, but not gaining new factual knowledge. In light of such considerations, Churchland distinguishes between two senses of knowing, "knowing how" and "knowing that", where knowing how refers to abilities and knowing that refers to knowledge of facts. He aims to reinforce this line of objection by appealing to the different locations in which each type of knowledge is represented in the brain, arguing that there is a true, demonstratively physical distinction between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://webcat1.library.ubc.ca:80/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=700224|title=A neurocomputational perspective: the nature of mind and the structure of science|last=Churchland|first=Paul M.|date=1989-01-01|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0262031515|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Levin argues that a novel color experience does in fact yield new factual knowledge, such as "information about the color's similarities and compatibilities with other colors, and its effect on other of our mental states."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levin|first=Janet|date=1986-01-01|title=Could Love Be like a Heatwave?: Physicalism and the Subjective Character of Experience|jstor=4319824|journal=Philosophical Studies|volume=49|issue=2|pages=245–261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tye counters that Mary could have (and would have, given the stipulations of the thought experiment) learned all such facts prior to leaving the room, without needing to experience the color firsthand. For example, Mary could know the fact "red is more like orange than green" without ever experiencing the colors in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://webcat1.library.ubc.ca:80/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=2405834|title=Consciousness, color, and content|last=Tye|first=Michael|date=2000-01-01|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0262201291|series=Representation and mind|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earl Conee objects that having an ability to imagine seeing a color is neither necessary nor sufficient for knowing what it is like to see that color, meaning the ability hypothesis does not capture the nature of the new knowledge Mary acquires upon leaving the room. To show that ability is not necessary, Conee cites the example of someone who is able to see colors when she is looking at them, but who lacks the capacity to imagine colors when she is not. He argues that while staring at something that looks red to her, she would have knowledge of what it is like to see red, even though she lacks the ability to imagine what it is like. In order to show precisely that imaginative abilities are not sufficient for knowing what it is like, Conee introduces the following example: Martha, "who is highly skilled at visualizing an intermediate shade that she has not experienced between pairs of shades that she has experienced...happens not to have any familiarity with the shade known as cherry red". Martha has been told that cherry red is exactly midway between burgundy red and fire red (she has experienced these two shades of red, but not cherry). With this, Martha has the ability to imagine cherry red if she so chooses, but as long as she does not exercise this ability, to imagine cherry red, she does not know what it is like to see cherry red.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conee|first=Earl|date=1994-06-01|title=Phenomenal knowledge|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00048409412345971|journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy|volume=72|issue=2|pages=136–150|doi=10.1080/00048409412345971|issn=0004-8402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One might accept Conee's arguments that imaginative ability is neither necessary nor sufficient for knowing what it is like to see a color, but preserve a version of the ability hypothesis that employs an ability other than imagination. For example, Gertler discusses the option that what Mary gains is not an ability to imagine colors, but an ability to recognize colors by their phenomenal quality.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gertler|first=Brie|date=1999-03-01|title=A Defense of the Knowledge Argument|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1004216101557|journal=Philosophical Studies|language=en|volume=93|issue=3|pages=317–336|doi=10.1023/A:1004216101557|issn=0031-8116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acquaintance hypothesis ===
Due to his dissatisfaction with the ability hypothesis, Earl Conee presents another variant. Conee's acquaintance hypothesis identifies a third category of knowledge, "knowledge by acquaintance of an experience," that is not reducible to factual knowledge nor to knowing-how. He argues that the knowledge Mary actually acquires post-release is acquaintance knowledge. Knowing an experience by acquaintance "requires the person to be familiar with the known entity in the most direct way that it is possible for a person to be aware of that thing". Since "experiencing a quality is the most direct way to apprehend a quality," Mary gains acquaintance with color qualia after release.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Conee thus defends himself against the knowledge argument like this:
# Qualia are physical properties of experiences (and experiences are physical processes). Let Q be such a property. 
# Mary can know all about Q and she can know that a given experience has Q before release, although — before release — she is not acquainted with Q. 
# After release Mary gets acquainted with Q, but she does not acquire any new item of propositional knowledge by getting acquainted with Q (in particular she already knew under what conditions normal perceivers have experiences with the property Q).&lt;ref name="plato" /&gt;
Tye also defends a version of the acquaintance hypothesis that he compares to Conee's, though he clarifies that acquaintance with a color should not be equated to applying a concept to one's color experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://webcat1.library.ubc.ca:80/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=3955331|title=Consciousness revisited: materialism without phenomenal concepts|last=Tye|first=Michael|date=2009-01-01|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262012737|series=Representation and mind|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Conee's account, one can come to know (be acquainted with) a phenomenal quality only by experiencing it, but not by knowing facts about it as Mary did. This is different from other physical objects of knowledge: one comes to know a city, for example, simply by knowing facts about it. Gertler uses this disparity to oppose Conee's account: a dualist who posits the existence of qualia has a way of explaining it, with reference to qualia as different entities than physical objects; while Conee describes the disparity, Gertler argues that his physicalist account does nothing to explain it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== The neural basis of qualia ===
[[V.S. Ramachandran]] and Edward Hubbard of the Center for Brain and Cognition at [[UCSD]] argue that Mary might do one of three things upon seeing a red apple for the first time:
# Mary says she sees nothing but gray.
# She has the "Wow!" response from subjectively experiencing the color for the first time.
# She experiences a form of ''[[blindsight]]'' for color, in which she reports seeing no difference between a red apple and an apple painted gray, but when asked to point to the red apple, she correctly does.

They explain further: "Which of these three possible outcomes will actually occur? We believe we've learned the answer from a [[colorblind]] [[Grapheme-color synesthesia|synesthete]] subject. Much like the theoretical Mary, our colorblind synesthete volunteer cannot see certain hues, because of deficient color receptors. However, when he looks at numbers, his [[synesthesia]] enables him to experience colors in his mind that he has never seen in the real world. He calls these "Martian colors." The fact that color cells (and corresponding colors) can activate in his brain helps us answer the philosophical question: we suggest that the same thing will happen to Mary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramachandran|first=V. S. |author2=Edward M. Hubbard.  |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=more-common-questions-abo-2003-04-14 |title=More Common Questions about Synesthesia |journal=Scientific American |date=April 14, 2003 |accessdate=2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramachandran and Hubbard's contribution is in terms of exploring "the neural basis of qualia" by "using pre-existing, stable differences in the conscious experiences of people who experience synaesthesia compared with those who do not" but, they note that "this still doesn't explain why these particular events are qualia laden and others are not (Chalmers' 'hard problem') but at least it narrows the scope of the problem" (p.&amp;nbsp;25).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramachandran|first=V. S. |author2=Edward M. Hubbard.  |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/imp/jcs/2001/00000008/00000012/1244 |title=Synaesthesia – A window into perception, thought and language |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |date=January 1, 2001 |accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dualist responses ===
Jackson's argument is meant to support dualism, the view that at least some aspects of the mind are non-physical. Nida-Rümelin contends that, because dualism is relatively unpopular among contemporary philosophers, there are not many examples of dualist responses to the knowledge argument; nevertheless, she points out that there are some prominent examples of dualists responding to the Knowledge Argument worth noting.&lt;ref name="plato" /&gt;

Jackson himself went on to reject epiphenomenalism, and dualism altogether. He argues that, because when Mary first sees red, she says "wow", it must be Mary's qualia that causes her to say "wow". This contradicts epiphenomenalism because it involves a conscious state causing an overt speech behavior. Since the Mary's room thought experiment seems to create this contradiction, there must be something wrong with it. Jackson now believes that the physicalist approach (from a perspective of [[Direct and indirect realism|indirect realism]]) provides the better explanation. In contrast to epiphenominalism, Jackson says that the experience of red is entirely contained in the brain, and the experience immediately causes further changes in the brain (e.g. creating memories). This is more [[Consilience|consilient]] with neuroscience's understanding of [[color vision]]. Jackson suggests that Mary is simply discovering a new way for her brain to represent qualities that exist in the world. In a similar argument, philosopher [[Philip Pettit]] likens the case of Mary to patients suffering from [[akinetopsia]], the inability to perceive the motion of objects. If someone were raised in a stroboscopic room and subsequently 'cured' of the akinetopsia, they would not be surprised to discover any new facts about the world (they do, in fact, know that objects move). Instead, their surprise would come from their brain now allowing them to ''see'' this motion.

Despite a lack of dualist responses overall and Jackson's own change of view, there are more recent instances of prominent dualists defending the Knowledge Argument. [[David Chalmers]], one of the most prominent contemporary dualists, considers Jackson's thought experiment to successfully show that materialism is false. Chalmers considers responses along the lines of the "ability hypothesis" objection (described above) to be the most promising objections, but unsuccessful: even if Mary does gain a new ability to imagine or recognize colors, she would also necessarily gain factual knowledge about the colors she now sees, such as the fact of how the experience of seeing red relates to the physical brain states underlying it. He also considers arguments that knowledge of what it is like to see red and of the underlying physical mechanisms are actually knowledge of the same fact, just under a different "mode of presentation," meaning Mary did not truly gain new factual knowledge. Chalmers rejects these, arguing that Mary still necessarily gains new factual knowledge about how the experience and the physical processes relate to one another, i.e. a fact about exactly what kind of experience is caused by those processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://webcat1.library.ubc.ca:80/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=1152375|title=The conscious mind: in search of a fundamental theory|last=Chalmers|first=David John|date=1996-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195105532|series=Philosophy of mind series|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martine Nida-Rümelin|Nida-Rümelin]] defends a complex, though similar, view, involving properties of experience she calls "phenomenal properties."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195171655.003.0013|title=Grasping Phenomenal Properties|last=Nida‐Rümelin|first=Martine|pages=307–338|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195171655.003.0013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''La Voix des Femmes''''' ({{lang-en|'''The Women's Voice'''}}) was a [[Paris]]ian [[feminist]] newspaper, and later an organization dedicated to education and the advancement of women's rights.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/hist255-s01/eponine2/newspaper.html|title=A Feminist Daily Newspaper in France?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.mtholyoke.edu|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper was put together by [[Eugenie Niboyet]] and published daily beginning in 1848 with the fall of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]] and the emergence of the much more lenient [[French Second Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Exiles from European Revolutions|first=Sabine|last=Freitag|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the initial popularity of the newspaper, it soon became an official association with such prominent members as [[Jeanne Deroin]], [[Pauline Roland]], [[Eugenie Niboyet]] and [[Desirée Gay]].  Male collaboration with the newspaper was welcome and among the male contributors was French poet, [[Victor Hugo]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Members of the ''Voix des Femmes'' did not question that a woman's role was inherently maternal or domestic.  Instead, they tried to use the importance of this role as justification for increased financial security, job security, education, property rights, and women's [[suffrage]].{{cn|date=February 2017}} The ''Voix des Femmes'' closed in 1852.

'''''Mari Hakikat''''' ({{lang-gu|મારી હકીકત}}) is the autobiography of [[Narmadashankar Dave]], popularly known as Narmad, a [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] author from [[Surat]] during 19th century India. It was the first autobiography to be written in the Gujarati language.{{efn-ua|Durgaram Mehta had written ''Nityanondh'' in the 1840s, but it was more a personal diary than an attempt at a formal English style autobiography. [[Mahipatram Rupram Nilkanth]] had then written a biography, ''Durgaram Charitra'' (1879) based on the diary.&lt;ref name="Dattax"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amaresh Datta|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: A-Devo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObFCT5_taSgC&amp;pg=PA527|year=1987|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1803-1|page=527}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kusum2016"/&gt;}} Written in 1866, it was published posthumously in 1933 on the centenary of Narmad's birth.&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kusum2016"/&gt;{{efn-ua|Narmad had written his autobiography in 1866 but he had requested it to be published posthumously. It was published in 1933, on his birth centenary. Two autobiographies were published before it, ''Hu Pote'' (1900) by [[Narayan Hemchandra]] and ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth|Satyana Prayogo]]'' (1925-1929) by [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref name="Kusum2016"/&gt;}}

==Origin and publication history==
Narmad wrote ''Mari Hakikat'' in 1866.&lt;ref name="Dave1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dave|first=Narmadashanker Lalshanker|editor=Ramesh M. Shukla|title=Mari Hakikat|url=http://www.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/537875|edition=1|year=1994|publisher=Kavi Narmad Yugavart Trust|location=Surat|pages=5–21, 172|chapter=Preface|language=gu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025050702/http://www.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/537875|archivedate=2016-10-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained his intentions at the start of his autobiography; {{quote|I am not writing this autobiography for anybody else but for myself. For me; it is not for recognition (I am already recognized), money or designation but for the encouragement [to me] in future from the past.&lt;ref name="Dave1994"/&gt;}}&lt;!---''આ હકીકત લખું છ તે કોઈને માટે નહીં, પણ મારે જ માટે- મારે માટે પણ તે ઓળખવાને નહીં (ઓળખાઈ ચુકો છ), દ્રવ્ય પદવિ મેળવવાને નહીં પણ ભૂતનું જોઇ ભવિષ્યમાં ઉત્તેજન મળ્યાં કરે એ માટે.''---&gt;
He added that his life will give some message to people. Narmad was candid and outspoken and he believed that his thoughts and works are exemplar. To give insights in his mind and world around him, he chose to write as openly as possible about events in his life, people connected with those events, his relations with those people and the results of those relationships.&lt;ref name="Dave1994"/&gt;

Narmad had published a collection of his essays as ''Narmagadhya: Book 1'' in 1865. ''Suratni Mukhatesar ni Hakikat'' was published as ''[[Narmagadya]]: Book 2: Issue 1'' in 1866 from page 1 to page 59. He had intended to publish ''Mari Hakikat'' as ''Narmagadya: Book 2: Issue 2,'' but later changed his mind.&lt;ref name="Dave1994"/&gt;

After his death in 1886, his friend [[Navalram Pandya]] published a biography of Narmad, ''[[Kavijivan]]'' (1880) which was based on the autobiography. He wrote that Narmad had only two to five copies printed, which were given to close friends, and had requested it be published only after his death. Natwarlal Desai, his editor and son of another close friend [[Ichharam Desai|Ichchharam Desai]], also corroborated this. But later research found that Narmad had printed 400 copies of the autobiography; it is mentioned in ''Narmakavita'' (1866–67), in which he had included a list of all his books along with the number of published copies of each. Narmad may have destroyed all but a few copies but there has been no firm proof of it.&lt;ref name="Dave1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt;

The limited print copy had 73 pages of two columned [[Paper size|Royal size page]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. It was page number 60 to 132 of ''Narmagadya: Book 2: Issue 2,''  printed by Union Press, owned by his friend Nanabhai Rustomji Ranina. As Narmad's only son Jayshankar died in 1910 without any heir, he had assigned the management of his father's works to his friends, Mulchand Damodardas Mukati and Thakordas Tribhuvandas Tarkasr. They had transferred copyrights of these works to Gujarati Press in 1911.&lt;ref name="Dave1994"/&gt;

[[Kanaiyalal Munshi]] had published a few chapters in ''Gujarat'' magazine in 1926, but stopped when the copyright holder, Gujarati Press objected. Gujarati Press published some excerpts from ''Mari Hakikat'' in the [[Diwali]] editions of ''Gujarati'' in 1930 and 1931, finally publishing the full version in 1933, the birth centenary of Narmad. Later in 1939, they also published ''Uttar Narmad Charitra'' which included some notes and letters as a followup to the autobiography.&lt;ref name="Dave1994"/&gt;

''Mari Hakikat'' is not in continuous prose and includes lots of notes. Narmad had started keeping notes in 1854, and written the first draft based on information told to him by his father and relatives, papers available in his home, his expense book and his memory. He organised all available information into a timeline and filled in gaps with other information. He had described his autobiography as 'incomplete' and a 'draft' and intended to rewrite it at some future date.&lt;ref name="Dave1994"/&gt;

His prime motive for writing was self encouragement. Other motives were to popularize autobiographies in Gujarati, to give insight into his life to his friends and clarify truths about his life and leave a record of them after his death. He had decided to write as truthfully as possible about his life and his relatives, friends and foes. He did not intended to hurt anybody, and later decided not to publish publicly as he intended it only for his own encouragement.

When Gujarati Press closed operations, they deposited one of his limited copies printed in 1866, with proofreading notes by Narmad himself, at M. T. B. College, Surat.&lt;ref name="Dave1994" /&gt;

The first edition published in 1933 had several omissions and misprints. A later edition was edited by [[Dhirubhai Thaker]]. After the Kavi Narmad Yugavart Trust was established they decided to republish Narmad's entire works. They researched original manuscripts, limited copies and earlier editions, also examining all the literature of Narmad and extracting writings and letters that were autobiographical in nature. This critical edition consisting of the autobiography, autobiographical notes and letters was edited by Ramesh M. Shukla and published by the Trust in 1994.&lt;ref name="Dave1994" /&gt;

==Contents of critical edition, 1994==
The critical edition is divided in four sections.&lt;ref name="Dave1994"/&gt;

The first section covers the autobiography written in 1866. It consists of his birth to 1866, divided into 10 subsections, or ''Viram''. All titles and subtitles of the ''Viram''s were given by his editor Natwar Desai.&lt;ref name="Kusum2016"/&gt; It covers his life from 3 September 1833 to 18 September 1866. It covers his birth, his parents and relatives, his education, his formative years, his reformist stand, his rise and career.&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web | title=નર્મદશંકર દવે (Narmadashankar Dave)| website=[[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad]] | url=http://www.gujaratisahityaparishad.com/prakashan/sarjako/savishesh/Savishesh-Narmadashankar-Dave.html | language=gu | accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second section covers essays and notes written by him which are autobiographical in nature. It includes notes and thoughts on his personal life, his family, and his own works. The third section covers letters written to various relatives, friends and people of his time. The fourth section covers appendices which include scans of his and his companions' writings, legal documents, notes and timeline.&lt;ref name="Dave1994"/&gt;

In the beginning of the book Narmad write: {{quote|"The story in the book is incomplete, it is simply a jotting down the notes. Yet in the book I won't write those things which I think improper. But whatever I write will be nothing but truth as known to me, without being bothered about public opinion and my own interest."|Narmad&lt;ref name="Datta1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amaresh Datta|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: K to Navalram|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Ur27mKvc_kC|year=1989|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-260-1804-8|page=2613}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And apparently, he has frankly written about his cowardice, his calf love, his attempts to attract women, his dislike of his contemporary poet [[Dalpatram]] and their clash, his conflict with his father, how he once arranged a musical concert at his residence under depression and spent five hundred rupees for it, his financial crisis, betrayal by friends, his private love affairs, etc. The book gives clear picture of Narmad's personality, his egoism, hypersensitive nature, generosity and extravagance.  There are attempts of self glorification, and attitude of self-righteousness. The language he used has a ting of [[Surat]]i dialect and the style is fully reflective of his personality.&lt;ref name="Datta1989"/&gt;

==Reception==
[[Chandrakant Topiwala]] has highlighted candidness, honesty at the expense of narrative and efforts of introspection as major elements of the autobiography. He has also praised its prose.&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; Dhirubhai Modi has criticised its language without beauty but praised its truthfulness and honesty. He has also praised it for its accuracy and the efforts of writing it. [[Chandravadan Mehta]] gave tribute to author by writing,&lt;ref name="Kusum2016"&gt;{{cite book | last=Pandya | first=Kusum H| title=Gujarati Atmakatha Tena Swarupagat Prashno. Thesis.

Narmad. Your autobiography, even if it is incomplete, or even if it does not accepted in today's [literary] structure or tomorrow's, even if anybody had tried the same before, your [autobiography] has a clank of truth and thats enough. By knowing it, we will celebrate your courageous and honest book in Gujarati literature and will continue to tribute you by reading it.&lt;ref name="Kusum2016"/&gt;}}

[[Gulabdas Broker]] described it as 'very bold, sincere and beautiful autobiography'.&lt;ref name="Broker1977"&gt;{{cite book|last=Broker|first=Gulabdas|authorlink=Gulabdas Broker|title=Narmadashankar|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=HyEKAQAAIAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|location=New Delhi|page=46|oclc=4136864}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Gujarati critic, Vishwanath M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8813">The '''Militant League for German Culture''' (German: ''Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur'', ''KfdK''), was a nationalistic anti-Semitic political society during the [[Weimar Republic]] and the [[Nazi]] era. It was founded in 1928 as the ''Nationalsozialistische Gesellschaft für deutsche Kultur'' (NGDK, National Socialist Society for German Culture') by Nazi ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and remained under his leadership until it was reorganized and renamed to the National Socialist Culture Community (''Nationalsozialistische Kulturgemeinde'') in 1934. Its aim was to make a significant imprint on cultural life in Germany that was based on the aims and objectives of the inner circles of the Nazi Party. Upon its reorganization, it was merged with the ''Deutsche Bühne'' (German Stage), connected with the establishment of the official body for cultural surveillance, the "Dienstelle Rosenberg" (DRbg) and was later known as the [[Amt Rosenberg]].

==Members and followers==
The number of members, who were organized in local chapters, rose from approximately 300 in 25 chapters in April 1929 to about 38,000 in 450 chapters by October 1933. 

The members and supporters included representatives of the extreme right wing of the National Socialist movement. These included anti-Semitic literary historians [[Adolf Bartels]], Ludwig Polland, [[Gustaf Kossinna]], physicist and [[Einstein]]-opponent [[Philipp Lenard]], publishers [[Hugo Bruckmann]] and [[Julius Friedrich Lehmann]], the leaders of the Bayreuth Society [[Winifred Wagner]], Daniela Thode, [[Hans Freiherr von Wolzogen]], the widow of racial ideologist [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], Eva Chamberlain, the composer [[Paul Graener]], the philosophers [[Otto Friedrich Bollnow]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kant.uni-mainz.de/ks/history/leaman.html Die Kant-Studien im Dritten Reich], George Leaman, Bowling Green / Gerd Simon, Tübingen&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eugen Herrigel]],&lt;ref&gt;Die Nazifizierung der Philosophie an der Universität Breslau 1933-1945, von Norbert Kapferer, LIT Verlag, 2002, {{ISBN|3825854515}}&lt;/ref&gt; the poet and later president of the ''Reichsschrifttumskammer'' [[Hanns Johst]]; the architect Paul Schulze-Naumburg, who edited the periodical ''Kunst und Rasse'' [''Art and Race''], and who spoke at many events; Gustav Havemann, a violinist and later leader of the Reichsmusikkammer (who founded and lead a Kampfbund orchestra); the theater director Karl von Schirach; Fritz Kloppe who led ''[[Werwolf]]'', a paramilitary organization; and the theologian and nationalist musicologist [[Fritz Stein]]. [[Othmar Spann]], Austrian political philosopher and a teacher of [[Friedrich Hayek]]. After an ad on April 20, 1933, Edwin Werner, PhD, founded his own association in Passau.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Rosmus: Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 61f&lt;/ref&gt; 

Corporate and organizational members included the Association of German Fraternities [Deutsche Burschenschaften], the German Homeland Association [Deutsche Landsmannschaft], German College Gymnastics Associations [Turnerschaften an deutschen Hochschulen], the Association of German Guilds [Deutsche Gildenschaften], the Association of German Glee Clubs [Deutsche Sängerschaft], the German College Music Society [Sondershäuser Verband], and German College Art Society [Deutscher Hochschulring].

==Publications and political action ==
[[File:Nuremberg Trials defendant Wilhelm Frick in his cell 1945.jpeg|thumb|Frick in his cell, November 1945]]
The Society published the periodical ''Mitteilung des Kampfbundes für deutsche Kultur'' [''Proceedings of the KfdK''] from 1929 to 1931. Under the heading "Signs of the Times" they listed their enemies: [[Erich Kästner]], [[Kurt Tucholsky]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Walter Mehring]], and the Berlin Institute for Sexual Research. Later the most frequently mentioned were [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], the [[Bauhaus|Bauhaus Movement]], [[Emil Nolde]], Karl Hofter, [[Max Beckmann]], and [[Georg Grosz]]. Books by [[Ernst Toller]], [[Arnold Zweig]], [[Jakob Wassermann]], [[Lion Feuchtwanger]], [[Arnolt Bronnen]], [[Leonhard Frank]], [[Emil Ludwig]], and [[Alfred Neumann (writer)|Alfred Neumann]] were dismissed as not properly German. In 1930, the society directed a campaign against [[Ernst Barlach]] and the so-called "hate art" (''Hetzkunst'') of [[Käthe Kollwitz]].

The Society published ''German Culture Watch: Journal of the KfdK'' in October 1932, reprinted in 1933, under the editorship of [[Hans Hinkel]].

Their activities had a nationwide impact. In 1930 [[Wilhelm Frick]], the Nazi Interior and Cultural minister of Thuringia and KdfK regional leader, named [[Hans Severus Ziegler]] of the Schultze-Naumburg firm as director of the Weimar Architecture Institute. He immediately dismissed all practitioners of the Bauhaus style. Frick ordered artworks by "[[degenerate art]]ists" to be removed from the [[Schlossmuseum, Weimar|Schlossmuseum in Weimar]]. These included works by [[Otto Dix]], [[Lyonel Feininger]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Paul Klee]], Barlack, [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Franz Marc]], and [[Emil Nolde]], although the latter was himself a nazi. Works by modernist composers [[Stravinsky]] and [[Hindemith]] were struck from state-subsidized concert programs, and books by [[Erich Maria Remarque]], and films by [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]], [[Pudovkin]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Pabst]] were banned outright.

The KfdK, under Frick's auspices, arranged its first major youth conference on [[Pentecost]] in 1930. It presented Nazi leaders [[Baldur von Schirach]], [[Goebbels]], [[Hermann Göring|Göring]], and [[Walther Darré|Darré]]. Referencing Weimar's "spiritual heroes" a resolution called for "strengthening German military will" and, in reference to the arts, "resistance against all populist harmful influences in the area of theater, literature and fine arts, and against alien architecture." The following Pentecost in 1931, saw a youth and cultural meeting in Potsdam, where Rosenberg gave a lectures on "Blood and Honor," and "Race and Personality" and Göring on the theme "Readiness to fight to protect our culture."

[[File:Three buffered mults - Today's completed builds... (2014-12-18 12.32.13 by c-g.).jpg|thumb|Custom built mult circuits and panels]]
A '''mult box''' is "a metal box with multiple outputs of a single audio source (one microphone connected to twenty jacks so that twenty people can record that microphone)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euonline.org/members/continui/audioendearment/index.html |publisher=NPR |first= Mark |last=Greenhouse |title=Audio Terms of Endearment |date= July 7, 2007 |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mult box is sometimes called a '[[press box]]', but that term is usually reserved for the sports media's section of an arena. It may also be called a '''press mult box''' or '''press bridge'''.&lt;ref name=View&gt;{{cite web|url=http://garypalamara.com/Articles_Press%20Conference%202.htm|last=Palamara|first=Gary|publisher=Radio World|title=The View From the Back of the Room - II: Tips for Reporters and Others Covering Press Events|date=June 20, 2007|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[sound engineer]] connects several [[microphone]]s to allow all of them to get clean, high-quality audio.&lt;ref name=View /&gt;

Reporters use a mult box frequently at [[press conference]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gearslutz.com/board/remote-possibilities-acoustic-music-location-recording/331423-mult-box-set-up-press-feed.html |title=Mult Box Set Up for Press Feed |date=September 29, 2008 |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially when politicians give such interviews in small spaces, where not all the reporters in a [[press pool]] can access the interviewee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/rick-santorums-way-win-run-campaign-shoestring-budget-162734670--abc-news.html |publisher=Yahoo News |authors=Shushanna Walsh and Michael Falcone |title=Rick Santorum's Way to Win? Run a Campaign on a Shoestring Budget |date=February 15, 2012 |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
A whole set of [[etiquette]] and [[mores]] has developed amongst [[journalist]]s governing the use of mult boxes.  Because it is often difficult to get a good [[sound recording]] from a [[Dictation machine|digital recorder]] for later broadcast or [[:wikt:transcribe|transcription]] for newspaper reporting, journalists have developed informal rules for their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsjournalists.com/forum/index.php?topic=57499.0|author="Johnny Dangerously" ([[pseudonym]])|title=Mult box procedure and etiquette|publisher=[[Sportsjournalists.com]] |date=June 16, 2008|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the media should treat the sound engineer well, because while reporters can be selfish and competitive with each other, and the equipment can go wrong in many ways, the engineer allows all of them to get a good signal.&lt;ref name=View /&gt;  It is also extremely important to show up early to press conferences; this "early bird gets the worm" habit allows one to test equipment, to avoid problems caused by the chaos of most press conferences, and to work cooperatively with the engineer.&lt;ref name=View /&gt;

The [[NCAA]] has a specific, written policy on the use of mult boxes for all NCAA championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.turner.ncaa.com/dr/ncaa/ncaa/release/sites/default/files/files/NewsMediaPress%20Conferences.pdf|author=unknown|title=NCAA Championship (News, Media and Press Conferences) |publisher=[[NCAA]]|year=2016|accessdate=Oct 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
[[United States]] government agencies usually provide a mult box for media use at press conferences.&lt;ref&gt;See ''e.g.'', http://www.ntsb.gov/news/2012/120323.html [[NTSB]] press release; accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, they are not always consistent; the [[United States Department of Energy]] sometimes makes a mult box available, but then does not make a "media avail with speakers"; yet at other times does ''not'' allow a mult box but follows it up with a "press availability".&lt;ref name=Energy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/articles/tomorrow-secretary-chu-visit-south-carolina-attend-small-business-summit-highlight-clean|publisher=United States Department of Energy|title=TOMORROW: Secretary Chu to Visit South Carolina to Attend Small Business Summit, Highlight Clean Energy Innovations With Rep. Clyburn (press release)|date=August 22, 2011|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some state government agencies or courts also may provide such equipment for free to media, but charge a fee to rent it for private events held on state property.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', in [[Ohio]], [http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/PIO/MediaRequestInfo/default.asp [[Supreme Court of Ohio]]'s Guidelines for News Organizations Broadcasting, Televising, Recording and Photographing Sessions of Court], [http://www.ohiostatehouse.org/events/YourEvent/index.aspx Ohio Statehouse's webpage on "Your Event at the Statehouse"], and [http://www.ohiostatehouse.org/Communications/Media/UseOfTapeRecorders.aspx Ohio Statehouse's webpage on "Use of Tape Recorders at the Ohio Statehouse For News Media and Others"]; all accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some colleges and universities provide the use of a mult box ''gratis'' to media who need it to record large academic events such as [[Graduation|commencement]], speaker, or [[funeral]],&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', [http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2012/05/commencement-events-may-10-11-at-vanderbilt-university/ [[Vanderbilt University]] press release], [http://www.cianewswire.com/2012/05/mediaalert_hfhk.html [[The Culinary Institute of America]] press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310024625/http://www.cianewswire.com/2012/05/mediaalert_hfhk.html |date=2013-03-10 }}, and [http://www.vt.edu/in-memoriam/dec12-service.html [[Virginia Tech]] press information web page] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120805200257/http://www.vt.edu/in-memoriam/dec12-service.html |date=2012-08-05 }}; both accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but charge for leasing to certain organizations.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', [http://www.css.washington.edu/Rental-List [[University of Washington]] Classroom Support Services "Rental List" web page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620195509/http://www.css.washington.edu/Rental-List |date=2010-06-20 }} and [http://www.css.washington.edu/Fee-Categories University of Washington web page listign which groups are charged what rates]; see also [http://www.nyu.edu/campusmedia/events/rates.html [[New York University]] web page for Events Media Services Rates] and [http://www.nyu.edu/campusmedia/events/policies.html New York University policies web page]; all accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Larger houses of worship, such as a [[basilica]] or [[cathedral]], may provide a mult box for certain religious services, but not others, depending on their policies and the nature of the [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] or [[eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', [http://archphila.org/press%20releases/pr001946.htm [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia]] press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703053610/http://archphila.org/press%20releases/pr001946.htm |date=2012-07-03 }}; accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Large media events, such as the [[Grammy Awards]], [[Alamo Bowl]], etc., often provide a mult box for media at their press conferences as a convenience.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'' [http://www.alamobowl.com/main/media_schedule.php Valero Alamo Bowl media schedule &amp; info web page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414130344/http://www.alamobowl.com/main/media_schedule.php |date=2012-04-14 }} and [http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/apr-05-2012-400-am Grammy Awards press release]; both accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Installation==
A mult box can be an extraordinarily expensive piece of audio-visual equipment to purchase,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} so many organizations rent them from a communications company or government agency.  Larger venues may make them available to the media for free, but rent them to private parties.

In 2011, the [[Foreign_relations_of_the_African_Union#Diplomatic_missions|United States Mission to the African Union]] donated a [[state of the art]] mult box to the cash-starved [[African Union]] in a formal ceremony, in which they also presented new [[intern]]s who will be trained to use it.&lt;ref name=AU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usau.usmission.gov/-mult-box-grant-to-the-auc-09/22/11.html|last=|first=|publisher=United States Mission to the African Union|title=United States Mission to the African Union donates Audio Visual Broadcast Media Mult Box to the AUC|date=September 22, 2011|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mural''' is any piece of artwork painted or applied directly on a wall, ceiling or other permanent surface. A distinguishing characteristic of mural painting is that the architectural elements of the given space are harmoniously incorporated into the picture.

Some wall paintings are painted on large canvases, which are then attached to the wall (e.g., with [[marouflage]]). Whether these works can be accurately called "murals" is a subject of some controversy in the art world,{{Who|date=August 2014}} but the technique has been in common use since the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Willsdon2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clare A.

==History==
[[File:Meister des Mahâjanaka Jâtaka 001.jpg|thumb|[[Jataka]] tales from the [[Ajanta caves]], 7th century]]
Murals of sorts date to [[Upper Paleolithic]] times such as the paintings in the [[Chauvet Cave]] in [[Ardèche]] department of southern [[France]] (around 30,000 BC). Many ancient murals have been found within [[ancient Egypt]]ian tombs (around 3150&amp;nbsp;BC),&lt;ref&gt;Only after 664 BC are dates secure. See [[Egyptian chronology]] for details.{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/chronology/index.html|title=Chronology|accessdate=2008-03-25|publisher=Digital Egypt for Universities, University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan palaces]] (Middle period III of the Neopalatial period, 1700–1600 BC) and in [[Pompeii]] (around 100 BC – AD 79).

During the Middle Ages murals were usually executed on dry [[Plasterwork|plaster]] (secco). The huge collection of [[Kerala mural painting]] dating from the 14th century are examples of [[fresco secco]].&lt;ref&gt;Menachery, George (ed.): ''The St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India'', Vol. II, 1973; Menachery, George (ed.): ''Indian Church History Classics, Vol. I, The Nazranies'', Saras, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Pallikalile Chitrabhasangal'|url=http://www.nazraney.com/Pazhama--MAY--13_file.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620235620/http://www.nazraney.com/Pazhama--MAY--13_file.pdf|archivedate=2015-06-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, circa 1300, the technique of painting of frescos on wet plaster was reintroduced and led to a significant increase in the quality of mural painting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/8526688/Mural_Painting_as_a_Medium_Technique_Representation_and_Liturgy Péter Bokody, ''Mural Painting as a Medium: Technique, Representation and Liturgy'', in ''Image and Christianity: Visual Media in the Middle Ages'', Pannonhalma Abbey, 2014, 136-151]&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the term became more well-known with the [[Mexican muralism]] art movement ([[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros|David Siqueiros]] and [[José Clemente Orozco|José Orozco]]). There are many different [[Painting style|styles]] and techniques. The best-known is probably ''[[fresco]]'', which uses water-soluble paints with a damp [[Whitewash|lime wash]], a rapid use of the resulting mixture over a large surface, and often in parts (but with a sense of the whole). The colors lighten as they dry.  The ''[[marouflage]]'' method has also been used for millennia.

Murals today are painted in a variety of ways, using oil or water-based media. The styles can vary from abstract to ''[[trompe-l'œil]]'' (a French term for "fool" or "trick the eye"). Initiated by the works of mural artists like [[Graham Rust]] or [[Rainer Maria Latzke]] in the 1980s, [[trompe-l'oeil]] painting has experienced a renaissance in private and public buildings in Europe.
Today, the beauty of a wall mural has become much more widely available with a technique whereby a painting or photographic image is transferred to poster paper or [[canvas]] which is then pasted to a wall surface ''(see [[wallpaper]], [[Frescography]])'' to give the effect of either a hand-painted mural or realistic scene.

==Technique==

[[File:Mari fresco Investiture Zimri Lim 0210.jpg|thumb|right|The 18th-century BC fresco of the ''[[Investiture of Zimrilim]]'' discovered at the [[Royal Palace of Mari|Royal Palace]] of ancient [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in [[Syria]] ]]

In the history of mural several methods have been used:

''[[Fresco|A fresco]]'' painting, from the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''affresco'' which derives from the adjective ''fresco'' ("fresh"), describes a method in which the paint is applied on [[plaster]] on walls or ceilings. The ''[[buon fresco]]'' technique consists of painting in [[pigment]] mixed with [[water]] on a thin layer of wet, fresh, [[Mortar (masonry)#Lime mortar|lime mortar]] or [[plaster]]. The pigment is then absorbed by the wet plaster; after a number of hours, the plaster dries and reacts with the air: it is this chemical reaction which fixes the pigment particles in the plaster. After this the painting stays for a long time up to centuries in fresh and brilliant colors.

''[[Fresco-secco]]'' painting is done on dry plaster (''secco'' is "dry" in Italian).  The pigments thus require a binding medium, such as [[egg (food)|egg]] ([[tempera]]), glue or [[oil painting|oil]] to attach the pigment to the wall.

''Mezzo-fresco'' is painted on nearly-dry plaster, and was defined by the sixteenth-century author Ignazio Pozzo as "firm enough not to take a thumb-print" so that the pigment only penetrates slightly into the plaster. By the end of the sixteenth century this had largely displaced the ''buon fresco'' method, and was used by painters such as [[Gianbattista Tiepolo]] or [[Michelangelo]].  This technique had, in reduced form, the advantages of ''a secco'' work.

In [[Greco-Roman]] times, mostly [[encaustic painting|encaustic]] colors applied in a cold state were used.&lt;ref&gt;Selim Augusti. La tecnica dell'antica pittura parietale pompeiana.

[[Tempera]] painting is one of the oldest known methods in mural painting. In tempera, the pigments are bound in an albuminous medium such as [[egg yolk]] or [[egg white]] diluted in water.

In 16th-century Europe, [[oil painting]] on canvas arose as an easier method for mural painting. The advantage was that the artwork could be completed in the artist's studio and later transported to its destination and there attached to the wall or ceiling. Oil paint may be a less satisfactory medium for murals because of its lack of brilliance in colour. Also the pigments are yellowed by the binder or are more easily affected by atmospheric conditions. The canvas itself is more subject to rapid deterioration than a plaster ground.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}
Different muralists tend to become experts in their preferred medium and application, whether that be oil paints, emulsion or acrylic paints&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=As used by Eric Cumini Murals|url=http://www.cuminitrompeloeil.com|publisher=Eric Cumini|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied by brush, roller or airbrush/aerosols. Clients will often ask for a particular style and the artist may adjust to the appropriate technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toronto Mural Painting|url=http://torontomuralists.ca/toronto-mural-painting|work=Technical aspects of mural painting|publisher=Toronto Muralists|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A consultation usually leads to a detailed design and layout of the proposed mural with a price quote that the client approves before the muralist starts on the work. The area to be painted can be gridded to match the design allowing the image to be scaled accurately step by step. In some cases the design is projected straight onto the wall and traced with pencil before painting begins. Some muralists will paint directly without any prior sketching, preferring the spontaneous technique.

Once completed the mural can be given coats of varnish or protective acrylic glaze to protect the work from UV rays and surface damage.

In modern, quick form of muralling, young enthusiasts also use POP clay mixed with glue or bond to give desired models on a canvas board. The canvas is later set aside to let the clay dry. Once dried, the canvas and the shape can be painted with your choice of colors and later coated with varnish.

[[File:Comersee Spalier rgb.jpg|thumb|[[Computer aided mural|CAM]] designed [[Frescography]] by Rainer Maria Latzke, digitally printed on canvas]]

As an alternative to a hand-painted or airbrushed mural, digitally printed murals can also be applied to surfaces.  Already existing murals can be photographed and then be reproduced in near-to-original quality.

The disadvantages of pre-fabricated murals and decals are that they are often mass-produced and lack the allure and exclusivity of an original artwork. They are often not fitted to the individual wall sizes of the client and their personal ideas or wishes can not be added to the mural as it progresses. The [[Frescography]] technique, a digital manufacturing method ([[Computer aided mural|CAM]]) invented by [[Rainer Maria Latzke]] addresses some of the personalisation and size restrictions.

Digital techniques are commonly used in advertisements. A "wallscape" is a large advertisement on or attached to the outside wall of a building.  Wallscapes can be painted directly on the wall as a mural, or printed on vinyl and securely attached to the wall in the manner of a [[billboard]]. Although not strictly classed as murals, large scale printed media are often referred to as such. Advertising murals were traditionally painted onto buildings and shops by sign-writers, later as large scale poster [[billboards]].

[[File:SBmural.jpg|thumb|left|The [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]] mural]]
Murals are important in that they bring art into the public sphere. Due to the size, cost, and work involved in creating a mural, muralists must often be commissioned by a sponsor. Often it is the local government or a business, but many murals have been paid for with grants of [[patronage]]. For artists, their work gets a wide audience who otherwise might not set foot in an art gallery.  A city benefits by the beauty of a work of art.

Murals can be a relatively effective tool of social emancipation or achieving a political goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/politically-relevant-street-art-has-long-tradition-latin-america |title= Seizing public space |author= Sebastián Vargas |publisher= D+C, development and cooperation|accessdate= 21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murals have sometimes been created against the law, or have been commissioned by local bars and coffeeshops. Often, the visual effects are an enticement to attract public attention to social issues.
State-sponsored public art expressions, particularly murals, are often used by [[totalitarian]] regimes as a tool of propaganda. However, despite the propagandist character of that works, some of them still have an artistic value.

Murals can have a dramatic impact whether consciously or subconsciously on the attitudes of passers by, when they are added to areas where people live and work. It can also be argued that the presence of large, public murals can add aesthetic improvement to the daily lives of residents or that of employees at a corporate venue.

Other world-famous murals can be found in [[Mexico]], [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Belfast]], [[Derry]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Cuba]] and in [[India]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100314123543/http://rpmurals.home.att.net/]  They have functioned as an important means of communication for members of socially, ethnically and racially divided communities in times of conflict. They also proved to be an effective tool in establishing a dialogue and hence solving the cleavage in the long run.
The [[India]]n state [[Kerala]] has exclusive [[murals]]. These [[Kerala mural painting]] are on walls of [[Hindu]] [[temples]]. They can be dated from 9th century AD.

The [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]] murals of the [[Maya civilization]] in [[Guatemala]], are the oldest example of this art in [[Mesoamerica]] and are dated at 300 BC.

Many rural towns have begun using murals to create tourist attractions in order to boost economic income. [[Colquitt, Georgia]], is one such town. Colquitt was chosen to host the 2010 Global Mural Conference. The town has more than twelve murals completed, and will host the Conference along with [[Dothan, Alabama]], and [[Blakely, Georgia]]. In the summer of 2010, Colquitt will begin work on their Icon Mural.

The [[Mexican Muralism|Mexican mural]] movement in the 1930s brought a new prominence to murals as a social and political tool. [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Orozco]] and [[David Siqueiros]] were the most famous artists of the movement. Between 1932 and 1940, Rivera also painted murals in  [[San Francisco]], [[Detroit]], and [[New York City]]. In 1933, he completed a famous series of twenty-seven fresco panels entitled ''[[Detroit Industry]]'' on the walls of an inner court at the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diego Rivera|url=http://www.abcgallery.com/R/rivera/rivera.html|publisher=Olga's Gallery|accessdate=2007-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[McCarthyism]] of the 1950s, a [[:file:Diego Rivera Mural Sign.jpg|large sign]] was placed in the courtyard defending the artistic merit of the murals while attacking his politics as "detestable."

In 1948, the Colombian government hosted the IX Pan-American Conference to establish the [[Marshall plan]] for the Americas. The director of the OEA and the Colombian government commissioned master [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]], to paint a mural in the Colombian congress building to commemorate the event. Martinez decided to make it about the [[Congress of Cúcuta|Cúcuta Congress]], and painted [[Simón Bolívar|Bolívar]] in front of [[Francisco de Paula Santander|Santander]], making liberals upset; so, due to the murder of Jorge Elieser Gaitan the mobs of el [[bogotazo]] tried to burn the capitol, but the Colombian Army stopped them. Years later, in the 1980s, with liberals in charge of the Congress, they passed a resolution to turn the whole chamber in the Elliptic Room 90 degrees to put the main mural on the side and commissioned [[Alejandro Obregon]] to paint a non-partisan mural in the [[surrealist]] style.

[[Northern Ireland]] contains some of the most famous political murals in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Rapp and Markus Rhomberg: Seeking a Neutral Identity in Northern Ireland´s Political Wall Paintings.

In: Machin, D. (Ed.) Visual Communication Reader. De Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times, many murals are non-sectarian, concerning political and social issues such as racism and environmentalism, and many are completely apolitical, depicting children at play and scenes from everyday life. (See [[Northern Irish murals]].)

A not political, but social related mural covers a wall in an old building, once a prison, at the top of a cliff in Bardiyah, in Libya.  It was painted and signed by the artist in April 1942, weeks before his death on the first day of the [[First Battle of El Alamein]].  Known as the [[Bardia Mural]], it was created by English artist, private [[John Frederick Brill]].&lt;ref name=" Commonwealth War Graves Commission"&gt;

In 1961 [[East Germany]] began to erect a wall between East and [[West Berlin]], which became famous as the [[Berlin Wall]]. While on the East Berlin side painting was not allowed, artists painted on the Western side of the Wall from the 80s until the fall of the Wall in 1989.

Many unknown and known artists such as [[Thierry Noir]] and [[Keith Haring]] painted on the Wall, the "World's longest [[canvas]]". The sometimes detailed artwork were often painted over within hours or days. On the Western side the Wall was not protected, so everybody could paint on the Wall. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the Eastern side of the Wall became also a popular "canvas" for many mural and [[graffiti]] artists.
[[Orgosolo]], in [[Sardinia]], is a most important center of [[murals]] [[politics]].

It is also common for mural graffiti be used as a memoir. In the book "Somebody Told Me," [[Rick Bragg]] writes about a series of communities, mainly located in New York, that have walls dedicated to the people who died.&lt;ref&gt;Bragg, Rick. ''Somebody Told Me: The Newspaper Stories of Rick Bragg''. New York: Vintage Books, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; These memorials, both written word and mural style, provide the deceased to be present in the communities in which they lived. Bragg states that the "murals have woven themselves in the fabric of the neighborhoods, and the city." These memorials remind people of the deaths caused by inner city violence.

==Contemporary interior design==

===Traditional===
[[File:Forestmural.jpg|thumb|left|Forest mural by ''One Red Shoe'' in private home, England 2007]]
Many people like to express their individuality by commissioning an artist to paint a mural in their home. This is not an activity exclusively for owners of large houses. A mural artist is only limited by the fee and therefore the time spent on the painting; dictating the level of detail; a simple mural can be added to the smallest of walls.

Private commissions can be for dining rooms, bathrooms, living rooms or, as is often the case- children's bedrooms. A child's room can be transformed into the 'fantasy world' of a [[forest]] or [[racing track]], encouraging imaginative play and an awareness of art.

The current trend for feature walls has increased commissions for muralists in the UK. A large hand-painted mural can be designed on a specific theme, incorporate personal images and elements and may be altered during the course of painting it. The personal interaction between client and muralist is often a unique experience for an individual not usually involved in the arts.

In the 1980s, illusionary wall painting experienced a renaissance in private homes. The reason for this revival in interior design could, in some cases be attributed to the reduction in living space for the individual. Faux architectural features as well as natural scenery and views can have the effect of 'opening out' the walls. Densely built up areas of housing may also contribute to people's feelings of being cut off from nature in its free form. A mural commission of this sort may be an attempt by some people to re-establish a balance with nature.

Commissions of murals in schools, hospitals and retirement homes can achieve a pleasing and welcoming atmosphere in these caring institutions. Murals in other public buildings, such as [[public houses]] are also common.

===Graffiti-style===
[[File:Acehotel-002023.jpg|thumb|right|Mint&amp;Serf at [[Ace Hotel]], New York City]][[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[27 Club Graffiti in Tel Aviv]] celebrating personal expression]]
Recently, [[graffiti]] and street art have played a key role in contemporary wall painting. Such graffiti/street artists as [[Keith Haring]], [[Shepard Fairey]], [[Above (artist)|Above]], [[1134nyc|Mint&amp;Serf]], [[Futura 2000]], [[Os Gemeos]], and [[Faile (artist collective)|Faile]] among others have successfully transcended their street art aesthetic beyond the walls of urban landscape and onto walls of private and corporate clients. As graffiti/street art became more mainstream in the late 1990s, youth oriented brands such as Nike and Red Bull, with Wieden Kennedy, have turned to graffiti/street artists to decorate walls of their respective offices. This trend continued through 2000's with graffiti/street art gaining more recognition from art institutions worldwide.

===Ethnic===
[[File:Wall_murals_Rajasthani_motif.jpg |thumb|left|200px|Rajasthani motif mural by Kakshyaachitra, Mumbai 2014]]
Many home owners choose to display the traditional art and culture of their society or events from their history in their homes. Ethnic murals have become an important form of interior decoration. [[Warli painting]] murals are becoming a preferred mode of wall decor in India. Warli painting is an ancient Indian art form in which the tribal people used to depict different phases of their life on the walls of their mud houses.

==Tile==
[[File:Azulejos Parque Eduardo VII-2.jpg|thumb|Panel of glazed tiles by Jorge Colaço (1922) depicting an episode from the battle of [[Aljubarrota]] (1385) between the Portuguese and [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] armies.  A piece of public art in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]].]]
Tile murals are murals made out of stone, ceramic, porcelain, glass and or metal tiles that are installed within, or added onto the surface of an existing wall. They are also inlaid into floors. Mural tiles are painted, glazed, sublimation printed (as described below) or more traditionally cut or broken into pieces. Unlike the traditional painted murals described above, tile murals are always made with the use of tiles.

Mosaic murals are made by combining small 1/4" to 2" size pieces of colorful stone, ceramic, or glass tiles which are then laid out to create a picture. Modern day technology has allowed commercial mosaic mural makers to use computer programs to separate photographs into colors that are automatically cut and glued onto sheets of mesh creating precise murals fast and in large quantities.

The azulejo ({{IPA-pt|ɐzuˈleʒu}}, {{IPA-es|aθuˈlexo}}) refers to a typical form of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] or [[Spain|Spanish]] painted, [[tin-glazing|tin-glazed]], [[ceramic]] [[tile]]work. They have become a typical aspect of [[Culture of Portugal|Portuguese culture]], manifesting without interruption during five centuries, the consecutive trends in art.

Azulejos can be found inside and outside [[church (building)|church]]es, [[palace]]s, ordinary houses and even [[railway station]]s or [[subway station]]s.

They were not only used as an [[ornament (architecture)|ornamental art]] form, but also had a specific functional capacity like [[temperature control]] in homes. Many azulejos chronicle major historical and cultural aspects of [[Portuguese history]].

Custom-printed tile murals can be produced using digital images for kitchen splashbacks, wall displays, and flooring. Digital photos and artwork can be resized and printed to accommodate the desired size for the area to be decorated. Custom tile printing uses a variety of techniques including dye sublimation and ceramic-type laser toners. The latter technique can yield fade-resistant custom tiles which are suitable for long term exterior exposure.

:''Not to be confused with the same artist's [[Penitent Magdalene (Titian, 1533)|1531 version]] of the same subject.''
The '''''Penitent Magdalene''''' is a 1565 oil painting by [[Titian]] of saint [[Mary Magdalene]], now in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Unlike his 1531 version of the same subject, Titian has covered Mary's nudity and introduced a vase, an open book and a skull as a [[memento mori]]. Its colouring is more mature than the earlier work, using colours harmonising with character. In the background the sky is bathed in the rays of the setting sun, with a dark rock contrasting with the brightly lit figure of Mary.

'''''Portrait of Professor Benjamin H. Rand''''' is an 1874 painting by [[Thomas Eakins]]. It is [[oil painting|oil]] on [[canvas]] and depicts [[Benjamin H. Rand]], a doctor at [[Jefferson Medical College]] who taught Eakins anatomy. In the painting, Rand is reading a book while petting a cat.

The portrait was the first Eakins made of someone outside his family.&lt;ref name="adams"&gt;Adams, Henry (2005). ''Eakins Revealed: The Secret Life of an American Artist.'' Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-515668-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a prelude to what he considered his most important painting, ''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' (1875). Rand donated it to Jefferson Medical College when he retired.

It was purchased by [[Alice L. Walton]] for an estimated US$20 million in April 2007, to be housed at the [[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art]].&lt;ref name="vogel"&gt;Vogel, Carol (April 12, 2007). Philadelphia School Sells a Second Eakins. ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Real Husbands of Hollywood''''' (abbreviated '''''RHOH''''') was an American [[reality television]] parody on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] which debuted on January 15, 2013.&lt;ref name=info&gt;{{cite web|title="Real Husbands of Hollywood" and "Second Generation Wayans" to Premiere Tuesday, January 15 on BET|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/11/28/real-husbands-of-hollywood-and-second-generation-wayans-to-premiere-tuesday-january-15-on-bet-645515/20121128bet01/|publisher=thefutoncritic|accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The series was co-created by comedian Kevin Hart, and follows the daily lives of him and other married celebrities, each playing a fictionalized version of themselves, as they venture through their [[wikt:surreal|surreal]] life in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BET Networks Unveils New Programming at 2012 Upfront Presentation|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/04/12/bet-networks-unveils-new-programming-at-2012-upfront-presentation-999101/20120412bet01/|accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the initial cast include: [[Boris Kodjoe]], [[Nelly]], [[Duane Martin]], [[J.B. Smoove]], [[Nick Cannon]], Oliver (Hart's assistant, played by James Davis), and [[Robin Thicke]], who did not return for the second season due to his music career, though Hart has stated that the door is open for Thicke to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Apr 7, 2013 |url=http://blackamericaweb.com/115037/video-kevin-hart-explains-why-robin-thicke-left-real-husbands/ |title=Kevin Hart Explains Why Robin Thicke Left 'Real Husbands' |publisher=Black America Web |date=2013-04-07 |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series is intentionally filmed in a style similar to [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]]'s ''[[The Real Housewives]]''. Episodes often hinge on the "real" Kevin Hart's desperately unsuccessful attempts to climb Hollywood's celebrity social ladder (which always backfire in humiliating ways), and the character's barely-hidden jealousy of his more successful celebrity friends. A sneak peek was shown as a segment during the [[2012 BET Awards]] and the official promo was released in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Berkshire |first=Geoff |title=BET's 'Real Husbands of Hollywood' with Nick Cannon, 'Second Generation Wayans' get January premieres |url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2012/11/bets-real-husbands-of-hollywood-with-nick-cannon-second-generation-wayans-get-january-premieres.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130210022/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2012/11/bets-real-husbands-of-hollywood-with-nick-cannon-second-generation-wayans-get-january-premieres.html |archivedate=November 30, 2012 |publisher=[[Zap2it]] |department=From Inside the Box (blog) |access-date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Searchlight on Harbor Entrance, Santiago de Cuba''''' is an early 20th century painting by American artist [[Winslow Homer]]. It is currently (2018) in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11136 |title=Winslow Homer &amp;#124; Searchlight on Harbor Entrance, Santiago de Cuba |website=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Executed in oil on canvas from sketches made by Homer in 1895, the painting depicts two cannon atop [[Castillo de San Pedro de la Roca]], also known as Morro castle, a Spanish built fortress on the island of Cuba. The fort played a role in the decisive [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]] in 1898, in which the United States Navy destroyed a Spanish fleet sheltering there. The image was painted after the event received much publicity in 1901 as a court of enquiry strove to apportion credit to the American commanders involved.

The work is on view at the Metropolitan in Gallery 767.

The '''Sopo Archangels'''  (Arcángeles de Sopó) is a famous collection of oil paintings from the [[Colombia]]n [[Spanish Empire|colonial period]] which is located in the Church of the Divine Savior in the Colombian municipality of [[Sopó]].

This [[art collection]]  has an important historic value.  The [[Archangel]]s  are believed to be  painted around 1650, but the artist remains unknown.  Some art experts believe that the paintings are from Baltasar de Figueroa, others point to the [[Ecuador]]ian  painter Miguel de Santiago. A third theory indicates the [[Bogotá|Bogota]]n painter Bernabe de Posadas.  

The national Ministry of Culture and the Board of Colonial Art developed a restoration program for the pieces, which have various degrees of damage. Twelve canvas of 2.38 x 1.67 meters depict eleven archangels, plus the [[Guardian Angel]]. Each piece contains the [[Hebraic]] name of the angel and the Spanish language description:

&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Baraquel.jpg|Baraquel – Blessing of God: The archangel of virtue

'''Southwark Street''' is a major street in [[Bankside]] in the [[London Borough of Southwark]], in [[London]] England, just south of the [[River Thames]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londontown.com/LondonStreets/southwark_street_553.html                                London guide to Southwark Street, SE1], LondonTown.com.&lt;/ref&gt; It runs between [[Blackfriars Road]] to the west and [[Borough High Street]] to the east. It also connects the access routes for [[London Bridge]], [[Southwark Bridge]] and [[Blackfriars Bridge]]. At the eastern end to the north is [[Borough Market]]. 

The road forms part of the A3200, which continues with [[Stamford Street]] to the west. 

== History ==

In April 1856, the [[St Saviour's District (Metropolis)|St Saviour's District Board]] petitioned the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] to create a new street to run between the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] terminus at [[London Bridge station]] and the [[West End of London|West End]].&lt;ref&gt;Sir Howard Roberts and Walter H. Godfrey (editors), [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=65327 Southwark Street], ''Survey of London: volume 22: Bankside (the parishes of St. Saviour and Christchurch Southwark)'', chapter 15, page 90, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; The street was the first to be made by the Board and was completed in 1864. It was driven across a densely occupied part of the parish and crosses older roads and streets which created oddly shaped plots for redevelopment. Its junction with Borough High Street is so gently curved that the transition between the streets leads to confusion and imprecision as to which is which and the street numbering and lack of a street name plate compounds this, the break between them occurs at the junction with Bedale Street on the north-side but at the south-side the street does not begin until after the 'fork' opposite Stoney Street, some 130 metres to the west. Under the street, a tunnel was constructed with side passages to carry utilities such as gas, water, and drainage pipes, together with [[telegraph]] wires for communication. This was an advanced feature for the time. 

[[File:South facade of Borough market on Southwark Street - geograph.org.uk - 1522143.jpg|thumb|South facade of Borough Market on Southwark Street]]
During the first decade of the street's existence, many large commercial buildings were built along the street. The Hop Exchange, of 1874, is the most notable building at the northern side filling most of the quadrant formed by the street and the railway viaduct. Built in the 1870s, the former [[Menier Chocolate Factory]] factory on Southwark Street was converted to an arts complex that incorporates an [[art gallery]], [[restaurant]], and [[theatre]], opening in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.menierchocolatefactory.com/ Menier Chocolate Factory].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1932 Borough Market built a formal gateway with administrative offices at Nos 6 and 8. In 1958 the Trustees erected a small office building at the junction with Stoney Street 'St Margaret's House'. At No 110, the western-end of the street, is the headquarters of IPC Media at the 'Blue Fin Building' completed in 2007.

Under the railway bridge carrying trains to Blackfriars Station from the south some urban art work has been placed on the south-side, whilst on the north-side the word 'Bankside' has been placed in very large lettering occupying most of the wall against the pavement. This is part of the area and tourist branding as the relationship with the ancient district of [[Bankside]] is tenuous, the most that can be said is that Southwark Street defines the southernmost limit of Bankside.

The building on the south-west corner of the junction with Great Guildford Street is, unusually, numbered 59½.

[[Ian Davenport]]s' 2006 painting ''[[Poured Lines]]'' is displayed under the rail bridge at the western end of Southwark Street. It is the largest painting to be publicly displayed outdoors in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=BBC06&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/5315186.stm|title=The big picture|date=5 September 2006|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3122">'''The Book Collector''' is a [[London]] based journal that deals with all aspects of the book.

It is published quarterly and exists in both paper and digital form. It prints independent opinions on subjects ranging from typography to national heritage policy, from medieval libraries to modern first editions. It has run series on Unfamiliar Libraries, Literary and Scientific Autographs, Author Societies, Contemporary Collectors and many other subjects.

== History ==
An earlier series that preceded the Book Collector, was the ''Book Handbook''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Horrox, Reginald, (ed.) | title=Book handbook : an illustrated guide to old and rare books | publication-date=1951 | publisher=Berks | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/13274412 | accessdate=23 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
''The Book Collector'' was launched by the novelist [[Ian Fleming]] in the same year, 1952, that he wrote the first [[James Bond]] novel, ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=British Library | title=The pleasures of Bibliophily: Fifty Years of The book Collector: An Anthology | publication-date=2003 | publisher=British Library ; New Castle, Del. : Oak Knoll Press | isbn=978-1-58456-097-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The journal has had only four editors since it was founded. After the death in 1965 of John Hayward, the friend and muse of [[T.S. Eliot]], it was edited for fifty years by [[Nicolas Barker]], sometime publisher and first head of conservation at the [[British Library]]. In 2015 he stepped down and James Fergusson, founding obituaries editor of ''[[The Independent]]'', 1986-2007, took his place.

Essays about book collecting by Geoffrey Keynes in the Book Collector has been published in a compilation volume. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author1=Keynes, Geoffrey Sir, 1887-1982| title=To Geoffrey Keynes: articles contributed to "The Book Collector" to commemorate his eighty-fifth birthday|publication-date=1972|work=The Book Collector|isbn=978-0-903482-00-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication ==
''The Book Collector'' publishes four times a year in March, June, September and December. Each issue consists of 192pp and is sent to subscribers by airmail, where appropriate. Subscribers also have digital access to every issue of ''The Book Collector'', as printed, since its first appearance in 1952 and to its predecessor ''Book Handbook'', which was published in twenty-eight numbers between 1947 and 1951. There is no restriction for libraries and other institutions on the number of digital users. ''The Book Collector'''s website holds its complete archive, indexed.

'''''The Cats of Copenhagen''''' is a posthumously-published short story written by Irish author [[James Joyce]] and illustrated by American artist [[Casey Sorrow]]. Written in 1936 for his grandson [[Stephen James Joyce]], it was not published until 2012, when Joyce's work entered the [[public domain]] in certain [[Jurisdiction (area)|jurisdictions]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://joycefoundation.osu.edu/joyce-copyright/fair-use-and-permissions/about-law/currently-unpublished "Copyright Status of Currently Unpublished Material"], International James Joyce Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story describes the city of [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, where "things are not as they seem", and is critical of "[[Fat cat (term)|fat cats]]" and other authority figures.

==Publication==
Ithys Press published their fine arts edition of ''The Cats of Copenhagen'' in January 2012.&lt;ref name=ithyspress&gt;[http://ithyspress.wordpress.com/2012/02/10/james-joyces-the-cats-of-copenhagen/ "James Joyce children's story The Cats of Copenhagen gets first publication"], ''Ithys Press''&lt;/ref&gt;  This edition features original pen and ink illustrations by [[Casey Sorrow]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Art Odyssey|journal=ImagineFX|date=May 2012|issue=82|page=22|url=http://www.imaginefx.com/02287754333292241627/imaginefx-82.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ithyspress.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/casey-sorrow-and-his-cats/ "Casey Sorrow and his Cats"], ''Ithys Press''&lt;/ref&gt; letterpress typeset by Michael Caine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ithyspress.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/michael-caine-book-artist/ "Michael Caine, book artist"], ''Ithys Press''&lt;/ref&gt; and handmade paper marbling and binding of Christopher Rowlatt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ithyspress.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/christopher-rowlatt-taking-the-stylus-for-a-walk/ "Christopher Rowlatt – taking the stylus for a walk"], ''Ithys Press''&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication attracted controversy, as the Zürich James Joyce Foundation's Fritz Senn expressed disappointment that the script of ''The Cats of Copenhagen'' had been copied from a letter held at the Foundation without consultation or discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Flood, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/09/james-joyce-childrens-story-cats-copenhagen "James Joyce children's story The Cats of Copenhagen gets first publication"], ''The Guardian'', 9 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Douez, [http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/culture/New_Joyce_book_creates_controversy_in_Zurich.html?cid=32306464 "New Joyce book creates controversy in Zurich"], ''Swiss Broadcasting Corporation'', 17 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Florence Waters, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/9074340/James-Joyces-childrens-story-sparks-publishing-row.html "James Joyce's children's story sparks publishing row"], ''The Telegraph'', 10 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16982445 "James Joyce children's book sparks feud"], ''BBC News'', 10 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deidre Wengen, [http://www.phillyburbs.com/blogs/book_checked/publication-of-a-james-joyce-children-s-story-causes-controversy/article_24aa93e0-5714-11e1-8fd0-001a4bcf6878.html "Publication of a James Joyce children's story causes controversy"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421164558/http://www.phillyburbs.com/blogs/book_checked/publication-of-a-james-joyce-children-s-story-causes-controversy/article_24aa93e0-5714-11e1-8fd0-001a4bcf6878.html |date=21 April 2012 }}, ''PhillyBurbs'', 14 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terence Killeen, [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2012/0208/1224311465140.html "Joyce children's story published in Dublin to dismay in Zürich"], ''Irish Times'', 8 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The History of The Hobbit''''' is a two-volume study of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]’s ''[[The Hobbit]]''. It was published by [[HarperCollins]] in May and June 2007 in the United Kingdom, with both volumes released in the United States by [[Houghton Mifflin]] on 21 September 2007; a boxed set combining ''The Hobbit'' with ''The History of'' The Hobbit was released on 26 October 2007. A single volume edition was released on 27 October 2011.

The two-volume work contains Tolkien’s unpublished drafts of the novel, with commentary by John D. Rateliff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.forodrim.org/arda/tbchron.html | title = A chronological bibliography of the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien | date = 1 September 2002 | origyear = 16 March 1996 | first = Åke | last = Bertenstam }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also details Tolkien’s various revisions to ''The Hobbit'', including abandoned revisions for the unpublished third edition of the work, intended for 1960, as well as previously unpublished original maps and illustrations drawn by Tolkien himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/historyofthehobbit2.htm | title = History of the Hobbit: An essential resource book for the forthcoming movie adaptation of The Hobbit | date = 13 October 2006 | publisher = Tolkien Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
''The History of'' The Hobbit: ''Volume I: Mr. Baggins''. This contains the first half of Tolkien’s draft material for ''The Hobbit'', along with commentary. It was published in the UK on 4 May 2007.

''The History of'' The Hobbit: ''Volume II: Return to Bag-End'', contains the last half of Tolkien’s original manuscript draft, with commentary and later drafts and appendices. It volume was published in the UK on 18 June 2007.

==Relationship to ''The History of Middle-earth''==
When [[Christopher Tolkien]] began publishing ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', a twelve-volume series documenting J. R. R. Tolkien’s creative writing process in the creation of [[Middle-earth]], with texts dating from the 1910s to the 1990s, he made a conscious decision not to issue a volume detailing the creation of ''The Hobbit''. According to him, ''The Hobbit'' was not originally a part of the Middle-earth universe and was attached to his father's earlier, far darker [[legendarium]] only superficially, although the existence of ''The Hobbit'' forever altered the legendarium.

As Christopher Tolkien was not going to embark on a published study of ''The Hobbit'', the task was given to Taum Santoski in the 1980s. Santoski had connections to the [[Marquette University|Marquette]] collection of Tolkien material, which is where the original manuscripts reside. He died in 1991, and ultimately the task passed to John Rateliff. Although Christopher Tolkien did not work directly on ''The History of The Hobbit'', the work is in a very similar vein to the "literary archaeology" of his ''History of Middle-earth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/booksbytolkien/historyofme/description.htm | title = Books by J.R.R.Tolkien - The History of Middle-earth | work = Tolkien Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rateliff submitted a finished draft of the book to Christopher Tolkien, who, approving of the work, gave ''The History of The Hobbit'' his personal blessing to be published in association with his father’s other works.

[[File:The Paston Treasure.jpg|thumb|''The Paston Treasure'' circa 1670 (246 x 165 cm)]]
'''''The Paston Treasure''''' is an historically rare record of a ''[[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinet of treasures]]'' in British collecting. Commissioned by either Sir [[Robert Paston]] or his father [[Sir William Paston, 1st Baronet|Sir William Paston]] in the early 1670s,&lt;ref&gt;https://britishart.yale.edu/exhibitions/paston-treasure-microcosm-known-world&lt;/ref&gt; the oil painting depicts a small fraction of the Paston family's collected treasures. It was executed by an unknown Dutch artist who resided at the Paston family residence at [[Oxnead]] Hall near [[Aylsham]] in [[Norfolk]] for approximately 3 months, in order to complete the commission.

The objects were collected by Robert and his father, Sir William Paston (c.1610–1663) who made acquisitions on a long journey travelling through Europe and on to Cairo and Jerusalem. The collection consisted of over 200 objects and included many natural curiosities made into decorative art objects, such as mounted seashells and ostrich eggs. The painting was unknown for centuries, and before it was donated to the [[Norwich Castle Museum]] in 1947, its last owner warned that it was "very faded, of no artistic value, only curious from an archaeological pint of view."&lt;ref&gt;Alice Spawls (13 September 2018). "[https://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n17/alice-spawls/at-norwich-castle-museum At Norwich Castle Museum]." Retrieved October 20th, 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; It is now on display, with the [[strombus]] shell in an enamelled mount, as part of the Norwich Castle Museum Collection.

The importance of ''The Paston Treasure'' lies in the international scope and interest of the objects portrayed, reflecting both exotic nature and the skills of man. It is the subject of an exhibition in 2018 in which [[Norwich Castle Museum]] in partnership with the [[Yale Center for British Art]] in the USA, reunite, for the first time in 350 years, as many as possible of the objects depicted in the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastangliaartfund.org.uk/exhibitions/the-paston-treasure-microcosm-of-the-known-world |title=The Paston Treasure, Microcosm of the Known World / East Anglia Art Fund |website=Eastangliaartfund.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://events.stanford.edu/events/581/58105/ |title=Spike Bucklow, U. of Cambridge, "John Donne's Melancholic Portrait" |website=Events.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Titicut Follies''''' is a 1967 American [[Direct Cinema]] [[documentary film]] directed by [[Frederick Wiseman]] and filmed by [[John Marshall (filmmaker)|John Marshall]], about the patient-inmates of [[Bridgewater State Hospital]] for the criminally insane, a [[List of Massachusetts state correctional facilities|Massachusetts Correctional Institution]] in [[Bridgewater, Massachusetts]]. In 1967 the film won awards in [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]. Later on, Wiseman made a number of such films examining social institutions (e.g. hospitals, police, schools, etc.) in the United States.

The title of the film is taken from a [[talent show]] put on by the inmates of the hospital, which was named after the [[Massachusett language|Wampanoag]] name for the nearby [[Taunton River]].

==Synopsis==
''Titicut Follies'' portrays the occupants of [[Bridgewater State Hospital]], who are holed up in empty cells and infrequently bathed. It also depicts inmates/patients required to strip naked publicly, [[force feeding]], and indifference and bullying by many of the hospital staff.

==Production==
''Titicut Follies'' was the beginning of the documentary career of Fred Wiseman, a Boston-born lawyer turned filmmaker. He originally took his law classes from Boston University to the institution for educational purposes and had “wanted to do a film there.” He began calling the superintendent of the facility looking for permission to film a year prior to production. Wiseman had previously produced ''[[The Cool World (film)|The Cool World]]'', a 1964 film based on [[Warren Miller (author)|Warren Miller]]’s [[The Cool World (novel)|novel]], an experience that informed his desire to direct. He drafted a proposal that was verbally agreed to by the superintendent, which later came into question when the film began distribution. Following that agreement filming began, with corrections staff following Wiseman at all times and determining on the spot whether the subjects filmed were mentally competent, adding further confusion to an already fraught process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Carolyn Anderson, “The Conundrum of Competing Rights in Titicut Follies,” Journal of the University Film Association, 33, no. 1 (1981): 17, https://www.jstor.org/stable/20687550.&lt;/ref&gt; While on location Wiseman recorded the sound and directed the cameraman with his microphone or hand directions. As his cameraman he hired John Marshall, an established ethnographic filmmaker.&lt;ref name="Google books"&gt;{{cite news|first=Carolyn|last=Anderson|title=Documentary Dilemmas: Frederick Wiseman's Titicut Follies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wLJZ7WCUFr8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Documentary+Dilemmas:+Frederick+Wiseman+Titicut+Follies#v=onepage&amp;q=Documentary%20Dilemmas%3A%20Frederick%20Wiseman%20Titicut%20Follies&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiseman and Marshall spent 29 days documenting the conditions at Bridgewater and shot 80,000 feet of film. Wiseman then spent approximately a year cutting the footage into the final 84-minute narrative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Censorship==
Just before the film was due to be shown at the 1967 [[New York Film Festival]], the government of Massachusetts tried to get an injunction banning its release,&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jesse|last=Pearson|title=The Follies of Documentary Filmmaking|url=https://www.vice.com/read/doc-v14n9|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|accessdate=2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming the film violated the patients' privacy and dignity.&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Mills |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Mass.

Reason 39 (2007): 50-56. 2007. EBSCOhost. American University, Washington, DC. 5 Nov. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiseman appealed to the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]], which in 1969 allowed it to be shown only to doctors, lawyers, judges, health-care professionals, social workers, and students in these and related fields.&lt;ref name="Vice"/&gt; Wiseman appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court]], which refused to hear the case.&lt;ref name="MassCourt"/&gt;

Wiseman believes that the government of Massachusetts, concerned that the film portrayed a state institution in a bad light, intervened to protect its reputation. The state intervened after a social worker in [[Minnesota]] wrote to  Massachusetts Governor [[John Volpe]] expressing shock at a scene involving a naked man being taunted by a guard.&lt;ref name="Vice"/&gt;

The dispute was the first known instance in American history of a film being banned from general distribution for reasons other than obscenity, immorality or national security.&lt;ref&gt;Lesser, Wendy. "Unwise Restrictions", ''The Threepenny Review'' 48 (1992). 1992. JSTOR. American University, Washington, D.C. 5 Nov. 2008 &lt;https://www.jstor.org/pss/4384055&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the first time that Massachusetts recognized a [[right to privacy]] at the state level.&lt;ref name="lettheviewerdecide"/&gt; Wiseman has said, “The obvious point that I was making was that the restriction of the court was a greater infringement of civil liberties than the film was an infringement on the liberties of the inmates.”&lt;ref name="lettheviewerdecide"/&gt;

Little changed until 1987, when the families of seven inmates who died at the hospital sued the hospital and state. Steven Schwartz represented one of the inmates. Schwartz's client was "restrained for 2½ months and given six psychiatric drugs at vastly unsafe levels—choked to death because he could not swallow his food."&lt;ref name="shiningalight"&gt;Horn, Miriam.

''Documentary Film: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford UP, Incorporated, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Superior Court Judge Andrew Meyer allowed the film to be released to the general public, saying that as time had passed, privacy concerns had become less important than [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] concerns. He also said that many of the former patients had died, so there was little risk of a violation of their dignity.&lt;ref name="WaPo"/&gt; The state Supreme Court ordered that "A brief explanation shall be included in the film that changes and improvements have taken place at Massachusetts Correctional Institution Bridgewater since 1966."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people =Fredrick Wiseman (director)| title =Titicut Follies| medium =| publisher =Zipporah Films, Inc.| location =| date = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was shown on [[PBS]] on September 4, 1992, its first and only US television airing. Before the film a narrative warning and an introduction by [[Charlie Rose]] were played. At the end the message stating improvements had been made was shown.

The film is now legally available through the distributor, Zipporah Films, Inc., for purchase or rental on DVD and for educational and individual license.  Zipporah Films released the DVD to the home market in December 2007.

The '''Tomb of the Unknown Soldier''' ({{lang-ar|ضريح الجندي المجهول}}) is a [[war memorial]], dedicated to the [[Syrian]] soldiers killed during battle. It is visited every year by the [[President of Syria]] on [[Martyrs' Day (Syria)|Martyrs' Day]] (May 6).

The monument was designed by Prof. Dr. (Architecture) Abdo Kass-Hout and Prof. [[:ar:محمود حماد|Mahmoud Hammad]] who won a competition organized by the Syrian [[Ministry of Defense (Syria)|Ministry of Defense]]. Erected in 1985, the monument features a [[dome]], symbolizing the [[universe]], and an [[arch]], symbolizing victory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=1245 Martyrs' Monument&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620021906/http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=1245 |date=2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a hall under the [[dome]], featuring five large paintings depicting battles from Arab and Syrian history: [[Battle of Yarmouk]] (636), [[Battle of Hattin]] (1187), [[Battle of Maysaloun]] (1920), [[First Battle of Mount Hermon|Battle of Mount Hermon]] (1973) and [[Battle of Sultan Yacoub]] (1982).&lt;ref name=mahmoud&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.mahmoudhammad.com/graphics-2/|title=Monuments – Mahmoud Hammad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two verses from the [[Quran]] are engraved into the structure:&lt;ref name=mahmoud/&gt;
{{quote|Think not of those who are slain in [[Allah|God]]'s Way as dead. Nay, they live, finding their sustenance in the Presence of their Lord; They rejoice in the Bounty provided by God: and with regard to those left behind, who have not yet joined them (in their bliss), the (Martyrs) glory in the fact that on them is no fear, nor have they (cause to) grieve.}}

'''Top-left lighting''' is an artistic convention in which illustrations are produced so that the light appears to come from the top left of the picture.

Most people prefer lighting from the left when resolving a convex-concave ambiguity, and this preference may be stronger for [[right-handedness|right-handed]] people.  This is reflected in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[mosaic]]s and in [[Renaissance painting|Renaissance]], [[baroque painting|baroque]] and [[Impressionism|impressionist]] art.&lt;ref&gt;J. Sun and P. Perona, "Where is the sun?", ''Nature Neuroscience'', 1(3), 183-184, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McManus|first=I Christopher|author2=Joseph Buckman |author3=Euan Woolley |title=Is light in pictures presumed to come from the left side?|journal=Perception|date=2004|volume=33|page=1422|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ian_Mcmanus/publication/8003531_Is_light_in_pictures_presumed_to_come_from_the_left_side/file/79e4151052666c381c.pdf|accessdate=4 March 2014|doi=10.1068/p5289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cartography, the predominant custom of placing the shadow on the right-hand side of [[cartographic relief depiction#Hill profiles|hill profiles]] was established during the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;E. Imhof, ''Cartographic Relief Presentation'', Walter de Gruyter, 1982, reissued by ESRI Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-58948-026-1}}, pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Computer interfaces tend to use top left lighting as well, although this trend has gradually shifted more towards light coming straight from the top.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

There are notable exceptions to this convention, such as Sandro Botticelli's [[The_Birth_of_Venus_(Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]] due to the point of view which may represent geographical perspective and location.

[[File:Hz Programm.jpg|thumb|Automated even type color in a demonstration from the early 1990s. The technology was later purchased by Adobe and added to their [[InDesign]] product.]]
'''Type color''' is an element of [[typography]] that describes how dense or heavy the text appears on the page.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Elements of Typographic Style|last = Bringhurst|first = Robert|publisher = Hartley &amp; Marks|year = 2004|isbn = 0881792055|location = Vancouver, BC|pages = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding the correct balance of type color and [[white space (visual arts)|white space]] can make text more easily readable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Robin|title=Beyond The Mac is not a typewriter : more typographic insights and secrets|date=1996|publisher=Peachpit Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=0201885980|page=155|chapter=Typographic color}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term type color should not be confused with the usual meaning of color, (i.e. red, yellow, blue), instead it has more to do with the blackness or boldness of the text on the page. A bold font creates more contrast on the page, therefore creates more emphasis.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://practicaltypography.com/color.html|title = Butterick's Practical Typography - Color|date = 2014|accessdate = November 1, 2014|website = Butterick's Practical Typography|publisher = |last = Butterick|first = Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a bold font is therefore one way that type color can be adjusted.

There are four different decisions a typographer can make that affect the type color. These are the letter spacing, the way the specific font or type is designed, word spacing, and line spacing (leading).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Text will appear darker or blacker if the letters are kerned more closely, or if there is less spacing between the lines of text. Other elements that affect type color can be harder to grasp, such as the rhythm of the type, the contrast, and even the texture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Type color should be fairly consistent throughout a piece of text, with possible slight changes for emphasis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Type color of text is affected by the amount and weight of the strokes on a page. Similar to when writing with a pen on paper, the more layers of strokes, the darker the text. At smaller sizes, darker colored text does not necessarily mean that text will be more legible. The boldness and weight at this smaller size can actually make a piece of text more difficult to read. For this reason, the fonts that are commonly used to type large blocks of text are not overly dark or heavy on the page. They create a good balance of text color and white space. This balance is important for an attractive and legible piece of text. There are differences between acceptable and legible levels of type color between body text and headings or titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sgrais/typographic_color.htm|title = Typographic Color|date = |accessdate = November 1, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = Grais|first = Stuart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Type color also extends to refer to the overall blackness of a page of text. A paragraph or page of text that is more dense or bolder will have an overall blacker effect when viewed as a whole. Likewise, a finer font or less dense text will have more white space, making the overall effect less dark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://fontslate.info/terminology/index.html#c|title = Font Slate - Typographic terminology|date = 2012|accessdate = November 1, 2014|website = Font Slate|publisher = Wolson Design|last = Wolson|first = Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Electronic Superhighway by Nam June Paik.jpg|thumb|[[Nam June Paik]]'s Electronic Superhighway: [[Continental United States]], Alaska, Hawaii 1995]]

'''Video art''' is an art form which relies on using [[video]] technology as a visual and audio medium. Video art emerged during the late 1960s as new consumer video technology such as [[video tape recorders]] became available outside corporate broadcasting. Video art can take many forms: recordings that are [[broadcast]]; [[installation art|installations]] viewed in galleries or museums; works streamed online, distributed as [[video tape]]s, or [[DVD]]s; and [[performances]] which may incorporate one or more [[television set]]s, [[video monitor]]s, and projections, displaying live or recorded images and sounds.&lt;ref&gt;Hartney, Mick. [http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10215 "Video art"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017023139/http://moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10215 |date=2011-10-17 }}, [[MoMA]], accessed January 31, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Video art is named for the original analog [[video tape]], which was the most commonly used recording technology in much of the form history into the 1990s. With the advent of digital recording equipment, many artists began to explore digital technology as a new way of expression.

One of the key differences between video art and theatrical cinema is that video art does not necessarily rely on many of the conventions that define theatrical cinema. Video art may not employ the use of [[actor]]s, may contain no [[dialogue]], may have no discernible [[narrative]] or [[plot (narrative)|plot]], or adhere to any of the other conventions that generally define [[motion picture]]s as entertainment. This distinction also distinguishes video art from cinema's subcategories such as [[avant garde]] cinema, [[short films]], or [[experimental film]].

Video art is often said to have begun when Paik used his new [[Sony]] [[Portapak]] to shoot footage of [[Pope Paul VI]]'s procession through [[New York City]] in the autumn of 1965&lt;ref&gt;Laura Cumming (December 19, 2010), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/19/nam-june-paik-tate-liverpool-review Nam June Paik – review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126202759/https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/dec/19/nam-june-paik-tate-liverpool-review |date=2016-11-26 }} Nam June Paik ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same day, across town in a [[Greenwich Village]] cafe, Paik played the tapes and video art was born.

Prior to the introduction of consumer video equipment, moving image production was only available non-commercially via [[8mm film]] and [[16mm film]]. After the Portapak's introduction and its subsequent update every few years, many artists began exploring the new technology.

Many of the early prominent video artists were those involved with concurrent movements in conceptual art, performance, and experimental film. These include Americans [[Vito Acconci]], [[Valie Export]], [[John Baldessari]], [[Peter Campus]], [[Doris Totten Chase]], [[Maureen Connor]], [[Norman Cowie]], [[Dimitri Devyatkin]], [[Frank Gillette]], [[Dan Graham]], [[Gary Hill]], [[Joan Jonas]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Bill Viola]], [[Shigeko Kubota]], [[Martha Rosler]], [[William Wegman (photographer)|William Wegman]], and many others. There were also those such as [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]] who were interested in the formal qualities of video and employed video synthesizers to create abstract works.

==In the 1970s==
Much video art in the medium's heyday experimented formally with the limitations of the video format. For example, American artist [[Peter Campus]]' ''Double Vision'' combined the video signals from two Sony [[Portapak]]s through an electronic mixer, resulting in a distorted and radically dissonant image. Another representative piece, [[Joan Jonas]]' ''[[Vertical Roll]]'', involved recording previously-recorded material of Jonas dancing while playing the videos back on a television, resulting in a layered and complex representation of mediation.

[[File:Joan Jonas Vertical Roll.jpg|thumb|left| A still from Jonas' 1972 video]]
Much video art in America was produced out of New York City, with [[The Kitchen]], founded in 1972 by [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]] (and assisted by video director [[Dimitri Devyatkin]] and Shridhar Bapat), serving as a nexus for many young artists. An early multi-channel video art work (using several monitors or screens) was ''[[Frank Gillette#Wipe Cycle.2C 1969|Wipe Cycle]]'' by [[Ira Schneider]] and [[Frank Gillette]]. ''Wipe Cycle'' was first exhibited at the Howard Wise Gallery in New York in 1969 as part of an exhibition titled "TV as a Creative Medium". An installation of nine television screens, ''Wipe Cycle'' combined live images of gallery visitors, found footage from commercial television, and shots from pre-recorded tapes. The material was alternated from one monitor to the next in an elaborate choreography.
[[File:Heuschrecken.jpg|thumb|Wolf Vostell, ''[[Grasshopper]]s'' (''Heuschrecken''), 1970 ([[installation art|Installation]] with video monitors and video camera)]]

On the West coast, the San Jose State television studios in 1970, [[Willoughby Sharp]] began the "Videoviews" series of videotaped dialogues with artists. The "Videoviews" series consists of Sharps’ dialogues with [[Bruce Nauman]] (1970), [[Joseph Beuys]] (1972), [[Vito Acconci]] (1973), [[Chris Burden]] (1973), [[Lowell Darling]] (1974), and [[Dennis Oppenheim]] (1974). Also in 1970, Sharp curated "Body Works", an exhibition of video works by [[Vito Acconci]], [[Terry Fox (artist)|Terry Fox]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Keith Sonnier]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]] and [[William Wegman (photographer)|William Wegman]] which was presented at Tom Marioni's [[Museum of Conceptual Art]], San Francisco, California.

In Europe, [[Valie Export]]'s groundbreaking video piece, "Facing a Family" (1971) was one of the first instances of television intervention and broadcasting video art. The video, originally broadcast on the Austrian television program "Kontakte" February 2, 1971,[11] shows a bourgeois Austrian family watching TV while eating dinner, creating a mirroring effect for many members of the audience who were doing the same thing. Export believed the television could complicate the relationship between subject, spectator, and television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eai.org/title.htm?id=6472|title=Electronic Arts Intermix: Facing a Family, Valie Export|work=eai.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225155438/http://eai.org/title.htm?id=6472|archivedate=2010-12-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom [[David Hall (video artist)|David Hall]]'s "TV Interruptions" (1971) were transmitted intentionally unannounced and uncredited on Scottish TV, the first artist interventions on British television.

==1980s-1990s==

As the prices of editing software decreased, the access the general public had to utilize these technologies increased. Video editing software became so readily available that it changed the way digital media artists and video artists interacted with the mediums. Different themes emerged and were explored in the artists work, such as interactivity and nonlinearity. Criticisms of the editing software focused on the freedom that was created for the artists through the technology, but not for the audience. Some artists combined physical and digital techniques to allow their audience to physically explore the digital work. An example of this is Jeffrey Shaw's "Legible City" (1988–91). In this piece the "audience" rides a stationary bicycle through a virtual images of Manhattan, Amsterdam, and Karlsrule. The images change depending on the direction of the bike handles, and the speed of the pedaler. This created a unique virtual experience for every participant.

== 2000s-Today ==
As technology and editing techniques have evolved since the emergence of video as an art form, artists have been able to experiment more with video art without using any of their own content. [[Marco Brambilla]]'s [https://vimeo.com/5082155 "Civilization" (2008)] shows this technique. Brambilla attempts to make a video version of a collage, or a "video mural" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://motionographer.com/2009/03/15/marco-brambilla-civilization/|title=Marco Brambilla: Civilization|date=2009-03-16|work=Motionographer|access-date=2018-03-03|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331104357/http://motionographer.com/2009/03/15/marco-brambilla-civilization/|archivedate=2018-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by combining various clips from movies, and editing them to portray heaven and hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.seditionart.com/marco-brambilla/civilization-hell-and-heaven|title=Civilization (Hell and Heaven) by Marco Brambilla|website=www.seditionart.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331040630/https://www.seditionart.com/marco-brambilla/civilization-hell-and-heaven|archivedate=2018-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are artists today who have changed the way video art is perceived and viewed.  In 2003, [[Kalup Linzy]] created Conversations Wit De Churen II:  All My Churen, a soap opera satire that has been credited as creating the video and performance sub-genre [http://www.vulture.com/2016/04/identity-politics-that-forever-changed-art.html 'Theatre of the Self, Performing who you are'.]  Although Linzy's work is genre defying his work has been a major contribution to the medium.   [[Ryan Trecartin]], and experimental young video-artist, uses color, editing techniques and bizarre acting to portray what the New Yorker calls "a cultural watershed".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/03/24/experimental-people|title=Experimental People|last=Tomkins|first=Calvin|date=2014-03-17|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en|issn=0028-792X|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331104254/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/03/24/experimental-people|archivedate=2018-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/what-you-need-to-know-about-lizzie-fitch-and-ryan-trecartin|title=What You Need to Know About Lizzie Fitch and Ryan Trecartin, the Artists Behind Kendall and Gigi's W Cover Story|last=Solway|first=Diane|work=W Magazine|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331040309/https://www.wmagazine.com/story/what-you-need-to-know-about-lizzie-fitch-and-ryan-trecartin|archivedate=2018-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trecartin played with the portrayal of identity and ended up producicng characters who "can be many people at the same time".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When asked about his characters, Trecartin explained that he visualized that each person's identity was made up of "areas" and that they could all be very different from each other and be expressed at different times.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ryan Trecartin is an innovative artist who has been said to have "changed the way we engage with the world and with one another"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; through video art. A series of videos made by Trecartin titled I-BE-AREA displayed this, one example is [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR4sHDR-1XE I-BE-AREA (Pasta and Wendy M-PEGgy)], which was made public in 2008, which portrays a character named Wendy who behaves erratically. When asked about his characters, Trecartin explained that he visualized that each person's identity was made up of "areas" and that they could all be very different from each other and be expressed at different times.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ryan Trecartin is an innovative artist who has been said to have "changed the way we engage with the world and with one another"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; through video art.  In 2008, New York Times Holland Cotter writes, 'A big difference between his work and Mr. Trecartin’s is in the degree of digital engagement. Mr. Trecartin goes wild with editing bells and whistles; Mr. Linzy does not. The plainness and occasional clunkiness of his video technique is one reason the Braswell serial ends up touching in a way that Mr. Trecartin’s buzzed-up narratives rarely are. For all their raunchy hilarity Mr. Linzy’s characters are more than cartoons; “All My Churen” is a family-values story that has a lot to do with life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/arts/design/06cott.html|title=Video Art Thinks Big: That’s Showbiz|last=Cotter|first=Holland|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance art and Video art ==
Video art as a medium can also be combined with other forms of artistic expression such as [[Performance art]]. This combination can also be refereed to as "media and performance art" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/media-and-performance-art/performing-for-the-camera|title=MoMA {{!}} Performing for the Camera|website=www.moma.org|access-date=2018-03-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331040235/https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/media-and-performance-art/performing-for-the-camera|archivedate=2018-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; when artists "break the mold of video and film and broaden the boundaries of art".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With increased ability for artists to obtain video cameras, performance art started being documented and shared across large amounts of audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/conceptual-art/performance-into-art|title=MoMA {{!}} Performance into Art|website=www.moma.org|access-date=2018-03-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215225208/https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/conceptual-art/performance-into-art|archivedate=2017-12-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists such as [[Marina Abramović|Marina Abramovic]] and [[Ulay]] experimented with video taping their performances in the 1970s and the 1980s. In a piece titled “Rest energy” (1980) both Ulay and Marina suspended their weight so that they pulled back a bow and arrow aimed at her heart, Ulay held the arrow, and Marina the bow. The piece was 4:10 which Marina described as being “a performance about complete and total trust”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/multimedia/audio/190/1976|title=Museum of Modern Art {{!}} MoMA|website=www.moma.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331040251/https://www.moma.org/multimedia/audio/190/1976|archivedate=2018-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artists who combined Video art with Performance art used the camera as the audience. [[Kate Gilmore (artist)|Kate Gilmore]] experimented with the positioning of the camera. In her video [https://vimeo.com/99040802 “Anything” (2006)] she films her performance piece as she is constantly trying the reach the camera which is staring down at her. As the 13-minute video goes on, she continues to tie together pieces of furniture while constantly attempting to reach the camera. Gilmore added an element of struggle to her art which is sometimes self-imposed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://landmarks.utexas.edu/video-art/kate-gilmore-0|title=Kate Gilmore {{!}} LANDMARKS|website=landmarks.utexas.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823201836/https://landmarks.utexas.edu/video-art/kate-gilmore-0|archivedate=2016-08-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in her video [https://vimeo.com/99149001 “My love is an anchor” (2004)] she lets her foot dry in cement before attempting to break free on camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bates.edu/news/2009/07/01/break-on-through/|title=Break on Through|date=2009-07-01|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320230607/http://www.bates.edu/news/2009/07/01/break-on-through/|archivedate=2018-03-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilmore has said to have mimicked expression styles from the 1960s and 1970s with inspirations like Marina Abramovic as she adds extremism and struggle to her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mocacleveland.org/exhibitions/kate-gilmore-body-work|title=Kate Gilmore: Body of Work {{!}} MOCA Cleveland|website=mocacleveland.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320230648/http://mocacleveland.org/exhibitions/kate-gilmore-body-work|archivedate=2018-03-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some artists experimented with space when combining Video art and Performance art. [[Ragnar Kjartansson (performance artist)|Ragnar Kjartannson]], an Icelandic artist, filmed an entire music video with 9 different artists, including himself, being filmed in different rooms. All the artists could hear each other through a pair of headphones so that they could play the song together, the piece was titled "The visitors" (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/10/28/498718095/art-star-ragnar-kjartansson-moves-people-to-tears-over-and-over|title=Art Star Ragnar Kjartansson Moves People To Tears, Over And Over|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-03-02|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331040740/https://www.npr.org/2016/10/28/498718095/art-star-ragnar-kjartansson-moves-people-to-tears-over-and-over|archivedate=2018-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the nation’s oldest and largest theater company dedicated to developing, producing and promoting the work of female-identified theater artists at every stage in their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/13-3369451|title=The Women's Project &amp; Productions, Inc.|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829033607/https://www.guidestar.org/profile/13-3369451|archive-date=2017-08-29|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Lisa McNulty serves as the Producing Artistic Director and Michael Sag serves as the Managing Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/MTCs-Lisa-McNulty-Named-New-Producing-Artistic-Director-of-Womens-Project-Theater-20140723|title=MTC's Lisa McNulty Named New Producing Artistic Director of Women's Project Theater|last=Desk|first=BWW News|work=BroadwayWorld.com|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/michael-sag-joins-wp-theater-as-managing-director|title=Michael Sag Joins WP Theater as Managing Director|work=[[Playbill]]|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
WP Theater was founded in 1978 by Julia Miles to address the conspicuous underrepresentation of women artists working in the American theater. Miles was producing at [[The American Place Theatre]], an Off-Broadway theater dedicated to producing new work by American writers. Miles began as Assistant Manager at The American Place Theatre in 1964 and advanced in the ranks to Associate Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.backstage.com/news/julia-miles-wpps-founder-reviews-career/|title=Julia Miles: WPP's Founder Reviews Career|work=Backstage.com|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, she noted the lack of plays written by women being produced by The American Place Theatre in comparison to those written by men. Under a grant from the [[Ford Foundation]], Miles created The Women’s Project under the umbrella of The American Place Theatre to encourage the development of female playwrights and directors and to provide a forum for their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/03/archives/choices-opens-womens-program.html|title=‘Choices’ Opens Women's Program|last=Times|first=Special To The New York|date=1978-12-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; For its first nine years, WP Theater staged its productions in the basement of The American Place theatre. In 1987, the project left The American Place Theatre and became an independent organization, known today as WP Theater. In 1998, the project bought a church at 424 West [[55th Street (Manhattan)|55th Street]], also the site of Theater Four,&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelminn.net/newyork/theatres/midtown/julia-miles-theatre/index.html Julia Miles Theater / Theatre Four], michaelminn.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{iobdb venue|156|Theater Four}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was named the [[Julia Miles Theater]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nyc-arts.org/organizations/21689/julia-miles-theater Julia Miles Theater], nyc-arts.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{iobdb venue|67|Julia Miles Theater}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WP Theater aims to empower artists who have historically been marginalized for their gender or gender expression to reach their full potential. The fundamental components of WP Theater are the Mainstage Season, the WP Lab and Pipeline Festival, and the annual Women of Achievement Awards gala.

WP Theater artist alumni include [[Billie Allen]], [[Anne Bogart]], [[Pearl Cleage]], [[Eve Ensler]], [[María Irene Fornés]], [[Pam MacKinnon]], [[Dominique Morisseau]], [[Lynn Nottage]], [[Joyce Carol Oates]], [[Diane Paulus]], [[Sarah Ruhl]], [[Anna Deavere Smith]], and [[Rebecca Taichman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Women's Project Theater Production History|url=http://www.tcg.org/publications/at/Feb08/women.cfm|newspaper=American Theatre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actors who have performed in WP Theater productions include [[Tony Award]] winners and nominees [[Michael Cerveris]], [[Kathleen Chalfant]], [[Colleen Dewhurst]], [[Tammy Grimes]], [[Cherry Jones]], [[Tonya Pinkins]], [[Daphne Rubin-Vega]], [[Thomas Sadoski]], and [[Frances Sternhagen]], [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winners and nominees [[Linda Hunt]], [[Kim Hunter]], and [[Mary McDonnell]], and [[Emmy Award]] winners and nominees [[Ruby Dee]], [[America Ferrera]], [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], [[Jimmy Smits]], and [[John Spencer (actor)|John Spencer]].

Alumni of the WP Lab include [[JoAnne Akalaitis]], [[Tea Alagic|Tea Alagić]], [[Rachel Chavkin]], [[Quiara Alegría Hudes|Quíara Alegria Hudes]], and [[Anne Kauffman]]. Many Lab alumni have served as Artistic Directors at other theater companies, including Akalaitis ([[Shakespeare in the Park (New York City)|New York Shakespeare Festival]] and the [[The Public Theater|Public Theater]]), [[Emily Mann (director)|Emily Mann]] ([[McCarter Theatre]]), and [[Carey Perloff]] ([[American Conservatory Theater|A.C.T.]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-15/entertainment/ca-618_1_public-theater/2|title='I'm Not Avant-Garde' : JoAnne Akalaitis, Joseph Papp's heir, faces the biggest challenge of her career: getting the public into New York's Public Theater|last=Pacheco|first=Patrick|date=1992-11-15|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-08-30|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://princetonol.com/patron/emann/|title=Emily Mann, Artistic Director of McCarter Theatre|website=princetonol.com|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theatrebayarea.org/?page=Bios|title=Benefit Bios &amp; Headshots|website=www.theatrebayarea.org|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Productions ==
Since 1978, WP Theater has produced more than 600 Off-Broadway plays and developmental projects and has partnered with a number of other New York theater companies for co-productions, including [[Playwrights Horizons]] and [[The New Group]]. Often, WP Theater produces plays that are New York premieres or world premieres. These include ''Bright Half Life'' written by [[Tanya Barfield]] and directed by [[Leigh Silverman]], ''Stuffed'' by [[Lisa Lampanelli]], ''Or,'' by [[Liz Duffy Adams]], and [[Virginia Woolf]]'s only play, ''Freshwater'', directed by Anne Bogart.

WP Theater's first production was ''Choices'', a one-woman show that was adapted from the works of [[Colette]], Virginia Woolf, [[Dorothy Parker]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Sylvia Plath]], [[Adrienne Rich]], and [[Joan Didion]], amongst others. It was conceived by writer [[Patricia Bosworth]] and adapted by Bosworth, director Caymichael Patten, and actress [[Lily Lodge]]. ''Choices'' ran from November 30 to December 17, 1978, in the American Place Theatre basement. Julia Miles said the production "explores the choices that women have. Hopefully, there are now more of those choices and women are more definite about what they are." After the production opened, [[Mel Gussow]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "''Choices'' serves as a brief introduction to the artistic energy of literary women. Given the variety of versatile people who are engaged in the 'Women's Project', we look forward to the plays, playwrights and directors that should emerge from the American Place."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/11/archives/stage-choices-womens-anthology-artistic-energy.html|title=Stage: ''Choices'', Women's Anthology|last=Gussow|first=Mel|date=1978-12-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-31|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, WP Theater produced ''Still Life'', a documentary-style play about the aftermath of the Vietnam War written and directed by Emily Mann. The production featured Mary McDonnell, Timothy Near, and John Spencer and earned four [[Obie Award|Obie Awards]], including the award for Best Production.

One of WP Theater’s most heralded productions is [[A... My Name Is Alice|''A...My Name is Alice'']], a [[revue]] of songs and sketches conceived and directed by [[Julianne Boyd]] and [[Joan Micklin Silver]]. The production earned the [[Outer Critics Circle Award]] for Best Revue in the 1983/84 season, and featured songs and scenes penned by [[Winnie Holzman]], [[Marta Kauffman]], [[Anne Meara]], and others.

WP Theater has worked closely with Cuban-American playwright, [[María Irene Fornés]], since its inception. Fornés, a [[Pulitzer Prize]] nominee and nine-time Obie Award winner, is known for her avant-garde and experimental plays. WP Theater has produced three Fornés plays, including ''Abingdon Square'', which earned the 1988 Obie for Best New American Play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bombmagazine.org/article/542/|title=María Irene Fornés by Allen Frame|website=bombmagazine.org|access-date=2017-08-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901025357/http://bombmagazine.org/article/542/|archive-date=2017-09-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Lab ==
The Lab is a two-year residency for female-identified playwrights, directors and producers. Members of the Lab are selected through a highly competitive application and interview process. The Lab provides its members with a vital professional network, entrepreneurial and leadership training, rehearsal space, and opportunities for the development and production of bold new work for the stage.

The Lab began as the Directors Forum, created in 1983. In 1992, WP added the Playwrights Lab. The Producers Lab was added in 2006 to enhance the collaborative nature of the residency.

The Lab has two main goals: to cultivate the work of the participating artists and to give them the tools they need to succeed in the industry. In addition to developing their own unique work, Lab artists collaboratively create a culminating residency production. Since 2016, Lab members’ work has been showcased at the biennial Pipeline Festival. For the month-long Pipeline Festival, groups of three—one writer, one director, and one producer—come together to collaborate on a piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/womens-project-showcases-new-works-at-pipeline|title=Women’s Project Showcases New Works at Pipeline {{!}} Playbill|website=Playbill|language=en|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2016, Lab members would devise new work, showcased in a production at the end of the residency term. These productions include ''The Architecture of Becoming'' (2014), ''We Play for the Gods'' (2012), ''Global Cooling: The Women Chill'' (2009), ''Corporate Carnival'' (2008), and ''Girls Just Wanna Have Fund$'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/aliens-with-extraordinary-skills-freshwater-and-global-chill-set-for-womens-project-season-com-151882|title=Aliens with Extraordinary Skills, Freshwater and Global Chill Set for Women's Project Season {{!}} Playbill|website=Playbill|language=en|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/we-play-for-the-gods-with-annie-golden-and-erika-rolfsud-debuts-off-broadway-com-194169|title=We Play for the Gods, With Annie Golden and Erika Rolfsud, Debuts Off-Broadway {{!}} Playbill|website=Playbill|language=en|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/08/arts/08wfc.html|title=At the World Financial Center, a Circus Breaks Out|last=Mcgee|first=Celia|date=2008-05-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2004, the Lab did not function on a two-year rotation.

Under the auspices of WP Theater, the 2008/2010 Lab Playwrights published ''Out of Time and Place'', a two-volume anthology of plays, including contributions from 11 Lab playwrights and an introduction by [[Theresa Rebeck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vWcoAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=out+of+time+and+place+theresa+rebeck#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Out of Time &amp; Place: An Anthology of Plays by the Women's Project Playwrights Lab|last=Clements|first=Alexis|last2=Evans|first2=Christine|date=2010|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9780578060163|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Lab artists continue to work together long after their official residency ends, and WP Theater continues to advocate for its Lab alumnae by brokering agents, providing references, and submitting their work to theaters around the country. WP Theater also hires many Lab artists for main stage productions.

'''Waruga''' are a type of [[sarcophagus]] or above ground [[tomb]] traditionally used by the [[Minahasa]]ns of [[North Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]]. They are made of stone and consist or a ridged upper part and a box shaped lower section.

Dead Minahasans were originally wrapped in woka, a type of leaf. Woka is the leaf of the fan palm, Livistona. Then they were put in wooden coffins.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In the 9th century the Minahasa started using waruga.

Bodies are put in a position facing north. They seated with heel and toe attaches to the buttocks and the head "kissing" the knees. The Minhasa believe their ancestors came from the north.

In 1828 the Dutch banned the use of waruga&lt;ref name=indo&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WKoIooGXjPYC&amp;pg=PA962&amp;lpg=PA962&amp;dq=Waruga+sarcophagus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uvEGJrG_rg&amp;sig=WFinmy8qUpeos4oRln9NyeUQte0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCmoVChMIuffQyI2fxwIVzCUeCh2rQA2z#v=onepage&amp;q=Waruga%20sarcophagus&amp;f=false Indonesia] by Stephen Backshall page 962&lt;/ref&gt; and the Minahasa started making coffins. Disease outbreak, including typhoid and cholera, was feared. And Christian practice is to bury the dead.

Waruga in Tonsea have carvings and reliefs showing how the bodies are stored in their respective waruga and illustrating livelihoods.

There are about 370 Warugas (waruga-waruga) in [[Rap-Rap]] (15), [[Airmadidi Down]] (211) and  [[Sawangan, North Sulawesi]] (144). They are a tourist attraction and were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1995 in the [[waruga archaeological park]] in Sawangan. At Taman Purbakala Waruga-Waruga, the sarcophagi have been collected from surrounding areas and at a nearby museum porcelain, armbands, axes and bone fragments are exhibited.&lt;ref name=indo/&gt; Most of the waruga have been looted for valuable contents.

== Biography ==
'''Yuri Mikhailovich Neprintsev''' was born August 15, 1909, in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Russian Empire]]. He came from the nobility. His father, Neprintsev Mikhail Nikolaevich was an architect, a Honored Art Worker of Science and Technology of the [[Georgian SSR]] (1946).

In 1926, Neprintsev went to [[Leningrad]] to continue his education. In the years 1926-1930, he studied of Prof. Vasily Savinsky private art studio. In 1929, Neprintsev began to work as designer and graphic artist in the palace-museums of Leningrad and the Pushkin town. In the years 1932–1934, he worked as illustrator for magazines and publishing houses of Leningrad.

[[File:Neprintsev-Yuri-The-Rest-after-battle-bw.jpg|thumb|left|400px|The rest after battle. 1955]] 

In 1934, Neprintsev entered at the third course of painting department of the [[Repin Institute of Arts|Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]]. He studied of Pavel Naumov, Alexander Lubimov, and [[Isaak Brodsky]], who 30 years ago was also a student of Vasily Savinsky.

Together with Neprintsev, in [[Isaak Brodsky]] workshop, studied such famous Russian artists as [[Nikolai Timkov]], [[Piotr Belousov]], [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Laktionov|Alexander Laktionov]], [[Piotr Vasiliev]], [[Mikhail Kozell]], and others.

In 1938, Neprintsev graduated from [[Repin Institute of Arts|Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]] in the workshop of [[Isaak Brodsky]]. His graduation work was a painting named "Alexander Pushkin in Mikhailovskoe village", devoted to the memory of the great Russian poet Alexander Pushkin (1799–1837).&lt;ref&gt;''Anniversary Directory graduates of Saint Petersburg State Academic Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture named after Ilya Repin, Russian Academy of Arts. 1915 - 2005''. - Saint Petersburg: Pervotsvet Publishing House, 2007. p.48.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 Neprintsev was admitted to the [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists|Leningrad Union of Artists]].&lt;ref&gt;''Directory of members of the Leningrad branch of Union of Artists of Russian Federation.'' - Leningrad: Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1987. - p.&amp;nbsp;91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1928, Neprintsev participated in Art Exhibitions. He painted portraits, genre and historical compositions, and landscapes. Yuri Neprintsev worked in oil painting, pencil drawings, watercolors and book illustration. Solo exhibitions by Neprintsev were in 1959 (Moscow, [[Leningrad]], [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]], [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky]], and [[Saratov]]), and in 1989 (Leningrad).

After graduation, Neprintsev continued his education in postgraduate institute under leadership of Prof. [[Rudolf Frentz]] and Prof. [[Boris Ioganson]]. At the same time he taught at the Department of the Drawing.

In 1941, Neprintsev voluntarily joined the [[Red Army]]. He fought in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Second World War]], serving in the [[Baltic Fleet]]. In 1944, Neprintsev was awarded the [[Order of the Red Star]]. He had demobilized in 1946.

In the postwar years, Neprintsev created a series of paintings devoted to the heroic struggle of the Soviet people against Nazi Germany: "The last grenade" (1948), "Lisa Chaikina" (1949), "Rest after the battle. Vasily Terkin" (1951, [[Stalin Prize]] of the first degree (1952), "The story of the father" (1955).

The outstanding work of art by Yuri Neprintsev was painting "Rest after the battle. Vasily Terkin". It by means of painting skillfully expressed the idea of the spiritual unity of the people in wartime. The painting entered the golden fund of Soviet art, as one of the best embodiment of the image of Soviet man.

The original version of painting "Rest after the battle. Vasily Terkin" (1951) was given for Mao Zedong. In 1953 the second version was painted by Neprintsev for the Kremlin. In 1955 he painted the third version for the [[Tretyakov Gallery]].

Over the 50 years, Neprintsev combined his creative activities with pedagogical work. He taught in the [[Repin Institute of Arts|Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture named after Ilya Repin]] since 1938. He was professor of painting (1954–1996), a head of personal workshop and graphical department of [[Repin Institute of Arts]].

In 1953, Neprintsev was elected Corresponding Member of Academy of Arts of the USSR, and in 1970 he was elected member of the Academy of Arts of the USSR.

In 1956 he was awarded the honorary title of Honored Art Worker of Russian Federation, and in 1963 he was awarded the honorary title of [[People's Artist of USSR]].

In 1969 Neprintsev was awarded the [[Order of Red Banner of Labour]], and in 1979 &amp;ndash; the [[Order of Lenin]].

Yuri Neprintsev was a member of the [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists]] (before 1992 &amp;ndash; the [[Leningrad branch of Union of Artists of Russian Federation]]) since 1938.

Yuri Mikhailovich Neprintsev died on October 20, 1996 in Saint Petersburg. Paintings by Yuri Neprintsev are in [[State Russian Museum]], [[Tretyakov Gallery|State Treryakov Gallery]], in the numerous Art museums and private collections in Russia, France, England, USA, China, Ukraine, Italy, Japan, and other countries.

The '''ZERO foundation''' is a [[Germany|German]] cultural institute, established in December 2008, with support of Düsseldorf-based [[Zero (art)|ZERO]] artists, [[Heinz Mack]], [[Otto Piene]] and [[Günther Uecker]], and [[Museum Kunst Palast]]. It is funded by the state capital [[Düsseldorf]]. The artists donated works as well as their archives from the ZERO period comprising photographs, correspondence, invitation cards, newspaper clippings and other documents. The initiative behind the foundation was taken by [[Mattijs Visser]].  '''Founding Director''' 2009-2017, now: [https://www.0-projects.info/about.html Mattijs Visser].

== Organisation ==
* '''Staff''': Dr. Barbara Könches, director; Dr. Tiziana Caianiello, Katrin Lohe, Laura Weber, Thekla Zell.
* '''Board of Directors''': Dr. Friderike Bagel, Claus Gielisch, Dr. Felix Krämer, Harry Schmitz, Professor Dr. Jürgen Wilhelm.

==Collection==

The foundation has important works mainly from [[Heinz Mack]], [[Otto Piene]], [[Günther Uecker]], and other artists from the ZERO movement.

== Past activities ==

The ZERO foundation was established in 2008 by the Düsseldorf ZERO artists Heinz Mack, Otto Piene, and Günther Uecker together with the Museum Kunstpalast initiated by Mattijs Visser. The mission of the ZERO foundation is to preserve, present, study, and support the work of the international ZERO movement. 

For this purpose the artists donated numerous works and their archives from the ZERO period, including important documents such as photographs, correspondence, posters, invitations, press articles, and magazines. Over the last few years additional works and documents of the international ZERO avantgarde have been collected and made available to the public and international scholars through the development of exhibition projects and publications. These efforts are not only focused on the ZERO period itself (1958-1966) but also on the continuing impact of ZERO into present. The archive and library of the ZERO foundation are available for research purposes. 

A unique aspect of the ZERO foundation is that the living artists are actively involved in the work of the organization. First-hand information about the ZERO period can be passed on and integrated into scholarship on the movement.
