'''Adaptive Insights, a Workday company''', formerly '''Adaptive Planning, Inc.''', is a [[software as a service]] company headquartered in [[Palo Alto, California]] founded in 2003. Its Business Planning Cloud lets people in companies collaborate, gain insights, and make smarter decisions faster. The company's acquisition by [[Workday, Inc.]] was completed in August 2018.

==History==
In 2003, Robert S. Hull and Richard L. Dellinger co-founded Adaptive Planning to market enterprise budgeting, forecasting, and reporting software as an alternative to [[spreadsheet]]-based planning or larger, [[on-premises software]].  Adaptive Planning was an early user of the software as a service (SaaS) model for [[business intelligence]] and corporate performance management.
The company was funded in late 2003 and incorporated in Delaware as Visus Technology and then renamed to Adaptive Planning.  It was incubated at Onset Ventures in [[Menlo Park, California]]. In September 2012 the company acquired the [[Louisville, Colorado]] based company ''myDIALS'' for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adaptive-planning-acquires-mydials-ushers-044651362.html|title=Adaptive Planning Acquires myDIALS|last=|first=|date=2012-09-10|website=finance.yahoo.com|publisher=Yahoo Finance|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October 2013 Adaptive Planning held a fourth round of funding, raising $45 million and added [[salesforce.com]] as a backer.&lt;ref&gt;http://fortune.com/2013/10/30/venture-capital-deals-435/&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, Adaptive Planning was renamed Adaptive Insights and released a new version of the software with an updated user interface.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/business-intelligence/adaptive-planning-gets-new-brand.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, the company appointed Citrix Chairman Tom Bogan as CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2015/01/13/citrix-adaptive-insights-ceo/|title=Citrix chairman joins cloud financials pioneer as CEO|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015 the company reported another investment round of $75 million with several investors, including [[Norwest Venture Partners]], ONSET Ventures, [[Bessemer Venture Partners]], Cardinal Venture Capital, Information Venture Partners, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/30/finance-business-intelligence-startup-adaptive-insights-gets-75m-reportedly-at-a-unicorn-valuation/|title=Cloud Finance Intelligence Startup Adaptive Insights Gets $75M, Reportedly At A Unicorn Valuation|last=Lunden|first=Ingrid|date=2015-06-30|website=techcrunch.com|publisher=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, Adaptive Insights appeared in the Leaders Quadrant of a Gartner Strategic CPM report and marked the first time a cloud-only vendor was in the leaders section of the Strategic CPM Magic Quadrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adaptiveinsights.com/newsroom/press/adaptive-insights-positioned-as-a-leader-in-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-strategic|title=Adaptive Insights Labeled Leader in Corporate Performance Management|website=www.adaptiveinsights.com|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Gartner included only cloud companies in its 2017 Magic Quadrant for Cloud Strategic Corporate Performance Management Solutions report. Adaptive Insights was placed highest in the Leaders quadrant for ability to execute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adaptiveinsights.com/newsroom/press/adaptive-insights-positioned-as-a-leader-in-magic-quadrant-for-cloud-strategic|title=Adaptive Insights Positioned as a Leader in Magic Quadrant for Cloud Strategic Corporate Performance Management Solutions {{!}} Adaptive Insights|website=www.adaptiveinsights.com|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, the company surpassed $100 million in annualized revenue,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/04/20/adaptive-insights-ceo-tom-bogan.html|title=Seasoned Silicon Valley exec leads Adaptive Insights across $100M mar|website=www.bizjournals.com|access-date=2018-04-30|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; an accomplishment that fewer than 1% of software companies achieve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adaptiveinsights.com/newsroom/press/adaptive-insights-surpasses-100m-in-annualized-revenue-as-cloud-planning-market|title=Adaptive Insights Surpasses $100M in Annualized Revenue as Cloud Planning Market Expands {{!}} Adaptive Insights|website=www.adaptiveinsights.com|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, the company announced it added 500 net new customers in fiscal 2018 and currently has more than 3,700 customers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://channellife.com.au/story/adaptive-insights-announces-stellar-year-fy18/|title=Adaptive Insights announces a stellar year for FY18|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, [[Workday, Inc.|Workday]] agreed to acquire Adaptive Insights for approximately $1.55 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/06/11/1519525/0/en/Workday-Announces-Acquisition-of-Adaptive-Insights.html|title=Workday Announces Acquisition of Adaptive Insights|last=Inc.|first=Workday,|work=GlobeNewswire News Room|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, [[Workday, Inc.|Workday]] completed the acquisition of Adaptive Insights, announcing that the company would operate as Adaptive Insights, a Workday company. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/08/01/1545549/0/en/Workday-Completes-Acquisition-of-Adaptive-Insights.html|title=Workday Completes Acquisition of Adaptive Insights|last=Inc.|first=Workday,|work=GlobeNewswire News Room|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anti-consumerism |Movements}}
The '''anti-globalization movement''', or '''counter-globalisation movement''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Derrida]] (May 2004) ''[http://mondediplo.com/2004/11/06derrida Enlightenment past and to come]'', speech at the party for 50 years of ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]''&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[social movement]] critical of [[economic globalization]]. The movement is also commonly referred to as the [[global justice movement]],&lt;ref name=DDP&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Della Porta | editor-first = Donatella | editor-link = Donatella della Porta | title = The Global Justice Movement: Cross-national And Transnational Perspectives | publisher = Paradigm | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-1-59451-305-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[alter-globalization]] movement, anti-globalist movement, [[anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] globalization movement,&lt;ref name=Juris&gt;{{cite book | last = Juris | first = Jeffrey S. | title =
Networking Futures: The Movements against Corporate Globalization | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 2008 | page = 2 | isbn = 978-0-8223-4269-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; or movement against [[neoliberal]] globalization.

Participants base their criticisms on a number of related ideas.&lt;ref&gt;No Logo: No Space, No Choice, No Jobs by Canadian journalist Naomi Klein.&lt;/ref&gt;  What is shared is that participants oppose large, [[multinational corporation]]s having unregulated political power, exercised through [[trade agreements]] and deregulated financial markets. Specifically, corporations are accused of seeking to maximize profit at the expense of work safety conditions and standards, labour hiring and compensation standards, environmental conservation principles, and the integrity of national legislative authority, independence and sovereignty. {{as of|2012|January}}, some commentators have characterized changes in the global economy as "turbo-capitalism" ([[Edward Luttwak]]), "[[market fundamentalism]]" ([[George Soros]]), [[Casino Capitalism|"casino capitalism"]] ([[Susan Strange]]),&lt;ref&gt;Strange, Susan: Casino Capitalism. Oxford: Blackwell, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; and as "McWorld" ([[Benjamin Barber]]).

Many anti-globalization activists do not oppose [[globalization]] in general and call for forms of global integration that better provide [[democratic representation]], advancement of [[human rights]], [[fair trade]] and [[sustainable development]] and therefore feel the term "anti-globalization" is misleading.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Douglas ''[http://www3.fis.utoronto.ca/research/iprp/c3n/CI/DMorris.htm Globalization and Media Democracy: The Case of Indymedia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304030415/http://www3.fis.utoronto.ca/research/iprp/c3n/CI/DMorris.htm |date=2009-03-04 }}'' (pre-publication version)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Podobnik, Bruce, ''[http://convention.allacademic.com/asa2003/view_paper_info.html?pub_id=179&amp;part_id1=13161 Resistance to Globalization: Cycles and Evolutions in the Globalization Protest Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228081453/http://convention.allacademic.com/asa2003/view_paper_info.html?pub_id=179&amp;part_id1=13161 |date=2008-02-28 }}'', p. 2. Podobnik states that "the vast majority of groups that participate in these protests draw on international networks of support, and they generally call for forms of globalization that enhance democratic representation, human rights, and egalitarianism."  {{cite web|url=http://convention.allacademic.com/asa2003/view_paper_info.html?pub_id=179&amp;part_id1=13161 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228081453/http://convention.allacademic.com/asa2003/view_paper_info.html?pub_id=179&amp;part_id1=13161 |archivedate=February 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph &amp; Andrew Charlton. 2005. ''Fair Trade for All: How Trade Can Promote Development''. p. 54 n. 23 (writing that "The anti-globalization movement developed in opposition to the perceived negative aspects of globalization. The term 'anti-globalization' is in many ways a misnomer, since the group represents a wide range of interests and issues and many of the people involved in the anti-globalization movement do support closer ties between the various peoples and cultures of the world through, for example, aid, assistance for refugees, and global environmental issues.")&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology and causes==
{{Main|Criticisms of globalization}}
Supporters believe that by the late 20th century those they characterized as "ruling elites" sought to harness the expansion of world markets for their own interests; this combination of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] institutions, states, and multinational corporations has been called "[[globalization]]" or "globalization from above." In reaction, various social movements emerged to challenge their influence; these movements have been called "anti-globalization" or "globalization from below."&lt;ref&gt;Korzeniewicz, Roberto Patricio &amp; Smith, William C., 2001, ''Protest and Collaboration: Transnational Civil Society Networks and the Politics of Summitry and Free Trade in the Americas'', pp. 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to international financial institutions and transnational corporations===
People opposing globalization believe that international agreements and global financial institutions, such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Trade Organization]], undermine local decision-making. Corporations that use these institutions to support their own corporate and financial interests, can exercise privileges that individuals and small businesses cannot,&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E., "Globalism's Discontents", The American Prospect, 13, 1, January 2002, PP. 1-14&lt;/ref&gt; including the ability to:
# move freely across borders.
# extract desired [[natural resources]].
# use a wide variety of [[human resources]].
The movement aims for an end to the legal status of "[[Juristic person|corporate personhood]]" and the dissolution of [[free market fundamentalism]] and the radical economic privatization measures of the [[World Bank]], the IMF, and the World Trade Organization.

Activists are especially opposed to the various abuses which they think are perpetuated by globalization and the international institutions that, they say, promote [[neoliberalism]] without regard to ethical standards or environmental protection.&lt;ref name="Bakari13"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakari|first=Mohamed El-Kamel|title=Globalization and Sustainable Development: False Twins?|journal=New Global Studies|volume=7|issue=3|pages=23–56|issn=1940-0004|doi=10.1515/ngs-2013-021|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common targets include the [[World Bank]] (WB), [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and [[free trade]] treaties like the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA), the Trans Pacific Trade Agreement (TPPA), the [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (MAI) and the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS). In light of the economic gap between rich and poor countries, adherents of the movement claim that free trade without measures to protect the environment and the health and wellbeing of workers will merely increase the power of industrialized nations (often termed the "North" in opposition to the developing world's "South"). Proponents of this line of thought refer to the process as polarization and argue that current neo-liberal economic policies have given wealthier states an advantage over developing nations, enabling their exploitation and leading to a widening of the global wealth gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Byrne, Hensby|first=Darren J., Alexander|title=Theorizing Global Studies|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=UK|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by [[Jean Ziegler]], [[UN Special Rapporteur]] on the [[right to food]], notes that "millions of farmers are losing their livelihoods in the developing countries, but small farmers in the northern countries are also suffering" and concludes that "the current inequities of the global trading system are being perpetuated rather than resolved under the WTO, given the unequal balance of power between member countries."&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, Jean, 2004, [http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/34441bf9efe3a9e3c1256e6300510e24/$FILE/G0410777.pdf ''Economic, social and cultural rights - The right to food''], page 9&lt;/ref&gt;  Activists point to the unequal footing and power between developed and developing nations within the WTO and with respect to global trade, most specifically in relation to the protectionist policies towards agriculture enacted in many developed countries. These activists also point out that heavy subsidization of developed nations' agriculture and the aggressive use of export subsidies by some developed nations to make their agricultural products more attractive on the international market are major causes of declines in the agricultural sectors of many developing nations.

===Global opposition to neoliberalism===
Through the [[Internet]], a movement began to develop in opposition to the doctrines of [[neoliberalism]] which were widely manifested in the 1990s when the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) proposed liberalization of cross-border investment and trade restrictions through its [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (MAI). This treaty was prematurely exposed to public scrutiny and subsequently abandoned in November 1998 in the face of strenuous protest and criticism by national and international [[civil society]] representatives.

Neoliberal doctrine argued that untrammeled [[free trade]] and reduction of public-sector regulation would bring benefits to poor countries and to disadvantaged people in rich countries. Anti-globalization advocates urge that preservation of the natural environment, human rights (especially workplace rights and conditions) and democratic institutions are likely to be placed at undue risk by globalization unless mandatory standards are attached to liberalization. [[Noam Chomsky]] stated in 2002 that
{{quote|The term "globalization" has been appropriated by the powerful to refer to a specific form of international economic integration, one based on investor rights, with the interests of people incidental. That is why the business press, in its more honest moments, refers to the "free trade agreements" as "free investment agreements" (Wall St. Journal). Accordingly, advocates of other forms of globalization are described as "anti-globalization"; and some, unfortunately, even accept this term, though it is a term of [[propaganda]] that should be dismissed with ridicule. No sane person is opposed to globalization, that is, international integration. Surely not the left and the workers movements, which were founded on the principle of international solidarity—that is, globalization in a form that attends to the rights of people, not private power systems.&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky Znet May 07, 2002 / The Croatian Feral Tribune April 27, 2002 {{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/content/TerrorWar/chomskygab.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070807064137/https://www.zmag.org/content/TerrorWar/chomskygab.cfm |archivedate=August 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Anti-war movement===
{{Main|Anti-war movement}}
By 2002, many parts of the movement showed wide opposition to the impending [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. Many participants were among those 11 million or more protesters that on the weekend of February 15, 2003, participated in global [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|protests against the imminent Iraq war]]. Other anti-war demonstrations were [[Community organizing|organized]] by the antiglobalization movement: see for example the large demonstration, organized against the impending war in Iraq, which closed the first [[European Social Forum]] in November 2002 in [[Florence]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/1109-01.htm |title="Half-A-Million March in Anti-War Rally in Italy", ''Reuters'', November 9, 2002, Luke Baker |publisher=Commondreams.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK20uY9X?url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/1109-01.htm |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-globalization militants worried for a proper functioning of democratic institutions as the leaders of many democratic countries ([[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]] and the [[United Kingdom]]) were acting against the wishes of the majorities of their populations in supporting the war.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, 2003, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/29/spain.iraq .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, 2003, https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/feb/18/politics.iraq&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky asserted that these leaders "showed their contempt for democracy". Critics of this type of argument have tended to point out that this is just a standard criticism of [[representative democracy]] — a democratically elected government will not always act in the direction of greatest current public support — and that, therefore, there is no inconsistency in the leaders' positions given that these countries are [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracies]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The [[economics|economic]] and [[war|military]] issues are closely linked in the eyes of many within the movement.

===Appropriateness of the term===
Many participants (see Noam Chomsky's quotes above) consider the term "anti-globalization" to be a [[misnomer]]. The term suggests that its followers support [[protectionism]] and/or [[nationalism]], which is not always the case - in fact, some supporters of anti-globalization are strong opponents of both nationalism and protectionism: for example, the [[No Border network]] argues for unrestricted migration and the abolition of all national border controls. S. A. Hamed Hosseini (an Australian sociologist and expert in global social movement studies), argues that the term anti-globalization can be ideal-typically used only to refer to only one ideological vision he detects alongside three other visions (the [[anti-globalist]], the [[alter-globalist]] and the [[alter-globalization]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hosseini|first=S A Hamed|title=Alternative globalizations: an integrative approach to studying dissident knowledge in the global justice movement|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-49476-2|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415494762/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the three latter ideal-typical visions can be categorized under the title of [[global justice movement]]. According to him, while the first two visions (the alter-globalism and the anti-globalism) represent the reconstructed forms of old and new left ideologies, respectively, in the context of current globalization, only the third one has shown the capacity to respond more effectively to the intellectual requirements of today's [[global complexities]]. Underlying this vision is a new conception of justice, coined [[accommodative justice]] by Hosseini,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hosseini|first=S A Hamed|title=Global Complexities and the Rise of Global Justice Movement: A New Notion of Justice|journal=The Global Studies Journal|year=2009|volume=2|issue=3|pages=15–36|url=http://gsj.cgpublisher.com/product/pub.184/prod.118}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new approach towards cosmopolitanism ([[transversal cosmopolitanism]]), a new mode of [[activist knowledge]] ([[accommodative consciousness]]), and a new format of solidarity, [[interactive solidarity]].

Some activists, notably [[David Graeber]], see the movement as opposed instead to [[neoliberalism]] or "[[corporate globalization]]". He argues that the term "anti-globalization" is a term coined by the media, and that radical activists are actually more in favor of globalization, in the sense of "effacement of borders and the free movement of people, possessions and ideas" than are the IMF or WTO. He also notes that activists use the terms "globalization movement" and "anti-globalization movement" interchangeably, indicating the confusion of the terminology. The term "alter-globalization" has been used to make this distinction clear.

While the term "anti-globalization" arose from the movement's opposition to [[free-trade]] agreements (which have often been considered part of something called "[[globalization]]"), various participants contend they are opposed to only certain aspects of globalization and instead describe themselves, at least in French-speaking organizations, as "[[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]]", "anti-[[plutocracy]]," or "anti-[[corporation|corporate]]." ''[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]'' 's editor, [[Ignacio Ramonet]]'s, expression of "the one-way thought" (''[[pensée unique]]'') became slang against [[neoliberal]] policies and the [[Washington consensus]].&lt;ref name="ramonet"&gt;{{cite news|title=La pensée unique |publisher=Le Monde Diplomatique |date=January 1995 |url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1995/01/RAMONET/1144 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK21qVRY?url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1995/01/RAMONET/1144 |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civic and Racial Nationalist opposition against globalization===

The term "anti-globalization" does not distinguish the international [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] anti-globalization position from a strictly nationalist anti-globalization position. Many nationalist movements, such as the [[France|French]] [[National Front (France)|National Front]], [[Freedom Party of Austria|Austrian Freedom Party]], the Italian [[Lega Nord]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Zaslove | first = Andrej | title = Exclusion, community, and a populist political economy: the radical right as an anti-globalization movement | journal = [[Comparative European Politics]] | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–189 | doi = 10.1057/palgrave.cep.6110126 | date = July 2008 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Greece|Greek]] [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/the-golden-dawn-a-love-of-power-and-a-hatred-of-difference-on-the-rise-in-the-cradle-of-democracy-8210724.html|title=The Golden Dawn: A love of power and a hatred of difference on the|date=14 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-g8-summit-protests-idUSL0720733520070607 | title=German police capsize protesters' boats at G8| newspaper=Reuters| date=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; are opposed to globalization, but argue that the alternative to globalization is the protection of the [[nation-state]]. Other groups, influenced by the [[Third Position]], are also classifiable as anti-globalization. However, their overall world view is rejected by groups such as [[Peoples Global Action]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups such as [[Antifa (United States)|ANTIFA]]. In response, the nationalist movements against globalization, argue that the [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] anti-globalization position is actually a support to [[alter-globalization]].

===Influences===

[[File:Anti WEF graffiti Lausanne.jpg|thumb|Anti-[[World Economic Forum|WEF]] graffiti in [[Lausanne]]. The writing reads: ''La croissance est une folie'' ("Growth is madness").]]

Several influential critical works have inspired the anti-globalization movement. ''[[No Logo]]'', the book by the Canadian journalist [[Naomi Klein]] who criticized the production practices of multinational corporations and the omnipresence of brand-driven marketing in [[popular culture]], has become "manifesto"&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Gaby. "[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/nov/12/globalisation.politicsphilosophyandsociety Look, no brands...]", ''The Observer'', November 12, 2000. Retrieved on December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; of the movement, presenting in a simple way themes more accurately developed in other works. In India some intellectual references of the movement can be found in the works of [[Vandana Shiva]], an ecologist and feminist, who in her book ''[[Biopiracy]]'' documents the way that the [[natural capital]] of [[indigenous peoples]] and [[ecoregions]] is converted into forms of [[intellectual capital]], which are then recognized as [[exclusive right|exclusive]] commercial property without sharing the private utility thus derived. The writer [[Arundhati Roy]] is famous for her anti-nuclear position and her activism against India's massive hydroelectric dam project, sponsored by the [[World Bank]]. In France the well-known monthly paper ''[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]'' has advocated the antiglobalization cause and an editorial of its director [[Ignacio Ramonet]] brought about the foundation of the association [[ATTAC]]. [[Susan George (political scientist)|Susan George]] of the Transnational Institute has also been a long-term influence on the movement, as the writer of books since 1986 on hunger, debt, international financial institutions and capitalism. The works of [[Jean Ziegler]], [[Christopher Chase-Dunn]], and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] have detailed underdevelopment and dependence in a world ruled by the capitalist system. Pacifist and anti-imperialist traditions have strongly influenced the movement. Critics of [[United States foreign policy]] such as [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Susan Sontag]], and anti-globalist pranksters [[The Yes Men]] are widely accepted inside the movement.

Although they may not recognize themselves as antiglobalists and are pro-capitalism, some economists who don't share the neoliberal approach of international economic institutions have strongly influenced the movement. [[Amartya Sen]]'s ''Development as Freedom'' ([[The Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Prize in Economics]], 1999), argues that third world development must be understood as the expansion of human capability, not simply the increase in national income per capita, and thus requires policies attuned to health and education, not simply GDP. [[James Tobin]]'s (winner of the [[The Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|Nobel Prize in Economics]]) proposal for a tax on financial transactions (called, after him, the [[Tobin tax]]) has become part of the agenda of the movement. Also, [[George Soros]], [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] (another Economic Sciences Nobel prize winner, formerly of the World Bank, author of [[Globalization and Its Discontents]]) and [[David Korten]] have made arguments for drastically improving [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]], for [[debt relief]], [[land reform]], and restructuring [[corporate accountability]] systems. Korten and Stiglitz's contribution to the movement include involvement in [[direct action]]s and street protest.

In some Roman Catholic countries such as [[Italy]] there have been religious influences, especially from missionaries who have spent a long time in the [[Third World]] (the most famous being [[Alex Zanotelli]]).

Internet sources and free-information websites, such as [[Indymedia]], are a means of diffusion of the movement's ideas. The vast array of material on spiritual movements, [[anarchism]], [[libertarian socialism]] and the [[Green politics|Green Movement]] that is now available on the Internet has been perhaps more influential than any printed book.

==Organization==
[[File:EdinburghProtests5.jpg|thumb|Anti-globalization protests in [[Edinburgh]] during the start of the [[31st G8 summit]].]]

Although over the past years more emphasis has been given to the construction of grassroots alternatives to (capitalist) globalization, the movement's largest and most visible mode of organizing remains mass decentralized campaigns of direct action and civil disobedience. &lt;!-- These often coincide with meetings of organizations they object to. It wasn't us, Guv? Speculation - activists form a spectrum of views --&gt; This mode of organizing, sometimes under the banner of the [[Peoples' Global Action]] network, tries to tie the many disparate causes together into one global struggle.
&lt;!-- In the process, it also helps to focus global attention both on the institutions of global capitalism (whose policies most movement members feel people would object to if they knew about them) as well as bring attention to the movement itself. Rewrite needed. --&gt;
In many ways the process of organizing matters overall can be more important to activists than the avowed goals or achievements of any component of the movement.

At corporate summits, the stated goal of most demonstrations is to stop the proceedings. Although the demonstrations rarely succeed in more than delaying or inconveniencing the actual summits, this motivates the mobilizations and gives them a visible, short-term purpose. This form of publicity is expensive in police time and the public purse. Rioting has occurred at some protests, for instance in Genoa, Seattle and London - and extensive damage was done to the area, especially targeting corporations, including [[McDonald's]] and [[Starbucks]] restaurants.

Despite, or perhaps because of, the lack of formal coordinating bodies, the movement manages to successfully organize large protests on a global basis, using [[information technology]] to spread information and organize. Protesters organize themselves into "[[affinity group]]s," typically non-hierarchical groups of people who live close together and share a common political goal. Affinity groups will then send representatives to planning meetings. However, because these groups can be infiltrated by law enforcement intelligence, important plans of the protests are often not made until the last minute. One common tactic of the protests is to split up based on willingness to break the law. This is designed, with varying success, to protect the risk-averse from the physical and legal dangers posed by confrontations with law enforcement. For example, in [[Prague]] during the [[Anti-globalization Protests in Prague|anti-IMF and World Bank protests in September 2000]] demonstrators split into three distinct groups, approaching the conference center from three directions: one engaging in various forms of civil disobedience (the Yellow march), one (the Pink/Silver march) advancing through "[[tactical frivolity]]" (costume, dance, theatre, music, and artwork), and one (the Blue march) engaging in violent conflicts with the baton-armed police, with the protesters throwing cobblestones lifted from the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vidal |first1=John |last2=Connolly |first2=Kate |url=https://www.theguardian.com/imf/story/0,7369,373703,00.html |title=Barricades burn in battle of Prague |publisher=Guardian |date=2000-09-27 |accessdate=2010-09-20 |location=London |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK23lvLX?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/imf/story/0%2C7369%2C373703%2C00.html |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Most police forces of developed nations do not have water cannons --&gt;
These demonstrations come to resemble small societies in themselves. Many protesters take training in first aid and act as medics to other injured protesters. In the US, some organizations like the [[National Lawyer's Guild]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], provide legal witnesses in case of law enforcement confrontation. Protesters often claim that major media outlets do not properly report on them; therefore, some of them created the [[Independent Media Center]], a collective of protesters reporting on the actions as they happen.

A counter summit against G7 was organized in Paris in July 1989. The event was called "ça suffit comme ça" ("that is enough") and principally aimed at cancelling the debt contracted by southern countries. A demonstration gathered 10,000 people and an important concert was held in la Bastille square with 200 000 people. It was the first anti-G7 event, fourteen years before that of Washington. The main political consequence was that France took position to favor debt cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Japan and the G7/8: 1975-2002 | publisher=Routledge | author=Dobson, Hugo | pages=79–80 | isbn=978-0-415-64933-9| date=2013-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They tried to drown the bankers' parties in noise from outside and held other public forms of protest under the motto "50 Years is Enough". While Spanish [[King Juan Carlos]] was addressing the participants in a huge exhibition hall, two [[Greenpeace]] activists climbed to the top and showered the attendants with fake dollar bills carrying the slogan "No $s for [[Ozone Layer]] Destruction". A number of the demonstrators were sent to the notorious [[Carabanchel prison]].

===Law enforcement reaction===
Although local police were surprised by the size of N30, law enforcement agencies have since reacted worldwide to prevent the disruption of future events by a variety of tactics, including sheer weight of numbers, infiltrating the groups to determine their plans, and preparations for the use of force to remove protesters.

At the site of some of the protests, police have used tear gas, pepper spray, concussion grenades, rubber and wooden bullets, night sticks, water cannons, [[police dog|dogs]], and horses to repel the protesters. After the November 2000 [[G20]] protest in [[List of demonstrations against corporate globalization#2000|Montreal]], at which many protesters were beaten, trampled, and arrested in what was intended to be a festive protest, the tactic of dividing protests into "green" (permitted), "yellow" (not officially permitted but with little confrontation and low risk of arrest), and "red" (involving direct confrontation) zones was introduced.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

In [[Quebec City]], municipal officials built a 3-metre (10&amp;nbsp;ft) high wall around the portion of the city where the [[Quebec City Summit of the Americas|Summit of the Americas]] was being held, which only residents, delegates to the summit, and certain accredited journalists were allowed to pass through.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

===Gothenburg===
[[File:Polisattack.jpg|thumb|Attack of police during the riots in Gothenburg, 15 June 2001]]
{{Main|Protests during the EU summit in Gothenburg 2001}}
On June 15 and 16, 2001, a strong demonstration took place in [[Göteborg]] during the meeting of the European Council in the Swedish town. Clashes between police and protesters were exacerbated by the numerous vandalism of the extreme fringes of the demonstrators, the so-called [[black-bloc]]s. Images of devastation bounced through the mass media, putting a negative shadow on the movement, and increasing a sense of fear through common people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.de/umleitung/2002/deu03/107?lang=de&amp;mimetype=text/html&amp;destination=node%2F3006%3Fpage%3D1|title=Schweden - Amnesty International Deutschland|work=amnesty.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genoa===
{{Main|27th G8 summit#Protests}}
The [[Genoa Group of Eight Summit protest]] from July 18 to July 22, 2001 was one of the bloodiest protests in Western Europe's recent history, as evidenced by the wounding of hundreds of policemen and civilians forced to lock themselves inside of their homes and the death of a young Genoese [[anarchist]] named [[Carlo Giuliani]]—who was shot while trying to throw a fire extinguisher on a policeman—during two days of violence and rioting by groups supported by the nonchalance of more consistent and peaceful masses of protesters, and the hospitalization of several of those peaceful demonstrators just mentioned. Police have subsequently been accused of brutality, torture and interference with the non-violent protests as a collateral damage provoked by the clash between the law enforcement ranks themselves and the more violent and brutal fringes of protesters, who repeatedly hid themselves amongst peaceful protesters of all ages and backgrounds. Several hundred peaceful demonstrators, rioters, and police were injured and hundreds were arrested during the days surrounding the G8 meeting; most of those arrested have been charged with some form of "criminal association" under Italy's anti-[[mafia]] and anti-[[terrorism|terrorist]] laws.

===International social forums===
:{{main|Social forum|European Social Forum|Asian Social Forum|World Social Forum}}
The first [[World Social Forum]] (WSF) in 2001 was an initiative of {{ill|Oded Grajew|pt}}, [[Chico Whitaker]], and [[Bernard Cassen]]. It was supported by the city of [[Porto Alegre]] (where it took place) and the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Brazilian Worker's Party]]. The motivation was to constitute a counter-event to the [[World Economic Forum]] held in [[Davos]] at the same time. The slogan of the WSF is "Another World Is Possible". An ''International Council'' (IC) was set up to discuss and decide major issues regarding the WSF, while the local organizing committee in the host city is responsible for the practical preparations of the event.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=3_2&amp;cd_language=2 International Council]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=4_1&amp;cd_language=2 |title=Fórum Social Mundial |publisher=Forumsocialmundial.org.br |date=2005-10-26 |accessdate=2010-05-18 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2Yzw4g?url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=4_1&amp;cd_language=2 |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2001, the IC adopted the World Social Forum Charter of Principles, which provides a framework for international, national, and local Social Forums worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=4&amp;cd_language=2 |title=World Social Forum Charter of Principles |publisher=Forumsocialmundial.org.br |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2ZvbQY?url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/main.php?id_menu=4&amp;cd_language=2 |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WSF became a periodic meeting: in 2002 and 2003 it was held again in Porto Alegre and became a rallying point for worldwide protest against the American invasion of Iraq. In 2004 it was moved to [[Mumbai]], [[India]]), to make it more accessible to the populations of Asia and Africa. This Forum had 75,000 delegates. In 2006 it was held in three cities: [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]], [[Bamako]], [[Mali]], and [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]]. In 2007, the Forum was hosted in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], in 2009 it was in [[Belém]], Brazil, and in 2011 it was in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]]. In 2012, the WSF returned to Porto Alegre.

The idea of creating a meeting place for organizations and individuals opposed to [[Neoliberalism]] was soon replicated elsewhere. The first [[European Social Forum]] (ESF) was held in November 2002 in [[Florence]]. The slogan was "Against the war, against racism and against neo-liberalism". It saw the participation of 60,000 delegates and ended with a huge demonstration against the war (1,000,000 people according to the organizers). The following ESFs took place in [[Paris]] (2003), [[London]] (2004), [[Athens]] (2006), [[Malmö]] (2008), and the latest ESF in [[Istanbul]] (2010).

In many countries Social Forums of national and local scope were also held.

Recently there has been some discussion behind the movement about the role of the social forums. Some see them as a "popular university", an occasion to make many people aware of the problems of globalization. Others would prefer that delegates concentrate their efforts on the coordination and organization of the movement and on the planning of new campaigns. However it has often been argued that in the dominated countries (most of the world) the WSF is little more than an 'NGO fair' driven by Northern NGOs and donors most of which are hostile to popular movements of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/features/39464 |title=Pambazuka News |publisher=Pambazuka.org |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2b4Eev?url=http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/features/39464 |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North Korea ===
After the Second World War, North Korea followed a policy of  Anti-Globalization. However, in recent decades have shown a distinctive rise in globalization movements in North Korea. Under the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, Pyongyang(2002), introduced a number of reforms in areas such as technology and trade. The reform that had the most significance to North Korea was trade. North Korea saw a change in trading partnerships. They now not only traded with themselves but also with South Korea and China. North Korea introduced these reforms because they were lacking in areas of technology and trade and they realized that they could not maintain themselves as a society without help from other. But even with these new reforms North Korea still remains the most isolated society in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Chanlett-Avery and Nanto, Dick North Korea: Economic Leverage and Policy Analysis.Congressional Research Service ,2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
The anti-globalization movement has been criticized by politicians, members of [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[think tank]]s, and many mainstream [[economists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sofi.su.se/wp/WP06-7.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625032200/http://www.sofi.su.se/wp/WP06-7.pdf |date=June 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of evidence===
Critics assert that the empirical evidence does not support the views of the anti-globalization movement. These critics point to statistical trends which are interpreted to be results of globalization, capitalism, and the economic growth they encourage.

Members of the anti-globalization movement argue that positive data from countries which largely ignored neoliberal prescriptions, notably China, discredits the evidence that pro-globalists present. For example, concerning the parameter of per capita income growth, development economist [[Ha-Joon Chang]] writes that considering the record of the last two decades the argument for continuing neo-liberal policy prescriptions are "simply untenable." Noting that "It depends on the data we use, but roughly speaking, per capita income in developing countries grew at 3% per year between 1960 and 1980, but has grown only at about 1.5% between 1980 and 2000. And even this 1.5% will be reduced to 1%, if we take out India and China, which have not pursued liberal trade and industrial policies recommended by the developed countries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpif.org/pdf/papers/SRtrade2003.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709044054/http://www.fpif.org/pdf/papers/SRtrade2003.pdf |date=July 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jagdish Bhagwati]] argues that reforms that opened up the economies of China and India contributed to their higher growth in 1980s and 1990s. From 1980 to 2000 their GDP grew at average rate of 10 and 6 percent respectively. This was accompanied by reduction of poverty from 28 percent in 1978 to 9 percent in 1998 in China, and from 51 percent in 1978 to 26 percent in 2000 in India.&lt;ref&gt;Jagdish N. Bhagwati. ''In Defense of Globalization.'' (2004). Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-517025-2}} p.65&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Joseph E. Stiglitz, speaking not only on China but East Asia in general, comments "The countries that have managed globalization...such as those in East Asia, have, by and large, ensured that they reaped huge benefits..."&lt;ref&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E., "Globalism's Discontents," The American Prospect, 13, 1, January 2002, pp. 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[The Heritage Foundation]], development in China was anticipated by [[Milton Friedman]], who predicted that even a small progress towards economic liberalization would produce dramatic and positive effects. China's economy had grown together with its [[economic freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/Research/TradeandForeignAid/upload/wm_1375.pdf wm_1375.fm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626175616/http://www.heritage.org/Research/TradeandForeignAid/upload/wm_1375.pdf |date=June 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of corporate-led globalization have expressed concern about the methodology used in arriving at the World Bank's statistics and argue that more detailed variables measuring poverty should be studied.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.columbia.edu/~sr793/truth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/trade_2004_11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]] (CEPR), the period from 1980–2005 has seen diminished progress in terms of economic growth, life expectancy, infant and child mortality, and to a lesser extent education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/development_2005_09.pdf |title=trade_2004_01_08-1 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2mRYrK?url=http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/development_2005_09.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disorganization===
One of the most common criticisms of the movement, which does not necessarily come from its opponents, is simply that the anti-globalization movement lacks coherent goals, and that the views of different protesters are often in opposition to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Takis Fotopoulos, ''The Multidimensional Crisis and Inclusive Democracy'', ch. 4 ''[http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/fotopoulos/english/brbooks/multi_crisis_id/ch4.htm 'Globalisation' and the Left]''&lt;/ref&gt; Many members of the movement are also aware of this, and argue that, as long as they have a common opponent, they should march together - even if they don't share exactly the same political vision. Writers [[Michael Hardt]] &amp; [[Antonio Negri]] have together in their books (''Empire'' &amp;'' Multitude'') expanded on this idea of a disunified [[multitude]]: humans coming together for shared causes, but lacking the complete sameness of the notion of 'the people'.

===Lack of effectiveness===
One argument often made by the opponents of the anti-globalization movement (especially by ''[[The Economist]]''), is that one of the major causes of poverty amongst third-world farmers are the trade barriers put up by rich nations and poor nations alike. The [[WTO]] is an organization set up to work towards removing those trade barriers. Therefore, it is argued, people really concerned about the plight of the third world should actually be encouraging free trade, rather than attempting to fight it. Specifically, commodities such as sugar are heavily distorted by subsidies on behalf of powerful economies (the United States, Europe, and Japan), who have a disproportionate influence in the WTO. As a result, producers in these countries often receive 2-3x the world market price. As Amani Elobeid and John Beghin note, the world price might decline by as much as 48% (by 2011 / 2012 baselines) were these distortions to be removed&lt;ref&gt;Elobeid, Amani; Beghin, John. "Multilateral Trade and Agricultural Policy Reforms in Sugar Markets", Journal of Agricultural Economics, 57, 1, 23-48, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many supporters of globalization think that policies different from those of today should be pursued, although not necessarily those advocated by the anti-globalization movement. For example, some see the World Bank and the IMF as corrupt bureaucracies which have given repeated loans to dictators who never do any reforms. Some, like [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando De Soto]], argue that much of the poverty in the Third World countries is caused by the lack of Western systems of laws and well-defined and universally recognized [[property rights]]. De Soto argues that because of the legal barriers poor people in those countries can not utilize their assets to produce more wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Hernando De Soto. ''The Mystery of Capital''. Basic Books. (2003). {{ISBN|978-0-465-01615-0}} p.210-211&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of widespread "Third World" support===
Critics have asserted that people from poor (the [[Developing country|Developing countries]]) have been relatively accepting and supportive of globalization while the strongest opposition to globalization has come from wealthy "[[First World]]" activists, unions and NGOs. Alan Shipman, author of "The Globalization Myth" accuses the anti-globalization movement of "defusing the Western class war by shifting alienation and exploitation to developing-country sweatshops." He later goes on to claim that the anti-globalization movement has failed to attract widespread support from poor and working people from the developing nations, and that its "strongest and most uncomprehending critics had always been the workers whose liberation from employment they were trying to secure."&lt;ref&gt;Shipman, Alan "The Globalization Myth" Icon Books, 2002, p. 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

These critics assert that people from the Third World see the anti-globalization movement as a threat to their jobs, wages, consuming options and livelihoods, and that a cessation or reversal of globalization would result in many people in poor countries being left in greater poverty. [[Jesús F. Reyes Heroles]] the former Mexican Ambassador to the US, stated that "in a poor country like ours, the alternative to low-paid jobs isn't well-paid ones, it's no jobs at all."&lt;ref&gt;Johan Norberg. ''In Defense of Global Capitalism''. {{ISBN|978-1-930865-47-1}} p.194&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt's Ambassador to the UN has also stated "The question is why all of a sudden, when third world labor has proved to be competitive, why do industrial countries start feeling concerned about our workers? When all of a sudden there is a concern about the welfare of our workers, it is suspicious."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Veseth, [[Louis Uchitelle]]. ''The Rise of the Global Economy''. {{ISBN|978-1-57958-369-9}} p. 558&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there have been notable protests against certain globalization policies by workers in developing nations as in the cause of Indian farmers protesting against patenting seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/pro-ch.htm |title=Indian farmers protest against pro-liberalization agricultural policy |publisher=Twnside.org.sg |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uK2o10S7?url=http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/pro-ch.htm |archivedate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last few years, many developing countries (esp. in Latin America and Caribbean) created alter-globalization organizations as economic blocs [[Mercosur]] and [[Union of South American Nations|Unasur]], political community [[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States|CELAC]] or [[Bank of the South]] which are supporting development of low income countries without involvement from [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] or [[World Bank]].

'''Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce''' ({{lang-de|Deutscher Industrie- und Handelskammertag}}, '''DIHK''') is a [[Germany|German]] 'chamber,' similar to an [[England|English]] [[guild]] but is required under German law and provides [[Politics|political]] influence of a [[trade union]]. This organization was formerly known as the ''Deutscher Industrie- und Handelstag'' or ''DIHT''.

==DIHK==
In Germany, '[[Chambers of Commerce]] and Industry' is an organization for 79 'chambers' who represents companies within the German state.  The DIHK provides over 'three million entrepreneurs' or association members, representing small kiosks and shops to larger commercial companies, with political influence. DIHK has its headquarters in [[Berlin]], a major office in [[Brussels]] and representative offices throughout [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=DIHK1&gt;{{Cite web

Association members are under [[Chamber of Commerce#Compulsory/public law chambers|German Chamber of Commerce]] compulsory or public law model, [[Business|enterprises]] of certain sizes, types, or sectors are obliged to become members of the chamber. This model is common in [[European Union]] countries ([[France]],&lt;ref&gt;[[André-Pierre Nouvion]], ''Chambres de commerce et d'industrie'' - Encyclopédie juridique [[Dalloz]] - Répertoire de droit commercial, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]]), but also in [[Japan]]. Main tasks of the chambers are foreign trade promotion, vocational training, regional economic development, and general services to their members. The chambers were given responsibilities of public administration in various fields by the state which they exercise in order management. The chambers also have a consultative function; this means the chambers must be consulted whenever a new law related to industry or commerce is proposed.&lt;ref name=DIHK1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cipe.org/programs/training/pdf/Chamber_Primer.pdf |title=Markus Pilgrim and Ralf Meier, Chamber Primer |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107031727/http://www.cipe.org/programs/training/pdf/Chamber_Primer.pdf |archivedate=2011-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, for over 150 years, the chambers of commerce and industry (''IHK - Industrie- und Handelskammer'') and the chambers of skilled crafts (''HwK - Handwerkskammer'') are public statutory bodies with self-administration under the inspectorate of the state ministry of economy. Enterprises are members by law according to the chamber act (''IHK-Gesetz'') of 1956. Because of this, such chambers are much bigger than chambers under private law. IHK Munich, the biggest German chamber of commerce, has 350,000 member companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IHK München|url=http://www.muenchen.ihk.de|accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany also has compulsory chambers for "free occupations" such as architects, dentists, engineers, lawyers, notaries, physicians and pharmacists.  Exceptions are skilled craftsmen, [[freelancer]]s and agricultural businesses.&lt;ref name=DIHK1/&gt;&lt;ref name=OV&gt;[http://www.dihk.de/english/aboutus/overview.pdf Overview of DIHK]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{advert|date=October 2015}}'''William R. (Bill) Bartmann''' (1948 – November 29, 2016) was the founder and CEO of CFS2, Inc, a consumer financial recovery company based in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], and earlier the founder and CEO of Commercial Financial Services Inc., the nation’s biggest debt collection company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lambert|first1=Emily|title=Return of the Billionaire Huckster|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilylambert/2011/11/02/return-of-the-billionaire-huckster/|website=Forbes.com|accessdate=November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a time during its operations from 1986 to 1999. One officer of the company was involved in accounting fraud and the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cropper|first1=Carol Marie|title=Yes, Even a Bill Collector Can File for Bankruptcy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/20/business/business-yes-even-a-bill-collector-can-file-for-bankruptcy.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; though allegations of wider fraud were later determined to be untrue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Six Years Later, Trustee Clears CFS of Fraud", Collections &amp; Credit Risk Magazine, August 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Bartmann was born in [[Dubuque, Iowa]] in 1948.  At age 14, he dropped out of high school and joined a traveling carnival.  He later joined a gang called the Manor Boys.&lt;ref name="inc."&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.inc.com/magazine/19970901/1316.html | title=The Richest Man You've Never Heard Of | work=[[Inc (magazine)|Inc]] | first=Jerry | last=Useem | date=September 1, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to join the Marines but was rejected for hearing problems.  Bartmann became an alcoholic by age 17, and one night fell down a flight of stairs while drunk.  He became paralyzed and was told that he would never walk again.  Against his doctor's wishes, Bartmann embarked on a nightly regimen of physical activity until he eventually regained the use of his legs.

For several years Bartmann worked at the [[Dubuque Packing Company]], a large local slaughterhouse.  While there, Bartmann organized a [[wildcat strike]] to force the company to give benefits to part-time workers.  The strike was successful.  Around this time, Bartmann ran into a high school principal who earlier had expelled him from school.  The principal challenged Bartmann to get his GED certificate, which he did.  Bartmann later earned a BS from [[Loras College]] and a JD from [[Drake University]].

After passing the Iowa Bar Exam, Bartmann immediately went into private practice, specializing in consumer law.  He also invested in real estate.  Bartmann moved to Muskogee, OK to devote full-time to [[real estate investing]]. Bartmann was later asked by a local bank to take over a struggling oil equipment company in [[Oklahoma]]. He turned around the company and grew it substantially.  It folded in 1985 due to falling oil prices, with Bartmann one million dollars in debt due to personally guaranteeing some of the corporate obligations.&lt;ref name="inc."/&gt; Bartmann died at the age of 68 due to complications shortly after [[heart bypass surgery]] on November 29, 2016.{{Where|date=November 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Randy Krehbiel, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/tulsa-businessman-bill-bartmann-dies/article_04304efc-5175-55f4-a3c3-31f12c89b18b.html "Tulsa businessman Bill Bartmann dies"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', November 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial Financial Services ==
Hounded by debt collectors, Bartmann looked for other opportunities.  He saw an ad in the newspaper about buying defaulted loans from the federal government.  He bought a portfolio of loans, financed by the bank he was $1 million in debt to.  Bartmann succeeded in collecting enough money from that first portfolio to recoup the cost of the portfolio, plus make a partial repayment on his bank debt.  That led to more purchases of loan portfolios that allowed Bartmann to repay the entire $1 million obligation.  Bartmann created a consumer friendly company that would buy delinquent debts from banks and then attempt to restructure them according to terms the customer could afford. The strategy was successful, he was able to help 4.5 million consumers resolve $15 billion in debt, all of it without ever suing a consumer, producing net margins as high as 48%.&lt;ref name="inc."/&gt;

But CFS didn't actually make any profit on collecting debt balances but from paying 5 cents on the dollar for consumer debt accounts that had been charged-off from banks. This enabled CFS to only have to collect 10 cents on each dollar of outstanding debt and double their initial investment. But the exorbitant profits of CFS came from securitizations collateralized by charge-off consumer debt. So profitable, that for every $100 million in collateralized securitizations, CFS immediately profited by $40 million. This did nothing to correct or improve a consumer's credit profile or score.&lt;ref&gt;"CFS History", FundingUniverse&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1997, Bartmann was listed in Forbes magazine as one of the 400 richest people in America.  Inc. magazine estimated Bartmann's net worth to be in the range of $2.4 to $3.5 billion.&lt;ref name="inc."/&gt; Goldman Sachs offered to buy a 20% stake in the company and [[Norwest Bank]] offered to acquire, but Bartmann refused both offers.

As the company grew, Bartmann gained a reputation for doing the unexpected. He challenged his staff that if they beat their performance goals, he would take them all to Las Vegas.  They exceeded the target and Bartmann flew the entire company to Las Vegas.  Bartmann arrived and wrestled Hulk Hogan at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Vegas." &lt;ref name="inc."/&gt; On another occasion, Bartmann leased 27 Boeing 747 Jumbo Jets to fly thousands of employees to Disney World for the weekend. CFS offered free on-site daycare that grew to 500 children, as well as free full health care and a 250% company match in its 401(k) program. BusinessWeek magazine called CFS "One of the top 10 family-oriented businesses in America" and Working Mother Magazine named it "One of the top 100 best companies for working mothers."

In 1998 the Harvard Business School published a case study on the methods Commercial Financial Services used to securitize non-performing debt.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth A. Froot, Ivan Farman: "Commercial Financial Services, Inc.: Securitization of Charged-off Credit Card Receivables", Harvard Business School.  Publication date: October 14, 1998. Prod. #: 299023-PDF-ENG&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s Museum of American History awarded CFS its Computer World award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwhonors.org/Search/his_4a_detail.asp?id%3D3192 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729223338/http://www.cwhonors.org/Search/his_4a_detail.asp?id=3192 |archivedate=2014-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for technological innovations.

Also in 1998, an investigation began after an anonymous letter raised questions about the propriety of certain transactions at the company by a rogue employee.  Throughout the ensuing investigation, Bartmann maintained his innocence.  Jay Jones, a shareholder of the company, later confessed to the questionable transactions and admitted that Bartmann did not know about them.  Nevertheless, the U.S. Department of Justice persuaded a third grand jury to indict Bartmann and other senior executives.

In the trial that followed, Bartmann was found to be not guilty of all charges.&lt;ref&gt;"Credit company co-founder acquitted", Kelly Kurt, Associated Press, December 4, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; One of Bartmann's co-defendants sued the government for malicious prosecution and won.&lt;ref&gt;http://i.imgur.com/TaPF5.png&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the controversy meant his company could not obtain financing and Commercial Financial Services declared bankruptcy.  A bankruptcy trustee liquidated the company, laying off its 3900+ employees.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/20/business/business-yes-even-a-bill-collector-can-file-for-bankruptcy.html?pagewanted=all| title=Yes, Even a Bill Collector Can File for Bankruptcy | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=December 20, 1998 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the bankruptcy trustee for Commercial Financial Services publicly declared that the company had not engaged in fraud.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Bartmann was cleared of all wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/spending/T025-S001-millionaires-who-lost-it-all-but-came-back/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://imgur.com/mNA3H&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other activities ==
In 2002, the Governor appointed Bartmann to the board of Oklahoma Futures, a public-private partnership whose goal was to advise the governor, legislature, and judiciary on ways to promote economic development in Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bartmann Named to State Board|newspaper=Tulsa Business Journal|date=May 17, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate confirmed Bartmann's nomination.

In 2003 Bartmann founded Bill Bartmann Enterprises in order to offer business training and information to entrepreneurs.  In 2008 he noticed that the banking bailout and TARP subsidies presented an opportunity to buy defaulted debt from troubled banks, mirroring the situation he built Commercial Financial Services on in the 1980s and 1990s.  Bartmann developed a series of training programs to enable individuals to buy portfolios of defaulted credit-card debt and then taught them how to collect without using litigation or other abusive behavior.

In 2009 Bartmann published a book, "Bailout Riches", which describes the opportunity he says the bank-bailout and recession of 2008-2010 has created. The book became a #1 world-wide bestseller on Amazon, and also made it to the Wall Street Journal, USA Today and BusinessWeek bestseller lists.

In 2010 Bill Bartmann Enterprises was named to the "Inc. 500" for 2009. It's the fifth time Bartmann has made the list.&lt;ref&gt;"Meet America's Fastest-Growing Private Companies and the Superstar Entrepreneurs Who Run Them."  Inc. Magazine.  Publication date: Sept 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inc.com/magazine/20100901/how-bill-bartmann-lost-it-all-and-got-it-back.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== CFS2 ==
Bartmann re-established his former consumer financial recovery company, naming the successor entity, CFS2, in July 2010.  Later that year the company leased space at the [[CityPlex Towers]] complex in south Tulsa, returning Bartmann to the location where CFS had previously operated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/article.aspx?subjectid=51&amp;articleid=20101130_51_0_BillBa182488 "Bill Bartmann to return to CityPlex Towers"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', November 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Bartmann is in the midst of reviewing potential sites across the country for expansion, with Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio and Arkansas having offered incentives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vegasinc.com/news/2012/jan/17/southern-nevada-competing-debt-collection-company-/ "Southern Nevada competing for debt-collection company, 2,000 jobs"], ''[[VegasInc]]'', January 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Counter-intuitively CFS2 offers a unique array of free services to those they are collecting from, including: employment assistance,&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.hbr.org/hbr/hbreditors/2013/08/the_debt_collection_company_th.html&lt;/ref&gt; credit specialists who negotiate reductions of other personal debt, resume writing, medical discounts and help accessing government assistance. An anomaly to the debt collection industry, CFS2 has pledged to never litigate in order to collect from their accounts and has encouraged others in his industry to follow his lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stopthesecriminals.com |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117041547/http://www.stopthesecriminals.com/ |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This helping hand approach reduces the banks reputational risk while enabling CFS2 to collect at rates twice the industry average.

In April 2013 CFS2 became the first and only collection company to ever win The American Consumer Council's&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanconsumercouncil.org/&lt;/ref&gt; "Friend of the Consumer" award. In bestowing the award American Consumer Council CEO, Thomas Hinton, remarked "as a financial recovery company, CFS2 is offering valued services that millions of consumers desperately need as we emerge from one of the longest recessions in our nation's history."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfstwo.com/wsj.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 he won this award for the second time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.docstoc.com/docs/168339309/CFS2%20-%202014%20Friend%20of%20the%20Consumer%20Award&lt;/ref&gt; CFS2 has also won the Compass Award for Business Ethics;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.okethics.org/awards&lt;/ref&gt; the Beacon Award for Community Involvement&lt;ref&gt;http://journalrecord.com/beacon-awards/2013/07/12/guiding-the-way-beacon-event-pays-tribute-to-philanthropic-leaders/&lt;/ref&gt; the “Stevie” Award for Customer Service, and has been named as one of the most admired CEO's in Oklahoma by the Oklahoma Journal Record.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stevieawards.com/pubs/awards/403_2662_22383.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://journalrecord.com/2014/02/05/most-admired-ceos-profile-bill-bartmann-cfs2-general-news/&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013 CFS2 was featured on CBS Evening news as the debt collector who thrives using the unique strategy of kindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57606148/debt-collector-thrives-with-simple-strategy-kindness/ | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry reform efforts ==
In the 1990s Bartmann gained a reputation for collecting debts by avoiding strong-arm tactics.&lt;ref name="inc."/&gt;   
He is following the same consumer-advocate approach in his new company, CFS2.  He says: "We’re going to go at it the same way we did before, treating people with respect and helping them out of bad situations." &lt;ref name="Oklahoma Magazine"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.okmag.com/index.cfm?id=13&amp;homepageID=125 | title=The Resurrection of Bill Bartmann | work=[[Oklahoma (magazine)|Oklahoma]] | first=Michael | last=Sasser | date=February 2011 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Bartmann-run website, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110117041547/http://www.stopthesecriminals.com/ StopTheseCriminals.com], urges consumers to sign a petition that calls for drastic legislative and regulatory reforms of the debt-collection industry.  Among those recommended reforms are the barring of all collection efforts on debt that is older than the statute of limitations; allowing consumers to record telephone calls from collection agencies; and requiring the licensing of both agencies and individual collectors.

Bartmann has persuaded 200 Debt Buying companies&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bartmannpledge.com/Pledgees.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; to take the “Bartmann Pledge’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bartmannpledge.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bartmann Pledge requires all signors to agree not to use litigation against debtors; not to charge interest on the obligation, not to attempt to contact debtors more than twice in one day, not to pursue debtors beyond the statute of limitations and not to resell delinquent loans.

Bartmann has worked with members of the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate to reform the current federal debt-collection rules. In addition he helped to enact a recent change to the Oklahoma debt-collection rules, which the Governor of Oklahoma signed into law in June 2011.&lt;ref name="BondsDebt.net"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://bondsdebt.net/Debt/collection-debt-law-oklahoma/ | title=Bill Bartmann Takes Debt Collection Abuse Campaign to Minnesota InsideARM | date=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bartmann authored Oklahoma Senate bill 1430 “The Bartmann Bill” which  would require debt collectors to follow stringent practices designed to protect consumers.  This bill passed the Senate 40-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Senate passes debt buyer bill|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=336&amp;articleid=20120311_336_A21_OKLAHO126110|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130204201837/http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=336&amp;articleid=20120311_336_A21_OKLAHO126110|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-02-04|publisher=Tulsa World}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Bartmann was nominated to the Consumer Advisory Board of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) by the president of the American Bankers Association (ABA), Frank Keating. The nomination was seconded by six sitting state attorneys general.

In October 2012, Bartmann was invited to the West Wing of the White  House to meet with the Deputy Director of the National Economic Council and Senior Policy Advisers to  discuss the creation of a  moratorium on debt collection litigation that would reduce the national bankruptcy rate by as much as 50% while also reducing the national unemployment rate. Bartmann has worked extensively with Attorneys General across the United States to promote debt collection reforms and has testified as an expert witness at their request at numerous proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110518005194/en/Industry-Insider-Testifies-to%C2%A0Massachusetts-Attorney-General-Martha&lt;/ref&gt;

Bartmann is a regular contributor to publications like The Huffington Post&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-bartmann/ | work=Huffington Post | first=Bill | last=Bartmann | title=Bill Bartmann}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Christian Science Monitor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csmonitor.com/content/search?SearchText=%22Bill+Bartmann%22&amp;SearchButton=Search&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CFSII seeks new industry standard in debt collection|url=http://tulsabusiness.com/main.asp?Search=1&amp;ArticleID=54826&amp;SectionID=3&amp;SubSectionID=50&amp;S=1|publisher=TulsaBusiness.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He authored Out of Control: Cases of Debt-Collection Abuse In America And What We Can Do About It,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Out-Control-Debt-Collection-America-ebook/dp/B0053CQHMU |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502004732/http://www.amazon.com/Out-Control-Debt-Collection-America-ebook/dp/B0053CQHMU |archivedate=May 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; an expose´of the debt collection industry.

Bartmann created the non-profit organization, The Center for Consumer Recovery,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centerforconsumerrecovery.org/&lt;/ref&gt; which, in October 2013, launched the Shutdown Affected Forbearance Relief (SAFR) program to help the 400,000 federal employees furloughed by the government shutdown.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kjrh.com/dpp/news/local_news/tulsa-company-helps-furloughed-federal-workers-with-their-debts&lt;/ref&gt; The Center for Consumer Recovery contacts the creditors of these furloughed workers and persuades them to grant a forbearance of interest, principal and credit reporting until the employee is called back to work. The organization's primary charter is to assist families victimized by natural disasters and act as an advocate and intermediary by dealing with the victim’s creditors, insurers and governmental agencies.

In July 2013 Bill Bartmann was nominated for the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize for his debt collection industry reform efforts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/281180-a-debt-collector-with-heart/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://claremoreprogress.com/x881892163/Dr-Rice-nominates-Bartmann-for-2014-Nobel-Peace-Prize&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, The Governor of Oklahoma appointed Bartmann to the Council of Bond Oversight. This five-member Council is responsible for reviewing and approving all financing requests by state agencies, authorities, departments and trusts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billbartmann.com/documents/Appointment-GovernorFallin.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045324/http://www.billbartmann.com/documents/Appointment-GovernorFallin.pdf |archivedate=April 29, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Calixto R. Catáquiz''' (born December 29, 1948) is the former [[mayor]] of [[San Pedro, Laguna]], [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wowlaguna.com/?s=Calixto+R.+Cat%C3%A1quiz&amp;submit=Search|title=San Pedro, Laguna (Population, History, Gov. Officials, Barangays, Industries)|publisher=WowLaguna.com|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a [[businessman]] and [[banker]], and once managed the [[Laguna Lake Development Authority]] from 2001 to 2003.

==Early life and education==
Calixto Catáquiz was born in [[Manila]]. His parents were Rodolfo C. Catáquiz of [[Unisan, Quezon]], and Rosa T. Ramírez of [[San Pedro, Laguna]]. His parents were the pioneers of the ''[[balut (food)|balút]]'' industry in San Pedro. Calex, as his family members and friends call him, grew up in his mother's hometown. He was an only child from an affluent family.
Catáquiz had his elementary education first in San Pedro Central Elementary School (1959–1961), then he transferred to Canossa School of [[Santa Rosa, Laguna]] (1961–1965).
He spent his high school and college days in [[San Beda College]], Manila where he took up Bachelor of Science in Commerce (Management).

==After graduation==
After his studies, Catáquiz assisted his parents in their various businesses. He became the bank manager of Entrepreneur Bank (Rural Bank of Unisan) which his father had founded in the latter's hometown of [[Unisan, Quezon]]. Back in his hometown of San Pedro, he founded the Sampaguita Savings Bank at age 30, but eventually sold Sampaguita Savings Bank to a family from Muntinlupa.

==Political career==
According to Mayor Catáquiz, he never really had any intention at all to run for any public office. He was just prodded by the people of San Pedro, particularly former Mayor José L. Amante, to run against then incumbent Mayor Felicísimo Vierneza during the [[Philippine local election, 1980|30 January 1980 Philippine Elections]]. He lost during his first foray into Philippine politics.

During the [[1986 People Power Revolution]], he led San Pedro's delegation of the Justice for Aquino, Justice for All (JAJA), funding the participants with his own money (for food, transportation, and other protest rally materials). His association with the opposition brought him into a misunderstanding with none other but his parents, who were known close friends of former dictator [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]].

Due to his participation in [[EDSA I|EDSA]], the leaders of the newly installed [[president]] [[Corazon C. Aquino|Corazón C. Aquino]]'s Revolutionary Government appointed him as the Officer In Charge of San Pedro, replacing Vierneza. It was not an easy ascent into power because Mayor Vierneza, like most local chief executives at that time, refused to go down, believing that Aquino's revolutionary government was illegal. Thus, a forced takeover ensued wherein Catáquiz supporters clashed with Vierneza's men.

Mayor Catáquiz served as San Pedro's OIC from 1986 to 1988. During the 1988 Philippine elections, he was elected into office for the first time. He remained in power until 1998.

In 2001, he was seen once again in the second People Power Revolution at EDSA. Upon [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]'s appointment as President of the Philippines, Catáquiz was tasked to head the Laguna Lake Development Authority.

As LLDA General Manager, he was able to make [[Laguna de Bay]] a member of the Living Lakes of the World.

2007 saw him once again as San Pedro's mayor. He was re-elected as mayor on the 2010 elections.

In [[Pakistan]], [[Putting-out system|cottage]] or household industries hold an important position in rural set-up. Most villages are self-sufficient in the basic necessities of life. They have their own [[carpentry|carpenter]]s, cobblers, potters, craftsmen and [[cotton]] [[weaver (occupation)|weaver]]s. Many families depend on cottage industries for income.

Cottage industries have also gained immense importance in cities and towns. There is a great demand for hand-woven [carpet]s, [[Embroidery|embroidered work]], [[brass]]ware, [[Carpet|rug]]s and traditional [[bangle]]s. These are also considered important [[export]] items and are in good demand in international markets.

== Why it is important to encourage cottage and small-scale industries ==

There are meagre resources to develop large-scale industries. However, a program for developing and promoting small-scale industries both in rural and urban areas is more feasible figure 1 shows the advantages of establishing such industries.

[[File:Advantages of estabishing small scale industries.png|center|frame|alt=table|advantages of establishing small-scale cottage industries in Pakistan]]

# Cottage and small-scale industries are [[Labor intensity|labor-intensive]] and provide employment to 80% of the industrial [[labor force]]. This reduces the [[unemployment]] and offers opportunities for [[self-employment]].
# Traditionally, women are not encouraged to work outside their homes. Cottage or small-scale industries like carpet-weaving, [[Candle|candle-making]] and [[handicraft]]s can be established in houses and women can be gainfully employed. This increases the active labor force.
# These industries also meet the local demands for industrial goods, and save foreign exchange spent in imports.
# There is a demand for rugs, carpets, brassware, handicrafts and embroidered work in the International market. These goods provide 30% of the export receipts of the [[secondary sector of the economy|manufacturing sector]].
# When people are employed gainfully in villages, the [[human migration|migration]] of people from rural to urban areas will reduce. The acute problems of [[House|housing]], [[sanitation]], [[education]], [[transport]] and [[health]] will be reduced in urban areas.
# Many districts are under-developed. With the expansion of such industries, the regional [[Income gender gap|disparity in income]] can be reduced.
# These industries make effective use of local [[raw material]]s which also promotes primary industries like [[agriculture]] and [[mining]].
# Small-scale industry does not require much capital and [[high tech]]nology. I.T is suited to the traditional economic set-up.
# Cottage and small-scale industries do not use much imported material or equipment.
# The waste of large-scale industries, particularly the cotton, [[sugar]] and [[steel]] industries, can be used to make by-products.
# [[Interior design|Home Decoration]]

== Types of cottage and small-scale industries in Pakistan ==

There is a web of cottage and books industries. In almost every [[village]], there are a number of such industries depending upon the size of the village and the demand for the products. The establishment of such industry is closely related to the availability of raw material traditional skills, [[Climate|climatic]] conditions and, in several cases, the local specialization in the organized [[factory]] sector.

There is a large variety of handicrafts available in Pakistan. They are not only aesthetically pleasing items, but they also serve the needs of local people.

Some of these industries produce important export items. Recently exports of non-cotton products have faced increasing [[trade barrier]]s as [[public opinion]] in industrialized countries has expressed growing concern about [[child labour|child labor]], environmental and health standards. These concerns are being addressed now.

=== Carpets ===

In the small scale industries, the most important is the Carpet weaving and its center are located almost all over the Pakistan. It is also significant in economic terms and they make valuable contribution in exports. Cotton is the raw material required for this industry. They also employ women for the production of fine hand woven carpets and for the production of wool silk or a mixture of the two, as the carpets are of great significance which generates equal economic opportunities.It is valuable for gross domestic product of country.

=== Textiles ===

[[Textile]]s are found throughout the country with a variety of design and techniques. The most famous among them are [[Khādī|Khadar]], Susi, Khes, Chunri, Boski, Karandi, Shaal, and [[Ajrak]]. The designs are invariably brightly colored with traditional emphasis on blue and red.

=== Embroidery ===

Embroidery has developed to a fine art with distinctive regional designs and patterns.

=== Jewelry ===

[[Goldsmith|Gold]] and [[silversmith]]s are one of the largest communities of craftsmen. Much of the [[jewellery|jewelry]] made and sold in the cities is intricately fashioned and delicate.

=== Ceramics ===

[[Clay]] and [[terracotta]] pottery and utensils continue to be of great practical importance. Many of the designs of [[urn]]s, [[pitcher]]s, bowls, jugs, plates, and pots seen today are almost identical to those un covered at [[Archaeology|archaeological sites]] around the country. Distinctive glazed blue [[tile]]s are used to decorate many of the great [[mosque]]s in Pakistan.

=== Cutlery ===
[[Wazirabad]] is the city of cutlery industry in Pakistan . This industry is growing day by day and has share of 65 million US dollars in Export for 2010. High Quality Damascus Steel &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Maryon | first = Herbert | author-link = Herbert Maryon | date = 1948 | title = A Sword of the Nydam Type from Ely Fields Farm, near Ely | journal = Proceedings of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society | series = | volume = XLI | issue = | pages = 73–76 | doi = 10.5284/1034398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Maryon | first = Herbert | author-link = Herbert Maryon | date = February 1960 | title = Pattern-Welding and Damascening of Sword-Blades—Part 1: Pattern-Welding | journal = Studies in Conservation | series = | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–37 | doi = 10.2307/1505063 | jstor = 1505063 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Maryon | first = Herbert | author-link = Herbert Maryon | date = May 1960 | title = Pattern-Welding and Damascening of Sword-Blades—Part 2: The Damascene Process | journal = Studies in Conservation | series = | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 52–60 | doi = 10.2307/1504953 | jstor = 1504953 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is manufactured in this city and 95% of world needs are produced here.

=== Woodwork ===

The [[Swat Valley]] is perhaps the most famous for its intricately carved [[Architecture|architectural]] [[woodwork]] and [[furniture]], although [[Woodcarving|wood-carving]] is common throughout the northern mountains.

=== Sports goods ===

[[Sports goods]] earn about 3.7% of our total exports. The main raw material for the sports goods industry are [[leather]] and [[mulberry]] wood that are available in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], but also imported [[PVC]]. [[Football (ball)|Football]], [[hockey]] ball, [[hockey stick]]s, cricket bats and [[Racket (sports equipment)|rackets]] are mostly manufactured by hand. The skilled workers are available in [[Sialkot]] and [[Lahore]]. In the industry large and medium size factories contract work out to small-scale and cottage concerns.The local sports goods manufacturing industry is one of the major source of foreign exchange earnings of Pakistan. It is centralised in and around the city of Sialkot, where it has flourished as a cottage industry with most of its production by generations of skilled craftsmen. At the time of independence, this industry was in an infant stage with a nominal export of Rs. 0.82 million. The Government took immediate steps to develop this industry by providing loans and subsidies to the manufacturers and arrangements were made to market the manufactured goods. Since then, the industry has flourished locally and enjoys good reputation in the international markets as well.mostly these goods are provided to fatima syed productions

Production
At present, there are more than 2000 units, mostly on small scale in operation with an installed capacity of Rs. 20 billion per annum. The units are operating on single-shift basis.

Pakistan produces a wide range of sports goods, accessories, games and athletic equipment generally following the British, American and German specifications.

The Government is also enforcing on a compulsory basis, minimum quality standards for sports goods manufacture. The Pakistan Standards Institute, a government agency, has devised specific standards for different types of sports goods. The important items being produced are tennis rackets, hockey sticks, hokey balls, polo sticks, cricket bats and balls, footballs, (complete) and numerous goods used in both in-door as well out-door games.

At present, Pakistan's sports goods enjoy a world-wide recognition mainly because of the care that goes into their designing, manufacturing and selecting of the finest raw materials. The basic raw materials required for the production of sports goods, are leather, wood, glue, nylon guts, rubber and chemicals. Out of these, leather and various kinds of wood are abundantly available in Pakistan. The industry annually utilises materials worth Rs. 8 billion including imported raw material.

Exports
This industry is one of the major foreign exchange earners for Pakistan and is, therefore, receiving full government backing in its development. It is estimated that more than 75 per cent of the total production is exported every year.

In fact, the export demand has acted as the main stimulus for the rapid growth of this industry because of care that goes into designing, manufacturing and selecting of raw materials. There are two factors which are responsible of this.

(i) Low price as compared to general price level

(ii) Durability plus good workmanship

Export of sports goods increased from $136 million in 1990-91 to $384 million in 1997-98. Showing an average increase of 23 per cent annum as evident from table-1. The export market for sports goods is fairly diversified. More and more countries are being added to the list of their imports. In 1990-91 there were in all 50 countries importing these good from Pakistan. Thereafter, the list has continuously expanded so that during the 1992-98 period, Pakistan exported sports goods to 90 countries. However, the principal importing countries are Germany, USA, UK, France and Italy. Others were Spain, Netherlands, Hong Kong, Denmark, Canada, Belgium, Dubai and Chile. Country-wise export of sports goods is given in table-2.

In the international market, India, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea are the main competitors of Pakistan. They are supplying their products at lower prices. While India has an advantage of cheap labour and raw material Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea have semi-automotive and mechanised units and are always engaged in introducing cheap sports goods such as metal rackets and cricket bats etc.

In order to encourage the export of sports goods, the Government has taken many positive steps and has offered various incentives. Customs duty, sales tax and excise duty rebates on f.o.b. value of exported various types of sports goods are available.

Another incentive is that import of restricted and tanned raw materials are also allowed on cash licenses against export of sports goods.

This industry is facing severe competition from Taiwan, India and South Korea. Although the Government has provided various incentives and facilities to modernise and mechanise the industry, the opportunity has not been availed. The improvement in quality and consequently in exports earnings has been due to the improved availability for leather for manufacture of footballs which constitutes about 75 per cent of the total exports. Keeping in view the trends during 1991-98 about 23 per cent growth rate, improved quality available and competition faced in the international markets the future demand is expected to growth the rate of 15 per cent during 1999-2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jang.com.pk/thenews/investors/aug99/if.htm Chaudhary Arslan Gujar Advocate]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Large scale Surgical instruments ===

Sialkot and Lahore are also noted for the manufacture and export of [[surgical instrument]]s. The most important raw material is [[stainless steel]] which has to be imported. In this industry, also, medium scale factories contract work out to small-scale and cottage concerns. Also like the sports goods industry, most of the output is exported.Sialkot is the biggest surgical maker in the world and India, America, Australia and many other countries are importers of surgical instruments from this city. Sialkot has the major role in making surgical instruments

=== Other small-scale industries ===

Other small-scale industries include [[electric fan]]s, [[cutlery]] and general [[engineering]].

″small scale industries are those which generally employed less than workers and they run with or without electric powers, in or outside the home but there assets do not exceed rs.2 million.for example; carpet industry, poultry forming, hand and power loom industry, manufacturing of sports and leather goods, toy industry, agriculture implements etc.″

== Problem of cottage and small-scale industries ==

Cottage and small-scale industries contribution to the [[GDP]] is only 5%. There are certain problems associated with these industries that are mentioned below.

* [[Profit (accounting)|Profits]] are limited and they are mostly spent on the daily expenses of the owners. They do not have extra capital for expansion of these industrial units.
* Economies of scale are not available so [[Production costs|production cost]] is higher. Goods produced in small-scale industries cannot compete in open market if the same goods are manufactured on a large scale.
* The [[wholesaler]], who takes most of the profits, exploits the owners of the small-scale industry. In some cases goods are sold to wholesalers at cost price, which discourages the owners and they reduce the quality and quantity the produced.
* In rural areas, where the [[electricity]] is not provided, small-scale industries are difficult to set up. Even the great fluctuation in voltage and power break-downs cause damage to the [[electric motor]]s. The commercial rates of electricity have also increased significantly which hinders the growth.
* The craftsman and [[artisan]]s learns their skills and production methods from their elders. The provision of technical advice and further training is limited.

== Government policy towards Small-scale and cottage industries ==

The government is fully aware of the potential of cottage and small-scale industries for industrial development. The following organizations have been established to develop this sector of economy.

* Pakistan Small Industries Corporation (PSIC)
* Punjab Small Industries Corporation (PSIC)
* Sindh Small Industries Corporation (SSIC)
* The Small Industries Development Board NWFP (SIDB)
* The Directorate of Small Industries Baluchistan (DSIB)

The above organizations are taking the following measures:

* Establishment of industrial estates.
* Providing [[marketing]] facilities.
* Setting up of technical service centers.
* Establishing handicraft development centers and carpet centers.
* Providing per-investment counseling and guidance to newcomers.
* Providing local and foreign [[loan]]s to small industry owners on easy installments.

'''De Cecco''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] company producing dried pasta, flour and other related food products.

==History==
The company was founded in 1886 by the De Cecco brothers in the small town of [[Fara San Martino]] in the [[Abruzzo]] region of central [[Italy]]. Nicola De Cecco originally produced flour at his stone mill before establishing the pasta factory.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Augusta Consorti |author2=Luciano D'Amico |author3=Massimo Sargiacomo |title=Accounting and Food: Some Italian Experiences|publisher=Routledge, 2016|isbn=131722843X|pages=42-68|chapter=Accounting and Management in the Pasta Industry. The De Cecco Case (1886–1955)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1908, the company adopted a country girl with a wheat stacks as its trademark. After World War II the factory was rebuilt after being destroyed by German bomb attacks. In 1950  De Cecco completed a new factory in [[Pescara]] to meet the increased demand that occurred after the war. In 1980, a new production facility was opened in [[Fara San Martino]], doubling the company's production output. In 1986  the company began to diversify its offerings by establishing its olive oil brand. De Cecco offerings have since expanded to sauces, grains and tomato based products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paola Pierucci|title=L'impresa familiare nel Mezzogiorno continentale fra passato e presente.

Il caso della De Cecco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, De Cecco is the third largest pasta producer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrea Guccione|title=Consuma meridionale: Un manifesto per il sud|publisher=Imprimatur, 2013|isbn=886830113X|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=ljVQAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT72&amp;dq=1886++%22de+cecco%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje6tzstorQAhUlI8AKHUL-AckQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=1886%20%20%22de%20cecco%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1615">The '''European Fair Trade Association''' is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] association established informally in 1987. It gained formal status in 1990. It regroups 11 [[fair trade]] importers in 9 European countries: [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. EFTA members include [[Ctm altromercato]], [[Gepa3 Fair Handelshaus]] and [[Traidcraft]]. EFTA's aim is to support its member organizations in their work and encourage cooperation and coordination.

[[Fair trade]] importing organizations buy food and [[handicrafts]] from disadvantaged producers in [[developing countries]] and aim at improving market access and strengthening producer organizations. EFTA members generally follow [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]] (FLO) Standards, to which additional standards may be added with the aim of providing special support to particular target groups (women, ethnic minorities, politically persecuted, etc.). In [[Europe]], they sell their products through [[Worldshops]], local groups, wholesalers and mail order catalogues. [[Fair trade]] importing organizations also play an important role in awareness raising and in educating consumers and public authorities on [[fair trade]] and [[trade justice]] issues.

He has numerous international Patents in diverse areas of engineering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patents.justia.com/inventor/farad-azima|title=Farad Azima Inventions, Patents and Patent Applications - Justia Patents Search|website=''justia.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Early life and business==

In 1977 he founded the British audio manufacturer, Mission Electronics in [[Cambridge]]. This was followed by other well-known startups, notably Cyrus Electronics and later, NXT plc together with [[Gordon Brunton|Sir Gordon Brunton]].  The Company licensed patented technologies to multinationals in consumer electronics.  Cyrus Electronics manufactures specialist equipment with a serious following among the audiophile community.

In 1997, together with [[Daily Mail]] newspapers, Verity Group Plc., of which Farad was the CEO, founded Eastern Counties Radio.  During this period he also co-produced a series of [[Baroque Music]] CDs with the [[Gramophone Magazine]].  Azima has also served on the Industrial Advisory Board of [[Churchill College]], [[Cambridge University]] from 2001 to 2005.

More recently, Farad has devoted time to philanthropy and, together with his two children; Artemis and Cyrus has founded a UK registered charity, The Azima Foundation of which [[Lady Henrietta Spencer-Churchill]] is the President. The Foundation supports good causes in medicine and culture. The Foundation is also a supporter of [[Kerry Kennedy|Robert F Kennedy Center for Justice &amp; Human Rights]].

==Other interests==
Azima's wide cultural interests include the [[Menuhin International Violin Competition]], of which he is a director.  Azima also is a member of the 2010 Art &amp; Illustration Fundraising Committee of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]].  In 2010 he was appointed an honorary member of [[Asia House]] in London.  He is a Fellow of The [[Royal Institution]] of Great Britain.

Azima's recent interests have been in [[bio-medical]] and the [[clean energy]] sectors. In 2004 he&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Clean Diesel Technologies Announces Agreement with Mr Farad Azima for Business Development |url=http://investor.cdti.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=273865 |date=10 June 2004 |accessdate=27 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was invited to restructure Clean Diesel Technologies, Inc. of [[Stamford, Connecticut]].

Since 2008 Farad's principal business focus has been in the [[bio-medical]] and [[clean energy]] technologies, founding the NetScientific Group where he was Chief executive until January 2015, with [[Richard Sykes (biochemist)|Sir Richard Sykes]] as the chairman.  The Group supports industry-driven research projects at leading universities in Britain and the United States.

[[File:4243 - Venezia - Palazzo ducale - Capitello 28 - In fidelitate nullli gero - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 30-Jul-2008.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Doge's Palace, Venice|Palazzo Ducale in Venice]]: [[:commons:Category:Capitals in the Doge's Palace (Venice) - 28|capital # 28]] in the porch, featuring Virtues and vices - '''In fidelitate nulli gero''' (Fidelity)]]

'''Fidelity''' is the quality of [[faithfulness]] or [[loyalty]]. Its original meaning regarded [[duty]] in a broader sense than the related concept of ''[[fealty]]''. Both derive from the [[Latin]] word ''fidēlis'', meaning "faithful or loyal". In the [[City of London]] financial markets it has traditionally been used in the sense encompassed in the motto "My word is my bond".

==&lt;span id="lofi"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Audio and electronics==
{{redirect|Low fidelity|the aesthetic|Lo-fi music}}
{{see also|Sound recording and reproduction}}
In audio, "fidelity" denotes how accurately a copy reproduces its source. For example, a worn [[gramophone record]] will have a lower fidelity than one in good condition, and a recording made by a low budget record company in the early 20th century is likely to have significantly less audio fidelity than a good modern recording. In the 1950s, the terms "[[high fidelity]]" or "hi-fi" were popularized for equipment and recordings which exhibited more accurate [[sound reproduction]]. Similarly in [[electronics]], fidelity refers to the correspondence of the output signal to the input signal, rather than sound quality, as in the popular internet connection technology "[[Wi-Fi]]".

==&lt;span id="scimodsim"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Scientific modelling and simulation==
In the fields of [[scientific modelling]] and [[simulation]], fidelity refers to the degree to which a model or simulation reproduces the state and behaviour of a real world object, feature or condition.  Fidelity is therefore a measure of the realism of a model or simulation.&lt;ref name=SISO/&gt;  Simulation fidelity has also been described in the past as "degree of similarity".&lt;ref name=HaysSinger/&gt; In quantum mechanics and optics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowman|first=D.|last2=Harte|first2=T. L.|last3=Chardonnet|first3=V.|last4=Groot|first4=C. De|last5=Denny|first5=S. J.|last6=Goc|first6=G.

==Program evaluation==
In the field of [[program evaluation]], the term fidelity denotes how closely a set of procedures were implemented as they were supposed to have been. For example, it is difficult to draw conclusions from a study about formative assessment in school classrooms if the teachers are not able or willing to follow the procedures they received in training.&lt;ref name=ODonnell/&gt;

'''Fonseca Guimaraens''', often simply called '''Fonseca''', is one of the largest [[Port wine]] houses in [[Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intowine.com/port2.html&lt;/ref&gt; Manoel Pedro Gonçalves Guimaraens and his brother João Gonçalves Salgueiro, established the company in 1822 when they acquired control of the Fonseca and Monteiro Company from the Fonseca Family by purchase of the majority of Fonseca owned shares. A condition of the sale of Fonseca's shares was that the name Fonseca remain as the brand name.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cellartours.com/portugal/portuguese-wineries/fonseca-guimaraens-port-winery.html&lt;/ref&gt;  David Guimaraens, the great-great-great grandson of the founder Manuel Pedro, has been the head winemaker since 1994, and oversees the winemaking and blending for all four [[Taylor Fladgate]] Port houses: Taylor Fladgate, Fonseca Guimaraens, [[Croft (port)|Croft]], and [[Delaforce]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fortheloveofport.com/articles/a_Tour2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  

Fonseca maintains an [[estate (land)|estate]], [[Quinta do Panascal]], open to the public for tastings and tours. The [[vineyard Quinta]] do Panascal in the [[Douro (wine)|Douro]] has been classified as a [[Grade A producer of grapes]].&lt;ref&gt;http://quintadopanascalvisitorscentre.wordpress.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt; Fonseca currently ships a variety of Ports, including [[vintage]], 10, 20 and 40-year traditional tawnies, a 10-year white tawny, late bottle vintage, non-classic vintages (Quinta do Panascal, Guimaraens Vintage), among others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fonseca.pt/&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often confused with the similarly named, but completely unrelated, [[Portuguese wine]] producer [[José Maria da Fonseca]], based in the [[Arrábida IPR]] on the [[Setúbal peninsula]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 277"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition pg 277 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:PeterI-de Sa.jpg|left|thumb|Fonseca's modern founder Manoel Pedro Guimaraens was a supporter of King Pedro IV's ''(pictured)'' liberal reforms, which led to his having to flee Portugal to England hidden away in an empty Port wine barrel.]]
Fonseca was originally a very small Port shipper operating under the name of Fonseca, Monteiro &amp; Co. in the early 19th century. In 1822, Portugueses business man Manuel Pedro Guimaraens and his brother João Gonçalves Salgueiro, acquired operating control of the business and renamed it to Fonseca Guimaraens.&lt;ref name="Sotheby pg 338"&gt;T. Stevenson ''"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia"'' pg 338 Dorling Kindersley 2005 {{ISBN|0-7566-1324-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Liberal Wars]] of 1828-34, Guimaraens brothers was a supporters of the liberal reforms of King [[Pedro IV of Portugal]]. When the absolutist party of Portugal put Pedro's brother [[Miguel of Portugal|Miguel]] on the throne, Guimaraens found himself in danger due to his liberal support. He fled [[Portugal]], hidden in an empty Port [[wine barrel]] and later settled in [[England]] where the Fonseca company was headquartered until 1927.&lt;ref&gt;The Port Wine ''[http://www.theportwine.com/produtores/detalhes.php?id=39&amp;lang=en Fonseca]'' Producer Index, Accessed: Jan 9th, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fonseca ''"[http://www.fonseca.pt/foundation.asp Foundation]"'' Accessed: Jan 9th, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Guimaraens and his family greatly expanded Fonseca's commercial interest in the Port wine industry as well as its vineyard holdings in the Douro. In 1948, the large Port wine corporation of Taylor, Fladgate and Yeatman purchased the house but allowed Fonseca to remain its own separate entity.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 277"/&gt; The Guimaraens family has been intimately involved in the winemaking production with nearly every single vintage label Port from 1896 being made by [[Frank Guimaraens]], his great nephew [[Bruce Duncan Guimaraens|Bruce Guimaraens]] and now Bruce's son [[David Guimaraens]]. One notable exception is the 1955 vintage which was made by Frank's daughter Dorothy after her father died and before Bruce was ready.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 277"/&gt;

==Quintas==
Fonseca currently owns 3 main quinta vineyards in the Douro. Between them, they own more than 170 acres (69 hectares) which they use to make the majority of vintage Port production.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 277"/&gt;
*Cruzeiro located in the [[Val de Mendiz]] above [[Pinhão, Sergipe|Pinhão]]
*Santo António also located in the Val de Mendiz
*Quinta do Panascal located on the southern banks of the Douro. Acquired in 1978.

==Wines==
[[File:Taylor's 3.JPG|right|thumb|Today Fonseca is part of the Taylor Fladgate family of Port shippers]]
The first Fonseca vintage Port was shipped to England in 1847.&lt;ref name="Hersh"&gt;R. Hersh ''"[http://www.fortheloveofport.com/profiles-in-port/fonseca Fonseca]"'' For the Love of Port, February 9th 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Today Fonseca produces a wide variety of Port styles with their aged tawnies, vintage Ports and "super ruby" brand Bin 27 being the best known internationally.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 277"/&gt; While Fonseca wines are found throughout the globe, the [[United States]] is the single largest market for Fonseca's vintage Port-with more of this wine being exported to the US than to any other market.&lt;ref name="Hersh"/&gt; Most of these wines are simply labeled as "Fonseca" with a [[second wine]] series of Fonseca Guimaraens also being produced.&lt;ref name="Sotheby pg 338"/&gt;

==Asia Initiatives==
[[File:AI Logo Final.jpg|alt=www.asiainitiatives.org|thumb|Asia Initiatives: Empowering Women by Social Capital]]
Inspired by [[M. S. Swaminathan|Professor M.S. Swaminathan]], a world renowned scientist and humanist, Geeta and Krishen Mehta co-founded Asia Initiatives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asiainitiatives.org/|title=Asia Initiatives|website=www.asiainitiatives.org|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999 in [[Tokyo]]. Since 2010 it has been registered as a 501 (c)(3) [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] in [[New York City|New York]]. It has funded [[microcredit]] banks and sent computers to Village Information Center projects in [[South India]] with [[MS Swaminathan Research Foundation]]. Asia Initiatives has also supported projects in education and healthcare in underserved areas with non-profit organizations like the [[Self-Employed Women's Association]] in Delhi and Ahmedabad, the [http://www.cfdngo.org Center for Development] in Ahmedabad, [http://www.saveindianfarmers.org Save Indian Farmers] and [http://www.parmarthindia.com Parmarth Samaj Sevi Sansthan] in Maharashtra, the [http://sesindia.org Shohratgarh Environmental Society] in UP,  [http://friendsofdoon.org/fods/ Friends of the Doon Society] in Dehradoon, Ashta No Kai&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/ashtanokai/home|title=Ashta No Kai|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Pune]], Arpana Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arpana.org/|title=Arpana Home|website=www.arpana.org|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Delhi]], Women Lead&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://women-lead.org/|title=Women LEAD Nepal|website=Women LEAD Nepal|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Nepal]], Saving Mothers in [[Bangladesh]], and Philippine Christian Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.p-c-f.org/|title=PCF - Purple Community Fund|website=www.p-c-f.org|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Manila]].

Asia Initiatives has also provided consulting services for SoCCs to [https://www.womenstrong.org WomenStrong International] for projects in Kumasi (Ghana), Kisumu (Kenya) and Washington DC.

The M.S. Swaminathan Award was presented at the Asia Initiatives Gala to the noted economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]] (2014), [[Indra Nooyi]] for steering [[PepsiCo]] towards Performance with Purpose (2015) and [[Kerry Kennedy]] for her work on human rights (2016).

In honor of The 8th Secretary General of the United Nations, Asia Initiatives has instituted the Ban Ki-moon Award for Women’s Empowerment. The award was presented by SG Ban at the Asia Initiatives 2017 Gala to Gloria Steinem, Yue Sai Kan and Eva Haller&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.empowerwomen.org/en/community/stories/2017/11/8th-un-former-secretary-general-ban-ki-moon-celebrates-leaders-of-the-womens-movement|title=Empower Women - 8th UN Former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Celebrates Leaders of the Women’s Movement|work=EmpowerWomen|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it will be presented to [[Chelsea Clinton]] at the 2018 Gala.

==SoCCs (Social Capital Credits)==
Learning from projects supported by Asia Initiatives,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asiainitiatives.org/|title=Asia Initiatives|website=www.asiainitiatives.org|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geeta Mehta developed the concept of Social Capital Credits (SoCCs), a community currency for social good.  AI establishes systems for communities and individuals to earn SoCCs when they accomplish actions for the common good.  These SoCCs are then redeemable for services or items such as [[Health care|healthcare]], [[education]], and skill empowerment, that are needed to help communities climb out of [[poverty]].  iSoCCs are SoCCs points earned by individuals through one's performance of social goods, in which they can redeem for necessary goods and services.  CommSoCCs are SoCCs points that are attributed to the community as a whole. Every five iSoCCs are automatically converted to one CommSoCCs. The purpose of CommSoCCs is to help bring communities together by working on joint projects. 

The SoCCs team at Asia Initiatives works with communities extensively to customize SoCCs menus to their specific needs and capabilities. SoCCs Earning Menus include items such as getting children [[Vaccination|vaccinated]], sending children (especially daughters) to [[Secondary school|high school]], [[waste management]], providing [[Child care|childcare]] or [[Elderly care|senior care]], planting trees, and paving streets. iSoCCs Redemption Menus include items such as school fees, skill training classes, home repairs and telephone talk time. CommSoCCs can then be used for common projects such as a micro-[[sewage]] system, improvements to streets or public spaces, or child-care centers. A local SoCC Manager is trained to work with the community.  Asia Initiatives also has an online platform, www.SoCCmarket.org,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soccmarket.org/|title=SoCCs|website=www.soccmarket.org|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; for trading SoCCs and capturing necessary data. SoCCs are currently being used in pilot sites in [[Costa Rica]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[India]], and [[United States]]. with local partners that range from corporations to municipal governments.  Geeta Mehta has been featured in articles in [[Forbes]]&lt;ref&gt;Restauri, Denise. "What's Better Than Money? One Woman's Powerful Answer To That Question." Forbes. Forbes Magazine, 27 Sept. 2015. Web. 08 Apr. 2016. &lt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/deniserestauri/2015/09/27/whats-better-than-money-one-womans-powerful-answer-to-that-question/#308340cd3ffa&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ Huffington Post]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-m-blaustein/an-ingenious-tool-for-empowering-women_b_9791740.html|title=An Ingenious Tool for Empowering Women and Girls: Social Capital Credits|last=Blaustein|first=Susan M.|date=2016-04-28|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describe the creation and use of SoCCs in greater detail.

Asia Initiatives was among the six winners of the Amravati [http://happycitiessummit.org Happy Cities] competition in April 2018, and has signed an MoU with the government of Andhra Pradesh to implement SoCCs in this new city that is being designed by Sir [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] and Hafeez Contractor.

Asia Initiatives is also partnering with [https://savelifefoundation.org SaveLIFE] Foundation on implementing SoCCs on the Mumbai Pune Expressway to reduce the number of accidents and to incentivize good driving.

==URBZ==
With [[urban planner]] Matias Echanove and [[Urban Anthropology and Studies of Cultural Systems and World Economic Development|urban anthropologist]] Rahul Srivastava, Geeta is the co-founding partner of [http://www.urbz.org URBZ]: User Generated Cities, a think/action tank that focuses on participatory urban planning and design systems. It has conducted research  and held workshops for urban-visioning for communities in [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Turkey]] and [[Brazil]]. The work of URBZ was included in the exhibition “[http://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2013/11/06/uneven-growth-tactical-urbanisms-for-expanding-megacities Uneven Growth]” at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]] from November 2014~May 2015.  URBZ was also named one of the 100 most influential names in architecture in the world by the magazine Il Giornale dell'Architettura&lt;ref&gt;"100 (quelli Che Contano 2011) | Esprit Architettura Architetti Associati."

{{nihongo|'''Genichi Taguchi'''|田口 玄一|Taguchi Gen'ichi}} (January 1, 1924 – June 2, 2012) was an [[engineer]] and [[statistician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiusa.com/thought-leadership/news-and-events/167-death-of-dr-taguchi |title=ASI Mourns the Loss of Dr. Genichi Taguchi |publisher=Asiusa.com |date=2012-03-28 |accessdate=2012-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019015145/http://www.asiusa.com/thought-leadership/news-and-events/167-death-of-dr-taguchi |archivedate=2012-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1950s onwards, Taguchi developed a methodology for applying [[statistics]] to improve the quality of manufactured goods. [[Taguchi methods]] have been controversial among some conventional Western statisticians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wadsworth |first=Harrison M. |title=Handbook of statistical methods for engineers and scientists |edition=2nd |year=1997 |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Gerald F. |title=Quality problem solving |year=1998 |publisher=American Society for Quality |pages=250?251}}&lt;/ref&gt; but others have accepted many of the concepts introduced by him as valid extensions to the body of knowledge.

==Biography==

Taguchi was born and raised in the textile town of [[Tokamachi, Niigata|Tokamachi]], in [[Niigata prefecture]]. He initially studied textile [[engineering]] at [[Gunma University|Kiryu Technical College]] with the intention of entering the family [[kimono]] business.&lt;ref name="asqbio"&gt;{{cite web |title=Genichi Taguchi |url=http://www.asq.org/about-asq/who-we-are/bio_taguchi.html |publisher=American Society for Quality}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the escalation of [[World War II]] in 1942, he was drafted into the Astronomical Department of the Navigation Institute of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].

After the war, in 1948 he joined the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Public Health and Welfare]], where he came under the influence of eminent [[statistician]] [[Matosaburo Masuyama]], who kindled his interest in the [[design of experiments]]. He also worked at the [[Institute of Statistical Mathematics]] during this time,&lt;ref name="asqbio" /&gt; and supported experimental work on the production of [[penicillin]] at [[Morinaga Pharmaceuticals]], a [[Morinaga &amp; Company|Morinaga Seika]] company.

In 1950, he joined the Electrical Communications Laboratory (ECL) of the [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone]] Corporation just as statistical quality control was beginning to become popular in [[Japan]],&lt;ref name="asqbio" /&gt; under the influence of [[W. Edwards Deming]] and the [[Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers]]. ECL was engaged in a rivalry with [[Bell Labs]] to develop cross bar and telephone switching systems, and Taguchi spent his twelve years there in developing methods for enhancing quality and reliability. Even at this point, he was beginning to consult widely in Japanese industry, with [[Toyota]] being an early adopter of his ideas.

During the 1950s, he collaborated widely and in 1954-1955 was visiting professor at the [[Indian Statistical Institute]], where he worked with [[C. R. Rao]],  [[Ronald Fisher]] and [[Walter A. Shewhart]].&lt;ref name="jayaswal"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jayaswal |first=Bijay K. |author2=Peter C. Patton |title=Design for Trustworthy Software: Tools, Techniques, and Methodology of Developing Robust Software |year=2006 |publisher=Prentice Hall |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working at the SQC Unit of ISI, he was introduced to the [[orthogonal array testing|orthogonal arrays]] invented by C. R. Rao - a topic which was to be instrumental in enabling him to develop the foundation blocks of what is now known as Taguchi methods.

On completing his doctorate at [[Kyushu University]] in 1962,&lt;ref name="ieee95"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Taguchi |first=Genichi |title=Quality engineering (Taguchi methods) for the development of electronic circuit technology |journal=IEEE Transactions on Reliability |publisher=IEEE Reliability Society |volume=44 |issue=2 |date=June 1995 |pages=225?229 |issn=0018-9529 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=387375&amp;isnumber=8781 |doi=10.1109/24.387375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies on mathematical statistics for quality control|author=Gen'ichi TAGUCHI|publisher=Kushu University|date=March 1962|series=Doctoral thesis|url=http://iss.ndl.go.jp/books/R100000002-I000007814567-00}}&lt;/ref&gt; he left ECL, though he maintained a consulting relationship. In the same year he visited [[Princeton University]] under the sponsorship of [[John Tukey]], who arranged a spell at [[Bell Labs]], his old ECL rivals. In 1964 he became professor of [[engineering]] at [[Aoyama Gakuin University]], [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name="jayaswal" /&gt; In 1966 he began a collaboration with [[Yuin Wu]], who later emigrated to the [[United States|U.S.]] and, in 1980, invited Taguchi to lecture. During his visit there, Taguchi himself financed a return to [[Bell Labs]], where his initial teaching had made little enduring impact. This second visit began a collaboration with [[Madhav Phadke]] and a growing enthusiasm for his methodology in [[Bell Labs]] and elsewhere, including [[Ford Motor Company]], [[Boeing]], [[Xerox]] and [[ITT Corporation|ITT]].

Since 1982, Genichi Taguchi has been an advisor to the [[Japanese Standards Institute]] and executive director of the American Supplier Institute, an international consulting organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About ASI |url=http://www.amsup.com/about.htm |publisher=American Supplier Institute |accessdate=2009-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402001648/http://www.amsup.com/about.htm |archivedate=2009-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His concepts pertaining to experimental design, the loss function, robust design, and the reduction of variation have influenced fields beyond product design and manufacturing, such as [[sales process engineering]].&lt;ref name="Selden 1997"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sales Process Engineering: A Personal Workshop |last=Selden |first=Paul H. |publisher=ASQ Quality Press |location = Milwaukee, WI| year=1997 |pages=156?158, 169, 237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==

{{main|Taguchi methods}}

Taguchi has made a very influential contribution to industrial statistics. Key elements of his quality philosophy include the following:
#[[Taguchi loss function]], used to measure financial loss to society resulting from poor quality;
#The philosophy of ''off-line quality control'', designing products and processes so that they are insensitive ("robust") to parameters outside the design engineer's control.
#Innovations in the statistical [[design of experiments]], notably the use of an outer array for factors that are uncontrollable in real life, but are systematically varied in the experiment.

'''Herman August Kähler''', usually known as '''Herman A. Kähler''', (6 March 1846 – 16 November 1917) was a Danish ceramic designer and manufacturer who ran the Kähler ceramic factory (''[[Kählers Keramiske Værksted]]'') in [[Næstved]], Denmark.&lt;ref name="Campbell2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Gordon|title=Kähler, Herman August: The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i3Od9bcGus0C&amp;pg=PA464|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518948-3|page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Kähler was the son of Joachim Christian Herman Kähler (1808-1884) from the [[Duchy of Holstein]] who established a pottery workshop in Næstved in 1839. Herman attended the Technical School in Copenhagen (1864–65) while studying privately under [[Herman Wilhelm Bissen]]. Thereafter he travelled to Germany, Switzerland and Paris, returning to Næstved at the end of 1867.&lt;ref name=dbl/&gt;

==Career==

[[File:Kahler - Four-handled vase with crackle glaze.jpg|thumb|120px|Four-handled Kähler vase with crackle glaze (1900)]]
Together with his younger brother Carl Frederik Kähler, he took over the running of the factory in 1872.&lt;ref name=ceramicstoday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceramicstoday.com/articles/danish_ceramics7.htm|title=Danish Ceramics VII - The Turn of the Century|author=Tove Jespersen|publisher=Ceramics Today|accessdate=25 October 2014 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl became responsible for producing faiance while Herman specialized in manufacturing tiled stoves. In 1875, after Carl withdrew, Herman built a new factory on the town's outskirts where he produced both stoves and pottery.&lt;ref name=dbl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/index.php?title=Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Handel_og_industri/Fabrikant/Herman_A._K%C3%A4hler|title=Herman A. Kähler|publisher=''Dansk Biografisk Leksikon''|accessdate=25 October 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of his collaboration with the artist [[Vilhelm Klein]], Kähler became interested in obtaining the red lustre glaze known as [[maiolica]] which had been produced in [[Gubbio]], Italy, in the 16th century. In 1888 he succeeded, developing the now famous ruby glaze known as Kähler red.&lt;ref name=ceramicstoday/&gt; The designer [[Karl Hansen Reistrup]] (1863–1929) soon joined the enterprise, assisting in the production of finely formed, artistically decorated items, especially vases.&lt;ref name=dbl/&gt; Thanks to Reistrup's designs, Kähler's ceramics achieved considerable success both at the [[Nordic Exhibition of 1888|Great Nordic Exhibition]] held in Copenhagen in 1888 and at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]] held the following year in Paris.&lt;ref name="Campbell2006"/&gt; A number of other artists began to design items for the Kähler factory, including [[Thorvald Bindesbøll]], [[H. A. Brendekilde]], [[L.A. Ring]] and [[Svend Hammershøi]]. Their contributions further enhanced the firm's international success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/index.php?title=Kunst_og_kultur/Kunsth%C3%A5ndv%C3%A6rk_og_design/Kunsth%C3%A5ndv%C3%A6rk_i_Danmark_efter_1850/Herman_August_K%C3%A4hler|title=Herman A. Kähler|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=25 October 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kähler died in Næstved in 1917. His son Herman Hans Christian Kähler (1876-1940) who had taken over management of the factory in 1901 continued to run the enterprise.&lt;ref name=ceramicstoday/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Injaz-updated map.pdf|left|thumb|INJAZ Al-Arab's Region Map]]
INJAZ Al-Arab began its work in the Middle East &amp; North Africa ([[MENA]]) region in 1999 and joining [[Junior Achievement]], established its regional office in 2004. Since joining JA, and under INJAZ Al-Arab's founder and former CEO Soraya Salti's leadership, INJAZ grew in program availability, student participation, and reach. Today, it operates in 14 countries as a federation of national operations. INJAZ Al-Arab's network includes Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.injaz-qatar.org/|title=INJAZ Qatar|website=www.injaz-qatar.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.

== Activities ==
INJAZ Al-Arab's programs focus on three core areas of business education which are:

*'''Work Readiness''': The widespread mismatch between the skills attained in school and those demanded by the private sector are feeding current youth unemployment rates. INJAZ Al-Arab programs build teamwork, critical thinking, problem solving, communication, and leadership skills employers look for. 
*'''Financial Literacy''': Teaching young people about responsible money management is key to building their own financial security and an economically prosperous future for themselves.
*'''Entrepreneurship''': Entrepreneurship education prepares youth to be responsible, enterprising individuals. Immersing them in real life learning experiences allows them to take measured risks, manage the results, and learn from the outcomes. This growing number of youth led enterprises creates new jobs and fuels economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jaworldwide.org/ja-works/Pages/JAs-Core-Content.aspx|title=JA's Core Content|website=JA Worldwide|access-date=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Allan Coutts''' {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|size=100%|CM}} (May 16, 1938 – December 31, 2013) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[lawyer]], [[businessman]], and former advisor to two [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]]s.

==Biography==
Born in [[High River]], [[Alberta]], he was raised in [[Nanton, Alberta]]. He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1960 and a law degree in 1961 from the [[University of Alberta]] and an [[MBA]] from the [[Harvard Business School]] in 1968. He was called to Bar of Alberta in 1962.

From 1961 to 1963, he practiced law in [[Calgary, Alberta]]. From 1963 to 1966, he was a Secretary to [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Lester B. Pearson]]. After receiving his MBA, he was a Consultant with [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] from 1968 to 1970. From 1970 to 1975, he was a Partner with The Canada Consulting Group. From 1975 to 1981, he was the [[Principal Secretary (Canada)|Principal Secretary]] to Prime Minister [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau]].

In 1981, Trudeau appointed Liberal MP [[Peter Stollery]] to the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] so Coutts could run for the [[House of Commons of Canada]] in what was thought of as the safe Ontario riding of [[Spadina (electoral district)|Spadina]].  The plan backfired when Coutts narrowly lost to [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democrat]] [[Dan Heap]] despite personal interventions from Trudeau.  Coutts ran again, but lost by a heavier margin in the [[Canadian federal election, 1984|1984 election]].

He subsequently left politics and entered business with an international career in industrial explosives. He was a principal of Lowther Consultants Limited and the chairman and chief executive officer of CIC Canadian Investment Capital Limited.&lt;ref name=globe&gt;{{cite news|title=Jim Coutts, key adviser to former PMs Pearson and Trudeau, dies of cancer|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/key-adviser-to-former-pms-pearson-trudeau-dies-of-cancer/article16160079/|accessdate=January 1, 2014|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=January 1, 2014|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also a philanthropist and a major donor to the [[University of Lethbridge]].&lt;ref name=globe/&gt;

He was a member of the Board and Foundation of [[The Hospital for Sick Children]] and was a co-founder of the [[W.O. Mitchell Literary Prize]].

In 2001, he was made a Member of the [[Order of Canada]].

Coutts died of cancer on December 31, 2013.&lt;ref name=globe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gallant, Jacques|date=January 1, 2014| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/01/01/jim_coutts_pearson_and_trudeau_advisor_dead_at_75.html |title=Jim Coutts, Pearson and Trudeau advisor, dead at 75| newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|accessdate=June 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juan Mauricio Wurmser''' is a founding partner, President and [[CEO]] of [[Wurmser Ogilvy &amp; Mather]], the O&amp;M advertising firm in [[Guatemala]]. He is also founding partner and [[Chairman of Hill + Knowlton Strategies]] [[Guatemala]], the local subsidiary of this international public relations firm. He is a member of the Ogilvy Latina Executive Committee where he represents the Central American and Caribbean operations. Mr. Wurmser is involved in other business ventures in the marketing services and communications areas that include 141 Soho Square, MEC, Mindshare and Mediacom, all part of the WPP Group. He has more than 30 years of experience in the marketing of consumer goods throughout Latin America and a history of active participation in business chambers and organizations, as well as a spell of public service with the government of [[Guatemala]] .

==Prior History==
Prior to joining WO&amp;M and [[Hill and Knowlton]] [[Guatemala]] in mid-1998, Mr. Wurmser served as [[Minister of Economy]] of [[Guatemala]]. He was responsible for trade and industry promotion - with special emphasis on attracting foreign investment - and coordinated the regional and [[world|global]] economic integration efforts of the [[Arzú]] administration. He was a key member of the [[Guatemala]]n Economic Cabinet and sat on the Monetary Board where monetary, credit and exchange policies were defined. He was also Chairman of the Board of Governors of the [[Central American]] [[Bank of Economic]] Integration between 1997 and 1998.

Before taking up public service, Mr. Wurmser was responsible for developing and implementing the franchise program of [[Pollo Campero]], one of the most successful fast food restaurant chains in [[Central America]], which led to its [[international]] expansion.

His years as a corporate [[marketing]] executive include early assignments with the [[Guatemala]] subsidiaries of Warner Lambert, Avon, and [[Colgate-Palmolive]], before joining British American Tobacco in 1978, a company that he served for 15 years in [[Guatemala]], [[Panama]], [[Spain]], [[Mexico]], and [[Argentina]] before returning to [[Guatemala]] as President and General Manager of its local subsidiary.

Juan Mauricio has been committed to fostering Guatemala' s viability through his participation in business chambers and organisations through the years.

More recently, he was chosen by The Guatemalan Management Association as CEO of the Year 2015, one of the most coveted awards of the regional business community, followed by the early 2016 recognition as Guatemala's Entrepreneur of the Year by the Central American edition of The Economist magazine.

In mid 2016, affiliation agreements were signed by the Wurmser Communications Group with MEC and Mindshare, two of the global premier Media Investment Management companies, thus expanding further the WPP Group footprint in Guatemala and the Central American region.

==Other information==
A native of Guatemala [[City]], Mr. Wurmser holds a B.S. in business administration from [[The College of New Jersey]] (formerly Trenton State College) and also attended the graduate school of business of [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] in [[Guatemala]].

Mr. Wurmser has been a member of the Board of Directors of the Chamber of Industry of [[Guatemala]], was Chairman of the Business Chamber of [[Guatemala]] in 1993 and also sat on the Board of Directors of the [[American Chamber of Commerce]] of [[Guatemala]] ([[AMCHAM]]) in 2009. He has been a board member of the [[Guatemala]]n [[Advertising Association]] ([[UGAP]]) over the years, having chaired it in 2001 and in 2013-2014.  At present, he is also a member of the [[Board of Trustees]] of the [[Guatemala]] Development Foundation ([[FUNDESA]]) .

(Head Office: [[Tokyo]], Japan). Circulation is around 420,000. The newspaper was inaugurated in 1915. It covers economic and industrial affairs in general, and affairs of specific industries such as automobile, electronics, telecommunication, information technologies, science, etc.

Apart from publishing newspapers, the company publishes numerous books and free papers (namely Metro-Guide), and organizes trade fairs (Automotive Parts Product Solution Fair / [[International Robot Exhibition]] / Pan-Exhibition for Wash and Clean etc.) and seminars. Among them, collaboration with [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO) is a notable achievement. The two agencies jointly organized a seminar in June 2006, 2007 and 2008, namely "Global Auto Parts Business Seminar", for the purpose of further enhancing Japanese investment (especially auto-parts sector) at newly industrial states.   

The newspaper concluded an alliance with [[Asahi Shimbun]] and [[Jiji Press]] in February 2008. Three companies start a new service on information search by internet from April 2008. Japanese name is "KIJISAKU". More than eight million articles and information of three media agencies are put in this service.

'''Thomas Patrick Donovan''' (23 December 1936 &amp;ndash; 11 March 2018) was a New Zealand [[amateur boxer]] and [[rugby union]] player. He represented his country in boxing at the [[Boxing at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956]] and [[Boxing at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympic Games]], and won bronze medals at the [[Boxing at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|1958]] and [[Boxing at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]]. He also played representative rugby for {{Rut Hawke's Bay}}.

==Early life and family==
Born in [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]] on 23 December 1936, Donovan was the son of Tommy Donovan, who won the 1927 New Zealand amateur featherweight boxing title, and then had 46 professional bouts between 1929 and 1935.&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=12012003 |title=Olympics boxer Paddy Donovan dies in Napier |date=13 March 2018 |work=Hawke's Bay Today |first=Doug |last=Laing |accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paddy Donovan grew up on his family's farm at Meeanee, and was educated at [[St John's College, Hastings]], where he was head boy.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

==Boxing==
Donovan won his first national amateur boxing title, in the featherweight division, in 1954, while he was still at school.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt; He went on to win the national lightweight title four times—in 1956, 1957, 1959, and 1962—and he was awarded the Jameson Belt for the most scientific boxer in 1956, 1959, and 1962.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

Donovan won the bronze medal in the men's 57–60&amp;nbsp;kg (lightweight) division at the [[1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]]. Four years later at the [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]] he again won the bronze medal in the same division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org.nz/athletes/paddy-donovan/ |title=Paddy Donovan |year=2018 |publisher=New Zealand Olympic Committee | accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He competed at two [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympics]], not making it past the first round of the lightweight division in [[Boxing at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956]] and [[Boxing at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]],&lt;ref name="SportsReference"&gt;{{Cite sports-reference | Paddy Donovan | https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/do/paddy-donovan-1.html | 27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was controversially omitted from the New Zealand team for the [[New Zealand at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympics]].&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

A '''paper mill''' is a [[factory]] devoted to making [[paper]] from vegetable fibres such as [[wood pulp]], old rags and other ingredients. Prior to the invention and adoption of the [[Fourdrinier machine]] and other types of [[paper machine]] that use an endless belt, all paper in a paper mill was made by hand, one sheet at a time, by specialized laborers.

== History ==
{{See also|History of paper}}
[[Image:Forest Fibre Company Berlin, New Hampshire.JPG|thumb|left|A mid-19th century paper mill, the Forest Fibre Company, in [[Berlin, New Hampshire]]]]

Historical investigations into the origin of the paper mill are complicated by differing definitions and loose terminology from modern authors: Many modern scholars use the term to refer indiscriminately to all kinds of [[Mill (grinding)|mills]], whether powered by humans, [[horse mill|by animals]] or [[watermill|by water]]. Their propensity to refer to any ancient paper manufacturing centre as a "mill", without further specifying its exact power drive, has increased the difficulty of identifying the particularly efficient and historically important water-powered type.&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 414−417"&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414−417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human and animal-powered mills ===
The use of human and animal powered mills was known to Chinese and Muslim [[papermaking|papermakers]]. However, evidence for water-powered paper mills is elusive among both prior to the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin 1985, pp. 68−73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|2005|p=28, fn. 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 414fa."&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414f.}}: {{quote|It has also become universal to talk of paper "mills" (even of 400 such mills at [[Fes|Fez]]!), relating these to the hydraulic wonders of Islamic society in the east and west. All our evidence points to non-hydraulic hand production, however, at springs away from rivers which it could pollute.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson 1978, 169"&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|1978|p=169}}: {{quote|European papermaking differed from its precursors in the mechanization of the process and in the application of water power. [[Jean Gimpel]], in ''The Medieval Machine'' (the English translation of ''La Revolution Industrielle du Moyen Age''), points out that the Chinese and Arabs used only human and animal force. Gimpel goes on to say : "This is convincing evidence of how technologically minded the Europeans of that era were. Paper had traveled nearly halfway around the world, but no culture or civilization on its route had tried to mechanize its manufacture."'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general absence of the use of water-powered paper mills in Muslim papermaking prior to the 11th century is suggested by the habit of Muslim authors at the time to call a production center not a "mill", but a "paper manufactory".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414f.}}: {{quote|Indeed, Muslim authors in general call any "paper manufactory" a ''wiraqah'' - not a "mill" (''tahun'')}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have identified paper mills in [[Abbasid Dynasty|Abbasid]]-era [[Baghdad]] in 794–795. The evidence that waterpower was applied to papermaking at this time is a matter of scholarly debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|p=414}}:{{quote|Al-Hassan and Hill also use as evidence the statement by Robert Forbes in his multivolume Studies in Ancient Technology that "in the tenth century [AD] floating mills were found on the Tigris near Baghdad." Though such captive mills were known to the Romans and were used in 12th-century France, Forbes offers no citation or evidence for this unlikely application to very early papermaking. The most erudite authority on the topography of medieval Baghdad, George Makdisi, writes me that he has no recollection of such floating papermills or any papermills, which "I think I would have remembered."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] city of [[Fes|Fez]], [[Ibn Battuta]] speaks of "400 [[Millstone|mill stones]] for paper".&lt;ref name="Tschudin 1996, 423"/&gt; Since Ibn Battuta does not mention the use of water-power and such a number of water-mills would be grotesquely high, the passage is generally taken to refer to human or [[Horse mill|animal force]].&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 414fa."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tschudin 1996, 423"&gt;{{harvnb|Tschudin|1996|p=423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water-powered mills===

[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Nuremberga.png|thumb|Stromer's paper mill, the building complex at the far right bottom, in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' of 1493. Due to their noise and smell, papermills were required by medieval law to be erected some distance from the city walls.]]
An exhaustive survey of milling in [[Al-Andalus]] did not uncover water-powered paper mills, nor do the Spanish books of property distribution (''Repartimientos'') after the [[Reconquista|Christian reconquest]] refer to any.&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 414fb."&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic texts never use the term mill in connection with papermaking and the most thorough account of Muslim papermaking at the time, the one by the [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid]] Sultan [[Al-Muizz ibn Badis]], describes the art purely in terms of a handcraft.&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 414fb."/&gt; [[Donald Routledge Hill|Donald Hill]] has identified a possible reference to a water-powered paper mill in [[Samarkand]], in the 11th-century work of the Persian scholar [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]], but concludes that the passage is "too brief to enable us to say with certainty" that it refers to a water-powered paper mill.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A history of engineering in classical and medieval times|author=[[Donald Routledge Hill]]|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1996|isbn=0-415-15291-7|pages=169–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414}}: {{quote|Donald Hill has found a reference in al-Biruni in the 11th century to stones "fixed to axles across running water, as in Samarkand with the pounding of flax for paper," a possible exception to the rule. Hill finds the notice "too brief to enable us to say with certainty" that this was a water-powered triphammer.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen by Leor Halevi as evidence of Samarkand first harnessing waterpower in the production of paper, but notes that it is not known if waterpower was applied to papermaking elsewhere across the Islamic world at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Christian Impurity versus Economic Necessity: A Fifteenth-Century Fatwa on European Paper|author=Leor Halevi|journal=[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]|year=2008|volume=83|pages=917–945 [917–8]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|doi= 10.1017/S0038713400017073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert I. Burns remains sceptical, given the isolated occurrence of the reference and the prevalence of manual labour in Islamic papermaking elsewhere prior to the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 414−417"/&gt;

Hill notes that paper mills appear in early Christian [[Catalonia|Catalan]] documentation from the 1150s, which may imply Islamic origins, but that hard evidence is lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A history of engineering in classical and medieval times|author=[[Donald Routledge Hill]]|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1996|isbn=0-415-15291-7|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414f.}}: {{quote|[[Thomas F. Glick|Thomas Glick]] warily concludes that "it is assumed but not proved" that Islamic Xàtiva had hydraulic papermills, noting that the pertinent Arabic description was "a press." Since the "oldest" Catalan paper is physically the same as Islamic Xàtiva's, he notes, their techniques "can be presumed to have been identical" - reasonable enough for Catalan paper before 1280. My recent conversations with Glick indicate that he now inclines to non-hydraulic Andalusi papermaking.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns, however, has dismissed the case for early Catalan water-powered paper mills, after re-examination of the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=415}}: {{quote|Currently Oriol Valls i Subin't, director of the History of Paper department of the Museos Municipales de Historia in the Instituto Municipal de Historia at Barcelona, has popularized a version of that thesis, in which Christian paper mills multiplied marvelously along the Catalan rivers "from Tarragona to the Pyrenees" from 1113 to 1244. His many articles and two books, valuable for such topics as fiber analysis in medieval paper, continue to spread this untenable and indeed bizarre thesis. As Josep Madurell i Marimon shows in detail, these were all in fact cloth fulling mills; textiles were then the basic mechanized industry of the Christian west.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of early hydraulic stamping mills in medieval documents from [[Fabriano]], Italy, is also completely without substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=416}}: {{quote|Fabriano's claim rests on two charters - a gift of August 1276, and a sale of November 1278, to the new Benedictine congregation of Silvestrine monks at Montefano. In each, a woman recluse-hermit gives to the monastery her enclosure or "prison" - Latin ''carcer''; misread by Fabriano partisans as a form of Italian ''cartiera'' or paper mill! There is no papermaking in these documents, much less hydraulic mills.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clear evidence of a water-powered paper mill dates to 1282 in the Spanish [[Kingdom of Aragon]].&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 417f."&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=417f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decree by the Christian king [[Peter III of Aragon|Peter III]] addresses the establishment of a royal "[[Watermill|molendinum]]", a proper hydraulic mill, in the paper manufacturing centre of [[Xàtiva]].&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 417f."/&gt; This early hydraulic paper mill was operated by Muslim [[Mudéjar]] in the [[Moorish]] quarter of Xàtiva,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval Science, Technology, and Medicine: An Encyclopedia|author=[[Thomas F. Glick]]|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2014|page=385|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=77y2AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA385}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it appears to have been resented by sections of the local Muslim papermakering community; the document guarantees them the right to continue the way of traditional papermaking by beating the pulp manually and grants them the right to be exempted from work in the new mill.&lt;ref name="Burns 1996, 417f."/&gt;

The first permanent paper mill north of the Alps was established in [[Nuremberg]] by [[Ulman Stromer]] in 1390; it is later depicted in the lavishly illustrated ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stromer|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the mid-14th century onwards, European paper milling underwent a rapid improvement of many work processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stromer|1993|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of a paper mill prior to the use of industrial machines was described by counting the number of vats it had. Thus, a "one vat" paper mill had only one vatman, one coucher, and other laborers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Papermaking, the History and Technology of an Ancient Craft|author=[[Dard Hunter]]|publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]]|year=1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century ===
By the early 20th century, paper mills sprang up around [[New England]] and the rest of the world, due to the high demand for paper. At this time, there were many world leaders of the production of paper; one such was the [[Brown Company]] in [[Berlin, New Hampshire]] run by William Wentworth Brown. During the year 1907, the Brown Company cut between 30 and 40 million acres of woodlands on their property,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MxILAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA70 |title= History of the lumber industry of America|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which extended from [[La Tuque, Quebec|La Tuque]], [[Quebec province|Quebec]], Canada to [[West Palm, Florida|West Palm]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlinnh.gov/Pages/BerlinNH_WebDocs/BerlinHistory|title=About Berlin: Berlin History|accessdate=April 5, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109062959/http://www.berlinnh.gov/Pages/BerlinNH_WebDocs/BerlinHistory|archivedate=November 9, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s [[Nancy Baker Tompkins]] represented large paper manufacturing companies, like Hammermill Paper Company, Honolulu Paper Company and Appleton Coated Paper Company to promote sales to the distributors of paper products. It was (said to be) the only business of its kind in the world and was started in 1931 by Tompkins and prospered in spite of the business depression.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Monday, July 9, 1934|journal=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|date=1934|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/274992413/?terms=%22Nancy%2BBaker%2BTompkins%22|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“[[Log driver|Log drives]]” were conducted on local rivers to send the logs to the mills. By the late 20th and early 21st-century, paper mills began to close and the log drives became a dying craft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pprc.info/html/millclosures.htm|title=Paper Mill Closures of America|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the addition of new machinery, many millworkers were laid off and many of the historic paper mills closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://worldofdecay.blogspot.com/2010/10/lumber-town-berlin-new-hampshire.html|title=Urban Decay|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
{{Main|Pulp mill|Paper machine}}
Paper mills can be fully integrated mills or nonintegrated mills. Integrated mills consist of a pulp mill and a paper mill on the same site. Such mills receive logs or wood chips and produce paper.

The modern paper mill uses large amounts of [[energy]], [[water]], and [[wood pulp]] in an efficient and complex series of processes, and control [[technology]] to produce a sheet of paper that can be used in diverse ways.  Modern paper machines can be {{convert|500|ft}} in length, produce a sheet {{convert|400|in|m}} wide, and operate at speeds of more than {{convert|60|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metsoautomation.com/News/newsdocuments.nsf/Web2NewsDoc/CAC7C79ED6B6E117C22572A00048448C?OpenDocument&amp;ch=ChMetsoPaperWebEng&amp;id=CAC7C79ED6B6E117C22572A00048448C&amp;|title=Metso supplied SC paper machine line sets a new world speed record at Stora Enso Kvarnsveden|accessdate=2008-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main suppliers of paper machines are [[Metso]] and [[Voith]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43659">'''Psychiatric nursing''' or '''[[mental health nurse|mental health nursing]]''' is the appointed position of a [[nursing|nurse]] that specialises in [[mental health]], and cares for people of all ages experiencing [[mental disorder|mental illnesses]] or [[mental distress|distress]].  These include: [[schizophrenia]], [[schizoaffective disorder]], [[mood disorder|mood disorders]], [[anxiety disorder|anxiety disorders]], [[personality disorder|personality disorders]], [[eating disorder|eating disorders]], [[suicidal ideation|suicidal thoughts]], [[psychosis]], [[paranoia]], and [[self-harm]].

Nurses in this area receive specific training in [[psychotherapy|psychological therapies]], building a [[therapeutic alliance]], dealing with [[challenging behaviour]], and the administration of [[psychiatric medication]].

In most countries, a psychiatric nurse will have to attain a [[bachelor's degree]] in nursing to become a [[Registered nurse|Registered Nurse (RN)]], and specialise in mental health. Degrees vary in different countries, and are governed by country-specific regulations.

Mental health nurses can work in a variety of services, including: [[Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services|Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS)]], [[Acute medical unit|Acute Medical Units (AMUs)]], [[Psychiatric intensive-care unit|Psychiatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs)]], and [[Community mental health service|Community Mental Health Services (CMHS)]].

== History ==
[[File:Civilian Public Service -93, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, psychiatric nursing class (8389167373).jpg|alt=Civilian Public Service -93, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, psychiatric nursing class (8389167373)|thumb|Civilian Public Service -93, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, psychiatric nursing class (8389167373)]]
The history of [[psychiatry]] and psychiatric nursing, although disjointed, can be traced back to ancient philosophical thinkers. [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]], in particular, was the first known person to create a questionnaire for the mentally ill using biographical information to determine the best course of psychological treatment and care.&lt;ref name="Alfredo, D. 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Alfredo |first=D. |year=2009 |title=The History of Psychiatric Nursing}} {{full|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the first known psychiatric care centers were constructed in the Middle East during the 8th century. The medieval Muslim physicians and their attendants relied on clinical observations for diagnosis and treatment.&lt;ref name="Alexander, F. 1967"&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander |first=F. |last2=Selesnick |first2=S. T. |year=1967 |title=The History of Psychiatry: An Evaluation of Psychiatric Thought and Practice from Prehistoric Times to the Present |location=Michigan |publisher=Allen and Unwin}}{{pn|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 13th century medieval Europe, psychiatric hospitals were built to house the mentally ill, but there were not any nurses to care for them and treatment was rarely provided. These facilities functioned more as a housing unit for the insane.&lt;ref name="Alexander, F. 1967"/&gt; Throughout the high point of Christianity in Europe, hospitals for the mentally ill believed in using religious intervention. The insane were partnered with “soul friends” to help them reconnect with society. Their primary concern was befriending the melancholy and disturbed, forming intimate spiritual relationships. Today, these soul friends are seen as the first modern psychiatric nurses.&lt;ref name="Nolan, P. 1993"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nolan |first=P. |year=1993 |title=A History of Mental Health Nursing |location=United Kingdom |publisher=Stanley Thornes Ltd.}}{{pn|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the colonial era of the United States, some settlers adapted community health nursing practices. Individuals with mental defects that were deemed as dangerous were incarcerated or kept in cages, maintained and paid fully by community attendants. Wealthier colonists kept their insane relatives either in their attics or cellars and hired attendants, or nurses, to care for them. In other communities, the mentally ill were sold at auctions as slave labor. Others were forced to leave town.&lt;ref name="Levine, M. 1981"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levine |first=M. |year=1981 |title=The History and Politics of Community Mental Health |location=United States |publisher= Oxford Press}}{{pn|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the population in the colonies expanded, informal care for the community failed and small institutions were established. In 1752 the first “lunatics ward” was opened at the [[Pennsylvania Hospital]] which attempted to treat the mentally ill. Attendants used the most modern treatments of the time: purging, bleeding, blistering, and shock techniques. Overall, the attendants caring for the patients believed in treating the institutionalized with respect. They believed if the patients were treated as reasonable people, then they would act as such; if they gave them confidence, then patients would rarely abuse it.&lt;ref name="Levine, M. 1981"/&gt;

The 1790s saw the beginnings of [[moral treatment]] being introduced for people with mental distress.&lt;ref name="Videbeck, S. L. 2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Videbeck |first=S. L. |year=2008 |title=Psychiatric- Mental Health Nursing |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkes}}{{pn|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a safe asylum, proposed by [[Philippe Pinel]] and [[William Tuke]], offered protection and care at institutions for patients who had been previously abused or enslaved.&lt;ref name="Videbeck, S. L. 2008"/&gt; In the United States, [[Dorothea Dix]] was instrumental in opening 32 state asylums to provide quality care for the ill. Dix also was in charge of the Union Army Nurses during the [[American Civil War]], caring for both Union and Confederate soldiers. Although it was a promising movement, attendants and nurses were often accused of abusing or neglecting the residents and isolating them from their families.&lt;ref name="Videbeck, S. L. 2008"/&gt;

The formal recognition of [[psychiatry]] as a modern and legitimate profession occurred in 1808.&lt;ref name="Alexander, F. 1967"/&gt; In Europe, one of the major advocates for mental health nursing to help psychiatrists was Dr. William Ellis. He proposed giving the “keepers of the insane” better pay and training so more respectable, intelligent people would be attracted to the profession. In his 1836 publication of ''Treatise on Insanity'', he openly stated that an established nursing practice calmed depressed patients and gave hope to the hopeless.&lt;ref name="Nolan, P. 1993"/&gt; However, psychiatric nursing was not formalized in the United States until 1882 when [[Linda Richards]] opened Boston City College. This was the first school specifically designed to train nurses in psychiatric care.&lt;ref name="Boyd, M. 1998"/&gt;

The discrepancy between the founding of [[psychiatry]] and the recognition of trained nurses in the field is largely attributed to the attitudes in the 19th century which opposed training women to work in the medical field.&lt;ref name="Alfredo, D. 2009"/&gt;

In 1913 [[Johns Hopkins University]] was the first college of nursing in the United States to offer psychiatric nursing as part of its general curriculum. The first psychiatric nursing textbook, ''Nursing Mental Diseases'' by [[Harriet Bailey]], was not published until 1920. It was not until 1950 when the National League for Nursing required all nursing schools to include a clinical experience in [[psychiatry]] to receive national accreditation.&lt;ref name="Videbeck, S. L. 2008"/&gt; The first psychiatric nurses faced difficult working conditions. Overcrowding, under-staffing and poor resources required the continuance of custodial care. They were pressured by an increasing patient population that rose dramatically by the end of the 19th century. As a result, labor organizations formed to fight for better pay and fewer hours.&lt;ref name="Nolan, P. 1993"/&gt; Additionally, large asylums were founded to hold the large number of mentally ill, including the famous [[Kings Park Psychiatric Center]] in Long Island, New York. At its peak in the 1950s, the center housed more than 33,000 patients and required its own power plant. Nurses were often called “attendants” to imply a more humanitarian approach to care. During this time, attendants primarily kept the facilities clean and maintained order among the patients. They also carried out orders from the physicians.&lt;ref name="Nolan, P. 1993"/&gt;

In 1963, President [[John F. Kennedy]] accelerated the trend towards deinstitutionalization with the [[Community Mental Health Act]]. Also, since psychiatric drugs were becoming more available allowing patients to live on their own and the asylums were too expensive, institutions began shutting down.&lt;ref name="Nolan, P. 1993"/&gt; Nursing care thus became more intimate and holistic. Expanded roles were also developed in the 1960s allowing nurses to provide outpatient services such as counseling, psychotherapy, consultations, prescribing medications, along with the diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses.&lt;ref name="Boyd, M. 1998"/&gt;

The first developed standard of care was created by the psychiatric division of the [[American Nurses Association]] (ANA) in 1973. This standard outlined the responsibilities and expected quality of care of nurses.&lt;ref name="Videbeck, S. L. 2008"/&gt;

In 1975, the government published a document called "Better Services for the Mentally Ill" which reviewed the current standards of psychiatric nursing worldwide and laid out better plans for the future of mental health nursing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vo46Jqvu_8oC|title=A History of Mental Health Nursing|last=Nolan|first=Peter|date=2000-10-01|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=9780748737215|language=en}}{{pn|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global health care underwent huge expansions in the 1980s, this was due to the governments reaction from the fast increasing demand on health care services. The expansion was continued until the economic crisis of the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1982, the Area Health Authorities was terminated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1983, better structure of hospitals was implemented. General managers were introduced to make decisions, thus creating a better system of operation. 1983 also saw a lot of staff cuts which was heavily felt by all the mental health nurses. However a new training syllabus was introduced in 1982, which offered suitable knowledgeable nurses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 2000s have seen major educational upgrades for nurses to specialise in mental health as well as various financial opportunities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Assessment ==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
The term mental health encompasses a great deal about a single person, including how we feel, how we behave, and how well we function. This single aspect of our person cannot be measured or easily reported but it is possible to obtain a global picture by collecting subjective and objective information to delve into a person’s true mental health and well being. When identifying mental health wellness and planning interventions, here are a few things gathered from the Mental Health Association of Southern Pennsylvania&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://retirementconnection.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/MHRN-Nursing-in-the-Home-Care-Setting.pdf|title=Mental Health Association of Southern Pennsylvania|last=Slemenda|first=Robin|date=2010|website=Mental Health Registered Nursing|publisher=Benedictine Home Health|access-date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to keep in mind when completing a thorough mental health assessment in the nursing profession:
* Is the patient sleeping adequate hours on a regular sleeping cycle?
* Does the patient have a lack of interest in communication with other people?
* Is the patient eating and maintaining an adequate nutritional status?
* Is the ability to perform activities of daily living present (bathing, dressing, toileting one self)?
* Can the patient contribute to society and maintain employment?
* Is the ability to reason present?
* Is safety a recurring issue?
* Does the patient often make decisions without regards to their own safety or the safety of others?
* Does the patient show a difficulty with memory or recognizance?&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Interventions ==
Nursing interventions may be divided into the following categories:&lt;ref name="Boyd, M. 1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boyd|first1=Mary Ann|last2=Nihart|first2=M|title=Psychiatric Nursing: Contemporary Practice|date=1998|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-397-55178-1}}{{pn|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical and biological interventions ===
==== Psychiatric medication ====
[[Psychiatric medication]] is a commonly used intervention and many psychiatric [[mental health nurse|mental health nurses]] are involved in the administration of medicines, both in oral (e.g. tablet or liquid) form or by [[intramuscular injection]]. [[Nurse practitioners]] can prescribe medication.  Nurses will monitor for [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] and response to these [[medical]] treatments by using assessments. Nurses will also offer information on medication so that, where possible, the person in care can make an informed choice, using the best [[Evidence based medicine|evidence]], available.

==== Electroconvulsive therapy ====
Psychiatric mental health nurses are also involved in the administration of the treatment of [[electroconvulsive therapy]] and assist with the preparation and recovery from the treatment, which involves [[anesthesia]]. This treatment is only used in a tiny proportion of cases and only after all other possible treatments have been exhausted.
 
A patients consent to receive the treatment must be established and defended by the nurse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Varcarolis|first=Elizabeth M.|title=Essentials of Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mtbsAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90|date=12 March 2014|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-323-29415-7|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Physical care ====
Along with other nurses, psychiatric mental health nurses will intervene in areas of physical need to ensure that people have good levels of personal hygiene, nutrition, sleep, etc., as well as tending to any concomitant physical ailments.

=== Psychosocial interventions ===
Psychosocial interventions are increasingly delivered by nurses in mental health settings. These include [[psychotherapy]] interventions, such as [[cognitive behavioural therapy]], [[family therapy]], and less commonly other interventions, such as [[Integrative milieu model|milieu therapy]] or [[psychodynamic]] approaches. These interventions can be applied to a broad range of problems including psychosis, depression, and anxiety. Nurses will work with people over a period of time and use [[psychological]] methods to teach the person psychological techniques that they can then use to aid [[recovery approach|recovery]] and help manage any future [[existential crisis|crisis]] in their mental health. In practice, these interventions will be used often, in conjunction with psychiatric medications. Psychosocial interventions are based on [[evidence-based practice]], and therefore the techniques tend to follow set guidelines based upon what has been demonstrated to be effective by [[nursing research]]. There has been some criticism&lt;ref name=pmid12199882&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1440-1800.2002.00151.x |pmid=12199882 |title=Recognising relationships: Reflections on evidence-based practice |journal=Nursing Inquiry |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=179–86 |year=2002 |last1=Kitson |first1=Alison }}&lt;/ref&gt; that evidence based practice is focused primarily on [[quantitative research]] and should reflect also a more [[qualitative research]] approach that seeks to understand the meaning of people's experience.

=== Spiritual interventions ===
The basis of this approach is to look at mental illness or distress from the perspective of a [[spiritual crisis]]. Spiritual interventions focus on developing a sense of meaning, purpose, and hope for the person in their current life experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swinton|first=John|title=Spirituality and Mental Health Care|publisher=Jessica Kingsley|year=2001|isbn=978-1-85302-804-5}}{{pn|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual interventions involve listening to the person's story and facilitating the person to connect to [[God]], a greater power or greater whole, perhaps by using [[meditation]] or [[prayer]]. This may be a [[religious]] or non-religious experience depending on the individual's own spirituality. Spiritual interventions, along with psychosocial interventions, emphasize the importance of engagement, however, spiritual interventions focus more on caring and 'being with' the person during their time of crisis, rather than intervening and trying and 'fix' the problem. Spiritual interventions tend to be based on [[qualitative research]] and share some similarities with the [[humanistic psychology|humanistic]] approach to psychotherapy.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

=== Therapeutic relationship ===
As with other areas of [[nursing practice]], psychiatric mental health nursing works within [[nursing theory|nursing models]], utilising [[nursing care plan|nursing care plans]], and seeks to care for the whole person. However, the emphasis of [[mental health nurse|mental health nursing]] is on the development of a [[therapeutic relationship|therapeutic alliance]].&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Wilkin P (2003). ''in:'' {{cite book | author=Barker, P (ed)| title=Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing: The craft of caring| location=London | publisher=Arnold | pages = 26–33|isbn=978-0-340-81026-2 | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, this means that the nurse should seek to engage with the person in care in a positive and collaborative way that will empower the patient to draw on his or her inner resources in addition to any other treatment they may be receiving.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;

===Therapeutic relationship aspects of psychiatric nursing===
[[File:Navy nurse corps 1908.jpg|thumb|In 1913, [[Johns Hopkins University]] was the first college of nursing in the United States to offer psychiatric nursing as part of its general curriculum.]]

The most important duty of a psychiatric nurse is to maintain a positive therapeutic relationship with patients in a clinical setting. The fundamental elements of mental health care revolve around the interpersonal relations and interactions established between professionals and clients. Caring for people with [[mental disorder|mental illnesses]] demands an intensified presence and a strong desire to be supportive.&lt;ref name=Berg&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2850.2000.00307.x |pmid=11933404 |title=Psychiatric nurses' lived experiences of working with inpatient care on a general team psychiatric ward |journal=Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=323–33 |year=2000 |last1=Berg |first1=A |last2=Hallberg |first2=I. R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dziopa and Ahern assert that there are nine critical mental health aspects of the psychiatric nursing practicum: [[understanding]] and [[empathy]], [[person-centered care|individuality]], [[social support|providing support]], [[quality time|being there and being available]], [[sincerity|being genuine]], [[social equality|promoting equality]], [[respect|demonstrating respect]], [[professional boundaries|demonstrating clear boundaries]], and [[self-awareness|demonstrating self-awareness]] for the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Fiona |last1=Dziopa |first2=Kathy |last2=Ahern |title=What makes a quality therapeutic relationship in psychiatric/mental health nursing: a review of the research literature |journal=Internet Journal of Advanced Nursing Practice |volume=10 |issue=1 |year=2009 |pages=1–19 |url=http://ispub.com/IJANP/10/1/7218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Understanding and empathy====
Understanding and empathy from psychiatric nurses reinforces a positive psychological balance for patients. Conveying an understanding is important because it provides patients with a sense of importance.&lt;ref name=pmid12956021&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1440-0979.2003.00276.x |pmid=12956021 |title=Nurse-patient relationship: A dichotomy of expectations |journal=International Journal of Mental Health Nursing |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=103–9 |year=2003 |last1=Moyle |first1=Wendy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression of thoughts and feelings should be encouraged without blaming, judging, or belittling.&lt;ref name="transformative2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1440-0979.2002.00245.x |pmid=12510595 |title=Transformative change of self: The unique focus of (adolescent) mental health nursing? |journal=International Journal of Mental Health Nursing |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=174–85 |year=2002 |last1=Geanellos |first1=Rene }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling important is significant to the lives of people who live in a structured society, who often [[social stigma|stigmatise]] the mentally ill because of their disorder.&lt;ref name=pmid17635627&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1447-0349.2007.00477.x |pmid=17635627 |title='Take my hand, help me out': Mental health service recipients' experience of the therapeutic relationship |journal=International Journal of Mental Health Nursing |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=274–84 |year=2007 |last1=Shattell |first1=Mona M |last2=Starr |first2=Sharon S |last3=Thomas |first3=Sandra P |url=https://works.bepress.com/mona_shattell/26/download/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Empowering patients with feelings of importance will bring them closer to the normality they had before the onset of their disorder. When subjected to fierce personal attacks, the psychiatric nurse retained the desire and ability to understand the patient. The ability to quickly empathise with unfortunate situations proves essential. Involvedness is also required when patients expect nursing staff to understand even when they are unable to express their needs verbally.&lt;ref name=Berg/&gt; When a psychiatric nurse gains understanding of the patient, the chances of improving overall treatment greatly increases.

====Individuality====
[[person-centered care|Individualised care]] becomes important when nurses need to get to know the patient. To lives this knowledge the psychiatric nurse must see patients as individual people with lives beyond their mental illness. Seeing people as individuals with lives beyond their mental illness is imperative in making patients feel valued and respected.&lt;ref name=pmid12907378&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/01612840305320 |pmid=12907378 |title=Therapeutic Relationships and Boundary Maintenance: The Perspective of Forensic Patients Enrolled in a Treatment Program for Violent Offenders |journal=Issues in Mental Health Nursing |volume=24 |issue=6–7 |pages=605–25 |year=2009 |last1=Schafer |first1=Penny |last2=Peternelj-Taylor |first2=Cindy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to accept the patient as an individual, the psychiatric nurse must not be controlled by his or her own values, or by ideas, and pre-understanding of mental health patients.&lt;ref name=pmid14629636&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.0283-9318.2003.00233.x |pmid=14629636 |title=Patients' opinion on what constitutes good psychiatric care |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=339–46 |year=2003 |last1=Johansson |first1=Håkan |last2=Eklund |first2=Mona }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual needs of patients are met by bending the rules of standard interventions and assessment. Psychiatric nurses spoke of the potential to 'bend the rules', which required an interpretation of the unit rules, and the ability to evaluate the risks associated with bending them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10855090 |year=1999 |author1=O'Brien |first1=A. J |title=Negotiating the relationship: Mental health nurses' perceptions of their practice |journal=The Australian and New Zealand journal of mental health nursing |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=153–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Providing support====
Successful [[therapeutic relationship|therapeutic relationships]] between nurses and patients need to have positive support. Different methods of providing patients with support include many active responses.&lt;ref name=pmid17635627/&gt; Minor activities, such as shopping, reading the newspaper together, or taking lunch or dinner breaks with patients can improve the quality of support provided.&lt;ref name=pmid15720494&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2850.2004.00774.x |pmid=15720494 |title=Trust as a foundation for the therapeutic intervention for patients with borderline personality disorder |journal=Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=23–32 |year=2005 |last1=Langley |first1=G. C |last2=Klopper |first2=H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical support may also be used and is manifested through the use of touch.&lt;ref name=pmid15720494/&gt; Patients described feelings of [[haptic communication|connection]] when nurses hugged them or put a hand on their shoulder.&lt;ref name=pmid17635627/&gt; Psychiatric nurses in Berg and Hallberg's study described an element of a working relationship as comforting through holding a patient's hand.&lt;ref name="Berg"/&gt; Patients with depression described relief when the nurse embraced them.&lt;ref name=pmid12956021/&gt; Physical touch is intended to comfort and console patients who are willing to embrace these sensations and share mutual feelings with nurses.

====Being there and being available====
In order to make patients feel more comfortable, the patient care providers make themselves more approachable, therefore more readily open to multiple levels of personal connections. Such personal connections have the ability to uplift patients’ spirits and secure confidentiality. Utilisation of the [[quality time|quality of time]] spent with the patient proves to be beneficial. By being available for a proper amount of time, patients open up and disclose personal stories, which enable nurses to understand the meaning behind each story.&lt;ref name=pmid14629636/&gt; The outcome results in nurses making every effort to attain a non-biased point of view.&lt;ref name=pmid14629636/&gt; A combination of being there and being available allows empirical connections to quell any negative feelings within patients.

====Being genuine====
The act of being genuine must come from within and be expressed by nurses without reluctance. Genuineness requires the nurse to be natural or authentic in their interactions with the patient.&lt;ref name=pmid12801401&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2648.2003.02677.x |pmid=12801401 |title=Being professional and being human: One nurse's relationship with a psychiatric patient |journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=101–8 |year=2003 |last1=Hem |first1=Marit Helene |last2=Heggen |first2=Kristin }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his article about pivotal moments in therapeutic relationships, Welch found that nurses must be in accordance with their values and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1440-0979.2005.00376.x |pmid=16181152 |title=Pivotal moments in the therapeutic relationship |journal=International Journal of Mental Health Nursing |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=161–5 |year=2005 |last1=Welch |first1=Mark }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the previous concept, O’Brien &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1440-0979.2000.00171.x |pmid=11887269 |title=Nurse-client relationships: The experience of community psychiatric nurses |journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Mental Health Nursing |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=184–94 |year=2000 |last1=O'Brien |first1=Louise }}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that being consistent and reliable in both punctuality and character makes for genuinity. Schafer and Peternelj-Taylor &lt;ref name=pmid12907378/&gt; believe that a nurses 'genuineness' is determined through the level of consistency displayed between their verbal and non-verbal behaviour. Similarly, Scanlon&lt;ref name=pmid16737499&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2850.2006.00958.x |pmid=16737499 |title=Psychiatric nurses perceptions of the constituents of the therapeutic relationship: A grounded theory study |journal=Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=319–29 |year=2006 |last1=Scanlon |first1=A }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that genuineness was expressed by fulfilling intended tasks. [[Self-disclosure]] proves to be the key to being open and honest.&lt;ref name=pmid10672096&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2648.2000.01288.x |pmid=10672096 |title=What do people need psychiatric and mental health nurses for? |journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=378–88 |year=2000 |last1=Jackson |first1=Sue |last2=Stevenson |first2=Chris }}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the nurse sharing life experiences and is essential to the development of the therapeutic relationship, because as the relationship grows patients are reluctant to give any more information if they feel the relationship is too one sided.&lt;ref name=pmid10672096/&gt; Multiple authors found genuine emotion, such as tearfulness, blunt feedback, and straight talk facilitated the therapeutic relationship in the pursuit of being open and honest.&lt;ref name=pmid17635627/&gt; The friendship of a [[therapeutic relationship]] is different from a sociable friendship because the therapeutic relationship friendship is asymmetrical in nature.&lt;ref name=pmid17635627/&gt; The basic concept of genuineness is centered on being true to one’s word. Patients would not trust nurses who fail in complying with what they say or promise.

====Promoting equality====
For a successful therapeutic relationship to form, a beneficial co-dependency between the nurse and patient must be established. A derogatory view of the patient’s role in the clinical setting dilapidates a therapeutic alliance. While patients need nurses to support their recovery, psychiatric nurses need patients to develop skills and experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1351-0126.2001.00457.x |pmid=11896864 |title='Partnership': A co-operative inquiry between Community Mental Health Nurses and their clients. 2. The nurse-client relationship |journal=Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=111–7 |year=2002 |last1=Hostick |first1=T |last2=McClelland |first2=F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatric nurses convey themselves as team members or facilitators of the relationship, rather than the leaders.&lt;ref name=pmid17635627/&gt; By empowering the patient with a sense of control and involvement, nurses encourage the patient's independence.&lt;ref name=pmid17635627/&gt; Sole control of certain situations should not be embedded in the nurse. Equal interactions are established when nurses talk to patients one-on-one. Participating in activities that do not make one person more dominant over the other, such as talking about a mutual interest or getting lunch together strengthen the levels of equality shared between professionals and patients. This can also create the "illusion of choice"; giving the patient options, even if limited or confined within structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2850.2004.00763.x |pmid=15450025 |title=Conversation starters: Re-examining and reconstructing first encounters within the therapeutic relationship |journal=Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=575–82 |year=2004 |last1=McAllister |first1=M |last2=Matarasso |first2=B |last3=Dixon |first3=B |last4=Shepperd |first4=C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Demonstrating respect====
To develop a quality therapeutic relationship, nurses need to make patients feel respected and important.&lt;ref name=pmid14629636/&gt; Accepting patient faults and problems is vital to convey respect—helping the patient see themselves as worthy and worthwhile.&lt;ref name="transformative2002"/&gt;

====Demonstrating clear boundaries====
[[professional boundaries|Boundaries]] are essential for protecting both the patient and the nurse, and maintaining a functional therapeutic relationship. Limit setting helps to shield the patient from embarrassing behaviour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1440-0979.2005.00363.x |pmid=15896254 |title=The attitudes, knowledge and skills needed in mental health nurses: The perspective of users of mental health services |journal=International Journal of Mental Health Nursing |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=78–87 |year=2005 |last1=Rydon |first1=Sharon E }}&lt;/ref&gt; and instills the patient with feelings of safety and containment.&lt;ref name=pmid15720494/&gt; Limit setting also protects the nurse from "[[occupational burnout|burnout]]”,&lt;ref name=pmid15720494/&gt; preserving personal stability—thus promoting a quality relationship.

====Demonstrating self-awareness====
Psychiatric nurses recognise personal vulnerability in order to develop professionally.&lt;ref name=pmid12801401/&gt; Humanistic insight, basic human values, and self-knowledge improves the depth of understanding the self.&lt;ref name=pmid12358707&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2850.2002.00538.x |pmid=12358707 |title=Swedish forensic nursing care: Nurses' professional contributions and educational needs |journal=Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=531–9 |year=2002 |last1=Rask |first1=Mikael |last2=Aberg |first2=Jonas }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different personalities affect the way psychiatric nurses respond to their patients. The more self-aware, the more knowledge on how to approach interactions with patients nurses have.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Interpersonal skills needed to form relationships with patients were acquired through learning about oneself.&lt;ref name=pmid16737499/&gt; Clinical supervision was found to provide the opportunity for nurses to reflect on patient relationships,&lt;ref name="ClearyEdwards1999"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1440-0979.1999.00141.x |pmid=10661080 |title=Factors influencing nurse-patient interaction in the acute psychiatric setting: An exploratory investigation |journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Mental Health Nursing |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=109–16 |year=1999 |last1=Cleary |first1=Michelle |last2=Edwards |first2=Clair |last3=Meehan |first3=Tom }}&lt;/ref&gt; to improve clinical skills, &lt;ref name=pmid12358707/&gt; and to help repair difficult relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1744-6163.1998.tb00998.x |pmid=9847826 |title=Factors Influencing Movement of Chronic Psychiatric Patients from the Orientation to the Working Phase of the Nurse-Client Relationship on an Inpatient Unit |journal=Perspectives in Psychiatric Care |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=36–44 |year=1998 |last1=Forchuk |first1=Cheryl |last2=Westwell |first2=Jan |last3=Martin |first3=Mary-Lou |last4=Azzapardi |first4=Wendy Bamber |last5=Kosterewa-Tolman |first5=Donna |last6=Hux |first6=Margaret }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reflections &lt;ref name=pmid14629636/&gt; articulated by nurses through clinical supervision help foster self-awareness.

===Canada===
The ''registered psychiatric nurse'' is a distinct nursing profession in all of the four western provinces.  Such nurses carry the designation "[[Registered Psychiatric Nurse|RPN]]". In Eastern Canada, an Americanized system of psychiatric nursing is followed. Registered Psychiatric Nurses can also work in all three of the territories in Canada; although, the registration process to work in the territories varies as the psychiatric nurses must be licensed by one of the four provinces.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], mental health nurses undergo a 4-year honors degree training programme. Nurses that trained under the diploma course in Ireland can do a post graduation course to bring their status from diploma to degree.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

===New Zealand===
Mental Health Nurses in New Zealand require a diploma or degree in nursing.  All nurses are now trained in both general and mental health, as part of their three-year degree training programme.  Mental health nurses are often requested to complete a graduate diploma or a post graduate certificate in mental health, if they are employed by a District Health Board.  This gives additional training that is specific to working with people with mental health issues.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

===Sweden===
In [[Sweden]], to become a ''registered psychiatric nurse'' one must first become a registered nurse which requires a BSc.

However, unlike in countries such as the US, there is no [[psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner]], so in Sweden, the profession cannot for example prescribe pharmacological treatment.&lt;ref&gt;"Kompetensbeskrivning för legitimerad sjuksköterska med specialistsjuksköterskeexamen, inriktning psykiatrisk vård".

===UK===
In the [[UK]] and Ireland the term ''psychiatric nurse'' has now largely been replaced with ''mental health nurse''. Mental health nurses undergo a 3-4 year training programme at Bachelor's degree level, or a 2 year training programme at Master's degree level, in common with other nurses. However, most of their training is specific to caring for clients with mental health issues. 

RMNs can continue into further training as Advanced Nurse Practitioners (ANPs): this requires completion of a 9 month Master's programme. The role includes prescribing medications, being on call for hospital wards and delivering psychosocial interventions to clients.

===US===
In [[North America]], there are three levels of psychiatric nursing.
* The ''[[licensed vocational nurse]]'' (''[[licensed practical nurse]]'' in some states) and the ''[[licensed psychiatric technician]]'' may dispense medication and assist with data collection regarding psychiatric and mental health clients.
* The ''registered nurse'' or ''registered psychiatric nurse'' has the additional scope of performing assessments and may provide other therapies such as counseling and milieu therapy.
* The ''[[advanced practice registered nurse]]'' (APRN) either practices as a [[clinical nurse specialist]] or a [[nurse practitioner]] after obtaining a master's degree in psychiatric-mental health nursing. Psychiatric-mental health nursing (PMHN) is a nursing specialty. The course work in a master's degree program includes specialty practice. APRN’s assess, diagnose, and treat individuals or families with psychiatric problems/disorders or the potential for such disorders, as well as performing the functions associated with the basic level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apna.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3292 APNA About Psychiatric Mental Health Nurses]&lt;/ref&gt; They provide a full range of primary mental health care services to individuals, families, groups and communities, function as psychotherapists, educators, consultants, advanced case managers, and administrators. In many states, APRN’s have the authority to prescribe medications. Qualified to practice independently, psychiatric-mental health APRN’s offer direct care services in a variety of settings: mental health centers, community mental health programs, homes, offices, HMOs, etc.

Psychiatric nurses who earn doctoral degrees (PhD, DNSc, EdD) often are found in practice settings, teaching, doing research, or as administrators in hospitals, agencies or schools of nursing.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, to be a psychiatric nurse a bachelor's degree of nursing need to be obtained in order to become a registered nurse (RN) and this degree takes 3 years full-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mhsa.aihw.gov.au/resources/workforce/mental-health-nursing-workforce/|title=Mental health nurse workforce|website=mhsa.aihw.gov.au|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then a diploma in mental health or something similar will need to also be obtained, this is an additional year of study. An Australian psychiatric nurse has duties that may include assessing patients who are mentally ill, observation, helping patients take part in activities, giving medication, observing if the medication is working, assisting in behaviour change programs or visiting patients who are at home. Australian nurses can work in public or private hospitals, institutes, correctional institutes, mental care facilities and homes of the patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acmhn.org/about-us/about-mh-nursing|title=About MH Nursing|website=www.acmhn.org|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Risdon Archibald Beazley''' (1904&amp;ndash;1979) was the founder of Risdon Beazley Ltd, a [[Marine salvage]] company that operated from 1926 to 1981 in [[Southampton]], [[England]].

==Early career==
Beazley formed his company in 1926, when he was 22 years old. Throughout the life of the companies their base remained at Clausentum Yard, [[Bitterne Manor]], [[Southampton]]. By the 1930s Risdon Beazley Ltd. was undertaking demolition work and wreck removal. In 1936 Beazley was a partner in the salvage of the square rigger ''[[Herzogin Cecilie]]''. In 1937 the British cargo ship ''[[English Trader]]'' went ashore whilst entering [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] Harbour; Risdon Beazley removed and cut up the bow section. In the same year ''Kantoeng'', then the largest tin [[dredging|dredge]] in the world, capsized whilst under tow of [[Smit International]] tugs; Risdon Beazley removed the hull.

==War years==
At the outbreak of [[World War II]] the [[Admiralty]] requisitioned salvage vessels and most were put under Risdon Beazley's management. By 1945 Risdon Beazley were operating 61 vessels, including 29 that were owned by the Admiralty, working as far east as [[Colombo]]. They lost three vessels and a barge in the war. The other managers operated less than 20 vessels between them. 

Risdon Beazley managed all but three of the salvage vessels that went to France for [[D-Day]]; their ships went on to clear ports in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. The vessels were civilian manned. Usually the only military people aboard were [[Defensively Equipped Merchant Ship|DEMS]] gunners and a salvage officer. The company built 22 [[Fairmile Marine|Fairmile]] [[Fairmile C motor gun boat|Motor Gun Boats]] and [[Fairmile D motor torpedo boat|Motor Torpedo Boats]]; they were the fastest UK yard to turn out the D type MTB and fourth fastest in the UK for all Fairmiles. They also built ten harbour Service [[Launch (boat)|launch]]es. 

At the end of the war they retained the self-propelled [[Hopper barge|hoppers]] ''Foremost 17'' and ''Foremost 18'' and the Coastal Salvage vessels ''Lifeline'' and ''Help''. They spent several successful years in rescue towage using the [[salvage tug]] ''Twyford'' (ex-''Warden'') and the ''Ashford'' (ex-''Empire Sandy''). Twenty other vessels joined and left the fleet in the years immediately after the war. Later the [[landing craft]] ''Topmast 16'', ''18'' and ''20'' were rebuilt for salvage work; ''Topmast 16'' and ''Lifeline'' maintained emergency [[Mooring (watercraft)|moorings]] around the UK coast. The fleet included the smaller ''Topmast 17'' (an ex Inshore [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]) and the ''Queen Mother'' (an ex-Bristol Channel Pilot [[Cutter (ship)|cutter]]).

==Post war activities==
RB found his niche in cargo recovery, which had been the preserve of the Italian Company SORIMA before the war. Treasury figures show that over four years in the 1950s they contributed £187,000 to the [[Exchequer]] as a result of this work. The new recovery vessels ''Twyford'' and ''Droxford'' were delivered in the 1950s. The cost of the ''Droxford'' was £406,000, the Treasury contributed £25,000. They recovered 56,000 tons of [[Ferrous and non-ferrous metals|non-ferrous metals]] from depths down to 300 meters, working worldwide. 

In the sixties Risdon Beazley had co-operated with Ulrich Harms of [[Hamburg]]. A notable joint operation was to salvage [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s ship {{SS|Great Britain}} from the [[Falkland Islands]] and redeliver it to Bristol. 

Beazley sold his interests to Ulrich Harms between 1969 and 1971. In 1972 Harms sold the companies to Smit Tak of Rotterdam. Initially Risdon Beazley Marine Ltd. expanded with the purchase of the floating cranes ''Brunel'' and ''Telford'', plus the 5,000 BHP ''Seaford'' and pontoons.

By the late 1970s, the fleet was run down, and the company closed in 1981.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2406">A '''statistical business register''' (SBR) plays a central part in a system of official economic statistics at a [[national statistics office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/coded_files/RITZEN_Jean_SBR.pdf|title=Statistical Business Register: Content, place and role in Economic Statistics.|last=Ritzen|first=Jean|date=|website=|publisher=Statistics Netherlands|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[company register]] has a different purpose: protection, accountability and control of legal entities.

== Register contents ==

=== Data sources ===

Countries use whatever data sources they seem relevant. E.g. they often integrate a [[company register]] in one form or another.

=== Type of business units ===
In EU a corresponding regulation define register contents:

* all enterprises carrying on [[Types of business entity|economic activities]] contributing to the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), and their local units
* the legal units of which those enterprises consist
* enterprise groups

=== Characteristics ===

* identification properties
** identification number
** name
** address
** contact info
** VAT number
* dates of creation/liquidation
* main activity
* operational status
* legal form
* links to other registries
* links to other organizations or structural units
* control
* ownership
* employees

== Business registries in the world ==

[[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] provides Guidelines on Statistical Business Registers which describes the roles of the statistical business register.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unece.org:8080/index.php?id=40574&amp;L=0|title=Guidelines on Statistical Business Registers|last=|first=|date=|website=Guidelines on Statistical Business Registers|publisher=UNECE|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World''''' is a [[nonfiction]] [[social sciences]] and [[sociology]] book by sociologist Paul H. Ray and [[psychologist]] Sherry Ruth Anderson (born 1942),&lt;ref name="Ray-Anderson 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Who'sWhoAmWomen 19th ed. 1995" /&gt; The authors introduced the term "Cultural Creatives" to describe a large segment in [[Western world|Western society]] who since about 1985 have developed beyond the standard [[paradigm]] of [[Modernism|modernists]] or [[Progressivism|progressives]] versus [[tradition]]alists or [[Conservatism|conservatives]]. Ray and Anderson claim to have found 50 million adult Americans (slightly over one quarter of the adult population) can now be identified as belonging to this group. They estimated an additional 80–90 million "Cultural Creatives" exist in Europe as of 2000.

== Two types ==

Ray and Anderson divide "Cultural Creatives" into two subdivisions:

=== Core "Cultural Creatives" ===

Just under half of the CC population comprises the more educated, leading-edge thinkers. This includes many writers, artists, musicians, psychotherapists, alternative health care providers and other professionals. They combine a serious focus on their [[spirituality]] with a strong passion for [[social activism]].

=== Green "Cultural Creatives" ===

The more secular and extroverted wing of the "Cultural Creatives". They tend to follow the opinions of the core group and have more conventional religious outlooks. Their [[world view]]s less thought-out than the core group and less intensely held.

== Characteristics ==

Ray and Anderson created a questionnaire to identify "Cultural Creatives" in Western society. The characteristics below were identified as qualities of a "Cultural Creative". Agreement with 10 or more indicates status as a "Cultural Creative".

* love of [[nature]] and deep caring about its preservation, and its natural balance.
* strong awareness of the planet-wide issues like [[climate change and poverty]] and a desire to see more action on them
* being active themselves 
* willingness to pay higher [[tax]]es or spend more money for goods if that money went to improving the [[natural environment|environment]]
* emphasize the importance of developing and maintaining [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s
* emphasize the importance of [[altruism|helping]] others and developing their unique gifts
* [[Volunteering|volunteer]] with one or more good causes
* intense interest in spiritual and psychological development (personal growth)
* see spirituality as an important aspect of life, but worry about religious [[fundamentalism]]
* desire [[Gender equality|equality]] for women and men in business, life and politics
* concern and support of the well-being of all women and children
* support spending more money on [[education]], community development programs, and the support of a more ecologically [[sustainable]] future
* unhappy with the [[Left-wing politics|left]] and [[Right-wing politics|right]] in politics
* [[optimism]] towards the future
* involved in creating a new and better way of [[life]]
* concerned with [[big business]] and the means they use to generate profits, including destroying the environment and exploiting poorer countries
* unlikely to overspend or be heavily in [[debt]]
* dislike the emphasis of modern cultures on "making it" and "success", on consuming and making [[money]]
* like people, places and things that are different or exotic

== Values ==

Ray and Anderson assert "values are the best single predictor of real behavior". The list below outlines the values dictating a "Cultural Creative"'s behavior:

* Authenticity, actions consistent with words and beliefs
* Engaged action and whole systems learning; seeing the world as interwoven and connected
* Idealism and activism
* Globalism and ecology
* The growing cultural significance of women

Core "Cultural Creatives" also value altruism, self-actualization, and spirituality.

== In business ==

The concept of "innerpreneurs" to denote persons who create a business that focuses mainly on their own inner goals and development was first introduced by Rebecca Maddox in her 1996 book ''Inc. Your Dreams''&lt;ref name="Maddox 1996" /&gt; The "innerpreneurs" concept is also central to Ron Rentel's 2008 book ''Karma Queens, Geek Gods and Innerpreneurs'', in which he identified the "Cultural Creative" subculture in entrepreneurship. Rentel named entrepreneurial "Cultural Creatives", "innerpreneurs". "Innerpreneurs" have the defining characteristics of an entrepreneur:

* high need for achievement
* high need for independence
* low need for conformity
* internal focus of control
* love of ambiguity
* propensity for risk-taking
* obsession with opportunity

But while entrepreneurs use their business for monetary gain, "innerpreneurs" use their business to find personal fulfillment (creatively, spiritually, emotionally) and create social change.

In 2008, there was much discussion in the Western media on the ‘creative economy’ and the importance of the ‘[[creative class]]’. [[Richard Florida]] published a series of books on this identified 'creative class' and their upcoming economic importance. [[Bill Gates]] spoke at the World Economic Forum 2008 on the need for ‘creative capitalism’ as a solution to the world’s problems. They theorize that being creative and inventive will be the key to business success in the 21st century and that a country’s economic success will be determined by its capitalists' ability to mobilize, attract and retain human creative talent.  See Douglas Rushkoff for an update on how this evolved.

== Use of the term ''integral'' ==

Ray gives the term "Integral Culture" to the growing subculture.  He also refers to this as [[transmodernism]], which he refers to as the "Cultural Creatives". They are concerned with [[ecological sustainability]] and in the case of a core group have a commitment to personal and spiritual development. These are individuals who can meld the best of [[tradition]]alism and [[modernism]] to create a new synthesis, having a cognitive style based on synthesizing varied information from many sources into a big picture.&lt;ref name="ConsciousChoice 1999 Jan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ray-Anderson 2001" /&gt;  This term can also apply to [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)|integral theory]], a conceptual framework expounded by [[Ken Wilber]].

[[File:Thomas_Callender.jpg|thumb|Sir Thomas Callender]]

'''Sir Thomas Octavius Callender''' (born 9 April 1855 at Clydeview, [[Partick, Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]]; died on 2 December 1938 at Bidborough Court near [[Tunbridge Wells]], Kent) was an engineer and businessman, who promoted the electrical industry.

== Life ==

Thomas Callender was the eldest of the ten children of [[William Ormiston Callender]] of [[Bournemouth]] (1827–1908), a commission merchant, and his wife, Jean, née Marshall, the daughter of a Greenock tanner. He went to school at [[Greenock]], in London and later at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]], he had to leave France and later he joined his father's company in London, where he focussed on the asphalt, paving, and bitumen refining business, which his father had set-up. Thomas Callender and his brother founded, in 1877, together with their father, who had acquired an interest in part  in the import of bitumen from Trinidad for road-making and other waterproofing purposes - [[Pitch Lake]]. The offices were located at 150 Leadenhall Street, London, with a small refinery at Millwall, where the bitumen was landed. Large amounts of bitumen were refined and used for road-making and building purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v142/n3607/abs/1421066a0.html Obituary: Sir Thomas Callender.] Nature 142, 1066–1066 (17 December 1938), doi:10.1038/1421066a0&lt;/ref&gt; Callender ensured that all impurities be removed at source, to reduce transporting costs. The company obtained many overseas road-making contracts.

On a visit to St Petersburg in 1880, Callender was impressed by opera house being lit by [[Yablochkov candle]]s. To exploit the developing market for electric lighting, Callender decided to change the business towards the production of high-current insulated cables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Thomas_Octavius_Callender Thomas_Octavius_Callender]&lt;/ref&gt;

1881 tests on the production of insulated wire with patented vulcanized bitumen began at their new factory at Erith, Kent. 1882 Callender's Bitumen Telegraph and Waterproof Company was formed to finance the development of vulcanized bitumen. In the early 1880s, Callender invented the Callender solid system, where cables were laid in wooden troughs and embedded in bitumen.

Callender was responsible for the management of the Erith works. These supplied cables for the electric lighting of the new law courts in the [[Strand, London|Strand]] of London and for the [[Covent Garden Opera House]] in 1883, as well as mains cables for the growing number of electricity supply companies.

In 1891, the company introduced an underground electric haulage system at the [[Abercanaid]] colliery, [[Merthyr]], and, in the same year, it obtained its first tramways order, which was soon followed by the first electrified underground railway.

In 1896, he set-up his own company, Callender's Cable &amp; Construction Company Limited, which became later [[British Insulated Callender's Cables]] (BICC). Callender's, for example, constructed the [[400 kV Thames Crossing#132 kV Thames Crossing|132 kV crossing of the Thames]] at [[Dagenham]] with overhead cables spanning 3060 feet (932m) between two 487&amp;nbsp;ft (148m) towers, and allowing 250&amp;nbsp;ft (76m) clearance for shipping.&lt;ref&gt;''Power over the Thames'', C. Winchester Ed 1937, Wonders of World Engineering P1321-1324, Amalgamated Press, London&lt;/ref&gt; With Callender as managing director, a position he kept until his death, the company was well placed to exploit the quick expansion in the application of electricity.

From 1904, significant cabling projects were conducted in India, for electricity supply and tramways. India was one of Callenders' most important markets; Callender stayed in close contact with important operations wherever possible; thus he proposed setting up permanent offices in India. Around 1902, the company provided the electrification of the metropolitan tramways in London, a seven-year contract, which was completed in 1909.

In 1913, the [[General Post Office]] began to order large amounts of telephone cables. In 1918, Thomas Callender was knighted. When the [[Vickers]] group was reorganised in 1929, Callendar obtained their shares in W. T. Glover and Co. Some shares later went to W. T. Henleys Telegraph Works Co and British Insulated Cables.

In 1930, he began discussions with the directors of British Insulated Cables on prospects for closer co-operation between the two companies, which eventually merged in 1945. He was a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, and a director of several power companies.

== Honors ==
The steam locomotive ''Sir Tom'' of BICC in Kent, which is now at the [[Threlkeld Quarry and Mining Museum]], is named after him.
