'''Ali Daei''' ({{lang-fa|{{audio|Ali Daei.ogg|علی دایی}}}} {{IPA-fa|ʔæliː dɑːjiː|pron}}; born 21 March 1969) is an [[Iran]]ian former [[Association football|footballer]] and current coach and businessman. Daei currently manages [[Persian Gulf Pro League]] club [[Saipa F.C.|Saipa]] and is the owner and CEO of [[Daei Sport]].

He was a [[captain (association football)|captain]] of the [[Iran national football team]], having played as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]] for clubs such as [[Bayern Munich]] and [[Hertha BSC]], and is the world's [[List of footballers with 50 or more international goals|all-time leading goalscorer]] in men's international matches.

From June 2007 until 2013, Daei was a member of the [[FIFA]] Football Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/bodies/standingcommittees/committee=1882038.html|title=FIFA Football Committee|work=fifa.com|accessdate=30 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fararu.com/fa/news/146067/%D8%AD%D8%B0%D9%81-%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%B9%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%DA%A9%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%AA%D9%87-%D9%81%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%81%DB%8C%D9%81%D8%A7 | script-title=fa:حذف نام علی دایی از کمیته فوتبال فیفا  | language = Persian | publisher = fararu.com | accessdate = 17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Daei was appointed as a [[List of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors|UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=UNICEF appoints Daei GMCJ goodwill harbinger|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/01/sep/1018.html|date=1 September 2001|access-date=29 June 2018|via=Payvand News|work=IRNA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===Early years===
Daei was born in [[Ardabil]], Iran and is an [[Iranian Azerbaijanis|Iranian Azerbaijani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vatan.org.ru/publ/velikie_azerbajdzhanskie_sportsmeny/ali_daei/20-1-0-134 |script-title=ru:Али Даеи на |language=Russian |publisher=vatan.org.ru |date= |accessdate=17 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129063318/http://vatan.org.ru/publ/velikie_azerbajdzhanskie_sportsmeny/ali_daei/20-1-0-134 |archivedate=29 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.yandex.ru/people/daei_alya.html | script-title = ru:Али Даеи на новости "Яндекс" | language = Russian | publisher = news.yandex.ru | accessdate = 17 June 2013 | title = Archived copy | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120325124630/http://news.yandex.ru/people/daei_alya.html | archive-date = 25 March 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1news.az/sport/20080613030229643.html |script-title=ru:Азербайджанец на Евро-2008 |language=Russian |publisher=1news.az |date=13 June 2008 |accessdate=17 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103070212/http://1news.az/sport/20080613030229643.html |archivedate=3 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://en.trend.az/news/society/1560991.html | title = Footballer of Azerbaijani origin ranks first on number of goals | publisher = trend.az | date = 17 October 2009 | accessdate = 22 August 2013 | first = T. | last = Jafarov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.az/articles/64053 |title=Iranian footballer of Azerbaijani descent among best scorers of 21st century |publisher=news.az |date=10 July 2012 |accessdate=22 August 2013 |first= |last= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101133724/http://www.news.az/articles/64053 |archivedate=1 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{overcite|date=July 2018}} Daei graduated from [[Sharif University of Technology]] in [[Materials Engineering]] (Metallurgical) with a B.Sc. degree. Born in [[Ardabil]], he played for his hometown club, Esteghlal Ardabil, when he was 19. His next club was Taxirani F.C. in [[Tehran]], where he played for one season, before joining another Tehran-based club, [[Bank Tejarat F.C.]]. He stayed four years with Bank Tejarat, scoring 49 goals in 75 games for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.khabaronline.ir/detail/253509/sport/premiere-league | title = علی دایی و مرحوم حجازی در تیم بانک تجارت | language = Persian | website = khabaronline.ir | access-date = 29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daei's fame is attributed mostly to his renowned goal scoring ability. He managed to score frequently for his clubs, although due to the league schedule at the time he did not play many matches per season. His impressive performance at his club finally got results.

===Move to Europe===
After playing for a couple of minor league teams, Taxirani and Bank Tejarat, in 1994 Daei joined one of country's premier squads, [[Persepolis F.C.|Persepolis]] following his impressive performance in [[Asian Cup]] in 1996 as [[Arminia Bielefeld]] joined the [[Bundesliga]], they signed a contract with Daei and his fellow Iranian national teammate [[Karim Bagheri]].

Daei became the first Asian player to feature in a [[UEFA Champions League]] match. Yet at Bayern he found himself low in the pecking order. This coupled with the Iranian national team's scheduling, Daei had found very little time for playing. Daei was unhappy with his position in the club and decided to make a move to [[Hertha BSC]] before the end of his three-year contract, when Bayern won the championship title in the 1999 Bundesliga. He scored his first and second goal in the UEFA Champions League on 21 September 1999 in a group stage match against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], won by Hertha 2–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/champions_league/454002.stm |title=Chelsea crash in Berlin |publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=21 September 1999|accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also scored in a 1-1 draw against [[A.C. Milan]] at the [[San Siro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/history/season=1999/matches/round=1286/match=57140/index.html?iv=true |title=Milan-Hertha |publisher=[[UEFA]]|date=21 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet even at Hertha he was not a hugely important player, since he was only amongst one of the squad's many successful players, who were to fulfill Hertha's Bundesliga and [[UEFA Champions League]] dreams.

===Return to Asia===

Daei was playing in numerous continental friendlies against world class opposition, yet was still unable to maintain a stable position in his club's starting line-up. In 2001, he was not among the top scorers in the Asian Qualifying round and he did not manage to take the team into the World Cup as captain for the first time. He joined the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]] league at 34 years of age, signing a contract with [[Al Shabab Al Arabi Club|Al-Shabab]] as a free agent. In 2003, Daei quit the [[UAE]] team and joined his old team in [[Tehran]], [[Persepolis F.C.|Persepolis]]. Daei moved from Persepolis to [[Saba Battery F.C.|Saba Battery]] on a free transfer for a modest contract of around $300,000.

He spent two years at Saba Battery, scoring 23 goals, winning the [[Hazfi Cup]] and participating in the [[Asian Champions League]]. After [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup 2006]] and the arrival of Saba Battery's new manager, [[Farhad Kazemi]], it was announced that he was no longer needed on the team and his contract would not be renewed. Despite rumours of retirement, he signed for another industry-linked club from Tehran, [[Saipa F.C.|Saipa]], on 1 August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=fa:علي دايي با قراردادي يك ساله به تيم سايپا پيوست |url=http://www.isna.ir/Main/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-763609&amp;Lang=P |publisher=[[Iranian Students' News Agency|ISNA]] |access-date=1 August 2006 |language=Persian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110054512/http://www.isna.ir/Main/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-763609&amp;Lang=P |archivedate=10 January 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 March 2007, Ali Daei was fined $2000 and suspended for four games by the Iranian Football Federation after the incidents in a league game where he delivered a head-butt to the face of [[Sheys Rezaei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ali Daei suspended for 4 games |url=http://www.irankicks.com/newscast/data/fullstory/EEZFkpAElZxnagvgXZ.php |publisher=[[IRNA]] |access-date=7 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928035202/http://www.irankicks.com/newscast/data/fullstory/EEZFkpAElZxnagvgXZ.php |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May 2007, after [[Saipa F.C.|Saipa]] won the [[2006–07 Persian Gulf Cup]] in a match vs [[Mes Kerman F.C.|Mes Kerman]], Daei announced his retirement from playing club football and that he would concentrate on his coaching career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |script-title=fa:علي دايي رسما از فوتبال كناره‌گيري كرد |url=http://isna.ir/Main/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-933074&amp;Lang=P |publisher=[[Iranian Students' News Agency|ISNA]] |accessdate=28 May 2007 |language=Persian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531063159/http://isna.ir/Main/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-933074&amp;Lang=P |archivedate=31 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}{{cite news |title=Ali Daei calls it a day |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21821322-2883,00.html |publisher=[[Herald Sun]] |accessdate=4 June 2007 |date=30 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Daei was called up to join ''[[Team Melli]]'' on 6 June 1993 in an [[ECO Cup]] tournament held in Tehran, where he made his debut for Iran against [[Pakistan national football team|Pakistan]]. He continued his national team appearances and was named the top scorer of the final Asian round of [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification]]s with 4 goals in 5 matches.

Despite criticism, Daei played in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]; the criticisms, however, were directed more at his fitness and the inability of younger players to play a part in the World Cup. From Iranian media calling for his retirement, Ali Daei has always defended his position in ''Team Melli'' and has rejected that he was too old to play for the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iran's Daei denies he is past his best |url=http://www.iransportspress.com/?c=165&amp;a=3306 |agency=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=7 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hamshahrionline.ir/hamnews/1384/840115/news/vrzsh.htm | script-title=fa:دايي هنوز مهاجم اول تيم ملي است | language = Persian | publisher = hamshahrionline.ir | accessdate =21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== College career ==
Daei captained [[Islamic Azad University]] football team in [[2007 World Interuniversity Games]], scoring a hat-trick in the final match against [[University of Osijek]] and winning the gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.isna.ir/news/8607-07247/|title=مسابقه‌هاي قهرماني 2007 دانشجويان جهان - اتريش هت‌تريك «علي دايي» فوتبال دانشجويان ايران را قهرمان كرد دو طلا و يك نقره، حاصل كار نمايندگان كشورمان|language=fa|date=6 October 2007|access-date=29 June 2018|id=8607-07247|work=ISNA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coaching ===
In [[Football at the 2007 Summer Universiade|2007 Summer Universiade]], Daei was in charge as the head coach of the Iran students national team.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://iransportspress.com/iran-line-up-ghana-and-jamaica-friendlies/|title=Ali Daei take charge of Iran Student team|date=16 June 2007|access-date=29 June 2018|work=Iran Sports Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International goals===
{{see also|List of international goals scored by Ali Daei}}
Daei was named the world's top scorer in official international competitions by the [[International Federation of Football History and Statistics]] (IFFHS), having scored 20 goals in competitive matches for Iran in 1996, including his famous 4 goal haul against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] in [[Asian Cup 1996]]. By the end of the 1996 Asian Cup, he had scored 29 goals in 38 appearances for Iran. In the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification|1998 World Cup qualifying]] campaign, he was again on top of the charts, scoring 9 goals in 17 matches for Iran, reaching his impressive record of 38 goals in 52 appearances for his country. He is ranked first in most goals in international matches.

====Century of international goals====
Ali Daei joined the exclusive circle of players with a century of [[cap (football)|caps]]. In a 28 November 2003 [[Asian Cup]] qualifier in [[Tehran]] against [[Lebanon national football team|Lebanon]], he scored his 85th international goal, elevating him past [[Hungary|Hungarian]] legend [[Ferenc Puskás]] to top the [[Top international goal scorers by country|all-time list of scorers in international matches]]. On 17 November 2004, he scored four goals against [[Laos national football team|Laos]] in a [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifier, giving him 102 goals and making him the first male player to score 100 goals in international play. He has 149 caps for [[Iran national football team|Iran]] and is ranked 21st among the [[List of footballers with 100 or more caps|world's most capped players]] list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/century.html | title = Players with 100+ Caps and 30+ International Goals | website = RSSSF | date = 15 March 2017 | access-date = 1 July 2017 | first1 = Roberto | last1 = Mamrud | first2 = Karel | last2 = Stokkermans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching career==

===Saipa===
[[File:Ali Daei - Gostaresh vs. Saba Qom.jpg|thumb|Daei at the game Gostaresh vs Saba Qom]]
On 8 October 2006, upon sudden leave of Saipa's German coach [[Werner Lorant]], he was appointed as the interim coach of Saipa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |script-title=fa:علي دايي : پس از مشورت با بزرگترها مربيگري تيم سايپا را قبول كردم |url=http://www.irna.com/fa/news/view/line-13/8507178156184133.htm |publisher=[[IRNA]] |accessdate=9 October 2006 | language = Persian |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926221507/http://www.irna.com/fa/news/view/line-13/8507178156184133.htm  |archivedate = 26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later officially announced as the full-time head coach. On 28 May, Saipa became the Persian Gulf Cup champions in Daei's first season at the helm. Going into his second season as manager Daei relinquished his playing duties for the defending champions and found himself on the sidelines full-time. The results of Saipa's [[2007–08 Persian Gulf Cup|2007–2008 campaign]] were not nearly as successful as his team finished 11th in the 18 team [[Iran Pro League]] table. However Daei did lead Saipa to an [[Asian Champions League]] quarterfinal birth before leaving to take over as the [[full-time]] manager of the [[Team Melli|Iranian national football team]].

===Iran national football team===
On 2 March 2008 [[IRIFF]] officially appointed Ali Daei as [[Team Melli]]'s new head coach. Despite admitting that his appointment as manager of the Iranian national team was a "surprise",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iwrXVSgjoP_6TIu-cDjO_FEnmvsA |title=Ali Daei 'surprised' by Iran football coach job |accessdate=5 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309011815/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iwrXVSgjoP_6TIu-cDjO_FEnmvsA |archivedate=9 March 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Daei refused to leave his current coaching job at [[Saipa F.C.]], therefore taking on dual managerial careers until after Saipa had entered the Asian Champion League quarterfinals, after which Daei left Saipa by mutual consent. While Daei guided Iran to a respectable 16–6–3 mark, his third loss on 28 March 2009 to a [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabian team]] that was down 1–0 to Iran in Tehran proved to be the final straw. During his tenure as the National Team coach, the Iranian team managed the weakest World Cup Qualification results in its history with only one win out of 5 WCQ games. After the loss in the 2010 World Cup Qualifier, Daei was fired as head coach after the match. While introducing many new players such as [[Gholamreza Rezaei]], and [[Ehsan Hajysafi]], Daei's squad was often in flux as to who would be invited to a fixture. As well, many critics pointed towards the failures of Daei's team to score and an unsolved weakness in the central defense as causes for his downfall.

===Persepolis===
[[File:Ali Daei coaching.jpg|thumb|left|Daei coaching Persepolis in match against [[Naft Tehran F.C.|Naft Tehran]], 23 August 2013]]
In 2009, Daei turned down a job offer as manager of [[Rah Ahan F.C.|Rah Ahan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.persianleague.com/index.php/the-news/1-latest-news/4771-daei-says-no-to-rah-ahan | title = Daei says no to Rah Ahan | accessdate =13 February 2011 | date = 15 April 2009| publisher = persianleague.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was widely believed that Daei could be next in-line for the coaching position of [[Persepolis F.C.|Persepolis]] but the club chose [[Zlatko Kranjčar]]. On 28 December 2009 Daei was chosen as coach of Persepolis. At the end of the 2009–10 Season, Persepolis finished fourth in the league but they became [[Hazfi Cup]] champions. In the [[2010 Hazfi Cup Final|Hazfi Cup final]], Persepolis defeated [[Azadegan League]] side [[Gostaresh Foolad F.C.|Gostaresh Foolad Tabriz]] 4–1 on aggregate to qualify for the [[2011 AFC Champions League]]. In the 2010–11 season, Persepolis finished fourth in the league and was eliminated in the [[2011 AFC Champions League group stage|group stage]] of the [[2011 AFC Champions League]] but at the end of the season Persepolis won the [[2010–11 Hazfi Cup]] after defeating rivals Sepahan, Foolad and Malavan. Daei had many people against him while at Persepolis including the chairman [[Habib Kashani]] and after a contention with Kashani, he stated that "I won't work with Kashani Anymore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |  url = http://www.irna.ir/NewsShow.aspx?NID=30431920 | script-title=fa:دايي: جواب خود را قبلا به مسوولان باشگاه داده ام | trans-title = Ali Daei leaves Persepolis |date =  14 June 2011 | accessdate =14 June 2011 | language = Persian | publisher = irna.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 June 2011, Technical committee of Perspolis re-appointed Daei as Persepolis's head coach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.isna.ir/ISNA/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-1791362&amp;Lang=E | title = Iran's Daei remained as Perspolis boss | date = 20 June 2011 | accessdate = 17 July 2011 | publisher = isna.ir | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727235243/http://www.isna.ir/ISNA/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-1791362&amp;Lang=E | archivedate = 27 July 2011 | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but he resigned on 21 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.varzesh3.com/news.do?itemid=46800&amp;title=دايي_شرط_كميته_فني_باشگاه_پرسپوليس_را_رد_كرد | script-title=fa:دايي شرط كميته فني باشگاه پرسپوليس را رد كرد  | publisher = varzesh3.com | language = Persian | date = 21 June 2011 | accessdate =17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technical committee chose [[Hamid Estili]] as Daei's successor on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.varzesh3.com/news.do?itemid=46824&amp;title=استيلي_سرمربي_تيم_فوتبال_پرسپوليس_شد_ |script-title=fa:استيلي سرمربي تيم فوتبال پرسپوليس شد | publisher = varzesh3.com | language = Persian | date = 21 June 2011 | accessdate =17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at Persepolis, Daei brought up many youngsters such as [[Hamidreza Ali Asgari]] and [[Saman Aghazamani]] and other players such as [[Hadi Norouzi]] and [[Maziar Zare]] were chosen for Team Melli thanks to Daei. Despite the fact that many challenges and difficulties such as the leaders of fans and the clubs' Chairman Kashani were in Daei's way, Persepolis was crowned Hazfi Cup Champions for two successive years and the fans themselves always loved and cheered Daei but at the same time they did not cheer for any player. Under the management of Daei, Persepolis won back to back trophies for the first time in 13 seasons.

===Rah Ahan===
On 14 July 2011, Daei signed a one-year contract as head coach of [[Rah Ahan F.C.|Rah Ahan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.varzesh3.com/news.do?itemid=48693&amp; |script-title=fa:علي_‌دايي_سرمربي_راه‌آهن_شد |trans-title=Ali Daei becomes head coach of Rah Ahan |publisher=varzesh3.com |language=Persian |date=14 July 2011 |accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first match as head coach of Rah Ahan, he made a 2–2 draw with [[Zob Ahan F.C.|Zob Ahan]]. In his first season as Rah Ahan's head coach, he led the club to the 11th position.

During the [[2012–13 Iran Pro League|2012–13 season]] Ali Daei used many young players such as [[Mojtaba Shiri (footballer born 1990)|Mojtaba Shiri]] and [[Omid Alishah]], and Rah Ahan finished the season in the 8th place which was the clubs' best finish in the league since 1937. Thanks to Daei's popularity, more people started to watch Rah Ahan's matches, and for the second straight year, Daei was able to beat his former club [[Persepolis F.C.|Persepolis]].

Despite many rumors that Daei will leave Rah Ahan for other clubs such as Persepolis or [[Tractor Sazi F.C.|Tractor Sazi]], he decided to stay with the club "to build a team that can qualify for the [[AFC Champions League]]." However, his contract was terminated on 20 May 2013, making ways for him to become head coach of [[Persepolis F.C.|Persepolis]].

===Return to Persepolis===
[[File:Ali Daei in Persepolis training.jpg|thumb|Daei in Persepolis training]]
On 20 May 2013, he signed a three-year contract to become head coach of [[Persepolis F.C.|Persepolis]] after a long negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.fc-perspolis.com/news_content/main/newsId:10472 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130615192421/http://www1.fc-perspolis.com/news_content/main/newsId:10472 |archive-date=15 June 2013 |script-title=fa:علی دایی سرمربی پرسپولیس شد |trans-title=Official: Ali Daei is head coach of Persepolis |publisher=Persepolis FC |language=Persian |date=20 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=20 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the second time that he signed with Persepolis, he returned to his former side after two seasons. He officially began his work with Persepolis on 1 June 2013. His first match came against [[Tractor Sazi F.C.|Tractor Sazi]], which Persepolis won 1–0 with the goal coming from [[Mehdi Seyed Salehi]]. At the end of his first year at Persepolis, his side finished runners-up, two points less than champions [[Foolad F.C.|Foolad]].

He was sacked on 10 September 2014 after a poor start of [[2014–15 Iran Pro League|2014–15 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.varzesh3.com/news.do?itemid=1171716&amp;title=%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%8A_%D8%A8%D8%B1%DA%A9%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A_%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%8A_%D8%B1%D8%A7_%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%8A%D9%8A%D8%AF_%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%AF  |script-title=fa:سياسي برکناري دايي را تاييد کرد|trans-title=Official: سياسي برکناري دايي را تاييد کرد|language=Persian |date=9 September 2014 |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Saba Qom ===
On 1 July 2015, Daei became head coach of [[Saba Qom F.C.|Saba Qom]], signing a two-year contract. In two seasons with Saba he finished ninth and seventh in the Persian Gulf Pro League. He left Saba a few weeks before the start of the 2016–17 season due to uncertainty in the Saba's ownership situation.

=== Naft Tehran ===
Daei became manager of [[Naft Tehran F.C.|Naft Tehran]] on 5 July 2016 with signing a two-year contract, replacing [[Alireza Mansourian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://naftclub.com/d.asp?id=14259 دایی سرمربی نفت تهران شد] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809221606/http://www.naftclub.com/d.asp?id=14259 |date=9 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isport.ir/fa/content/229361/%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%85%DB%8C-%D8%B9%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C-%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A8%DB%8C-%D9%86%D9%81%D8%AA-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B4%D8%AF رسمی: علی دایی سرمربی نفت تهران شد]&lt;/ref&gt; He led Naft to the [[Hazfi Cup]] title but left the club at the end of the season.

=== Return to Saipa ===
Daei became manager of [[Saipa F.C.|Saipa]] on 14 May 2017, a club that he started his coaching career in 2006 and led them to the league title in 2007.

==Beyond football==

===Personal character===
Asides from his great sportsmanship on the pitch, Daei ran many charitable organisations and used a great deal of his money in support of the less fortunate. Today Daei owns his own football jersey manufacturing company called [[Daei Sport's Wears &amp; Equipments]], making sportswear for [[Iran]] sporting clubs in various fields and league clubs worldwide. His company also made jerseys for the [[Iran national football team|national team]]. He has made very significant charitable donations and has made appearances in charity football matches worldwide (featuring in the World vs. Bosnia match with [[Roberto Baggio]] and other football legends). He also appeared in a [[UNICEF]] commercial with superstar [[David Beckham]] and [[Madeleine Albright]], and has regularly been seen working with the organisation.
He is also very famous for being a "gentleman", the name which was given to him even in Germany where he used to play, because of his moderate behaviour.

Daei featured on 18 July 2007 in ''[[90 Minutes for Mandela]]'', a match between the Africa XI and the Rest of World XI to celebrate the birthday of [[Nelson Mandela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/6295348.stm

===Personal life===
[[File:Ali Daei and his daughter Noura in opening of Ali Daei store.jpg|thumb|Daei with his daughter]]


Daei is a religious person. While he played for Bayern Munich, he refused to hold a glass of beer for [[Erdinger]] advertisement because alcoholic beverages are forbidden in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Iranian hero with eye for goal
|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/iranian-hero-with-eye-for-goal-1.336066|date=7 November 2001|access-date=18 June 2018|work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accident===

The '''American International Toy Fair''' (stylized as '''TOY FAIR''') is an annual toy industry [[trade show]] held in mid-February in New York City's [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]] and at toy showrooms around the city. The event is open to the toy trade only – toy industry professionals, retailers, and press representatives. It is owned and managed by the [[Toy Industry Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toy-tia.org/template.cfm Toy Industry Association] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209031416/http://www.toy-tia.org/Template.cfm |date=February 9, 2006 }} main site&lt;/ref&gt; Toy Fair's promoters describe it as the largest toy trade show in the Western hemisphere.

==History==
Toy Fair began in February 1903. The first event featured less than ten toy companies with [[Lionel Corporation|Lionel]] [[toy train|trains]] among the featured products.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Angela [http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/10/business/fi-toyfair10 It's Not All Child's Play at Toy Fair] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (February 10, 2003). Retrieved September 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; As the event expanded, more space was needed which led to toy companies occupying 200 Fifth Avenue, a [[Fifth Avenue Hotel|former hotel site]], in 1910. By 1925, it was renamed the [[Toy Center|International Toy Center]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Peter [http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/02/23/toy-fair-2004-day-one-batman-harry-potter-justice-league TOY FAIR 2004 DAY ONE: BATMAN, HARRY POTTER &amp; JUSTICE LEAGUE] [[IGN]] (February 14, 2004). Retrieved September 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 110th annual Toy Fair, held February 10–13, 2013, attracted more than 1,500 manufacturers, distributors, importers, and sales agents from 30 countries in over {{convert|300000|sqft|m2}} of exhibit space. Nearly 9,500 buyers from 5,000 retail outlets attended. Overall, there were an estimated 30,000 attendees from 92 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toyassociation.org/PressRoom2/News/2013_News/American_International_Toy_Fair___February_10-13__2013___Welcomes_Surge_in_Global_Visitors.aspx#.UeLz1lNOnbQ American International Toy Fair – February 10–13, 2013 – Welcomes Surge in Global Visitors].

The Javits exhibits feature demonstrations and displays in an open trade show setting, while the toy district showrooms allow buyers to consult with sales representatives from the major toy manufacturers in a quieter setting. These showrooms can be found at

Many manufacturers will stage receptions or events prior to the fair itself for invited buyers, media representatives, or dignitaries.

==Attendance==

'''American used vehicle exporting''' is a [[grey import vehicle|grey-market]] [[international trade]] involving the exporting of [[used cars]] from the [[United States]] to international markets.

The most exported cars from the [[United States]] include [[Ford Motor Company]] ([[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln]], [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]]), [[General Motors]], and [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]] (formerly Chrysler) ([[Dodge]], [[Ram Trucks]] (formerly [[Dodge Ram]])), ([[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]), [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Toyota]], [[Nissan]], and other makes. [[Hummer]] is also a sight around the world.

Most exported American used cars can be seen in [[Europe]] (including [[Iceland]]), [[Asia]] ([[Japan]], etc.), [[Oceania]] ([[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], etc.), [[Eurasia]] ([[Russia]] and [[Turkey]]) among other countries. It is difficult to obtain American cars in some countries such as South Africa, where left-hand drive cars have been banned from importation in 2004, as South Africa is a left-side driving country.

'''Andreas Fugger''' (1394, [[Augsburg]] - 1457, Augsburg), known as "der Reiche", was a German businessman. He was the oldest son of Hans Fugger and Elisabeth Gfattermann, making him the elder brother of [[Jakob Fugger the Elder]]. He was the founder of the Fugger vom Reh branch of the [[Fugger]] family. His wife was Barbara Stammler vom Ast (1415/20-1476), a daughter of a rich salesman from Augsburg. Andreas was a very successful and able businessman, so he was called "Andreas der Reiche". He was the first member of the Fugger family who became a businessman. All the other family members were craftsmen at this time. Andreas Fugger and his wife had four sons, Jakob (about 1430-1505), Lukas the Elder (1439-1512), Matthäus (1442-1489/92) and Hans the Elder (1443-1501). They were the founders of the four main lines of the "Fugger vom Reh". The only existent line today is represented by the descendants of Matthäus Fugger. The current patriarch is Markus Fugger von dem Rech (born 1970).

'''Bank Indonesia''' (BI) is the [[central bank]] of [[Indonesia|the Republic of Indonesia]].  [[Perry Warjiyo]] is its current governor.

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Kantoor van de Javasche Bank in Batavia TMnr 60047649.jpg|thumbnail|left|250px|The office of De Javasche Bank in [[History of Jakarta|Batavia]] (old Jakarta), presently the [[Museum Bank Indonesia|Bank Indonesia Museum]].]]
King William I of the Netherlands granted the right to create a bank in the Indies in 1826 which was named "''De Javasche bank''" or "''The Java Bank''". It was founded on 24 January 1828 and later became the circulation bank of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The bank regulated and issued the [[Netherlands Indies gulden]].

In 1881, an office of the Java Bank was opened in Amsterdam. Later followed the opening of an office in New York. By 1930 the bank owned sixteen office branches in the Dutch East-Indies: Bandung, Cirebon, Semarang, Yogyakarta, Surakarta, Surabaja, Malang, Kediri, Banda Aceh, Medan, Padang, Palembang, Banjarmasin, Pontianak, Makassar, and Manado.

The Java Bank was operated as a private bank and individuals as well as industries etc. could get help in the bank’s offices.&lt;ref&gt;Dirk Teeuwen, no date.  ''[http://www.indonesia-dutchcolonialheritage.nl/jakhistoricalsites/Hosp.pdf Javasche Bank, the Old Dutch City Hospital of Batavia-Jakarta and the Mandiri Bank Museum''].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Kantoor van de Javasche Bank in Bandoeng TMnr 60016843.jpg|thumbnail|250px|The branch of De Javasche Bank in [[Bandung]], built in 1918, it is a museum today.]]
Bank Indonesia was founded on 1 July 1953 from the nationalisation of '''''De Javasche Bank''''', three years after the recognition of Indonesia's independence by Netherlands.
&lt;ref&gt;Brief useful notes on the history of Bank Indonesia for various periods since 1953 are on the Bank Indonesia website at "[https://www.bi.go.id/en/tentang-bi/museum/sejarah-bi/bi/Pages/historybi1.aspx History of Bank Indonesia Instituion]".  See also {{cite book | last1 = Cribb | first = Robert | last2 = Kahin | first2 = Audrey | lastauthoramp = yes | title = Historical Dictionary of Indonesia | edition = 2nd | publisher = Scarecrow Press | place = Lanham, MD | year = 2004 | pages = 45–46 | series = Historical dictionaries of Asia, Oceania, and the Middle East | isbn = 978-0-8108-4935-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next 15 years, the Bank of Indonesia carried on commercial activities as well as acting as the nation’s national bank and is in charge in issuing [[Indonesian rupiah]] currency.

This came to an end with the Law No.13/1968 on the Central Bank, which was subsequently replaced by Law No.23/1999, giving the bank independence.

Thereafter, the bank reported to the parliament ([[People's Representative Council|DPR]]) instead of the President, and the bank’s governor was no longer a member of the cabinet.

==Organization==
The bank is led by the board of governors, comprising the governor, a senior deputy governor and at between four and seven deputy governors.

The governor and deputy governors serve a five-year term, and are eligible for re-election for a maximum of two terms. The governor and senior deputy governor are nominated and appointed by the president, with approval from the [[People's Representative Council|DPR]]. Deputy governors are nominated by the governor and appointed by the president, with approval of the DPR. The president has no power to dismiss a member of the board, except when a board member voluntarily resigns, is permanently handicapped, or is proven guilty of criminal offence. The senior deputy governor acts as governor in the case of the latter's office vacancy.

The Board of Governors Meeting is the bank’s highest decision-making forum. It is held at least once a month to decide on general policy on monetary affairs, and at least once a week to evaluate policy implementation or to decide on other strategic and principle policy.

The Bank is active in promoting [[financial inclusion]] policy and is a leading member of the [http://www.afi-global.org Alliance for Financial Inclusion]. It hosted AFI's second annual Global Policy Forum (GPF) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120220161822/http://www.afi-global.org/gpf/gpf-2010] in Bali, Indonesia in 2010. On 14 May 2012 Bank Indonesia announced it would be making specific commitments to financial inclusion under the [[The Maya Declaration#Additional Commitment Pledges|Maya Declaration]].

By 30 December 2013, the bank's microprudential supervision functions will be transferred to [[Financial Services Authority (Indonesia)|Financial Services Authority]] (OJK). In the future, the bank will maintain Indonesian financial system and monetary stability through mixture of monetary and macroprudential instruments and policies.

==Strategic objectives==
The Bank describes its strategic objectives as being
[http://www.bi.go.id/web/en/Tentang+BI/Misi+dan+Visi/]:
# Maintain monetary stability
# Maintain the financial sustainability of the Bank of Indonesia
# Strengthen the effectiveness of monetary management
# Create a sound and effective banking system and financial system stability
# Maintain the security and effectiveness of the payment system
# Increase the effectiveness of Good Governance implementation
# Strengthen the organisation and build highly competent human resources with the support of a knowledge-based work culture
# Integrate the Bank of Indonesia's transformation in line with Bank Indonesia's destination statement of 2008

===National Payment Gateway===
The aim is to integrate all [[Automated Teller Machine]]s in [[ASEAN]] countries, beginning with integration first in each country. On 16 January 2012 interconnection between [[Bank Mandiri]] ATMs and [[Bank Central Asia]] ATMs ([[PRIMA (Indonesia)|Prima ATMs]]) was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wartakota.co.id/detil/berita/70610/Senin-Besok-ATM-Mandiri-Mulai-Koneksi-BCA |title=Senin Besok, ATM Mandiri Mulai Koneksi BCA |date=14 January 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bank Indonesia Liquidity Support===
'''Bank Indonesia Liquidity Support''' is an [[Government of Indonesia|Indonesian government]] policy that was formulated with Bank Indonesia in the crisis period and executed by Bank Indonesia to rescue the [[monetary]] and [[banking system]] as well as the [[Economy of Indonesia|economy]] as a whole. It was partly based on the instruction and command of the [[President of Indonesia|President]] in the limited meeting of economic, finance, and development supervision and production and distribution on 3 September 1997.

This policy was provided under various emergency lending schemes (Fasilitas Diskonto I/Fasdis I, Fasdis II, Fasilitas SBPU, Fasilitas SBPUK, Fasilitas Diskonto Baru and Dana Talangan).

==Offices==
BI operates 37 offices across Indonesia, and four representative offices in [[New York City]], [[London]], [[Tokyo]], [[Singapore]] and [[Beijing]]. In addition, Bank Indonesia also operates a well-appointed museum (''[[Museum Bank Indonesia]]'') which is housed in the former De Javasche Bank head office building in old Jakarta (''[[Kota, Jakarta|Kota]]'').

===Indonesian offices===
Bank Indonesia have branches in almost all major cities of Indonesia.

'''''Black Gold''''' (also known as ''Oil Imperium'') is a [[video game]] of the [[strategy game|strategy]] genre released in 1989 by [[reLINE Software]].

==Summary==
The goal of the game is to promote and sell oil and defeat competitors using a number of fair and unfair strategies. A game move always takes a month, and each action in the game costs one or more days.

The game is designed for four players, either human (using a hot seat method) or computer-controlled. Players take on the management of one of four corporations: "Interoil", "All American", "Transoil" or "Explora Inc."

There are four different game objectives to choose from: to play a three-year game, to survive the longest of all the game companies, to receive an 80% market share or to reach 60 million dollars. There are some game mechanic variations between the missions. For example, when playing to the first 60 million dollars, drilling a borehole takes longer than in the other missions.

There are eight oil-producing regions to choose from where players must acquire licenses, tankers and oil fields: Alaska, North America, Central America, South America, Europe, USSR, the Gulf region and Indochina.

The player can request an expert opinion of an oil field's probable yield before purchase. Once a field has been bought, the player may drill manually or pay game money for automatic drilling. Enemies in the game can disrupt play using sabotage. This can be done by igniting the oil fields, destroying tankers, manipulating balance sheets, etc. To protect against such moves, a player can hire a security company.

In the course of the game there are three action sequences. Oil sales can lead to delays, and the player must manually lay pipeline. Manual drilling requires the player to correct the deviation of the drill head. Finally, burning oil wells must be deleted using dynamite. The latter can be carried out by a specialist called "Ted Redhair" (inspired by the famous [[Red Adair]]).

In employment, a '''blacklist''' or [[blacklisting ]] refers to denying people employment for either political reasons (due to actual or suspected political affiliation), due to a history of [[trade union]] activity, or due to a history of [[whistleblowing]], for example on safety or corruption issues. Blacklisting may be done by states (denying employment in state entities) as well as by private companies.

The first published reference to blacklisting of an employee dates from 1774. This became a significant employment issue in American mining towns and [[company town]]s, where blacklisting could mean a complete loss of livelihood for workers who went on strike.&lt;ref name="Weir2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert E. Weir|title=Workers in America: A Historical Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Feb0w1622soC&amp;pg=PA71|year=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-718-5|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===United States===
The 1901 Report of the [[Industrial Commission]] stated "There was no doubt in the minds of workingmen of the existence of the blacklisting system, though it was practically impossible to obtain evidence of it." It cited a news report that in 1895 a former conductor on the [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]] committed suicide, having been out of work ever since a strike: "Wherever he went the blacklist was ahead of him".&lt;ref name="CommissionMeyer1901"&gt;{{cite book|author1=United States Industrial Commission|author2=Balthasar Henry Meyer|author3=Roswell Cheney McCrea|title=Report of the Industrial Commission on Transportation, including testimony, review and topical digest of evidence, and special reports on railway legislation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3ZMAAAAMAAJ|year=1901|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] of 1933 gave employees the right to organize and bargain collectively. and numerous strikes occurred until the Act was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1935, and organized labor sought relief from employers who had able to blacklist union members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=National Labor Relations Act (1935) (print-friendly version) | website=Welcome to OurDocuments.gov | date=8 March 2017 | url=https://www.ourdocuments.gov/print_friendly.php?flash=false&amp;page=&amp;doc=67&amp;title=National+Labor+Relations+Act+(1935) | accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Though the [[National Labor Relations Act]] of 1935 outlawed punitive blacklists against employees who supported [[trade union]]s or criticised their employers, the practice remained common.&lt;ref name="Weir2013" /&gt; A U.S. Department of Labor and Bureau of Labor Statistics report published in 1938 noted that "Closely related to discrimination and the employer's right to discharge is the blacklist." Employees who had been fired had no recourse to legal action against the employer, but "most States have statutes which make criminal the establishment of a blacklist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Characteristics of Company Unions, 1935|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tYRYPRzLIEC&amp;pg=PA215|year=1938|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|pages=215–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Labor Management Relations Act of 1947|Taft-Hartley Act]] of 1947 made amendments which sustained blacklisting by affirming the right of employers to be anti-union, and by requiring trade union leaders to make loyalty oaths which had the same effect as the Hollywood blacklist.&lt;ref name="Weir2013" /&gt;

====Hollywood blacklist====
{{Main|Hollywood blacklist}}
In American history, one of the most famous examples of blacklisting stemmed from an investigation launched in 1947 by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) into [[Communist]] influence on the motion picture industry. The first in the industry to be blacklisted, as a result of their refusal to provide evidence to HUAC, were a group known as the [[Hollywood blacklist#The Hollywood Ten|Hollywood Ten]], most of them [[screenwriters]], who had at one time or another been members of the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]]. Today, the best known of the Hollywood Ten are the writers [[Ring Lardner, Jr.]] and [[Dalton Trumbo]], who was barred from openly working in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] for over a dozen years as a result of his defiance of HUAC. (He continued to work under [[pseudonyms]] and "fronts" until the revelation in 1960 that he had written the script for ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''.) Actor [[John Garfield]] was one of the more famous Hollywood performers to have been blacklisted by major American film studios as a direct result of HUAC investigations and hearings.

Blacklisting sometimes consisted of [[guilt by association]], as in the case of radio actress [[Madeline Lee Gilford|Madeline Lee]]. Both Lee and her husband, actor [[Jack Gilford]], were blacklisted after it was revealed that Lee had given a party in her house to raise funds for a group later labeled as a [[Communist front]]. Though there was no suspicion that she had ever been involved in any putatively "subversive" political causes (and though her real name was spelled differently), Lee became the target of thousands of protest phone calls to her network. Another actress, [[Camila Ashland]], who appeared on the television show ''Danger'', physically resembled Madeline Lee; though she had no political past, her network too became the target of protest phone calls. Madeline Pierce, a 20-year veteran of radio, who again had no political past, was also ultimately blacklisted.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

====US real estate appraisers====
On October 16, 2008, Capitol West Appraisers filed a class action lawsuit against [[Countrywide Financial]] Corp. (now owned by Bank of America) alleging Countrywide blacklisted appraisers who refused to appraise real estate at inflated prices.&lt;ref name=countrywide&gt;{{citation | url = http://appraisalnewsonline.typepad.com/appraisal_news_for_real_e/files/Capitol_West_vs_Countrywide.pdf | title = Class Action Complaint: Capitol West v. Countrywide| format = PDF | date = 16 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Capitol West v. Countrywide Financial Corp., Capitol West Appraisals alleges Countrywide pressured appraisers to set the value of a property at the selling price rather than setting the value based on an inspection of the property and comparable market prices in the area as required by appraisal standards. Misrepresenting the value of a property allowed Countrywide to lend more money to more buyers at higher risks with less collateral. Countrywide could then make more money off the loans by selling them on secondary markets as mortgage backed securities.

Appraisers who refused to misrepresent property values were put in a "do not use" or "Field Review List" data base, in essence a blacklist. When an appraisal was submitted by an appraiser on the "do not use" database it was flagged for "field review". A field review is a review of the original appraisal. All field reviews were conducted by Landsafe, a subsidiary of Countrywide, who would consistently shoot holes in any appraisal from a blacklisted appraiser. Mortgage Brokers were then required to get a second appraisal from another appraiser. Since independent mortgage brokers did not want to pay for two appraisals and did not know which lender they would ultimately use, and since Countrywide was the biggest home mortgage lender in the U.S., brokers simply would not use anyone on the Field Review List.

As of Aug. 28, 2008, more than 2,000 names were on the Field Review List, Countrywide's blacklist, which it sends to mortgage brokers who hire appraisers across the United States.&lt;ref name=countrywide/&gt;

====UK Blacklisting of trade union members====
{{main|Consulting Association|Employment Relations Act 1999 (Blacklists) Regulations 2010}}
Blacklisting is today illegal in the UK under the [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act]] and the [[Employment Relations Act 1999 (Blacklists) Regulations 2010]].

Trade union members, and workers who raised health and safety and other concerns in the [[United Kingdom]] have been blacklisted by employers. They used the services of the [[Economic League (United Kingdom)|Economic League]], which operated between 1919 and 1993, and [[Consulting Association|The Consulting Association]], which, until it was closed down in February 2009, took over this role within the UK construction industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date=6 March 2009 |url=http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/pressreleases/2009/tca_release_060309.pdf |title=Press release |publisher=Office of the Information Commissioner |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327124346/http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/pressreleases/2009/tca_release_060309.pdf |archivedate=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Minutes – Management Board, 27 April 2009 | date = 27 April 2009 | url = http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/corporate/notices/20090427_management_board_minutes.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = Information Commissioner's Office | page = 5 | quote = 8.8.

The Consulting Association was ordered to stop processing the data. The ICO has put in place a system for individuals to check their information. The Board praised the ICO’s joined up work on this matter. }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] was subsequently criticised for failing to take further punitive action against the employers using the blacklist, or carrying out any further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnplus.co.uk/opinion/leader/damning-ico-misses-the-point-on-blacklisting/8637728.article Damning ICO Misses the Point on Blacklisting] from ''CNPlus.co.uk'' accessed 24 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[Scottish Affairs Select  Committee]] subsequently began calling for evidence in relation to blacklisting,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ee37d03c-1948-11e2-9b3e-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2Be5U2MVn Builders face blacklist damages claims] from ''Financial Times'' accessed 24 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; producing an interim report in March 2013&lt;ref name=interimreport&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Affairs Committee - Ninth Report  Blacklisting in Employment: Interim Report|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmscotaf/1071/107102.htm|website=www.parliament.uk|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a final report in 2015. While acknowledging that some positive steps had been taken, it said "many questions in relation to the practice of blacklisting remain unanswered", and recommended a full [[public inquiry]] as a matter of priority.&lt;ref name=SAC2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Affairs - Seventh Report  Blacklisting in Employment: Final Report|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmscotaf/272/27202.htm|website=www.parliament.uk|publisher=Scottish Affairs Committee|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Norway====
Blacklisting was used in Norway before the Second World War. Well-known blacklisted trade unionists include [[Thorolf Bugge]].

===Eastern Bloc===
In the [[Soviet Union]] and Eastern Bloc, individuals could be [[Wolf ticket (Russia)|blacklisted for political reasons]], particularly to deny them employment in their chosen profession.

{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2013}}

In many countries, a '''blue-collar worker''' is a [[working class]] person who performs [[manual labour|manual labor]]. Blue-collar work may involve skilled or unskilled [[manufacturing]], [[mining]], sanitation, [[Janitor|custodial work]], [[textile industry|textile manufacturing]], [[commercial fishing]], [[food processing]], [[roughneck|oil field]] work, [[Waste management|waste disposal]], and [[recycling]], [[construction]], [[mechanic]], [[Maintenance (technical)|maintenance]], [[warehousing]], technical installation, and many other types of physical work. Blue-collar work often involves something being physically built or maintained.
[[File:Working man-obrero 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A [[manual labor]]er at work in [[Venezuela]].]]
In contrast, the [[white-collar worker]] typically performs work in an office environment and may involve sitting at a computer or desk. A third type of work is a service worker ([[pink collar]]) whose labor is related to customer interaction, entertainment, sales or other service-oriented work. Many occupations blend blue, white, or pink industry categorizations.

Blue-collar work is often paid hourly [[wage|wage-labor]], although some professionals may be paid by the project or salaried.  There is a wide range of payscales for such work depending upon field of specialty and experience.

==Origin of term==
[[File:AlfredPalmerwelder1.jpg|thumb|260px|Welder making boilers for a ship, Combustion Engineering Company. Chattanooga, Tennessee, June 1942. Despite their name, blue-collar workers don't always or typically wear blue shirts.]]

The term ''blue collar'' was first used in reference to trades jobs in 1924, in an [[Alden, Iowa]] newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Wickman, Forrest.  [http://www.slate.com/articles/business/explainer/2012/05/blue_collar_white_collar_why_do_we_use_these_terms_.html "Working Man's Blues:  Why do we call manual laborers blue collar?"] [[Slate.com]], 1 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;   The phrase stems from  the image of manual workers wearing blue [[denim]] or chambray shirts as part of their uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Annette and Mitchell D. Strauss, eds. (2014), ''Ethnic Dress in the United States: A Cultural Encyclopedia'', s.v. "Chambray,"  Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers; UK ed., p. 68. {{ISBN|978-0759121485}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Industrial and manual workers often wear durable canvas or cotton clothing that may be soiled during the course of their work. Navy and light blue colors conceal potential dirt or grease on the worker's clothing, helping him or her to appear cleaner. For the same reason, blue is a popular color for [[boilersuit]]s which protect workers' clothing. Some blue collar workers have uniforms with the name of the business and/or the individual's name embroidered or printed on it.

Historically, the popularity of the color blue among manual laborers contrasts with the popularity of white dress shirts worn by people in office environments. The blue collar/white collar color scheme has [[Social class|socio-economic class]] connotations. However, this distinction has become blurred with the increasing importance of [[skilled labour|skilled labor]], and the relative increase in low-paying white-collar jobs.

==Education requirements==
[[File:PV-Anlage Zugspitze Montage.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Workers constructing a [[photovoltaic system]].]]
Since many blue-collar jobs consist of mainly manual labor, educational requirements for workers are typically lower than those of white-collar workers.  Often, only a high school diploma is required, and many of the skills required for blue-collar jobs will be learned by the employee while working.  In higher level jobs, vocational training or apprenticeships may be required,  and for workers such as electricians and plumbers, state-certification is also necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/bluecollar-worker-whitecollar-worker-11074.html|title=What Is a Blue-Collar Worker and a White-Collar Worker?|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blue collar shift to developing nations==
{{See also|Deindustrialization}}
With the [[information revolution]], [[Western world|Western nations]] have moved towards a service and white collar economy. Many manufacturing jobs have been [[Offshoring|offshored]] to developing nations which pay their workers lower wages. This offshoring has pushed formerly [[agrarian nation]]s to industrialized economies and concurrently decreased the number of blue-collar jobs in developed countries.

In the [[United States]], '''blue collar and service occupations''' generally refer to jobs in precision production, craft, and repair occupations; machine operators and inspectors; transportation and moving occupations; handlers, equipment cleaners, helpers, and laborers.&lt;ref name="uslabor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm|title=BLS Information |date=February 28, 2008|work=Glossary|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Division of Information Services |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Photo by Mona Mijthab, July 2011 (6349812257).jpg|thumb|Women work in a textile industry|Textile factory outside Dhaka, Bangladesh.]]

In the United States, an area known as the [[Rust Belt]] comprising the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], including [[Western New York]] and [[Western Pennsylvania]], has seen its once large manufacturing base shrink significantly.  With the de-industrialization of these areas starting in the mid-1960s cities like [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]; [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]; [[Buffalo, New York]]; [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]; [[Erie, Pennsylvania]]; [[Youngstown, Ohio]]; [[Toledo, Ohio]], [[Rochester, New York]], and [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], have experienced a steady decline of the blue-collar workforce and subsequent population decreases. Due to this economic osmosis, the rust belt has experienced high unemployment, poverty, and urban blight.

==Automation and future==
[[File:Cargo loading, Operation Deep Freeze 2007 070208-N-4868G-323.JPEG|thumb|U.S. Navy sailors load a cargo container onto a container ship.]]

Due to many blue-collar jobs involving manual labor and relatively unskilled workers, automation poses a threat of unemployment for blue-collar workers.  One study from the MIT Technology Review estimates that 83% of jobs that make less than $20 per hour are threatened by automation.  Some examples of technology that threaten workers are self-driving cars and automated cleaning devices, which could place blue-collar workers such as truck drivers or janitors out of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603465/the-relentless-pace-of-automation/|title=Here’s how to use AI to make America great again|last=Rotman|first=David|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have suggested that technological advancement will not lead to blue-collar job unemployment, but rather shifts in the types of work that blue-collar workers currently do.  Some foresee computer coding as becoming the blue-collar job of the future.  Proponents of this idea view coding as a skill that can be learned through vocational training, and suggest that more coders will be needed in a technologically advancing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/02/programming-is-the-new-blue-collar-job/|title=The Next Big Blue-Collar Job Is Coding|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others see future of blue-collar work as humans and computers working together to improve efficiency.  Such jobs would consist of data-tagging and labeling.

==Electoral politics==
Blue-collar workers have played a large role in electoral politics.  In the 2016 United States Presidential election, many attributed Donald Trump's victories in the states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan to blue-collar workers, who overwhelmingly favored Trump over opponent Hillary Clinton.  Amongst white-working class citizens, Trump won 64% of the votes, compared to only 32% for Clinton.  This was the largest margin of victory amongst this group of voters for any presidential candidate since 1980.

Many attributed Trump's success amongst this bloc of voters to his opposition of international trade deals and environmental regulations, two of the largest threats to blue-collar employment.  Opponents of this view believe Trump's success with this bloc had more to do with an anti-immigrant and nationalist platform that supports deportation and discourages investment in higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/white-working-class-trump-cultural-anxiety/525771/|title=It Was Cultural Anxiety That Drove White, Working-Class Voters to Trump|last=Green|first=Emma|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adjective==
[[File:Municipal recycling facilities, Montgomery County, MD. 2007, Credit USEPA (14410405277).jpg|thumb|Workers in a materials recovery ([[recycling]]) facility in [[Montgomery County, Maryland]].]]
"Blue-collar" can be used as an adjective to describe the environment of the blue-collar worker such as a "blue-collar" neighborhood, [[restaurant]], or [[Bar (establishment)|bar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://experts.about.com/e/b/bl/Blue-collar_worker.htm |title=Blue Collar can also describe the environment |accessdate=2006-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708031216/http://experts.about.com/e/b/bl/Blue-collar_worker.htm |archivedate=8 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cathay Drug Company, Inc. (CDCI)''' is a Philippine pharmaceutical company based in [[Makati]].

==History==
Cathay Drug was founded in 1952 by the family of Yao Shiong Shio, a widely known postwar industrialist and president of the Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry in 1974 to 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Flores |first=W.L. |date=2006-05-08 |title=Who will be the next taipans? |url=http://www.philstar.com/business-life/335608/who-will-be-next-taipans |newspaper=Philstar |access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1952 to 2000, Cathay Drug Company has been the exclusive distributor of pharmaceutical and animal health products from American company [[Merck &amp; Co|Merck Co.]], which is known outside the [[United states|United States]] and [[Canada]] as Merck Sharp and Dohme.

==Operations==
The Cathay Drug Company operates exclusively in the [[Philippines]]. Its main area of specialization is the [[marketing]] and [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] of pharmaceutical drugs and products for both humans and animals. The company acquires its products through licensing agreements with domestic and international firms. Among its main suppliers are the following:
* [[Zambon | Zambon SpA]] ([[Italy]])
* Biopharm Chemicals Co. Ltd. ([[Thailand]])
* Aldo Union SpA (Italy)
* Dexa Medica 
* [[Lupin Limited|Lupin Ltd.]]   ([[India]])
* [[Aurobindo Pharma| Aurobindo Pharma Ltd.]] (India)
* [[Ajanta Pharma| Ajanta Pharma Ltd.]] (India)

==Reception==
Cathay Drug is recognized as one of the fastest-growing pharmaceutical companies in the Philippines. In 2012, it was included in the Top 20 Leading Philippine Pharmaceutical Companies based on Value in the Philippine Pharmaceutical Industry Audit &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phap.org.ph/files/downloadables/1_1.pdf |title=Philippine Pharmaceutical Industry Factbook, 8th Edition, August 2012 |publisher=Philippine Pharmaceutical Industry |access-date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for ethical segment by IMS. It was also ranked second among national pharmaceutical companies for ethical segment.

==Symposium==
In a symposium organized by The Cathay Drug Co Inc  and Zambon Italy, four international and two local doctors presented the latest available guidelines in UTI management to local specialists. During the symposium, Dr. George Zhanel of the University of Manitoba (Canada) Faculty of Medicine discussed antibiotic resistance in relation to UTI. Dr. Andrea Novelli of the University Hospital Careggi (Italy) gave an overview of antibiotics therapy. Professor Nicola Petrosillo of Lazzaro Spallanzani (National Institute for Infectious Diseases, Italy) spoke about the stewardship of community and hospital-acquired infections.
Dr. Kurt Naber of the Technical University of Munich (Germany) presented international UTI treatment guidelines. Dr. Ricardo Manalastas, Jr. of the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Medicine tackled UTI in relation to pregnancy and menopause. Dr. Edsel Salvana of the National Institute of Health, UP Manila presented local UTI treatment guidelines.

Introduced at the event was Monurol (Fosfomycin Trometamol), a unique and highly effective treatment positioned as a first line antibiotic treatment for UTI and acute cystitis (inflammation/infection of the urinary bladder). The novelty is its single dose regimen that assures excellent patient compliance. It also has extremely low global antibiotic resistance rates, assuring its effectiveness and the prompt relief of symptoms.
A one-time, one-dose regimen is unique to the drug, as it maintains a very high urinary concentration for more than 72 hours after a single dose. This compares with common antibiotics that must be taken twice a day for seven to 14 days, depending on the severity of the infection.

'''Charles Eugène Bedaux''' (10 October 1886 – 18 February 1944) was a [[France|French]]-born American [[millionaire]] who made his fortune developing and implementing the [[work measurement]] aspect of [[scientific management]], notably the [[Bedaux System]]. Considered one of the most eccentric [[millionaire]]s of the early twentieth century, Bedaux was friends with [[British royalty]] and [[Nazism|Nazis]] alike, and was a [[management consultant]], [[big game hunter]] and [[explorer]].

==Early years==
Charles Bedaux was born in the [[Charenton-le-Pont]] [[commune]] of [[Paris, France]].&lt;ref name=KreisADNB&gt;Steven Kreis, 'Charles E. Bedaux' in ''[[American National Biography]]'' [http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.1000116 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about his early life but his brother Gaston later recorded that in 1903, Charles dropped out of [[Lycée Jean-Baptiste-Say]] in [[Paris]] where he had been studying engineering.

Charles worked a series of menial jobs before befriending Henri Ledoux, a successful [[pimp]] from the infamous [[Quartier Pigalle|Pigalle]] district. The mysterious Ledoux apparently taught Bedaux lessons on proper dress, confidence and street-fighting, but was murdered in 1906.&lt;ref name=Gaston&gt;Gaston Bedaux, ''La Vie Ardente de Charles Bedaux'' (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

What is verified is that in 1906, Charles moved to the United States, where he became a [[United States citizen]], married, and had a son, Charles Emile Bedaux (1909–1993).&lt;ref name=KreisADNB /&gt; He would later claim in interviews to have worked as a restaurant bottle-washer, a [[sandhog]],&lt;ref&gt;'Duke's Guide Here had Vivid Rise; Industrialist Began as Laborer' ''New York Times'', 24 October 1937. [https://www.nytimes.com/1937/10/24/archives/dukes-guide-here-had-vivid-rise-industrialist-began-as-laborer.html ''New York Times'' online archive]&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[New Jersey]] Worsted Mills in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]].&lt;ref name=KreisADNB /&gt;

==The Bedaux B==
Bedaux was one of the leading contributors in the field of [[work measurement]] or ''labor measurement'', one strand of the [[scientific management]] movement's influence. In this, he was strongly influenced by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|F.W. Taylor]]'s book ''Shop Management'',&lt;ref&gt;See F.W. Taylor, ''Shop Management'' (Harper &amp; Brothers, 1911). Online at [https://archive.org/details/shopmanagement01tayl Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; particularly Taylor's time study practices, and [[Charles Edward Knoeppel|Charles E. Knoeppel]]'s writings on industrial layout and routing.&lt;ref name=Brech&gt;[[Edward Francis Leopold Brech]], ''Productivity in Perspective, 1914-1974'' (Bristol: Thoemmes Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weatherburn&gt;Michael R. Weatherburn, 'Scientific Management at Work: the Bedaux System, Management Consulting, and Worker Efficiency in British Industry, 1914-48' (Imperial College PhD thesis, 2014). {{cite web|url= https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/25296 |title=Download PDF from Imperial College, London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The_Bedaux_company_logo,_featuring_the_"B".jpg|thumb|left|The Bedaux company logo, featuring its distinctive "B" unit]]

Building on these authors, Bedaux introduced the concept of rating assessment, which led to improvements in the comparability of employee and departmental efficiency. He named this the "[[Bedaux System|Bedaux System of Human Power Measurement]]." The distinguishing feature of the Bedaux System, which advanced it beyond these earlier scientific management practitioners, was in its use of the ''[[Bedaux Unit]]'' or ''B'', a universal measure for all manual work.&lt;ref name=Brech /&gt;&lt;ref name=Littler&gt;Craig R. Littler, ''Development of the Labour Process in Capitalist Societies:  a Comparative Study of the Transformation of Work Organization in Britain, Japan and the USA'' (London: Heinemann, 1982) [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_development_of_the_labour_process_in.html?id=2k2yAAAAIAAJ entry on Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bedaux also mimicked [[Frank Gilbreth]] by introducing a [[time and motion study|motion study]] [[Kodascope]] package which he propagated with an early Bedaux client, [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]].&lt;ref name=KreisThesis&gt;Steven Kreis, 'The Diffusion of an Idea: A History of Scientific Management in Britain, 1890-1945' (PhD thesis, University of Missouri-Columbia, 1990) [http://www.worldcat.org/title/diffusion-of-an-idea-a-history-of-scientific-management-in-britain-1890-1945/oclc/25526850?referer=di&amp;ht=edition entry on WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management consultancy==
Bedaux became associated with one of Taylor's circle, [[Harrington Emerson]], whose consultancy, [[Emerson Consulting]],&lt;ref&gt;William F. Muhs, 'The Emerson Engineers: A Look at One of the First Management Consulting Firms in the U.S' ''Academy of Management Proceedings'' Vol. 1986, No. 1 (1986).

E. Bedaux Company.

[[File:Bedaux consultancy advertising booklet (1928).jpg|thumb|Bedaux consultancy advertising booklet (1928)]]

Early U.S. clients were in the furniture assembly and rubber sectors of [[Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historygrandrapids.org/article/4349/f-stuart-foote-brings-bedaux-t&lt;/ref&gt; His consultancy's slogan was ''Bedaux Measures Labor'' and its logo incorporated an [[egg timer]] motif.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;

The Bedaux consultancy was one of the first of its kind and within a decade its success allowed for the creation of a string of consultancy firms across the United States, [[Europe]], and eventually throughout [[Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;Jon Lewis, ''Industrialisation and Trade Union Organisation in South Africa, 1924-55: the Rise and Fall of the South African Trades and Labour Council'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; India,&lt;ref&gt;Rajnarayan Chandavarkar, 'Workers' Resistance and the Rationalization of Work in Bombay Between the Wars' in Douglas E.

Major Bedaux clients included [[DuPont]],&lt;ref&gt;John C. Rumm, 'Scientific Management and Industrial Engineering at Du Pont' in ''A Mental Revolution: Scientific Management Since Taylor'' (1992). {{cite web|url= https://ohiostatepress.org/books/Complete%20PDFs/Nelson%20Mental/09.pdf |title=Link }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Imperial Chemical Industries]],&lt;ref name="Link"/&gt; [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company|Anglo-Persian Oil Company (later BP)]],&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Kipping, 'Consultancy and Conflicts: Bedaux at Lukens

==Labor resistance==
The Bedaux system was introduced at [[Campbell's]] in 1927, where ''B'' standards were 'the cause of the majority of the shop floor battles between management and labor' for years.&lt;ref name="Sidorick"/&gt; In 1929, the [[Taylor Society]] supported Southern textile workers in their [[strike action|strike]] against the Bedaux System, which textile workers believed was 'even worse than the old "Taylor Stop-Watch System"'.&lt;ref&gt;Milton Nadworny, ''Scientific Management and the Unions: 1900- 1932. A Historical Analysis'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1955)&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a long series of labor disputes in relation to Bedaux and the [[Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen|Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen (4L)]] in the U.S. Northwest lumber industry from 1931-5.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Egolf, 'Labor Control in Crisis: the 4L and the Bedaux System in the U.S. Northwest Lumber Industry, 1931-1935' (University of British Columbia MA thesis, 1980)  {{cite web|url= https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0094679 |title=Link }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bedaux Hell in the 'Daily Worker'.jpg|thumb|A cartoon attacking the Bedaux B in the Daily Worker]]

Bedaux Britain had several labor issues:  in 1929, there was a strike over the Bedaux System at the [[Rover Company|Rover]] plant in [[Coventry]].&lt;ref&gt;Laura Lee Downs, 'Industrial Decline, Rationalization and Equal Pay: The Bedaux Strike at Rover Automobile Company' ''Social History'' Vol. 15, No. 1 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; In winter 1931-2, women workers struck over the introduction of the Bedaux System at [[Wolsey (clothing)|Wolsey]] in [[Leicester]].&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/work/england/leicester/article_1.shtml 'The Bedaux strike': Oral history study from [[BBC]]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Selina Todd, ''The People: The Rise and Fall of the Working Class'' (London: John Murray, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in 1934 the introduction of the Bedaux System at [[Richard Johnson and Nephew]] in [[Manchester]] precipitated a strike which lasted for months.&lt;ref name=Littler /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mick Jenkins, 'Time and Motion Strike: Manchester 1934-7' ''Our History'' Vol. 60 (Autumn 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the wiredrawers' union took their employers to court over the Bedaux System but eventually lost their case.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;

One of Bedaux's principal engagements in Italy was at the iconic [[Fiat]] plant in [[Turin]], whose founder [[Giovanni Agnelli]] was also head of the Società Italiana Bedaux.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;&lt;ref name=Musso /&gt; These management interventions were later made famous by the founder of the [[Italian Communist Party]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], whose ''[[Prison Notebooks]]'' analyzed the ramifications of ''[[Taylorism]]'' at the plant. The Bedaux System also met with resistance at the Pertusola mines in [[Sardinia]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria Stella Rollandi, ʻIl sistema Bedaux nelle miniere sarde della "Pertusola" (1927-1935)' ''Studi Storici'', No. 26, Vol. 1, (1985), pp. 69-106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.minesofsardinia.com/StoriaMiniereIng.php?IdS=12&amp;IdCSM=9&amp;PHPSESSID=&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bedaux Britain Ltd.==

Of Bedaux's business empire, Bedaux Britain was particularly lucrative.&lt;ref name=KreisADNB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Littler /&gt;&lt;ref name=KreisThesis /&gt; Here, the [[Bedaux Unit]] was so successful that it was copied by industrial firms such as [[Rowntree's]] of [[York]] (a corporate member of the [[Taylor Society]]), [[Mander Brothers]] of [[Wolverhampton]], and influential consultancies including [[Lyndall Urwick|Urwick, Orr &amp; Partners]].&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;

Indeed, Bedaux Britain formed the basis for all four of the 'Big Four' European consultancies in the postwar period: [[Associated Industrial Consultants (AIC)]], [[Lyndall Urwick|Urwick, Orr &amp; Partners (UOP)]], [[Production-Engineering (P-E)]] and [[PA Consulting|PA Consulting (PA)]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Tisdall, ''Agents of Change: The Development and Practice of Management Consultancy'' (London: Heinemann, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Kipping, 'Consultancies, Institutions and the Diffusion of Taylorism in Britain, Germany and France, 1920s to 1950s', ''Business History'' (1997) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00076799700000146 PDF from Taylor &amp; Francis online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ferguson, ''The Rise of Management Consulting in Britain'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

In focusing on factory floor and office efficiency issues, the 'Big Four' Bedauxist consultancies were successful across Western Europe until the 1960s, when they were largely overtaken by U.S. consultancies such as [[McKinsey &amp; Company]], whose efforts were in higher-value activities such as strategy and restructuring.&lt;ref name=mckenna&gt;'Christopher D.

==The Bedaux Canadian Sub-Arctic Expedition==
The [[Bedaux Expedition|Bedaux Canadian Sub-Arctic Expedition]] was the grand title Bedaux gave to the expedition he formed to cross the wilderness of Northern [[British Columbia]], Canada in 1934. Mostly, the expedition was a [[publicity stunt]], but it was also formed to test out the new [[Citroën]] [[half-track]] cars that were being developed by Bedaux's friend [[André Citroën]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Saskatoon Sun |title=Rumours surround legendary Bedaux trek |url=http://www.wdm.ca/wdmbedau.html |accessdate=2007-07-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928072236/http://www.wdm.ca/wdmbedau.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historygrandrapids.org/article/4356/bedaux-canadian-subartic-exped&lt;/ref&gt;
Key points in the trip were filmed by [[Academy Award]] winning cinematographer from [[Hollywood]], [[Floyd Crosby]], who would later be praised for his work on ''[[High Noon]]''. Also along for the trip were several dozen [[Alberta]] [[cowboy]]s and a large film crew.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Sherwood, ''Bannock and Beans: A Cowboy's Account of the Bedaux Expedition'' (2009) [http://surveyingbc.ca/bann.htm summary]&lt;/ref&gt; To map the route of the expedition, the Canadian government sent along two geographers, [[Frank Swannell]] and Ernest Lemarque. The expedition started off at [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] on 6 July 1934 and their goal was to travel 1500 miles to [[Telegraph Creek, British Columbia]]. Much of the trip would have to be made through regions that were relatively uncharted and had no trails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bob Dyke |title=Bedaux Expedition |url=http://www.fsj.nlc.bc.ca/nlc/sroe/bob_dyke.htm |accessdate=2007-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214225117/http://www.fsj.nlc.bc.ca/nlc/sroe/bob_dyke.htm |archivedate=December 14, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The party failed to reach their destination and the original movie was never made, but in 1995, [[Canadians|Canadian]] director, George Ungar,&lt;ref&gt;'[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0881089/ George Ungar on [[IMDB]]]&lt;/ref&gt; produced a television biography of Bedaux incorporating Crosby's footage of the expedition, ''[[The Champagne Safari]]'' (1995).&lt;ref&gt;'[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112657/ ''The Champagne Safari'' (1995) on [[IMDB]] entry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vettese |first1=Richard |title=Champagne Safari |url=http://www.historygrandrapids.org/article/4358/champagne-safari |website=History Grand Rapids.org by the Grand Rapids Historical Commission |publisher=Grand Rapids Community Media Center |accessdate=8 August 2018 |location=[[Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]], US |language=en-us |date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ChateauCandé-B.jpg|thumb|left|Charles Bedaux hosted the Windsors' wedding in his [[Château de Candé]].]]

==The Duke and Duchess of Windsor==
Bedaux purchased the sixteenth-century [[Château de Candé]], in France, and lived there with his American second wife, the former Fern Lombard (1892–1972), a daughter of lawyer James Lombard of Grand Rapids, Michigan.&lt;ref name=KreisADNB /&gt; The couple purchased the château in 1927 and renovated it, completing work in 1930.&lt;ref name="experienceloire.com"&gt;http://www.experienceloire.com/chateau-de-cande.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 June 1937, Charles and Fern Bedaux hosted the wedding of [[Wallis, The Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Warfield]] and [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor]] at the château.&lt;ref name=KreisADNB /&gt; Bedaux then arranged the couple's honeymoon to the [[Third Reich]], where they publicly met the [[Führer]], [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref name=KreisADNB /&gt;

==The Duke and Duchess's U.S.A. tour==
The next stage of the trip, the United States, was called off due to [[labor union]], press and public outrage at Bedaux's involvement. He was quickly [[demonized]] in the media around the globe. Specifically, the [[Baltimore Federation of Labor]] publicly attacked the 'emissaries of dictatorships or uniformed sentimentalists' and called the [[Bedaux System]] a 'vicious adaptation of the [[Taylor System]]'.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;

From then on, commentators conceptually linked Bedaux and his ''B'' system with [[fascism]], and Taylor's remaining supporters, particularly those in the [[Taylor Society]], distanced themselves from Bedaux.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;

The fiasco prompted many employers using the Bedaux System, and those derived from it, to change its terminology to more neutral and administrative language.&lt;ref name=KreisADNB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sidorick"/&gt; This goes some way to explain why historical research into the enduring influence of the Bedaux System and its [[Bedaux Unit]] has been reported as difficult to undertake.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig R. Littler, 'The Bureaucratization of the Shop-Floor: the Development of Modern Work Systems' (PhD thesis, London School of Economics, 1980), Vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War activity==
When Paris was occupied by the [[Germans]] during [[World War II]], Bedaux became acquainted with leading Nazi and [[Vichy France|Vichy]] figures. After the fall of France in 1940, he was appointed as an economic advisor to Vichy and the [[Reich]].

Bedaux's wife, Fern, and her sister, Eve Duez (Mme Louis S Duez), were interned briefly in Paris during the war but were soon released through their connections to the German government in France.&lt;ref&gt;"My attention was drawn to a woman who was sitting on the edge of a cot with an ermine wrap around her feet. She was passing around a five-pound box of chocolates to her friends. I learned that she was Mrs. Charles Bedaux, at whose chateau the Duke of Windsor married Mrs. Simpson. Mrs. Bedaux said in a very loud voice that she did not expect to be with us long, and that she was waiting for Otto Abetz, Nazi fifth columnist in France before the war and the new Nazi Ambassador to France, to come and get her and her sister released. Next morning a group of French collaborationists, obviously personages high in treachery, arrived with an important German in uniform. They were very respectful to Mrs. Bedaux, helped her pack her things, and out she swept, while the rest of us were enraged at this exhibition of the power of social and political influence." From '' The House Near Paris: An American Woman's Story of Traffic in Patriots'' by Drue Tartière and M R Werner, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1946, page 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Bedaux experimented with a political-economic system of his own invention, ''Equivalism'', in [[Roquefort]], [[Vichy France]]. Recent research has shown that the experiments amounted to tinkering which locals hardly noticed.&lt;ref name=LevantNikitin&gt;Yves Levant &amp; Marc Nikitin, 'Charles Eugène Bedaux (1886–1944): ‘cost killer’ or Utopian Socialist?' ''Accounting, Business &amp; Financial History'' (2009) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09585200902969278 Taylor &amp; Francis online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1941, in France, there was a violent coal strike over the [[Bedaux System]] in the Nord and Pas de Calais in May and June.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Vinen, 'The French Coal Industry during the Occupation' ''The Historical Journal'' Vol. 33, No. 1 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bedaux's German connections were not restricted to Occupied France. In October 1941 he was designated by the sabotage branch of the [[Abwehr]] (Abwehr II) to command a covert mission to [[Persia]] ([[Iran]]) to capture the refinery at [[Abadan]] from his former client, the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]], and protect it from Allied bombardment prior to a planned German military invasion of [[Iraq]] and Persia.&lt;ref&gt;The sheer scale of such an operation would have been enormous, especially since Bedaux contemplated the “sanding-up” (and subsequent “de-sanding”) of not only the Abadan refinery, but also the [[Mosul]] oilfield, as well as the 483&amp;nbsp;km of pipeline between them, not to mention other infrastructure in southwestern Persia. The proposal was indeed first regarded by the Abwehr planners as a “fantastic” plan, and it looked as if it would not gain acceptance. However, Bedaux persisted and succeeded in getting the plan submitted to a panel of experts who, after meticulous examination, pronounced it technically feasible. The scheme was ultimately cancelled by the Abwehr for various reasons. Those that concerned Bedaux himself were: (1) his expertise was confined strictly to his 1938 survey of the refinery, and he knew even less about Persia than the Persians knew about him; (2) Bedaux's age, poor health, lack of military training and experience, lack of petroleum-engineering qualifications, and inability to speak either [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[German language|German]] made him a poor choice as commander; (3) Bedaux's inappropriate, grandiose demands, such as being given the full rank of general.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1942, however, strategic events (e.g. the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] and the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]) had rendered the operation unworkable, and Bedaux was dropped by [[Berlin]]. The countersabotage plan then became obsolete,&lt;ref name="o'sullivan"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Sullivan|first=Adrian|authorlink=Adrian O'Sullivan|title=German Covert Initiatives and British Intelligence in Persia (Iran), 1939-1945 ([[Doctor of Literature and Philosophy|DLitt et Phil]] dissertation)|publisher=UNISA|location=Pretoria|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it looked suspicious when Bedaux was later investigated by the [[FBI]] and [[MI5]].&lt;ref name=Weatherburn/&gt;

Despite Bedaux's cultivation of relationships with various [[Abwehr]] and [[Nazi Party]] officials, declassified [[National Archives and Records Administration]] records indicate that Bedaux did not have dealings with the upper echelons of the Party or with officials of the [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SS Security Service).&lt;ref name=Weatherburn/&gt;&lt;ref name="o'sullivan"/&gt;

==Bedaux's arrest and suicide==
On 13 January 1943 Bedaux was in [[Algeria]] allegedly supervising the construction of a [[Germany|German]] [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] when he and his son were arrested by the Americans. He was kept in custody without charge for a year.&lt;ref name=KreisADNB /&gt; Bedaux was eventually flown to the [[US]], and, awaiting charges of [[trading with the enemy]] and [[treason]], committed [[suicide]] using an [[overdose]] of [[barbiturates]] while in [[FBI]] custody in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref name=KreisADNB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Littler /&gt;&lt;ref name="o'sullivan"/&gt; His death featured prominently in the contemporary media,&lt;ref name=NYTimesMystery&gt;'Bedaux Legendary as Mystery Man' ''New York Times'', 20 February 1944 [https://www.nytimes.com/1944/02/20/archives/bedaux-legendary-as-mystery-man-one-of-group-credited-with.html ''New York Times'' online archive]&lt;/ref&gt; particularly an influential [[The New Yorker|New Yorker]] biographical trilogy by [[Janet Flanner]].&lt;ref name=KreisADNB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;&lt;ref name=Littler /&gt;&lt;ref name=mckenna /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brenda Wineapple]], ''Genêt: A Biography of Janet Flanner'' (1992) [http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/product/Gen%C3%AAt,672627.aspx University of Nebraska Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Here, Flanner attacked the [[Bedaux System]] and [[Bedaux Unit]] as, despite Bedaux's verbose claims to originality, she argued that they did not differ 'much from the old [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] shop-management system of the nineties'.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;

==Posthumous reputation==
The circumstances of Bedaux's death and his posthumous influence remain subjects of research inquiry.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;&lt;ref name=Littler /&gt;&lt;ref name=mckenna /&gt;&lt;ref name="o'sullivan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimesMystery"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://historyguide.org/author1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his contemporary prominence in the media, and in business and consultancy circles, Bedaux did not feature alongside such figures as [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|F.W. Taylor]], [[Hans Renold]] and [[Charles Samuel Myers|Charles Myers]] in the ''[[Making of Scientific Management]]'' trilogy by [[Lyndall Urwick]] and [[Edward Franz Leopold Brech|E.F.L. Brech]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyndall Urwick and E.F.L. Brech, ''The Making of Scientific Management II: Management in British Industry'' (London: Management Publications Trust, 1949) [https://archive.org/details/makingofscientif029853mbp available at Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also not present in Urwick's comprehensive management [[prosopography]] ''The Golden Book of Management''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyndall Urwick]], ''The Golden Book of Management: A Historical Record of the Life and Work of Seventy Pioneers'' (1956)&lt;/ref&gt; It remains controversial as to why.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;&lt;ref name=KreisThesis /&gt;&lt;ref name=mckenna /&gt;

It has also been suggested that, in an attempt to restore Bedaux's reputation, the French government awarded Bedaux a posthumous [[Légion d'honneur]] on the grounds that he had actually hampered the Germans and guarded Jewish property.&lt;ref name=Gaston /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sebba|first=Anne|authorlink=Anne Sebba|year=2011|title=That Woman: the Life of Wallis Simpson, Duchess of Windsor|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=978-0-297-85896-6|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research has been unable to prove the existence of this award.&lt;ref name=LevantNikitin /&gt;

A street in Tours, the Avenue Charles Bedaux, is named after Bedaux.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Avenue+Charles+Bedaux,+37000+Tours,+France/@47.376769,0.6693022,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47fcd5e67856f60b:0x89410e1c46d7c3fd!8m2!3d47.376769!4d0.6714909&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Bedaux (1886-1944) grave.png|thumb|Charles Bedaux (1886-1944) grave]]

The [[Château de Candé]] is open to public visitors and is themed around the Duke and Duchess's 1937 wedding. Many of Bedaux's possessions are on display there.&lt;ref name="experienceloire.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.francetoday.com/travel/travel-features/chateau-de-cande-wedding-wallis-simpson-edward-viii/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bedaux in popular culture==
Bedaux's most famous [[depiction]] in interwar culture was as a crackpot inventor in [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' who presents a 'Beddoes' or 'Billowes' 'Feeding Machine' to Chaplin's employer. The malfunctioning contraption was then demonstrated on a restrained and tormented Chaplin.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro F. Guillén, ''Models of Management: Work, Authority, and Organization in a Comparative Perspective'' (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the 'Bedaux belt' featured in [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Inside the Whale]]'', alongside other items and people, such as [[Hitler]] and [[Stalin]], which Orwell saw as indicative of the dark side of the period.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;

Following his death in 1944, Bedaux features by name in [[Upton Sinclair]]'s 1945 novel [[Dragon Harvest]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=OeQlCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT40&amp;dq=Bedaux+upton+sinclair&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Bedaux%20upton%20sinclair&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Bedaux also appears as a thwarted [[Business process reengineering|efficiency expert]], Monsieur Bedou of Ratio Ltd., in [[Pierre Boulle]]'s ''Sacrilege in Malaya'' (1951).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prrb.ca/issues/prrb-issue06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==
Several [[conspiracy theories]] surround Bedaux's life and death. They usually situate Bedaux as a conduit between the [[Nazi]] and British elites, who facilitated important events in [[World War Two]] such as the [[fall of France]] and the alleged [[murder]] of [[Heinrich Himmler]] by British intelligence operatives.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Allen, ''Hidden Agenda: How the Duke of Windsor Betrayed the Allies'' (London: Macmillan, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Allen, ''The Hitler/Hess Deception: British Intelligence's Best-Kept Secret of the Second World War'' (London: HarperCollins, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Allen, ''Himmler's Secret War: the Covert Peace Negotiations of Heinrich Himmler'' (London: Robson, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  These stories stem both from contemporary [[sensationalist]] media stories following Bedaux's well-publicised suicide&lt;ref name=NYTimesMystery /&gt; and in publications which followed the [[FBI]]'s release of the Bedaux files in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Allen, ''The Crown and the Swastika: Hitler, Hess, and the Duke of Windsor'' (London: Hale, 1983) [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_crown_and_the_swastika.html?id=MZ0gAAAAMAAJ Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Higham, ''Trading with the Enemy: an Exposé of the Nazi-American Money Plot 1933-1949'' (London: Hale, 1983) [http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/682306.Trading_With_The_Enemy Goodreads]&lt;/ref&gt; These claims have been subject to recent investigation.&lt;ref name=Weatherburn /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Haiger, 'Fiction, Facts, and Forgeries: the “Revelations” of Peter and Martin Allen about the History of the Second World War' ''Journal of Intelligence History'' Vol. 6 (2006) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/16161262.2006.10555127 ''Journal of Intelligence History'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C16525&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2005 and 2008 this issue was compounded by the discovery that key elements of Martin Allen's ''Hidden Agenda'' trilogy were based on twenty-nine forgeries located in the [[UK National Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;Ben Fenton, 'Lies And Secrets' ''Financial Times'', 3 May 2008 [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f3a43fbc-18ab-11dd-8c92-0000779fd2ac.html?ft_site=falcon&amp;desktop=true#axzz4DfPdTiIX ''Financial Times'' online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The 29 Fakes Behind a Rewriting of History' ''The Guardian'', 5 May 2008 [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/may/05/nationalarchives.secondworldwar ''The Guardian'' online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Forgeries revealed in the National Archives' ''The Sunday Times'', 4 May 2008 [http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article90536.ece ''The Sunday Times'' online]&lt;/ref&gt; These forged papers explicitly implicated Bedaux high in the elite echelons of the [[Third Reich]]. As part of the police investigation into the case, Allen denied knowledge of the forgeries and 'suggested he was the victim of a conspiracy'.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Fenton, 'Himmler Forgeries in National Archives Case will Stay Unsolved' ''Financial Times'' 3 May 2008 [http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20100309134935/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/371bb7fe-18aa-11dd-8c92-0000779fd2ac.html ''Financial Times'' online]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Okpaleke''' (born March 14, 1983), popularly known as Charles, is a Nigerian health economist, Nightlife tycoon, Nollywood movie producer and businessman. He was born in Onitsha and raised in Lagos, Nigeria, where he studied in his earlier years. Okpaleke worked as a consultant health economist for various governmental and non-governmental organisations including the United Nations and Family Healthcare International before co-founding the Play Entertainment Network in 2008, alongside his brothers Elvis and Jeffrey Okpaleke.

==Early life and career==

Charles Okpaleke was born in Onitsha in Anambra State, [[Nigeria]] to a family of four that would later grow to become a family of eight. His father, Late Julian Chukwuemeka Okpaleke was a retired Assistant Inspector General of Police in the [[Nigeria Police Force]] prior to his death and his mother; Florence Ngozi Okpaleke, remains a legal practitioner in [[Lagos]] Nigeria.

Okpaleke attended [[King's College, Lagos|Kings College]] in Lagos where he graduated in 1999. He then proceeded to the University of Nigeria, Enugu Campus where he studied Medical Laboratory Science until 2005 when he obtained his Bachelor of Sciences degree.  Between 2005 and 2006, Okpaleke landed a Housemanship Programme with the State House Clinic, [[Aso Villa|Aso Rock]], Abuja where he worked as a Medical Laboratory Scientist.

Convinced that his career path would be one in health economics, Okpaleke relocated temporarily to Birmingham, United Kingdom in 2007 to pursue a master's degree in Health Economics and Health Policy. He obtained his MSc in 2007 from the [[University of Birmingham Medical School|University of Birmingham]], United Kingdom and relocated back home to [[Nigeria]] shortly after to focus fully on his chosen career. Upon relocation, Okpaleke was offered a role in Health Economics with Family Healthcare International (FHI) on the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative Nigeria (GHAIN) Project in partnership with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the United States President’s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). He worked on the GHAIN project from 2007 up until 2008 when he decided to include entrepreneurship to his portfolio by cofounding Play Sports Bar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/06/okpaleke-brothers-berth-play-network/|title=Okpaleke Brothers berth ‘Play Network’ - Vanguard News|date=2016-06-18|work=Vanguard News|access-date=2017-06-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Grill with his brothers.

Upon cofounding Play Sports Bar and Grill, Okpaleke decided to continue as a full-time health economist and full-time entrepreneur. This decision led him to join his alma mater, the [[University of Nigeria, Nsukka|University of Nigeria]], Enugu Campus, as a post graduate lecturer in the faculty of Health Sciences and Technology. Okpaleke continued as a lecturer from 2009 up until 2011.

[[File:TheCrossingSweeper.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Crossing Sweeper]]'' by [[William Powell Frith]], 1858.]]

A '''crossing sweeper''' was a person who would sweep a path ahead of people crossing dirty urban streets in exchange for a [[gratuity]]. This practice was an informal occupation among the urban poor, primarily during the 19th century. It was the focus of fairly intense study and commentary, and attitudes toward the presence of crossing sweepers on city streets varied greatly among urban residents, ranging from appreciation for their work to feelings that they were a public nuisance. Crossing sweepers also found their way into 19th-century fiction and artwork, including a novel by [[Charles Dickens]] and a popular painting by [[William Powell Frith]].

==Description==

Crossing sweepers were a common sight on the streets of large cities during much of the 19th century. The predominance of [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s&amp;mdash;and the general uncleanliness of urban streets&amp;mdash;entailed certain difficulties in crossing intersections. For example, the long dresses of many elite women might easily be soiled by horse droppings (among other forms of refuse). Crossing sweepers, by sweeping the pavement ahead of a person crossing the street and creating a path that was referred to as a "broom walk," thus offered a service, particularly to the more affluent.&lt;ref name='CrossingSweeperNuisance'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= |authorlink= | title=The Crossing Sweeper Nuisance | publisher= | url =http://www.victorianweb.org/victorian/periodicals/punch/17.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2010-03-13 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://janeaustensworld.wordpress.com/2007/11/10/crossing-sweepers/|title=Crossing Sweepers|website=Jane Austen's World|accessdate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Bills'&gt;{{citation | first=Mark | last=Bills |authorlink= | title=William Powell Frith's 'The Crossing Sweeper': An Archetypal Image of Mid-Nineteenth Century London | date=May 2004 | url = | journal = [[The Burlington Magazine]] | volume = 147 | number= 1214 | pages =300–307 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his multi-volume work ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]'' (published 1851), English journalist [[Henry Mayhew]] 
referred to mid-19th-century crossing-sweeping as "one of those occupations which are resorted to as an excuse for begging..."&lt;ref name='LondonLabour'&gt;{{cite news | first=Henry | last=Mayhew |authorlink= | title=London Labour and the London Poor, Vol. II | year=2009 | publisher=Cosimo, Inc | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=l-eLNkZR8WQC&amp;pg=PA465&amp;lpg=PA465&amp;dq=%22crossing+sweeping%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xeQznJLMzu&amp;sig=gOCjq0OgyFtD2-icUNj5HRgtjpw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MGWXS_v9AtKWtgerruDkAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22crossing%20sweeping%22&amp;f=false | work = | page =465 | accessdate = 2010-03-13 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crossing sweeping was likely a "last chance" source of income for many and had the advantage of requiring little or no startup capital. Those who worked as sweepers were able to ask for money from passersby without necessarily being viewed solely as beggars, and sweepers who regularly worked the same area likely were viewed more sympathetically by those who lived in the neighborhood, leading at times to more formal "weekly allowances."&lt;ref name='LondonLabour' /&gt; Crossing sweepers may have earned a more substantial income in the early 19th century, prior to the arrival of the [[Horsebus|omnibus]], but by the mid-19th century the returns were generally small, with as little as a [[shilling]] being considered a "good day's earnings" even for the relatively privileged sweepers on London's main thoroughfares.&lt;ref name='Chambers'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= |authorlink= | title=London Crossing-Sweepers | date=1852-05-15 | publisher= | url =http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18898/18898-h/18898-h.htm#LONDON_CROSSING-SWEEPERS | work =Chambers's Edinburgh Journal | pages = | accessdate = 2010-03-13 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew 466&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those who worked as crossing sweepers were the elderly and the disabled or, as one 19th-century observer put it, "cripples, and old men and women, shrivelled like dry wrinkled apples, who are just strong enough to give the public that real convenience..."&lt;ref name='LifeLondon' /&gt;

Children also worked as crossing sweepers, and the occupation was regularly portrayed in the art and literature of the day as the work of an impoverished child, usually a boy.&lt;ref name="Bills 303"&gt;Bills 303.&lt;/ref&gt; Children sweepers would sometimes work individually and at other times in groups.&lt;ref name='Leeds'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= |authorlink= | title=Working Children in Britain | publisher=Leeds City Council | url =http://www.leeds.gov.uk/armleymills/gallery/gallery2.html  | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2010-03-13 | language = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080321105914/http://www.leeds.gov.uk/armleymills/gallery/gallery2.html |archivedate = 2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter situation there was often a designated leader&amp;mdash;sometimes styled as "king"&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew 501.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;and the money was generally shared.&lt;ref name='Leeds' /&gt; Groups of young crossing sweepers could be territorial and would fight others to maintain control of their "turf" if necessary.&lt;ref name='Leeds' /&gt; In mid-19th-century New York City, crossing-sweeping was common among young girls, who had even fewer options for earning an income than did lower-class boys (with occasional prostitution being a notable exception).&lt;ref name='Stansell'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Women, Children, and the Uses of the Streets: Class and Gender Conflict in New York City, 1850-1860|journal=Feminist Studies|year=1982|first=Christine|last=Stansell|volume=8|issue=2|pages=314, 317–318|id= |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some observers chronicled the "types" of crossing sweepers at great length. A piece in ''Chambers's Edinburgh Journal'' in 1852 discussed seven categories of sweepers found on the streets of London&amp;mdash;Professional Sweeper; Morning Sweeper; Occasional Sweeper; Lucus-a-non; Sunday Sweeper; deformed, maimed, and crippled sweepers; and Female Sweepers&amp;mdash;who plied their trade with varying degrees of skill, effort, and financial success.&lt;ref name='Chambers' /&gt; Henry Mayhew differentiated between "casual" and "regular" crossing sweepers, with the former only working certain days of the week and/or varying the location at which they worked while the latter swept at one particular corner almost every day.&lt;ref name='LondonLabour' /&gt; In ''London Labour and the London Poor'' Mayhew discussed "Able-bodied" (divided into "male," "female," and "Irish"), "Afflicted or crippled," and "Juvenile" crossing sweepers, offering in-depth observations from and about actual sweepers with whom he spoke.&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew 467-507.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporaneous attitudes toward crossing sweeping ==

[[Image:PunchCartoon crossing sweeper.jpg|thumb|1853 cartoon in the British magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' showing a crossing sweeper demanding (and being refused) payment from a well-to-do woman.]]

City residents had mixed reactions to crossing sweepers and their presence on urban streets. [[Richard Rowe (writer)|Richard Rowe]] viewed crossing-sweeping as "little better than a make-believe of work, as a pretext for begging, either directly or by suggestion."&lt;ref name='LifeLondon'&gt;{{cite news | first=Richard | last=Rowe |authorlink= | title=Life in the London Streets | year=1881 | publisher= | url =http://www.victorianlondon.org/publications/lifein-9.htm | work = | pages =Chapter 9 | accessdate = 2010-03-13 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowe did not see a problem with "alms-giving" to elderly or disabled crossing sweepers, but overall wanted to see their ranks "thinned considerably - [[viz.]], by the elimination of the adults who are able, and the young who might be trained to do something better..."&lt;ref name='LifeLondon' /&gt; A writer in an 1858 issue of ''Building News'' expressed a similarly negative sentiment when referring to "those juvenile highwayman who, broom in hand, take possessions of our crossings and level black mail upon the public in general, and timid females in particular."&lt;ref name="Bills 303"/&gt;

Others viewed crossing sweepers as legitimate workers who provided a useful service and thus differentiated themselves from more nefarious persons encountered in the streets. An 1864 comment in ''[[The Art Journal]]'' noted that crossing sweepers "are of a different class from the pickpocket and vagrant classes who prowl about to make what prizes fall within their reach."&lt;ref name="Bills 304"&gt;Bills 304.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882 a self-described "Lady Pedestrian" wrote the editors of ''The New York Times'' lamenting recent prohibitions on street sweepers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A few years ago there were many children and men who turned out immediately after a snow-fall, and were daily to be met during the thaw, brushing the crossings as clean as they could. For this small service many foot passengers gladly gave a few small coins, regarding the sweepers not as beggars or vagrants, but as laborers, whose hard and disagreeable work enabled well-shod people to pass neatly on their way. There has, however, been a prohibition of street sweepers...The result is that on Wednesday last...there was not one crossing on which the snow and mud did not come full two inches above the sole of a thick [[gaiter]], and it was entirely impossible to find a single crossing to the opposite side of the avenue which could be trod without sinking to the ankle...let us have the volunteer sweepers back for the comfort of a LADY PEDESTRIAN.&lt;ref name='WhoSweeps'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= |authorlink= | title=Who Sweeps the Crossings? | date=1882-02-13 | publisher= | url =http://bp2.blogger.com/_LCVZWFAEodk/RzYsZAQ-GxI/AAAAAAAAI9I/OG-IY1LpjGQ/s1600-h/untitled.JPG | work =The New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2010-03-13 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some older crossing sweepers suffered abuse from their fellow citizens, at times from children. Rowe described one London man, called "Parson," who was regularly "tormented" by youths of the street. However "the police and the omnibus-men, the newsvendors and the miscellaneous loungers hanging about the inn in front of which Parson's crossing, or rather crossings, stretched, did their best to protect the old fellow, and soundly cuffed his persecutors when they chanced to run their way..."&lt;ref name='LifeLondon' /&gt;

In his detailed account of the lives and work of crossing sweepers, Henry Mayhew concluded that, "taken as a class, 
crossing-sweepers are among the most honest of the London poor. They all tell you that, without a good character and 'the respect of the neighborhood,' there is not a living to be got out of the broom."&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew 466.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature and art ==

The occupation of crossing sweeper received perhaps its most famous literary treatment in Charles Dickens' novel ''[[Bleak House]]'' with the character of Jo, a homeless boy who "fights it out at his crossing among the mud and wheels, the horses, whips, and umbrellas, and gets but a scanty sum..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Charles | last=Dickens |authorlink= | title=Bleak House | year=1853 | publisher= | url =http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext97/blkhs12h.htm#16 | work = | pages =CHAPTER XVI.  Tom–all–Alone's | accessdate = 2010-03-15 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jo has been characterized as "one of the most significant figures" in the novel and as a way for Dickens to address juvenile vagrancy, which was seen as a serious social problem at the time.&lt;ref name='PoorJo'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Poor Jo, Education, and the Problem of Juvenile Delinquency in Dickens' 'Bleak House'|journal=Modern Philology|date= May 1965|first=Trevor|last=Blount|volume=62|issue=4|pages=325-339|id= |url=|format=|doi=10.1086/389707}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2010-03-13--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Dickens described Jo as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;not a genuine foreign-grown savage; he is the ordinary home-made article.  Dirty, ugly, disagreeable to all the senses, in body a common creature of the common streets, only in soul a heathen.  Homely filth begrimes him, homely parasites devour him, homely sores are in him, homely rags are on him; native ignorance, the growth of English soil and climate, sinks his immortal nature lower than the beasts that perish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Charles | last=Dickens |authorlink= | title=Bleak House | year=1853 | publisher= | url =http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext97/blkhs12h.htm#47 | work = | pages =CHAPTER XLVII. Jo's Will | accessdate = 2010-03-14 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One scholar characterized Jo as being "depicted as almost completely bereft of agency, a child swept along by circumstances, made merely to 'move on,'" a member of "a nation that fails to recognize him as one of its citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Class Discourse and Popular Agency in "Bleak House"|journal=Victorian Studies|date=2004|first=Chris R.|last=Vanden Bossche|volume=47|issue=1|pages=7-51|id= |url=|format=|doi=10.1353/vic.2005.0031}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2010-03-14--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Jo was a popular character among readers of the novel which no doubt in part led to the production of a stage adaptation entitled ''Bleak House; or Poor 'Jo. A drama in four acts''.&lt;ref name="Bills 304"/&gt;

[[Image:CrossingSweeperNuisance.jpg|thumb|1856 cartoon from ''Punch'' showing "the crossing sweeper nuisance."]]

A real fourteen-year-old youth named George Ruby who was called to testify at the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] in 1850 is often thought to have been Dickens' inspiration for Jo (who, in the novel, was called to testify before an inquest).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Charles | last=Dickens |authorlink= | title=Bleak House | year=1993 | publisher=Wordsworth Editions | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=1OTbzCGIT2YC&amp;pg=PR27&amp;lpg=PR27&amp;dq=%22George+Ruby%22+Dickens+Bleak+House&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hGEgsmng5f&amp;sig=kGfDfZBblaoPABM8uqm78oKQceQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZXCcS9vjL8T68AbR6pSPDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22George%20Ruby%22%20Dickens%20Bleak%20House&amp;f=false | work = | page =xxvii | accessdate = 2010-03-14 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While not disagreeing with that assessment, Edwin M. Eigner and Joseph I. Fradin have argued that an earlier, literary precedent comes from [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]]'s 1846 novel ''Lucretia'', which also featured a young male crossing sweeper, this one named Beck. Eigner and Fradin suggest that both Jo and Beck are intensely symbolic figures for the two novelists, "the representative orphan of an entire society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bulwer-Lytton and Dickens' Jo|journal=Nineteenth-Century Fiction|date= June 1969|first=Edwin M.|last=Eigner|author2=Joseph I. Fradin|volume=24|issue=1|pages=98–102|id= |url=|format=|doi=10.1525/ncl.1969.24.1.99p0270m}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2010-03-14--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Crossing sweepers were also regularly portrayed in the visual arts, and Mark Bills argues that "from the late eighteenth century, prints of crossing sweepers invariably had a satirical purpose."&lt;ref name="Bills 303"/&gt; [[Robert Sayer]], [[William Marshall Craig]], and [[Thomas Rowlandson]] all created prints of crossing sweepers in the late 18th century or early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bills 303-304.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine frequently printed satirical images of crossing sweepers, depicting "each one [as] a nuisance of modern life."&lt;ref name="Bills 304"/&gt;  An 1856 article in the magazine entitled "The Crossing Sweeper Nuisance" offered nineteen humorous descriptions of different sweepers, including (invented) tales of woe designed to elicit sympathy, for example "a [[Crimean War|Crimean]] soldier, who was flogged and dismissed the army for protecting a female from the insults of his commanding officer."&lt;ref name="Bills 303"/&gt;

A more sympathetic portrayal was William Powell Frith's 1856 painting ''[[The Crossing Sweeper]]'' (pictured at the top of this article), the popularity of which was evinced by a market for painted and engraved replicas of the image.&lt;ref name="Bills 307"&gt;Bills 307.&lt;/ref&gt;  Frith was a friend of Dickens and had painted versions of his characters before, though his model for ''The Crossing Sweeper'' was a real boy.&lt;ref&gt;Bills 304-305.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Frith's autobiography, the crossing sweeper who modelled for his painting attempted to steal Frith's gold pocket watch when the artist went out for lunch.&lt;ref name="Bills 307"/&gt;

Beginning in 1876 the British actress, [[Jennie Lee (stage actor)|Jennie Lee]], made a career out of playing Jo, the crossing-sweeper, in the popular play ''Jo'', a  melodrama John Pringle Burnett based on ''Bleak House''.&lt;ref&gt;Jennie Lee, Veteran Actress, Passes Away. ''Lowell Sun'', May 3, 1930, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Data vault modeling''' is a [[database]] modeling method that is designed to provide long-term historical storage of [[data]] coming in from multiple operational systems. It is also a method of looking at historical data that deals with issues such as auditing, tracing of data, loading speed and resilience to change as well as emphasizing the need to trace where all the data in the database came from. This means that every [[Row (database)|row]] in a data vault must be accompanied by record source and load date attributes, enabling an auditor to trace values back to the source.

Data vault modeling makes no distinction between good and bad data ("bad" meaning not conforming to business rules).&lt;ref&gt;[[#dvsuper|Super Charge your data warehouse]], page 74&lt;/ref&gt; This is summarized in the statement that a data vault stores "a single version of the facts" (also expressed by Dan Linstedt as "all the data, all of the time") as opposed to the practice in other data warehouse methods of storing "a [[single version of the truth]]"&lt;ref&gt;[[#rdamhof1|The next generation EDW]]&lt;/ref&gt; where data that does not conform to the definitions is removed or "cleansed".

The modeling method is designed to be resilient to change in the business environment where the data being stored is coming from, by explicitly separating structural information from descriptive attributes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#dvsuper|Super Charge your data warehouse]], page 21&lt;/ref&gt; Data vault is designed to enable parallel loading as much as possible,&lt;ref&gt;[[#dvsuper|Super Charge your data warehouse]], page 76&lt;/ref&gt; so that very large implementations can scale out without the need for major redesign.

== History and philosophy ==

In [[data warehouse]] modeling there are two well-known competing options for modeling the layer where the data are stored. Either you model according to [[Ralph Kimball]], with conformed dimensions and an enterprise data bus, or you model according to [[Bill Inmon]] with the database [[normal forms|normalized]]. Both techniques have issues when dealing with changes in the systems feeding the data warehouse. For conformed dimensions you also have to cleanse data (to conform it) and this is undesirable in a number of cases since this inevitably will lose information. Data vault is designed to avoid or minimize the impact of those issues, by moving them to areas of the data warehouse that are outside the historical storage area (cleansing is done in the data marts) and by separating the structural items (business keys and the associations between the business keys) from the descriptive attributes.

Dan Linstedt, the creator of the method, describes the resulting database as follows:
{{quotation | "The Data Vault Model is a detail oriented, historical tracking and uniquely linked set of normalized tables that support one or more functional areas of business. It is a hybrid approach encompassing the best of breed between 3rd normal form (3NF) and [[star schema]]. The design is flexible, scalable, consistent and adaptable to the needs of the enterprise"&lt;ref&gt;[[#dved2|The New Business Supermodel]], glossary, page 75&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Data vault's philosophy is that all data is relevant data, even if it is not in line with established definitions and business rules. If data are not conforming to these definitions and rules then that is a problem for the business, not the data warehouse. The determination of data being "wrong" is an interpretation of the data that stems from a particular point of view that may not be valid for everyone, or at every point in time. Therefore the data vault must capture all data and only when reporting or extracting data from the data vault is the data being interpreted.

Another issue to which data vault is a response is that more and more there is a need for complete auditability and traceability of all the data in the data warehouse. Due to [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] requirements in the USA and similar measures in Europe this is a relevant topic for many business intelligence implementations, hence the focus of any data vault implementation is complete traceability and auditability of all information.

''Data Vault 2.0'' is the new specification, it is an [[open standard]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#dvos2|A short intro to#datavault 2.0]]&lt;/ref&gt; The new specification contains components which define the implementation best practices, the methodology (SEI/CMMI, Six Sigma, SDLC, etc..), the architecture, and the model. ''Data Vault 2.0'' has a focus on including new components such as Big Data, NoSQL - and also focuses on performance of the existing model. The old specification (documented here for the most part) is highly focused on data vault modeling.  It is documented in the book: Building a Scalable Data Warehouse with Data Vault 2.0.

It is necessary to evolve the specification to include the new components, along with the best practices in order to keep the EDW and BI systems current with the needs and desires of today's businesses.

=== History ===
Data vault modeling was originally conceived by Dan Linstedt in 1990 and was released in 2000 as a public domain modeling method. In a series of five articles on The Data Administration Newsletter the basic rules of the Data Vault method are expanded and explained. These contain a general overview,&lt;ref&gt;[[#tdan1|Data Vault Series 1 – Data Vault Overview]]&lt;/ref&gt; an overview of the components,&lt;ref&gt;[[#tdan2|Data Vault Series 2 – Data Vault Components]]&lt;/ref&gt; a discussion about end dates and joins,&lt;ref&gt;[[#tdan3|Data Vault Series 3 – End Dates and Basic Joins]]&lt;/ref&gt; link tables,&lt;ref&gt;[[#tdan4|Data Vault Series 4 – Link tables]], paragraph 2.3&lt;/ref&gt; and an article on loading practices.&lt;ref name="DataVault_a"&gt;[[#tdan5|Data Vault Series 5 – Loading Practices]]&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative (and seldom used) name for the method is "Common Foundational Integration Modelling Architecture."&lt;ref&gt;[[#dwdummy|Data Warehousing for Dummies]], page 83&lt;/ref&gt;

''Data Vault 2.0''&lt;ref&gt;[[#dvos2|A short intro to #datavault 2.0]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#dvspec2|Data Vault 2.0 Being Announced]]&lt;/ref&gt; has arrived on the scene as of 2013 and brings to the table Big Data, NoSQL, unstructured, semi-structured seamless integration, along with methodology, architecture, and implementation best practices.

=== Alternative interpretations ===
According to Dan Linstedt, the Data Model is inspired by (or patterned off) a simplistic view of neurons, dendrites, and synapses – where neurons are associated with Hubs and Hub Satellites, Links are dendrites (vectors of information), and other Links are synapses (vectors in the opposite direction). By using a data mining set of algorithms, links can be scored with confidence and strength ratings. They can be created and dropped on the fly in accordance with learning about relationships that currently don't exist. The model can be automatically morphed, adapted, and adjusted as it is used and fed new structures.&lt;ref&gt;[[#dvsuper|Super Charge your Data Warehouse]], paragraph 5.20, page 110&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view is that a data vault model provides an [[ontology]] of the Enterprise in the sense that it describes the terms in the domain of the enterprise (Hubs) and the relationships among them (Links), adding descriptive attributes (Satellites) where necessary.

Another way to think of a data vault model is as a graph model. The data vault model actually provides a "graph based" model with hubs and relationships in a relational database world. In this manner, the developer can use SQL to get at graph based relationships with sub-second responses.

== Basic notions ==

[[File:Data Vault Example.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Simple data vault model with two hubs (blue), one link (green) and four satellites (yellow)]]

Data vault attempts to solve the problem of dealing with change in the environment by separating the business keys (that do not mutate as often, because they uniquely identify a business entity) and the associations between those business keys, from the descriptive attributes of those keys.

The business keys and their associations are structural attributes, forming the skeleton of the data model. The data vault method has as one of its main axioms that real business keys only change when the business changes and are therefore the most stable elements from which to derive the structure of a historical database. If you use these keys as the backbone of a data warehouse, you can organize the rest of the data around them. This means that choosing the correct keys for the hubs is of prime importance for the stability of your model.&lt;ref&gt;[[#dvsuper|Super Charge your data warehouse]], page 61, why are business keys important&lt;/ref&gt; The keys are stored in tables with a few constraints on the structure. These key-tables are called hubs.

=== Hubs ===
Hubs contain a list of unique business keys with low propensity to change. Hubs also contain a surrogate key for each Hub item and metadata describing the origin of the business key. The descriptive attributes for the information on the Hub (such as the description for the key, possibly in multiple languages) are stored in structures called Satellite tables which will be discussed below.

The Hub contains at least the following fields:&lt;ref name="DataVault"&gt;[[#dvforum1|Data Vault Forum, Standards section]], section 3.0 Hub Rules&lt;/ref&gt; 
* a surrogate key, used to connect the other structures to this table. 
* a business key, the driver for this hub. The business key can consist of multiple fields.
* the record source, which can be used to see what system loaded each business key first.
* optionally, you can also have metadata fields with information about manual updates (user/time) and the extraction date.

A hub is not allowed to contain multiple business keys, except when two systems deliver the same business key but with collisions that have different meanings.

Hubs should normally have at least one satellite.&lt;ref name="DataVault" /&gt;

==== Hub example ====
This is an example for a hub-table containing cars, called "Car" (H_CAR). The driving key is [[vehicle identification number]].

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Fieldname !! Description !! Mandatory? || Comment
|-
| H_CAR_ID || Sequence ID and surrogate key for the hub || No || Recommended but optional&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#dvrules1|Data Vault Modeling Specification v1.0.9]]&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| VEHICLE_ID_NR || The business key that drives this hub. Can be more than one field for a composite business key || Yes
|-
| H_RSRC || The recordsource of this key when first loaded || Yes
|-
| LOAD_AUDIT_ID || An ID into a table with audit information, such as load time, duration of load, number of lines, etc. || No
|}

=== Links ===
Associations or transactions between business keys (relating for instance the hubs for customer and product with each other through the purchase transaction) are modeled using link tables. These tables are basically many-to-many join tables, with some metadata.

Links can link to other links, to deal with changes in granularity (for instance, adding a new key to a database table would change the grain of the database table). For instance, if you have an association between customer and address, you could add a reference to a link between the hubs for product and transport company. This could be a link called "Delivery". Referencing a link in another link is considered a bad practice, because it introduces dependencies between links that make parallel loading more difficult. Since a link to another link is the same as a new link with the hubs from the other link, in these cases creating the links without referencing other links is the preferred solution (see the section on loading practices for more information).

Links sometimes link hubs to information that is not by itself enough to construct a hub. This occurs when one of the business keys associated by the link is not a real business key. As an example, take an order form with "order number" as key, and order lines that are keyed with a semi-random number to make them unique. Let's say, "unique number". The latter key is not a real business key, so it is no hub. However, we do need to use it in order to guarantee the correct granularity for the link. In this case, we do not use a hub with surrogate key, but add the business key "unique number" itself to the link. This is done only when there is no possibility of ever using the business key for another link or as key for attributes in a satellite. This construct has been called a 'peg-legged link' by Dan Linstedt on his (now defunct) forum.

Links contain the surrogate keys for the hubs that are linked, their own surrogate key for the link and metadata describing the origin of the association. The descriptive attributes for the information on the association (such as the time, price or amount) are stored in structures called ''satellite tables'' which are discussed below.

==== Link example ====
This is an example for a link-table between two hubs for cars (H_CAR) and persons (H_PERSON). The link is called "Driver" (L_DRIVER).

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Fieldname !! Description !! Mandatory? !! Comment
|-
| L_DRIVER_ID || Sequence ID and surrogate key for the Link || No  || Recommended but optional&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
|-
| H_CAR_ID || surrogate key for the car hub, the first anchor of the link || Yes ||
|-
| H_PERSON_ID || surrogate key for the person hub, the second anchor of the link || Yes ||
|-
| L_RSRC || The recordsource of this association when first loaded || Yes ||
|-
| LOAD_AUDIT_ID || An ID into a table with audit information, such as load time, duration of load, number of lines, etc. || No ||
|}

=== Satellites ===
The hubs and links form the structure of the model, but have no temporal attributes and hold no descriptive attributes. These are stored in separate tables called ''satellites''. These consist of metadata linking them to their parent hub or link, metadata describing the origin of the association and attributes, as well as a timeline with start and end dates for the attribute. Where the hubs and links provide the structure of the model, the satellites provide the "meat" of the model, the context for the business processes that are captured in hubs and links. These attributes are stored both with regards to the details of the matter as well as the timeline and can range from quite complex (all of the fields describing a clients complete profile) to quite simple (a satellite on a link with only a valid-indicator and a timeline).

Usually the attributes are grouped in satellites by source system. However, descriptive attributes such as size, cost, speed, amount or color can change at different rates, so you can also split these attributes up in different satellites based on their rate of change.

All the tables contain metadata, minimally describing at least the source system and the date on which this entry became valid, giving a complete historical view of the data as it enters the data warehouse.

==== Satellite example ====
This is an example for a satellite on the drivers-link between the hubs for cars and persons, called "Driver insurance" (S_DRIVER_INSURANCE). This satellite contains attributes that are specific to the insurance of the relationship between the car and the person driving it, for instance an indicator whether this is the primary driver, the name of the insurance company for this car and person (could also be a separate hub) and a summary of the number of accidents involving this combination of vehicle and driver. Also included is a reference to a lookup- or reference table called R_RISK_CATEGORY containing the codes for the risk category in which this relationship is deemed to fall.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Fieldname !! Description !! Mandatory? || Comment
|-
| S_DRIVER_INSURANCE_ID || Sequence ID and surrogate key for the satellite on the link || No || Recommended but optional&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
|-
| L_DRIVER_ID || (surrogate) primary key for the driver link, the parent of the satellite || Yes
|-
|-
| S_SEQ_NR || Ordering or sequence number, to enforce uniqueness if there are several valid satellites for one parent key || No(**) || This can happen if, for instance, you have a hub COURSE and the name of the course is an attribute but in several different languages. 
|-
| S_LDTS || Load Date (startdate) for the validity of this combination of attribute values for parent key L_DRIVER_ID || Yes
|-
| S_LEDTS || Load End Date (enddate) for the validity of this combination of attribute values for parent key L_DRIVER_ID || No
|-
| IND_PRIMARY_DRIVER || Indicator whether the driver is the primary driver for this car || No (*)
|-
| INSURANCE_COMPANY || The name of the insurance company for this vehicle and this driver || No (*)
|-
| NR_OF_ACCIDENTS || The number of accidents by this driver in this vehicle || No (*)
|-
| R_RISK_CATEGORY_CD || The risk category for the driver. This is a reference to R_RISK_CATEGORY || No (*)
|-
| S_RSRC || The recordsource of the information in this satellite when first loaded || Yes
|-
| LOAD_AUDIT_ID || An ID into a table with audit information, such as load time, duration of load, number of lines, etc. || No
|}

(*) at least one attribute is mandatory.
(**) sequence number becomes mandatory if it is needed to enforce uniqueness for multiple valid satellites on the same hub or link.

=== Reference tables ===
Reference tables are a normal part of a healthy data vault model. They are there to prevent redundant storage of simple reference data that is referenced a lot. More formally, Dan Linstedt defines reference data as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Any information deemed necessary to resolve descriptions from codes, or to translate keys in to (sic) a consistent manner. Many of these fields are "descriptive" in nature and &lt;strong&gt;describe&lt;/strong&gt; a specific state of the other more important information. As such, reference data lives in separate tables from the raw Data Vault tables''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#dvsuper|Super Charge your Data Warehouse]], paragraph 8.0, page 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reference tables are referenced from Satellites, but never bound with physical foreign keys. There is no prescribed structure for reference tables: use what works best in your specific case, ranging from simple lookup tables to small data vaults or even stars. They can be historical or have no history, but it is recommended that you stick to the natural keys and not create surrogate keys in that case.&lt;ref&gt;[[#dvsuper|Super Charge your Data Warehouse]], paragraph 8.0, page 149&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, data vaults have a lot of reference tables, just like any other Data Warehouse.

==== Reference example ====
This is an example of a reference table with risk categories for drivers of vehicles. It can be referenced from any satellite in the data vault. For now we reference it from satellite S_DRIVER_INSURANCE. The reference table is R_RISK_CATEGORY.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Fieldname !! Description !! Mandatory?
|-
| R_RISK_CATEGORY_CD || The code for the risk category || Yes
|-
| RISK_CATEGORY_DESC || A description of the risk category || No (*)
|}

(*) at least one attribute is mandatory.

== Loading practices ==

The [[Extract,_transform,_load|ETL]] for updating a data vault model is fairly straightforward (see [[#tdan5|Data Vault Series 5 – Loading Practices]]). First you have to load all the hubs, creating surrogate IDs for any new business keys. Having done that, you can now resolve all business keys to surrogate ID's if you query the hub. The second step is to resolve the links between hubs and create surrogate IDs for any new associations. At the same time, you can also create all satellites that are attached to hubs, since you can resolve the key to a surrogate ID. Once you have created all the new links with their surrogate keys, you can add the satellites to all the links.

Since the hubs are not joined to each other except through links, you can load all the hubs in parallel. Since links are not attached directly to each other, you can load all the links in parallel as well. Since satellites can be attached only to hubs and links, you can also load these in parallel.

The ETL is quite straightforward and lends itself to easy automation or templating. Problems occur only with links relating to other links, because resolving the business keys in the link only leads to another link that has to be resolved as well. Due to the equivalence of this situation with a link to multiple hubs, this difficulty can be avoided by remodeling such cases and this is in fact the recommended practice.&lt;ref name="DataVault_a" /&gt;

Data are never deleted from the data vault, unless you have a technical error while loading data.

== Data vault and dimensional modelling ==

The data vault modelled layer is normally used to store data. It is not optimized for query performance, nor is it easy to query by the well-known query-tools such as [[Cognos]], [[SAP Business Objects]], [[Pentaho]] et al.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Since these end-user computing tools expect or prefer their data to be contained in a dimensional model, a conversion is usually necessary.

For this purpose, the hubs and related satellites on those hubs can be considered as dimensions and the links and related satellites on those links can be viewed as fact tables in a dimensional model. This enables you to quickly prototype a dimensional model out of a data vault model using views. For performance reasons the dimensional model will usually be implemented in relational tables, after approval.

Note that while it is relatively straightforward to move data from a data vault model to a (cleansed) dimensional model, the reverse is not as easy, given the denormalized nature of the dimensional model's fact tables, fundamentally different to the third normal form of the data vault.

== Data vault methodology ==

The data vault methodology is based on SEI/CMMI Level 5 best practices. It includes multiple components of CMMI Level 5, and combines them with best practices from [[Six Sigma]], [[Total quality management|TQM]], and SDLC. Particularly, it is focused on Scott Ambler's agile methodology for build out and deployment. Data vault projects have a short, scope-controlled release cycle and should consist of a production release every 2 to 3 weeks.

Teams using the data vault methodology should readily adapt to the repeatable, consistent, and measurable projects that are expected at CMMI Level 5. Data that flow through the EDW data vault system will begin to follow the TQM (total quality management) life-cycle that has long been missing from BI (business intelligence) projects.

'''Demand generation''' is the focus of targeted marketing programs to drive awareness and interest in a company's [[Product (business)|product]]s and/or services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coxblue.com/whats-the-difference-between-lead-generation-and-demand-generation/|title=What’s the difference between lead generation and demand generation?|publisher=Cox Blue}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly used in business-to-business, business-to-government, or longer business-to-consumer sales cycles, demand generation involves multiple areas of marketing and is really the marriage of marketing programs coupled with a structured sales process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontargetpartners.com/lead-generation-services/demand-generation-and-discovery/|title=Demand Generation &amp; Discovery|publisher=Cox Blue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple components of a stepped demand generation process that vary based on the size and complexity of a sale.  These components include, among other things: building awareness, positioning relevance, supporting validation and mitigating customer evaluation. Useful demand generation methodologies include [[AIDA (marketing)|AIDA]] (attract Attention, maintain Interest, create Desire, get Action), developed by [[E. St. Elmo Lewis]].

==Building awareness==

Demand generation is a holistic approach to marketing and sales cohesion within the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://marketinginsidergroup.com/demand-generation/responsible-demand-generation-marketing-sales/|title=Who Is Responsible For Demand Generation?

Advanced demand generation programs typically rely on some form of proactive [[Lead Generation]] activities supported by more traditional market programs and processes. This is because demand generation programs tend to assume that prospective customers are aware that they have a need or problem, and are attempting to solve it when they search for solutions.&lt;ref&gt;"Demand Generation Quality vs Quantity" video, http://vimeo.com/99688328, Published 1 July 2014. Retrieved 2 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; If the prospect is unaware (consciously or, at least, subconsciously) that they have the problem, then demand generation may not be effective - thus the need for adjunct lead generation activities.

[[Brand management|Branding]]

[[Inbound marketing]]:
* [[Search engine optimization]]
* [[Viral marketing]]
* [[Social media marketing]]
* [[Pay per click]] marketing

[[Interruption marketing|Outbound Marketing]]:
* Inside sales/[[telemarketing]]
* [[Outsourcing|Outsourced]] [[lead generation]]
* Outsourced appointment setting
* [[Email marketing]]

==Facilitating discovery==

The second key area of focus for a marketer focused on demand generation is ensuring that when a prospect decides to seek a vendor to provide a solution in a given solution category, they discover the vendor that the marketer serves.  This is again accomplished with a variety of techniques and tools, often overlapping with the tools used for creating awareness of the category, but with a different emphasis.

* [[Search advertising|Search engine advertising]] – the purchase of advertisements on search engines to appear when keywords on the specific category, or known competitors in the solution space, are searched for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.searchmetrics.com/glossary/search-engine-advertising/|title=What is Search Engine Advertising|publisher=Searchmetrics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Search engine optimization]] – the use of a variety of techniques to increase a web site’s natural position in [[Web search engine|search engine]] results when keywords on the specific category, or known competitors in the solution space, are searched for&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-seo|title=What is Search Engine Optimization|publisher=Search Engine Land}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webconfs.com/seo-tutorial/introduction-to-seo.php|title=What is SEO?|publisher=Webconfs}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Webinar]]s or [[seminar]]s – online web based seminars, or in person seminars to allow prospective buyers to discover and understand a vendor’s solution, how it can be used, and who else is using it, in detail&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Webinar.html|title=webinar (Web-based seminar)|publisher=Webopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Demonstrations and free trials''' – easily accessed, often online, tools for demonstrating a solution or accessing a time-limited or feature-constrained trial version to assist prospective buyers in discovering the solution and its fit with their need

Again, in this phase of the demand generation process, many approaches and tools are used and this list is only a selection of the more common approaches.

==Guiding solution validation==

Often confused with demand generation is the lead process itself. Converting demand into sales is a totally separate task. Many companies, however, will call themselves demand generation organizations when they are really [[Lead generation|lead generating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leadformix.com/blog/2013/05/demand-generation-vs-lead-generation-tell-them-apart/|title=Demand Generation Vs Lead Generation: Tell Them Apart|date=15 May 2013|publisher=Leadformix Blog|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This later phase of the buying process involves validating that a selected vendor will meet specified requirements, coming to an agreement with the [[vendor]] on costs, contract terms, support and services, and finalizing the purchase process.

This often involves coordinating the involvement of other organizational and extra-organizational resources such as [[Sales|sales representatives]] and reference clients.

* Marketing tools as detailed above – trials, demonstrations, [[White paper|whitepaper]]s, and [[seminar]]s designed for a more detailed evaluation and validation of the solution in question
* Reference management – cultivation, management, and selection of client references willing to provide a potential purchaser with the perspective of a current (or past) client.
* Sales involvement – coordination of the right sales resource to interact with the prospect to navigate the final stages of the buying process including contract [[negotiation]], [[Terms of service|legal terms]] and conditions, and signoff.

The coordination of sales involvement, the selection of the right sales resource, and the timing of the involvement can be difficult to determine.  The scoring, ranking, and routing of leads into sales is a sufficiently deep topic to warrant further exploration.

===Sales involvement===

The involvement of sales professionals in the solution validation process involves three main aspects.  These are the same whether inside sales or field sales professionals are being involved.

* [[Lead scoring]] - understanding which prospective buyers warrant being contacted by a sales professional.  Lead scoring involves scoring two distinct aspects of the prospect; whether he or she is qualified to be a buyer, and whether he or she is interested in being a buyer.  The former looks at explicit information such as title, industry, and revenues to understand whether that individual is able to make a buying decision, while the latter examines implicit information such as recent online activity and marketing response in order to determine whether the individual is currently interested in making a buying decision.  Many Marketers will take a simple approach by labelling lead scoring criteria on two foundations: behavioral scoring and demographic scoring.
* '''Lead ranking''' – based on the scoring of leads, leads can be assigned ranks based on the business process sales should follow in interacting with the leads.  For example, if explicit scoring leads to a 1, 2, or 3 ranking on how qualified the lead is, while implicit scoring leads to an A, B, or C ranking on how interested the lead is, a follow-up process may have 1A leads contacted within 24hrs, 1B leads contacted by a field sales professional within 72hrs, while 1C, 2A, and 2B leads are contacted by an inside sales professional and 2C and all leads ranked as a 3 are not contacted.
* '''Lead routing''' – once a business process is determined, a lead routing process determines which lead should be connected with which salesperson, based on geographic territory, [[industry]], [[company]] size, or any other factor.  Often this involves management of the notification of the salesperson and monitoring of the time taken to follow up.

==Related disciplines==

In order to effectively manage and optimize the required communication, response, and lead management processes outlined above, marketers focused on demand generation must become proficient at two other related disciplines

* [[Data management]] – the centralization, de-duplication, profiling, appending, normalizing and cleansing of marketing data so that it can be effectively used to personalize communications, define target lists and segments, score leads, and route leads to sales.
* [[Marketing analytics]] – the analysis of the effectiveness of marketing efforts, from individual tactics such as [[email]] communications or [[landing page]]s through to overall [[Advertising campaign|campaign]] performance.

The '''Downing Street Press Secretary''' is an advisor to the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] on news media and how to manage the image of the British government to the press. The position is part of the Prime Minister's Office and involves using information on what is happening in the UK and around the world, to decide on how the Prime Minister should present his or her reaction to the media. The incumbent also advises on how to handle news stories and other information which could affect the current Prime Minister or the Ministry.

The current Press Secretary is Paul Harrison, following the resignation of [[Lizzie Loudon]] on 18 April 2017.

==Role==
The Press Secretary will address the lobby correspondents at 10 Downing Street to give journalists information on events attended by the Prime Minister, as well as current affairs in [[Downing Street]] and in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].&lt;ref name="A-Z Lobby"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lobby correspondents|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/a-z_of_parliament/h-l/82525.stm|website=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=29 September 2015|date=1 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Press Secretary works within the  [[10 Downing Street#Prime Minister's Office|Prime Minister's Office]] and the Downing Street Press Office.

==History==

'''Emad Khashoggi''' (born 25 March 1968, [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]) is a Saudi businessman and the head of COGEMAD. He initiated the [[Château Louis XIV]] development project in [[Louveciennes]], [[France]].
 
== Biography ==
Emad Khashoggi was born in [[Lebanon]]'s capital [[Beirut]]. His father, Adil Khashoggi, has headed up several property developments in [[Saudi Arabia]]. His grandfather, [[Muhammad Khashoggi]] was the personal physician to [[Ibn Saud|King Abdulaziz Al Saud]]. Emad Khashoggi is also the nephew of businessman [[Adnan Khashoggi]].

Emad Khashoggi received his secondary education at [[Institut Le Rosey|Le Rosey]] in Switzerland before attending [[Pepperdine University]] in California where he earned a [[Bachelor's degree]] in 1987.

== Projects ==

In 1989, Emad Khashoggi founded COGEMAD, a company that develops haute-couture estates and interiors.
In the early 2000s, after several successful property developments in France and overseas, in particular the renovation of [[Château du Verduron]] and [[Palais Rose in Vésinet|Palais Rose du Vésinet]], he and his company set their sights on a new project, homage to the 17th century architecture and a true international showcase of the finest French craftsmanship: the [[Château Louis XIV]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.1001mags.com/parution/entreprendre/numero-288-mars-2015/page-90-91-texte-integral ''Il construit de nouveaux châteaux de Versailles'', ''Entreprendre'', numéro 288 - mars 2015, pp. 90 et 91]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2009, a plot of wooded land between [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] and [[Marly-le-Roi]] was purchased and precipitated the project that reached completion three years following the start of the building works.
 
The design and development of the Château Louis XIV was the subject of a book published by the renowned French art magazine, Connaissance des Arts.&lt;ref&gt;''A Louveciennes, un palais des savoir faire'', ''Connaissance des Arts'', special issue ''Les métiers d'art en France 2012'' – March 2012, pp. 99 à 100&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In addition to the Château Louis XIV, Emad Khashoggi's past developments include the Palais Vénitien in [[Cannes]] (decor of French movie [[Möbius_(film)|Möbius]] with actor [[Jean Dujardin]]) and the renovation of [[Pierre Balmain]]'s former apartment in the prestigious [[Jean Walter]] building complex in Paris.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2859">'''Enrollment Management''' is a term that is used frequently in higher education to describe well-planned strategies and tactics to shape the enrollment of an institution and meet established goals.  Plainly stated, enrollment management is an organizational concept and a systematic set of activities designed to enable educational institutions to exert more influence over their student enrollments. {{ref|hossler}}

Such practices often include marketing, admission policies, retention programs, and financial aid awarding. Strategies and tactics are informed by collection, analysis, and use of data to project successful outcomes. Activities that produce measurable improvements in yields are continued and/or expanded, while those activities that do not are discontinued or restructured. Competitive efforts to recruit students is a common emphasis of enrollment managers.

The numbers of universities and colleges instituting offices of "enrollment management" have increased in recent years. These offices serve to provide direction and coordination of efforts of multiple offices such as admissions, financial aid, registration, and other student services. Often these offices are part of an enrollment management division.

Some of the typical aims of enrollment management include:

* Improving yields at inquiry, application, and enrollment stages. {{ref|citation1}}
* Increasing net revenue, usually by improving the proportion of entering students capable of paying most or all of unsubsidized tuition ("full-pays") {{ref|quirk}}
* Increasing demographic diversity {{ref|citation2}}
* Improving retention rates 
* Increasing applicant pools

According to Matthew Quirk {{ref|quirk3}}:
:More-advanced enrollment managers also tend to focus as much on retaining admitted students as on deciding whom to recruit and accept. They smooth out administrative hassles, guarantee at-risk students the advising and academic help they need, and ensure that the different parts of the university's bureaucracy work together to get students out the door with a degree.

'''FastTrack Schedule''' is a [[project management software]] program that is used for planning, tracking, and reporting project goals. Available since 1987, it is made by AEC Software, Inc., a small business headquartered in the Washington, D.C. area. 

FastTrack Schedule has a global customer base and has been localized into 6 languages (English, Japanese, French, German, Spanish, and Italian).  Some of their high profile users include: NASA, Nike, Amazon.com, Honda, Pixar, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and The Olympic Games. The application enables users to  organize tasks into project plans, assign resources to tasks, use effort driven scheduling, and view project details in [[Gantt chart]]s, monthly calendars, and resource histograms, and more.  

FastTrack Schedule's capabilities are suited for project management beginners&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Enterprise-Apps/Pings-Packets-from-eWEEK-Labs-%5B14%5D/ Pings &amp; Packets from eWEEK Labs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as experienced project managers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcn.com/print/25_6/40132-1.html The latest version of FastTrack makes it easy to see cause and effect&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; working in small to mid-sized project teams. Versions are available for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS|Mac OS X]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maclife.com/article/fasttrack_schedule_9_1 FastTrack Schedule 9.1- MacLife&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and files are cross-platform  compatible,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbtechnologymagazine.org/magazine/read/archives/articles/article.php?ProposalOnlineID=459 Small Business Technology Magazine - FastTrack Schedule 9 - by Small Business Technology Magazine Labs 2006 Top 10 Products of the Year&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; enabling team members on PCs and Macs to collaborate on projects.

FastTrack Schedule also exchanges data with spreadsheets (including Microsoft Excel), databases, organizers such as [[Microsoft Outlook]] and Apple's [[iCal]], Mindjet [[MindManager]] mind mapping software, and other project management software including [[Microsoft Project]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,133079/article.html PC World - FastTrack Schedule boosts Mindjet MindManager support&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 September 2012, [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fasttrack-schedule-go-project/id523327102?mt=8 FastTrack Schedule Go] for the iPad was released.  A productivity app sold on Apple iTunes, it allows the user to analyze, present, and take their schedule with them. It works with FastTrack Schedule Mac/Win files, XML, and Microsoft Project files.

==Some Features==
'''Intuitive Interface'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://mac-project-management-software-review.toptenreviews.com/fasttrack-schedule-details.html FastTrack Schedule 10 Specifications]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Mac product has a Format Bar that was modeled after the iWork suite, while the Windows product uses the Ribbon.  The Format Bar and Ribbon are both context-sensitive and contain key scheduling tools.  In addition, they can be customized by dragging and dropping features you use the most.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Base and Work Calendars'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;Choose Base Calendars such as standard, 24 hour, and night shift calendars, or customize your own. These calendars can be defined per task, so projects can have an unlimited number of Work Calendars.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Effort-Driven Scheduling'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;For tasks that can be completed faster by adding more resources, use Effort-Driven Scheduling for simple schedule compression. Automatically adjust task durations as resources are added or subtracted, while keeping the total work for a task constant.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Image Columns'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;Use Image Columns to add pictures of task items, staff, resources, designs, progress photos, etc, directly into column cells. Images automatically scale as thumbnails to match row heights and display as larger images when you hover over them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Assignment Contouring'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;Choose from eight built-in work contours or customize your own for the ultimate ease and flexibility in resource scheduling. Assignment contouring enables you to quickly re-distribute your resources' efforts on a task for those special cases and must-meet deadlines.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Work Usage Inspector'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;Monitor resource workloads while making assignments in the Schedule View. The Work Usage Inspector displays Resource Usage Graphs at the base of the Gantt chart to provide a detailed snapshot of a resource's free and busy time, enabling you to make precise assignments and effectively manage resource costs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Address Book Integration &amp; Resource Information Form'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;Add address book contacts – including their photo and contact details – directly into your projects. The Resource Information Form organizes work schedules, rates, and all contact information into a single comprehensive form.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''iMedia Browser'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;Use the iMedia Browser to add photos, logos, sketches, and other images to your schedule.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Etc.'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;Resource Management: Collect, organize, and track a resource's Details, Skill Sets, Materials/Supplies, Costs, Groups, by creating from scratch or importation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Collaboration: Work with others using Team Calendars, Timeline, Issue Tracking, Email Integration, and Dashboard.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;Blockquote&gt;Project Management: Includes tools for Task Management, Mind Maps, Task Feedback, Scheduling, Calendars, Timelines, Ganntt Charts, Interactive Gantt Charts, Reporting, Statistics, Work Load, Financials, Document Management, Privacy Settings, Budgetting, Critical Path Method, Project Templates, Baseline, Custom Baseline, Milestones. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Help &amp; Support: A robust and highly praised support system is provided. It includes: Training Courses, FAQ's, Tutorials, User Manual, Email Support, Online Form Support, Telephone Support, and an online forum.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Form 13F provides position-level disclosure of all institutional investment managers with more than $100m in assets under management with relevant [[Long (finance)|long]] US holdings. All US-listed equity securities (including ETFs) in the manager’s portfolio are included and detailed according to the number of shares, the ticker, the issuer name, etc. The full list of securities currently covered by form 13F includes more than 17,500 securities.&lt;ref name=securities&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13f/13flist2015q3.pdf Form 13F — Covered Securities]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Short (finance)|Short]] positions are not required to be disclosed and are not reported. Form 13F covers institutional investment managers, which include Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs), banks, insurance companies, [[hedge fund]]s, trust companies, pension funds, mutual funds, among natural persons or entities with investment discretion over its own account or another's.

Form 13F is required to be filed within 45 days of the end of a calendar quarter, or if that day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, the deadline is the next business day. So, for example, for positions held as of the end of December, Form 13F must be filed by February 14 (if it is not a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday).

Both the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA) designation and the CFA Institute make special mention of 13F-based analysis for due diligence and monitoring of investment managers, as well as investment-idea-generation. David Larrabee,&lt;ref name=sec2&gt;[https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/author/davidlarrabee/ Form 13F — David Larrabee, CFA Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; the director of Member and Corporate Products at the CFA Institute, regularly publishes 13F-based holdings analyses of institutional investors.

Absent access to privileged access to manager holdings, Form 13F provides a baseline level of data with which to analyze investment manager exposures, performance attribution, and associated risks.

More sophisticated investors can apply the Brinson Fachler performance attribution methodology to the time-series of 13F disclosures to assess security selection skill, sector picking skill, and position sizing skill. Calculating StockAlpha, for example, provides a metric on value derived from a manager's stock picking.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8205">HP Cloud Service Automation (HP CSA) is cloud management software from [[Hewlett-Packard]] that is used by companies and government agencies to automate the management of cloud-based IT-as-a-service, from order, to provision, and retirement.&lt;ref name="neovise"&gt;[http://www.neovise.com/node/238 "HP Cloud Service Automation," Neovise]&lt;/ref&gt; HP Cloud Service Automation orchestrates the provisioning and deployment of complex IT services such as of [[database]]s, [[middleware]], and packaged applications (i.e., ERP, Exchange).&lt;ref name="joab"&gt;Jackson, Joab. "HP updates IT automation suite for cloud deployments," May 13, 2013. InfoWorld. [http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/hp-updates-it-automation-suite-cloud-deployments-218447?page=0,0]&lt;/ref&gt; The software speeds deployment of application-based services across hybrid cloud delivery platforms and traditional IT environments.&lt;ref name="joab" /&gt;

The software is part of a broad portfolio of HP enterprise management software products aimed at helping companies manage the lifecycle of deployment and usage of [[cloud computing]], whether through public or private clouds, or both.

==Background on Cloud Computing and Automation==

According to the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], Information Technology Laboratory, “Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/cloud-computing/index.html National Institute of Standards and Technology. October 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many organizations are adopting cloud computing because it allows them to access applications, resources and services over the Internet on an “as-needed” or “per usage” basis. This has some cost and agility advantages for the IT department. According to a January 2011 [[Unisys]] poll, nearly half of U.S. companies consider cloud computing as the top IT priority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unisys.com/unisys/news/detail.jsp?id=1120000970009610085 Unisys news release.  Cloud Computing Dominates IT Priority List for 2011, Unisys Polls Show.  Jan. 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

While cloud computing can save IT departments money and increase flexibility, it does present some challenges.  These challenges include extra effort and increased difficulty for the IT department because of the complexity associated with the deployment and ongoing management of cloud infrastructure and applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://briefingsdirectblog.blogspot.com/2010/06/hp-bto-executive-on-how-cloud-service.html Dana Gardner’s Briefings Direct. “Cloud Service automation aids visibility and control.” June 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Automation and proper management are important when IT departments deploy cloud computing services because of these challenges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itbusinessedge.com/cm/blogs/cole/cloud-migration-whos-up-to-the-challenge/?cs=44867 IT Business Edge. “Cloud migration.  Who’s up to the challenge?” Cole. Dec. 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[International Data Corporation]] (IDC), the use of distributed server/workload automation tools can help lower capital and power and cooling costs by tracking and reclaiming [[virtual machine]]s, making IT staff more efficient by standardizing and streamlining manual processes, and speed the process of provisioning IT resources by enabling business users the ability to self-provision predefined IT resource.&lt;ref&gt;IDC, "IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Distributed Server/Workload Automation Software 2012 Vendor Analysis," July 2012. [http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=236186]&lt;/ref&gt;

==What HP Cloud Service Automation Does==

The function of HP Cloud Service Automation is to accelerate the speed of deployment of application-based services across a hybrid cloud delivery environment.&lt;ref name="joab" /&gt; Traditionally, IT staff were required to patch and update physical servers manually.&lt;ref name="joab" /&gt; Using HP Cloud Service Automation, IT organizations can update thousands of servers automatically.&lt;ref name="joab" /&gt;

HP Cloud Service Automation allows IT departments to move and manage applications among in-house (private) cloud systems, external (public) clouds and traditional IT systems.  HP Cloud Service Automation software is also designed to deliver unified security, governance and compliance across applications, as well as physical and virtual infrastructures.  The software automates key IT processes so that there is one consistent approach to IT resource management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/hp-launch-enterprise-cloud-service-371  IDG News Service: Infoworld.com. “HP to launch enterprise cloud service.” Jackson. January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

HP Cloud Service Automation also allows IT departments to dynamically monitor and provision server, storage and network elements as well as applications to meet the needs of current and upcoming workloads.   In addition, the solution allows IT to automatically grow and shrink the allocated resources in order to meet quality of service targets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/article_detail.html?compURI=tcm:245-595768&amp;pageTitle  HP News Release. “HP Launches CloudStart to Fast Track Private Clouds.” Aug. 2010.”]&lt;/ref&gt;

HP Cloud Service Automation Software is a component of HP VirtualSystem, a series of integrated server, storage, and networking infrastructures from HP for Citrix, HP-UX, Microsoft, and VMware virtual environments.&lt;ref&gt;"HP helps enterprise speed deployment of virtualization technologies," Datacenter Solutions UK, January 26, 2012. [http://www.dcsuk.info/news_full.php?id=21022&amp;title=HP-helps-enterprises-speed-deployment-of-virtualization-technologies]&lt;/ref&gt; HP VirtualSystem is part of the [[HP Converged Systems]] portfolio of system-based products that use [[Converged infrastructure]] for specific workloads. HP Cloud Service Automation Software is also included in [[HP CloudSystem]], a cloud infrastructure from HP that combines storage, servers, networking and software for organizations to build complete private, public and hybrid Cloud computing environments.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Carl. "HP CloudSystem: What exactly is it?" SearchCloudComputing, June 27, 2011
[http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/news/2240037306/HP-CloudSystem-What-exactly-is-it]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product Packaging==

In May 2013, HP packaged version 10 of HP Operations Orchestration, version 10 of HP Server Automation, version 10 of HP Database and Middleware Automation and HP Cloud Service Automation 3.2 into a single integrated package.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/hp-updates-it-automation-suite-cloud-deployments-218447&lt;/ref&gt; HP Cloud Service Automation is also available as a standalone software solution.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2013/05/13/hp-updates-cloud-management-software/&lt;/ref&gt;

==What HP Cloud Service Automation Works With==

HP Cloud Service Automation works with HP Operations Orchestration and HP Server Automation to provide IT lifecycle automation. HP Operations Orchestration is an integrated set of software and services that helps to automate distributed systems and heterogeneous computing environments. User organizations use HP OO to link together separate applications to create a workflow across them.&lt;ref name="joab" /&gt; HP Server Automation is used to manage physical and virtual servers as a lifecycle management platform. According to HP, HP SA helps to reduce administrator-to-server ratio by up to 60%.&lt;ref&gt;Rath, John. "HP updates cloud management software," 05/13/2013.

'''HotDocs''' is a [[document automation]] (also known as document generation or [[document assembly]]) software company currently owned by AbacusNext, the largest Technology-as-a-Service (TaaS) provider for the professional services sector. Version 1.0 was introduced in 1993.

==Description==
HotDocs is an integrated stack of technologies that enables the transformation of word-processing documents and graphical (PDF) forms into document-generation templates and the deployment of these dynamic templates in any environment, including desktop, on-premises, and Abacus Private Cloud.

Document modeling in HotDocs can range from simple variable insertion to the formation and insertion of complex, computed variables. Business logic consisting of IF/THEN statements and REPEAT loops can be built into the template to control the inclusion or exclusion of language blocks. HotDocs includes a variety of other scripting instructions and sets of pre-packaged functions. HotDocs also enables system architects to create custom functions.

In use, a HotDocs template queries the user for all the information necessary to generate a document (or set of documents) and saves the information in an answer file. The application then uses the saved information to assemble a custom version of the document, inserting and formatting variable information, inserting the right clauses based on transactional conditions, and inserting correct pronouns and verbs.

The HotDocs technology stack includes a logic core, a set of development tools, platforms for deploying intelligent templates in any environment, and a wide range of user-layer technologies (web applications for consuming HotDocs templates).

=== Logic Core ===
At the base of the HotDocs stack is a logic core, which consists of 1 million+ lines of code. The logic core enables HotDocs to handle the modeling complexities of documents and forms of any complexity and any length.

=== HotDocs Developer ===
HotDocs Developer is a document-generation-process-modeling environment that allows a system architect to build business logic into a document. HotDocs Developer, likewise, allows a system architect to design interviews (sequences of interactive data-gathering forms) that gather all the information necessary to generate the underlying document or documents. In combination, a modeled document and its accompanying interview are the two parts of a document automation template.

HotDocs Developer works within commercially available word processors (Word/WordPerfect).  This approach is useful for organizations that want to retain all the formatting attributes currently used in its word processing documents, including font faces, columns, pagination elements, etc.

HotDocs includes a development environment for the automation of PDF-based graphical forms (fields, check boxes, etc.). HotDocs allows for shared components among any number of documents, meaning all the Word documents, WordPerfect documents, and PDF-based forms in a set can be generated from a single answer file.

=== HotDocs Platforms ===
The HotDocs stack includes platforms for desktop, client/server (on-premises), and cloud deployment of HotDocs document-generation templates. Multiple third-party developers build their own technologies on the HotDocs desktop API. HotDocs Server
is designed for on-premises, server-based document generation.  HotDocs Cloud Services is a multi-tenant, cloud version of HotDocs Server designed for enterprises that want to forego the upfront cost and upkeep of HotDocs Server.

=== HotDocs User-Layer Technologies ===
HotDocs provides multiple off-the-shelf applications for using HotDocs templates, including a standard desktop application and several browser applications.

== History ==
What is now HotDocs Corporation began as a research project in the mid-1970s at Brigham Young University Law School.  Funded at the time by West Publishing, the project began as a code base, developed for the VAX mainframe computer running the VMS operating system. In the late 1980s, the project became commercial with the founding of Capsoft Development by Marshall Morrise. Capsoft Development licensed the technology from BYU and ported the code base into DOS. A few years later, the technology was re-birthed as HotDocs, a Windows-based version that reflected many of the original feature sets from the old VAX version.

Version 1 of HotDocs was released in 1993. Graphical forms functionality was added in 1996. In 1998, HotDocs Corporation was purchased by Matthew Bender. HotDocs Corporation became the property of LexisNexis in 1999, when LexisNexis bought Matthew Bender. In 2009, Capsoft UK, the largest independent reseller of HotDocs software, bought the HotDocs business from LexisNexis.

In 2017, HotDocs was acquired by AbacusNext.

== Products ==
* '''HotDocs Developer'''—used to transform documents and forms into templates. 
* '''HotDocs User'''—a desktop application for organizing and accessing templates built with HotDocs Developer.
* '''HotDocs Server'''—designed for server-based deployment of HotDocs templates.
* '''HotDocs Document Services'''—launched in January 2012, a cloud-based SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) product which allows law firms and other entities already using HotDocs to transition from the desktop to the internet for document production.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hotdocs.com/press/hotdocs-corporation-announces-ground-breaking-cloud-technology-lawyers&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''HotDocs Cloud Services'''—scheduled for release in 2013. Cloud Services is designed to extend browser-based document generation to small-to-medium enterprises.

== New Developments ==
In October 2011, HotDocs announced that its software would be deployed to 15,000 members of the U.S. Department of Justice. The company also entered into a partnership with Thomson Reuters to provide the technology platform for Interactive Decision Tools on Checkpoint, a research and analysis tool for tax lawyers and accountancy firms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hotdocs.com/press/thomson-reuters-and-hotdocs-collaborate-workflow-applications-tax-accounting-and-audit&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In January 2012, HotDocs released HotDocs Document Services, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application designed to extend browser-based document generation to small-to-medium-sized law firms.
HotDocs has recently launched HotDocs Author 1.0.  This is a massive bundle service for big enterprise businesses.  They are still retaining HotDocs Developer and User.  These are being sold to smaller businesses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7963">The '''Industry Classification Benchmark''' (ICB) is an [[industry classification]] [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] launched by [[Dow Jones and Company|Dow Jones]] and [[FTSE Group|FTSE]] in 2005 and now owned solely by FTSE International.  It is used to segregate markets into [[List of recognized economic sectors|sectors]] within the [[macroeconomy]].  The ICB uses a system of 10 industries, partitioned into 19 supersectors, which are further divided into 41 sectors, which then contain 114 subsectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icbenchmark.com|title=Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB)|author=|date=21 June 2017|website=icbenchmark.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icbenchmark.com/ICBDocs/ICB_%20Product_Spec_Nov2011.pdf Industry Classification Benchmark structure] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICB is used globally (though not universally) to divide the market into increasingly specific categories, allowing investors to compare industry trends between well-defined subsectors.  The ICB replaced the legacy [[FTSE Group|FTSE]] and [[Dow Jones and Company|Dow Jones]] classification systems on 3 January 2006, and is used today by the [[NASDAQ]], NYSE and several other markets around the globe. All ICB sectors are represented on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] except Equity Investment Instruments (8980) and Nonequity Investment Instruments (8990).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nyse.com/indexes/nyaindex.csv&lt;/ref&gt;

Dow Jones divested itself of its 50% interest in the ICB in 2011 and announced it was creating its own version of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.djindexes.com/index.php/dow-jones-indexes-divests-its-50-interest-in-industry-classification-benchmark-2/|title=Dow Jones Indexes Divests Its 50% Interest in Industry Classification Benchmark|publisher=Dow Jones Indexes|format=press release|date=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Bagot'''  J.P. (10 January 1849 – 29 August 1910) was a businessman and politician in the colony of South Australia.

John Bagot was born the second son of Christopher Michael Bagot (1817 – 8 November 1853) and Margaret Elizabeth Bagot, née Watts (ca.1823 – 6 November 1910) at his father's property "Koonunga", near [[Kapunda, South Australia]]. His mother was  a daughter of Capt. John Watts (of the 73rd Regiment), who was at one time Adelaide's Postmaster-General. His grandfather, who selected the property, was Capt. [[Charles Hervey Bagot]], of the 59th Regiment, who arrived in South Australia on the ''Birman'' in December 1840. It was on this same property that copper was discovered by Captain Bagot's youngest son Charles Samuel Bagot, which incorporated with the [[F. S. Dutton]]'s adjoining property "Anlaby", became Australia's first copper mine.

John Bagot was educated at [[St Peter's College, Adelaide|St. Peter's College]], then for several years worked for the National Bank of Australasia. In the 1870s he and his brother C. M. Bagot (1852–1899) took up the Peake Cattle Run, between Warrina and Lake Eyre, which they continued to run until around 1900. He also owned the "Springbank" property near Burra for a few years. For a long period he was a director of Bagot, Shakes, &amp; Lewis, Limited, Broken Hill Pty., the National Bank, the South Australian Brewing Company, the Alliance Assurance Company, and the [[South Australian Mining Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article164706051 |title=Obituary |newspaper=[[The Observer (Adelaide)|The Observer]] |location=Adelaide |date=3 September 1910 |accessdate=28 August 2015 |page=39 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was represented the seat of [[Electoral district of Victoria|Victoria]] in the [[South Australian House of Assembly]] from April 1884 to April 1887.

He married Lucy Josephine Ayers (ca.1857 – 11 May 1945), a daughter of [[Henry Ayers|Sir Henry Ayers]], on 24 September 1878. [[Walter Bagot (architect)|Walter Hervey Bagot]] (17 March 1880 – 27 February 1889), a noted architect, and founding partner in [[Woods Bagot|Woods and Bagot]] was the only child to survive to adulthood. They lived at Buxton Street, North Adelaide, later Park Terrace, Fitzroy until 1901, then "Forest Lodge", 19 Pine Street, [[Stirling, South Australia|Stirling]], where John established a fine garden. His library included a valuable collection of Australiana. For several years prior to his death Mr. Bagot was an invalid, and was obliged to retire altogether from public life, living on Pennington Terrace, North Adelaide, where he died.

==Recognition==
His widow endowed a prize for botany at the [[University of Adelaide]] in his name from 1912.&lt;ref&gt;http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/162342676?sortby=dateDesc&amp;q=%22of+John+Bagot%22&amp;c=picture&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7077">'''Luka Ćelović''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Лука Ћеловић}}; 18 October 1854 in [[Pridvorci (Trebinje)|Pridvorci]], near [[Trebinje]] – 15 August 1929 in [[Belgrade]]) was a [[Serbs|Serbian]] wholesaler, merchant and rentier. At the beginning of the 20th century he was one of the most influential people in [[Serbia]], a patriot and a great benefactor, also a philanthropist of education. He was the first president of the [[Belgrade Cooperative]].

==Biography==
He finished his grammar school in [[Trebinje]], [[Banja Luka]] and [[Brčko (town)|Brčko]], and after a basic education, he was denied higher education by Turkish authorities. Instead of languishing there he left [[Bosnia and Hercegovina]] in 1872 for [[Belgrade]], where Archimandrite [[Nićifor Dučić]], a family friend, found him a job as an apprentice in then famous store held by Radosavljević &amp; Ignjatijević.

Three years later, when [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875-1878)]] began, Ćelović went back to his native [[Hercegovina]] as a volunteer soldier. In combat against [[Ottoman empire|Turks]] he was wounded, but soon recovered and continued to fight. When [[Serbia]] declared war on the [[Ottoman Empire]], volunteers from Hercegovina went back to Belgrade, thus Luka continued combating in both Serbo–Turkish wars.

After the war, with the support of his countrymen, traders Aleksa Krsmanović and Rista Parnanos, Ćelović started his own business as an independent merchant, selling plums, corn, wheat and pigs. 

In 1882 he established the Belgrade Cooperative, whose main goal was to help the middle class traders and artists by providing soft loans and avoiding loan sharks. In 1899 Ćelović was elected as President of the Board of the Belgrade Cooperative. Self-taught, with a hard work ethic he made the [[Belgrade Cooperative]] one of the strongest Serbian financial institutions.
 
Ćelović also did a lot to help the weaker member of society, founding the Committee for the Protection of the Blind Girls in Belgrade.
 
Although he had a rudimentary education himself, his concern for the development of science and education was remarkable. It stemmed from the period of his life, during which he was part of the Chetnik movement, when he became closely connected with [[Milorad Gođevac]], general [[Jovan Atanacković]]  and the students from Old Serbia (now Macedonia), leading him to the lifelong conviction that education was the basis of the Serbian future. That and other reasons resulted in his making the [[University of Belgrade]] the sole beneficiary of his fortune when he died. 

Printing of the ''Glasnik Hemijskog Drustva Beograd'' (Bulletin of the Chemical Society) with Nikola A. Pušin as editor and chief, was enabled thanks to financial assistance from the Luka Ćelović-Trebinje Fund.

[[Milorad Gođevac]], impressed by the success of the Bulgarian agents and ''četnici'' in converting the Macedonian Slavs to Bulgarian nationalism, proposed a similar plan of action by Serbia. In 1902 a group of Serbian nationalists, headed by Luka Ćelović and Milorad Gođevac, organized the Executive Committee of the [[Serbian Chetnik Organization]]. Ćelović himself gave generous sums from his very considerable savings to the organization. A Committee (''Komitski odbor'') was organized at [[Vranje]] with branches at [[Leskovac]] and [[Niš]]. Serbia's government for a time discouraged this private action but educators and teachers who suffered at the hands of the Bulgars thought otherwise and eventually impressed upon the government and prevailed. 

Apart from being a successful businessman, Ćelović was also a supportive towards common welfare, he and Dr. Milorad Gođevac, a Belgrade physician, were funding troops to fight for [[Old Serbia]]. The Bulgarian committee noticed the danger in such actions, and sentenced Ćelović and Gođevac to death in absentia. An [[assassin]] was sent by them to Serbia, but he never made it to Belgrade.

Ćelović was indirectly linked with Serbian combat in [[Macedonian Struggle]], by financially helping troops to organize. In fact, Dr. Gođevac established a society which financially aided and recruited men for what became known as the "Četnik Campaign." The first president was Luka Ćelović and the other leaders of the campaign were [[Vasa Jovanović]], [[Ljubomir Kovačević]], [[Žika Rafajlović]] and [[Nikola Spasić]]. The men solicited for the cause, and Luka Ćelović donated the enormous sum of 50,000 ''dinars'' annually to the Četnik Campaign.

==Investing in Belgrade's Architectural Heritage==
Ćelović founded the Belgrade Cooperative and funded the construction of this extravagant and extraordinary building. His memory is best embodied by the buildings that now define [[Savamala]], without him Savamala, as it is now would not exist. His investment in the quarter regenerated this once squalid and frequently flooded market district. Ćelović built his home on "Kraljević Marko" Street as well as building the palatial [[Belgrade Cooperative]], now known as ''Geozavod'', and considered one of the most beautiful buildings in Belgrade, the work of architects Andra Stevanović and Nikola Nestorović. The magnificent [[Hotel Bristol, Belgrade|Hotel Bristol]], near [[Park Bristol]] and [[Park Luka Ćelović]] is the other gem in the Savamala neighbourhood. The buildings are his only real legacy, and their combination of using new architectural techniques and promoting Serbian [[Baroque]] and [[Art Nouveau]] in Belgrade show Ćelović to be a true visionary.

==Aftermath==
In his will, after passing away, Ćelović left almost all of his property to the [[University of Belgrade]]. Besides, he has founded an endowment named "A Foundation of Luka Ćelović – Trebinjac"

'''Mafersa S.A.''' is a [[Brazil]]ian manufacturer of passenger rail cars, buses and [[trolleybus]]es, and related components. It was founded in 1944 and was located in the city of [[São Paulo]].&lt;ref name="janes1997"&gt;Bushell, Chris (Ed.) (1997).  ''Jane's Urban Transport Systems 1997-98'', p. 451.  Coulsdon, Surrey (UK): [[Jane's Information Group]].  {{ISBN|0-7106-1562-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of 1997 it became a subsidiary of [[Alstom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mafersa S.A.|publisher=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=64783325 | accessdate=2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of its customers were in Brazil. However, export orders included, in 1990–92, 38 stainless-steel [[Push-pull train|push-pull]] [[commuter rail]] cars for the [[Virginia Railway Express]]&lt;ref name="janes1991"&gt;Bushell, Chris (Ed.)

''North American Commuter Rail 1994'', pp. 16 and 47. Pasadena (CA), US: [[Pentrex]]. ISSN 0160-6913.&lt;/ref&gt; and 256 [[Rapid transit|metro]]-car bodyshells for the [[Chicago Transit Authority]] (as a subcontractor to [[Morrison-Knudsen]]).&lt;ref name="janes1991"/&gt;  In the mid-1980s the company built more than 270 [[Rapid transit|metro]] cars for [[Rio de Janeiro Metro|Rio de Janeiro]] and more than 400 for [[São Paulo Metro|São Paulo]], and these were built under license from the [[Budd Company]].&lt;ref name="janes1984"&gt;Bushell, Chris; and Stonham, Peter (Eds.)

In addition to building new rail vehicles, Mafersa also carried out overhauls of existing rail cars.&lt;ref name="janes1997"/&gt;

In 1997, Mafersa was acquired by Alstom.  A subsidiary of Alstom keeping the same name, Mafersa SA, continued producing rail vehicle components (such as wheels and [[axle]]s), while manufacturing of rail cars also continued but now under the name, "Alstom Transporte do Brazil S.A."&lt;ref name="janes1999"&gt;Pattison, Tony (Ed.)

Coulsdon, Surrey (UK): Jane's Information Group.  {{ISBN|0-7106-1921-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alstom sold the technology and license of Mafersa SA to MWL Brasil Rodas &amp; Eixos Ltda. in November 1999, and this company continued making rail-vehicle components, initially under the Mafersa name.&lt;ref name="janes2002"&gt;Pattison, Tony (Ed.)

==Buses==
Mafersa entered the field of bus manufacturing in 1985, with development of a bus chassis and a [[monocoque]] (or integral) trolleybus.&lt;ref name="janes1989"&gt;Bushell, Chris (Ed.) (1989).  ''Jane's Urban Transport Systems 1989'', p. 451.  Coulsdon, Surrey (UK): [[Jane's Information Group]].  {{ISBN|0-7106-0881-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Production of [[trolleybus]]es lasted only from 1986 until 1988 and was relatively small, totalling only 85 vehicles, of which  84 were two-axle vehicles and one was [[articulated bus|articulated]].&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;Murray, Alan (2000).

[[File:Goat Island Marine Reserve.JPG|thumb|300px|right|&lt;center&gt;Cape Rodney-Okakari Point, [[Goat Island (Auckland)|Goat Island]] Marine Reserve (Leigh, Warkworth, New Zealand).&lt;/center&gt;]]

A '''marine reserve''' is a type of [[marine protected area]] that has [[legal]] protection against [[fishing]] or development. As of 2007 less than 1% of the world’s oceans had been set aside in marine reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Marine_reserves|title=Marine reserves|author=Ben Halpern|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits include increases in the diversity, density, biomass, body size and reproductive potential of fishery and other species within their boundaries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/08920753.2014.877758| title = Introduction| journal = Coastal Management| volume = 42| issue = 2| pages = 81–86| year = 2014| last1 = White | first1 = A. T. | last2 = Green | first2 = A. L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, scientists had studied more than 150 marine reserves in at least 61 countries and monitored biological changes inside the reserves. The number of species in each study ranged from 1 to 250 and the reserves ranged in size from 0.006 to 800 square kilometers (0.002 to 310 square miles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.piscoweb.org/outreach/pubs/reserves|title=The Science of Marine Reserves|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030323214527/http://www.piscoweb.org/outreach/pubs/reserves/|archivedate=2003-03-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the World Parks Association adopted a target of establishing no-take zones for 30% of each habitat globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://depts.washington.edu/mpanews/MPA140.pdf|title = World Parks Congress recommends target of 30% no-take MPA coverage worldwide|last = |first = |date = December 2014|work = MPA News|access-date = January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==

A review of studies of 34 families (210 species) of coral reef fishes demonstrates that the design of a marine reserve has important implications for its ability to protect habitat and focal species.&lt;ref name=green1&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Biological Reviews
| year=2014

| first9=Alan T. |last9=White | pmid=25423947 | volume=90 | pages=1215–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Size and shape ===
Effective reserves included habitats that support the life history of focal species (e.g. home ranges, nursery grounds, migration corridors and spawning aggregations), and were located to accommodate movement patterns among them.&lt;ref name="green1" /&gt;

Movement patterns (home ranges, [[ontogenetic]] shifts and spawning migrations) vary among and within species, and are influenced by factors such as size, sex, behaviour, density, habitat characteristics, season, tide and time of day. For example, damselfishes, butterflyfishes and angelfishes travel &lt;0.1–0.5&amp;nbsp;km, while some sharks and tuna migrate over thousands of kilometres. Larval dispersal distances tend to be &lt;5–15&amp;nbsp;km, and self-recruitment to new habitat is common.&lt;ref name="green1"/&gt;

The review indicated that effective marine reserves are more than twice the size of the home range of focal/target species (in all directions). The presence of effective marine management outside the reserve may allow smaller reserves.&lt;ref name="green1" /&gt; Reserve size recommendations apply to the specific habitats of focal species, not the overall size. For example, coral reef species require coral reef habitats rather than open ocean or seagrass beds.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Marine reserve whose boundaries are extensively fished benefit from compact shapes (e.g., squares or circles rather than elongated rectangles). Including whole ecological units (e.g., an offshore reef) can reduce exports where that is desired.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Habitats ===
Minimum sustainable population sizes have not been determined for most marine populations. Instead, fisheries ecologists use the fraction of unfished stock levels as a proxy. Meta-analyses suggest that maintaining populations above ∼37% of those levels generally ensures stable populations, although variations in fishing pressure allow fractions as small as 10% or as large as 40% (to protect species such as sharks and some grouper that have lower reproductive output or slower maturation). Higher fractions of habitat protection may protect areas vulnerable to disturbances such as typhoons or climate change. 20–30% protection can achieve fisheries objectives in areas with controlled fishing pressure and is the minimum level of habitat protection recommended by [[IUCN]]-[[World Commission on Protected Areas|WCPA]].

=== Special areas ===
Many fish species congregate to facilitate spawning. Such congregations are spatially and temporally predictable and increase the species' vulnerability to overfishing. Species such as groupers and rabbitfishes travel long distances to congregate for days or weeks. Such gatherings are their only opportunities to reproduce and are crucial to population maintenance. Species such as snappers and parrotfishes congregate in feeding or resting areas. Juveniles may congregate in nursery areas without adults. Such special areas may require only seasonal protections if at other times no vital activities are taking place. Such reserves must be spaced to allow focal species to journey among them. If the location of such special areas is unknown, or is too large to include in a reserve, management approaches such as seasonal capture and sales restrictions may provide some protection. [[Sea turtle]] nesting areas, [[dugong]] feeding areas, [[cetacean]] migratory corridors and calving grounds are examples of other special areas that can be protected seasonally. Other types of special areas include isolated habitats that have unique assemblages and populations, habitats that are important for [[endemic species]] and highly diverse areas.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Isolated populations ===
Isolated populations (e.g.,those on  remote [[atolls]])  have high conservation value where they harbor endemic species and/or unique assemblages. A location or population 20–30&amp;nbsp;km from its nearest neighbor generally qualifies as isolated in the absence of a persistent linking current. Their isolation (low connectivity) requires such areas to be largely self-replenishing. This leaves them less resilient to disturbance. Sustaining their marine species requires a higher fraction of living areas to be protected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Recovery ===
Coral reef fish species recovery rates (from e.g., overfishing) depend on their life history and factors such as ecological characteristics, fishing intensity and population size. In the [[Coral Triangle]], species at lower [[trophic levels]] that have smaller maximum sizes, faster growth and maturation rates and shorter life spans tend to recover more quickly than species having the opposite characteristics. For example, in the Philippines, populations of planktivores (e.g., fusiliers) and some herbivores (e.g., parrotfishes) recovered in ''&lt;''5–10 years in marine reserves, while predators (e.g., groupers) took 20–40 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Increased fishing pressure adversely affects recovery rates (e.g., Great Barrier Reef and Papua New Guinea).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Long-term protection allows species with slower recovery rates to achieve and maintain ecosystem health and associated fishery benefits. Permanent protection protects these species over the long-term. Short-term protections do not allow slow-recovering species to reach or maintain stable populations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In some Coral Triangle countries (e.g., Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands), short term protections are the most common form of traditional marine resource management. These protections can help address problems at lower trophic levels (e.g., herbivores) or allow spawning to succeed. Other reasons for adopting short-term protections include allowing communities to stockpile resources for feasts or close areas for cultural reasons. Short-term/periodic reserves also may function as partial insurance by enhancing overall ecosystem resilience against catastrophes. Reopened reserves can be protected by management controls that limit the harvest to less than the increase achieved during closure, although at greatly reduced recovery rates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Resilience ===
Some habitats and species are better prepared environmental changes or extremes. These include coral communities that handle high sea surface temperature (SST); areas with variable SSTs and carbonate chemistry and areas adjacent to undeveloped low-lying inland areas that coastal habitats can expand into as [[sea levels]] rise. Such areas constitute [[climate change]] refugia and can potentially better protect biodiversity than more fragile areas. They may also provide fishery benefits, since habitat loss from climate change is a major fishery threat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Local practices ===
Local practices such as overfishing, blast fishing, trawling, coastal development and pollution threaten many marine habitats. These threats decrease ecosystem health and productivity and adversely affect focal and other species. Such practices can also decrease resilience. Some practices that originate beyond reserve boundaries (e.g., [[Surface runoff|runoff]]) can be mitigated by considering their impacts within broader management frameworks. Areas that are not threatened by such practices and that are adjacent to other unthreatening areas may be better choices for reserves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Networks ==
Networks of marine reserves can support both [[fisheries management]] and [[biodiversity conservation]]. The size, spacing and location of reserves within a network must respect larval dispersal and movement patterns of species that are targeted for protection.&lt;ref name="green1" /&gt;

=== Design ===
Existing ecological guidelines for designing networks independently focus on achieving either fisheries, biodiversity or climate change objectives or combinations of fisheries and biodiversity or biodiversity and climate change. These three goals have different implications for network design. The most important are reserve size and protection duration (permanent, long term, short term, or periodic closures).&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==== Diversity ====
Maintaining diversity involves protecting all species. Generally this involves protecting adequate examples of each major habitat (e.g., each type of coral reef, mangrove and seagrass community). Resiliency to threats improves when multiple examples of each habitat are protected.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

To address biodiversity or climate change, reserves 4–20&amp;nbsp;km across are recommended, because they protect larger populations of more species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Climate change ===
Protecting areas that have already proven resilient to ecological changes and/or are relatively well-protected by other protocols are likely to better survive climate change as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Fisheries ====
Reserves 0.5–1&amp;nbsp;km across export more adults and larvae to fished areas, potentially increasing recruitment and stock replenishment there. Such small reserves are common in the [[Coral Triangle]], where they benefited some fisheries.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Connectivity ===
Connectivity is the linking of local populations through the (voluntary) dispersal of individuals. Connected reserves are close enough to each other that larvae, juveniles or adults can cross from one to another as their behavior patterns dictate. Connectivity is a key factor in network design, since it allows a disturbed reserve to recover by recruiting individuals from other, potentially overpopulated, reserves. Effective networks spaced reserves at distances of &lt;15&amp;nbsp;km from each other, with smaller reserves spaced more closely.&lt;ref name="green1" /&gt;

Most coastal fish species have a bipartite life cycle where larvae are [[pelagic]] before settling out of the [[plankton]] to live on a reef. While these fish travel varying distances during their life history, their larvae have the potential to move 10s–100s of km, more than the more sedentary adults and juveniles, which have home ranges of &lt;1 m to a few km. Adults and juveniles of some species travel 10s–100s of kilometers as they mature to reach appropriate habitats (e.g., such as coral reef, mangrove and seagrass habitats) or to migrate to spawning areas. When adults and juveniles leave a marine reserve, they become vulnerable to fishing. However, larvae can generally leave a reserve without elevated risk because of their small size and limited fishery exposure. Effective networks account for the movement patterns of target species at each life cycle stage.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Given a strong, consistent current, siting marine reserves upstream increases downstream populations.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Other protected marine categories ==
Marine reserves are distinct [[marine park]]s, but there is some overlap in usage.

== Open ocean reserves ==
As of April 2008 no high seas marine reserves had been established. [[Greenpeace]] is campaigning for the "doughnut holes" of the western pacific to be declared as marine reserves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=

== AEK Athens involvement ==
[[File:Nik8.jpg|thumb|130px|Notias at OACA]]
With AEK struggling terribly in corruption and the prospect of relegation to the fourth division looming, [[Demis Nikolaidis]] (ex club charismatic player) supported by the majority of AEK fans, established a [[consortium]] of businessmen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capital.gr/news.asp?Details=554393 |script-title=el:ΠΑΕ με "άρωμα θάλασσας" |publisher=Capital |date=2008-08-11 |language=Greek |accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Polys V. Hajioannou]], [[Petros Pappas]] and [[Takis Kanellopoulos (businessman)|Takis Kanellopoulos]], who convinced Nikos Notias to participate in the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tovima.gr/default.asp?pid=2&amp;artid=190905&amp;ct=5&amp;dt=07/09/2008 |script-title=el:Νίκος Νοτιάς |publisher=To Bhma Online |date=2008-09-07 |language=Greek |accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach was made by Ghikas Goumas, grandson of the late Nikos Goumas (former President of the Club). At the first contact, which was held in [[New York City]], Nikos Notias was convinced that the operators had pure purposes, and a great vision for the clubs regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sport24.yooblog.gr/2008/09/05/441/ |script-title=el:Γλυκός Νοτιάς |publisher=SPORT 24 |date=2008-09-05 |language=Greek |accessdate=2010-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714114336/http://sport24.yooblog.gr/2008/09/05/441/ |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small doubts initially led Notias to take a small percentage of shares (about 8%) but he changed his mind quickly, when he realized that the fans totally backed-up the effort and gradually, over a period of three and a half years, he became the major holder of the shares, reaching 35%. His financial assistance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.article&amp;id=37287 |script-title=el:Μόνο ο Νοτιάς βάζει λεφτά! |publisher=Ελευθεροτυπία Online |date=2009-04-22 |language=Greek |accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the club amounts to 18 million [[euros]] but the largest and most expected [[project]] of Nikos Notias, remains the clubs Sports Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanea.gr/default.asp?pid=2&amp;ct=5&amp;artid=85211 |script-title=el:"Απογειώνεται" από τα Σπάτα |publisher=TA NEA Online |date=2008-09-04 |language=Greek |accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will cost over 25 million [[euros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aek365.gr/article.php?id=56339 |script-title=el:Χλιδή το προπονητικό |publisher=Aek365.gr |date=2010-04-21 |language=Greek |accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be the biggest project in the modern history of the club and Notias's intention is to name it "Harry Notias" in honour of his father. Among the tremendous economic crisis in Greece and due to the clubs financial problems, AEK Athens in June 2013 declared bankruptcy and was self-relegated to the amateur third division. The Athletic Center of Spata nowadays includes state of the art facilities, three fields (one of them with synthetic turf) for soccer, a fitness and health center with weight-training and fitness rooms, a cryotherapy center and more. Unfortunately, the rest of the project (the clubs Museum, Hotel, Aquatic Center and two more soccer fields) could not be delivered and remained unfinished.

'''Pierre Rainier Stefano Casiraghi ''' (born 5 September 1987) is the younger son of [[Caroline, Princess of Hanover]], and her second husband, [[Stefano Casiraghi]]. His maternal grandparents were [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco]], and American actress [[Grace Kelly]]. Casiraghi is eighth in the [[line of succession to the Monegasque throne]], following his twin cousins, his mother, brother [[Andrea Casiraghi|Andrea]], nephews [[Alexandre Casiraghi|Alexandre]] and Maximillian Casiraghi, and his niece [[India Casiraghi]].

== Early life and education ==

Casiraghi was born in 5 September 1987 at [[Princess Grace Hospital Centre]], in [[La Colle, Monaco|La Colle]], [[Monaco]]. He is named after his maternal great-grandfather, [[Prince Pierre, Duke of Valentinois]], his maternal grandfather, [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Prince Rainier III]], and his father. His godparents are his uncle, [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Prince Albert II]], and his aunt by marriage Laura Sabatini Casiraghi, the wife of his uncle Daniele.&lt;ref name="michaelsebook" /&gt; Casiraghi was three years old at the time of his father's death in a boating accident. He spent his earliest years, after his father's death, living at his mother's farmhouse in the quaint town of [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]].&lt;ref name="michaelsebook" /&gt;

He attended a state school in [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]].&lt;ref name="michaelsebook" /&gt; However, after his mother's remarriage to [[Prince Ernst August of Hanover (born 1954)|Ernst August, Prince of Hanover]], the family moved to [[Fontainebleau]], to be nearer to [[Paris]] and [[London]], the latter being where his new stepbrothers lived with their mother.&lt;ref name="michaelsebook" /&gt; It is assumed that Casiraghi passed the [[French Baccalaureate]] exam in the summer of 2005 since he shortly afterwards began [[university]]. One year later, in fact, he moved to [[Milan]] to begin a three-year undergraduate course in International Economics and Management at [[Bocconi University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2006/settembre/24/figlio_Carolina_Bocconi_come_papa_co_9_060924063.shtml |title=Archivio Corriere della Sera |website=Archiviostorico.corriere.it |date=2016-02-29 |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides [[French language|French]], he is fluent in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[English language|English]], and knows some [[German language|German]].&lt;ref name="us.hellomagazine.com"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://us.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2014090520820/pierre-casiraghi-10-facts-birthday/ |title=Pierre Casiraghi: 10 facts about Princess Caroline's son |website=Us.hellomagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also plays the [[saxophone]].&lt;ref name="us.hellomagazine.com"/&gt;
&lt;!--Prince Pierre Casiraghi--&gt;

==Humanitarian and business activities==
From 30 January to 13 February 2007, Casiraghi accompanied his mother on a [[humanitarian]] tour of Africa.&lt;ref name="amade"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070519035117/http://www.monaco-consulate.com/Princess_of_Hanover/africa.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt; They visited [[Niger]], [[Burundi]], the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], and [[South Africa]] on behalf of Princess Caroline's role as President of [[AMADE Mondiale]].&lt;ref name="amade"/&gt;

In June 2009, Casiraghi became the majority shareholder of the Monaco-based construction company Engeco, which his father founded in 1984. His uncle Marco remains in the position of President over Engeco. The acquisition of the majority shares to Casiraghi's name was handled by the [[Milan]]-based legal firm [[Bird &amp; Bird]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twobirds.com/Italian/NEWS/PRESSRELEASES/Pagine/Lo_Studio_Legale_Bird_Bird_Italia_assiste_Pierre_Casiraghi_nell_acquisizione_della_quota_maggioritaria_di_ENGECO_SAM.Aspx |title=News Centre |website=Twobirds.com |date=2013-01-21 |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casiraghi is also the majority shareholder of [[Monacair]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.podcastjournal.net/NOMINATION-DE-PIERRE-CASIRAGHI-COMME-MEMBRE-D-HONNEUR-DE-LA-JEUNE-CHAMBRE-ECONOMIQUE_a7955.html |title=Nomination De Pierre Casiraghi Comme 'Membre D'Honneur' De La Jeune Chambre Economique |website=Podcastjournal.net |date=2011-04-16 |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="montecarlonews.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montecarlonews.it/notizie/argomenti/altre-notizie-1/articolo/pierre-casiraghi-membro-onorario-della-jeune-chambre-economique.html |title=Pierre Casiraghi membro onorario della Jeune Chambre Economique - MontecarloNews: notizie su Montecarlo, Monaco, Mentone, Nizza, Antibes, Costa Azzurra |website=Montecarlonews.it |date=2011-04-16 |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casiraghi is on the Management Committee of the [[Yacht Club de Monaco]].&lt;ref name="monacochannel" /&gt; In this capacity, he sponsored the “Sail for a Cause" charity race,&lt;ref name="monacochannel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monacochannel.mc/Chaines/Yacht-Club-de-Monaco/ACTUS-PHOTOS/Sail-for-a-cause-la-regate-du-caeur2 |title=Sail for a cause : la régate du cœur / ACTUS &amp; PHOTOS / Yacht Club de Monaco / Chaines - MC Channel - Chaines vidéos de Monaco |language=fr |website=Monacochannel.mc |date= |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; a cause which was organized by his cousin Leticia de Massy,&lt;ref name="sailforacause" /&gt; using her social network LeSpot.Net to promote it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spirit of Generosity|url=https://www.yacht-club-monaco.mc/en/spirit-of-generosity/|website=Yacht Club de Monaco|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Sail for a Cause'' raises money for two charities: the Monaco Collectif Humanitaire and the Maison Notre Dame de Paix in Chad.&lt;ref name="michaelsebook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sailforacause" /&gt; The former funds surgeries for children around the world;&lt;ref name="sailforacause"&gt;{{cite web|title=50.000 € GATHERED FOR MONACO COLLECTIF HUMANITAIRE THANKS TO "SAIL FOR A CAUSE"|url=http://mch.mc/en/50-000-e-gathered-for-monaco-collectif-humanitaire-thanks-to-sail-for-a-cause/|accessdate=14 November 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114094016/http://mch.mc/en/50-000-e-gathered-for-monaco-collectif-humanitaire-thanks-to-sail-for-a-cause/|archivedate=14 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter helps migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chad: assisting migrants and other vulnerable groups|url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/update/2011/chad-update-2011-10-13.htm|website=International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=14 November 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801190139/https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/update/2011/chad-update-2011-10-13.htm|archivedate=1 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Casiraghi was inducted as an honorary member of the ''Jeune Chambre Economique de Monaco'' (JCEM).&lt;ref name="montecarlonews.it"/&gt;

==Inshore Racing==
Casiraghi is a participant in the sport of [[sailing (sport)|inshore racing]], which differs from offshore racing in that it is done along the coastlines.

Casiraghi is the [[Sea captain#Skipper|skipper]] of Team Malizia, the crew which sails a [[sailing hydrofoil|hydrofoil sailboat]] (also called a foiling catamaran) in the annual GC32 Racing Tour. Team Malizia takes its name from ''Il Malizia'', which means the Cunning, and which was the nickname assigned to Casiraghi's medieval ancestor [[François Grimaldi]].&lt;ref name="michaelsebook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knightley|first1=Emma|title=Princely Monaco XXI: The House of Grimaldi in the 21st Century|date=29 November 2017|ISBN=9780359058945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Casiraghi paired with [[Boris Herrmann]] to sail in the [[Fastnet Race]]. Starting at [[Cowes]], moving up to Ireland and then back down to [[Devon]]shire, they finished the race in third place.&lt;ref name="michaelsebook" /&gt;

However, in May 2014, he competed in a professional car race for the first time at the [[Volkswagen Scirocco R-Cup]] in [[Hockenheim]].

'''Robert Allan''' (1847 &amp;ndash; 8 December 1927) was a prominent businessman and manufacturer of [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]].

==Early life==
Allan's parents arrived in New Zealand aboard the Thomas Harrison in 1842.  Born in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] in 1847,&lt;ref name="ChristchurchLibrary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/People/A/AllanRobert/|title=Robert Allan, 1847-1927|work=christchurchcitylibraries.com|publisher=Christchurch City Libraries|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/629z2ZJ2l|archivedate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allan and his family moved to [[Wellington]] for several years and to [[Port Levy]] in 1851.  The Allan family later settled in [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]]. Robert's father (also Robert) and uncle Magnus Allan were in business with John Grubb and notably were commissioned to construct the [[Canterbury Association]] wharf at Lyttelton for Captain [[Joseph Thomas (surveyor)|Joseph Thomas]].

==Early career==
Allan was educated at the Church of England School under later at the Scots School.  Joining the firm of J. T. Peacock &amp; Co. at 15, Allan began a prosperous mercantile career.  In the early 1870s he founded together with Mr Lightband, the boot and [[shoemaking|shoe manufacturer]]s and general importers Lightband, Allan &amp; Co.  This firm later became the national concern of Skelton, Frostick and Co. Ltd which was famous for manufacturing Zealandia brand boots.  In 1895 the firm erected a substantial four story brick building in Hereford Street, Christchurch which was the largest boot factory in the Colony.  After Allan's retirement and subsequent death, Skelton Frostick fell victim to the difficult conditions of the Great Depression and was liquidated in the 1930s.

==Involvement with Christchurch civic life==
In 1900, Allan was president of both the Industrial Association and of the Jubilee Exhibition committee for Canterbury.  He was appointed a Royal Reception Commissioner for the visit of the 1901 visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later [[King George V]] and Queen Mary) along with Sir [[Henry Wigram]] and Mr. Stead.  Allan was also active in the Canterbury [[Chamber of Commerce]], and one of the earliest members and the first treasurer of Christchurch's Union Rowing Club. He was a longtime director of the Kaiapoi Woollen Company, as well as [[electric lighting]] and tramway enterprises.

Allan, in personal capacity and in his role as director was heavily involved in the [[trade fair|promotional exhibition]]s of New Zealand made products.  As President of the Industrial Association (1879-1881) he presided over the first Christchurch Industrial Exhibition in 1880.  He was on the committee of the 1883 exhibition and in 1895 Robert had been elected a life member of the Association.  He was appointed chairman of the Early History Committee of the Association.  In 1900 Allan was President of both the Industrial Association and of the 1900 Jubilee Exhibition Committee.

Allan's role and experience in exhibitions made him a natural choice for one of the Executive Commissioners of the New Zealand International Exhibition in 1906.  G. S. Munro has been named as Government representative and Chairman of commissioners and Robert Allan named Vice-Chairman.  Other commissioners included Sir [[John Hall (New Zealand politician)|John Hall]] (Mayor of Christchurch) and Mr. William Reece (ex-Mayor). It appears that Munro's dictatorial approach and treatment of his fellow commissioners took a serious toll on the organising committee and it is likely that in frustration Allan withdrew from the commission, sighting ill health as the reason.  The Colonist of 11 August 1906 stated that Sir [[Joseph Ward]] had accepted Robert Allan's resignation. Though careful not to ascribe outright blame to Munro, the media were not fooled by the Allan's diplomatic resignation and pursued the matter that became known as "The Exhibition Trouble.’ `Sir Joseph Ward was forced to investigate the matter further.

==Family life==
On 14 April 1869 Allan was married to Martha Haswell Wood at St Michaels Church, [[Merivale]] by the Very Rvd. Dean Jacobs.  The couple had five daughters and two sons.  In 1881 Allan had purchased Glenmore in [[Hillsborough, Canterbury|Hillsborough]], [[Opawa]] from John Chapman who had bought the house the previous year from John Barton Arudnel Acland of Mt Peel station.  The house was built for Henry Selfe who was agent for the Canterbury Association but was rarely used by the first owner himself.  Today, Glenmore is a Category II listed home by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.

Allan later purchased Abberley in Springfield Avenue, [[St Albans, New Zealand|St Albans]], Christchurch.  Abberley had been built in 1863 by well known importer and merchant Thomas James Maling (1836-1922). It was a substantial home with vast gardens &amp;mdash; including a caged cherry orchard. The two hectare private garden is today the grounds of Abberley Park. The house was demolished in the 1930s after the City Council purchased the property.  Allan also owned rural land in Canterbury, Northland and a {{convert|1500|acre|adj=on}} sawmill at Tarawhiti. One of the properties at Nukutawhiti, Whangerai, was farmed by his son Robert S Allan.  Robert Allan was staying at Nukatawhiti, his son’s sheep station in Northland, at the time of his death in 1927. Martha and Robert Allan are buried in the [[Bromley Cemetery, Christchurch]].

'''Scottish Enterprise''' is a sponsored [[non-departmental public body]] of the [[Scottish Government]] which encourages [[economic development]], [[Business|enterprise]], innovation and [[investment agency|investment]] in business. The body covers the eastern, [[central belt|central]] and [[Southern Uplands|southern]] parts of [[Scotland]]&lt;ref name="ScottAff4"&gt;{{cite web |title=Our Borderlands - Our Future : Final Report - Scottish Affairs 4) Economic development and enterprise|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmscotaf/571/57107.htm|website=UK Parliament|publisher=House of Commons|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst a similar body, [[Highlands and Islands Enterprise]], operates in north-western Scotland. 

==History==
The body began as the Scottish Development Agency in 1975. The first Chairman of the SDA was [[Sir William Gray]] former [[Lord Provost]] of [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Herald, obituary of Sir William Gray 11 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish Enterprise was created on 1 April 1991 under the Enterprise and New Towns (Scotland) Act 1990&lt;ref name="1990Act"&gt;{{cite web|title=Enterprise and New Towns (Scotland) Act 1990 - Introductorary Notes|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/35/introduction|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=Crown Copyright|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. That act dissolved the Scottish Development Agency [SDA], created in 1975 and the Highlands and Islands Development Board forming Scottish Enterprise alongside the [[Highlands and Islands Enterprise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fairley|first1=J.|last2=Lloyd|first2=M.

Scottish Enterprise was created with a structure of Local Enterprise Companies (LECs). Initially these were Limited Companies with boards led by local businesspeople, but from 2000 they became wholly owned subsidiaries of Scottish Enterprise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/docs/central/2004/nr_040617_scottish_enterprise.pdf|title=Scottish Enterprise Account management services to high-growth businesses|date=June 2004|publisher=Audit Scotland|pages=8–9|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were subsequently wound up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12454078.Scottish_Enterprise_set_to__face_multi_million_VAT_bill/|title=Scottish Enterprise set to face multi-million VAT bill|last1=Adams|first1=Lucy|last2=Dinwoodie|first2=Robbie|date=22 November 2007|work=The Herald|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 2008, the skills function of Scottish Enterprise moved out of the organisation to the newly formed [[Skills Development Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Education/skills-strategy/adviceandguidance/SkillsDevelopmentScotla|title=Skills Development Scotland|publisher=Scottish Government|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Scottish Enterprise has around 1,100 staff based in [https://www.scottish-enterprise.com/locations 14 offices across the UK and a further 33 overseas].

Organisational structure consists of a board headed by Chairman, Bob Keiller to oversee fulfilment of the objectives established by the [[Scottish Government]] and an executive leadership team responsible for the day-to-day running of the organisation&lt;ref name="AboutUs"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us - Leadership|url=https://www.scottish-enterprise.com/about-us/our-leadership/|website=Scottish Enterprise|publisher=Scottish Enterprise|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The leadership team consists of:

*Steve Dunlop - Chief Executive
*Linda Hanna - Managing Director, Strategy and Sectors 
*Jane Martin - Managing Director, Customer Operations 
*Iain Scott - Chief Financial Officer 
*Carolyn Stewart - Managing Director, People 
*Paul Lewis - Managing Director, International Operations

==Finances==
Scottish Enterprise is a [[Non-departmental public bodies of the Scottish Government|non-departmental public body of the Scottish Government]], although it also raises part of its budget from other sources such as property rental and disposal of assets. The Scottish Government's draft spending plans for 2018/2019 allocates £256 million to Scottish Enterprise supporting [[Scottish Development International]]&lt;ref name="2018Budget"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Budget: draft budget 2018-2019  Chapter 4: Enterprise and Skills Bodies|url=https://beta.gov.scot/publications/scottish-budget-draft-budget-2018-19/pages/7/|website=Scottish Government|publisher=Scottish Government|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Partners ==
Scottish Enterprise works with a range of other local, national and international strategic partners, from industry and the public sector to help deliver its wider range of services and sector-specific support across international trade, innovation, investment and inclusive growth.

These include:
* [[Scottish Government|The Scottish Government]]

{{primary sources|date=May 2014}}
The '''Standard Industrial Classification''' (SIC) is a system for classifying [[industry|industries]] by a four-digit code. Established in the [[United States]] in 1937, it is used by government agencies to classify industry areas. The SIC system is also used by agencies in other countries, e.g., by the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Companies House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/infoAndGuide/sic/sic2007.shtml|title=SIC 2007|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States the SIC code is being supplanted by the six-digit [[North American Industry Classification System]] (NAICS code), which was released in 1997; however certain government departments and agencies, such as the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), still use the SIC codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/|title=North American Industry Classification System|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SIC codes can be grouped into progressively broader industry classifications: industry group, major group, and division. The first 3 digits of the SIC code indicate the industry group, and the first two digits indicate the major group. Each division encompasses a range of SIC codes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sic_manual.html|title=SIC Division Structure|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehso.com/siccodes.php|title=The Entire SIC Code Listing - Free from EHSO|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To look at a particular example of the hierarchy, SIC code 2024 (ice cream and frozen desserts) belongs to industry group 202 (dairy products), which is part of major group 20 (food and kindred products), which belongs to the division of manufacturing.

==Purpose==
In the early 1900s, each branch of a United States government agency would conduct business analysis using its own methods and metrics, unknown and meaningless to other branches. In the 1930s, the government needed standardized and meaningful ways in which to measure, analyze and share data across its various agencies. Thus, the Standard Industrial Classification system was born. SIC codes are four-digit numerical representations of major businesses and industries. SIC codes are assigned based on common characteristics shared in the products, services, production and delivery system of a business.

==Structure== 
SIC codes have a hierarchical, top-down structure that begins with general characteristics and narrows down to the specifics. The first two digits of the code represent the major industry sector to which a business belongs. The third and fourth digits describe the sub-classification of the business group and specialization, respectively. For example, "36" refers to a business that deals in "Electronic and Other Equipment." Adding "7" as a third digit to get "367" indicates that the business operates in "Electronic, Component and Accessories." The fourth digit distinguishes the specific industry sector, so a code of "3672" indicates that the business is concerned with "Printed Circuit Boards."

==Uses==
The [[U.S. Census Bureau]], [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], [[Internal Revenue Service]] and [[Social Security Administration]] utilize SIC codes in their reporting, although SIC codes are also used in academic and business sectors. The Bureau of Labor Statistics updates the codes every three years and uses SIC to report on work force, wages and pricing issues. The Social Security Administration assigns SIC codes to businesses based on the descriptions provided by employers under the primary business activity entry on employer ID applications.

==Limitations==
Over the years, the U.S. Census has identified three major limitations to using the SIC system. The first limitation surrounds its definition and mistaken classification of employee groups. For example, administrative assistants in the automotive industry support all levels of the business, yet the SIC defines these employees as part of the "Basic Sector" of manufacturing jobs when they should be reported as "Non-Basic." Secondly, SIC codes were developed for traditional industries prior to 1970. Business has changed considerably since then from manufacturing-based to mostly service-based. As a result, and thirdly the SIC has been slow to recognize new and emerging industries, such as those in the technology sector.

==History of the change to NAICS==
The [[Office of Management and Budget]], or OMB, was tasked with revising the SIC system to reflect changing economic conditions. The OMB established the [[Economic Classification Policy Committee]] in 1992 to develop a new system representative of the current industrial climate. The result was the [[North American Industrial Classification System]], or NAICS, a collaborative effort between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. NAICS expanded the four-digit SIC code to a six-digit code, and it provided more flexibility in handling emerging industries. The new code was implemented in Canada and the United States in 1997 and in Mexico one year later.

==List of codes==
The following table is from the SEC's website, which allows searching for companies by SIC code in its database of filings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/siccodes.htm|title=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SIC Code List|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acronym NEC stands for "not elsewhere classified".

A '''''Stichting''''' (foundation) is a Dutch legal entity with [[limited liability]], but no members or share capital, that exists for a specific purpose.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.step.org/dutch-foundation&lt;/ref&gt; This form of entity makes it possible to separate functions of ownership and control.  Its use has been pioneered successfully in recent years as a 'poison pill' style defence tactic in hostile takeover situations by Scott V Simpson, one of Europe's leading mergers and acquisitions lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;The Wall Street Journal 'Going Dutch Has New Meaning In Corporate Takeover Battles' May 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
A Stichting is a legal person created through a legal act. This act is usually either a notarised deed (or a will) that contains the articles of the foundation which must include the first appointed board. No government authority is involved in the creation or authorization of a foundation. It acquires full legal capacity through its sole creation. A foundation has no members and its purpose must be stated in its articles, using capital dedicated to such goal. The foundations are defined in the Dutch Civil Code ([[Burgerlijk Wetboek]]), Boek 2 Art 285-304. It is not necessary in the Netherlands that a foundation serves a purpose of general interest, but its official goal cannot include making payments to anybody, except for charitable causes. A foundation is governed and represented by a board that is responsible for the foundation's administration. The board does not have a requirement for specific number of members.

Art. 2:289 of the Civil Code establishes that all foundations must be registered in the Register of Commerce or "Kamer van Koophandel". Commercial activities are allowed if they are within the purpose of the foundation and are taxed. Board members can be held liable for the foundation, civilly as well as criminally.

The Dutch Tax Service can declare an institution to be an "institution for general benefit" ([[algemeen nut beogende instelling|ANBI]]), with tax benefits. Often, but not necessarily, this is a foundation. Conversely, not every foundation  qualifies.

==Examples==

===Charitable organizations===
*[[Cornelis Kruseman Stichting]] – purpose: bring the work of painter [[Cornelis Kruseman]] (1797–1857) to the attention of the public.
*[[Museumkaart|Stichting Museumjaarkaart]] – purpose: promote visits to Dutch museums.
*[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting]] – purpose: make news and sports programmes for the three Dutch public television channels and the Dutch public radio services.
*[[P2P Foundation]] that promotes peer to peer networking and action research.
*[[FERN|Stichting FERN]] – purpose: promote greater environmental and social justice, focusing on forests and forest peoples’ rights.
*[[Stichting INGKA Foundation]] – purpose: promote and support innovation in the field of architectural and interior design.
*[[Stichting Max Havelaar]] – purpose: the Dutch member of Fairtrade International.
*[[Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP]] – pension fund for the government and educational sectors.
*[[Stichting Pensioenfonds Zorg en Welzijn]] – pension fund for the healthcare and social work sectors.
*[[Wiardi Beckman Stichting]] – purpose: a think tank linked to the Labour Party ([[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]]).
*[[Mars One]] – purpose: establish a permanent human colony on Mars.
*[[MINIX 3]] – Stichting MINIX Research Foundation - purpose: Support and develop Minix3 Operating System.

===Takeover defense===
Stichting are used as a type of [[poison pill]] (takeover defense mechanism) for publicly traded companies. In one case, the Dutch-incorporated pharmaceutical company [[Mylan]] established a stichting for the purpose of "safeguarding Mylan’s strategy, mission and independence" and gave the stichting the right to veto any proposed [[hostile takeover]] of Mylan.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Raice|first1=Shayndi|title=The Rise of the ‘Stichting,’ an Obscure Takeover Defense|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-rise-of-the-stichting-an-obscure-takeover-defense-1429716204|accessdate=28 July 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|date=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stichting was activated in July 2015 to block a planned takeover by [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Raice|first1=Shayndi|title=Mylan’s Leverage to Resist Teva Deal Reveals Shift in Rules|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/mylans-leverage-to-resist-teva-deal-reveals-shift-in-rules-1438029585?tesla=y|accessdate=28 July 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|date=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finance and investment===
Stichting are used by institutional investors, such as banks and wealthy individuals, as a means of controlling assets while not having legal ownership or consolidating the assets on their financial statements. The properties of stichting can be used to avoid [[inheritance tax]], [[trade sanctions]] and [[expropriation]]. In one case, the Libyan-based oil company [[Oilinvest]] used a stichting structure to avoid sanctions on Libya and ensure its continued operation following the overthrow of [[Muammar Gaddafi]]; in another case, the Russian oil company [[Yukos]] used a stichting structure in an attempt to shield its assets from tax claims by the Russian government.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt;

==Netherlands Antilles==
Foundation legislation was last reformed in 1998, giving rise to the [[Netherlands Antilles]] Private Foundation (Stichting Particulier Fonds).

[[File:Andrew Carnegie by Francis Luis Mora..jpg|thumb|''Andrew Carnegie'' by Francis Luis Mora]]

'''''The Empire of Business''''' is a collection of essays written by [[Scottish-American]] industrialist [[Andrew Carnegie]] which were published in book form in 1902.

The book shares his shrewd outlook on the economic situation in America at the turn of the 20th century; Carnegie discusses the rewards of hard work, integrity, frugality and other prudent qualities such as the "bugaboo of trusts" that he believes every person should possess if they wish to achieve success in their lifetime. Topics include the state of the oil and steel industries within the United States and the best uses of tariffs.

The essays that form the book have been gathered from a number of well received publications from the era, these include the ''[[New York Evening Post]]'', the ''[[New York Journal]]'' and ''[[Macmillan's Magazine]]''. ''The Empire of Business'' provides the reader with an insight into one of history’s most notable entrepreneurs. Andrew Carnegie is also often described as the most prominent philanthropist in history.

'''Total shareholder return''' ('''TSR''') (or simply '''total return''') is a [[Measurement|measure]] of the performance of different companies' [[stocks]] and [[shares]] over time. It combines [[share price]] appreciation and [[dividends]] paid to show the total return to the [[shareholder]] expressed as an annualized percentage. It is calculated by the growth in capital from purchasing a share in the company assuming that the dividends are [[reinvested]] each time they are paid. This growth is expressed as a percentage as the [[compound annual growth rate]].

The main benefit of TSR is that it allows the performance of shares to be compared even though some of the shares may have a high growth and low dividends and others may have low growth and high dividends.

Most [[Stock market index|stock market indices]] only use the growth of the prices of the companies making up the index. However, when they use TSR for the companies it is called a [[total return index]] or accumulation index. For example, corresponding to the [[S&amp;P 500]] index calculated by [[Standard and Poor's]], there is the S&amp;P 500 TR index.

In the technology sector, a study has found that regardless of a company's size, the more diverse the portfolio, the more difficult it is to generate high TSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DiGrande|first1=Sebastian|last2=Zajac|first2=Jason|last3=Nolan|first3=Tim|last4=Borno|first4=Ruba|title=Break Up of Shake Up: Get Ready for the Technology Industry Revolution|url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/break-or-shake-get-ready-technology-industry-revolution|publisher=Transaction Advisors|ISSN=2329-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice TSR is difficult to calculate since it involves knowing the price of the shares at the time the dividends are paid. However, as an approximation over one year it can be calculated as follows with:
 
&lt;math&gt;Price_{begin}&lt;/math&gt; = share price at beginning of year,
 
&lt;math&gt;Price_{end}&lt;/math&gt; = share price at end of year,
 
''Dividends'' = dividends paid over year and

''TSR'' = total shareholder return, TSR is computed as

&lt;math&gt;
TSR={(Price_{end} - Price_{begin} + Dividends)}/{Price_{begin}}&lt;/math&gt;

{{slavery}}
'''Unfree labour''' is a generic or collective term for those work relations, especially in [[modern history|modern]] or [[Early Modern period|early modern]] history, in which people are employed against their will with the threat of [[poverty|destitution]], [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]], [[violence]] (including death), [[wiktionary:compulsion|compulsion]],&lt;ref&gt;[[forced labour under German rule during World War II]] through [[Service du travail obligatoire]] of [[Vichy France]]&lt;/ref&gt; or other forms of extreme hardship to themselves or members of their families.

Unfree labour includes all forms of [[slavery]], and related institutions (e.g. [[debt bondage|debt slavery]], [[serfdom]], [[corvée]] and [[labor camp|labour camps]]). Many of these forms of work may be covered by the term '''forced labour''', which is defined by the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) as all involuntary work or service exacted under the menace of a penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Andrees and Belser, "Forced labor: Coercion and exploitation in the private economy", 2009. Rienner and ILO.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, under the [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] [[Forced Labour Convention]] of 1930, the term forced or compulsory labour shall not include:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C029&lt;/ref&gt;
*any work or service exacted in virtue of [[conscription|compulsory military service]] laws for work of a purely military character;
*any work or service which forms part of the normal [[civic obligations]] of the citizens of a fully [[self-governing]] country;
*any work or service exacted from any person as a consequence of a conviction in a [[court of law]], provided that the said work or service is carried out under the supervision and control of a [[public authority]] and that the said person is not hired to or [[private prison|placed at the disposal of private individuals, companies or associations]] (requiring that [[prison farm]]s no longer do [[convict lease|convict leasing]]);
*any work or service exacted in cases of emergency, that is to say, in the event of [[war]], of a [[Disaster|calamity]] or threatened calamity, such as [[fire]], [[flood]], [[famine]], [[earthquake]], [[violent epidemic]] or [[epizootic diseases]], invasion by: [[animal]], [[insect]] or [[vegetable pests]], and in general any circumstance that would endanger the existence or the well-being of the whole or part of the population;
*minor communal services of a kind which, being performed by the members of the community in the direct interest of the said community, can therefore be considered as normal civic obligations incumbent upon the members of the community, provided that the members of the community or their direct representatives shall have the right to be consulted in regard to the need for such services.

==Payment for unfree labour==
{{see also|Labour economics#Wage slavery|Labor theory of value|Productive and unproductive labour}}
[[File:Convict labourers in Australia in the early 20th century.jpg|thumb|Convict labourers in Australia in the early 20th century.]]
If payment occurs, it may be in one or more of the following forms:
* The payment does not exceed [[subsistence]] or barely exceeds it;
* The payment is in goods which are not desirable and/or cannot be exchanged or are difficult to exchange; or
* The payment wholly or mostly consists of cancellation of a debt or liability that was itself coerced, or belongs to someone else.

Unfree labour is often more easily instituted and enforced on migrant workers, who have traveled far from their homelands and who are easily identified because of their physical, ethnic, linguistic, or cultural differences from the general population, since they are unable or unlikely to report their conditions to the authorities.

According to the [[Marxian economics]], under [[capitalism]], workers never keep all of the wealth they create, as some of it goes to the [[Profit (economics)|profit]] of capitalists. By contrast with modern [[subjective theory of value]] (as used by [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical economists]]), the wages offered necessarily represent the [[marginal utility]] of the labour, and any profit (or loss) is also due to other inputs provided, such as [[capital (economics)|capital]], [[interest|time value of money]], or risk.

==The present situation==
Unfree labor re-emerged as an issue in the debate about rural development during the years following the end of the 1939–45 war, when a political concern of Keynesian theory was not just [[economic reconstruction]] (mainly in Europe and Asia) but also planning (in the Third World). A crucial aspect of the ensuing discussion concerned the extent to which different relational forms constituted obstacles to capitalist development, and why.

During the 1960s and 1970s unfree labor was regarded as incompatible with capitalist accumulation, and thus an obstacle to economic growth, an interpretation advanced by exponents of the then-dominant semi-feudal thesis. From the 1980s onwards, however, another and very different Marxist view emerged, arguing that evidence from Latin America and India suggested agribusiness enterprises, commercial farmers and rich peasants reproduced, introduced or reintroduced unfree relations.

However, recent contributions to this debate have attempted to exclude Marxism from the discussion. These contributions maintain that, because Marxist theory failed to understand the centrality of unfreedom to modern capitalism, a new explanation of this link is needed. This claim has been questioned by [[Tom Brass]] (2014), ‘Debating Capitalist Dynamics and Unfree Labour: A Missing Link?’, The Journal of Development Studies, 50:4, 570–82. He argues that many of these new characteristics are in fact no different from those identified earlier by Marxist theory and that the exclusion of the latter approach from the debate is thus unwarranted.

The [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) estimates that at least 12.3 million people are victims of forced labour worldwide; of these, 9.8 million are exploited by private agents and more than 2.4 million are [[human trafficking|trafficked]]. Other 2.5 million are forced to work by the state or by rebel military groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/subjects-covered-by-international-labour-standards/forced-labour/lang--en/index.htm |title=Forced labour |publisher=Ilo.org |date=2013-02-15 |accessdate=2013-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childcentre.info/projects/traffickin/dbaFile14058.pdf Trafficking for Forced Labour in Europe—Report on a study in the UK, Ireland the Czech Republic and Portugal.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113080105/http://www.childcentre.info/projects/traffickin/dbaFile14058.pdf |date=2012-01-13 }} November, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; From an [[international law]] perspective, countries that allow forced labor are violating [[international labour standards]] as set forth in the Abolition of Forced Labour Convention (C105), one of the fundamental conventions of the ILO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 (No. 105)|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO:12100:P12100_ILO_CODE:C105|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Global Slavery Index}}

According to the ''ILO Special Action Programme to Combat Forced Labour'' (SAP-FL), global profits from forced trafficked labour exploited by private agents are estimated at US$44,3 billion per year. About 70% of this value (US$31.6 billion) come from trafficked victims. At least the half of this sum (more than US$15 billion) comes from industrialized countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/sapfl/Informationresources/ILOPublications/lang--en/docName--WCMS_081971/index.htm Forced Labour and Human trafficking: Estimating the Profits].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trafficking==
{{main|Human trafficking}}

Trafficking is a term to define the recruiting, harbouring, obtaining and transportation of a person by use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjecting them to involuntary acts, such as acts related to commercial sexual exploitation (including [[forced prostitution]]) or involuntary labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Human Trafficking?|url=https://www.dhs.gov/blue-campaign/what-human-trafficking|website=Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms==
===Slavery===
{{main|Slavery}}
The [[archetype|archetypal]] and best-known form of unfree labour is [[slavery|chattel slavery]], in which individual workers are ''legally'' owned throughout their lives, and may be bought, sold or otherwise exchanged by owners, while never or rarely receiving any personal benefit from their labour. Slavery was common in many [[Ancient history|ancient societies]], including [[Slavery in ancient Egypt|ancient Egypt]], [[Babylon]], [[History of Iran|Persia]], [[Slavery in ancient Greece|ancient Greece]], [[Slavery in ancient Rome|Rome]], [[ancient Israel]], [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], [[Arab slave trade|classical Arab states]], as well as many societies in [[Africa]] and [[Americas|the Americas]]. Being sold into slavery was a common fate of populations conquered in wars. Perhaps the most prominent example of chattel slavery was the enslavement of many millions of [[black people]] in Africa, as well as their forced transplantation to the Americas, Asia or, in much smaller numbers, Europe,  where their status as slaves was usually inherited by their descendants.

The term ''slavery'' is often applied to situations which do not meet the above definitions, but which are other, closely related forms of unfree labour, such as [[debt slavery]] or debt-bondage (although not all repayment of debts through labour constitutes unfree labour). Examples are the [[Repartimiento]] system in the [[Spanish Empire]], or the work of [[Indigenous Australians]] in [[northern Australia]] on sheep or cattle ''stations'' ([[ranch]]es), from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century. In the latter case, workers were rarely or never paid, and were restricted by regulations and/or police intervention to regions around their places of work.

In late 16th century Japan, "unfree labour" or slavery was officially banned; but forms of contract and indentured labour persisted alongside the period penal codes' forced labour. Somewhat later, the [[Edo period]] penal laws prescribed "non-free labour" for the immediate family of executed criminals in Article 17 of the ''Gotōke reijō'' (Tokugawa House Laws), but the practice never became common. The 1711 ''Gotōke reijō'' was compiled from over 600 statutes promulgated between 1597 and 1696.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James Bryant. (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=0YIbNlliRswC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=hideyoshi+slavery&amp;source=web&amp;ots=9P9o262Fpo&amp;sig=TKN79q0hnoLMEP8UbZk2fdmq00I&amp;hl=en#PPA31,M1 ''Frontier Contact Between Choson Korea and Tokugawa Japan,'' pp. 31–32.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Kevin Bales]], in ''[[Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global Economy]]'' (1999), there are now an estimated 27 million slaves in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Pubs/chronicle/2005/issue3/0305p28.html |title=Slavery in the Twenty-First Century |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2010401.stm |title=Millions 'forced into slavery' |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2002-05-27 |accessdate=2013-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Global Slavery Index}}

===Truck system===
{{main|Truck system}}
A truck system, in the specific sense in which the term is used by [[Labor history (discipline)|labour historians]], refers to an unpopular or even exploitative form of payment associated with small, isolated and/or rural communities, in which workers or [[self-employed]] small producers are paid in either: goods, a form of payment known as [[truck system|truck wages]], or tokens, [[scrip|private currency]] ("scrip") or direct credit, to be used at a '''company store''', owned by their employers. A specific kind of truck system, in which credit advances are made against future work, is known in the U.S. as [[debt bondage]].

Many scholars have suggested that employers use such systems to exploit workers and/or indebt them. This could occur, for example, if employers were able to pay workers with goods which had a market value below the level of [[subsistence]], or by selling items to workers at inflated prices. Others argue that truck wages, at least in some cases, were a convenient way for isolated communities to operate, when official currency was scarce.{{Citation needed|reason=When?|date=April 2018}}

By the early 20th century, truck systems were widely seen, in [[industrialisation|industrialised]] countries, as exploitative; perhaps the most well-known example of this view was a 1947 U.S. hit song "[[Sixteen Tons]]". Many countries have [[Truck Act]] legislation that outlaws truck systems and requires payment in cash.

===Mandatory services due to social status===
====Corvée====
{{main|Corvée|Socage}}
Though most closely associated with [[Medieval]] Europe, governments throughout human history have imposed regular short stints of unpaid labor upon lower social classes.  These might be annual obligations of a few weeks or something similarly regular that lasted for the laborer's entire working life.  As the system developed in the Philippines and elsewhere, the laborer could pay an appropriate fee and be exempted from the obligation.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

====Vetti-chakiri====
{{main|Veth (India)}}
In '''Vetti-chakiri''' and '''begar''' lower castes have only had obligations or duties to render free services to the upper caste community also called as Vetti or Vetti chakiri.&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eastwestcenter.org%2Ffileadmin%2Fstored%2Fpdfs%2Fewcwwp013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=June 2014}}

===Conscription===
====Conscription for military and security forces====
{{main|Conscription|Impressment}}
Beside the conscription for [[Conscription#By country|military]] services, some countries draft citizens for [[paramilitary]] or [[Internal security|security forces]], like [[Internal Troops|internal troops]], [[Border Guard|border guards]] or [[Police|police forces]]. While sometimes paid, conscripts are not free to decline enlistment. [[Draft dodging]] or [[desertion]] are often met with severe punishment. Even in countries which prohibit other forms of unfree labour, conscription is generally justified as being necessary in the [[nationalism|national interest]] and therefore it is not contrary to the exceptions of the [[Forced Labour Convention]], signed by the most countries in the world.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==== Conscription for community services and fire services ====
During the [[Cold War]] in some [[communist]] countries like [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic | Czechoslovakia]], the [[East Germany | German Democratic Republic]] or the [[Soviet Union]] the originally voluntary work on saturday for the community called ''[[Subbotnik]]'', ''Voskresnik'' or  ''[[Action Z | Akce Z]]'' became ''de facto'' oblitatory for the members of a community. 

In theory in some [[States of Germany|German states]] it is feasible for communities to draft citizens for public services, called [[Hand and Tension Services]]. This mandatory service has not been executed since [[World War II]], if at all, this obligatory service only will be executed during or after a severe disaster. &lt;ref&gt;https://dejure.org/gesetze/GemO/10.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_12.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Switzerland]] in most communities all inhabitants, no matter if they are Swiss or not, have to join the so called ''Militia Fire Brigades''.
Conscripts in [[Singapore]] are providing the personnel of the country´s fire service as part of the [[National service in Singapore|national service]] in the [[Singapore Civil Defence Force | Civil Defence Force]]. 
In [[Austria]] and [[Germany]] citizens have to join a [[Compulsory Fire Service | compulsory fire brigade]] if a [[Volunteer fire department | volunteer fire service]] can not be provided, due to lack of volunteers. In 2018 this regulation is executed only in a handful of communities in Germany and currently in none community in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shz.de/lokales/husumer-nachrichten/pflicht-feuerwehr-fuer-friedrichstadt-id13322331.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swissfire.ch/fileadmin/swissfire/Der%20SFV/Factsheet_Feuerwehr_2015_d.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civil Conscription====
{{main|Civil mobilization|Civil conscription}}
Some countries practice forms of conscription for public works for different occupational groups or groups of people under different denominations like ''[[civil conscription]]'', ''[[civil mobilization]]'', ''political mobilisation'' etc. In history this obligatory services have been implemented due to long-lasting [[Strike action | labour strikes]] or economic crisis, to provide basic services like medical care or food supply. In [[Australia]] discussions about implementing civil conscription for unemployed persons were held during an election campaign in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-61025819/civil-conscription-or-reciprocal-obligation-the-ethics&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Belgium]] in 1964, in [[Portugal]] and in [[Greece]] from 2010 to 2014 due to the severe [[Greek government-debt crisis|economic crisis]], a system of civil mobilization was implemented to provide public services as a national interest. In Greece these obligatory services have been called ''political mobilization''{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}) and ''civil conscription''.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/efemiredictionary/civil-conscription-0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/greek/news/020822_nautergates.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2013/05/11/greek-govt-to-issue-86000-civil-mobilization-orders-for-teachers-before-the-strike/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stopcartel.org/civil-mobilization/&lt;/ref&gt;

Another historically significant example of forced labour was that of [[political prisoner]]s, people from conquered or occupied countries, members of persecuted minorities, and [[prisoners of war]], especially during the 20th century. The best-known example of this are the [[concentration camp]] system run by [[Nazi Germany]] in Europe during World War II, the ''[[Gulag]]'' camps&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/249117/Gulag Gulag], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; run by the [[Soviet Union]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/getman_paintings.php?painting_id=22 The Gulag Collection: Paintings of Nikolai Getman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031012238/http://www.jamestown.org/getman_paintings.php?painting_id=22 |date=2007-10-31 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the forced labour used by the military of the [[Empire of Japan]], especially during the [[Pacific War]] (such as the [[Burma Railway]]). Roughly 4,000,000 German POWs were used as "reparations labour" by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] for several years after the German surrender; this was permitted under the Third Geneva Convention provided they were accorded proper treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t297a01.html |title=The original memorandum from 1944, signed by Morgenthau |publisher=Fdrlibrary.marist.edu |date=2004-05-27 |accessdate=2013-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; China's ''[[Laogai]]'' ("labour reform") system and [[North Korea]]'s [[Kwalliso]] camps are current examples.

About 12 million forced labourers, most of whom were Poles and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] citizens ''([[Ost-Arbeiter]])'', were employed in the German war economy inside [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1757323,00.html |title=Final Compensation Pending for Former Nazi Forced Laborers |publisher=Dw-world.de |date= |accessdate=2013-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html Forced Labor at Ford Werke AG during the Second World War] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014235036/http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html |date=October 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 2000 German companies profited from slave labour during the Nazi era, including [[Daimler-Benz|Daimler]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Siemens]], [[Volkswagen]], [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]], [[Dresdner Bank]], [[Krupp]], [[Allianz]], [[BASF]], [[Bayer]], [[BMW]], and [[Degussa]].&lt;ref&gt;American Jewish Committee (2000).

In Asia, according to a joint study of historians featuring Zhifen Ju, [[Mark Peattie]], Toru Kubo, and Mitsuyoshi Himeta, more than 10 million Chinese were mobilized by the Japanese army and [[History of slavery#Japan|enslaved]] by the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere#The Kōa-in|Kōa-in]] for [[Slavery|slave labour]] in [[Manchukuo]] and north China.&lt;ref&gt;Zhifen Ju, "Japan's atrocities of conscripting and abusing north China draftees after the outbreak of the Pacific war", 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Library of Congress estimates that in [[Java]], between 4 and 10 million ''[[romusha]]'' (Japanese: "manual laborer") were forced to work by the Japanese military. About 270,000 of these Javanese laborers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in South East Asia. Only 52,000 were repatriated to Java, meaning that there was a death rate of 80%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+id0029) Library of Congress, 1992, "Indonesia: World War II and the Struggle For Independence, 1942–50; The Japanese Occupation, 1942–45"] Access date: February 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Khmer Rouge]] attempted to turn Cambodia into a [[classless society]] by depopulating cities and forcing the urban population ("New People") into agricultural [[collective farming|communes]]. The entire population was forced to become farmers in [[labor camp|labour camps]].

====Prison labour====

[[File:Modern chain gang.jpg|right|thumb|American prisoner "[[chain gang]]" laborers, 2006. Notice the shackles on the feet of the prisoners.]]
[[Convict]] or prison labour is another classic form of unfree labour. The forced labour of convicts has often been regarded with lack of sympathy, because of the [[social stigma]] attached to people regarded as "common criminals". In some countries and historical periods, however, prison labour has been forced upon people who have been victims of prejudice, convicted of political crimes, convicted of "[[victimless crime]]s", or people who committed theft or related offences because they lacked any other means of subsistence—categories of people who typically call for [[compassion]] according to current ethical ideas.

Three British [[colony|colonies]] in Australia—New South Wales, Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) and Western Australia—are three examples of the state use of convict labour.  Australia received thousands of convict labourers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries who were given sentences for crimes ranging from those now considered to be minor misdemeanors to such serious offences as murder, rape and incest.  A considerable number of Irish convicts were sentenced to transportation for 'treason' while fighting for Irish independence from British rule.

More than 165,000 convicts were transported to Australian colonies from 1788 to 1868.&lt;ref&gt;[http://landing.ancestry.co.uk/intl/au/convict/ Convict Records], Ancestry.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Most British or Irish convicts who were sentenced to transportation, however, completed their sentences in British jails and were not transported at all.

It is estimated that in the last 50 years more than 50 million people have been sent to Chinese ''[[laogai]]'' camps.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Aaron (October 5, 2005).

===Indentured and bonded labour===
{{main|Indenture|bonded labour}}

A more common form in modern society is indenture, or ''bonded labour'', under which workers sign contracts to work for a specific period of time, for which they are paid only with accommodation and sustenance, or these essentials in addition to limited benefits such as cancellation of a debt, or transportation to a desired country.

{{TOC limit}}

==History==

===Early formative years===
The company was incorporated on 29 December 1945 in Amalner, Maharashtra by Mohamed Premji as "Western India Vegetable Products Limited", later abbreviated to "Wipro". It was initially set up as a manufacturer of vegetable and [[cooking oil#Refinement|refined oils]] in [[Amalner]], Maharashtra, India under the [[trade name]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of Kisan, Sunflower, and Camel.&lt;ref name=NPHistory/&gt;&lt;ref name="moneycontrol-wipro-history"/&gt;&lt;ref name="companyhistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipro.com/about-Wipro/|title="About Wipro"|website=wipro.com|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, after Mohamed Premji's death, his son [[Azim Premji]] returned home from [[Stanford University]] and took over Wipro as its [[chairman]] at the age of 21.&lt;ref name="Billionaire Profile: Azim Premji"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Financial Express"/&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s, the company shifted its focus to new business opportunities in the IT and computing industry, which was at a nascent stage in India at the time. On 7 June 1977, the name of the company changed from Western India Vegetable Products Limited, to Wipro Products Limited.&lt;ref name="moneycontrol-wipro-history"/&gt;

The year 1980 marked the arrival of Wipro in the IT domain. In 1982, the name was changed from Wipro Products Limited to Wipro Limited.&lt;ref name="Company profile for Wipro"/&gt; Meanwhile, Wipro continued to expand in the consumer products domain with the launch of "Ralak" a [[Tulsi]] based family soap and "Wipro Jasmine", a toilet soap. In 1988  Premji took a loan of 1 million dollars from Sonkar and Sons to set up the project. Later the entire loan amount was waived.&lt;ref name="moneycontrol-wipro-history"/&gt;

===1986–1992===
In 1988, Wipro diversified its product line into heavy-duty industrial cylinders and mobile hydraulic cylinders.&lt;ref name="moneycontrol-wipro-history"/&gt; A joint venture company with the United States' [[General Electric]] in the name of Wipro GE Medical Systems Pvt. Ltd. was set up in 1989 for the manufacture, sales, and service of diagnostic and imaging products.&lt;ref name="economictimes-wipro-history"/&gt; Later, in 1991, tipping systems and Eaton hydraulic products were launched. The Wipro Fluid Power division, in 1992, developed expertise to offer standard hydraulic cylinders for construction equipment and truck tipping systems. The market saw the launch of the "Santoor" talcum powder and "Wipro Baby Soft" range of baby toiletries in 1990.&lt;ref name="economictimes-wipro-history"/&gt;

===1994–2000===
In 1995, Wipro set up an overseas design centre, Odyssey 21, for undertaking projects and product developments in advanced technologies for overseas clients. Wipro Infotech and Wipro Systems were amalgamated with Wipro in April that year.&lt;ref name="economictimes-wipro-history"/&gt; Five of Wipro's manufacturing and development facilities secured the ISO 9001 certification during 1994–95. In 1999, Wipro acquired Wipro Acer.&lt;ref name="Corporate Round-up"/&gt; Wipro became a more profitable, diversified corporation with new products such as the Wipro SuperGenius personal computers (PCs). In 1999, the product was the one Indian PC range to obtain US-based National Software Testing Laboratory ([[National Software Testing Laboratories|NSTL]]) certification for the Year 2000 ([[Y2K]]) compliance in hardware for all models.&lt;ref name="In brief"/&gt;

[[File:YoungGuns International Award Logo.tif|thumb|YoungGuns International Award Logo]]

'''YoungGuns International Award''' (also referenced as '''YoungGuns Award''' and '''YGAward''') is an annual global award show for young and emerging creative talent in the advertising and communication industry. The award recognizes the best young commercial practitioners and students across the fields of [[advertising]], [[communication design]], digital creative, [[advertising media]] and [[public relations]] from around the world. Entrants into the award must be aged 30 or under.

Entrants for the award compete for gold, silver and bronze awards across 8 divisions and 40 categories.&lt;ref name=bnt_1 /&gt; Every year, two ultimate winners will be determined and named YoungGun of the Year and YoungGun Student of the Year.

== History ==
Kristian Barnes, Jason Williams, and Michael Kean (CEO of market-leading global creative recruitment firm FBI Recruitment) founded the YoungGuns Award in 2001 from [[Sydney, Australia]] with the goal of recognizing and promoting upcoming talent rather than rewarding years of experience. They noted that the reason for starting the award was their frustration that major awards at the time were typically won by well established individuals within the industry.&lt;ref name="bnt_1"&gt;[http://www.bandt.com.au/news/aussie-young-guns-take-on-the-world "Aussie Young Guns Take on the World"], BNT, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Call for entry ==
YoungGuns was the first international award to produce an advertising campaign for its call of entries. The campaigns are renowned for being controversial. Most notable include "Peak Early" which focused on child prodigies&lt;ref name="creative1"&gt;[http://creativity-online.com/news/young-guns-encourages-creatives-to-peak-early/35509 "Young Guns Encourages Creatives to 'Peak Early'"], Creativity Online 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and "Quit in Style" which allowed anyone to upload content such as videos and feedback to demonstrate how they would quit their jobs.&lt;ref name="campbrief"&gt;[http://www.campaignbrief.com/2008/08/young-guns-quit-in-style-with.html "Young Guns Quit In Style With DROGA5"], Campaign Brief, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the controversy the yearly campaigns have proven to be quite appealing to the creative industry. Some campaigns have managed to receive recognition in other creative awards such as the New Zealand Grande Axis&lt;ref name="caanz"&gt;[http://www.caanz.co.nz/ma_awards.php?ssearch=ssearch&amp;pid=18&amp;sub=0&amp;nd=&amp;simple_agency=&amp;simple_client=Young+Guns&amp;ssearch=ssearch&amp;submitBtn.x=55&amp;submitBtn.y=22&amp;submitBtn=searching CAANZ Award Winner Listings: Young Guns]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival]].

The call for entries campaigns are usually created by selective advertising agencies or creative collaborations from all around the world. Some of the past Call for Entry campaign creators included [[Droga5]], The Glue Society, [[TAXI (advertising agency)|Taxi]], [[Crispin, Porter + Bogusky]] and [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]] (New Zealand).
