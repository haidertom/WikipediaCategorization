'''''Artibus Asiae''''' is a biannual [[academic journal]] specialising in the [[art]]s and [[archaeology]] of Asia. Along with the ''[[Ostasiatische Zeitschrift]]'' (founded in 1912) it was one of the most successful journals in its field in the German-speaking part of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;See Walravens, Hartmut, ''Ostasiatische Zeitschrift (1912–1943), Mitteilungen der Gesellschaft für Ostasiatische Kunst (1926-1943): Bibliographie und Register'', Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden, 2000, XII.&lt;/ref&gt; The first number of ''Artibus Asiae'' appeared in 1925. While earlier issues contained articles in German, French and English, today's contributions are mainly in English. ''Artibus Asiae'' is owned and published by the [[Museum Rietberg]] in [[Zurich]]. ''Artibus Asiae'' also published occasional monographs since 1937.

== History ==
The first volume of the journal was published by the Avalun-Verlag Hellerau-Dresden in 1925 and was edited by Carl Hentze (1883–1975) and Alfred Salmony (1890–1958).&lt;ref&gt;For a biography of Salmony see Walravens, Hartmut, "Salmony, Alfred". In: ''Neue Deutsche Biographie'', Band 22, Duncker &amp; Humblot, Berlin, 2005, 386-387. Salmonys editorial role is also mentioned in Li, Weijia, ''China und China-Erfahrung in Leben und Werk von Anna Seghers'', Lang Verlag, Bern, 2010, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The early volumes appeared in four issues each, up to vol. 59. All subsequent volumes were published in two parts. 

The typographer, publisher and later [[editor-in-chief]] Richard Hadl (1876–1944) had worked for the [[Leipzig]]-based publisher ''Drugulin'' as a director since 1922.&lt;ref&gt;''Artibus Asiae'', 1945 (vol. 8 no. 1), pp. i–iii.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Drugulin'' was one of the leading publishing houses and known for their wide array of unusual typesets. Hadl established his own publishing house, "Offizin Richard Hadl", in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Note: The first book in his publishing house was "Schriftproben der Offizin Richard Hadl", Berlin, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; and published five volumes of the journal ''Artibus Asiae''.&lt;ref&gt;"Artibus Asiae" vol. 3, no. 2-3 (1928–1929) was still published by the Avalun-Verlag, but already printed by the Offizin Richard Hadl. From vol. 3, no. 4 through vol. 8, no. 1, Hadl acted as editor-in-chief in Leipzig.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]] all publishing activities were moved to [[Switzerland]] and the journal would only appear irregularly.&lt;ref&gt;Volume 7 appeared in 1937, Volume 8 no. 1 was published in 1940 and Volume 8 no. 2-4 only in 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; Vol. 8 no. 1 was the first issue to be published in Switzerland, printed by the ''Kommissionsverlag Braus Riggenbach'' in [[Basel]]. All further volumes were published by ''Artibus Asiae'' in Ascona, where Hadl and his co-worker and publisher, Luise C. Tarabori-Flesch from [[Trier]] had settled in 1938/39. After Hadl had died in 1944,&lt;ref&gt;For Hadl's obituary see ''Artibus Asiae'', 1945 (vol. 8 no. 1), pp. i–iii&lt;/ref&gt; Miss Flesch kept the journal afloat on her own until 1946, when Alfred Salmony became editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;Waterbury, Florence, "Alfred Salmony: 1890-1958", in: ''Archives of the Chinese Art Society of America'', 1958 (vol. 12), 9. Lawton, Thomas, "Artibus Asiae Seventieth Anniversary," in: ''Artibus Asiae'', 1995 (vol. 55, no. 1-2), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Salmony edited the journal until his death in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Obituaries include https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/14/obituaries/alexander-soper-88-historian-of-asian-art.html; [[Gustav Ecke|Ecke, Gustav]], "In Memoriam Alfred Salmony", in: ''Ars Orientalis'' 1961 (vol. 4), 453; "Alfred Salmony (1890–1958)", in: ''College Art Journal'', 1958 (vol. 18, no. 1), 77 and Waterbury, Florence, in: ''Asian Perspectives'', 1958 (vol. 2 no. 1), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Artibus Asiae'''s link to the current owner, the [[Museum Rietberg]], was established through the museums's former director [[Elsy Leuzinger]], who edited an issue (vol. 20 no. 1, 1957) to commemorate the founding donor of the Museum Rietberg, [[Eduard von der Heydt]].&lt;ref&gt;An issue for von der Heydt's 70st{{Clarify|date=October 2013|reason=Should this be '70th', '71st' or something else? Subtraction from his birth date makes '80th' seem most likely.}} birthday was published in 1962 (vol. 25 no. 1).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 (from vol. 46 on), the [[Arthur M. Sackler]] Foundation started to sponsor the journal. The [[Museum Rietberg]] was granted a special publication endowment in 1991 (vol. 51) and it henceforth became the owner of both the journal and the monograph series.

== Artibus Asiae monographs ==
Longer articles submitted to ''Artibus Asiae'' were often split into parts and published in several numbers of the journal. ''Artibus Asiae'' started to publish monographs on selected topics in 1937 to allow more lengthy contributions to the field.&lt;ref&gt;For a list of published monographs, see http://www.artibusasiae.com/monographs/&lt;/ref&gt; They are conceived as a supplemental series to the journal and present a broad range of lavishly illustrated studies.  Early monographs were on topics only remotely related to the arts, such as publications on the Tibetan grammar books Sum cu pa and Rtags kyi ‘ajug&lt;ref&gt;Rol Pai Rdo Rje; Johannes Schubert, ''Tibetische Nationalgrammatik: Das Sum cu pa und Rtags kyi ‘ajug pa'', Artibus Asiae Supplementum vol. 1, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; or on Chinese literature.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram Eberhard, ''Die Chinesische Novelle des 17.-19. Jahrhunderts: Eine Soziologische Untersuchung'', Artibus Asiae Supplementum vol. 9, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A-SET Mind Controlled Wheelchair.jpg|thumb|Diwakar Vaish, an inventor of a brain-controlled wheelchair, during a press ceremony.]]

A '''brain–computer interface''' ('''BCI'''), sometimes called a '''neural-control interface''' ('''NCI'''), '''mind-machine interface''' ('''MMI'''), '''direct neural interface''' ('''DNI'''), or '''brain–machine interface''' ('''BMI'''), is a direct communication pathway between an enhanced or wired [[brain]] and an external device. BCI differs from [[Neuromodulation (medicine)|neuromodulation]] in that it allows for bidirectional information flow. BCIs are often directed at researching, mapping, assisting, augmenting, or repairing human cognitive or sensory-motor functions.&lt;ref name="Krucoff 584"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krucoff|first=Max O.|last2=Rahimpour|first2=Shervin|last3=Slutzky|first3=Marc W.|last4=Edgerton|first4=V.

Research on BCIs began in the 1970s at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) under a grant from the [[National Science Foundation]], followed by a contract from [[DARPA]].&lt;ref name="Vidal1"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=4583653|doi=10.1146/annurev.bb.02.060173.001105|year=1973|last1=Vidal|first1=JJ|title=Toward direct brain-computer communication|volume=2|pages=157–80|journal=Annual Review of Biophysics and Bioengineering|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vidal2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=J.

The field of BCI research and development has since focused primarily on neuroprosthetics applications that aim at restoring damaged hearing, sight and movement. Thanks to the remarkable [[neuroplasticity|cortical plasticity]] of the brain, signals from implanted prostheses can, after adaptation, be handled by the brain like natural sensor or effector channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10896180|year=2000|last1=Levine|first1=SP|last2=Huggins|first2=JE|last3=Bement|first3=SL|last4=Kushwaha|first4=RK|last5=Schuh|first5=LA|last6=Rohde|first6=MM|last7=Passaro|first7=EA|last8=Ross|first8=DA|last9=Elisevich|first9=KV|last10=Smith|first10=B.

Following years of animal experimentation, the first [[neuroprosthetic]] devices implanted in humans appeared in the mid-1990s.

==History==
The history of brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) starts with [[Hans Berger]]'s discovery of the electrical activity of the human brain and the development of [[electroencephalography]] (EEG). In 1924 Berger was the first to record human brain activity by means of EEG. Berger was able to identify [[neural oscillation|oscillatory activity]], such as Berger's wave or the [[alpha wave]] (8–13&amp;nbsp;Hz), by analyzing EEG traces.

Berger's first recording device was very rudimentary. He inserted [[silver]] wires under the scalps of his patients. These were later replaced by silver foils attached to the patient's head by rubber bandages. Berger connected these sensors to a [[Lippmann electrometer|Lippmann capillary electrometer]], with disappointing results. However, more sophisticated measuring devices, such as the [[Siemens]] double-coil recording [[galvanometer]], which displayed electric voltages as small as one ten thousandth of a volt, led to success.

Berger analyzed the interrelation of alternations in his EEG wave diagrams with [[Central nervous system disease|brain diseases]]. EEGs permitted completely new possibilities for the research of human brain activities.

Although the term had not yet been coined, one of the earliest examples of a working brain-machine interface was the piece ''Music for Solo Performer'' (1965) by the American composer [[Alvin Lucier]]. The piece makes use of EEG and analog signal processing hardware (filters, amplifiers, and a mixing board) to stimulate acoustic percussion instruments. To perform the piece one must produce [[alpha waves]] and thereby "play" the various percussion instruments via loudspeakers which are placed near or directly on the instruments themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1 = Volker Straebel |author2 = Wilm Thoben |title = Alvin Lucier's music for solo performer: experimental music beyond sonification |url= |journal = Organised Sound |volume = 19 |issue =1 |year = 2014 |pages = 17–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UCLA]] Professor Jacques Vidal coined the term "BCI" and produced the first peer-reviewed publications on this topic.&lt;ref name="Vidal1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vidal2"/&gt; Vidal is widely recognized as the inventor of BCIs in the BCI community, as reflected in  numerous peer-reviewed articles reviewing and discussing the field (e.g.,&lt;ref name="Wolpaw, J.R 2012"&gt;Wolpaw, J.R. and Wolpaw, E.W. (2012). "Brain-Computer Interfaces: Something New Under the Sun". In: ''Brain-Computer Interfaces: Principles and Practice'', Wolpaw, J.R. and Wolpaw (eds.), E.W. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wolpaw J.R. |author2=Birbaumer N. |author3=McFarland D.J. |author4=Pfurtscheller G. |author5=Vaughan T. M. | year = 2002 | title = Brain–computer interfaces for communication and control | url = | journal = Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 113 | issue = 6| pages = 767–791 | doi=10.1016/s1388-2457(02)00057-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Allison B.Z. |author2=Wolpaw E.W. |author3=Wolpaw J.R. | year = 2007 | title = Brain computer interface systems: Progress and prospects | journal = British Review of Medical Devices | volume = 4 | issue = 4| pages = 463–474 | doi=10.1586/17434440.4.4.463|pmid=17605682 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). His 1973 paper stated the "BCI challenge": Control of objects using EEG signals. Especially he pointed out to [[Contingent negative variation|Contingent Negative Variation (CNV)]] potential as a challenge for BCI control. The 1977 experiment Vidal described was the first application of BCI after his 1973 BCI challenge. It was a noninvasive EEG (actually Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP)) control of a cursor-like graphical object on a computer screen. The demonstration was movement in a maze.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~vidal/Real_Time_Detection.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

After his early contributions, Vidal was not active in BCI research, nor BCI events such as conferences, for many years. In 2011, however, he gave a lecture in [[Graz]], [[Austria]], supported by the Future BNCI project, presenting the first BCI, which earned a standing ovation. Vidal was joined by his wife, Laryce Vidal, who previously worked with him at UCLA on his first BCI project.

In 1988 report was given on noninvasive EEG control of a physical object, a robot. The experiment described was EEG control of multiple start-stop-restart of the robot movement, along an arbitrary trajectory defined by a line drawn on a floor. The line-following behavior was the default robot behavior, utilizing autonomous intelligence and autonomous source of energy.&lt;ref&gt;S. Bozinovski, M. Sestakov, L. Bozinovska: Using EEG alpha rhythm to control a mobile robot, In G. Harris, C. Walker (eds.) ''Proc. IEEE Annual Conference of Medical and Biological Society'', p. 1515-1516, New Orleans, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Bozinovski: Mobile robot trajectory control: From fixed rails to direct bioelectric control, In O. Kaynak (ed.) ''Proc. IEEE Workshop on Intelligent Motion Control'', p. 63-67, Istanbul, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 report was given on a  bidirectional adaptive BCI controlling computer buzzer by an anticipatory brain potential, the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) potential.&lt;ref&gt;L. Bozinovska, G. Stojanov, M. Sestakov, S. Bozinovski: CNV pattern recognition: step toward a cognitive wave observation, In L. Torres, E. Masgrau, E. Lagunas (eds.) Signal Processing V: Theories and Applications, Proc. EUSIPCO-90: Fifth European Signal Processing Conference, Elsevier, p. 1659-1662, Barcelona, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Bozinovska, S. Bozinovski, G. Stojanov, Electroexpectogram: experimental design and algorithms, In Proc IEEE International Biomedical Engineering Days, p. 55-60, Istanbul, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  The experiment described how an expectation state of the brain, manifested by CNV, controls in a feedback loop the S2 buzzer in the S1-S2-CNV paradigm. The obtained cognitive wave representing the expectation learning in the brain is named Electroexpectogram (EXG). The CNV brain potential was part of the BCI challenge presented by Vidal in his 1973 paper.

In 2015, the BCI Society] was officially launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bcisociety.org/|title=BCI Society Homepage|website=BCI society|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This non-profit organization is managed by an international board of BCI experts from different sectors (academia, industry, and medicine) with experience in different types of BCIs, such as invasive/non-invasive and control/non-control. The board is elected by the members of the Society, which has several hundred members. Among other responsibilities, the BCI Society organizes international meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bcisociety.org/meetings/bci-meeting-2016-past-meetings|title=BCI Meetings Past Meetings|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Versus neuroprosthetics==
{{Main|Neuroprosthetics}}

Neuroprosthetics is an area of [[neuroscience]] concerned with neural prostheses, that is, using artificial devices to replace the function of impaired nervous systems and brain related problems, or of sensory organs. The most widely used neuroprosthetic device is the [[cochlear implant]] which, as of December 2010, had been implanted in approximately 220,000 people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/pages/coch.aspx|title= Cochlear Implants|author= NIH Publication No. 11-4798|date= 1 March 2011|publisher= [[National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several neuroprosthetic devices that aim to restore vision, including [[retinal implant]]s.

The difference between BCIs and neuroprosthetics is mostly in how the terms are used: neuroprosthetics typically connect the nervous system to a device, whereas BCIs usually connect the brain (or nervous system) with a computer system. Practical neuroprosthetics can be linked to any part of the nervous system—for example, peripheral nerves—while the term "BCI" usually designates a narrower class of systems which interface with the central nervous system.

The terms are sometimes, however, used interchangeably. Neuroprosthetics and BCIs seek to achieve the same aims, such as restoring sight, hearing, movement, ability to communicate, and even [[cognitive function]].&lt;ref name="Krucoff 584"/&gt; Both use similar experimental methods and surgical techniques.

==Animal BCI research==

Several laboratories have managed to record signals from monkey and rat [[cerebral cortex|cerebral cortices]] to operate BCIs to produce movement. Monkeys have navigated [[Cursor (computers)|computer cursors]] on screen and commanded robotic arms to perform simple tasks simply by thinking about the task and seeing the visual feedback, but without any motor output.&lt;ref&gt;Miguel Nicolelis ''et al.'' (2001) [http://www.dukemedicine.org/AboutUs/Facts_and_Statistics/historical_highlights/index/view Duke neurobiologist has developed system that allows monkeys to control robot arms via brain signals] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219060005/http://www.dukemedicine.org/AboutUs/Facts_and_Statistics/historical_highlights/index/view |date=19 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008 photographs that showed a monkey at the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] operating a robotic arm by thinking were published in a number of well-known science journals and magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Baum| first = Michele| title = Monkey Uses Brain Power to Feed Itself With Robotic Arm| publisher = Pitt Chronicle| date = 6 September 2008| url = http://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/?p=1478| accessdate = 6 July 2009| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090910034547/http://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/?p=1478| archivedate = 10 September 2009| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early work===
[[File:Monkey using a robotic arm.jpg|thumb|Monkey operating a robotic arm with brain–computer interfacing (Schwartz lab, University of Pittsburgh)]]
In 1969 the [[operant conditioning]] studies of Fetz and colleagues,
at the Regional Primate Research Center and Department of Physiology and Biophysics, [[University of Washington School of Medicine]] in [[Seattle]], showed for the first time that monkeys could learn to control the deflection of a [[biofeedback]] meter arm with neural activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.163.3870.955|title=Operant Conditioning of Cortical Unit Activity|year=1969|last1=Fetz|first1=E.

Studies that developed [[algorithms]] to reconstruct movements from [[motor cortex]] [[neurons]], which control movement, date back to the 1970s. In the 1980s, Apostolos Georgopoulos at [[Johns Hopkins University]] found a mathematical relationship between the electrical responses of single motor cortex neurons in [[rhesus macaque|rhesus macaque monkeys]] and the direction in which they moved their arms (based on a [[cosine]] function). He also found that dispersed groups of neurons, in different areas of the monkey's brains, collectively controlled motor commands, but was able to record the firings of neurons in only one area at a time, because of the technical limitations imposed by his equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.2911737|title=Mental rotation of the neuronal population vector|year=1989|last1=Georgopoulos|first1=A.|last2=Lurito|first2=J.|last3=Petrides|first3=M|last4=Schwartz|first4=A.|last5=Massey|first5=J.|journal=Science|volume=243|pmid=2911737|issue=4888|bibcode = 1989Sci...243..234G|pages=234–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been rapid development in BCIs since the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=16859758 |url=http://www.cs.uu.nl/docs/vakken/mmpi/papers/Lebedev%202006.pdf |year=2006 |last1=Lebedev |first1=MA |last2=Nicolelis |first2=MA |title=Brain-machine interfaces: past, present and future |volume=29 |issue=9 |pages=536–46 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2006.07.004 |journal=Trends in Neurosciences }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several groups have been able to capture complex brain motor cortex signals by recording from [[neural ensemble]]s (groups of neurons) and using these to control external devices.

===Prominent research successes===

====Kennedy and Yang Dan====
Phillip Kennedy (who later founded [http://www.neuralsignals.com/ Neural Signals] in 1987) and colleagues built the first intracortical brain–computer interface by implanting neurotrophic-cone [[electrodes]] into monkeys.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

[[File:LGN Cat Vison Recording.jpg|thumb|Yang Dan and colleagues' recordings of cat vision using a BCI implanted in the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] (top row: original image; bottom row: recording)]] &lt;!-- FAIR USE of LGN Cat Vison Recording.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:LGN Cat Vison Recording.jpg for rationale --&gt; In 1999, researchers led by Yang Dan at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] decoded neuronal firings to reproduce images seen by cats. The team used an array of electrodes embedded in the [[thalamus]] (which integrates all of the brain’s sensory input) of sharp-eyed cats. Researchers targeted 177 brain cells in the thalamus [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] area, which decodes signals from the [[retina]]. The cats were shown eight short movies, and their neuron firings were recorded. Using mathematical filters, the researchers decoded the signals to generate movies of what the cats saw and were able to reconstruct recognizable scenes and moving objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.stanley.bme.gatech.edu/publications/stanley_dan_1999.pdf|pmid=10479703|year=1999|last1=Stanley|first1=GB|last2=Li|first2=FF|last3=Dan|first3=Y|title=Reconstruction of natural scenes from ensemble responses in the lateral geniculate nucleus|volume=19|issue=18|pages=8036–42|journal=Journal of Neuroscience}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar results in humans have since been achieved by researchers in [[Japan]] ([[#MEG and MRI|see below]]).

====Nicolelis====
[[Miguel Nicolelis]], a professor at [[Duke University]], in [[Durham, North Carolina]], has been a prominent proponent of using multiple electrodes spread over a greater area of the brain to obtain neuronal signals to drive a BCI.

After conducting initial studies in rats during the 1990s, Nicolelis and his colleagues developed BCIs that decoded brain activity in [[night monkey|owl monkeys]] and used the devices to reproduce monkey movements in robotic arms. Monkeys have advanced reaching and grasping abilities and good hand manipulation skills, making them ideal test subjects for this kind of work.

By 2000 the group succeeded in building a BCI that reproduced owl monkey movements while the monkey operated a [[joystick]] or reached for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/35042582|year=2000|last1=Nicolelis|first1=Miguel A.

But the monkeys could not see the arm moving and did not receive any feedback, a so-called [[open-loop controller|open-loop]] BCI.

[[File:Brain-computer interface (schematic).jpg|thumb|Diagram of the BCI developed by Miguel Nicolelis and colleagues for use on [[rhesus monkeys]]]]

Later experiments by Nicolelis using [[rhesus monkeys]] succeeded in [[feedback loop|closing the feedback loop]] and reproduced monkey reaching and grasping movements in a robot arm. With their deeply cleft and furrowed brains, rhesus monkeys are considered to be better models for human [[neurophysiology]] than owl monkeys. The monkeys were trained to reach and grasp objects on a computer screen by manipulating a joystick while corresponding movements by a robot arm were hidden.&lt;ref name=carmena2003&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=14624244|year=2003|last1=Carmena|first1=JM|last2=Lebedev|first2=MA|last3=Crist|first3=RE|last4=O'Doherty|first4=JE|last5=Santucci|first5=DM|last6=Dimitrov|first6=DF|last7=Patil|first7=PG|last8=Henriquez|first8=CS|last9=Nicolelis|first9=MA|title=Learning to control a brain-machine interface for reaching and grasping by primates|volume=1|issue=2|pages=E42|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0000042|pmc=261882|journal=PLoS Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lebedev2005&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4088-04.2005|title=Cortical Ensemble Adaptation to Represent Velocity of an Artificial Actuator Controlled by a Brain-Machine Interface|year=2005|last1=Lebedev|first1=M.

The BCI used velocity predictions to control reaching movements and simultaneously predicted [[Grip strength|handgripping force]]. In 2011 O'Doherty and colleagues showed a BCI with sensory feedback with [[rhesus monkeys]]. The monkey was brain controlling the position of an avatar arm while receiving sensory feedback through direct [[Cortical stimulation mapping|intracortical stimulation (ICMS)]] in the arm representation area of the [[sensory cortex]].&lt;ref name=Odoherty2003&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=21976021 | year=2011 | last1=O’Doherty | first1=JE | last2=Lebedev | first2=MA | last3=Ifft | first3=PJ | last4=Zhuang | first4=KZ | last5=Shokur | first5=S | last6=Bleuler | first6=H | last7=Nicolelis | first7=MA | title=Active tactile exploration using a brain–machine–brain interface | issue=7372 | pages=228–231 | doi=10.1038/nature10489 | pmc=3236080 | journal=Nature  | volume=479|bibcode = 2011Natur.479..228O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Donoghue, Schwartz and Andersen====
Other laboratories which have developed BCIs and algorithms that decode neuron signals include those run by John Donoghue at [[Brown University]], Andrew Schwartz at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and Richard Andersen at [[Caltech]]. These researchers have been able to produce working BCIs, even using recorded signals from far fewer neurons than did Nicolelis (15–30 neurons versus 50–200 neurons).

Donoghue's group reported training rhesus monkeys to use a BCI to track visual targets on a computer screen (closed-loop BCI) with or without assistance of a joystick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11894084|year=2002|last1=Serruya|first1=MD|last2=Hatsopoulos|first2=NG|last3=Paninski|first3=L|last4=Fellows|first4=MR|last5=Donoghue|first5=JP|title=Instant neural control of a movement signal|volume=416|issue=6877|pages=141–2|doi=10.1038/416141a|journal=Nature|bibcode = 2002Natur.416..141S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz's group created a BCI for three-dimensional tracking in virtual reality and also reproduced BCI control in a robotic arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1070291|title=Direct Cortical Control of 3D Neuroprosthetic Devices|year=2002|last1=Taylor|first1=D.

Andersen's group used recordings of [[premovement neuronal activity|premovement activity]] from the [[posterior parietal cortex]] in their BCI, including signals created when experimental animals anticipated receiving a reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1097938|title=Cognitive Control Signals for Neural Prosthetics|year=2004|last1=Musallam|first1=S.|journal=Science|volume=305|pmid=15247483|last2=Corneil|first2=BD|last3=Greger|first3=B|last4=Scherberger|first4=H|last5=Andersen|first5=RA|issue=5681|bibcode = 2004Sci...305..258M|pages=258–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other research====
In addition to predicting [[kinematic]] and [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] parameters of limb movements, BCIs that predict [[Electromyography|electromyographic]] or electrical activity of the muscles of primates are being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2005.04320.x|title=Frontal and parietal cortical ensembles predict single-trial muscle activity during reaching movements in primates|year=2005|last1=Santucci|first1=David M.|last2=Kralik|first2=Jerald D.|last3=Lebedev|first3=Mikhail A.|last4=Nicolelis|first4=Miguel A. L.|journal=European Journal of Neuroscience|volume=22|pmid=16190906|issue=6|pages=1529–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such BCIs could be used to restore mobility in paralyzed limbs by electrically stimulating muscles.

Miguel Nicolelis and colleagues demonstrated that the activity of large neural ensembles can predict arm position. This work made possible creation of BCIs that read arm movement intentions and translate them into movements of artificial actuators. Carmena and colleagues&lt;ref name=carmena2003/&gt; programmed the neural coding in a BCI that allowed a monkey to control reaching and grasping movements by a robotic arm. Lebedev and colleagues&lt;ref name=lebedev2005/&gt; argued that brain networks reorganize to create a new representation of the robotic appendage in addition to the representation of the animal's own limbs.

The biggest impediment to BCI technology at present is the lack of a sensor modality that provides safe, accurate and robust access to brain signals. It is conceivable or even likely, however, that such a sensor will be developed within the next twenty years. The use of such a sensor should greatly expand the range of communication functions that can be provided using a BCI.

Development and implementation of a BCI system is complex and time consuming. In response to this problem, Gerwin Schalk has been developing a general-purpose system for BCI research, called [[BCI2000]]. BCI2000 has been in development since 2000 in a project led by the Brain–Computer Interface R&amp;D Program at the [[Wadsworth Center]] of the [[New York State Department of Health]] in [[Albany, New York]], United States.

A new 'wireless' approach uses [[light-gated ion channel]]s such as [[Channelrhodopsin]] to control the activity of genetically defined subsets of neurons [[in vivo]]. In the context of a simple learning task, illumination of [[Transfection|transfected]] cells in the somatosensory cortex influenced the decision making process of freely moving [[mice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18094685|year=2008|last1=Huber|first1=D|last2=Petreanu|first2=L|last3=Ghitani|first3=N|last4=Ranade|first4=S|last5=Hromádka|first5=T|last6=Mainen|first6=Z|last7=Svoboda|first7=K|title=Sparse optical microstimulation in barrel cortex drives learned behaviour in freely moving mice|volume=451|issue=7174|pages=61–4|doi=10.1038/nature06445|journal=Nature|bibcode = 2008Natur.451...61H|pmc=3425380 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of BMIs has also led to a deeper understanding of neural networks and the central nervous system. Research has shown that despite the inclination of neuroscientists to believe that neurons have the most effect when working together, single neurons can be conditioned through the use of BMIs to fire at a pattern that allows primates to control motor outputs. The use of BMIs has led to development of the single neuron insufficiency principle which states that even with a well tuned firing rate single neurons can only carry a narrow amount of information and therefore the highest level of accuracy is achieved by recording firings of the collective ensemble. Other principles discovered with the use of BMIs include the neuronal multitasking principle, the neuronal mass principle, the neural degeneracy principle, and the plasticity principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nicolelis Miguel A. L |author2=Lebedev Mikhail A | year = 2009 | title = Principles of Neural Ensemble Physiology Underlying the Operation of Brain-Machine Interfaces | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 10 | issue = 7| pages = 530–540 | doi=10.1038/nrn2653 | pmid=19543222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BCIs are also proposed to be applied by users without disabilities. A [[User-centered design|user-centered]] categorization of BCI approaches by Thorsten O. Zander and Christian Kothe introduces the term passive BCI.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zander|first=Thorsten O|last2=Kothe|first2=Christian|title=Towards passive brain–computer interfaces: applying brain–computer interface technology to human–machine systems in general|journal=Journal of Neural Engineering|volume=8|issue=2|doi=10.1088/1741-2560/8/2/025005|pmid=21436512|page=025005|year=2011|bibcode=2011JNEng...8b5005Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next to active and reactive BCI that are used for directed control, passive BCIs allow for assessing and interpreting changes in the user state during Human-Computer Interaction ([[Human-Computer Interaction|HCI]]). In a secondary, implicit control loop the computer system adapts to its user improving its [[usability]] in general.

==Human BCI research==

===Invasive BCIs===
Invasive BCI requires surgery to implant electrodes under scalp for communicating brain signals. The main advantage is to provide more accurate reading; however, its downside includes side effects from the surgery. After the surgery, scar tissues may form which can make brain signals weaker. In addition, according to the research of Abdulkader at al., (2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abdulkader|first=Sarah N.|last2=Atia|first2=Ayman|last3=Mostafa|first3=Mostafa-Sami M.|date=2015-07|title=Brain computer interfacing: Applications and challenges|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eij.2015.06.002|journal=Egyptian Informatics Journal|volume=16|issue=2|pages=213–230|doi=10.1016/j.eij.2015.06.002|issn=1110-8665}}&lt;/ref&gt;, once implanted electrodes, the body may not accept the electrodes which may cause medical complications.

==== Vision ====
[[File:BCI JensNaumann.png|thumb|Jens Naumann, a man with acquired blindness, being interviewed about his vision BCI on CBS's [[The Early Show]]]]

Invasive BCI research has targeted repairing damaged sight and providing new functionality for people with paralysis. Invasive BCIs are implanted directly into the [[grey matter]] of the brain during neurosurgery. Because they lie in the grey matter, invasive devices produce the highest quality signals of BCI devices but are prone to [[scar|scar-tissue]] build-up, causing the signal to become weaker, or even non-existent, as the body reacts to a foreign object in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Polikov, Vadim S., Patrick A. Tresco, and William M. Reichert |title=Response of brain tissue to chronically implanted neural electrodes |journal=Journal of Neuroscience Methods |volume=148 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=1–18 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027005002931 |doi=10.1016/j.jneumeth.2005.08.015|pmid=16198003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[vision science]]'', direct [[brain implant]]s have been used to treat non-[[congenital]] (acquired) blindness. One of the first scientists to produce a working brain interface to restore sight was private researcher [[William H. Dobelle|William Dobelle]].

Dobelle's first prototype was implanted into "Jerry", a man blinded in adulthood, in 1978. A single-array BCI containing 68 electrodes was implanted onto Jerry’s [[visual cortex]] and succeeded in producing [[phosphenes]], the sensation of seeing light. The system included cameras mounted on glasses to send signals to the implant. Initially, the implant allowed Jerry to see shades of grey in a limited field of vision at a low frame-rate. This also required him to be hooked up to a [[mainframe computer]], but shrinking electronics and faster computers made his artificial eye more portable and now enable him to perform simple tasks unassisted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.09/vision.html Vision quest], ''Wired Magazine'', September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BrainGate.jpg|thumb|Dummy unit illustrating the design of a [[BrainGate]] interface]]

In 2002, Jens Naumann, also blinded in adulthood, became the first in a series of 16 paying patients to receive Dobelle’s second generation implant, marking one of the earliest commercial uses of BCIs. The second generation device used a more sophisticated implant enabling better mapping of phosphenes into coherent vision. Phosphenes are spread out across the visual field in what researchers call "the starry-night effect". Immediately after his implant, Jens was able to use his imperfectly restored vision to [[driving|drive]] an automobile slowly around the parking area of the research institute.&lt;ref name="Naumann, J. 2012"&gt;Naumann, J.

Subsequently, when Mr. Naumann and the other patients in the program began having problems with their vision, there was no relief and they eventually lost their "sight" again.

====Movement====
BCIs focusing on ''motor neuroprosthetics'' aim to either restore movement in individuals with paralysis or provide devices to assist them, such as interfaces with computers or robot arms.

Researchers at [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta]], led by Philip Kennedy and Roy Bakay, were first to install a brain implant in a human that produced signals of high enough quality to simulate movement. Their patient, Johnny Ray (1944–2002), suffered from ‘[[locked-in syndrome]]’ after suffering a brain-stem [[stroke]] in 1997. Ray’s implant was installed in 1998 and he lived long enough to start working with the implant, eventually learning to control a computer cursor; he died in 2002 of a [[brain aneurysm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1097/00001756-199806010-00007|pmid=9665587|year=1998|last1=Kennedy|first1=PR|last2=Bakay|first2=RA|title=Restoration of neural output from a paralyzed patient by a direct brain connection|volume=9|issue=8|pages=1707–11|journal=NeuroReport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tetraplegic]] [[Matt Nagle]] became the first person to control an artificial hand using a BCI in 2005 as part of the first nine-month human trial of [[Cyberkinetics]]’s [[BrainGate]] chip-implant.

===Partially invasive BCIs===
Partially invasive BCI devices are implanted inside the skull but rest outside the brain rather than within the grey matter. They produce better resolution signals than non-invasive BCIs where the bone tissue of the cranium deflects and deforms signals and have a lower risk of forming scar-tissue in the brain than fully invasive BCIs. There has been preclinical demonstration of intracortical BCIs from the stroke perilesional cortex.&lt;ref name="robust neuroprosthetic"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/35/22/8653.abstract |title=Robust Neuroprosthetic Control from the Stroke Perilesional Cortex |year=2015 |last1=Gulati |first1=Tanuj |last2=Won |first2=Seok Joon |last3=Ramanathan |first3=Dhakshin S. |last4=Wong |first4=Chelsea C. |last5=Bodepudi |first5=Anitha |last6=Swanson |first6=Raymond A. |last7=Ganguly |first7=Karunesh |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |volume=35 |pages=8653–8661 |pmid=26041930 |issue=22 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5007-14.2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Electrocorticography]]'' (ECoG) measures the electrical activity of the brain taken from beneath the skull in a similar way to non-invasive electroencephalography, but the electrodes are embedded in a thin plastic pad that is placed above the cortex, beneath the [[dura mater]].&lt;ref&gt;Serruya MD, Donoghue JP. (2003) Chapter III: Design Principles of a Neuromotor Prosthetic Device in Neuroprosthetics: Theory and Practice, ed. Kenneth W. Horch, Gurpreet S. Dhillon. Imperial College Press.&lt;/ref&gt; ECoG technologies were first trialled in humans in 2004 by Eric Leuthardt and Daniel Moran from [[Washington University]] in [[St Louis]]. In a later trial, the researchers enabled a teenage boy to play [[Space Invaders]] using his ECoG implant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news-info.wustl.edu/news/page/normal/7800.html Teenager moves video icons just by imagination], press release, Washington University in St Louis, 9 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This research indicates that control is rapid, requires minimal training, and may be an ideal tradeoff with regards to signal fidelity and level of invasiveness.

(Note: these electrodes had not been implanted in the patient with the intention of developing a BCI. The patient had been suffering from severe [[epilepsy]] and the electrodes were temporarily implanted to help his physicians localize seizure foci; the BCI researchers simply took advantage of this.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schalk|first1=G|last2=Miller|first2=KJ|last3=Anderson|first3=NR|last4=Wilson|first4=JA|last5=Smyth|first5=MD|last6=Ojemann|first6=JG|last7=Moran|first7=DW|last8=Wolpaw|first8=JR|last9=Leuthardt|first9=EC|title=Two-dimensional movement control using electrocorticographic signals in humans|journal=Journal of Neural Engineering|date=2008|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1741-2552/5/1/008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Signals can be either subdural or epidural, but are not taken from within the brain [[parenchyma]] itself. It has not been studied extensively until recently due to the limited access of subjects. Currently, the only manner to acquire the signal for study is through the use of patients requiring invasive monitoring for localization and resection of an epileptogenic focus.

ECoG is a very promising intermediate BCI modality because it has higher spatial resolution, better signal-to-noise ratio, wider frequency range, and less training requirements than scalp-recorded EEG, and at the same time has lower technical difficulty, lower clinical risk, and probably superior long-term stability than intracortical single-neuron recording. This feature profile and recent evidence of the high level of control with minimal training requirements shows potential for real world application for people with motor disabilities.&lt;ref name=Mondeofuse&gt;{{cite news |first= Takafumi|last= Yanagisawa|title=Electrocorticographic Control of Prosthetic Arm in Paralyzed Patients |doi=10.1002/ana.22613 |quote= ECoG- Based BCI has advantage in signal and durability that are absolutely necessary for clinical application|work=[[American Neurological Association]] |year= 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TelepathicCommVowel&gt;{{cite news |first= X.|last= Pei|title=Decoding Vowels and Consonants in Spoken and Imagined Words Using Electrocorticographic Signals in Humans |pmid=21750369 |quote= Justin Williams, a biomedical engineer at the university, has already transformed the ECoG implant into a micro device that can be installed with a minimum of fuss.

Light reactive imaging BCI devices are still in the realm of theory. These would involve implanting a [[laser]] inside the skull. The laser would be trained on a single neuron and the neuron's reflectance measured by a separate sensor. When the neuron fires, the laser light pattern and wavelengths it reflects would change slightly. This would allow researchers to monitor single neurons but require less contact with tissue and reduce the risk of scar-tissue build-up.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Non-invasive BCIs===
There have also been experiments in humans using [[non-invasive (medical)|non-invasive]] [[neuroimaging]] technologies as interfaces. The substantial majority of published BCI work involves noninvasive EEG-based BCIs. Noninvasive EEG-based technologies and interfaces have been used for a much broader variety of applications. Although EEG-based interfaces are easy to wear and do not require surgery, they have relatively poor spatial resolution and cannot effectively use higher-frequency signals because the skull dampens signals, dispersing and blurring the electromagnetic waves created by the neurons. EEG-based interfaces also require some time and effort prior to each usage session, whereas non-EEG-based ones, as well as invasive ones require no prior-usage training. Overall, the best BCI for each user depends on numerous factors.

==== Non-EEG-based human–computer interface ====

=====Pupil-size oscillation=====
In a 2016 article, an entirely new communication device and non-EEG-based human-computer interface was developed, requiring no [[Fixation (visual)|visual fixation]] or ability to move eyes at all, that is based on covert [[interest (emotion)|interest]] in (i.e. without fixing eyes on) chosen letter on a virtual keyboard with letters each having its own (background) circle that is micro-oscillating in brightness in different time transitions, where the letter selection is based on best fit between, on one hand, unintentional pupil-size oscillation pattern, and, on the other hand, the circle-in-background's brightness oscillation pattern. Accuracy is additionally improved by user's mental rehearsing the words 'bright' and 'dark' in synchrony with the brightness transitions of the circle/letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0148805|pmid=26848745|title=The Mind-Writing Pupil: A Human-Computer Interface Based on Decoding of Covert Attention through Pupillometry|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=11|issue=2|pages=e0148805|year=2016|last1=Mathôt|first1=Sebastiaan|last2=Melmi|first2=Jean-Baptiste|last3=Van Der Linden|first3=Lotje|last4=Van Der Stigchel|first4=Stefan|pmc=4743834|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1148805M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Functional near-infrared spectroscopy=====

====Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces====

=====Overview=====
[[File:ElectroEncephalogram.png|thumb|Recordings of brainwaves produced by an [[electroencephalogram]]]]

[[Electroencephalography]] (EEG) is the most studied non-invasive interface, mainly due to its fine [[temporal resolution]], ease of use, portability and low set-up cost. The technology is somewhat susceptible to [[noise]] however.

In the early days of BCI research, another substantial barrier to using EEG as a brain–computer interface was the extensive training required before users can work the technology. For example, in experiments beginning in the mid-1990s, Niels Birbaumer at the [[University of Tübingen]] in [[Germany]] trained severely paralysed people to self-regulate the ''slow cortical potentials'' in their EEG to such an extent that these signals could be used as a binary signal to control a computer cursor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200307/communicating-brain-waves Just short of telepathy: can you interact with the outside world if you can't even blink an eye?], ''Psychology Today'', May–June 2003&lt;/ref&gt; (Birbaumer had earlier trained [[epilepsy|epileptics]] to prevent impending fits by controlling this low voltage wave.) The experiment saw ten patients trained to move a computer cursor by controlling their brainwaves. The process was slow, requiring more than an hour for patients to write 100 characters with the cursor, while training often took many months. However, the slow cortical potential approach to BCIs has not been used in several years, since other approaches require little or no training, are faster and more accurate, and work for a greater proportion of users.

Another research parameter is the type of [[neural oscillation|oscillatory activity]] that is measured. Birbaumer's later research with Jonathan Wolpaw at [[New York State University]] has focused on developing technology that would allow users to choose the brain signals they found easiest to operate a BCI, including ''[[Mu wave|mu]]'' and ''[[Beta wave|beta]]'' rhythms.

A further parameter is the method of feedback used and this is shown in studies of [[P300 (Neuroscience)|P300]] signals. Patterns of P300 waves are generated involuntarily ([[Event-related potential|stimulus-feedback]]) when people see something they recognize and may allow BCIs to decode categories of thoughts without training patients first. By contrast, the [[biofeedback]] methods described above require learning to control brainwaves so the resulting brain activity can be detected.

While an EEG based brain-computer interface has been pursued extensively by a number of research labs, recent advancements made by [[Bin He]] and his team at the [[University of Minnesota]] suggest the potential of an EEG based brain-computer interface to accomplish tasks close to invasive brain-computer interface. Using advanced functional neuroimaging including BOLD functional [[MRI]] and [[EEG]] source imaging, Bin He and co-workers identified the co-variation and co-localization of electrophysiological and hemodynamic signals induced by motor imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19850134|year=2010|last1=Yuan|first1=H|title=Negative covariation between task-related responses in alpha/beta-band activity and BOLD in human sensorimotor cortex: an EEG and fMRI study of motor imagery and movements|volume=49|issue=3|pages=2596–2606|journal=NeuroImage|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.028|last2=Liu|first2=Tao|last3=Szarkowski|first3=Rebecca|last4=Rios|first4=Cristina|last5=Ashe|first5=James|last6=He|first6=Bin|pmc=2818527}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Refined by a neuroimaging approach and by a training protocol, Bin He and co-workers demonstrated the ability of a non-invasive EEG based brain-computer interface to control the flight of a virtual helicopter in 3-dimensional space, based upon motor imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=22046274|year=2011|last1=Doud|first1=AJ|title=Continuous Three-Dimensional Control of a Virtual Helicopter Using a Motor Imagery Based Brain-Computer Interface|volume=6|issue=10|pages=e26322|journal=PLoS ONE|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0026322|editor1-last=Gribble|editor1-first=Paul L|last2=Lucas|first2=John P.|last3=Pisansky|first3=Marc T.|last4=He|first4=Bin|pmc=3202533|bibcode = 2011PLoSO...626322D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013 it was announced that Bin He had developed the technique to enable a remote-control helicopter to be guided through an obstacle course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22764978 |title=Thought-guided helicopter takes off |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=5 June 2013 |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In addition to a brain-computer interface based on brain waves, as recorded from scalp EEG electrodes, Bin He and co-workers explored a virtual EEG signal-based brain-computer interface by first solving the EEG [[inverse problem]] and then used the resulting virtual EEG for brain-computer interface tasks. Well-controlled studies suggested the merits of such a source analysis based brain-computer interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15876632|year=2004|last1=Qin|first1=L|title=Motor imagery classification by means of source analysis for brain-computer interface applications|volume=1|issue=3|pages=135–141|journal=Journal of Neural Engineering|doi=10.1088/1741-2560/1/3/002|last2=Ding|first2=Lei|last3=He|first3=Bin|bibcode = 2004JNEng...1..135Q |pmc=1945182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study found that severely motor-impaired patients could communicate faster and more reliably with non-invasive EEG BCI, than with any muscle-based communication channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Höhne|first1=J|last2=Holz|first2=E|last3=Staiger-Sälzer|first3=P|last4=Müller|first4=KR|last5=Kübler|first5=A|last6=Tangermann|first6=M|title=Motor imagery for severely motor-impaired patients: evidence for brain-computer interfacing as superior control solution|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2014|volume=9|issue=8|pages=e104854|pmid=25162231|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0104854|bibcode = 2014PLoSO...9j4854H|pmc=4146550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dry active electrode arrays====
In the early 1990s Babak Taheri, at [[University of California, Davis]] demonstrated the first single and also multichannel dry active electrode arrays using micro-machining. The single channel dry EEG electrode construction and results were published in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0013-4694(94)90053-1|title=A dry electrode for EEG recording☆|year=1994|last1=Taheri|first1=B|last2=Knight|first2=R|last3=Smith|first3=R|journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology|volume=90|pmid=7514984|issue=5|pages=376–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrayed electrode was also demonstrated to perform well compared to [[silver]]/[[silver chloride]] electrodes. The device consisted of four sites of sensors with integrated electronics to reduce noise by [[impedance matching]]. The advantages of such electrodes are: (1) no electrolyte used, (2) no skin preparation, (3) significantly reduced sensor size, and (4) compatibility with EEG monitoring systems. The active electrode array is an integrated system made of an array of capacitive sensors with local integrated circuitry housed in a package with batteries to power the circuitry. This level of integration was required to achieve the functional performance obtained by the electrode.

The electrode was tested on an electrical test bench and on human subjects in four modalities of EEG activity, namely: (1) spontaneous EEG, (2) sensory event-related potentials, (3) brain stem potentials, and (4) cognitive event-related potentials. The performance of the dry electrode compared favorably with that of the standard wet electrodes in terms of skin preparation, no gel requirements (dry), and higher signal-to-noise ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1994PhDT........82A |title=Active Micromachined Scalp Electrode Array for Eeg Signal Recording |author=Alizadeh-Taheri, Babak |journal=PhD Thesis |year=1994|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 researchers at [[Case Western Reserve University]], in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], led by Hunter Peckham, used 64-electrode EEG skullcap to return limited hand movements to [[quadriplegic]] Jim Jatich. As Jatich concentrated on simple but opposite concepts like up and down, his beta-rhythm EEG output was analysed using software to identify patterns in the noise. A basic pattern was identified and used to control a switch: Above average activity was set to on, below average off. As well as enabling Jatich to control a computer cursor the signals were also used to drive the nerve controllers embedded in his hands, restoring some movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.08/assist_pr.html The Next Brainiacs]''Wired Magazine'', August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== SSVEP mobile EEG BCIs ====
In 2009, the NCTU Brain-Computer-Interface-headband was reported. The researchers who developed this BCI-headband also engineered silicon-based [[Microelectromechanical systems|MicroElectro-Mechanical System]] (MEMS) [[Electroencephalography#Dry EEG electrodes|dry electrodes]]  designed for application in non-hairy sites of the body. These electrodes were secured to the [[Data acquisition|DAQ]] board in the headband with snap-on electrode holders. The signal processing module measured [[Alpha wave|alpha]] activity and the Bluetooth enabled phone assessed the patients’ alertness and capacity for cognitive performance. When the subject became drowsy, the phone sent arousing feedback to the operator to rouse them. This research was supported by the National Science Council, Taiwan, R.O.C., NSC, National Chiao-Tung University, Taiwan’s Ministry of Education, and the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lin|first=Chin-Teng|title=Wearable and Wireless Brain-Computer Interface and Its Applications|date=2009|work=Foundations of Augmented Cognition.

In 2013, comparative tests were performed on android cell phone, tablet, and computer based BCIs, analyzing the power [[Spectral density|spectrum density]] of resultant EEG SSVEPs. The stated goals of this study, which involved scientists supported in part by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, were to “increase the practicability, portability, and ubiquity of an SSVEP-based BCI, for daily use.” Citation It was reported that the stimulation frequency on all mediums was accurate, although the cell phone’s signal demonstrated some instability. The amplitudes of the SSVEPs for the laptop and tablet were also reported to be larger than those of the cell phone. These two qualitative characterizations were suggested as indicators of the feasibility of using a mobile stimulus BCI.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===== Limitations =====
In 2011, researchers stated that continued work should address ease of use, performance robustness, reducing hardware and software costs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One of the difficulties with EEG readings is the large susceptibility to motion artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Symeonidou|first=Evangelia-Regkina|last2=D Nordin|first2=Andrew|last3=Hairston|first3=W David|last4=Ferris|first4=Daniel|date=2018-04-03|title=Effects of Cable Sway, Electrode Surface Area, and Electrode Mass on Electroencephalography Signal Quality during Motion|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324211295|journal=Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)|volume=18|issue=4|pages=1073|doi=10.3390/s18041073|pmid=29614020|pmc=5948545}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most the previously described research projects, the participants were asked to sit still, reducing head and eye movements as much as possible, and measurements were taken in a laboratory setting. However, since the emphasized application of these initiatives had been in creating a mobile device for daily use,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the technology had to be tested in motion.

In 2013, researchers tested mobile EEG-based BCI technology, measuring SSVEPs from participants as they walked on a treadmill at varying speeds. This research was supported by the [[Office of Naval Research]], Army Research Office, and the U.S. Army Research Laboratory. Stated results were that as speed increased the SSVEP detectability using CCA decreased. As independent component analysis ([[Independent component analysis|ICA]]) had been shown to be efficient in separating EEG signals from noise,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Yijun|last2=Wang|first2=Ruiping|last3=Gao|first3=Xiaorong|last4=Hong|first4=Bo|last5=Gao|first5=Shangkai|date=2006-6|title=A practical VEP-based brain-computer interface|journal=IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering|volume=14|issue=2|pages=234–239|doi=10.1109/TNSRE.2006.875576|issn=1534-4320|pmid=16792302}}&lt;/ref&gt; the scientists applied ICA to CCA extracted EEG data. They stated that the CCA data with and without ICA processing were similar. Thus, they concluded that CCA independently demonstrated a robustness to motion artifacts that indicates it may be a beneficial algorithm to apply to BCIs used in real world conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Prosthesis and environment control====
Non-invasive BCIs have also been applied to enable brain-control of prosthetic upper and lower extremity devices in people with paralysis. For example, Gert Pfurtscheller of [[Graz University of Technology]] and colleagues demonstrated a BCI-controlled [[functional electrical stimulation]] system to restore upper extremity movements in a person with tetraplegia due to [[spinal cord injury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pfurtscheller | first1 = G. | last2 = Müller | first2 = G.

In their [[spinal cord injury research]] study, a person with paraplegia was able to operate a BCI-robotic gait orthosis to regain basic brain-controlled ambulation.&lt;ref name="DoWang2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Do|first1=An H|last2=Wang|first2=Po T|last3=King|first3=Christine E|last4=Chun|first4=Sophia N|last5=Nenadic|first5=Zoran|title=Brain-computer interface controlled robotic gait orthosis|journal=Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation|volume=10|issue=1|year=2013|page=111|issn=1743-0003|doi=10.1186/1743-0003-10-111|pmid=24321081|pmc=3907014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXNCwonhjG8 Subject with Paraplegia Operates BCI-controlled RoGO (4x)] at YouTube.com&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2009 Alex Blainey, an independent researcher based in the UK, successfully used the [[Emotiv]] EPOC to control a 5 axis robot arm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Cq35VbRpTY Alex Blainey controls a cheap consumer robot arm using the EPOC headset via a serial relay port] at YouTube.com&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on to make several demonstration mind controlled wheelchairs and home automation that could be operated by people with limited or no motor control such as those with paraplegia and cerebral palsy.

Research into military use of BCIs funded by [[DARPA]] has been ongoing since the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Vidal1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vidal2" /&gt; The current focus of research is user-to-user communication through analysis of neural signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Drummond| first = Katie| title = Pentagon Preps Soldier Telepathy Push| publisher = Wired Magazine|date = 14 May 2009| url =https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2009/05/pentagon-preps-soldier-telepathy-push| accessdate = 6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====DIY and open source BCI====
In 2001, The OpenEEG Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openeeg.sourceforge.net/doc/ |title=The OpenEEG Project |publisher=Openeeg.sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was initiated by a group of DIY neuroscientists and engineers. The ModularEEG was the primary device created by the OpenEEG community; it was a 6-channel signal capture board that cost between $200 and $400 to make at home. The OpenEEG Project marked a significant moment in the emergence of DIY brain-computer interfacing.

In 2010, the Frontier Nerds of NYU's ITP program published a thorough tutorial titled How To Hack Toy EEGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontiernerds.com/brain-hack |title=How To Hack Toy EEGs |publisher=Frontiernerds.com |date= |accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tutorial, which stirred the minds of many budding DIY BCI enthusiasts, demonstrated how to create a single channel at-home EEG with an [[Arduino]] and a Mattel [[Mindflex]] at a very reasonable price. This tutorial amplified the DIY BCI movement.

In 2013, OpenBCI emerged from a [[DARPA]] solicitation and subsequent [[Kickstarter]] campaign. They created a high-quality, open-source 8-channel EEG acquisition board, known as the 32bit Board, that retailed for under $500. Two years later they created the first 3D-printed EEG Headset, known as the Ultracortex, as well as a 4-channel EEG acquisition board, known as the Ganglion Board, that retailed for under $100.

In 2015, NeuroTechX was created with the mission of building an international network for neurotechnology.

====MEG and MRI====

[[File:Visual stimulus reconstruction using fMRI.png|thumb|ATR Labs' reconstruction of human vision using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] (top row: original image; bottom row: reconstruction from mean of combined readings)]]

[[Magnetoencephalography]] (MEG) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) have both been used successfully as non-invasive BCIs.&lt;ref&gt;Ranganatha Sitaram, Andrea Caria, Ralf Veit, Tilman Gaber, Giuseppina Rota, Andrea Kuebler and Niels Birbaumer(2007) "[http://mts.hindawi.com/utils/GetFile.aspx?msid=25487&amp;vnum=2&amp;ftype=manuscript FMRI Brain–Computer Interface: A Tool for Neuroscientific Research and Treatment]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}"&lt;/ref&gt; In a widely reported experiment, fMRI allowed two users being scanned to play [[Pong]] in real-time by altering their [[haemodynamic response]] or brain blood flow through [[biofeedback]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/news040823-18|title=Mental ping-pong could aid paraplegics|journal=News@nature|year=2004|last1=Peplow|first1=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

fMRI measurements of haemodynamic responses in real time have also been used to control robot arms with a seven-second delay between thought and movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20060525/117493/ To operate robot only with brain], ATR and Honda develop BMI base technology, ''Tech-on'', 26 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 research developed in the Advanced Telecommunications Research (ATR) [[Computational Neuroscience]] Laboratories in [[Kyoto]], Japan, allowed the scientists to reconstruct images directly from the brain and display them on a computer in black and white at a [[Display resolution|resolution]] of 10x10 [[pixels]]. The article announcing these achievements was the [[Article (publishing)|cover story]] of the journal [[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]] of 10 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2008.11.004|pmid=19081384|title=Visual Image Reconstruction from Human Brain Activity using a Combination of Multiscale Local Image Decoders|journal=Neuron|volume=60|issue=5|pages=915–29|year=2008|last1=Miyawaki|first1=Yoichi|last2=Uchida|first2=Hajime|last3=Yamashita|first3=Okito|last4=Sato|first4=Masa-aki|last5=Morito|first5=Yusuke|last6=Tanabe|first6=Hiroki C.|last7=Sadato|first7=Norihiro|last8=Kamitani|first8=Yukiyasu}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 researchers from [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] published&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.031|pmid=21945275|title=Reconstructing Visual Experiences from Brain Activity Evoked by Natural Movies|journal=Current Biology|volume=21|issue=19|pages=1641–1646|year=2011|last1=Nishimoto|first1=Shinji|last2=Vu|first2=An T.|last3=Naselaris|first3=Thomas|last4=Benjamini|first4=Yuval|last5=Yu|first5=Bin|last6=Gallant|first6=Jack L.|pmc=3326357}}&lt;/ref&gt; a study reporting second-by-second reconstruction of videos watched by the study's subjects, from fMRI data. This was achieved by creating a statistical model relating visual patterns in videos shown to the subjects, to the brain activity caused by watching the videos. This model was then used to look up the 100 one-second video segments, in a database of 18 million seconds of random [[YouTube]] videos, whose visual patterns most closely matched the brain activity recorded when subjects watched a new video. These 100 one-second video extracts were then combined into a mashed-up image that resembled the video being watched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2011/09/22/breakthrough-could-enable-others-to-watch-your-dreams-and-memories-video/  | title= Breakthrough Could Enable Others to Watch Your Dreams and Memories  | last = Yam  | first = Philip  | date       = 22 September 2011  | publisher  = Scientific American  | accessdate = 25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = https://sites.google.com/site/gallantlabucb/publications/nishimoto-et-al-2011  | title      = Reconstructing visual experiences from brain activity evoked by natural movies (Project page)  | publisher  = The Gallant Lab at [[UC Berkeley]]  | accessdate = 25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url= http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2011/09/22/brain-movies/| title= Scientists use brain imaging to reveal the movies in our mind  | author= Yasmin Anwar  | date= 22 September 2011  | publisher  = [[UC Berkeley]] News Center| accessdate = 25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====BCI control strategies in neurogaming====

=====Motor imagery=====

[[Motor imagery]] involves the imagination of the movement of various body parts resulting in [[sensorimotor cortex]] activation, which modulates sensorimotor oscillations in the EEG. This can be detected by the BCI to infer a user's intent. Motor imagery typically requires a number of sessions of training before acceptable control of the BCI is acquired. These training sessions may take a number of hours over several days before users can consistently employ the technique with acceptable levels of precision. Regardless of the duration of the training session, users are unable to master the control scheme. This results in very slow pace of the gameplay.&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coyle|first1=Damien|last2=Marshall|first2=David|last3=Wilson|first3=Shane|last4=Callaghan|first4=Michael|title=Games, Gameplay, and BCI: The State of the Art|journal=IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games|volume=5|issue=2|page = 83|doi=10.1109/TCIAIG.2013.2263555 |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advance machine learning methods were recently developed to compute a subject-specific model for detecting the performance of motor imagery. The top performing algorithm from BCI Competition IV&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; dataset 2 for motor imagery is the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern, developed by Ang et al. from [[A*STAR]], [[Singapore]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ang|first=Kai Keng|last2=Chin|first2=Zheng Yang|last3=Wang|first3=Chuanchu|last4=Guan|first4=Cuntai|last5=Zhang|first5=Haihong|date=1 January 2012|title=Filter bank common spatial pattern algorithm on BCI competition IV Datasets 2a and 2b|journal=Neuroprosthetics|volume=6|page=39|doi=10.3389/fnins.2012.00039|pmc=3314883|pmid=22479236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Bio/neurofeedback for passive BCI designs=====
Biofeedback is used to monitor a subject's mental relaxation. In some cases, biofeedback does not monitor electroencephalography (EEG), but instead bodily parameters such as [[electromyography]] (EMG), [[galvanic skin response|galvanic skin resistance]] (GSR), and [[heart rate variability]] (HRV). Many biofeedback systems are used to treat certain disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sleep problems in children, teeth grinding, and chronic pain. EEG biofeedback systems typically monitor four different bands (theta: 4–7&amp;nbsp;Hz, alpha:8–12&amp;nbsp;Hz, SMR: 12–15&amp;nbsp;Hz, beta: 15–18&amp;nbsp;Hz) and challenge the subject to control them. Passive BCI&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; involves using BCI to enrich human–machine interaction with implicit information on the actual user's state, for example, simulations to detect when users intend to push brakes during an emergency car stopping procedure. Game developers using passive BCIs need to acknowledge that through repetition of game levels the user's cognitive state will change or adapt. Within the first play
of a level, the user will react to things differently from during the second play: for example, the user will be less surprised at an event in the game if he/she is expecting it.&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee.org"/&gt;

=====Visual evoked potential (VEP)=====

A VEP is an electrical potential recorded after a subject is presented with a type of visual stimuli. There are several types of VEPs.

[[Steady state visually evoked potential|Steady-state visually evoked potential]]s (SSVEPs) use potentials generated by exciting the [[retina]], using visual stimuli modulated at certain frequencies. SSVEP's stimuli are often formed from alternating checkerboard patterns and at times simply use flashing images. The frequency of the phase reversal of the stimulus used can be clearly distinguished in the spectrum of an EEG; this makes detection of SSVEP stimuli relatively easy. SSVEP has proved to be successful within many BCI systems. This is due to several factors, the signal elicited is measurable in as large a population as the transient VEP and blink movement and electrocardiographic artefacts do not affect the frequencies monitored. In addition, the SSVEP signal is exceptionally robust; the topographic organization of the primary visual cortex is such that a broader area obtains afferents from the central or fovial region of the visual field. SSVEP does have several problems however. As SSVEPs use flashing stimuli to infer a user's intent, the user must gaze at one of the flashing or iterating symbols in order to interact with the system. It is, therefore, likely that the symbols could become irritating and uncomfortable to use during longer play sessions, which can often last more than an hour which may not be an ideal gameplay.

Another type of VEP used with applications is the [[P300 (neuroscience)|P300 potential]]. The P300 event-related potential is a positive peak in the EEG that occurs at roughly 300 ms after the appearance of a target stimulus (a stimulus for which the user is waiting or seeking) or [[Oddball paradigm|oddball stimuli]]. The P300 amplitude decreases as the target stimuli and the ignored stimuli grow more similar.The P300 is thought to be related to a higher level attention process or an orienting response Using P300 as a control scheme has the advantage of the participant only having to attend limited training sessions. The first application to use the P300 model was the P300 matrix. Within this system, a subject would choose a letter from a grid of 6 by 6 letters and numbers. The rows and columns of the grid flashed sequentially and every time the selected "choice letter" was illuminated the user's P300 was (potentially) elicited. However, the communication process, at approximately 17 characters per minute, was quite slow. The P300 is a BCI that offers a discrete selection rather than a continuous control mechanism. The advantage of P300 use within games is that the player does not have to teach himself/herself how to use a completely new control system and so only has to undertake short training instances, to learn the gameplay mechanics and basic use of the BCI paradigm.&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.intechopen.com/articles/show/title/application-of-p300-event-related-potential-in-brain-computer-interface|last=Haider|first=Ali|last2=Fazel-Rezai|first2=Reza|date=2017|publisher=InTech|language=en|doi=10.5772/intechopen.69309|title=Event-Related Potentials and Evoked Potentials|isbn=978-953-51-3639-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the DARPA's budget for the fiscal year included $4 million to start up a program called Silent Talk. The goal was to "''allow user-to-user communication on the battlefield without the use of vocalized speech through analysis of neural signals''". ''The program had three major goals: 1) to attempt to identify electroencephalography patterns unique to individual words, 2) ensure that those patterns are generalizable across users in order to prevent extensive device training, and 3) construct a fieldable pre-prototype that would decode the signal and transmit over a limited range.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/attachments/%282G7%29%20Global%20Nav%20-%20About%20Us%20-%20Budget%20-%20Budget%20Entries%20-%20FY2010%20%28Approved%29.pdf|title=Fiscal Year 2010 Budget Estimates.

In a $6.3 million Army initiative to invent devices for telepathic communication, [[Gerwin Schalk]], underwritten in a $2.2 million grant, found the use of ECoG signals can discriminate the vowels and consonants embedded in spoken and imagined words, shedding light on the distinct mechanisms associated with production of vowels and consonants, and could provide the basis for brain-based communication using imagined speech.&lt;ref name="TelepathicCommVowel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TelepathicComm"&gt;{{cite news |first= Pagan|last= Kennedy|title=The Cyborg in Us All |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/magazine/the-cyborg-in-us-all.html?pagewanted=all |quote=|work=[[New York Times]] |date=18 September 2011  |accessdate=28 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 [[Kevin Warwick]] had an array of 100 electrodes fired into his nervous system in order to link his nervous system into the Internet to investigate enhancement possibilities.

Research into synthetic telepathy using [[subvocalization]] is taking place at the University of California, Irvine under lead scientist Mike D'Zmura. The first such communication took place in the 1960s using EEG to create Morse code using brain alpha waves. Using EEG to communicate imagined speech is less accurate than the invasive method of placing an electrode between the skull and the brain.&lt;ref name= Telepathy&gt;{{cite news|title= Army Developing‘synthetic telepathy’|url= http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27162401/#.Uidehm25fIV|accessdate=13 October 2008 |newspaper=Discovery News|date=13 October 2008|author= Bland, Eric }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 2013 the group with [[Miguel Nicolelis]] at [[Duke University]] and IINN-ELS successfully connected the brains of two rats with electronic interfaces that allowed them to directly share information, in [[Miguel Nicolelis#Brain to brain|the first-ever direct brain-to-brain interface]].&lt;ref name=" srep01319"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pais-Vieira |first=Miguel |last2=Lebedev |first2=Mikhail |last3=Kunicki |first3=Carolina |last4=Wang |first4=Jing |last5=Nicolelis |first5=Miguel A.L. |title=A Brain-to-Brain Interface for Real-Time Sharing of Sensorimotor Information|journal=[[Scientific Reports]] |volume=3 |pages=1319 |date=28 February 2013 |doi=10.1038/srep01319|bibcode = 2013NatSR...3E1319P |pmid=23448946 |pmc=3584574}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=One Rat Thinks, and Another Reacts|author=Gorman, James |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/science/new-research-suggests-two-rat-brains-can-be-linked.html|work=New York Times|date=28 February 2013|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/feb/28/brains-rats-connected-share-information|title=Brain-to-brain interface lets rats share information via internet|website=The Guardian|date=1 March 2013|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cell-culture BCIs==
{{Main|Cultured neuronal network}}

Researchers have built devices to interface with neural cells and entire neural networks in cultures outside animals. As well as furthering research on animal implantable devices, experiments on cultured neural tissue have focused on building problem-solving networks, constructing basic computers and manipulating robotic devices. Research into techniques for stimulating and recording from individual neurons grown on semiconductor chips is sometimes referred to as neuroelectronics or [[neurochip]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1051-07.2007|title=Interfacing Neurons with Carbon Nanotubes: Electrical Signal Transfer and Synaptic Stimulation in Cultured Brain Circuits|year=2007|last1=Mazzatenta|first1=A.|last2=Giugliano|first2=M.|last3=Campidelli|first3=S.|last4=Gambazzi|first4=L.|last5=Businaro|first5=L.|last6=Markram|first6=H.|last7=Prato|first7=M.|last8=Ballerini|first8=L.|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=27|pmid=17596441|issue=26|pages=6931–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CaltechNeuroChip.jpg|thumb|The world's first [[Neurochip]], developed by [[Caltech]] researchers Jerome Pine and Michael Maher]]

Development of the first working neurochip was claimed by a Caltech team led by Jerome Pine and Michael Maher in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caltech.edu/news/caltech-scientists-devise-first-neurochip-213 Caltech Scientists Devise First Neurochip], Caltech, 26 October 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The Caltech chip had room for 16 neurons.

In 2003 a team led by Theodore Berger, at the [[University of Southern California]], started work on a neurochip designed to function as an artificial or prosthetic [[hippocampus]]. The neurochip was designed to function in rat brains and was intended as a prototype for the eventual development of higher-brain prosthesis. The hippocampus was chosen because it is thought to be the most ordered and structured part of the brain and is the most studied area. Its function is to encode experiences for storage as long-term memories elsewhere in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/news/technology/medtech/0,65422-0.html Coming to a brain near you]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910201747/http://www.wired.com/news/technology/medtech/0%2C65422-0.html |date=10 September 2006  }}, ''Wired News'', 22 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Thomas DeMarse at the [[University of Florida]] used a culture of 25,000 neurons taken from a rat's brain to fly a [[F-22]] fighter jet [[aircraft simulator]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/11/02/brain.dish/ 'Brain' in a dish flies flight simulator], ''CNN'', 4 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; After collection, the cortical neurons were cultured in a [[petri dish]] and rapidly began to reconnect themselves to form a living neural network. The cells were arranged over a grid of 60 electrodes and used to control the [[Aircraft principal axes|pitch]] and [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw]] functions of the simulator. The study's focus was on understanding how the human brain performs and learns computational tasks at a cellular level.

==Ethical considerations==

* conceptual issues (researchers disagree over what is and what is not a brain-computer interface),&lt;ref name="Neuroethics" /&gt;
* obtaining informed consent from people who have difficulty communicating,
* risk/benefit analysis,
* shared responsibility of BCI teams (e.g. how to ensure that responsible group decisions can be made),
* the consequences of BCI technology for the quality of life of patients and their families,
* side-effects (e.g. neurofeedback of sensorimotor rhythm training is reported to affect sleep quality),
* personal responsibility and its possible constraints (e.g. who is responsible for erroneous actions with a neuroprosthesis),
* issues concerning personality and personhood and its possible alteration,
* blurring of the division between human and machine
* therapeutic applications and their possible exceedance,
* questions of research ethics that arise when progressing from animal experimentation to application in human subjects,
* [[Thought identification|mind-reading]] and privacy,
* [[mind-control]],
* use of the technology in advanced interrogation techniques by governmental authorities,
* selective enhancement and social stratification.
* communication to the media.

In their current form, most BCIs are far removed from the ethical issues considered above. They are actually similar to corrective therapies in function. Clausen stated in 2009 that “BCIs pose ethical challenges, but these are conceptually similar to those that bioethicists have addressed for other realms of therapy”.&lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt; Moreover, he suggests that bioethics is well-prepared to deal with the issues that arise with BCI technologies. Haselager and colleagues&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; pointed out that expectations of BCI efficacy and value play a great role in ethical analysis and the way BCI scientists should approach media. Furthermore, standard protocols can be implemented to ensure ethically sound informed-consent procedures with locked-in patients.

The case of BCIs today has parallels in medicine, as will its evolution. Much as pharmaceutical science began as a balance for impairments and is now used to increase focus and reduce need for sleep, BCIs will likely transform gradually from therapies to enhancements.&lt;ref name= "Attiah"/&gt; Researchers are well aware that sound ethical guidelines, appropriately moderated enthusiasm in media coverage and education about BCI systems will be of utmost importance for the societal acceptance of this technology. Thus, recently more effort is made inside the BCI community to create consensus on ethical guidelines for BCI research, development and dissemination.&lt;ref name="Neuroethics"/&gt;

==Future directions==
[[File:Brain-computer interface.jpeg|thumb|right|Brain-computer interface]]
A consortium consisting of 12 European partners has completed a roadmap to support the European Commission in their funding decisions for the new framework program [[Horizon 2020]]. The project, which was funded by the European Commission, started in November 2013 and ended in April 2015. The roadmap is now complete, and can be downloaded on the [http://bnci-horizon-2020.eu/ project's webpage]. A 2015 publication led by Dr. Clemens Brunner describes some of the analyses and achievements of this project, as well as the emerging Brain-Computer Interface Society.&lt;ref name="bncihorizon2020"&gt;{{cite journal|title=BNCI Horizon 2020: towards a roadmap for the BCI community|doi=10.1080/2326263X.2015.1008956 | volume=2 | journal=Brain-Computer Interfaces|pages=1–10|year=2015 |last1=Brunner |first1=Clemens |last2=Birbaumer |first2=Niels |last3=Blankertz |first3=Benjamin |last4=Guger |first4=Christoph |last5=Kübler |first5=Andrea |last6=Mattia |first6=Donatella |last7=Millán |first7=José del R |last8=Miralles |first8=Felip |last9=Nijholt |first9=Anton |last10=Opisso |first10=Eloy |last11=Ramsey |first11=Nick |last12=Salomon |first12=Patric |last13=Müller-Putz |first13=Gernot R |url=http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/350349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, this article reviewed work within this project that further defined BCIs and applications, explored recent trends, discussed ethical issues, and evaluated different directions for new BCIs. As the article notes, their new roadmap generally extends and supports the recommendations from the Future BNCI project managed by Dr. Brendan Allison, which conveys substantial enthusiasm for emerging BCI directions.

In addition to,&lt;ref name="bncihorizon2020"/&gt; other recent publications have explored the most promising future BCI directions for new groups of disabled users (e.g.,&lt;ref name="Wolpaw, J.R 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allison, B.Z., Dunne, S., Leeb, R., Millan, J., and Nijholt, A. (2013). Towards Practical Brain-Computer Interfaces: Bridging the Gap from Research to Real-World Applications.

Springer Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;). Some prominent examples are summarized below.

===Disorders of consciousness (DOC)===
Some persons have a [[disorder of consciousness]] (DOC). This state is defined to include persons with coma, as well as persons in a vegetative state (VS) or minimally conscious state (MCS). New BCI research seeks to help persons with DOC in different ways. A key initial goal is to identify patients who are able to perform basic cognitive tasks, which would of course lead to a change in their diagnosis. That is, some persons who are diagnosed with DOC may in fact be able to process information and make important life decisions (such as whether to seek therapy, where to live, and their views on end-of-life decisions regarding them). Some persons who are diagnosed with DOC die as a result of end-of-life decisions, which may be made by family members who sincerely feel this is in the patient's best interests. Given the new prospect of allowing these patients to provide their views on this decision, there would seem to be a strong ethical pressure to develop this research direction to guarantee that DOC patients are given an opportunity to decide whether they want to live.&lt;ref&gt;Edlinger, G., Allison, B.Z., and Guger, C. (2015). "How many people could use a BCI system?" pp. 33–66 in ''Clinical Systems Neuroscience'', Kansaku, K., Cohen, L., and Birbaumer, N. (eds.) Springer Verlag Japan: Tokyo. {{ISBN|978-4-431-55037-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3109/02699052.2012.698362|pmid=22759199|title=Brain–computer interfacing in disorders of consciousness|journal=Brain Injury|volume=26|issue=12|pages=1510–22|year=2012|last1=Chatelle|first1=Camille|last2=Chennu|first2=Srivas|last3=Noirhomme|first3=Quentin|last4=Cruse|first4=Damian|last5=Owen|first5=Adrian M.|last6=Laureys|first6=Steven|url=http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/handle/2268/162403|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
These and other articles describe new challenges and solutions to use BCI technology to help persons with DOC. One major challenge is that these patients cannot use BCIs based on vision. Hence, new tools rely on auditory and/or vibrotactile stimuli. Patients may wear headphones and/or vibrotactile stimulators placed on the wrists, neck, leg, and/or other locations. Another challenge is that patients may fade in and out of consciousness, and can only communicate at certain times. This may indeed be a cause of mistaken diagnosis. Some patients may only be able to respond to physicians' requests during a few hours per day (which might not be predictable ahead of time) and thus may have been unresponsive during diagnosis. Therefore, new methods rely on tools that are easy to use in field settings, even without expert help, so family members and other persons without any medical or technical background can still use them. This reduces the cost, time, need for expertise, and other burdens with DOC assessment. Automated tools can ask simple questions that patients can easily answer, such as "Is your father named George?" or "Were you born in the USA?" Automated instructions inform patients that they may convey yes or no by (for example) focusing their attention on stimuli on the right vs. left wrist. This focused attention produces reliable changes in EEG patterns that can help determine that the patient is able to communicate. The results could be presented to physicians and therapists, which could lead to a revised diagnosis and therapy. In addition, these patients could then be provided with BCI-based communication tools that could help them convey basic needs, adjust bed position and [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), and otherwise empower them to make major life decisions and communicate.&lt;ref name=BolyMassimini2012&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boly M, Massimini M, Garrido MI, Gosseries O, Noirhomme Q, Laureys S, Soddu A |title=Brain connectivity in disorders of consciousness |journal=Brain Connectivity |year=2012 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |doi=10.1089/brain.2011.0049|pmid=22512333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2014.00950|title=Multiple tasks and neuroimaging modalities increase the likelihood of detecting covert awareness in patients with disorders of consciousness|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume=8|pages=950|year=2014|last1=Gibson|first1=Raechelle M.|last2=Fernã¡Ndez-Espejo|first2=Davinia|last3=Gonzalez-Lara|first3=Laura E.|last4=Kwan|first4=Benjamin Y.|last5=Lee|first5=Donald H.|last6=Owen|first6=Adrian M.|last7=Cruse|first7=Damian|pmid=25505400|pmc=4244609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00775|pmid=24312041|pmc=3834290|title=On ERPs detection in disorders of consciousness rehabilitation|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume=7|pages=775|year=2013|last1=Risetti|first1=Monica|last2=Formisano|first2=Rita|last3=Toppi|first3=Jlenia|last4=Quitadamo|first4=Lucia R.|last5=Bianchi|first5=Luigi|last6=Astolfi|first6=Laura|last7=Cincotti|first7=Febo|last8=Mattia|first8=Donatella}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This research effort was supported in part by different EU-funded projects, such as the [http://www.decoderproject.eu/ DECODER] project led by Prof. Andrea Kuebler at the [[University of Würzburg|University of Wuerzburg]]. This project contributed to the first BCI system developed for DOC assessment and communication, called [http://www.mindbeagle.at/ mindBEAGLE]. This system is designed to help non-expert users work with DOC patients, but is not intended to replace medical staff. An EU-funded project that began in 2015 called [https://web.archive.org/web/20150518071837/http://www.eurekanetwork.org/fyrom/about/-/journal_content/56/10137/4607160 ComAlert] conducted further research and development to improve DOC prediction, assessment, rehabilitation, and communication, called "PARC" in that project. Another project funded by the National Science Foundation is led by Profs. Dean Krusienski and Chang Nam. This project provides for improved vibrotactile systems, advanced signal analysis, and other improvements for DOC assessment and communication.

===Motor recovery===
People may lose some of their ability to move due to many causes, such as stroke or injury. Several groups have explored systems and methods for motor recovery that include BCIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Remsik|first=Alexander|last2=Young|first2=Brittany|last3=Vermilyea|first3=Rebecca|last4=Kiekhoefer|first4=Laura|last5=Abrams|first5=Jessica|last6=Elmore|first6=Samantha Evander|last7=Schultz|first7=Paige|last8=Nair|first8=Veena|last9=Edwards|first9=Dorothy|date=2016-05-03|title=A review of the progression and future implications of brain-computer interface therapies for restoration of distal upper extremity motor function after stroke|journal=Expert Review of Medical Devices|volume=13|issue=5|pages=445–454|doi=10.1080/17434440.2016.1174572|issn=1743-4440|pmid=27112213|pmc=5131699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Monge-Pereira|first=Esther|last2=Ibañez-Pereda|first2=Jaime|last3=Alguacil-Diego|first3=Isabel M.|last4=Serrano|first4=Jose I.|last5=Spottorno-Rubio|first5=María P.|last6=Molina-Rueda|first6=Francisco|title=Use of Electroencephalography Brain-Computer Interface Systems as a Rehabilitative Approach for Upper Limb Function After a Stroke: A Systematic Review|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1934148217305816|journal=PM&amp;R|language=en|volume=9|issue=9|pages=918–932|doi=10.1016/j.pmrj.2017.04.016|pmid=28512066|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sabathiel|first=Nikolaus|last2=Irimia|first2=Danut C.|last3=Allison|first3=Brendan Z.|last4=Guger|first4=Christoph|last5=Edlinger|first5=Günter|date=2016-07-17|title=Paired Associative Stimulation with Brain-Computer Interfaces: A New Paradigm for Stroke Rehabilitation|journal=Foundations of Augmented Cognition: Neuroergonomics and Operational Neuroscience|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|pages=261–272|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-39955-3_25|isbn=9783319399546}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0079612316300449|last=Riccio|first=A.|last2=Pichiorri|first2=F.|last3=Schettini|first3=F.|last4=Toppi|first4=J.|last5=Risetti|first5=M.|last6=Formisano|first6=R.|last7=Molinari|first7=M.|last8=Astolfi|first8=L.|last9=Cincotti|first9=F.|pages=357–387|language=en|doi=10.1016/bs.pbr.2016.04.018|pmid=27590975|title=Brain-Computer Interfaces: Lab Experiments to Real-World Applications|volume=228|series=Progress in Brain Research|year=2016|isbn=9780128042168}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach, a BCI measures motor activity while the patient imagines or attempts movements as directed by a therapist. The BCI may provide two benefits: (1) if the BCI indicates that a patient is not imagining a movement correctly (non-compliance), then the BCI could inform the patient and therapist; and (2) rewarding feedback such as functional stimulation or the movement of a virtual avatar also depends on the patient's correct movement imagery.

So far, BCIs for motor recovery have relied on the EEG to measure the patient's motor imagery. However, studies have also used fMRI to study different changes in the brain as persons undergo BCI-based stroke rehab training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Várkuti|first=Bálint|last2=Guan|first2=Cuntai|last3=Pan|first3=Yaozhang|last4=Phua|first4=Kok Soon|last5=Ang|first5=Kai Keng|last6=Kuah|first6=Christopher Wee Keong|last7=Chua|first7=Karen|last8=Ang|first8=Beng Ti|last9=Birbaumer|first9=Niels|date=2012-05-29|title=Resting State Changes in Functional Connectivity Correlate With Movement Recovery for BCI and Robot-Assisted Upper-Extremity Training After Stroke|journal=Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=53–62|doi=10.1177/1545968312445910|pmid=22645108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Brittany Mei|last2=Nigogosyan|first2=Zack|last3=Remsik|first3=Alexander|last4=Walton|first4=Léo M.|last5=Song|first5=Jie|last6=Nair|first6=Veena A.|last7=Grogan|first7=Scott W.|last8=Tyler|first8=Mitchell E.|last9=Edwards|first9=Dorothy Farrar|date=2014|title=Changes in functional connectivity correlate with behavioral gains in stroke patients after therapy using a brain-computer interface device|journal=Frontiers in Neuroengineering|language=English|volume=7|pages=25|doi=10.3389/fneng.2014.00025|pmid=25071547|pmc=4086321|issn=1662-6443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future systems might include the fMRI and other measures for real-time control, such as functional near-infrared, probably in tandem with EEGs.

Like the work with BCIs for DOC, this research direction was funded by different public funding mechanisms within the EU and elsewhere. The [http://www.vereproject.eu/ VERE] project included work on a new system for stroke rehabilitation focused on BCIs and advanced virtual environments designed to provide the patient with immersive feedback to foster recovery. This project, and the RecoveriX project that focused exclusively on a new BCI system for stroke patients, contributed to a hardware and software platform called [http://www.recoverix.at/Home RecoveriX]. This system includes a BCI as well as a functional electrical stimulator and virtual feedback. In September 2016, a training facility called a [http://www.recoverix.at/Home recoveriX-gym] opened in Austria, in which therapists use this system to provide motor rehab therapy to persons with stroke.

===Functional brain mapping===
Each year, about 400,000 people undergo [[brain mapping]] during neurosurgery. This procedure is often required for people with tumors or epilepsy that do not respond to medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.pharep.2015.01.016|pmid=25933984|title=Prospects of epileptogenesis prevention|journal=Pharmacological Reports|volume=67|issue=3|pages=663–8|year=2015|last1=Radzik|first1=Iwona|last2=Miziak|first2=Barbara|last3=Dudka|first3=Jarosław|last4=Chrościńska-Krawczyk|first4=Magdalena|last5=Czuczwar|first5=Stanisław J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this procedure, electrodes are placed on the brain to precisely identify the locations of structures and functional areas. Patients may be awake during neurosurgery and asked to perform certain tasks, such as moving fingers or repeating words. This is necessary so that surgeons can remove only the desired tissue while sparing other regions, such as critical movement or language regions. Removing too much brain tissue can cause permanent damage, while removing too little tissue can leave the underlying condition untreated and require additional neurosurgery. Thus, there is a strong need to improve both methods and systems to map the brain as effectively as possible.

In several recent publications, BCI research experts and medical doctors have collaborated to explore new ways to use BCI technology to improve neurosurgical mapping. This work focuses largely on high gamma activity, which is difficult to detect with non-invasive means. Results have led to improved methods for identifying key areas for movement, language, and other functions. A recent article addressed advances in functional brain mapping and summarizes a workshop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2014.09.015|pmid=25461213|title=Proceedings of the Fifth International Workshop on Advances in Electrocorticography|journal=Epilepsy &amp; Behavior|volume=41|pages=183–192|year=2014|last1=Ritaccio|first1=Anthony|last2=Brunner|first2=Peter|last3=Gunduz|first3=Aysegul|last4=Hermes|first4=Dora|last5=Hirsch|first5=Lawrence J.|last6=Jacobs|first6=Joshua|last7=Kamada|first7=Kyousuke|last8=Kastner|first8=Sabine|last9=Knight|first9=Robert T.|last10=Lesser|first10=Ronald P.|last11=Miller|first11=Kai|last12=Sejnowski|first12=Terrence|last13=Worrell|first13=Gregory|last14=Schalk|first14=Gerwin|pmc=4268064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flexible devices===
[[Flexible electronics]] are [[polymer]]s or other flexible materials (e.g. [[silk]],&lt;ref name="KimSilk"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|last1=Kim|first1=DH|title=Dissolvable films of silk fibroin for ultrathin, conformal bio-integrated electronics|volume=9|issue=6|pages=511–517|journal=Nature Materials|doi=10.1038/nmat2745|pmid=20400953|pmc=3034223|bibcode=2010NatMa...9..511K}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pentacene]], [[polydimethylsiloxane|PDMS]], [[parylene]], [[polyimide]]&lt;ref name="Boppart"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1992|last1=Boppart|first1=SA|title=A flexible perforated microelectrode array for extended neural recording|volume=39|issue=1|pages=37–42|journal=IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering|doi=10.1109/10.108125|pmid=1572679}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that are printed with [[electronic circuit|circuitry]]; the flexible nature of the [[organic compound|organic]] background materials allowing the electronics created to bend, and the [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabrication techniques]] utilized to create these devices resembles those used to create [[integrated circuit]]s and [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS).&lt;ref name="Blau"&gt;{{cite book | last = Blau|first = A| publisher = InTech|series = Applied Biomedical Engineering|date=August 2011|chapter = 5|pages = 84–122|url = http://www.intechopen.com/books/applied-biomedical-engineering/prospects-for-neuroprosthetics-flexible-microelectrode-arrays-with-polymer-conductors|doi = 10.5772/23186|isbn =9789533072562|title = Applied Biomedical Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flexible electronics were first developed in the 1960s and 1970s, but research interest increased in the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name="KimBME"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|last1=Kim|first1=DH|title=Flexible and stretchable electronics for bio-integrated devices|volume=14|pages=113–128|journal=Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering|doi = 10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071811-150018|pmid=22524391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neural dust===
Neural dust is a term used to refer to millimeter-sized devices operated as [[Wireless power transfer|wirelessly powered]] nerve sensors that were proposed in a 2011 paper from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] Wireless Research Center, which described both the challenges and outstanding benefits of creating a long lasting wireless BCI.&lt;ref name=Rabaey&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rabaey|first=J.

'''Calcium pumps''' are a family of [[ion transporter]]s found in the [[cell membrane]] of all animal cells. They are responsible for the [[active transport]] of [[calcium]] out of the cell for the maintenance of the steep Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; [[electrochemical gradient]] across the cell membrane. Calcium pumps play a crucial role in proper [[cell signalling]] by keeping the intracellular calcium concentration roughly 10,000 times lower than the extracellular concentration.&lt;ref name="Carafoli"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carafoli E |title=Calcium pump of the plasma membrane |journal=Physiol.

== Biological role ==
{{main article|Calcium in biology}}
Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; has many important roles as an intracellular messenger. The release of a large amount of free Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can trigger a fertilized egg to develop, skeletal muscle cells to contract, secretion by secretory cells and interactions with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; -responsive proteins like calmodulin. To maintain low concentrations of free Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the cytosol, cells use membrane pumps like calcium ATPase found in the membranes of sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle. These pumps are needed to provide the steep electrochemical gradient that allows Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to rush into the cytosol when a stimulus signal opens the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels in the membrane. The pumps are also necessary to actively pump the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; back out of the cytoplasm and return the cell to its pre-signal state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alberts|first1=Bruce|last2=Bray|first2=Dennis|last3=Hopkin|first3=Karen|last4=Johnson|first4=Alexander D|last5=Lewis|first5=Julian|last6=Raff|first6=Martin|last7=Roberts|first7=Keith|last8=Walter|first8=Peter|title=Essential Cell Biology|date=2009|publisher=Garland Science|location=New York|isbn=978-0815341291|pages=552–553|edition=3rd}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crystallography of calcium pumps==
The structure of calcium pumps found in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle was elucidated in 2000 by Toyoshima, et al. using microscopy of tubular crystals and 3D microcrystals. The pump has a molecular mass of 110,000 [[atomic mass unit|amu]], shows three well separated cytoplasmic domains, with a transmembrane domain consisting of ten alpha helices and two transmembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; binding sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Toyoshima|first1=Chikashi|last2=Nakasako|first2=Masayoshi|last3=Nomura|first3=Hiromi|last4=Ogawa|first4=Haruo|title=Crystal structure of the calcium pump of sarcoplasmic reticulum at 2.6 Å resolution|journal=Nature|date=8 June 2000|volume=405|issue=6787|pages=647–655|doi=10.1038/35015017|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v405/n6787/full/405647a0.html|accessdate=28 March 2016|pmid=10864315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cascading failure''' is a process in a system of [[interconnection|interconnected]] parts in which the failure of one or few parts can trigger the failure of other parts and so on. Such a failure may happen in many types of systems, including power transmission, computer networking, finance, human body systems, and transportation systems.

Cascading failures may occur when one part of the system fails. When this happens, other parts must then compensate for the failed component. This in turn overloads these nodes, causing them to fail as well, prompting additional nodes to fail one after another.

== Cascading failure in power transmission ==

Cascading failure is common in [[power grid]]s when one of the elements fails (completely or partially) and shifts its load to nearby elements in the system.  Those nearby elements are then pushed beyond their capacity so they become overloaded and shift their load onto other elements.  Cascading failure is a common effect seen in [[high voltage]] systems, where a [[single point of failure]] (SPF) on a fully loaded or slightly overloaded system results in a sudden spike across all nodes of the system. This surge current can induce the already overloaded nodes into failure, setting off more overloads and thereby taking down the entire system in a very short time.

This failure process cascades through the elements of the system like a ripple on a pond and continues until substantially all of the elements in the system are compromised and/or the system becomes functionally disconnected from the source of its load. For example, under certain conditions a large power grid can collapse after the failure of a single transformer.

Monitoring the operation of a system, in [[real-time computing|real-time]], and judicious disconnection of parts can help stop a cascade.  Another common technique is to calculate a safety margin for the system by computer simulation of possible failures, to establish safe operating levels below which none of the calculated scenarios is predicted to cause cascading failure, and to identify the parts of the network which are most likely to cause cascading failures.&lt;ref name="chao"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zhai|first1=Chao|title=Modeling and Identification of Worst-Case Cascading Failures in Power Systems|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05232.pdf|publisher=Cornell University Library|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary problems with preventing electrical grid failures is that the speed of the control signal is no faster than the speed of the propagating power overload, i.e. since both the control signal and the electrical power are moving at the same speed, it is not possible to isolate the outage by sending a warning ahead to isolate the element.

The question if power grid  failures are correlated have been studied in Daqing Li et al&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daqing|first=Li|last2=Yinan|first2=Jiang|last3=Rui|first3=Kang|last4=Havlin|first4=Shlomo|date=2014-06-20|title=Spatial correlation analysis of cascading failures: Congestions and Blackouts|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep05381|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=4|issue=1|doi=10.1038/srep05381|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2014NatSR...4E5381D}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by Paul DH Hines et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hines|first=Paul D.

== Cascading failure in computer networks ==

Cascading failures can also occur in [[computer network]]s (such as the [[Internet]]) in which [[Network traffic control|network traffic]] is severely impaired or halted to or between larger sections of the network, caused by failing or disconnected hardware or software. In this context, the cascading failure is known by the term '''cascade failure'''. A cascade failure can affect large groups of people and systems.

The cause of a cascade failure is usually the overloading of a single, crucial [[Router (computing)|router]] or node, which causes the node to go down, even briefly. It can also be caused by taking a node down for maintenance or upgrades. In either case, traffic is [[routing|routed]] to or through another (alternative) path. This alternative path, as a result, becomes overloaded, causing it to go down, and so on. It will also affect systems which depend on the node for regular operation.

=== Symptoms ===

The symptoms of a cascade failure include: [[packet loss]] and high network [[lag|latency]], not just to single systems, but to whole sections of a network or the internet. The high latency and packet loss is caused by the nodes that fail to operate due to [[congestion collapse]], which causes them to still be present in the network but without much or any useful communication going through them. As a result, routes can still be considered valid, without them actually providing communication.

If enough routes go down because of a cascade failure, a complete section of the network or internet can become unreachable. Although undesired, this can help speed up the recovery from this failure as connections will time out, and other nodes will give up trying to establish connections to the section(s) that have become cut off, decreasing load on the involved nodes.

A common occurrence during a cascade failure is a '''walking failure''', where sections go down, causing the next section to fail, after which the first section comes back up. This '''ripple''' can make several passes through the same sections or connecting nodes before stability is restored.

=== History ===

Cascade failures are a relatively recent development, with the massive increase in traffic and the high interconnectivity between systems and networks. The term was first applied in this context in the late 1990s by a Dutch IT professional and has slowly become a relatively common term for this kind of large-scale failure.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

=== Example ===

Network failures typically start when a single network node fails. Initially, the traffic that would normally go through the node is stopped. Systems and users get errors about not being able to reach hosts. Usually, the redundant systems of an ISP respond very quickly, choosing another path through a different backbone. The routing path through this alternative route is longer, with more [[Hop (telecommunications)|hops]] and subsequently going through more systems that normally do not process the amount of traffic suddenly offered.

This can cause one or more systems along the alternative route to go down, creating similar problems of their own.

Also, related systems are affected in this case. As an example, [[Domain name system|DNS]] resolution might fail and what would normally cause systems to be interconnected, might break connections that are not even directly involved in the actual systems that went down. This, in turn, may cause seemingly unrelated nodes to develop problems, that can cause another cascade failure all on its own.

In December 2012, a partial loss (40%) of [[GMail]] service occurred globally, for 18 minutes. This loss of service was caused by a routine update of load balancing software which contained faulty logic—in this case, the error was caused by logic using an [https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/12/why-gmail-went-down-google-misconfigured-chromes-sync-server/ inappropriate ''all'' instead of the more appropriate ''some''.] The cascading error was fixed by fully updating a single node in the network instead of partially updating all nodes at one time.

== Cascading structural failure ==
Certain load-bearing structures with discrete structural components can be subject to the "zipper effect", where the failure of a single structural member increases the load on adjacent members.  In the case of the [[Hyatt Regency walkway collapse]], a suspended walkway (which was already overstressed due to an error in construction) failed when a single vertical suspension rod failed, overloading the neighboring rods which failed sequentially (i.e. like a [[zipper]]). A bridge that can have such a failure is called [[fracture critical]], and numerous bridge collapses have been caused by the failure of a single part. Properly designed structures use an adequate [[factor of safety]] and/or alternate load paths to prevent this type of mechanical cascade failure.&lt;ref name="petroski"&gt;{{cite book| title=To Engineer Is Human: The Role of Failure in Structural Design| first=Henry| last=Petroski| year=1992| isbn=978-0-679-73416-1| publisher=Vintage| place=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biochemical cascade]]s exist in biology, where a small reaction can have system-wide implications. One negative example is [[ischemic cascade]], in which a small [[ischemia|ischemic]] attack releases [[toxin]]s which kill off far more cells than the initial damage, resulting in more toxins being released. Current research is to find a way to block this cascade in [[stroke]] patients to minimize the damage.

In the study of extinction, sometimes the extinction of one species will cause many other extinctions to happen. Such a species is known as a [[keystone species]].

=== Electronics ===
Another example is the [[Cockcroft–Walton generator]], which can also experience cascade failures wherein one failed [[diode]] can result in all the diodes failing in a fraction of a second.

Yet another example of this effect in a scientific experiment was the [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] in 2001 of several thousand fragile glass photomultiplier tubes used in the [[Super-Kamiokande]] experiment, where the shock wave caused by the failure of a single detector appears to have triggered the implosion of the other detectors in a chain reaction.

=== Finance ===
{{main|Systemic risk}}
In [[finance]], the risk of cascading failures of financial institutions is referred to as ''[[systemic risk]]:'' the failure of one financial institution may cause other financial institutions (its [[Counterparty|counterparties]]) to fail, cascading throughout the system.&lt;ref name="HuangVodenska2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Xuqing|last2=Vodenska|first2=Irena|last3=Havlin|first3=Shlomo|last4=Stanley|first4=H. Eugene|title=Cascading Failures in Bi-partite Graphs: Model for Systemic Risk Propagation|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=3|year=2013|issn=2045-2322|doi=10.1038/srep01219|pmid=23386974|pmc=3564037|arxiv=1210.4973|bibcode=2013NatSR...3E1219H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Institutions that are believed to pose systemic risk are deemed either "[[too big to fail]]" (TBTF) or "too interconnected to fail" (TICTF), depending on why they appear to pose a threat.

Note however that systemic risk is not due to individual institutions per se, but due to the interconnections.

A related (though distinct) type of cascading failure in finance occurs in the stock market, exemplified by the [[2010 Flash Crash]].

== Interdependent cascading failures ==
[[File:Interdependent-cascading-failures2.png|thumb|305x305px]]
Diverse infrastructures such as water supply, transportation, fuel and power stations are coupled together. Owing to this coupling, interdependent networks are extremely sensitive to random failure, and in particular to targeted attacks, such that a failure of a small fraction of nodes from one network can produce an iterative cascade of failures in several interdependent networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from  Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack|url=http://empcommission.org/docs/A2473-EMP_Commission-7MB.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rinaldi|first=S.M.|last2=Peerenboom|first2=J.P.|last3=Kelly|first3=T.K.|date=2001|title=Identifying, understanding, and analyzing critical infrastructure interdependencies|url=|journal=IEEE Control Syst.|volume=21|pages=11–25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical blackouts frequently result from a cascade of failures between interdependent networks, and the problem has been dramatically exemplified by the several large-scale blackouts that have occurred in recent years. Blackouts are a fascinating demonstration of the important role played by the dependencies between networks. For example, the September 28, 2003 blackout in Italy resulted in a widespread failure of the railway network, health care systems, and financial services and, in addition, severely influenced the communication networks. The partial failure of the communication system in turn further impaired the power grid management system, thus producing a positive feedback on the power grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=V. Rosato |first=Issacharoff, L., Tiriticco, F., Meloni, S., Porcellinis, S.D., &amp; Setola, R. |title=Modelling interdependent infrastructures using interacting dynamical models |journal=International Journal of Critical Infrastructures |year=2008 |volume=4 |pages=63–79 |url=http://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJCIS.2008.016092 |doi=10.1504/IJCIS.2008.016092 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This example emphasizes how inter-dependence can significantly magnify the damage in an interacting network system. A framework to study the cascading failures between coupled networks  based on percolation theory was developed recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=S. V. Buldyrev|first=R. Parshani, G. Paul, H.

Furthermore, it was shown that such systems when embedded in space are extremely vulnerable to localized attacks or failures. Above a critical radius of damage, the failure may spread to the entire system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berezin|first=Yehiel|last2=Bashan|first2=Amir|last3=Danziger|first3=Michael M.|last4=Li|first4=Daqing|last5=Havlin|first5=Shlomo|date=2015-03-11|title=Localized attacks on spatially embedded networks with dependencies|url=https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/25757572|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.1038/srep08934|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2015NatSR...5E8934B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18325">The '''Earth Charter''' is an international declaration of fundamental values and principles considered useful by its supporters for building a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. Created by a global consultation process, and endorsed by organizations representing millions of people, the Charter "seeks to inspire in all peoples a sense of global interdependence and shared responsibility for the well-being of the human family, the greater community of life, and future generations."&lt;ref&gt;Earth Charter Initiative: [http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/pages/What-is-the-Earth-Charter%3F.html "What is the Earth Charter?"].&lt;/ref&gt; It calls upon humanity to help create a global partnership at a critical juncture in history. The Earth Charter's ethical vision proposes that [[environmental protection]], [[human rights]], equitable [[Human development (humanity)|human development]], and [[world peace|peace]] are interdependent and indivisible. The Charter attempts to provide a new framework for thinking about and addressing these issues. The [[Earth Charter Initiative]] organization exists to promote the Charter.

==History==
The idea of the Earth Charter originated in 1987, by [[Maurice Strong]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] as members of The [[Club of Rome]], when the [[United Nations]] [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] called for a new charter to guide the transition to [[sustainable development]]. In 1992, the need for a charter was urged by then-[[Secretary General of the United Nations|Secretary General]] [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] at the [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[Earth Summit]], but the time for such a declaration was not believed to be right. The [[Rio Declaration]] became the statement of the achievable consensus at that time. In 1994, [[Maurice Strong]] (Chairman of the Earth Summit) and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], working through organizations they each founded (the [[Earth Council]] and [[Green Cross International]] respectively), restarted the Earth Charter as a [[civil society]] initiative, with the help of the government of the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="mstrong"&gt;Maurice Strong: [http://www.mauricestrong.net/2009013070/earth-charter.html "History of the Earth Charter"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong died in November 2015.&lt;ref name="mstrong" /&gt;

"The Ark of Hope was created for a celebration of the Earth Charter held at Shelburne Farms, Vermont on September 9, 2001."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkofhope.org|title=Welcome|author=|date=|website=www.arkofhope.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drafting==
The drafting of the text was done during a six-year worldwide consultation process (1994–2000), overseen by the independent Earth Charter Commission, which was convened by Strong and Gorbachev with the purpose of developing a global consensus on values and principles for a sustainable future. The Commission continues to serve as the steward of the Earth Charter text.

One of the members of the Earth Charter Commission and Steering Committee was [[Steven Clark Rockefeller]], who, among other things is professor emeritus of Religion at [[Middlebury College]] and an advisory trustee of the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Steven C. Rockefeller |url=http://earthcharter.org/about/steven-c-rockefeller/ |website=earthcharter.org |accessdate=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2001 interview with Rockefeller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abroadview.org/stories/interviews/rockefeller.htm|title=Charting a New Course: An Interview with Steven Rockefeller|last=Schwarz|first=Sherry|date=2001|website=abroadview.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502055548/http://www.abroadview.org/stories/interviews/rockefeller.htm|archivedate=2 May 2008|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he "chaired the Earth Charter international drafting committee". Other members included [[Amadou Toumani Touré]] (Mali), [[Princess Basma bint Talal]] (Jordan), [[Mohamed Sahnoun]] (Algeria), [[A. T. Ariyaratne]] (Sri Lanka), [[Wakako Hironaka]] (Japan), [[Erna Witoelar]] (Indonesia), [[Ruud Lubbers]] (The Netherlands), [[Federico Mayor]] (Spain), [[Mercedes Sosa]] (Argentina), [[Leonardo Boff]] (Brazil), [[Yolanda Kakabadse]] (Ecuador), [[Shridath Ramphal]] (Guyana), [[Elizabeth May]] (Canada), [[Severn Cullis-Suzuki]] (Canada), and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commission |url=http://earthcharter.org/about-eci/commission/ |website=earthcharter.org |accessdate=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final text of the Earth Charter was approved at a meeting of the Earth Charter Commission at the [[UNESCO]] headquarters in Paris in March 2000. The official launch was on 29 June 2000 in a ceremony at The [[Peace Palace]] in [[The Hague]], Netherlands. [[Queen Beatrix]] of the Netherlands attended the ceremony.

== Contents ==
The approximately 2,400 word document is divided into sections (called pillars), which have sixteen main principles containing sixty-one supporting principles.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Dower, University of Aberdeen (2004): [http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/invent/images/uploads/The%20Earth%20Charter%20as%20a%20Global%20Ethic.pdf "The Earth Charter as a Global Ethic"], p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt;  The document opens with a preamble and ends with a conclusion entitled “The Way Forward”.

===Preamble===
{{cquote|We stand at a critical moment in Earth's history, a time when humanity must choose its future. As the world becomes increasingly interdependent and fragile, the future at once holds great peril and great promise. To move forward we must recognize that in the midst of a magnificent diversity of cultures and life forms we are one human family and one Earth community with a common destiny. We must join together to bring forth a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature, universal human rights, economic justice, and a culture of peace. Towards this end, it is imperative that we, the peoples of Earth, declare our responsibility to one another, to the greater community of life, and to future generations.&lt;ref name="ECdoc"&gt;Earth Charter Initiative: [http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/pages/Read-the-Charter.html "Text of the Earth Charter"].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Principles ===
The four pillars and sixteen principles of the Earth Charter are:&lt;ref name="ECdoc" /&gt;

'''I. Respect and Care for the Community of Life'''
:1. Respect Earth and life in all its diversity.
:2. Care for the community of life with understanding, compassion and love.
:3. Build democratic societies that are just, participatory, sustainable and peaceful.
:4. Secure Earth's bounty and beauty for present and future generations.

'''II. Ecological Integrity'''
:5. Protect and restore the integrity of Earth's ecological systems, with special concern for biological diversity and the natural processes that sustain life.
:6. Prevent harm as the best method of environmental protection and, when knowledge is limited, apply a precautionary approach.
:7. Adopt patterns of production, consumption and reproduction that safeguard Earth's regenerative capacities, human rights and community well-being.
:8. Advance the study of ecological sustainability and promote the open exchange and wide application of the knowledge acquired.

'''III. Social and Economic Justice'''
:9. Eradicate poverty as an ethical, social and environmental imperative.
:10. Ensure that economic activities and institutions at all levels promote human development in an equitable and sustainable manner.
:11. Affirm gender equality and equity as prerequisites to sustainable development and ensure universal access to education, health care and economic opportunity.
:12. Uphold the right of all, without discrimination, to a natural and social environment supportive of human dignity, bodily health and spiritual well-being, with special attention to the rights of indigenous peoples and minorities.

'''IV. Democracy, Nonviolence, and Peace'''
:13. Strengthen democratic institutions at all levels, and provide transparency and accountability in governance, inclusive participation in decision-making, and access to justice.
:14. Integrate into formal education and lifelong learning the knowledge, values and skills needed for a sustainable way of life.
:15. Treat all living beings with respect and consideration.

The Charter has received opposition from several groups. For example, in the [[United States]], members of religious groups, such as the [[Christian right|Religious Right]] have objected to the document on the grounds that it is [[secularism|secular]], and espouses [[socialism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009| reason=Please, provide a reliable source for this assertion. Nowhere on the Internet, I could find the mentioned objections.}} In addition, some conservatives{{Who|date=November 2009}} cite an informal comment by Mikhail Gorbachev that the document is "a kind of [[Ten Commandments]]" and point to the fact that at the 2002 [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], a copy of the document was placed symbolically in an "Ark of Hope" — an independent project by the American artist Sally Linder.

Earth Charter International, the organization responsible for promoting the Charter, states in its literature that the Earth Charter is respectful and inclusive of all religious traditions. They say that the Charter itself makes no statements to support claims of intent to supplant any of the world's religions or to create a world government. ECI asserts that the Charter is a statement of common ethical values towards sustainability, that recognizes humanity's shared responsibility to the Earth and to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Earth Charter Initiative.

An '''earthworm''' is a tube-shaped, segmented [[worm]] found in the phylum [[Annelid]]a. They are commonly found living in soil, feeding on live and dead organic matter. An earthworm's digestive system runs through the length of its body. It conducts respiration through its skin. It has a double transport system composed of [[Coelom#Coelomic fluid|coelomic fluid]] that moves within the fluid-filled [[coelom]] and a simple, closed blood circulatory system. It has a central and a peripheral nervous system. The central nervous system consists of two ganglia above the mouth, one on either side, connected to a nerve cord running back along its length to motor neurons and sensory cells in each segment. Large numbers of chemoreceptors are concentrated near its mouth. Circumferential and longitudinal muscles on the periphery of each segment enable the worm to move. Similar sets of muscles line the gut, and their actions move the digesting food toward the worm's anus.&lt;ref name="Integrated Principles of Zoology"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Cleveland P. Hickman Jr., Larry S. Roberts, Frances M Hickman|title=Integrated Principles of Zoology|year=1984|edition=7th|publisher=Times Mirror/Mosby College Publishing|isbn=978-0-8016-2173-4|page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earthworms are [[hermaphrodite]]s: each individual carries both male and female sex organs. As invertebrates, they lack either an internal [[skeleton]] or [[exoskeleton]], but maintain their structure with fluid-filled coelom chambers that function as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]].

"Earthworm" is the common name for the largest members of [[Oligochaeta]] (which is either a class or a subclass depending on the author). In classical systems, they were placed in the order Opisthopora, on the basis of the male pores opening posterior to the female pores, though the internal male segments are anterior to the female. Theoretical [[Cladistics|cladistic]] studies have placed them, instead, in the suborder Lumbricina of the order Haplotaxida, but this may again soon change. Folk names for the earthworm include "dew-worm", "rainworm", "night crawler", and "angleworm" (due to its use as [[fishing bait]]).

Larger terrestrial earthworms are also called '''megadriles''' (which translates to "big worms"), as opposed to the microdriles ("small worms") in the semiaquatic families [[Tubificidae]], [[Lumbricidae]], and [[Enchytraeidae]], among others. The megadriles are characterized by having a distinct [[clitellum]] (which is more extensive than that of microdriles) and a vascular system with true capillaries.

Earthworms are far less abundant in disturbed environments and are typically active only if water is present.&lt;ref name="brady"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nyle C. Brady |author2=Ray R. Weil |title =Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils (3rd Edition)|publisher =Prentice Hall|year =2009|page=|isbn =978-0-13-501433-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anatomy ==

=== Form and function ===
[[File:Earthworm head.svg|450px|thumb|Earthworm head]]
Depending on the species, an adult earthworm can be from {{convert|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide to {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and over {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide, but the typical ''[[Lumbricus terrestris]]'' grows to about {{convert|360|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.{{sfn|Blakemore|2012|p=xl}} Probably the longest worm on confirmed records is ''[[Amynthas mekongianus]]'' that extends up to 3&amp;nbsp;m (10&amp;nbsp;ft) &lt;ref name ="Blakemore et al., 2007 page 23"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[R.J. Blakemore et al.]] |year=2007 |title=Megascolex (Promegascolex) mekongianus Cognetti, 1922 – its extent, ecology and allocation to Amynthas (Clitellata/Oligochaeta: Megascolecidae) |publisher=Opuscula Zoologica |url=http://opuscula.elte.hu/PDF/Tomus36/3_Blakemore.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the mud along the banks of the 4,350&amp;nbsp;km (2,703&amp;nbsp;mi) Mekong River in Southeast Asia.

From front to back, the basic shape of the earthworm is a cylindrical tube, divided into a series of segments (called [[metamerism (biology)|metamerisms]]) that compartmentalize the body. Furrows are generally{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=11}} externally visible on the body demarking the segments; dorsal pores and nephridiopores exude a fluid that moistens and protects the worm's surface, allowing it to breathe. Except for the mouth and anal segments, each segment carries bristle-like hairs called lateral [[seta]]e{{sfn|Sims|Gerard|1985|pp=3–6}} used to anchor parts of the body during movement;{{sfn|Edwards|Bholen|1996|p=3}} species may have four pairs of setae on each segment or more than eight sometimes forming a complete circle of setae per segment.{{sfn|Sims|Gerard|1985|pp=3–6}} Special ventral setae are used to anchor mating earthworms by their penetration into the bodies of their mates.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Generally, within a species, the number of segments found is consistent across specimens, and individuals are born with the number of segments they will have throughout their lives. The first body segment (segment number 1) features both the earthworm's mouth, overhanging the mouth, a fleshy lobe called the [[prostomium]] , which seals the entrance when the worm is at rest, but is also used to feel and chemically sense the worm's surroundings. Some species of earthworm can even use the prehensile prostomium to grab and drag items such as grasses and leaves into their burrow.

An adult earthworm develops a belt-like glandular swelling, called the [[clitellum]], which covers several segments toward the front part of the animal. This is part of the reproductive system and produces egg capsules. The [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] is most commonly cylindrical like the rest of the body, but depending on the species, may also be quadrangular, octagonal, trapezoidal, or flattened.  The last segment is called the [[periproct]]; the earthworm's anus, a short vertical slit, is found on this segment.{{sfn|Sims|Gerard|1985|pp=3–6}}

[[File:Annelid redone w white background.svg|700px|center|A segment of an earthworm posterior to the clitellum including all of the segmental structures]]

The exterior of an individual segment is a thin [[cuticle]] over skin, commonly pigmented red to brown, which has specialized cells that secrete mucus over the cuticle to keep the body moist and ease movement through soil. Under the skin is a layer of nerve tissue, and two layers of muscles—a thin outer layer of circular muscle, and a much thicker inner layer of longitudinal muscle.{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=8-9}} Interior to the muscle layer is a fluid-filled chamber called a [[coelom]]{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=1}} that by its pressurization provides structure to the worm's boneless body. The segments are separated from each other by septa (the plural of "septum"){{sfn|Sims|Gerard|1985|p=8}} which are perforated transverse walls, allowing the coelomic fluid to pass between segments.{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=12}}  A pair of structures called [[nephrostome]]s are located at the back of each septum; a nephric tubule leads from each nephrostome through the septum and into the following segment.  This tubule then leads to the main body fluid filtering organ, the [[nephridium]] or metanephridium, which removes metabolic waste from the [[Coelom#Coelomic fluid|coelomic fluid]] and expels it through pores called nephridiopores on the worm's sides; usually two nephridia (sometimes more) are found in most segments.{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=6}} At the center of a worm is the [[Alimentary canal|digestive tract]], which runs straight through from mouth to anus without coiling, and is flanked above and below by blood vessels (the dorsal blood vessel and the ventral blood vessel as well as a subneural blood vessel) and the [[ventral nerve cord]], and is surrounded in each segment by a pair of pallial blood vessels that connect the dorsal to the subneural blood vessels.

Many earthworms can eject coelomic fluid through pores in the back in response to stress; Australian ''Didymogaster sylvaticus'' (known as the "blue squirter earthworm") can squirt fluid as high as {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name ="Meet the squirting earthworm"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Myrmecofourmis]] |year=2018 |title=Meet the squirting earthworm |publisher=Youtube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuQEAuM9De8 |format=[[video]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=12}}

=== Nervous system ===
[[File:Earthworm nervous system.png|thumb|280px|Nervous system of the anterior end of an earthworm]]
The nervous system of an earthworm is segmented and comprises three parts: the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), [[peripheral nervous system]] and the [[sympathetic nervous system]].&lt;ref name="HSBE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Brain – Invertebrate Brain – Ganglia, Nervous, System, and Head|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/1009/Brain-Invertebrate-brain.html#ixzz3WG2hsy30|publisher=HSBE|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Priy"&gt;{{cite web|author=Priyadarshini, S.|url=http://www.biologydiscussion.com/neural-control/different-parts-of-nervous-system-of-earthworm-with-diagram/5017|title=Different parts of nervous system of earthworm (with diagram)|publisher=Biology Discussion|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Central nervous system ====
The CNS consists of a bilobed [[brain]] (cerebral [[Ganglion|ganglia]], or [[supra-pharyngeal ganglion]]), sub-pharyngeal ganglia, circum-pharyngeal connectives and a [[ventral nerve cord]].

Earthworms' brains consist of a pair of pear-shaped cerebral ganglia.  These are located in the dorsal side of the [[alimentary canal]] in the third segment, in a groove between the [[buccal cavity]] and [[pharynx]].

A pair of circum-pharyngeal connectives from the brain encircle the pharynx and then connect with a pair of sub-pharyngeal ganglia located below the pharynx in the fourth segment. This arrangement means the brain, sub-pharyngeal ganglia and the circum-pharyngeal connectives form a nerve ring around the pharynx.

The ventral nerve cord (formed by nerve cells and nerve fibres) begins at the sub-pharyngeal ganglia and extends below the alimentary canal to the most posterior body segment. The ventral nerve cord has a swelling, or ganglion, in each segment, i.e. a segmental ganglion, which occurs from the fifth to the last segment of the body.  There are also three [[Axons|giant axons]], one medial giant axon (MGA) and two lateral giant axons (LGAs) on the mid-dorsal side of the ventral nerve cord.  The MGA is 0.07&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter and transmits in an anterior-posterior direction at a rate of 32.2&amp;nbsp;m/s. The LGAs are slightly wider at 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter and transmit in a posterior-anterior direction at 12.6&amp;nbsp;m/s.  The two LGAs are connected at regular intervals along the body and are therefore considered one giant axon.&lt;ref name="expt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/comparingNerveSpeed#prettyPhoto|title=Experiment: Comparing speeds of two nerve fiber sizes|publisher=BackyardBrains|accessdate=April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drewes"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Giant nerve fibre activity in intact, freely moving earthworms|author=Drewes, C.D., Landa, K.B. and McFall, J.L.|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=72|pages=217–227|year=1978|pmid=624897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Peripheral nervous system ====
*Eight to ten nerves arise from the cerebral ganglia to supply the prostomium, buccal chamber and pharynx.
*Three pairs of nerves arise from the subpharyangeal ganglia to supply the 2nd, 3rd and 4th segment.
*Three pairs of nerves extend from each [[segmental ganglia]] to supply various structures of the segment.

==== Sympathetic nervous system ====
The sympathetic nervous system consists of nerve plexuses in the epidermis and alimentary canal. (A plexus is a web of nerve cells
connected together in a two dimensional grid.)  The nerves that run along the body wall pass between the outer circular and inner longitudinal muscle layers of the wall. They give off branches that form the intermuscular plexus and the subepidermal plexus. These nerves connect with the circumpharyngeal connective.

==== Movement ====
On the surface, crawling speed varies both within and among individuals.  Earthworms crawl faster primarily by taking longer "strides" and a greater frequency of strides.  Larger ''Lumbricus terrestris'' worms crawl at a greater absolute speed than smaller worms.  They achieve this by taking slightly longer strides but with slightly lower stride frequencies.&lt;ref name="Quillin"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kinematic scaling of locomotion by hydrostatic animals: ontogeny of peristaltic crawling by the earthworm lumbricus terrestris|author=Quillin, K.J.|year=1999|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=202|pages=661–674|pmid=10021320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Touching an earthworm, which causes a "pressure" response as well as (often) a response to the dehydrating quality of the salt on human skin (toxic to earthworms), stimulates the subepidermal nerve plexus which connects to the intermuscular plexus and causes the longitudinal muscles to contact, thereby the writhing movements when we pick up an earthworm. This behaviour is a [[reflex]] and does not require the CNS; it occurs even if the nerve cord is removed. Each segment of the earthworm has its own nerve plexus.  The plexus of one segment is not connected directly to that of adjacent segments.  The nerve cord is required to connect the nervous systems of the segments.&lt;ref name="Cronodon"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Cronodon|title=Earthworm-nervous system|url=http://cronodon.com/BioTech/Earthworm_NS.html|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The giant axons carry the fastest signals along the nerve cord.  These are emergency signals that initiate reflex escape behaviours. The larger dorsal giant axon conducts signals the fastest, from the rear to the front of the animal.  If the rear of the worm is touched, a signal is rapidly sent forwards causing the longitudinal muscles in each segment to contract.  This causes the worm to shorten very quickly as an attempt to escape from a predator or other potential threat. The two medial giant axons connect with each other and send signals from the front to the rear.  Stimulation of these causes the earthworm to very quickly retreat (perhaps contracting into its burrow to escape a bird).

The presence of a nervous system is essential for an animal to be able to experience [[nociception]] or [[Pain in invertebrates|pain]]. However, other physiological capacities are also required such as opioid sensitivity and central modulation of responses by analgesics.&lt;ref name="Elwood"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=ILAR Journal|year=2011|volume=52|issue=2|pages=175–84|title=Pain and suffering in invertebrates?|author=
Elwood, R.W.|pmid=21709310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Enkephalin]] and [[α-endorphin]]-like substances have been found in earthworms.  Injections of [[naloxone]] (an opioid antagonist) inhibit the escape responses of earthworms.  This indicates that opioid substances play a role in sensory modulation, similar to that found in many vertebrates.&lt;ref name="ILAR"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://ilarjournal.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/1-2/25.full|journal=ILAR Journal|volume=33|issue=1–2|pages=25–31|title=A question of pain in invertebrates|author=Smith, J.A.|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photosensitivity ===
Earthworms do not have eyes (although some worms do), however, they do have specialised photosensitive cells called "light cells of Hess".  These photoreceptor cells have a central intracellular cavity ([[phaosome]]) filled with [[microvilli]].  As well as the microvilli, there are several sensory [[cilia]] in the phaosome which are structurally independent of the microvilli.&lt;ref name="eyes"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Zeitschrift für Zellforschung und Mikroskopische Anatomie|year=1970|volume=104|issue=3|pages=345–357|title=Fine structure of photoreceptor cells in the earthworm, ''Lumbricus terrestris''|author=Röhlich, P., Aros, B. and Virágh, Sz.|doi=10.1007/BF00335687}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The photoreceptors are distributed in most parts of the epidermis but are more concentrated on the back and sides of the worm.  A relatively small number occur on the ventral surface of the 1st segment. They are most numerous in the prostomium and reduce in density in the first three segments; they are very few in number past the third segment.&lt;ref name="Cronodon" /&gt;

=== Digestive system ===

The [[Alimentary canal|gut]] of the earthworm is a straight tube which extends from the worm's mouth to its anus.  It is differentiated into a buccal cavity (generally running through the first one or two segments of the earthworm), pharynx (running generally about four segments in length), esophagus, crop, gizzard (usually) and intestine.{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=13}}

Food enters in the mouth. The pharynx acts as a suction pump; its muscular walls draw in food. In the pharynx, the pharyngeal glands secrete mucus. Food moves into the esophagus, where calcium (from the blood and ingested from previous meals) is pumped in to maintain proper blood calcium levels in the blood and food pH. From there the food passes into the crop and gizzard. In the gizzard, strong muscular contractions grind the food with the help of mineral particles ingested along with the food. Once through the gizzard, food continues through the intestine for digestion. The intestine secretes [[Pepsin]] to digest proteins, [[Amylase]] to digest polysaccharides, [[Cellulase]] to digest cellulose, and lipase to digest fats.&lt;ref name="Integrated Principles of Zoology" /&gt; Earthworms use, in addition to the digestive proteins, a class of surface active compounds called [[drilodefensins]], which help digest plant material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Unique metabolites protect earthworms against plant polyphenols|url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150804/ncomms8869/full/ncomms8869.html|journal = Nature Communications|date = 2015-08-04|pmc = 4532835|pmid = 26241769|pages = 7869|volume = 6|doi = 10.1038/ncomms8869|language = en|first = Manuel|last = Liebeke|first2 = Nicole|last2 = Strittmatter|first3 = Sarah|last3 = Fearn|first4 = A.

The intestine has its own pair of muscle layers like the body, but in reverse order—an inner circular layer within an outer longitudinal layer.{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|pp=13–15}}

=== Circulatory system ===

The earthworm has a dual circulatory system in which both the coelomic fluid and a closed circulatory system carry the food, waste, and respiratory gases. The closed circulatory system has five main blood vessels: the dorsal (top) vessel, which runs above the digestive tract; the ventral (bottom) vessel, which runs below the digestive tract; the subneural vessel, which runs below the ventral nerve cord; and two lateroneural vessels on either side of the nerve cord.{{sfn|Sims|Gerard|1985|p=10}} The dorsal vessel moves the blood forward, while the other four longitudinal vessels carry the blood rearward. In segments seven through eleven, a pair of aortic arches rings the coelom and acts as hearts, pumping the blood to the ventral vessel that acts as the aorta. The blood consists of ameboid cells and hemoglobin dissolved in the plasma. The second circulatory system derives from the cells of the digestive system that line the coelom. As the digestive cells become full, they release non-living cells of fat into the fluid-filled coelom, where they float freely but can pass through the walls separating each segment, moving food to other parts and assist in wound healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Cleveland P. Hickman Jr., Larry S. Roberts, Frances M Hickman|title=Integrated Principles of Zoology|year=1984|edition=7th|publisher=Times Mirror/Mosby College Publishing|isbn=978-0-8016-2173-4|pages=344–345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Excretory system ===

The excretory system contains a pair of [[nephridia]] in every segment, except for the first three and the last ones.&lt;ref name=Tutorvista&gt;{{cite web|last=Farabee|first=H.J|title=Excretory System|url=http://www.emc.maricopa.edu/faculty/farabee/biobk/biobookexcret.html|accessdate=29 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730161917/http://www.emc.maricopa.edu/faculty/farabee/BIOBK/BioBookEXCRET.html|archivedate=30 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three types of nephridia are: integumentary, septal, and pharyngeal. The integumentary nephridia lie attached to the inner side of the body wall in all segments except the first two. The septal nephridia are attached to both sides of the septa behind the 15th segment. The pharyngeal nephridia are attached to fourth, fifth and sixth segments.&lt;ref name=Tutorvista /&gt; The waste in the coelom fluid from a forward segment is drawn in by the beating of [[motile cilia|cilia]] of the [[nephrostome]]. From there it is carried through the septum (wall) via a tube which forms a series of loops entwined by blood capillaries that also transfer waste into the tubule of the nephrostome. The excretory wastes are then finally discharged through a pore on the worm's side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Cleveland P. Hickman Jr., Larry S. Roberts, Frances M Hickman|title=Integrated Principles of Zoology|year=1984|edition=7th|publisher=Times Mirror/Mosby College Publishing|isbn=978-0-8016-2173-4|pages=345–346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Respiration ===

Earthworms have no special respiratory organs. Gases are exchanged through the moist skin and capillaries, where the oxygen is picked up by the hemoglobin dissolved in the blood plasma and carbon dioxide is released. Water, as well as salts, can also be moved through the skin by active transport.

== Life and physiology ==
At birth, earthworms emerge small, but fully formed, only lack their sex structures, which develop in about 60 to 90 days. They attain full size in about one year. Scientists predict that the average lifespan under field conditions is four to eight years, while most garden varieties live only one to two years.

=== Reproduction ===
[[File:Mating earthworms.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Earthworm copulation&lt;/center&gt;|right]]
[[File:Earthworm - L. terrestris cocoons.jpg|thumb|Earthworm cocoons from ''L. terrestris''|right]]
[[File:Earthworm egg.jpg|thumb|An earthworm cocoon from ''L. rubellus''|right]]

Several common earthworm species are mostly [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]], meaning that growth and development of [[embryos]] happens without [[fertilization]].

Among lumbricid earthworms, parthenogenesis arose from sexual relatives many times.&lt;ref name="pmid25463017"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Domínguez J, Aira M, Breinholt JW, Stojanovic M, James SW, Pérez-Losada M |title=Underground evolution: New roots for the old tree of lumbricid earthworms |journal=Mol.

Mating occurs on the surface, most often at night. Earthworms are [[hermaphrodites]]; that is, they have both male and female sexual organs. The sexual organs are located in segments 9 to 15. Earthworms have one or two pairs of [[testes]] contained within sacs. The two or four pairs of [[seminal vesicles]] produce, store and release the sperm via the male pores. Ovaries and oviducts in segment 13 release eggs via female pores on segment 14, while sperm is expelled from segment 15. One or more pairs of [[spermatheca]]e are present in segments 9 and 10 (depending on the species) which are internal sacs that receive and store sperm from the other worm during copulation. As a result, segment 15 of one worm exudes sperm into segments 9 and 10 with its storage vesicles of its mate. Some species use external [[spermatophore]]s for sperm transfer.

In ''Hormogaster samnitica'' and ''Hormogaster elisae'' [[transcriptome]] DNA libraries were sequenced and two sex [[pheromone]]s, Attractin and Temptin, were detected in all tissue samples of both [[species]].&lt;ref name="pmid23596327"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Novo M, Riesgo A, Fernández-Guerra A, Giribet G |title=Pheromone evolution, reproductive genes, and comparative transcriptomics in mediterranean earthworms (annelida, oligochaeta, hormogastridae) |journal=Mol.

Outcrossing would provide the benefit of masking the expression of deleterious recessive mutations in progeny.&lt;ref name="pmid3324702"&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Bernstein H, Hopf FA, Michod RE |title=The molecular basis of the evolution of sex |journal=Adv.

[[animal sexual behavior|Copulation]] and [[reproduction]] are separate processes in earthworms. The mating pair overlap front ends [[ventral]]ly and each exchanges sperm with the other.  The [[clitellum]] becomes very reddish to pinkish in color.  Some time after copulation, long after the worms have separated, the clitellum (behind the spermathecae) secretes material which forms a ring around the worm. The worm then backs out of the ring, and as it does so, it injects its own eggs and the other worm's sperm into it. As the worm slips out of the ring, the ends of the cocoon seal to form a vaguely onion-shaped incubator ([[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]]) in which the embryonic worms develop.

=== Locomotion ===
[[File:Close up of earthworm.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Close up of an earthworm in garden soil]]
Earthworms travel underground by the means of waves of muscular contractions which alternately shorten and lengthen the body ([[peristalsis]]). The shortened part is anchored to the surrounding soil by tiny claw-like bristles ([[seta]]e) set along its segmented length. In all the body segments except the first, last and clitellum, there is a ring of S-shaped setae embedded in the epidermal pit of each segment (perichaetine). The whole burrowing process is aided by the secretion of lubricating mucus. Worms can make gurgling noises underground when disturbed as a result of their movement through their lubricated tunnels. Earthworms move through soil by expanding crevices with force; when forces are measured according to body weight, hatchlings can push 500 times their own body weight whereas large adults can push only 10 times their own body weight.&lt;ref name="Quillan 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2000|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=203|issue=Pt 18|pages=2757–2770|author=Quillan, K.J.|title=Ontogenetic scaling of burrowing forces in the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/203/18/2757.full.pdf+html|accessdate=April 4, 2015|pmid=10952876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regeneration ===
Earthworms have the ability to regenerate lost segments, but this ability varies between species and depends on the extent of the damage. Stephenson (1930) devoted a chapter of his monograph to this topic, while G.E. Gates spent 20 years studying regeneration in a variety of species, but “because little interest was shown”, Gates (1972) only published a few of his findings that, nevertheless, show it is theoretically possible to grow two whole worms from a bisected specimen in certain species.
Gates’s reports included:
*''[[Eisenia fetida]]'' (Savigny, 1826) with head regeneration, in an anterior direction, possible at each intersegmental level back to and including 23/24, while tails were regenerated at any levels behind 20/21, i.e., two worms may grow from one.&lt;ref name=biolbull /&gt;
*''Lumbricus terrestris'' [[Linnaeus]], 1758 replacing anterior segments from as far back as 13/14 and 16/17 but tail regeneration was never found.
*''Perionyx excavatus'' Perrier, 1872 readily regenerated lost parts of the body, in an anterior direction from as far back as 17/18, and in a posterior direction as far forward as 20/21.
*''Lampito mauritii'' Kinberg, 1867 with regeneration in anterior direction at all levels back to 25/26 and tail regeneration from 30/31; head regeneration was sometimes believed to be caused by internal amputation resulting from ''[[Sarcophaga]]'' sp. larval infestation.
*''Criodrilus lacuum'' Hoffmeister, 1845 also has prodigious regenerative capacity with ‘head’ regeneration from as far back as 40/41.&lt;ref name=Hoffmeister /&gt;

An unidentified Tasmanian earthworm shown growing a replacement head has been reported.&lt;ref name=secondhead /&gt;

== Taxonomy and distribution ==
Within the world of taxonomy, the stable 'Classical System' of Michaelsen (1900) and Stephenson (1930) was gradually eroded by the controversy over how to classify earthworms, such that Fender and McKey-Fender (1990) went so far as to say, "The family-level classification of the megascolecid earthworms is in chaos."&lt;ref name=soilbio /&gt;  Over the years, many scientists developed their own classification systems for earthworms, which led to confusion, and these systems have been and still continue to be revised and updated.  The classification system used here, developed by Blakemore (2000), is a modern reversion to the Classical System that is historically proven and widely accepted.&lt;ref name=blakemore2006 /&gt;

Categorization of a megadrile earthworm into one of its taxonomic families under suborders Lumbricina and Moniligastrida is based on such features as the makeup of the clitellum, the location and disposition of the sex features (pores, prostatic glands, etc.), number of gizzards, and body shape.&lt;ref name=blakemore2006 /&gt;  Currently, over 6,000 species of terrestrial earthworms are named, as provided in a species name database,&lt;ref name=ewdatabase /&gt; but the number of synonyms is unknown.

The families, with their known distributions or origins:&lt;ref name=blakemore2006 /&gt;
* [[Acanthodrilidae]] – (Gondwanan or Pangaean?)
* Ailoscolecidae – Pyrenees and southeast USA
* [[Almidae]] – tropical equatorial (South America, Africa, Indo-Asia)
* Benhamiinae – Ethiopian, Neotropical (a possible subfamily of Octochaetidae)
* [[Criodrilidae]] – southwestern Palaearctic: Europe, Middle East, Russia and Siberia to Pacific coast; Japan (Biwadrilus); mainly aquatic
* Diplocardiinae/-idae – Gondwanan or Laurasian? (a subfamily of Acanthodrilidae)
* [[Enchytraeidae]] – cosmopolitan but uncommon in tropics (usually classed with Microdriles)
* [[Eudrilidae]] – Tropical Africa south of the Sahara
* Exxidae – Neotropical: Central America and Caribbean
* [[Glossoscolecidae]] – Neotropical: Central and  South America, Caribbean
* Haplotaxidae – cosmopolitan distribution (usually classed with Microdriles)
* Hormogastridae – Mediterranean
* Kynotidae – Malagasian: Madagascar
* [[Lumbricidae]] – Holarctic: North America, Europe, Middle East, Central Asia to Japan
* Lutodrilidae – Louisiana southeast USA
* [[Megascolecidae]] – (Pangaean?)
* Microchaetidae – Terrestrial in Africa especially South African grasslands
* [[Moniligastridae]] – Oriental and Indian subregion
* Ocnerodrilidae – Neotropics, Africa; India
* Octochaetidae – Australasian, Indian, Oriental, Ethiopian, Neotropical
* Octochaetinae – Australasian, Indian, Oriental (subfamily if Benhamiinae is accepted)
* [[Sparganophilidae]] – Nearctic, Neotropical: North and Central America
* Tumakidae – Colombia, South America

=== As an invasive species ===
{{Main|Earthworms as invasive species|Invasive earthworms of North America}}
From a total of around 7,000 species, only about 150 species are widely distributed around the world. These are the peregrine or cosmopolitan earthworms.&lt;ref name=cosmo3 /&gt;

== Ecology ==
[[File:Earthworm - L. terrestris permanent vertical burrow.jpg|thumb|upright|Permanent vertical burrow]]
Earthworms are classified into three main ecophysiological categories: (1) leaf litter- or compost-dwelling worms that are nonburrowing, live at soil-litter interface and eat decomposing organic matter (called Epigeic) e.g. ''Eisenia fetida''; (2) topsoil- or subsoil-dwelling worms that feed (on soil), burrow and cast within soil, creating horizontal burrows in upper 10–30&amp;nbsp;cm of soil (called Endogeics); and (3) worms that construct permanent deep vertical burrows which they use to visit the surface to obtain plant material for food, such as leaves (called Anecic (meaning "reaching up")), e.g. ''Lumbricus terrestris''.&lt;ref name=ucdavis /&gt;

Earthworm populations depend on both physical and chemical properties of the soil, such as temperature, moisture, pH, salts, aeration, and texture, as well as available food, and the ability of the species to reproduce and disperse. One of the most important environmental factors is [[pH]], but earthworms vary in their preferences. Most favor neutral to slightly acidic soils. ''Lumbricus terrestris'' is still present in a pH of 5.4 and ''[[Dendrobaena octaedra]]'' at a pH of 4.3 and some [[Megascolecidae]] are present in extremely acidic humic soils. Soil pH may also influence the numbers of worms that go into [[diapause]]. The more acidic the soil, the sooner worms go into diapause and the longer they remain in diapause at a pH of 6.4.

Earthworms form the base of many [[food chains]]. They are preyed upon by many species of [[bird]]s (e.g. [[starling]]s, [[Thrush (bird)|thrushes]], [[gull]]s, [[crow]]s, [[European robin]]s and [[American robin]]s), snakes, mammals (e.g. [[bear]]s, [[fox]]es, [[hedgehog]]s, [[pig]]s, [[mole (animal)|moles]]) and invertebrates (e.g. [[ground beetle]]s and other [[beetle]]s, [[snail]]s, [[slug]]s). Earthworms have many internal [[parasite]]s, including [[protozoa]], [[platyhelminthes]], and [[nematode]]s; they can be found in the worms' [[blood]], [[seminal vesicles]], [[coelom]], or [[intestine]], or in their [[Silkworm cocoons|cocoons]].

Nitrogenous fertilizers tend to create [[Soil pH|acidic conditions]], which are fatal to the worms, and dead specimens are often found on the surface following the application of substances such as [[DDT]], [[lime sulphur]], and [[lead arsenate]]. In [[Australia]], changes in farming practices such as the application of [[superphosphate]]s on [[pasture]]s and a switch from [[pastoral farming]] to [[Agronomy|arable farming]] had a devastating effect on populations of the giant [[Gippsland earthworm]], leading to their classification as a [[protected species]].

The addition of organic matter, preferably as a surface mulch, on a regular basis will provide earthworms with their food and nutrient requirements, and will create the optimum conditions of temperature and moisture that will stimulate their activity.

Earthworms work as biological "[[piston]]s" forcing air through the tunnels as they move. Thus earthworm activity aerates and mixes the soil, and is conducive to mineralization of nutrients and their uptake by vegetation. Certain species of earthworm come to the surface and graze on the higher concentrations of organic matter present there, mixing it with the mineral soil. Because a high level of organic matter mixing is associated with soil fertility, an abundance of earthworms is generally considered beneficial by farmers and gardeners.&lt;ref name=dpi&gt;NSW Department of Primary Industries, [http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/agriculture/soils/biology/earthworms How earthworms can help your soil]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aggie&gt;Galveston County Master Gardener Association, [http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/galveston/beneficials/beneficial-38_earthworms.htm Beneficials in the garden: #38 Earthworms]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, as long ago as 1881 [[Charles Darwin]] wrote: "It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world, as have these lowly organized creatures."&lt;ref name=darwin /&gt;

[[File:Staphylinus.olens.vs.lumbricus.terrestris.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''[[Devil's coach horse beetle]]'' preying on ''Lumbricus'' sp.]]
Also, while, as the name suggests, the main habitat of earthworms is in soil, they are not restricted to this habitat. The brandling worm ''[[Eisenia fetida]]'' lives in decaying plant matter and manure. ''[[Arctiostrotus vancouverensis]]'' from [[Vancouver Island]] and the [[Olympic Peninsula]] is generally found in decaying conifer logs. ''[[Aporrectodea limicola]]'', ''[[Sparganophilus]]'' spp.,  and several others are found in mud in streams.  Some species are arboreal, some aquatic and some euryhaline (salt-water tolerant) and littoral (living on the sea-shore, e.g. ''[[Pontodrilus litoralis]]''). Even in the soil species, special habitats, such as soils derived from [[serpentine group|serpentine]], have an earthworm fauna of their own.

=== Environmental benefits ===
The major benefits of earthworm activities to soil fertility for agriculture can be summarized as:
* '''Biological''': In many soils, earthworms play a major role in the conversion of large pieces of organic matter into rich [[humus]], thus improving soil fertility. This is achieved by the worm's actions of pulling below the surface deposited organic matter such as leaf fall or manure, either for food or to plug its burrow. Once in the burrow, the worm will shred the leaf and partially digest it and mingle it with the earth. Worm casts (see bottom right) can contain 40 percent more humus than the top 9" (23&amp;nbsp;cm) of soil in which the worm is living.&lt;ref name="brady" /&gt;
[[File:Earthworm faeces.jpg|thumb|[[Faeces]] in form of casts]]
* '''Chemical''': In addition to dead [[organic matter]], the earthworm also ingests any other soil particles that are small enough—including sand grains up to 1/20 of an inch (1.25&amp;nbsp;mm)—into its gizzard, wherein those minute fragments of grit grind everything into a fine paste which is then digested in the intestine. When the worm excretes this in the form of casts, deposited on the surface or deeper in the soil, minerals and plant nutrients are changed to an accessible form for plants to use. Investigations in the United States show that fresh earthworm casts are five times richer in available [[nitrogen]], seven times richer in available [[phosphate]]s, and 11 times richer in available [[potassium]] than the surrounding upper 6&amp;nbsp;inches (150&amp;nbsp;mm) of soil. In conditions where humus is plentiful, the weight of casts produced may be greater than 4.5&amp;nbsp;kg (10&amp;nbsp;lb) per worm per year&lt;!-- subjective , and is in itself an indicator of why it pays the gardener or farmer to keep worm populations high--&gt;.&lt;ref name="brady" /&gt;
* '''Physical''': The earthworm's burrowing creates a multitude of channels through the soil and is of great value in maintaining the [[soil structure]], enabling processes of aeration and drainage. [[Permaculture]] co-founder [[Bill Mollison]] points out that by sliding in their tunnels, earthworms "act as an innumerable army of pistons pumping air in and out of the soils on a 24-hour cycle (more rapidly at night)".&lt;ref name=Mollison /&gt; Thus, the earthworm not only creates passages for air and water to traverse the soil, but also modifies the vital organic component that makes a soil healthy (see [[Bioturbation]]). Earthworms promote the formation of nutrient-rich casts (globules of soil, stable in soil [mucus]) that have high soil aggregation and soil fertility and quality.&lt;ref name="brady" /&gt;

Earthworms accelerate nutrient cycling in the soil-plant system through  fragmentation &amp; mixing of plant debris – physical grinding &amp; chemical digestion.&lt;ref name="brady" /&gt; The earthworm's existence cannot be taken for granted. Dr. [[W. E. Shewell-Cooper]] observed "tremendous numerical differences between adjacent gardens", and worm populations are affected by a host of environmental factors, many of which can be influenced by good management practices on the part of the gardener or farmer.&lt;ref name=cooper /&gt;

Darwin estimated that [[arable land]] contains up to 53,000 worms per acre (13/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), but more recent research from [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] has produced figures suggesting that even poor soil may support 250,000/acre (62/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), whilst rich fertile farmland may have up to 1,750,000/acre (432/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), meaning that the weight of earthworms beneath a farmer's soil could be greater than that of the livestock upon its surface.

The ability to break down organic materials and excrete concentrated nutrients makes the earthworm a functional contributor in restoration projects. In response to ecosystem disturbances, some opencast mining sites have utilized earthworms to prepare soil for the return of native flora. Sites using this method have observed advances in the return of [[ecosystem services]] that previously took much longer to re-establish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The potential of earthworms to restore ecosystem services after opencast mining – A review|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179110000101|journal = Basic and Applied Ecology|date = 2010-05-01|pages = 196–203|volume = 11|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.baae.2009.12.005|first = Stephane|last = Boyer|first2 = Stephen D.|last2 = Wratten}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research from the [[Station d'écologie de Lamto|Station d'écologie Tropicale de Lamto]] asserts that the earthworms positively influence the rate of macroaggregate formation, an important feature for soil structure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Restoration by earthworms (megascolecidae) of the macroaggregate structure of a destructured savanna soil under field conditions|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003807179290155Q|journal = Soil Biology and Biochemistry|date = 1992-12-01|pages = 1587–1594|volume = 24|issue = 12|doi = 10.1016/0038-0717(92)90155-Q|first = Eric|last = Blanchart}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stability of aggregates in response to water was also found to be improved when constructed by earthworms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Economic impact ==
[[File:EarthwormChonita01.JPG|thumb|Earthworms being raised at [[La Chonita Hacienda]] in Mexico]]
Various species of worms are used in [[Compost#Vermicompost|vermiculture]], the practice of feeding organic waste to earthworms to decompose food waste. These are usually ''[[Eisenia fetida]]'' (or its close relative ''[[Eisenia andrei]]'') or the Brandling worm, commonly known as the tiger worm or red wiggler. They are distinct from soil-dwelling earthworms.  In the tropics, the African nightcrawler ''[[Eudrilus eugeniae]]'' and the Indian blue ''[[Perionyx excavatus]]'' are used.

Earthworms are sold all over the world; the market is sizable. According to Doug Collicut, "In 1980, 370 million worms were exported from Canada, with a Canadian export value of $13 million and an American retail value of $54 million."

Earthworms are also sold as food for human consumption. [[Noke (worms)|''Noke'']] is a culinary term used by the [[Māori people|Māori]] of [[New Zealand]], and refers to earthworms which are considered delicacies for their chiefs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19076">'''Enterprise systems engineering''' ('''ESE''') is the discipline that applies [[systems engineering]] to the design of an [[business|enterprise]].&lt;ref name="regdes"&gt;R.E. Giachetti (2010). Design of Enterprise Systems: Theory, Architecture, and Methods, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  As a discipline, it includes a body of knowledge, principles, and   processes tailored to the design of enterprise systems. An enterprise is a complex, socio-technical system that comprises interdependent resources of people, information, and technology that must interact to fulfill a common mission.&lt;ref name="regdes" /&gt;

It accomplishes all of the tasks of "traditional" systems engineering, further informed by an expansive view of the context POET (political, operational, economic, technological) in which the system(s) under consideration are being developed, acquired, modified, maintained, or disposed of.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Enterprise systems engineering may be required when the complexity being faced which breaks down the assumptions upon which textbook systems engineering is based, such as requirements being relatively stable and well understood, a system configuration that can be controlled, and a small, easily discernible set of stakeholders.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Enterprise must produce different kind of analysis on the people, technology, components of the company in order to see the whole picture of the enterprise. As nowadays, enterprise becomes more complex with more problems and people to deal with, it is important to integrated the system in order to reach a higher standard or level for the business.&lt;ref name="Joannou 2007"/&gt;

== Elements ==
There are four important elements in order for enterprise system engineering to work. It includes development through adaption, strategic technical planning, enterprise governance and ESE processes (with different stages).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Enterprise Systems Engineering: Advances in the Theory and Practice|last = |first = |publisher = Boca Raton ; London : CRC Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-1420073294|location = |page = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development through adaptation ===
Development through adaptation is a way to compromise with the problems and obstacles in complex systems. As time goes by, the environment will change and it needs adaptation in order to develop continuously. To develop through adaption, something experiences different stages. For example, the mobile phone has gone through quite a few adaptations in its evolutionary development from the past. When it first released, the size of a mobile phone was enormous, but as they passed through generations of development phone became smaller. The development of mobile data from 1G to 4G made using phones faster and more convenient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G: The evolution of wireless generations|url = http://www.phonearena.com/news/1G-2G-3G-4G-The-evolution-of-wireless-generations_id46952|website = Phone Arena|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; To sum up, this refers to the process of creating diverse and innovative ideas and choices for the enterprise and selecting the one that will be most successful for the next generation.

=== Strategic technical planning ===
{{See also|Strategic technology plan}}
Strategic technical planning (STP) gives the enterprise the picture of their aim and objectives in the future and also an assessment on the process of organization. It brings a balance of assimilation and modernization to the enterprise. It has different components for STP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Oldid|page=Strategic Technology Plan|oldid=676805166|label=Strategic Technology Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is strategic planning? - Definition from WhatIs.com|url = http://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/strategic-planning|website = SearchCIO|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mission statement
* Needs assessment
* Technology descriptions and goal statement
* Hardware and software requirement
* Budget plan
* Human Resources

=== Enterprise governance ===
It is defined as 'The set of responsibilities and practices exercised by the board and executive management with the goal of providing strategic direction, ensuring that objectives are achieved, ascertaining that risks are managed appropriately and verifying that the organisation’s resources are used responsibly.' according to (CIMA Official Terminology, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cimaglobal.com/Documents/ImportedDocuments/cid_enterprise_governance__feb08.pdf.pdf|title = Enterprise Governance|date = June 2007|accessdate = 2015-11-02|website = |publisher = CIMA|last = Lees|first = Gillian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enterprise governance includes two aspects which are corporate governance (conformance) and business governance (performance). It is essential to understand the company and to know what must be done in order to succeed. It allows us to make the right decision on the choice of CEO and executives for the company, and also to identify the risks of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cimaglobal.com/Documents/ImportedDocuments/tech_dispap_enterprise_governance_2004.pdf|title = Enterprise Governance – A CIMA discussion paper|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-02|website = |publisher = CIMA|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Processes ==
There are four different steps in the Enterprise system engineering process. It includes technology planning (TP), capabilities-based engineering analysis (CBEA), enterprise architecture (EA) and enterprise analysis and assessment (EA&amp;A).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1109/SYSTEMS.2007.374650 |chapter=Findings of Case Studies in Enterprise Systems Engineering |title=2007 1st Annual IEEE Systems Conference |pages=1–6 |year=2007 |last1=Crider |first1=Kimberly A. |last2=Derosa |first2=Joseph K. |isbn=1-4244-1040-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joannou 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/mc.2007.167 |title=Enterprise, Systems, and Software Engineering--The Need for Integration |journal=Computer |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=103–5 |year=2007 |last1=Joannou |first1=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology planning ===
It is a step that searching and looking for key technologies for the enterprise. The aim of this step is to determine and associate all the innovative ideas and choose the technology that are useful for the enterprise to develop in a sustainable way.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==== Technology needs ====
We have to identify and look for the trend of the technology to decide what technology the company needs. It is important to understand what each of the technology can be achieved and will the characteristic of the technology fits in the company well. There are loads of technology-based decision need to be taken by the company such as deciding which computers to use, which software is suitable and useful for the company, how to build up a system to back up all the customer data or essential statistics for the company with high security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = (NetAction)|url = http://www.netaction.org/training/part6.html|website = www.netaction.org|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capabilities-based engineering analysis ===
It is an analysis method that focus on the essential elements that whole enterprise needs. It is a scheme that target the innovation and evolution of the capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.necsi.edu/events/iccs6/papers/edf44ffdca28da54ce6f97271c81.pdf|title = Capabilities-Based Engineering  Analysis (CBEA)|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-02|website = |publisher = The MITRE Corporation|last = Webb|first = Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a set of essential steps for the analysis. The activities are dependent and it is conducted iteratively.

==== Purpose formulation ====
* Assess Stakeholders Interest – To understand what the stakeholders want and like
* Specify Outcome Spaces – To find solutions for several conditions and the goal for the operations
* Frame [[Capability (systems engineering)|Capability]] Portfolios - To collect all the fundamental elements

==== Exploratory analysis ====
* Assess Performance and Cost – To identify the performance and cost in different conditions and find solutions to improve
* Explore concepts – To search for new concepts and transform advanced capabilities
* Determine the need for more variety – To examine the risks and chances and decide whether new ways are needed

==== Evolutionary planning ====
* Assess Enterprise Impacts – To investigate the effects on the enterprise in technical and [[Capability (systems engineering)|capability]] aspects
* Examine Evolution Strategies – To explore and construct more strategies and evolution route
* Develop Capability Road map – Road map is a plan for the capability area which includes analysis and decision making which is a tool for assessment and development for the enterprise

=== Enterprise architecture ===
[[File:Enterprise Architecture Domain Reference Architecture.JPG|thumb|300x300px|The prospective of Enterprise Architecture]]
It is a model that illustrates the vision, network and framework of an organization. There are four aspects according to Microsoft's Michael Platt which are the prospective of business, application, information and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is enterprise architecture (EA)? - Definition from WhatIs.com|url = http://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/enterprise-architecture|website = SearchCIO|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagram beside shows that structure of the Enterprise Architecture. The benefits of this step are improvement of the decision making for enterprise, increases the efficiency on the IT aspects and also minimize the loss of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Enterprise Architecture {{!}} Centric|url = http://centricconsulting.com/technology-solutions/it-strategy/enterprise-architecture/|website = Centric Consulting|accessdate = 2015-11-02|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Business – The strategies and process by the operation of business
* Application – Interaction and communication along with the process used in the company
* Information – The logical data and statistics that the organization required to run properly and actively
* Technology – The software and hardware and different operation systems that used in the company
All the elements are dependent and rely on each other in order to build the infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DTS Enterprise Architecture|url = http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/dts/architecture/index.html|website = www.montgomerycountymd.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enterprise analysis and assessment ===
Enterprise analysis and assessment aim to find out if the enterprise is going to the right direction and help to do the correct decisions for the organization. It is strong advise to link with enterprise opportunity and risk assessment. There are also qualities that are required for this step such as aware of the suitable and capable technologies, to know and understand about C2 (Command and Control) issues and also the background picture of Modeling and simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.necsi.edu/events/iccs6/papers/a95cd8d8b7238a89aed673ea78de.pdf|title = Enterprise Analysis and Assessment  of Complex Military Command and  Control Environments|date = 2006|accessdate = 2015-11-03|website = |publisher = The MITRE Corporation|last = Roberts|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various activities and actions for this event.
# Multi-scale analysis
# Early and continuous war fighter operational assessment
# Lightweight, portable M&amp;S-based C2 capability representations
# Developmental software versions available for assessment
# Minimal infrastructure
# Flexible modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), operator-in-the-loop (OITL), and hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) capabilities
# In-line, continuous performance monitoring and selective forensics.

== Traditional systems engineering (TSE) ==
TSE refers to traditional systems engineering, which is a term to be defined as an engineering sub-system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Model-oriented systems engineering science : a unifying framework for traditional and complex systems|last = Hybertson|first = Duane|publisher = Boca Raton ; London : CRC Press|year = 2009|isbn = 9781420072518|location = |pages = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/pdf/05_1483.pdf|title = Enterprise Systems Engineering Theory and Practice  Volume 2:  Systems Thinking for the Enterprise:  New and Emerging Perspectives|date = November 2005|accessdate = 2015-11-03|website = |publisher = The MITRE Corporation|last = Rebovich|first = George}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TSE ===
* TSE is composed and constructed by external designer
* It is a stable system which it won't change automatically
* Operation and development are independent with each other
* Most of the components exclude people which therefore people do not play an important role in it
* There are massive machines which have expected conduct
There are differences between TSE and ESE. There are survey results comparing both of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.necsi.edu/events/iccs6/papers/61396b8e80744893d87e811e19b8.pdf|title = On the Pursuit of Enterprise  Systems Engineering Ideas|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-03|website = |publisher = The MITRE Corporation|last = White|first = Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey result shown that TSE and ESE is complementary and interdependent with each other which ESE has a higher rating while TSE could also be a hidden element for ESE. So the combination of TSE and ESE will be ideal for an enterprise in this generation.

== Applications ==
There are two types of ESE application: Information Enterprise Systems Engineering and Social Enterprise Systems Engineering.

=== Information Enterprise Systems Engineering (IESE) ===
It is a system that builds up to meet the requirements and expectations of different stakeholders in the organization. There must be an input device to collect the information and output device to satisfy the information needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Enterprise Information Systems Engineering: The MERODE Approach|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QvuSBAAAQBAJ|publisher = Springer|date = 2014-09-20|isbn = 9783319101453|first = Monique|last = Snoeck|page = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three different aspects for the framework of IESE
# Functional View
# Topology View
# Physical View
Also, there are different rules for the IESE model.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolaidou, M. and Alexopoulou, N. (2007). ''Enterprise Information System Engineering: A Model-based Approach  based on the Zachman Framework''. 1st ed. [pdf] Department of Informatics &amp; Telecommunications, University of Athens, Athens, Greece: arokopio University of Athens, Athens, Greece, pp.1-10. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/hicss/2008/3075/00/30750399.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 3 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Interchangeable point of view
* Detailed views and well displayed. Showing the specific method, solution and techniques
* Consistent views
* Supported viewpoints

=== Social Enterprise System Engineering ===
This is a framework that involves planning, analyzing, mapping and drawing a network of the process for enterprises and stakeholders. Moreover, it creates social value for entrepreneurship and explores and focuses on the social and societal issues. It forms a connection between social enterprise and system engineering. There is a Social Enterprise Systems Engineering V-model, in which two or more social elements are established based on the system engineering framework—for example, more social interface analysis that reviews stakeholders' requirements, and more activities and interactions between stakeholders to exchange opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.procs.2015.03.067 |title=Social Enterprise Systems Engineering |journal=Procedia Computer Science |volume=44 |pages=135–46 |year=2015 |last1=Mason |first1=James }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opportunity and risk management ==
There are opportunities and risks in ESE and they have to be aggressive in seeking opportunities and also finding ways to avoid or minimize the risks. Opportunity is a trigger element that may lead to the accomplishment of objectives. Risk is a potential occurrence and will affect the performance of the entire system.&lt;ref&gt;White, B. (2006). ''Enterprise Opportunity and Risk''. 1st ed. [pdf] 202 Burlington Road  Bedford, MA: INCOSE, pp.3-6. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/pdf/05_1262.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 3 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several reasons for the importance of risk management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Advanced Risk Analysis in Engineering Enterprise Systems|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1FXRBQAAQBAJ|publisher = CRC Press|date = 2012-10-08|isbn = 9781439826157|first = Cesar Ariel|last = Pinto|first2 = Paul R.|last2 = Garvey|pages = 6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# To identify the risks before head which can prepare actions to prevent or minimize the risks
# Since risks can cost the enterprise, determining the risk events can reduce the amount of loss
# Help to know how to allocate the human or technology resources in order avoid the most critical risks
There are few steps in Enterprise risk and opportunity Management Process
* Prepare the risk and opportunity plan – Select team and representatives
* Identify Risks – Complete risks statements for each risk
* Identify Opportunities – People that work at tactical level and manager must understand the opportunities in order to take a further action
* Evaluate the Enterprise Risks and Opportunities – To decide which is more critical and vital
* Develop the plan – Develop after identification and evaluation with different strategies

'''Expected progeny differences''' (EPD) are an evaluation of an [[animal]]’s genetic worth as a parent. They are based on [[animal model]]s which combine all information known about an individual and its relatives to create a [[DNA profiling|genetic profile]] of the animal’s merits. These profiles are then compared only to other individuals of the same breed.

==Types of EPDs==
An example of a set of EPDs looks like the following [[chart]]. Each set of letters stands for a specific measurement with an accuracy reading and percent rank below it. Each EPD is compared to the [[breed]] [[average]] of a given year. The number given by the EPD is the amount above or below this given average.

===Growth EPDs===
Growth EPDs measure the amount of weight a given offspring will gain due to the parent’s [[genetics]].

[[Birth#Cattle|Calving]] ease predicts the level of difficulty first time [[:wikt:heifer|heifer]]s will have during birth. These are determined by the percentage of [[unassisted birth]]s for that particular animal.&lt;ref name="Greiner"&gt;Understanding Expected Progeny Differences (EPDs). Scott P. Greiner, Extension Animal Scientist, Virginia Tech.http://pubs.ext.vt.edu/400/400-804/400-804.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Birth weight]] measures how much above or below the breed’s average an [[offspring]] will gain due to the parent. It does not necessarily predict the exact weight of all offspring, but instead gives a general prediction of how much extra or less weight an offspring will weigh compared to if it had been sired by another bull. High birth weight is the biggest cause of difficulty in calving, so having a [[bull]] with a low birth weight EPD is high beneficial.&lt;ref name="Greiner"/&gt;

[[Weaning]] and [[wikt:yearling|yearling]] weight measure the amount of weight an offspring has gained by the time it is weaned and at the one year mark. Typically the weaning weight is measured at the 205-day mark and the yearling weight is taken at the 365-day mark. Typically a larger number is favored for both of these traits.&lt;ref name="Rumph"&gt;{{cite journal|  authors =Janice M. Rumph| title=Interpretation and Use of Expected Progeny Differences (EPD)|journal= Pfzer Animal Genetics|url= http://www.ansci.cornell.edu/nbcec/producers/sire_selection/chapter9.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milk EPDs give an estimate for the maternal portion of the weaning weight that determined by [[milk production]] of the [[Mother|dam]]. It is measured in pounds of weaning weight of a bull’s grandprogeny due to the milk production of the bull’s daughters.&lt;ref name="Rumph"/&gt;

===Reproductive EPDs===
[[Scrotum|Scrotal]] circumference is an indicator of a bull’s [[fertility]]. A larger circumference is preferred and is an indicator for his sons to have a larger scrotal circumference and his daughters to reach [[puberty]] sooner and therefore have [[Calf|calves]] sooner.&lt;ref name="Rumph"/&gt;

[[Gestation]] length is an indicator of the probability of [[dystocia]]. The longer a calf is [[in utero]] the larger it will be at birth and the greater the chance of it having dystocia. It also gives the cow a larger postpartum interval between [[Pregnancy|pregnancies]]. A shorter gestation length is usually preferred because of this.&lt;ref name="Rumph"/&gt;

Stayability is an indicator EPD of [[longevity]] of a bull’s daughter in a [[cow]] herd. The higher the EPD value the greater chance a cow will stay in a herd over six years and continue producing quality offspring.&lt;ref name="Rumph"/&gt;

===Carcass EPDs===
[[Carcass weight]] predicts what an animal’s total [[retail]] product will be compared to other animals of that breed. It does not however predict percent retail value, or the actual amount of sellable [[meat]] that can be produced from the carcass.&lt;ref name="Barham"&gt;Understanding and using Expected Progeny Differences (EPDs). Brett Barham, PhD. Extension Livestock Specialist at University of Arkansas. http://www.uaex.edu/Other_Areas/publications/PDF/FSA-3068.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fat]] thickness determined the expected external and seam fat the animal will contain. These two factors contribute to the greatest waste in an animal and best way to reduce [[economic loss]]. Fat thickness EPDs can help producers reduce this loss, by using animals with mid range EPDs, so as not to have too little or too much fat.&lt;ref name="Barham"/&gt;

[[Marbled meat|Marbling]] EPDs are also important in the [[beef]] industry for predicting palatability in a beef carcass. They show the estimated [[USDA]] Quality grading System and marbling score an animal would receive if it were [[Animal slaughter|slaughtered]]. This EDP is different in that it is measured in units of marbling score, and not in weight gained by an animal. Higher values indicate the presence of genes that will produce more [[intramuscular fat]].&lt;ref name="Barham"/&gt;

==Use and accuracy==
EPDs are used in both [[scientific research]] and in typical [[farm]] usage. Through mathematical equations and computing power EPDs can be generated for use in both situations. Through EPDs certain [[phenotype]]s can be chosen for over others. Use of EPSs and [[DNA marker]]s can help when choosing certain traits over others. By using certain EPDs of an animal one can rapidly improve genetics of a herd, especially for highly heritable traits such as marbling. In addition, by using a combination of EPDs and DNA markers, EPDs can be made more accurate.  When new DNA markers are used, they can help adjust the EPD according to the [[genotype]] and therefore produce a more accurate measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=C.B. Rincker| title= Relationship among GeneSTAR marbling marker, intramuscular fat deposition, and expected progeny differences in early weaned Simmental steers | journal= Journal of Animal Science| issue=84 |year=2006| pages=686–693| PMID=16478961|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To determine how accurate EPDs are for an individual, samples of all of a bull’s offspring are looked at and compared to what their expected outcome should have been. The EPDs can then be changed based on the values that are gathered. The higher the accuracy rate, the closer most of the [[offspring|progeny]] will be to the EPD values listed. Accuracy is not an indicator of beneficial EPDs, but rather shows how close the EPD is to the true genetic potential of the animal.&lt;ref name="Rumph"/&gt; The closer an accuracy value is to 1, the more accurate the EPDs can be thought to be. Other factors can affect the progeny as well, such as non genetic effects including feed, weather, environment, as well as [[Mendelian randomization|random Mendelian sampling]].

In addition to the EPD and accuracy shown in a chart, often the percent rank is also given. This shows what percentile the animal ranks for the given EPD. The higher the [[percentile]], the better the EPD is for that characteristic. The better the EPDs for a given bull, the higher chance its progeny will have a given characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;Drennan, M. J., and M. McGee.

The '''Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict''' is the first [[international treaty]] that focuses exclusively on the protection of [[cultural property]] in armed conflict. It was signed at [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] on 14 May 1954 and entered into force on 7 August 1956. As of September 2018, it has been ratified by 133 states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13637&amp;language=E&amp;order=alpha&lt;/ref&gt;

The provisions of the 1954 Convention were supplemented and clarified by two protocols concluded in 1954 and 1999. All three agreements are part of International Humanitarian Law, which, in the form of further agreements, primarily includes provisions defining the permissible means and methods of warfare and aiming at the widest possible protection of persons not involved in the fighting. In contrast to these parts of International Humanitarian Law, the agreements on the protection of cultural property were drawn up under the auspices of the United Nations (UN); the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is primarily responsible for the dissemination and monitoring of compliance. In addition to rules designed to ensure the protection and respect of cultural property during an armed conflict, these agreements also provide for security measures to be implemented in times of peace. As of June 2018, 132 states are party to the Hague Convention of 1954, 109 and 77 states respectively have acceded to the Protocols of 1954 and 1999. Blue Shield International, based in The Hague, is active in the field of international coordination with regard to military and civil structures for the protection of cultural assets.

The guiding principles of the Convention and the motivation for its conclusion, dissemination and respect are summarised in the preamble, which states, among other things,

"... that any damage to cultural property, irrespective of the people it belongs to, is a damage to the cultural heritage    of all humanity, because every people contributes to the world's culture..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/convention-and-protocols/1954-hague-convention/text/|title=Text  {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2018, 133 states are party to the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html#STATE_PARTIES&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are 109 States Parties to the First Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=15391&amp;language=E&amp;order=alpha&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Protocol has 77 States Parties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=15207&amp;language=E&amp;order=alpha&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural property==
For the purposes of the present Convention, the term 'cultural property' shall cover, irrespective of origin or ownership:

(a) movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people, such as monuments of architecture, art or history, whether religious or secular; archaeological sites; groups of buildings which, as a whole, are of historical or artistic interest; works of art; manuscripts, books and other objects of artistic, historical or archaeological interest; as well as scientific collections and important collections of books or archives or of reproductions of the property defined above;

(b) buildings whose main and effective purpose is to preserve or exhibit the movable cultural property defined in sub-paragraph (a) such as museums, large libraries and depositories of archives, and refuges intended to shelter, in the event of armed conflict, the movable cultural property defined in sub-paragraph (a);

(c) centers containing a large amount of cultural property as defined in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), to be known as 'centers containing monuments'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cultural property]] is the manifestation and expression of the cultural heritage of a group of people or a society. It is an expression of the ways of living developed by a community and passed on from generation to generation, including the customs of a people, their practices, places, objects, artistic endeavours and values. The protection of cultural property during times of armed conflict or occupation is of great importance, because such property reflects the life, history and identity of communities; its preservation helps to rebuild communities, re-establish identities, and link people's past with their present and future.

== History ==
The [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] preceded the Hague Convention of 1954.&lt;ref name="Nijhoff"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The laws of armed conflicts : a collection of conventions, resolutions, and other documents |date=1988 |publisher=Nijhoff |last=Schindler |first=Dietrich |last2=Toman |first2=Jiří |isbn=9024733065 |edition=3rd |location=Dordrecht |oclc=13270517}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multilateral agreement of 1899 and the slightly amended later version of 1907 contained in Article 27 the commandment for the attacking party to spare historical monuments, educational institutions and institutions of religious, not-for-profit, artistic or scientific significance as far as possible during sieges and bombardments. The party under attacked is called upon to ark appropriate buildings. Article 56 also contained a general ban on the confiscation, destruction or damage of such facilities. However, during the [[First World War]], acceptance of these first Hague Conventions was severely restricted by the so-called all-participation clause. It stated that, in the event of war or armed conflict, this Agreement should apply only if all States involved in that conflict are parties to the Convention.

The Russian lawyer, painter and writer [[Nicholas Roerich]], who witnessed the destruction of cultural assets in Russia during the First World War and the [[October Revolution]], initiated the development of an independent treaty at the beginning of the 1930s to protect cultural assets during armed conflicts. Ten years later, just before the beginning of the First World War, he had also addressed his idea to the Russian Tsar Nicholas II. On his initiative, Georges Chklaver of the Institute for Higher International Studies at the University of Paris drew up a corresponding draft in 1929. This proposal was subsequently discussed by the International Museum Office of the [[League of Nations]] and at private conferences in Bruges in 1931 and 1932 and in Washington, D.C. in 1933. The seventh international conference of American states, which took place in Buenos Aires in 1933, recommended the adoption of the draft. The Board of the Pan-American Union subsequently presented a treaty "on the protection of artistic and scientific institutions and historical monuments", which was signed on 15 April 1935 in the White House by 21 states in North, Central and South America.&lt;ref name="Nijhoff"/&gt; Ten of the signatory states also became parties by ratification, the first of which was the United States on 13 July 1935 and the last of which was Colombia on 20 February 1937. The agreement, also known as the [[Roerich Pact]] after its initiator, entered into force on 26 August 1935.

The Roerich Pact contained eight articles and several significant innovations compared with the general provisions of Articles 27 and 56 of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. On the one hand, the treaty established the status of neutrality for historical monuments, museums, scientific and artistic institutions as well as educational and cultural institutions. This legal position, comparable to the neutrality of medical personnel and comparable institutions during a war, resulted in respect for these goods by all parties involved in a conflict and thus their protection. The Parties should send lists of monuments and sites for which they claimed protection under the Treaty to the Pan-American Union, which should forward them to all States Parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Roerich Pact|date=2018-05-08|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roerich_Pact&amp;oldid=840203974|encyclopedia=Wikipedia|language=en|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Banner of Peace from the Roerich Pact.svg|thumb|120x120px|The Banner of Peace- The Emblem of Protection of the Roerich Pact]]
In addition, the Treaty defined a protection mark for the marking of cultural objects, consisting of three red dots in a red circle on a white background. Nicholas Roerich, who designed it with early symbolism in mind, described the significance of the three points as a symbol of art, science and religion as the three most important cultural activities of humanity, with the circle as the element that linked these three aspects in the past, present and future. The symbol was also called the "Banner of Peace", the movement based on the Roerich Pact under the name Pax Cultura in analogy to the [[Geneva Conventions]] as the "Red Cross of Culture".

However, the acceptance of the Roerich Pact was limited to the United States and the countries of Central and South America. Not a single country in Europe and Asia, the geopolitical focus of the Second World War that began a few years later, signed or ratified the treaty. Even though it remains valid in relations between the parties and the Organization of American States (OAS) and continues to act as a depositary in succession to the Pan-American Union, the Roerich Pact remained without significant practical relevance. As the USA is not party to the 1999 Second Protocol of the Hague Convention, the Roerich Pact is therefore still of importance as a contractual obligation in the area of cultural property protection. Nevertheless, with the establishment of a protective label and the administration of lists of cultural assets worthy of protection by a central international institution, this treaty introduced two important far-reaching principles in the area of the protection of cultural assets in armed conflicts that remain important today.

Only four years after the Roerich Pact was signed, the government of the Netherlands presented a draft for a new convention, in the drafting of which the International Museum Office of the League of Nations was also significantly involved. However, the start of the [[Second World War]] in the same year prevented all further steps to develop and implement this proposal. After the end of the war, in 1948 the Netherlands again submitted a proposal to UNESCO, which had been founded three years earlier. In 1951, the General Conference of UNESCO decided to set up a committee of governmental experts to draft a new convention. A year later, this committee submitted a draft to the General Conference, which forwarded it to the national governments for further discussion. From 21 April to 14 May 1954, an international conference was held in The Hague with the participation of 56 states, which drew up a final version and adopted it as the "Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict".&lt;ref name="Nijhoff"/&gt; The agreement entered into force on 7 August 1956. After the 1948 [[Genocide Convention]] on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, this was the second important agreement in the field of international humanitarian law to which the United Nations played a major role in its creation and implementation.

== The Hague Convention==
The Hague Convention outlines various prohibitions and obligations which States Parties are expected to observe, both in peacetime and in times of conflict.

Broadly, the Hague Convention requires that States Parties adopt protection measures during peacetime for the safeguarding of cultural property. Such measures include the preparation of inventories, preparation for the removal of movable cultural property and the designation of competent authorities responsible for the safeguarding of cultural property.

States Parties undertake to respect cultural property, not only located within their own territory, but also within the territory of other States Parties, during times of conflict and occupation. In doing so, they agree to refrain from using cultural property and its immediate surroundings for purposes likely to expose it to destruction or damage in the event of armed conflict. States Parties also agree to refrain from any act of hostility directed against such property.

The Convention also requires the establishment of special units within national military forces, to be charged with responsibility for the protection of cultural property. Furthermore, States Parties are required to implement criminal sanctions for breaches of the Convention, and to undertake promotion of the Convention to the general public, cultural heritage professionals, the military and law-enforcement agencies.

An example of the successful implementation of the Hague Convention was the Gulf War, in which many members of the coalition forces (who were either party to the Convention or who, in the instance of the US, were not party to the Convention) accepted the Convention's rules, most notably by creating a "no-fire target list" of places where cultural property was known to exist.

===Safeguarding cultural property===
The obligation of States Parties to safeguard cultural property in peacetime is outlined in Article 3. It stipulates:

'The High Contracting Parties undertake to prepare in time of peace for the safeguarding of cultural property situated within their own territory against the foreseeable effects of an armed conflict, by taking such measures, as they consider appropriate.'&lt;ref name="portal.unesco.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html#STATE_PARTIES|title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respect for cultural property===
The Hague Convention sets out a minimum level of respect which all States Parties must observe, both in relation to their own national heritage as well as the heritage of other States Parties. States are obliged not to attack cultural property, nor to remove or misappropriate movable property from its territory of origin. Only exceptional cases of 'military necessity' will excuse derogation from this obligation. However, a State Party is not entitled to ignore the Convention's rules by reason of another Party's failure to implement safeguarding measures alone.

This is set out in Article 4 of the Hague Convention:

'Article 4:

(1) The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect cultural property situated within their own territory as well as within the territory of other High Contracting Parties by refraining from any use of the property and its immediate surroundings or of the appliances in use for its protection for purposes which are likely to expose it to destruction or damage in the event of armed conflict; and by refraining from any act of hostility directed against such property.

(2) The obligations mentioned in paragraph I of the present Article may be waived only in cases where military necessity imperatively requires such a waiver.

(3) The High Contracting Parties further undertake to prohibit, prevent and, if necessary, put a stop to any form of theft, pillage or misappropriation of, and any acts of vandalism directed against, cultural property. They shall, refrain from requisitioning movable cultural property situated in the territory of another High Contracting Party.

(4) They shall refrain from any act directed by way of reprisals against cultural property.

(5) No High Contracting Party may evade the obligations incumbent upon it under the present Article, in respect of another High Contracting Party, by reason of the fact that the latter has not applied the measures of safeguard referred to in Article 3.'&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupation===
The rules set out in the Hague Convention also apply to States who are Occupying Powers of territory during conflict or otherwise. The Convention obliges Occupying Powers to respect the cultural property of the occupied territory, and to support local national authorities in its preservation and repair when necessary. This obligation is articulated in Article 5:

'Article 5:

(1) Any High Contracting Party in occupation of the whole or part of the territory of another High Contracting Party shall as far as possible support the competent national authorities of the occupied country in safeguarding and preserving its cultural property.

(2) Should it prove necessary to take measures to preserve cultural property situated in occupied territory and damaged by military operations, and should the competent national authorities be unable to take such measures, the Occupying Power shall, as far as possible, and in close co-operation with such authorities, take the most necessary measures of preservation.

(3) Any High Contracting Party whose government is considered their legitimate government by members of a resistance movement, shall, if possible, draw their attention to the obligation to comply with those provisions of the Conventions dealing with respect for cultural property.'&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Special protection ===
The Hague Convention establishes a 'special protection' regime, which obliges States Parties to ensure the immunity of cultural property under special protection from acts of hostility (Articles 8 and 9).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Under Article 8, this protection may be granted to one of three categories of cultural property: (1) refuges intended to shelter movable cultural property in the event of armed conflict; (2) centers containing monuments; and (3) other immovable cultural property of very great importance. To receive special protection, cultural property must also be located an adequate distance from an industrial center or location which would render it vulnerable to attack, and must not be used for military purposes.

== First Protocol to the Hague Convention ==
The First Protocol was adopted at the same time as the Hague Convention, on 14 May 1954. It specifically applies to movable cultural property only, and prohibits the export of movable property from occupied territory and also requires its return to its original territory at the conclusion of hostilities (Article 1).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15391&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html#STATE_PARTIES|title=Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed conflict|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; States Parties under the obligation to prevent the export of such property may be required to pay an indemnity to States whose property was removed during hostilities.

==Second Protocol to the Hague Convention==
{{anchor|Second Protocol to the Hague Convention}}
Criminal acts committed against cultural property in the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s highlighted the deficiencies in the implementation of the Hague Convention and its First Protocol. As a result of the 'Boylan review' (a review of the Convention led by Professor Patrick Boylan),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0010/001001/100159eo.pdf|title=Review of the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in Armed Conflict|last=Boylan|first=Patrick J.|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Second Protocol to the Hague Convention was adopted at a Diplomatic Conference held at The Hague in March 1999. The Second Protocol seeks complement and expand upon the provisions of the Hague Convention, by including developments in international humanitarian law and cultural property protection which had emerged since 1954. It builds on the provisions contained in the Convention relating to the safeguarding of and respect for cultural property, as well as the conduct of hostilities; thereby providing greater protection for cultural property than that conferred by the Hague Convention and its First Protocol.

===Enhanced protection===
[[File:Azerbaijan Gobustan site - EP sign.jpg|thumb|The enhanced protection emblem displayed at the Gobustan Archaeological site in Azerbaijan.]]
One of the most important features of the Second Protocol is the 'enhanced protection' regime it establishes. This new category of cultural property is outlined in Chapter Three of the Second Protocol. Enhanced protection status means that the relevant cultural property must remain immune from military attack, once it is inscribed on the List of Cultural Property Under Enhanced Protection.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/protection/protection-of-cultural-heritage-in-armed-conflict/enhanced-protection/|title=Enhanced Protection {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the 1954 Hague Convention requires States not to make any cultural property the object of attack except for cases of 'military necessity', the Second Protocol stipulates that cultural property under enhanced protection must not be made a military target, even if it has (by its use) become a 'military objective'. An attack against cultural property which enjoys enhanced protection status is only excusable if such an attack is the 'only feasible means of terminating the use of property [in that way]' (Article 13).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15207&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Second Protocol to the Hague Convention of 1954 for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be granted enhanced protection, the cultural property in question must satisfy the three criteria stipulated in Article 10 of the Second Protocol. The three conditions are:

(a) it  is cultural heritage of the greatest importance for humanity;

(b) it is protected by adequate domestic legal and administrative measures recognising its exceptional cultural and historic value and ensuring the highest level of protection; and

(c) it is not used for military purposes or to shield military sites and a declaration has been made by the Party which has control over the cultural property, confirming that it will not be so used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15207&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Second Protocol to the Hague Convention of 1954 for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently there are 13 cultural properties from 8 States Parties inscribed on the Enhanced Protection List. These include sites in Azerbaijan, Belgium, Cambodia, Cyprus, Georgia, Italy, Lithuania, and Mali.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt;

===The Committee for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict===
Article 24 of the Second Protocol establishes a 12-member Committee for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. Its members are elected for a term of four years, and an equitable geographic representation is taken into account at the election of its members. The Committee meets once a year in ordinary session, and in extraordinary sessions if and when it deems necessary.

The Committee is responsible for the granting, suspension and cancellation of enhanced protection to cultural properties nominated by States Parties. It also receives and considers requests for international assistance which are submitted by States, as well as determining the use of the Fund for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. Under Article 27 of the Second Protocol, the Committee also has a mandate to develop Guidelines for the implementation of the Second Protocol.

===The Fund for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict===
Article 29 of the Second Protocol establishes the Fund for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. Its purpose is to provide financial or other assistance for 'preparatory or other measures to be taken in peacetime'. It also provides financial or other assistance in relation to 'emergency, provisional or other measures to protect cultural property during periods of armed conflict', or for recovery at the end of hostilities. The Fund consists of voluntary contributions from States Parties to the Second Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/protection/protection-of-cultural-heritage-in-armed-conflict/fund/|title=Fund {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the sums of US $50,000 and US $40,000 were provided to Libya and Mali respectively from the Fund, in response to their requests for assistance in the installation of emergency and safeguarding measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/protection/protection-of-cultural-heritage-in-armed-conflict/international-assistance/|title=International Assistance {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanctions and individual criminal responsibility===
Chapter Four of the Second Protocol specifies sanctions to be imposed for serious violations against cultural property, and defines the conditions in which individual criminal responsibility should apply. This reflects an increased effort to fight impunity through effective criminal prosecution since the adoption of the Hague Convention in 1954. The Second Protocol defines five 'serious violations' for which it establishes individual criminal responsibility (Article 15):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15207&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Second Protocol to the Hague Convention of 1954 for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# making cultural property under enhanced protection the object of attack; 
# using cultural property under enhanced protection or its immediate surroundings in support of military action; 
# extensive destruction or appropriation of cultural property protected under the Convention and this Protocol; 
# making cultural property protected under the Convention and this Protocol the object of attack; and
# theft, pillage or misappropriation of, or acts of vandalism directed against cultural property protected under the Convention.
States are obligated to adopt appropriate legislation to make these violations criminal offences under their domestic legislation, to stipulate appropriate penalties for these offences, and to establish jurisdiction over these offences (including universal jurisdiction for three of the five serious violations, as set out in Article 16(1)(c)).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/590&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of prosecution for crimes against cultural property is ''The Prosecutor v Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi'' case, handed down by the International Criminal Court on 27 September 2016. Al Mahdi was charged with and pleaded guilty to the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against historic monuments and buildings dedicated to religion, and sentenced to nine years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/mali/al-mahdi/Documents/AlMahdiEng.pdf|title=Case Information Sheet: The Prosecutor v Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi|last=International Criminal Court|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803043957/https://www.icc-cpi.int/mali/al-mahdi/Documents/AlMahdiEng.pdf|archive-date=3 August 2016|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Mahdi was a member of the Ansar Eddine group (a group associated with Al Qaeda), and a co-perpetrator of damaging and destroying nine mausoleums and one mosque in Timbuktu, Mali, in 2012.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Military Manual ===
[[File:Military manual.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Military Manual on the Protection of Cultural Property]]
In 2016 UNESCO, in collaboration with the Sanremo International Institute of Humanitarian Law, published a manual titled 'Protection of Cultural Property: Military Manual'. This manual outlines the rules and obligations contained in the Second Protocol, and provides practical guidance on how these rules should be implemented by military forces around the world. It also contains suggestions as to best military practices in relation to these obligations. It relates only to the international laws governing armed conflict, and does not discuss military assistance that is provided in connection with other circumstances such as natural disasters.

==Destruction of cultural property in World War II==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}

===The Nazis and "degenerate art"===
[[File:Jean Metzinger, 1913, Le Canot, En Canot, Femme au Canot et a l'Ombrelle, Im Boot, approximate dimensions 150 x 116.5 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Metzinger]]'s ''[[En Canot|En Canot (Im Boot)]]'' was one of many works classified as [[degenerate art]] and confiscated by the Nazis.]]The Nazi Party headed by [[Adolf Hitler]] rose to power in Germany in 1933 after the country's crippling defeat, and its socioeconomic distress during the years following [[World War I]]. [[World War II]] was aimed at reclaiming the glory of the once great Germanic state. Cultural property of many European nations and significant ethnic and social groups within them fell victim to Nazi Germany. The Nazi party, through the [[Third Reich]], confiscated close to 20% of all Western European art during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/holocaust/records-and-research/documenting-nazi-plunder-of-european-art.html|title=Documenting Nazi Plunder of European Art|date=2016-08-15|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Nazi party had looted and collected thousands of objects, art works and artefacts from occupied nations, destroyed many, or stored them in secret.

With artists depicting the hardship of the German people after World War I, and further expressing the fear of anti-Semitism and fascism, the Nazi party and Hitler himself soon realised the dangerous power of art, and began to clamp down on artistic production and forcing both artists and the public alike to adhere to a Nazi-approved style.&lt;ref name="Alter-Müri 2004 15–20"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alter-Müri|first=Simone|date=2004|title=Teaching about War and Political Art in the New Millennium|jstor=3194079|journal=Art Education|volume=57|issue=1|pages=15–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inherent within the Nazi's ideology was the idea of supremacy of the [[Aryan race|Aryan Race]] and all that it produced; as such the Nazi campaign's aims were to neutralize non-Germanic cultures and this was done through the destruction of culturally significant art and artefacts. This is illustrated greatest in the Jewish communities throughout Europe; by devising a series of laws that allowed them to justify and regulate the legal confiscation of cultural and personal property. Within Germany the looting of German Jewish cultural property began with the confiscation of non-Germanic artwork in the German state collection. Further, artists that were Jewish and artworks that did not match the Nazi ideology, or posed a threat to it, were stamped as [[degenerate art]]. Degenerate works of art, culminating in the infamous exhibition with the same name, were those whose subject, artist, or art was either Jewish or expressed Anti-Nazi sentiments, and was as such offensive to the Third Reich.&lt;ref name="Alter-Müri 2004 15–20"/&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14597, Berlin, Opernplatz, Bücherverbrennung.jpg|default px|thumbnail|right|[[Nazi book burnings]].]]

Jewish collections were looted the most throughout the war. German Jews were ordered to report their personal assets, which were then privatized by the country. Jewish owned art galleries were forced to sell the works of art they housed. The Nazis concentrated their efforts on ensuring that all art within Germany would be Aryan in nature, speaking to the might of the Germanic state rather than Jewish art which was deemed as a blight on society. In a feat to "purge" German museums and collections, confiscation committees seized approximately 16,000 items within Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198604761.001.0001/acref-9780198604761-e-1002|title=Degenerate art - Oxford Reference|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780198604761.001.0001/acref-9780198604761-e-1002|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining unexploited art was destroyed in massive bonfires. As the war progressed, the Nazi party elite ordered the confiscation of cultural property throughout various European countries.

===Nazi plunder in Eastern Europe===
[[File:Amber Room-1.jpg|thumbnail|Modern Day Amber Room]]
In the [[Soviet Union]], Nazi plunder of cultural significant art is best illustrated in the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich's]] pillage of the [[Catherine Palace]] near [[St Petersburg]] and its famous [[Amber Room]] dating to the early 1700s. In October 1941, the Nazis had occupied the western portion of the Soviet Union, and began removing art treasures to the west. The entirety of the [[Amber Room]] was removed to [[Königsberg]] and reconstructed there. In January 1945, with the Russian army advancing on the city, the Amber Room was ordered to be moved again but its fate is thereafter unclear. A post-war Russian report concluded that 'summarizing all the facts, we can say that the Amber Room was destroyed between 9 and 11 April 1945' during the battle to take the city. However, in the absence of definitive proof, other theories about its fate continue to be entertained to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/a-brief-history-of-the-amber-room-160940121/|title=A Brief History of the Amber Room|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With financial assistance from German donors, Russian craftsmen reconstructed a new Amber Room during the 1990s. The new room was dedicated by Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] and German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] at the 300th anniversary of the city of Saint Petersburg.

==After World War II==
With the conclusion of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and the subsequent defeat of the [[Axis Powers]], the atrocities which the Nazi leadership condoned, leading to the removal of culturally significant items and the destruction of numerous others could not be allowed to occur in future generations. This led the victorious [[Allied forces (World War II)|Allied forces]] to create provisions to ensure safeguards for culturally significant items in times of war. As a result, following the signature of the [[Roerich Pact]] by the American States in 1935, attempts were undertaken to draft a more comprehensive convention for the protection of monuments and works of art in time of war. In 1939, a draft convention, elaborated under the auspices of the International Museums Office, was presented to governments by the Netherlands. Due to the onset of the Second World War the draft convention was shelved with no further steps being taken. With the conclusion of the war, a new proposal was submitted to [[UNESCO]] by the Netherlands in 1948. The General Conference of [[UNESCO]] in 1951 decided to convene a committee of government experts to draft a convention. This committee met in 1952 and thereafter submitted its drafts to the General Conference. The intergovernmental Conference, which drew up and adopted the Convention and the further Acts, took place at The Hague from 21 April to 14 May 1954 where 56 States were represented. Following this international agreement The Hague Convention For the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict would come into force in 1956 in order to be an instrument of non derogation for the states bound by the document to stop the looting and destruction of cultural property.

==Implementation of the Convention==

=== Punishment for infringements ===
The [[Rome Statute]], adopted in July 1998 and entering into force four years later, as the legal basis of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), defines in Article 8(2) deliberate attacks against buildings of a religious, educational, artistic, scientific or non-profit nature and against historical monuments as [[war crimes]] in both international and non-international armed conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl|title=Treaties, States parties, and Commentaries - By topic|website=ihl-databases.icrc.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Criminal Court is thus authorised to prosecute such crimes if such an act was committed either by a national of a Contracting Party or on the territory of a Contracting Party. However, it only exercises its competence if the country concerned is unwilling or unable to ensure effective prosecution itself. Since September 2015, Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi has been charged with the destruction of mausoleums in Timbuktu in the first trial before the ICC over the destruction of cultural assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/PIDS/publications/AlMahdiEng.pdf|title=Situation in the Republic of Mali, The Prosecutor v.

=== Siege of Dubrovnik and the Mostar Bridge ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}
[[File:Aerial view Dubrovnik Old City.jpg|thumbnail|The Old City of Dubrovnik]]
Article 3 of the Statute of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] also contains provisions that allow the prosecution of violations of the fundamental principles of the Hague Convention of 1954. On the basis of this article, for the first time since the conclusion of the Convention, proceedings were brought in an international court for the destruction of cultural property during an armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abtahi|first=Hirad|date=|title=The Protection of Cultural Property in Times of Armed Conflict: The Practice of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia|url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/files/6418-abtahi-hirad-2001-protection-of-cultural-property|journal=Harvard Human Rights Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of its establishment the city of Dubrovnik was under the protection of the [[Byzantine Empire]]; after the Fourth Crusade the city came under the sovereignty of Venice 1205–1358 CE, and by the [[Treaty of Zadar]] in 1358, it became part of the Hungarian-Croatian Kingdom. Following the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the city was annexed by Austria and remained part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the conclusion of the First World War. From 1918 to 1939 Dubrovnik was part of the Zetska Banovina District that established its Croatian connections. From 1945 to 1990 Croatia would become part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. One of the most striking features of the historic city of Dubrovnik, and that which gives its characteristic appearance are its intact medieval fortifications. Its historic city walls run uninterrupted encircling the Old-City. This complex structure of fortification is one of the most complete depictions of medieval construction in the Mediterranean, consisting of a series of forts, bastions, casemates, towers and detached forts. Within the Old City are many medieval churches, cathedrals, and palaces from the Baroque period, encircled by its fortified wall, which would ensure its listed place by [[UNESCO]] as a world heritage site in 1972. The Old Town is not only an architectural and urban ensemble of high quality, but it is also full of museums and libraries, such as the collection of the Ragusan masters in the Dominican Monastery, the Museum of the History of Dubrovnik, the Icon Museum, and the libraries of the Franciscan and Dominican Monasteries. It also houses the archives of [[Ragusa (Croatia)|Ragusa]], which have been kept continuously since the 13th century and are a very important source for Mediterranean history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/95|title=Old City of Dubrovnik|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archives hold materials created by the civil service in the Republic of Ragusa.

The Siege of Dubrovnik was a military engagement fought between the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) and Croatian forces which defended the city of Dubrovnik and its surroundings during the Croatian War of Independence. The Old Town was specifically targeted by the JNA even though it served no military purpose to bomb this town. At the heart of the bombing efforts by the JNA elite was the complete eradication of the memory of the Croatian people and history by erasing their cultural heritage and destroying their cultural property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/strugar/cis/en/cis_strugar_en.pdf|title=ICTY Information Sheet on Dubrovnik Case and Strugar|last=|first=|date=|website=ICTY|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court's convictions, which among other charges were also based on this article, were issued in February 2001 against Dario Kordić,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/kordic_cerkez/4|title=Kordić &amp; Čerkez (IT-95-14/2) {{!}} International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|website=www.icty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a commander of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) during the war in Bosnia, against Miodrag Jokić,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/miodrag_jokic/4|title=Jokić, Miodrag (IT-01-42/1) {{!}} International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|website=www.icty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a senior commander in the navy of the Yugoslav People's Army during the Battle of Dubrovnik in 1991, and against Milan Martić,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/martic/4|title=Martić (IT-95-11) {{!}} International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|website=www.icty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a politician and military leader of the internationally unrecognized Republic of Serbian Krajina. The attacks on the Herzegovinian city of Mostar, which in November 1993 led to the destruction of the Stari most bridge, internationally recognised as an outstanding cultural asset, led to the trial of six defendants before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/prlic/4|title=Prlić et al. (IT-04-74) {{!}} International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|website=www.icty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them is the Croatian General Slobodan Praljak, who is suspected of having ordered the fire on the bridge.

The historic town of [[Mostar]], spanning a deep valley of the Neretva River, developed in the 15th and 16th centuries as an Ottoman frontier town and during the [[Austro-Hungarian]] period in the 19th and 20th centuries. Mostar was mostly known for its old Turkish houses and specifically the [[Old Bridge, Mostar|Old Bridge]]; the Stari Mostar, after which it is named. In the 1990s conflict with the former Yugoslavia, however, most of the historic town and the Old Bridge were destroyed purposely by Croatian Army and their allies. This type of destruction was in step with that of the Old Town of Dubrovnik, where the aim was the eradication of the memory of the people that once occupied the land, an effort reminiscent of the [[Third Reich]] and the Nazi party. The attacks on the Herzegovinian city of Mostar, which in November 1993 led to the destruction of the Stari most bridge, internationally recognised as an outstanding cultural asset, led to the trial of six defendants before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in April 2006. Among them is the Croatian General Slobodan Praljak, who is suspected of having ordered the firing of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/prlic/4|title=Prlić et al.

=== Khmer Rouge Tribunal ===
The [[Khmer Rouge Tribunal]], established by the United Nations together with the government of Cambodia in July 2006, has the possibility of prosecuting the destruction of cultural assets during the [[Khmer Rouge]] dictatorship from April 1975 to January 1979, with explicit reference to the Hague Convention of 1954, pursuant to Article 7 of the Law on the Establishment of Extraordinary Chambers.&lt;ref&gt;Law on the establishment of extraordinary Chambers

https://www.eccc.gov.kh/sites/default/files/legal-documents/KR_Law_as_amended_27_Oct_2004_Eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, most of the more than 3,300 temples and 130 mosques in Cambodia were severely damaged by the Khmer Rouge. They also destroyed all 73 Catholic churches and many other sites of religious or cultural significance. The Hague Convention of 1954 can be applied in principle, since Cambodia became a party to the Convention in 1962, before the Khmer Rouge came to power, and because Article 19 of the Convention stipulates that even in non-international armed conflicts, each party to the conflict is bound at least by the provisions on respect for cultural property.

However, it is not yet known whether and to what extent trials will be instituted in the court which are based on the destruction of cultural property. A possible problem with the application of Article 7 and thus with the Hague Convention, is that it is a legal requirement to establish the existence of an armed conflict. This would then resemble the definition commonly used in international humanitarian law. Whether such an assessment of the Khmer Rouge dictatorship will be possible, cannot yet be predicted.

===Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL===
{{main|Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL}}

Deliberate destruction and theft of cultural heritage has been conducted by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] since 2014 in [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], and to a lesser extent in [[Libya]].  The destruction targets various places of worship under ISIL control and ancient historical artifacts. In Iraq, between the [[fall of Mosul]] in June 2014 and February 2015, ISIL has plundered and destroyed at least 28 historical religious buildings.&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mawtani.al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/iii/features/2015/02/13/feature-01|title=Iraq churches, mosques under ISIL attack|author=Khalid al-Taie|publisher=mawtani.al-shorfa.com|date=13 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219092526/http://mawtani.al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/iii/features/2015/02/13/feature-01|archivedate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The valuable items from some buildings were looted in order to smuggle and sell them to finance ISIL activities.&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"/&gt;

Although Libya, Syria and Iraq ratified the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict in 1957, 1958 and 1967 respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13637&amp;language=E&amp;order=alpha|title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention. The Hague|date=14 May 1954|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has not been effectively enforced.

== International Acceptance and Partnering Organisations ==
As of June 2018, 131 states have become party to the Hague Convention of 1954 and 109 states to the first protocol. 77 states have become party to the Second Protocol of 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/convention-and-protocols/states-parties/|title=States Parties {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]], France became a party in 1957. Russia is contracting party in legal succession of the Soviet Union, which also became party in 1957. the People's Republic of China ratified the convention in 2000 and the United States acceded in 2009. The United Kingdom signed the Agreement in 1954 and ratified the Convention and acceded to the Protocols in 2017.

The main reason for the long period between signature and ratification by the United States were the reservations of the [[US Department of Defense]] during the [[Cold War]], that the Convention's obligations regarding the possible use of nuclear weapons could not be fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usicomos.org/hague-convention-and-usicomos/|title=Hague Convention and US/ICOMOS|website=www.usicomos.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Joint Chiefs of Staff, to which the commanders-in-chief of all units of the American armed forces belong, unanimously declared itself in 1995 in favour of voluntary compliance with the Convention. On 6 January 1999, then US President Bill Clinton recommended that the US Senate ratify both agreements. In his opinion, they were not only in accordance with the principles and methods of the American Armed Forces, but were even based on them in essential aspects. After the Senate approved accession in September 2008, the US Ambassador to UNESCO, Stephen Engelken, handed over the instrument of ratification to [[Kōichirō Matsuura]], Secretary-General of UNESCO on 13 March 2009. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Convention on 14 May 2004, the Government of the United Kingdom declared its intention to become a party to the Convention and the two Protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archive.is/20121223133857/http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/media_releases/2452.aspx|title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT] UK To Ratify Convention Safeguarding Cultural Heri…|date=2012-12-23|work=archive.is|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the conclusion of the Second Protocol of 1999, which, in the view of the British government, eliminated essential weaknesses and ambiguities of the 1954 Convention. A draft law containing ratification of the Convention, the two protocols and criminal law provisions was announced by the UK government in November 2006.

=== UNESCO ===
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]), a legally independent specialized agency of the United Nations based in Paris, and is the most important international institution in the field of dissemination and implementation of the protection of cultural property in armed conflicts. It acts as depositary of the Hague Convention of 1954 and its two Protocols and administers the "International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection".

=== Blue Shield International ===
In addition, Blue Shield International (formerly the [[International Committee of the Blue Shield]], ICBS; in French Comité International du Bouclier Bleu, CIBB) has existed since 1996. Its mission is to improve international cooperation in the field of cultural heritage protection and to support local and regional activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53136889|title=A Blue shield for the protection of our endangered cultural heritage : proceedings of the open session co-organized by PAC core activity and the section on national libraries|date=2003|publisher=International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions, Core Acitivity on Preservation and Conservation|others=Koch, Corine., IFLA Programme on Preservation and Conservations.|isbn=2912743028|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=53136889}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Protocol of 1999 explicitly mentions in Articles 11 and 27 the consultative role of the International Committee of the Blue Shield in the implementation of the Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/convention-and-protocols/1999-second-protocol/text/|title=Text  {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the International Committee was founded in 2017, national Blue Shield Committees have already been established in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Benin, Brazil, Chile, Curacao, Denmark, France, Georgia, Guatemala, Haiti, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Madagascar, Macedonia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Senegal, Spain, the Czech Republic, Ukraine and the USA, comparable to the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]]. These national associations support the work of the International Committee in their respective home countries. The Association of the National Committees of the Blue Shield (ANCBS) was established on September 28, 2006 as its umbrella organization. Since 2017, all international activities have been bundled in Blue Shield International.

While in many wars the freedom of movement of United Nations personnel is significantly restricted due to security concerns, Blue Shield is regarded as particularly suitable due to its structure to act flexibly and autonomously in armed conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Gezielte Zerstörung von (Welt- )Kulturerbe in Krisenländern als Herausforderung für die Vereinten Nationen |author=Sabine Freifrau von Schorlemer |publisher=Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft mbH &amp; Co. KG.|isbn=9783848727872 |edition=1st |location=Baden-Baden |oclc=934159492}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the partial dissolution of state structures and the very unclear security situation resulting from the wars and unrest in Iraq, Syria, Mali, Egypt and Libya, the employees of Blue Shield and its national organizations then carried out very robust undertakings to protect the cultural assets there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/23_1/feature.html|title=Newsletter 23.1 Spring 2008|website=www.getty.edu|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concerns in particular the collection of cultural assets to be protected, the compilation with local experts of "no-strike lists" (- which preserve the coordinates of important cultural monuments), the linking of civil and military structures and the training of local military personnel with regard to the protection of cultural assets. From Blue Shield's point of view, it is not enough to develop and adopt international law norms such as the Second Protocol to the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict or the Doha Statement of the Conference of 'Ulamâ on Islam and Cultural Heritage'. It is necessary to implement these standards effectively on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://derstandard.at/2000012502400/Bildersturm-in-MossulKlassische-Normen-und-Uebereinkuenfte-versagen|title=Bildersturm: Die globalen Normen zum Schutz von Kulturgut greifen nicht - derStandard.at|website=DER STANDARD|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also concerns the prevention of the illicit trade in antiquities and stolen cultural assets to finance military conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/05/real-life-indiana-jones-vs-isis|title=Real-Life Indiana Jones Vs. ISIS|last=Hines|first=Nico|date=2015-07-05|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the destruction of cultural assets by armed conflict, war and unrest in Iraq, Syria, Mali or Afghanistan, but also by earthquakes such as in Haiti or Nepal, cooperation has developed between Blue-Shield and national armed forces such as the US Army or the British Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Cultural-Preservation-in/230055|title=Cultural Preservation in Disasters, War Zones Presents Big Challenges|date=2015-05-11|work=The Chronicle of Philanthropy|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other civil society structures ===
The "International League of National Societies for the Protection of Cultural Property", based in the Swiss city of Freiburg, was also established in May 1997 as an international umbrella organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dgks-ev.org/internationale-liga/|title=Internationale Liga – Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kulturgüterschutz e.V.|website=dgks-ev.org|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the activities of these national and international organisations and associations, which also include the protection of cultural property against disasters in times of peace, [[civil society]] structures will play an increasing role in the field of cultural property protection and support the work of state and international institutions.

One example of international cooperation in the protection of cultural assets was the temporary storage of art treasures from the National Museum in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]], in Switzerland. The art objects, which were severely threatened in the National Museum both by the [[Afghan Civil War (1996–2001)]] that lasted until 1995 and by the subsequent rule of the [[Taliban]] regime, were moved to a so-called "Afghanistan Museum in Exile" in the Swiss town of Bubendorf in 1999 with the consent of all parties to the conflict. The exhibition, which was supported primarily by the voluntary work of Swiss citizens and exiled Afghans, as well as by donations of around 1.5 million Swiss francs and supervised by the Swiss Afghanistan Institute based in Bubendorf, was open to the public from October 2000 to October 2006 and was visited by around 50,000 people during this time. In March 2007, the objects were returned to Kabul under the direction of UNESCO and with the support of the German Air Force. According to the spokesman of the Bubendorf Museum, this was the largest return of art objects since the end of the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.phototheca-afghanica.ch/afghanistanmuseum/|title=Internet - The Afghanistan Museum in Exile|website=www.phototheca-afghanica.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the Iraqi National Museum in [[Baghdad]] was seriously plundered from 8 to 12 April 2003, some three weeks after the start of the [[Iraq War]]. The museum was reopened only three years earlier on 28 April 2000, some nine years after its closure as a result of the war. Later investigations carried out by a US commission in collaboration with museum staff found evidence of at least three independent incidents.[1] According to the Commission's findings, the looting was sometimes spontaneous and indiscriminate. However, a number of indications also indicated that some of the thieves had a good knowledge of the museum and expert knowledge of the cultural assets on display. Although particularly valuable objects were kept in the cellar of the museum in the run-up to the war, considerable losses were also incurred here. The Commission corrected initial estimates of some 170,000 stolen works of art to 11,000 to 15,000 stolen objects. By the time the study results were published in 2005, about 5,000 of them had been recovered in various ways.

'''Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie''' (Helmholtz Center for Materials and Energy, HZB) is part of the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]]. The institute studies the structure and dynamics of materials and investigates [[solar cell]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/zentrum/beispiele-wissenschaft/index_en.html HZB: Research highlights]&lt;/ref&gt; Several large scale facilities are available, the most important of which are the 10 MW BER II [[nuclear research reactor]] at the Lise Meitner &lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT [[WP:Internal link|link]]; she is properly linked as the namesake in the history below --&gt; campus in [[Wannsee]] and the third-generation [[BESSY]] II [[synchrotron]] in [[Adlershof]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/zentrum/index_en.html Overview of HZB on the official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin was created on 1 January 2009 by the merger of Hahn-Meitner-Institut Berlin (HMI) and Berliner Elektronenspeicherring-Gesellschaft für Synchrotronstrahlung (BESSY), thus bringing BESSY into the Helmholtz Association.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/pubbin/news_seite?nid=14905&amp;sprache=de&amp;typoid=50025 Grünes Licht für die Fusion von HMI und BESSY: Official press release on the decided merger of the HMI and BESSY (German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hahn-Meitner-Institut Berlin (HMI), named after [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Lise Meitner]], was founded 14 March 1959 in Berlin-Wannsee to operate the BER I research reactor that began operation with 50 kW on 24 July 1958. Research originally focused on radiochemistry. In 1971, the federal government took over a 90% share in the HMI.

The Berliner Elektronenspeicherring-Gesellschaft für Synchrotronstrahlung ([[BESSY]]) was founded in 1979. The first synchrotron BESSY I in Berlin-Wilmersdorf began operations in 1982.

In January 2017, Henan Agricultural University and the [[International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center]] (CIMMYT, Texcoco, Mexico) signed a long-term collaborative agreement which will expand on the knowledge and capacities of each institution by setting up shared research programs in these important row crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cimmyt.org/press_release/china-launches-new-cimmyt-henan-agricultural-university-joint-maize-and-wheat-research-center/ |title=China launches new CIMMYT-Henan Agricultural University joint maize and wheat research center |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=January 11, 2017 |website=www.cimmyt.org |publisher=CIMMYT |access-date=June 13, 2017 |quote=The center was officially initiated with an agreement signed between the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and Henan Agricultural University (HAU)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists from CIMMYT and the university will collaborate and publish in a new state-of-the-art research center, benefiting the world of agricultural research as well as the smallholder farmer in wheat and maize growing regions around the world.

Henan Province produces over 6 million hectares of wheat and over 3 million hectares of maize, equating to more than 25% of China's wheat production and 10% of its maize. The CIMMYT collaboration will focus on scientist training and research as well as technological innovation in the plant sciences.

==Campus, art and culture==
The campus of Henan Agricultural University is at center of [[Zhengzhou]], the area is approximately 144000㎡. The design is made of themed parks on each side of campus. The design makes a good use of the [[drainage|drainage system]] and the natural environment; it makes students to have a better life in the campus.

==International students==
The school started to receive foreign students in 1987. To enable the foreign students to better adapt to university's life, they can start special courses as soon as possible. International Education College of Henan Agricultural University set up a Chinese training program in 2004. They have created a good environment and opportunities to study Chinese and understand Chinese culture.

There has been a long-standing '''influence of [[French language|French]] on [[English language|English]],''' in terms of [[syntax]], [[grammar]], [[lexicon]], spelling and pronunciation.

Most French vocabulary that entered English occurred after the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066 and the establishment of a French-speaking administration. French became the language of the court, the administration and the elites for several centuries, until after the [[Hundred Years War]]. English has been constantly influenced by French from that time till present day.
According to Laura K. Lawless, more than a third of the current [[English vocabulary]] is of French origin.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/frenchinenglish.htm |website=french.about.com |title=Terms of Enrichment: How French Has Influenced English |accessdate=2018-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216063051/http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/frenchinenglish.htm# |archive-date=2016-12-16 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to linguist [[Henriette Walter]], words of French origin represent more than two thirds of the English vocabulary. It is estimated by linguist Anthony Lacoudre that over 40 000 English words are directly French and may be understood without [[orthographical]] change by French speakers.&lt;ref name="dailymotion"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5vbb1z |title=L&amp;#039;incroyable histoire des mots français dans la langue anglaise – Vidéo dailymotion |website=dailymotion.com |accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of French in England ==

=== Before 1066 ===
At the beginning of XIth century, the English language did not have a well-defined status. Indeed, the inhabitants of what would become [[Great Britain]] did not have a language that allowed them to communicate with each other. There were many different [[dialect]]al forms. Great Britain, in which various [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] idioms had coexisted since the IVth century, had experienced partial [[Roman Empire|Roman occupation]] since the 1st century A.D., and this for four centuries.

From 450 onwards, the [[Saxons]], the [[Angles (people)|Angles]] and the [[Jutes]], who came from the continent, settled in the south and east. Germanic dialects would prevail in these regions, supplanting Celtic dialects, which would remain in the west and north of the island ([[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], [[Scotland]]) and [[Ireland]]. In the VIIIth century, [[Vikings]] from [[Scandinavia]] settled on the island. Their languages, also Germanic, in turn influence the languages already present on the island. Thus, at the dawn of XIth century, the country was made up of a series of peoples with significantly different speeches, most of them Germanic, with multiple influences.

=== Norman conquest of England and its consequences ===
It is therefore a linguistically disunited people that the Normans will get massively in contact with, from 1066. [[William II of Normandy]], supported by his King, [[Philip I of France]], and his blood legitimacy to the throne of England, landed at [[Hastings]], in [[Sussex]], on 29 September 1066. His men are deployed around the city waiting for the king [[Harold II]]'s troops. On October 14, exhausted by the long journey to Hastings, Harold II's troops lost the battle after a day. Following the defeat of the English, Duke William II of Normandy became King of England on December 25, 1066, crowned under the name of William I of England, also known as William the Conqueror. This date marks the beginning of a long period of ties between the peoples and languages.

In fact, these links already existed before the Battle of Hastings. Indeed, the geographical location of Normandy, facing the English Channel, favoured commercial contacts with England. These ties will be further strengthened at the beginning of the XIth century when the daughter of the Duke [[Richard II of Normandy]], Emma, marries King [[Æthelred II of England]]. But it is really from the 1066 conquest that [[proto-English]] becomes massively impregnated with [[Old French]], then modern French. It should be noted, however, that only French will influence English in the centuries following the conquest. The reverse contribution of English to French will only be real from the XVIIIth century.

The arrival of William the Conqueror and his barons significantly changed the linguistic situation in England. [[Norman language|Norman]] is essentially imposed in the upper layers of society. The Anglo-Saxon dialects were supplanted by Norman in the circles of the court and aristocracy, justice and the Church. The influential circles, who came from Normandy and settled in England, kept their Norman mother tongue, while the more modest rural and urban strata continued to speak English.

Norman is a particular variety of the [[Gallo-Roman]] language, spoken in Normandy. It is one of the [[Oil languages]] alongside, among others, the [[Picard language|Picard]] and the [[Walloon language|Walloon]]. The Norman language is modified in contact with the [[Anglo-Saxon]] language. It then integrates words and phrases from English and will give birth to a dialect, [[Anglo-Norman (language)|Anglo-Norman]], still spoken on the [[Anglo-Norman isles]]. Anglo-Norman can be described as a [[vernacular language]], on English soil in the XIth century, in the field of literature, culture, court and among the clergy. French was therefore, at first, spoken in England under the form of this Anglo-Norman dialect.

During the XIIth century, continental French has a greater influence on Old English. It acquires great prestige in England, especially within the aristocracy and the clergy. It becomes the language of law and justice nationwide. Rich and noble families, most of them of Norman origin, teach their children French or send them to study in France. The expansion of the French language in England was also encouraged by royal marriages. From [[Henry II Plantagenet]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] at the beginning of the century, to [[Henri VI]] and [[Marguerite of Anjou|Marguerite]] in the XVth century, all kings of England married French princesses. These marriages made French the language of the English court for several centuries and were decisive in strengthening the use of French in England. This period (XIIth-XVth centuries) is characterized by a massive influx of French words into Old English vocabulary.&lt;ref name="le-mot-juste-en-anglais"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.le-mot-juste-en-anglais.com/2013/09/linfluence-du-francais-sur-la-langue-anglaise.html |title=Comment le français a influencé la langue anglaise |website=Le mot juste en anglais |accessdate=2018-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120221242/https://www.le-mot-juste-en-anglais.com/2013/09/linfluence-du-francais-sur-la-langue-anglaise.html# |archive-date=2018-11-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1204, [[Philippe Auguste]] Normandy is officially annexed to the kingdom of France, politically isolating England from the continent. Normans who choose to stay in England move further away from France and, therefore, from the French language. Keeping its status as the language of justice and the language of power, England saw the first teaching manuals for teaching French to the English. These manuals were intended for English nobles who wish to perfect their knowledge of French and teach it to their children. Two types of French spoken in the higher spheres of English society can be distinguished during the XIIIth century : the Anglo-Norman dialect, which was the aristocrats' mother tongue, and a more prestigious type of French as a second language. Knowing "parisian" French was a mark of social distinction. As a language of culture, French supplanted Latin from the XIIth century onward as the language of diplomacy and worldly relations throughout Europe. The mass and influence of French literature reinforced its reputation and appeal.

=== The developing use of French ===
The [[XVIth century]], that of the [[Renaissance]], is a decisive century for French since king [[François I of France]], through the [[Ordonnance de Villers-Cotterêts]] ([[1539]]), makes French the official language of administration in the whole kingdom.
Although troubled by the [[European wars of religion]], the [[Italian Wars]], the language is marked by intellectual, technical and scientific effervescence. It ushered in an era of prosperity that would also spread to England through French.

The XVIIth century announces the apogee of the Kingdom of France. This period was characterized by the political, literary and artistic prestige of France and the French language. Peace restored and unity ensured in the country, economy grew considerably. Personalities such as the King [[Henri IV of France|Henri IV]], the [[Cardinal of Richelieu]] or the [[Sun King]] contribute to fixing and enhancing the French language in Europe, the Americas, India and Oceania.

The creation of the [[Académie française]] by Richelieu in 1635, under [[Louis XIII]], was a step that led to the standardization of French in continental Europe and abroad, including England. French is then the second language of all the elites in Europe, from Turkey to Ireland and from Moscow to Lisbon. The greatest scholars and intellectuals, writers and scientists, express themselves and correspond in this new standardised French. French is considered a perfect language, whose beauty and elegance are determined by the development of scientific logic, aided by dictionaries and grammars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/caief_0571-5865_1992_num_44_1_1775|title=Le Français face à l'anglais : aspects linguistiques|first=Michael D.|last=Picone|date=22 November 1992|publisher=|journal=Cahiers de l'Association internationale des études francaises|volume=44|issue=1|pages=9–23|doi=10.3406/caief.1992.1775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the XXIst Century ==
The geographical use of French has continuously and greatly diversified in the last five hundred years, with countries and states like [[New-Brunswick]], [[Quebec]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Benin]], [[Togo]], [[Guinea]], [[Cameroon]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Madagascar]], [[Mauritius]], [[Tchad]], [[Djibouti]], [[Senegal]], [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Lebanon]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Monaco]], [[Aosta Valley]], [[French Polynesia]], [[New Caledonia]], and [[Vanuatu]] adopting it as their official language. This geographical diversity has led to many different contacts with [[vernacular]] dialects, regional and international languages, from which French has often been enriched locally.
In a number of countries and regions where French shares co-officiality with English (Cameroon, [[Canada]], [[Jersey]], [[Mauritius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andre.thibault.pagesperso-orange.fr/IleMaurice.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311113430/http://andre.thibault.pagesperso-orange.fr/IleMaurice.pdf# |archive-date=2016-03-11 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rwanda]], Vanuatu), particular lexical regionalisms are observed where French and English terms are used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avenir-langue-francaise.fr/articles.php?pg=850|title=Avenir de la Langue Française (ALF) - Ile Maurice|first=|last=MAR|website=www.avenir-langue-francaise.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The contribution of the French lexicon to English ==
Several elements must be observed.

* Sometimes, the English words' form has kept traces of Old French, written or oral, such as certain consonants (''forest'' / forest) or certain vowels or diphthongs (''veil'' / voil; ''leisure'' / leisure), the current French sometimes deviating more from its old form than the English (i.e. Old French ''ante'' gives "tante" in modern French and is written 'aunt' in modern English).
* Many English nouns, verbs and adjectives borrowed from Old French have not always kept the meaning they had in Old French. Sometimes, they have developed a different meaning from French. In both cases, these words are [[false friend]]s (''egre'' giving 'sour' (''aigre'') in French while mutating into 'eager' in English).
* Other English words are composed of both words of French and Germanic origins (''handkerchief'': ''hand'' is from the proto-Germanic ''k'''hand'''uz'' and ''kerchief'' is a mutation on the old French ''core chief'')
* Some forms of Old French did not survive in modern French, while they still exist in English (''soulace'',''conceler'',''estriver'',''gone'').
* It is not uncommon either for an English concept to have two or even three vocabulary words to describe it, one of French origin, a part from proto-Germanic and another of Latin origin (''royal'', ''kingly'', and ''regal'' all mean the same thing, 'royal').
* Most of the English words ending in ''-ous'', ''-ty'' (on the model of ''-té''),''-tion'', ''-ture'', ''-ture'', ''-ent'' are of French origin.
* Uses in social and intellectual life, but also certain domestic and food uses, demonstrate the omnipresence of French in English society in many fields, for example the names of meat: "beef" comes from the French ''buef'' (beef), "mutton" from ''moton'' (sheep), "pork" from ''pork'', "veal" from ''vel'' (calf).
* Some words borrowed in the XIXth and XXth centuries are still considered foreign words, French words (such as ''chic''). They are generally used by educated English people or by the press and other media and are seen as part of a distinguished language.
* Some [[Anglicisms]] are actually words that were borrowed from French a long time ago and have recently been borrowed back from English (such as ''bacon'').

The following French glossary in English is in no way exhaustive. These words come as examples to illustrate the countless French words that are part of the English language.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In this section, examples of French-to-English lexical contributions are classified by field and in chronological order. The periods during which these words were used in the English language are specified as much as possible. It is not always possible to state with certainty the precise period from which a word was borrowed or integrated.

The English word is on the left, with its current French equivalent in brackets, then comes its Old French origin in bold and the century of its introduction on the right.

'''Large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping''' ('''LDDMM''') is a specific suite of algorithms used for diffeomorphic mapping and manipulating dense imagery based on  '''diffeomorphic metric mapping''' within the academic discipline of [[Computational anatomy]], to be distinguished from its precursor based on '''diffeomorphic mapping'''.  The distinction between the two is that diffeomorphic metric maps satisfy the property that the length associated to their flow away from the identity induces a metric on the [[Computational anatomy#The Diffeomorphism Group of Computational Anatomy|group of diffeomorphisms]], which in turn induces a metric on the orbit of [[Computational anatomy#Shapes and forms|Shapes and Forms]] within the field of [[Computational anatomy|Computational Anatomy]]. The study of shapes and forms with the metric of diffeomorphic metric mapping is called [[Computational Anatomy#Diffeomorphometry:the metric space of shapes and forms|Diffeomorphometry]].

A '''diffeomorphic mapping''' system is a system designed to map, manipulate, and transfer information which is stored in many types of spatially distributed medical imagery.

Diffeomorphic mapping is the underlying technology for mapping and analyzing information measured in human anatomical coordinate systems which have been measured via Medical imaging{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Diffeomorphic mapping is a broad term that actually refers to a number of different algorithms, processes, and methods. It is attached to many operations and has many applications for analysis and visualization. Diffeomorphic mapping can be used to relate various sources of information which are indexed as a function of spatial position as the key index variable. Diffeomorphisms are by their Latin root structure preserving transformations, which are in turn differentiable and therefore smooth, allowing for the calculation of metric based quantities such as arc length and surface areas. Spatial location and extents in human anatomical coordinate systems can be recorded via a variety of Medical imaging modalities, generally termed multi-modal medical imagery, providing either scalar and or vector quantities at each spatial location. Examples are scalar [[T1 (MRI)|T1]] or T2 [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic resonance imagery]], or as 3x3 diffusion tensor matrices [[Diffusion MRI]] and [[Diffusion-weighted imaging]], to scalar densities associated to [[Computed Tomography]] (CT), or functional imagery such as temporal data of [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and scalar densities such as [[Positron emission tomography|Positron emission tomography (PET)]].

Computational anatomy is a subdiscipline within the broader field of [[Neuroinformatics]] within [[Bioinformatics]] and [[Medical imaging]]. The first algorithm for dense image mapping via diffeomorphic metric mapping was Beg's LDDMM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220660081|title=Computing Large Deformation Metric Mappings via Geodesic Flows of Diffeomorphisms|journal=International Journal of Computer Vision|doi=10.1023/B:VISI.0000043755.93987.aa|access-date=2016-01-27|author1=M.F.

The distinction between diffeomorphic metric mapping forming the basis for LDDMM and the earliest methods of diffeomorphic mapping is the introduction of a Hamilton principle of least-action in which large deformations are selected of shortest length corresponding to geodesic flows. This important distinction arises from the original formulation of the [[Riemannian metric and Lie-bracket in computational anatomy|Riemannian metric]] corresponding to the right-invariance. The lengths of these geodesics give the metric in the metric space structure of human anatomy. Non-geodeisc formulations of diffeomorphic mapping in general does not correspond to any metric formulation.

Diffeomorphic ma'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''pping 3-dimensional coordinate systems as measured via high resolution dense imagery has a long history in 3-D beginning with [[CT scan|Computed Axial Tomography]] (CAT scanning) in the early 80's by the University of Pennsylvania group led by [[Ruzena Bajcsy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Multiresolution Elastic Matching|journal = Comput.

The central focus of the sub-field of '''[[Computational anatomy]] (CA)''' within [[medical imaging]]  is mapping information across anatomical coordinate systems at the 1 millimeter [[morphome]] scale. In CA mapping of dense information measured within [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic resonance image]] (MRI) based coordinate systems such as in the brain has been solved via inexact matching of 3D MR images one onto the other. The earliest introduction of the use of '''diffeomorphic mapping''' via '''large deformation''' flows of [[diffeomorphisms]] for transformation of coordinate systems in image analysis and medical imaging was by Christensen, Rabbitt and Miller &lt;ref name="Christensen 1435–1447"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Deformable Templates Using Large Deformation Kinematics|journal = Trans.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of flows, which are akin to the equations of motion used in fluid dynamics, exploit the notion that dense coordinates in image analysis follow the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian and Eulerian]] equations of motion. This model becomes more appropriate for cross-sectional studies in which brains and or hearts are not necessarily deformations of one to the other. Methods based on linear or non-linear elasticity energetics which grows with distance from the identity mapping of the template, is not appropriate for cross-sectional study. Rather, in models based on Lagrangian and Eulerian flows of diffeomorphisms, the constraint is associated to topological properties, such as open sets being preserved, coordinates not crossing implying uniqueness and existence of the inverse mapping, and connected sets remaining connected.  The use of diffeomorphic methods grew quickly to dominate the field of mapping methods post Christensen's original paper, with fast and symmetric methods becoming available.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Such methods are powerful in that they introduce notions of regularity of the solutions so that they can be differentiated and local inverses can be calculated. The disadvantages of these methods is that there was no associated global least-action property which could score the flows of minimum energy. This contrasts the geodesic motions which are central to the study of  [[Rigid-body kinematics|Rigid body kinematics]] and the many problems solved in [[Physics]] via&lt;nowiki/&gt; [[Hamilton's principal of least action|Hamilton's principle of least action]].

\doteq \{ I = I_{temp} \circ \varphi, \varphi \in Diff_V \} &lt;/math&gt;. The template is mapped onto the target by defining a variational problem in which the template is transformed via the diffeomorphism used as a change of coordinate to minimize a squared-error matching condition between the transformed template and the target.

The diffeomorphisms are generated via smooth flows  &lt;math&gt;\phi_t,  t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; , with &lt;math&gt;\varphi \doteq \phi_1&lt;/math&gt;, satisfying the [[Computational anatomy#Lagrangian and Eulerian flows for generating diffeomorphisms|Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field]] associated to the ordinary differential equation,

In CA the space of vector fields &lt;math&gt;(V, \| \cdot \|_V )&lt;/math&gt; are modelled as a [[Computational anatomy#The Smoothness Condition on Vector fields as Modelled in a Reproducing kernel Hilbert space|reproducing Kernel Hilbert space]] (RKHS) defined by a 1-1, differential operator&lt;math&gt; A: V \rightarrow V^*  &lt;/math&gt; determining the norm &lt;math&gt;  \| v\|_V^2 \doteq \int_{R^3} Av\cdot v dx, \ v \in V \ ,
&lt;/math&gt; 
where the integral is calculated by integration by parts when &lt;math&gt;Av&lt;/math&gt; is a generalized function  in the dual space &lt;math&gt; V^*&lt;/math&gt;. 
The differential operator is selected so that the Green's kernel, the inverse of the operator, is continuously differentiable in each variable implying that the [[Computational anatomy#The Smoothness Condition on Vector fields as Modelled in a Reproducing kernel Hilbert space|vector fields support 1-continuous derivative]]; see&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dupuis |first1=Paul |last2=Grenander |first2=Ulf |last3=Miller |first3=Michael I. |title=Variational problems on flows of diffeomorphisms for image matching |journal=Quarterly of Applied Mathematics |date=1 September 1998 |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=587–600 |doi=10.1090/qam/1632326}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the necessary conditions on the norm for existence of solutions.

{{NumBlk||&lt;math&gt; \begin{cases}
&amp;v_t^{new}(\cdot) = v_t^{old}(\cdot) - \epsilon(v_t^{old} +  \sum_i  K(\cdot, \phi_t^{old}(x_i)) (D \phi_{t1})^{oldT}|_{\phi_t^{old}(x_i)} (y_i-\phi_1^{old}(x_i)), t \in [0,1]

This implies that the fixed point satisfy 
:&lt;math&gt; Av_0= -\sum_i (D \phi_1)(x_i)^T (y_i - \phi_1(x_i)) \delta_{x_i} &lt;/math&gt;

First Order Variation of the Flow and Vector Field for Dense Image and Landmark Matching |

The first order variation in the vector fields &lt;math&gt;v+\epsilon \delta v&lt;/math&gt; requires the variation of  &lt;math&gt;\phi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; generalizes the [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] [[Invertible matrix#Derivative of the matrix inverse|perturbation of the inverse]]  via &lt;math&gt;(\phi + \epsilon \delta \phi \circ \phi)\circ (\phi^{-1} + \epsilon \delta \phi^{-1} \circ \phi^{-1}) = id + o(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; giving  &lt;math&gt;\delta \phi^{-1} \circ \phi^{-1} =-(D \phi_1^{-1}) \delta \phi  &lt;/math&gt; . 
To express the variation in terms of &lt;math&gt; \delta v &lt;/math&gt;, use the solution to the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]]
&lt;math&gt;\frac{d }{d t} \left( \delta \phi_{|\phi} \right) = (Dv)_{| \phi} \delta \phi_{| \phi} + \delta v_{| \phi}&lt;/math&gt; giving
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta \phi_1 = (D \phi_1)_{|\phi_1^{-1}} \int_0^1 (D \phi_t)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}^{-1} (\delta v_t )_{\phi_t \circ \phi_1^{-1} } dt
&lt;/math&gt;

*Image Matching:
Taking the directional derivative of the image endpoint condition &lt;math&gt; E(\phi) = \int_X | I \circ \phi^{-1} - J |^2 dx &lt;/math&gt; gives
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{d \epsilon} \frac{1}{2} \int_X | I \circ ( \phi^{-1} + \epsilon \delta \phi^{-1} \circ \phi^{-1})-J|^2 dx|_{\epsilon =0}
=\int_X (I \circ \phi^{-1} -J ) \nabla I|_{\phi^{-1}} \delta \phi^{-1} \circ \phi^{-1} dx
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;
= \int_X (I \circ \phi^{-1} -J ) \nabla I|_{\phi^{-1}} 
(-D \phi_1^{-1}) \delta \phi dx

:&lt;math&gt; =\int_X(I \circ \phi_1^{-1} -J) \nabla I|_{\phi_1^{-1}} (- D \phi_1)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}^{-1}(D \phi_1)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}) \int_0^1 (D \phi_t)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}^{-1} (\delta v_t)_{|{\phi_t \circ \phi_1^{-1}}} dt dx
&lt;/math&gt;.
 
Substituting &lt;math&gt;
\phi_{t1} \doteq \phi_1 \circ \phi_t^{-1} &lt;/math&gt; gives the necessary condition for an optimum:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{d \epsilon}C(v +\epsilon\delta v)|_{\epsilon=0} = \int_0^1 \int_X Av_t \cdot \delta v_t dx dt -\int_0^1 \int_X (I \circ \phi_1^{-1} -J) \nabla I|_{\phi_1^{-1}}(D \phi_t)_{|\phi_1^{-1}}^{-1} (\delta v_t)_{|{\phi_t \circ \phi_1^{-1}}} dx dt

&lt;/math&gt;.

*Landmark Matching: 
Take the variation in the vector fields &lt;math&gt;v+\epsilon \delta v&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i} |\phi_1(x_i)-y_i)|^2 &lt;/math&gt;
use the chain rule for the perturbation &lt;math&gt; \delta \phi \circ \phi &lt;/math&gt; to gives the first variation

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_i (\phi_1(x_i) - y_i) \cdot D \phi_1 |_{\phi_1^{-1}(\phi_1(x_i))} \int_0^1 (D \phi_t)_{|\phi_1^{-1}(\phi_1(x_i))}^{-1} \delta v_t |_{\phi_t \circ \phi_1^{-1} (\phi_1(x_i))} dt

==LDDMM ODF ==
High angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) addresses the well-known limitation of DTI, that is, DTI can only reveal one dominant fiber orientation at each location. HARDI measures diffusion along &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; uniformly distributed directions on the sphere and can characterize more complex fiber geometries by reconstructing an orientation distribution function (ODF) that characterizes the angular profile of the diffusion probability density function of water molecules. The ODF is a function defined on a unit sphere, &lt;math&gt; {\mathbb{S}}^2 &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Du|first1=J|last2=Goh|first2=A|last3=Qiu|first3=A|title=Diffeomorphic metric mapping of high angular resolution diffusion imaging based on Riemannian structure of orientation distribution functions|journal=IEEE Trans Med Imaging|date=2012|volume=31|issue=5|pages=1021–1033|doi=10.1109/TMI.2011.2178253|pmid=22156979}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Denote the square-root ODF (&lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{\text{ODF}}} &lt;/math&gt;) as &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \psi({\bf s}) &lt;/math&gt; is non-negative to ensure uniqueness and &lt;math&gt; \int_{{\bf s}\in  {\mathbb{S}}^2} \psi^2({\bf s}) d{\bf s}=1&lt;/math&gt;. The metric defines the distance between two &lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{\text{ODF}}} &lt;/math&gt; functions &lt;math&gt; \psi_1, \psi_2 \in \Psi &lt;/math&gt; as 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\rho(\psi_1,\psi_2)=
\|\log_{\psi_1}(\psi_2)\|_{\psi_1} 
=\cos^{-1} \langle \psi_1, \psi_2 \rangle = 
\cos^{-1}\left(\int_{{\bf s}\in {\mathbb{S}}^2} \psi_1({\bf s}) \psi_2({\bf s})d{\bf s}\right),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is the normal dot product between points in the sphere under the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{L}^2 &lt;/math&gt; metric.
The template and target are denoted
&lt;math&gt; \psi_{\mathrm{temp}}({\bf s},x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\psi_{\mathrm{targ}}({\bf s}, x)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt; {\bf s} \in {{\mathbb{S}}^2} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; x \in X &lt;/math&gt; indexed across the unit sphere and the image domain, with the target indexed similarly.

Define the variational problem assuming that two ODF volumes can be generated from one to another via flows of diffeomorphisms &lt;math&gt; \phi_t &lt;/math&gt;, which are solutions of ordinary differential equations 
&lt;math&gt; \dot \phi_t = v_t (\phi_t), t \in [0,1],\phi_0={id}&lt;/math&gt;. 
The group action of the diffeomorphism on the template is given according to  
&lt;math&gt;\phi_1 \cdot \psi (x)\doteq  (D\phi_1) \psi \circ \phi_1^{-1}(x), x \in X &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt; (D\phi_1) &lt;/math&gt; is the Jacobian of the affined transformed ODF and is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(D \phi_1) \psi\circ \phi_1^{-1}(x) =   \sqrt{\frac{\det{\bigl(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1}} }{\left\|{\bigl(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} } {\bf s} \right\|^3} } \quad
\psi \left( \frac{(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}}{\|(D_{\phi_1^{-1}}\phi_1 \bigr)^{-1} {\bf s}\|}, \phi_1^{-1}(x) \right) .
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The LDDMM variational problem is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\min_{v: \dot \phi_t =
v_t \circ \phi_t,\phi_0={
id}}\int_0^1 \int_{R^3} Av_t \cdot v_t dx \ dt 
 +\lambda \int_{R^3}\|\log_{(D\phi_1) \psi_{\mathrm{temp}} \circ \phi_1^{-1}(x)}(\psi_{\mathrm{targ}}(x))\|^2_{(D\phi_1) \psi_{\mathrm{temp}}\circ \phi_1^{-1}(x)}dx 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.

| Proof of Hamiltonian Dynamics
|
The [[Computational anatomy#Hamiltonian formulation of Computational Anatomy|Hamiltonian dynamics]] with advected state and control dynamics  &lt;math&gt; q_t = I \circ \phi_t^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \dot q = - \nabla q \cdot v &lt;/math&gt; with extended Hamiltonian 
&lt;math&gt; H(q,p,v) = (p|-\nabla q \cdot v ) -\frac{1}{2} (Av|v) &lt;/math&gt; gives the variational problem&lt;ref name="Miller 447–509"/&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;
\min_{p,q,v} C(p,q,v) \doteq (p|\dot q)-\left( (p|-\nabla q \cdot v ) -\frac{1}{2} (Av|v) \right) + E(q_1)
= (p|\dot q) - H(p,q,v) +E(q_1) \ .
&lt;/math&gt;
The first variation gives the condition on the optimizing vector field &lt;math&gt;Av=-p\nabla q &lt;/math&gt;, with the endpoint condition &lt;math&gt;
 p_1=-\frac{\partial E}{\partial q}(q_1)
&lt;/math&gt; and dynamics on the Lagrange multipliers determined by the Gatteux derivative conditions &lt;math&gt;
 (-\dot p - \nabla \cdot (pv) | \delta q) ) =0

&lt;/math&gt; and the state &lt;math&gt;

( \delta p | \dot q + \nabla q \cdot v  ) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;.

'''''The Lives of Flemish, German, and Dutch painters''''' refers to a compilation of artist biographies by [[Jean-Baptiste Descamps]] published in the mid 18th-century that were accompanied by illustrations by [[Charles Eisen]]. The list of illustrations follows and is in page order by volume. Most of the biographies were translated into French from earlier work by [[Karel van Mander]] and [[Arnold Houbraken]]. The illustrated portraits were mostly based on engravings by [[Jan Meyssens]] for [[Het Gulden Cabinet]] and by Arnold and [[Jacobus Houbraken]] for their ''[[Schouburgh]]'', while the work examples engraved in the margins of the portraits were mostly based on engravings by [[Jacob Campo Weyerman]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4983">'''Maintenance Engineering''' is the discipline and profession of applying [[engineering]] concepts for the optimization of equipment, procedures, and departmental budgets to achieve better [[maintainability]], [[Reliability engineering|reliability]], and availability of equipment.

Maintenance, and hence maintenance engineering, is increasing in importance due to rising amounts of equipment, systems, machineries and infrastructure.  Since the [[Industrial Revolution]], devices, equipment, machinery and structures have grown increasingly complex, requiring a host of personnel, vocations and related systems needed to maintain them.&lt;ref name="Dhillon"/&gt; Prior to 2006, the United States spent approximately US$300 billion annually on plant maintenance and operations alone.&lt;ref name="Dhillon"&gt;Dhillon, Balbir S. (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=nxT-wxeVVIQC Maintainability, Maintenance, and Reliability for Engineers], CRC Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8493-7243-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8493-7243-8}};&lt;/ref&gt;
Maintenance is to ensure a unit is fit for purpose, with maximum availability at minimum costs.
A person practicing '''Maintenance Engineering''' is known as a '''Maintenance Engineer'''.

== Maintenance Engineer's Essential knowledge ==

A Maintenance Engineer should possess significant knowledge of [[statistics]], [[probability]] and [[logistics]], and additionally in the fundamentals of the operation of the equipment and machinery he or she is responsible for.

A Maintenance Engineer shall also possess high interpersonal, communication, and management skills, as well as the ability to make decisions quickly.

== Typical Maintenance Engineering Responsibilities ==
Typical responsibilities include:&lt;ref&gt;Mobley, Keith R. &amp; Higgins, Lindley R. &amp; Wikoff, Darrin J. (2008) [https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;id=O8Fcf-VIliwC&amp;dq=maintenance+engineering+handbook&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=64-5OGeEgg&amp;sig=hspdMJ5Oe5Hz4T0qyjdh0XUoYoE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Maintenance Engineering Handbook], McGraw-Hill Professional, Seventh Edition, 2008, {{ISBN|0-07-154646-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-07-154646-1}};&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assure optimization of the Maintenance Organization structure
* Analysis of repetitive equipment failures
* Estimation of maintenance costs and evaluation of alternatives
* Forecasting of spare parts
* Assessing the needs for equipment replacements and establish replacement programs when due
* Application of [[Scheduling (production processes)|scheduling]] and [[project management]] principles to replacement programs
* Assessing required maintenance tools and skills required for efficient maintenance of equipment
* Assessing required skills for maintenance personnel
* Reviewing personnel transfers to and from maintenance organizations
* Assessing and reporting [[safety hazard]]s associated with maintenance of equipment

== Maintenance Engineering Education ==

Institutions across the world have recognised the need for Maintenance Engineering. Maintenance Engineers usually hold a degree in [[Mechanical Engineering]], [[Industrial Engineering]], or other Engineering Disciplines. In recent years specialised bachelor and master courses have developed. The [[Bachelor Degree]] program in Maintenance Engineering at the [[German-Jordanian University]] in Amman is addressing the need, as well as the Bachelor Programme in Maintenance Engineering at [[Luleå University of Technology]]. With an increased demand for Chartered Engineers, The [[University of Central Lancashire]] in United Kingdom has developed a MSc in Maintenance Engineering currently under accreditation with the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] and a Top-up [[Bachelor of Engineering]] with honour degree for technicians holding a [[Higher National Diploma]] and seeking a progression in their professional career.

In 2001 Weiner-Davis released a sequel to ''[[Divorce Busting]]'', ''The Divorce Remedy'':''The Proven 7-Step Program for Saving Your Marriage''.&lt;ref name="save"/&gt; After hearing from thousands of readers over the years who asked particular questions about their own marital circumstances, Weiner-Davis extracted the ideas from her experience and past books and then broke down the ideas into seven specific steps a person could follow. She also discusses some other key relationship issues such as [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[infidelity]], [[Internet addiction disorder|Internet obsession]], [[sexual problems]] &amp; [[midlife crisis]].

In 2003 Weiner-Davis released her book ''The Sex-Starved Marriage'': ''A Couple's Guide to Boosting Their Marriage Libido''.&lt;ref name="Savers"/&gt;  She found herself writing about this particular subject after she saw a pattern developing in her practice&lt;ref name="appetite"/&gt; and determined that a lack of physical intimacy between couples had been leading couples further apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Weiner-Davis' latest book ''Healing From Infidelity: The Divorce Busting Guide to Rebuilding Your Marriage After an Affair'' was released in January 2017. Due to the high percentage of couples in her practice who face betrayal, she developed a step-by-step program for rebuilding trust and reinventing couples' marriages.

The '''Mierzanowice culture''' appeared in the area of the upper and middle basin of the Vistula, during the Early Bronze Age. It evolved from the so-called Protomierzanowice cultural unit.  The name of the culture comes from an eponymous site in [[Mierzanowice]], where the cemetery was located. This entity was part of the precarpathian sphere epicorded cultures and it has been divided into three local groups: samborzecka, iwanowicka and pleszowska.&lt;ref name="lce.lublin.pl"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lce.lublin.pl/archeo/eneolit/eneo_2.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115215143/http://www.lce.lublin.pl/archeo/eneolit/eneo_2.html |title=Kultura mierzanowicka |archivedate=15 January 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial phases of functioning of the mentioned culture are characterized by a small number of burials, seasonal settlements and single artifacts. The area of the Mierzanowice culture spread over from western Slovakia, through south - eastern Poland, reaching in the east the areas of the Volhynian Upland.&lt;ref name="kaczanowski 142"&gt;Kaczanowski and Kozłowski, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology ==
Based on relative dating, Mierzanowice culture appeared in the Early Bronze Age. According to the archaeologist Jan Machnik, we distinguish the older and younger phase of this cultural unit. The discovery in Szarbia Zwierzyniecka allowed for a certain "rejuvenation" of the Mierzanowice culture as a result of the distinction of its late phase called ''szarbiańska''.&lt;ref name="kaczanowski 142"/&gt; The younger phase of the Mierzanowice culture was expended at the end of bronze A1 and the beginning of bronze A2 according to Paul Reinecke chronology. 

== Burial ==
Cemeteries of the Mierzanowice cultural population were established near the settlements. The largest cemeteries were from 150 to 300 burials.&lt;ref name="lce.lublin.pl"/&gt; The burial occurred mainly in skeletal form. Human remains were put into oval or rectangular burial pits or in coffins made of wooden logs. There were two systems for arranging human corpses: in the shrunken position and in straight position. The bodies of men were buried on the right side while corpses of women on the left side. The results of investigations conducted at the cemeteries of the Mierzanowice culture, showed a little advantage of men's graves over women's graves,&lt;ref name="kaczanowski 144"/&gt; which had slightly poorer grave inventory. 




== Settlement ==
Settlements of the Mierzanowice culture in most cases are represented by small and seasonal camps. Settlements with a larger area were founded on the hills with a naturally defensive character, near water reservoirs. A relatively large part of the archaeological sites of this culture are found on loess uplands. The best – known settlement of the Mierzanowice culture is archaeological site called Iwanowice. In the classical phase of the Mierzanowice culture, the settlements were mostly accompanied by cemeteries. 

== Artifacts ==
One of the most common objects discovered in archaeological sites in the Mierzanowice culture are axes and sickles.&lt;ref name="kaczanowski 144"&gt;Kaczanowski and Kozłowski, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of artifacts are neklaces made of faience and bones. The Mierzanowice culture is well known for its earrings in the shape of a willow leaf, often produced in local workshops. Military objects discovered in the settlements are primarily arrowheads on the shape of leaves. The faience beads are an extremely common element of the funeral inventory. The next category is pottery. In vascular ceramics the influences of the Corded Ware culture are visible. Pottery of the late phase of Mierzanowice culture is characterized by a huge variety of forms and ornamentation

The '''National Institute of Oceanography''', founded on 1 January 1966 as one of 37 constituent [[laboratory|laboratories]] of the [[CSIR India|CSIR]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csir.res.in/ CSIR India].&lt;/ref&gt; is an autonomous research organization in India to undertake scientific research and studies of special oceanographic features of the Northern Indian Ocean. Headquartered in [[Goa]], it has regional centres in  [[Kochi, India|Kochi]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Vizag]]. 

NIO ([[Indian_Ocean#Oceanography|oceanography]]) as well as [[Archaeological Survey of India|ASI]] ([[Archaeology in India|archaeology]]), [[Botanical Survey of India|BSI]] ([[Flora of India|botany]]), [[Forest Survey of India|FSI]] ([[Forestry in India|forests]]), [[Fishery Survey of India|FiSI]] ([[Fishing|fisheries]]), [[Geological Survey of India|GSI]] ([[Geology of India|geology]]), [[Indian Institute of Ecology and Environment|IIEE]] ([[Environmental issues in India|ecology]]), [[Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India|RGCCI]] ([[Census of India]]), [[Survey of India|SI]] ([[Cartography of India|cartography]]) and [[Zoological Survey of India|ZSI]] ([[Wildlife of India|zoology]]) are key national survey organisations of India.

== History ==
By the 1950s the community of oceanographers around the world had realized that while progress had been made in describing and in understanding the observed features of the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans, the Indian Ocean had remained relatively unexplored. It was important to address the fundamental oceanographic problems linked to monsoonal cycles experienced by the northern Indian Ocean; chemical characteristics of the water column; abundance and distribution of food resources like fish productivity and to understand the geology of the Indian Ocean through sea bed mapping and sampling.

Areas such as these are important not only to the global community of researchers, but also to the large population that lives in the countries around the Indian Ocean in general and the North Indian Ocean in particular. As a consequence, the global community of oceanographers organized the [[USS Mobjack (AGP-7)#International Indian Ocean Expedition|International Indian Ocean Expedition]] (IIOE) during 1959-65 to describe and understand the basic features of the Indian Ocean. The Government of India was an enthusiastic participant in this expedition. As the IIOE approached its concluding phase, the government decided that the Indians who participated in the expedition needed to have an institution where they could build on the oceanographic research skills they picked up during the expedition. It is out of such considerations that the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) came into being. [[Padma Shri]] [[Dr. N.K.Panikkar]] was appointed Director of this Institute, a post which he held till he retired in May 1973.

From humble beginnings, NIO has grown in size. Today, the institute is home to about 170 scientists (sanctioned strength is 200) of whom about 120 are Ph.D. holders, about 210 technical and supporting staff, and close to 120 administrative staff.  The staff is spread across four campuses.  The main campus is at Dona Paula, Goa.  About 80% of the staff work here.  NIO has three Regional Centres, which are located in Mumbai, Kochi and Visakhapatnam.  About 20% of NIO staff is located at these centres.

== Research contribution ==
An example of the dual role is a project on polymetallic nodules that has been sponsored by the Government of India at the institute for well over 25 years.  By the late 1970s the government had decided that the country needed to enhance its resources of minerals of strategic interest. NIO was given the responsibility of exploring the oceans for this purpose.  On 26 January 1981, NIO hauled up polymetallic nodules from a depth of 4,800 m in the western Indian Ocean using its first research vessel, RV Gaveshani, which was acquired in 1976.

Subsequently, work by NIO researchers helped India to gain the status of "Pioneer Investor" from the International Sea Bed Authority.  While this research was aimed at placing the country in a strategically enhanced position, it also provided the Institute an opportunity to study the marine geology and geophysics of the Indian Ocean. Some of the issues they addressed are the following: Evolution of the Indian tectonic plates and its implications; determination of the time when the Himalayas started rising leading to monsoonal climate of the Indian subcontinent; nature of mid-ocean ridges (where new crusts form); characteristics of marine sedimentary facies; the role of rivers on the Indian subcontinent in marine sediment budget and paleoclimatic evolution  as archived in the sediment cores.

During the first decade and a half of its founding, besides  developing its main campus at Goa, a major project taken up by the Institute was organizing the first Indian Expedition to Antarctica in 1981. This  project, together with exploration for polymetallic nodules,  established close ties between NIO and the then Department of Ocean Development and subsequently the Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India. These ties helped the institute to grow while the government expanded the infrastructure for ocean research, technology and services in the country.

Since the early 1980s, an important theme for basic research in the Institute has been, and continues to be, understanding oceanographic implications of the special characteristics of the North Indian basin, which has some unique features: the basin is strictly tropical, with the Asian landmass restricting it south of about 25 degrees N; it is a relatively small basin when compared to the North/South Atlantic/Pacific and even the South Indian Ocean and, of course, there is the seasonality imposed by the monsoons.  In the figure above red areas represent areas with elevation of a few kilometers. The presence of the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas influences the monsoons.

NIO's scientists have made handsome contributions to understanding the implications of these special features through observations and analyses.  The former have included ship-based observations, time-series data collected with moored instruments and satellite data.  ORV Sagar Kanya, which was acquired by the Government of India for use by oceanographic research institutions in India, has been playing a major role in these observations.

As noted earlier, an important theme of research at NIO has been understanding the oceanography of the North Indian Ocean – a tropical and small basin driven by strongly seasonal winds.  The uppermost 200 m (oceans are on average about 4000 m deep) form the most active portion of the ocean.  Here, major currents are forced by winds, and primary producers (microscopic plants that drift with currents) set the stage for intricate interactions that go across the traditional boundaries between disciplines, leading to a new discipline, biogeochemistry of the oceans.  Some of NIO's most cited research contributions have been about two aspects of the upper layer: its circulation and biogeochemistry.  Currents in this layer are driven by winds.  As these are periodic over the North Indian Ocean, so are the currents, in striking contrast to other tropical regions of the world.  The link between the winds and currents, however, is rather intricate.  NIO researchers played a leading role in defining the nature of seasonality in the currents over the basin in general, and along the coast of India in particular.  Subsequent analysis and model studies showed that the circulation of the North Indian Ocean needs to be looked at holistically across the basin because the winds at a location influence not only the local current, but affect the current at remote locations at a later time owing to the propagation of large-scale waves.  For example, it is now known that the winds along the Indian east coast significantly affect the seasonal cycle of the current off the Indian west coast.

By restricting the North Indian Ocean to south of 25o N, the Asian landmass prevents the basin from having access to the sub-tropical convergence zone, a region that usually occurs at a latitude of about 40o and is an important supplier of oxygen to the ocean.  Not having access to such a regime, the North Indian Ocean is starved of oxygen.  Another reason why oxygen is low is the consequence of high concentration of the primary producers of the region.  When these plants and zooplankton  that feed on them die and sink they get microbially degraded, thus consuming oxygen.  NIO researchers have played a major role in answering critical questions concerning the processes that go on in this basin with lower than normal oxygen levels.  Some of the questions that have been addressed are the following:  Does the monsoon cycle lead to other seasonal cycles, such as that of biological production and flux of sinking particles?  What are the special features of biogeochemistry of the ocean regime with low oxygen?  How do the biogeochemical processes (denitrification, for example) that characterize this system work?  What are the physical processes that sustain high productivity in the region?  How does the monsoon cycle influence temporal evolution of ecosystems in the region?

The research contributions (journal publications, reports, books, etc.) from the Institute that provide details about the contributions mentioned above are available from the NIO website, www.nio.org.  NIO's journal publications have shown a robust growth during the last few years.

== Intellectual property ==
NIO holds about 50 patents (see www.nio.org for the list), 60% of which has come from marine biotechnology studies. Organisms living in the marine environment carry molecules that could prove beneficial in developing new drugs and other products for healthcare. This is a new area of research that NIO's researchers are pursuing. Their studies have yielded research publications and intellectual property for the institute.

Another area of research that has generated patents for the institute is marine instrumentation. Some recent technologies developed by the institute include one for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV): the [[Maya AUV India|Maya AUV]].

== Services ==
Wearing the other hat – putting knowledge to use – NIO researchers have undertaken a number of projects in service of the industry in India. One of the first projects taken up by NIO on acquiring its research vessel RV Gaveshani was demarcation of a pipeline for carrying oil from India's first offshore oil field at Bombay High.  This project was undertaken at the request of India's public sector organization, the Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC).  Since then, NIO has carried out a number of projects for India's public sector undertakings and private enterprises.  The list of NIO's clientele includes major petroleum companies and ports. NIO's services have been used in the development of coastal areas by Bharuch Eco-Aqua Infrastructure Ltd., Ankleshwar, and Coastal Marine Construction &amp; Engineering Ltd., Mumbai.  NIO's services have also been sought by central and state governments.  Sponsored and consultancy projects taken up by NIO include Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), Coastal Zone Management, Resource Surveys, Biofouling &amp; Corrosion studies, and development of marine instruments.

A problem that has been worrying governments around the world during recent years is the transfer of organisms from one port to another located far away owing to transfer of water used by ships for ballast.  Such transfer has been shown to lead sometimes to uncontrolled growth of organisms alien to the local ecology, which can then wipe out local fisheries.  NIO scientists have played a major role in spreading awareness of the problem in India.  In recognition of their efforts, the Directorate General of Shipping, Government of India, has sought NIO's help to develop plans for ballast water management in major Indian ports.

== Facilities for research ==
The [http://did.nio.org NIO Data Centre (NIODC)] acquires, processes, formats and stores data generated by the Institute (from about 1000 cruises during 1973 to 2009) in a database for easy and efficient retrieval and supply to end users. Information about data held by NIO can be accessed from [http://did.nio.org http://did.nio.org].

The [http://drs.nio.org library] of the Institute has a collection of over 35,000 books and bound volumes of journals is almost certainly the largest such collection in the country in the field of oceanography.  Besides the print collection, the library has on-line access to over 3,000 journals either by direct subscription or as a part of a consortium.  Participation of the library in international programmes has made this library a source of information about Indian oceanographic studies for the rest of the world and also to network with other, larger libraries to access documents not available in its holdings. 
 
Research at the institute is supported by a large number of well-equipped laboratories on its campuses and by the seagoing capability offered by its ships. To support its multi-disciplinary ocean research programmes, the institute plans to maintain a fleet of three research vessels.  The smallest of these is the 23 m long coastal research vessel CRV Sagar Sukti.  The recently acquired 56.5 m long RV Sindhu Sankalp serves primarily on the continental margins, but it is capable of open-sea voyages.  NIO's 80 m long research vessel RV Sindhu Sadhana, which will be capable of full open-sea studies, is under construction at the ABG Shipyard, Surat.  It is expected to join the institute during 2011-12.

The institute has, over time, developed the capability of deploying and retrieving instruments hoisted over moorings in depths from 5 to 5,000 m.  These instruments record time-series data during the period of deployment, which can be as long as two years.

== Opportunities to pursue research and doctoral studies ==
To support its varied activities, NIO uses the services of limited-tenure staff, including doctoral students, project assistants and post-doctoral fellows.  Their numbers have grown significantly with the growth in research programmes.  The largest increase has been in the number of project assistants since CSIR introduced the "Project Assistant Scheme" to tap the services of fresh graduates for enhancing the productivity of its institutions.  Hired regularly through walk-in interviews, the fresh graduates are permitted by this scheme to gain hands-on exposure to oceanographic research.  The graduates also have the option of  becoming doctoral students through the Senior Research Fellow scheme of the Human Resource Development Group (HRDG) of CSIR.  A number of universities have recognized NIO as a centre for doctoral research and about 50 scientists from amongst its staff are at present recognized by these universities as doctoral research guides.  With the establishment of the Academy for Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR's institutions are poised to take major initiatives in advanced education in the country.  NIO's Research Council has recommended that the institute take steps to start a school of oceanography as early as possible to address the problem of shortage of advanced manpower in ocean sciences in the country.  The number of Junior Research Fellows, qualified through NET (i.e., the National Eligibility Test, conducted by CSIR), Senior Research Fellows (selected by HRDG, CSIR) and Project Assistants who are enrolled for Ph.D. in the Institute is now 80. Accommodation to doctoral students is usually provided on the Institute's residential campus.

[[File:Autograph score of part of Act2 (Wolf's Glen) of 'Der Freischütz' - NGO4p1116.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A hand-written [[Sheet music|musical score]] for Act 2 of the [[opera]] ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' by [[Carl Maria von Weber]], written in the 1820s. The score contains all the parts for the singers and the [[accompaniment]] parts and melodies for the [[orchestra]].]]
'''Orchestration''' is the study or practice of writing [[music]] for an [[orchestra]] (or, more loosely, for any [[musical ensemble]], such as a [[concert band]]) or of adapting music composed for another medium for an orchestra. Also called "instrumentation", orchestration is the selection of different instruments to play the different parts (e.g., [[melody]], [[bassline]], etc.) of a musical work. For example, a work for solo piano could be adapted and orchestrated so that an orchestra could perform the piece, or a concert band piece could be orchestrated for a symphony orchestra.

Only gradually over the course of music history did orchestration come to be regarded as a separate compositional art and profession in itself. In [[classical music]], most [[composer]]s write the [[melody|melodies]], [[chord progression]] and [[musical form]] for a piece and, then, if they want the piece to be played by an orchestra, they orchestrate the piece themselves. In [[musical theatre]], however, the composer typically writes the [[melody|melodies]] and then hires a professional [[arranger]] or orchestrator to devise the parts for the [[pit orchestra]] to play.

Similarly, when a film company is making a film score, a composer thinks up the main melodies and themes for the score, and then one or more orchestrators are hired to "flesh out" these basic melodies by adding [[accompaniment]] parts, [[bassline]]s, backing chords, and so on. In jazz [[big band]]s, the composer or [[songwriter]] writes the [[lead sheet]], which contains the melody and the chords, and then one or more orchestrators or arrangers "flesh out" these basic musical ideas by creating parts for the saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and the [[rhythm section]] (bass, piano/[[jazz guitar]]/[[Hammond organ]], drums).

==As profession==
An '''orchestrator''' is a trained musical professional who assigns instruments from an [[orchestra]] or other [[musical ensemble]] to a piece of music written by a [[composer]], or who adapts music composed for another medium for an orchestra. Orchestrators may work for [[musical theatre]] productions, [[film production]] companies or [[recording studio]]s. Some orchestrators teach at colleges, conservatories or universities. The training done by orchestrators varies. Most have completed formal postsecondary education in music, such as a [[Bachelor of Music]] (B.Mus.), [[Master of Music]] (M.Mus.) or an artist's diploma. Orchestrators who teach at universities, colleges and conservatories may be required to hold a master's degree or a Doctorate (the latter may be a Ph.D. or a D.M.A). Orchestrators who work for film companies, musical theatre companies and other organizations may be hired solely based on their orchestration experience, even if they do not hold academic credentials. In the 2010s, as the percentage of faculty holding [[terminal degree]]s and/or Doctoral degrees is part of how an institution is rated, this is causing an increasing number of postsecondary institutions to require terminal and/or Doctoral degrees.

==In practice==
The term ''orchestration'' in its specific sense refers to the way instruments are used to portray any musical aspect such as [[melody]], [[harmony]] or [[rhythm]]. For example, a C [[major chord]] is made up of the notes [[C (musical note)|C]], [[E (musical note)|E]], and [[G (musical note)|G]]. If the notes are held out the entire duration of a [[bar (music)|measure]], the composer or orchestrator will have to decide what instrument(s) play this chord and in what [[Register (music)|register]]. Some instruments, including [[woodwinds]] and [[brass]] are [[Monophony|monophonic]] and can only play one note of the chord at a time. However, in a full orchestra there are more than one of these instruments, so the composer may choose to outline the chord in its basic form with a group of [[clarinets]] or [[trumpets]] (with separate instruments each being given one of the three notes of the chord). Other instruments, including the [[string instrument|strings]], [[piano]], [[harp]], and pitched [[percussion]] are [[polyphonic]] and may play more than one note at a time. As such, if the composer/orchestrator wishes to have the strings play the C major chord, she could assign the low C to the cellos and basses, the G to the violas, and then a high E to the second [[violin]]s and an E an octave higher to the first violins. If the composer/orchestrator wishes the chord to be played only by the first and second violins, she could give the second violins a low C and give the first violins a [[double stop]] of the notes G (an open string) and E.

Additionally in orchestration, notes may be placed into another register (such as transposed down for the [[string bass|basses]]), doubled (both in the same and different octaves), and altered with various levels of dynamics.  The choice of instruments, registers, and dynamics affect the overall [[timbre|tone color]].  If the C major chord was orchestrated for the [[trumpet]]s and [[trombone]]s playing [[fortissimo]] in their upper registers, it would sound very bright; but if the same chord was orchestrated for the [[cello|celli]] and [[string bass]]es playing [[sul tasto]], doubled by the [[bassoon]]s and [[bass clarinet]], it might sound heavy and dark.

Note that although the above example discussed orchestrating a chord, a melody or even a single note may be orchestrated in this fashion. Also note that in this specific sense of the word, ''orchestration'' is not necessarily limited to an orchestra, as a composer may ''orchestrate'' this same C major chord for, say, a [[woodwind quintet]], a [[string quartet]] or a [[concert band]]. Each different ensemble would enable the orchestrator/composer to create different tone "colours" and timbres.

A [[melody]] is also orchestrated. The composer or orchestrator may think of a melody in her head, or while playing the piano or organ. Once she has thought of a melody, she has to decide which instrument (or instruments) will play the melody. One widely used approach for a melody is to assign it to the first violins. When the first violins play a melody, the composer can have the second violins double the melody an octave below, or have the second violins play a harmony part (often in thirds and sixths). Sometimes, for a forceful effect, a composer will indicate in the score that all of the strings (violins, violas, cellos, and double basses) will play the melody in unison, at the same time. Typically, even though the instruments are playing the same note names, the violins will play very high-register notes, the violas and cellos will play lower-register notes, and the double basses will play the deepest, lowest pitches.

As well, the [[woodwinds]] and [[brass instrument]]s can effectively carry a melody, depending on the effect the composer/orchestrator desires. The [[trumpet]]s can perform a melody in a powerful, high register. Alternatively, if the trombones play a melody, the pitch will be lower than the trumpet, and the tone will be heavier, which may change the musical effect that is created. While the [[cello]]s are often given an [[accompaniment]] role in orchestration, there are notable cases where the cellos have been assigned the melody. In even more rare cases, the double bass section (or principal bass) may be given a melody (e.g., the high-register double bass solo in [[Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Lieutenant Kije Suite]]'').

While assigning a melody to a particular section, such as the string section or the woodwinds will work well, as the stringed instruments and all the woodwinds blend together well, some composers give the melody to one section and then have the melody doubled by a different section or an instrument from a different section. For example, a melody played by the first violins could be doubled by the [[glockenspiel]], which would add a sparkling, chime-like colour to the melody. Alternatively, a melody played by the piccolos could be doubled by the [[celesta]], which would add a bright tone to the sound.

In the 20th and 21st century, [[contemporary composer]]s began to incorporate [[music technology (electric)|electric]] and [[music technology (electronic and digital)|electronic]] instruments into the orchestra, such as the [[electric guitar]] played through a [[guitar amplifier]], the [[electric bass]] played through a [[bass amplifier]], the [[Theremin]] and the [[synthesizer]]. The addition of these new instruments gave composers new options for creating tonal "colours" in their orchestration. For example, in the late 20th century and onwards, a composer could have a melody played by the first violins doubled by a futuristic-sounding [[synthesizer]] or a [[theremin]] to create an unusual effect.

Orchestral instrumentation is denoted by an abbreviated formulaic convention,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Orchestral Music a Handbook|last=Daniels|first=David|publisher=Scarecrow Press Inc.|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows: [[flute]], [[oboe]], [[clarinet]], [[bassoon]]- horn, [[trumpet]], [[trombone]], [[tuba]]. More details can be contained in brackets. A dot separates one player from another, a slash indicates doubling. Timpani and percussion are denoted 2Tmp+ number of percussion.

For example, 3[1.2.3/pic] 2[1.Eh] 3[1.2.3/Ebcl/bcl] 3[1.2/cbn.cbn] tmp+2 is interpreted as:

* 3 flautists, the 3rd doubling on piccolo ("doubling" means that the performer can play flute and piccolo)
* 
* 2 oboists, the 2nd playing English horn throughout
* 
* 3 clarinetists, the 3rd doubling also on E-flat clarinet and bass clarinet
* 
* 3 bassoonists, the 2nd doubling on contrabassoon, the 3rd playing only contra

* Timpani+ 2 percussion.

As an example, Mahler Symphony 2 is scored: 4[1/pic.2/pic.3/pic.4/pic] 4[1.2.3/Eh.4/Eh] 5[1.2.3/bcl.4/Ebcl2.Ebcl] 4[1.2.3.4/cbn]- 10 8 4 1- 2tmp+4-2&amp;nbsp;hp- org- str.

==Examples from the repertoire==

===J.S Bach===
During the [[Baroque]] era, composers showed increasing awareness of the expressive potential of orchestration.  While some early Baroque pieces have no indication of which instruments should play the piece, the choice of instruments being left to the musical group's leader or [[concertmaster]], there are Baroque works which specify certain instruments. The orchestral accompaniment to the aria 'et misericordia' from J.S.Bach’s ''[[Magnificat]]'', BWV243 (1723) features muted strings [[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubled]] by flutes, a subtle combination of mellow instrumental [[timbres]].[[File:Et misericordia.png|thumb|center|500px|Orchestral introduction to 'et misericordia' from Bach's Magnificat, BWV 243. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om6FA-8Rs5I Listen]]]

The orchestral introduction to the opening chorus of J.S.Bach’s [[epiphany (holiday)|epiphany]] Cantata [[Sie werden aus Saba alle kommen, BWV 65|''Sie werden aus Saba alle kommen'']] BWV65, which [[John Eliot Gardiner]] (2013, p.&amp;nbsp;328) describes as “one of the crowning glories of Bach’s first Christmas season” demonstrates the composer’s mastery of his craft.  Within a space of eight bars, we hear recorders, [[oboe da caccia|oboes da caccia]], horns and strings creating a “glittery sheen” of contrasted timbres, sonorities and textures ranging from just two horns against a string [[pedal point]] in the first bar to a “restatement of the octave unison theme, this time by all the voices and instruments spread over five octaves” in bars 7-8:&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, J.E. (2013, p. 328) ''Music in the Castle of Heaven''.  London, Allen Lane.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Opening orchestral introduction to J.S. Bach's Cantata, BWV65.wav|thumb|Opening orchestral introduction to J.S. Bach's Cantata, BWV65.]][[File:Sie werden aus Saba Alle kommen opening bars.png|thumb|center|600px|Opening orchestral introduction to J.S. Bach's Cantata, BWV65. ]]

Igor Stravinsky (1959, p45) marvelled at Bach’s skill as an orchestrator: “What incomparable instrumental writing is Bach's. You can smell the resin [(rosin)] in his violin parts, [and] taste the reeds in the 
oboes.”&lt;ref&gt;Stravinsky I. and Craft, R. ''Conversations with Igor Stravinsky''.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rameau===
Jean Philippe [[Rameau]] was famous for "the eloquence of [his] orchestral writing which was something entirely new... - with a feeling for colour [(i.e., tone colour or timbre)] that is altogether 'modern'."&lt;ref&gt;Pincherle, M. (1967, p.122) ''An Illustrated History of Music''.  London, MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt; In 'The Entrance of Polymnie' from his opera ''[[Les Boréades]]'' (1763), the predominant string texture is shot through with descending scale figures on the bassoon, creating an exquisite blend of timbres:[[File:Entry of Polymnie from les Boreades.wav|thumb|'L'Entrée de Polymnie' from ''Les Boréades'' by Rameau.]][[File:Entry of Polymnie from les Boreades.png|thumb|center|500px|'L'Entrée de Polymnie' from ''Les Boréades'' by Rameau.]]

===Mozart===
Another important technique of orchestration was [[call and response (music)|antiphony]], the "call and response" exchange of musical motifs or "ideas" between different groups in the orchestra. In an antiphonal section, the composer may have one group of instruments introduce a melodic idea (e.g., the first violins), and then have the woodwinds "answer" by restating this melodic idea, often with some type of variation. In the trio section of the minuet from Mozart’s [[Symphony No. 41 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 41]] (1788), the flute, bassoons and horn exchange phrases with the strings, with the first violin line [[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubled]] at the [[octave]] by the first oboe:[[File:Mozart Jupiter Symphony Trio.wav|thumb|Trio section of the Minuet from Mozart's Symphony No. 41.]] [[File:Mozart Jupiter Trio.png|thumb|center|500px|Trio section of the Minuet from Mozart's Symphony No. 41. ]] Charles Rosen (1971, p.&amp;nbsp;240) admires Mozart’s skill in orchestrating his piano concertos, particularly the [[Piano Concerto No. 22 (Mozart)|Concerto in E flat major, K482]], a work that introduced clarinets into the mix.  “This concerto places the greatest musical reliance on tone colour, which is, indeed, almost always ravishing.  One lovely example of its sonorities comes near the beginning.” &lt;ref&gt;Rosen, C. (1971, p240) The Classical Style.  London Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Mozart Piano Concerto 22 first movement opening.wav|thumb|Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars  1-12]][[File:Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars 1-6.png|thumb|center|500px|Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars 1-6]] 
 
The orchestral [[tutti]] in the first two bars is answered by just horns and bassoon in bars 2-6.  This passage repeats with fresh orchestration: [[File:Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars 7-12.png|thumb|center|500px|Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars 7-12. ]]“Here we have the unusual sound on the violins providing the bass for the solo clarinets.  The simplicity of the sequence concentrates all our interest on tone-colour, and what follows – a series of woodwind solos – keeps it there.  The orchestration throughout, in fact, has a greater variety than Mozart had wished or needed before, and fits the brilliance, charm, and grace of the first movement and the finale.” &lt;ref&gt;Rosen, C. (1971, p240) The Classical Style.  London Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beethoven===
A demonstration of Beethoven’s consummate skill at obtaining the maximum variety out of seemingly unprepossessing and fairly simple material can be found in the first movement of the [[Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 5|Piano Concerto No. 5]] in E flat (‘The Emperor’) Opus 73 (1810). The [[sonata form|second subject of the sonata form]] is a deceptively simple tune that, according to Fiske (1970, p.&amp;nbsp;41) “is limited to notes playable on the horns for which it music have been specially designed.”&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, R. (1970), ''Beethoven Concertos and Overtures''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; This theme appears in five different orchestrations throughout the movement, with changes of [[Mode (music)|mode]] (major to minor), [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] ([[forte (music)|forte]] to [[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]]) and a blending of instrumental [[Timbre|colour]] that ranges from boldly stated [[tutti]] passages to the most subtle and differentiated episodes, where instrumental sounds are combined often in quite unexpected ways:[[File:Second subject theme from the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 (Emperor).wav|thumb|Second subject theme from the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 (Emperor)]][[File:Subsidiary theme from the first movement of beethoven's Piano Conxcert No. 5 (Emperor).png|thumb|center|600px|Second subject theme from the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 (Emperor)]]

The theme first appears in the minor mode during the orchestral introduction, performed using [[staccato]] articulation and orchestrated in the most delicate and enchanting colours:[[File:Minor version of the theme.wav|thumb|Minor version of the theme]][[File:Minor version 1.png|thumb|center|500px|Minor version of the theme. ]]This is followed by a more straightforward version in the major key, with horns accompanied by strings.  The theme is now played [[legato]] by the horns, accompanied by a sustained [[pedal point]] in the bassoons.  The violins simultaneously play an elaborated version of the theme.  (See also [[heterophony]].)  The timpani and [[pizzicato]] lower strings add further colour to this variegated palette of sounds. “Considering that the notes are virtually the same the difference in effect is extraordinary”:&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, R. (1970, p.41), ''Beethoven Concertos and Overtures''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Major version of the theme, with horns playing the melody.wav|thumb|Major version of the theme, with horns playing the melody]][[File:Major version of the theme.png|thumb|center|500px|Major version of the theme, with horns playing the melody. ]]When the solo piano enters, its right hand plays a variant of the minor version of the theme in a [[Tuplet|triplet]] rhythm, with the backing of pizzicato (plucked) strings on the off-beats:[[File:Minor version of the theme, with piano right hand elaborating the melody in triplets.wav|thumb|Minor version of the theme, with piano right hand elaborating the melody in triplets]][[File:Minor version 2 - piano.png|thumb|center|500px|Minor key version of the theme, with piano right hand elaborating the melody in triplets. ]]This is followed by a bold [[Tutti|''tutti'']] statement of the theme, "with the whole orchestra thumping it out in aggressive semi-[[staccato]].&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, R. (1970, p.42), ''Beethoven Concertos and Overtures''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Tutti statement of the theme.wav|thumb|Tutti statement of the theme]]:[[File:Tutti version in major.png|thumb|center|500px|Tutti statement of the theme. ]]The minor version of the theme also appears in the [[cadenza]], played staccato by the solo piano:[[File:Solo piano statement of theme in the cadenza.wav|thumb|Solo piano statement of theme in the cadenza]][[File:Cadenza.png|thumb|center|500px|Solo piano statement of theme in the cadenza. ]]This is followed, finally, by a restatement of the major key version, featuring horns playing legato , accompanied by pizzicato strings and [[filigree]] arpeggio figuration in the solo piano:[[File:Final statement of the theme in a major key by the horns after the end of the cadenza.wav|thumb|Final statement of the theme in a major key by the horns after the end of the cadenza]][[File:Major version in cadenza.png|thumb|center|500px|Final statement of the theme in a major key by the horns after the end of the cadenza. ]] Fiske (1970) says that Beethoven shows “a superb flood of invention” through these varied treatments.  “The variety of moods this theme can convey is without limit” .”&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, R. (1970, p.42), ''Beethoven Concertos and Overtures''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berlioz===

The most significant orchestral innovator of the early 19th century was Hector [[Berlioz]].  (The composer was also the author of a ''[[Treatise on Instrumentation]]''.) “He was drawn to the orchestra as his chosen medium by instinct … and by finding out the exact capabilities and [[timbres]] of individual instruments, and it was on this raw material that his imagination worked to produce countless new sonorities, very striking when considered as a totality, crucially instructive for later composers, and nearly all exactly tailored to their dramatic or expressive purpose.” &lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, H. (1969, p5) ''Berlioz Orchestral Music''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous examples of Berlioz’s orchestral wizardry and his penchant for conjuring extraordinary sonorities can be found in his ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]''.  The opening of the fourth movement, entitled “March to the Scaffold” features what for the time (1830) must have seemed a bizarre mix of sounds.  The timpani and the double basses play thick chords against the snarling muted brass: [[File:March to the Scaffold bars 1-4.png|thumb|center|500px|Berlioz, March to the Scaffold from the Symphonie [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXHrHQ5ZEHo Fantastique. Listen]]]

“Although he derives from Beethoven, Berlioz uses features that run counter to the rules of composition in general, such as the chords in close position in the low register of the double basses.” &lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (203, p.44) Boulez on Conducting.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;
Berlioz was also capable of conveying great delicacy in his instrumental writing.  A particularly spectacular instance is the “[[Queen Mab]]” [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsf7Jmj7HM scherzo] from the ''[[Romeo et Juliette]]'' symphony, which [[Hugh Macdonald]] (1969, p51) describes as “Berlioz’s supreme exercise in light orchestral texture, a brilliant, gossamer fabric, [[prestissimo]] and [[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]] almost without pause: [[File:Queen Mab main theme.png|thumb|center|500px|Berlioz, Queen Mab scherzo from Romeo et Juliette]]

Boulez points out that the very fast tempo must have made unprecedented demands on conductors and orchestras of the time (1830), “Because of the rapid and precise rhythms, the staccatos which must be even and regular in all registers, because of the isolated notes that occur right at the end of the bar on the third quaver…all of which must fall into place with absolutely perfect precision.” &lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (203, p.37) Boulez on Conducting.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;
Macdonald highlights the passage towards the end of the scherzo where “The sounds become more ethereal and fairylike, low clarinet, high harps and the bell-like antique cymbals…The pace and fascination of the movement are irresistible; it is some of the most ethereally brilliant music ever penned.” &lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, H. (1969, p51) Berlioz orchestral Music.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Queen mab scherzo p218.png|thumb|center|500px|Berlioz, orchestral texture from  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsf7Jmj7HM&amp;t=6m0s Queen Mab Scherzo. Listen]]] The [[New Grove Dictionary]] says that for Berlioz, orchestration “was intrinsic to composition, not something applied to finished music...in his hands [[timbre]] became something that could be used in free combinations, as an artist might use his palette, without bowing to the demands of line, and this leads to the rich orchestral resource of Debussy and Ravel.”&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, H., (2001) “Berlioz”, article in Sadie, S. (ed.) ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition.  London, MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wagner===

After Berlioz, [[Richard Wagner]] was the major pioneer in the development of orchestration during the 19th century.  [[Pierre Boulez]] speaks of the “sheer richness of Wagner’s orchestration and his irrepressible instinct for innovation.”&lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (1986, p273) Orientations.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Latham says that Wagner had a “unique appreciation of the possibilities for colour inherent in the instruments at his disposal, and it was this that guided him both in his selection of new recruits for the orchestral family and in his treatment of its established members. The well-known division of that family into strings, woodwind, and brass, with percussion as required, he inherited from the great classical symphonists such changes as he made were in the direction of splitting up these groups still further.” Latham gives as an example, the sonority of the opening of the opera ''[[Lohengrin]]'', where “the ethereal quality of the music” is due to the violins being “divided up into four, five, or even eight parts instead of the customary two.”&lt;ref&gt;Latham, P. (1926) “Wagner: Aesthetics and Orchestration.” Gramophone, June 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Prelude to Lohengrin condensed score.png|thumb|center|500px|Wagner, Prelude to Lohengrin [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqk4bcnBqls Listen]]]

As he matured as a composer, particularly through his experience of composing [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|''The Ring'']] Wagner made “increasing use of the contrast between pure and mixed [[Timbre|colours]], bringing to a fine point the art of transition from one field of sonority to another.” &lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (1986, p273) Orientations.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first act of his final opera ''[[Parsifal]]'', Wagner offsets the bold brass with gentler strings, showing that the same musical material feels very different when passed between contrasting families of instruments:[[File:Parsifal contrasting groups.png|thumb|center|500px|Contrasting orchestral groups from the first Act of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04Q-dl2RYyA&amp;t=0m54s Parsifal]]]

On the other hand, the prelude to the opera ''[[Tristan and Isolde]]'' exemplifies the variety that Wagner could extract through combining instruments from different [[Orchestra|orchestral families]] with his precise markings of [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] and [[Articulation (music)|articulation]].  In the opening phrase, the cellos are supported by wind instruments: [[File:Tristan prelude bars 1-7.png|thumb|center|500px|Wagner, Tristan prelude, opening. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-qoaioG2UA&amp;list=RDJ-qoaioG2UA Listen]]]

When this idea returns towards the end of the prelude, the [[Timbre|instrumental colors]] are varied subtly, with sounds that were new to the 19th century orchestra, such as the [[cor anglais]] and the [[bass clarinet]].  These, together with the ominous rumbling of the timpani effectively convey the brooding atmosphere: [[File:Wagner, Tristan prelude closing bars.png|thumb|center|500px|Wagner, Tristan Prelude, closing bars. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-qoaioG2UA&amp;list=RDJ-qoaioG2UA&amp;t=9m45s Link to passage]]]

“It’s impressive to see how Wagner… produces balance in his works.  He is true genius in this respect, undeniably so, even down to the working out of the exact number of instruments.”  Boulez is “fascinated by the precision with which Wagner gauges orchestral balance, [which] … contains a multiplicity of details that he achieved with astonishing precision.”&lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (2003, p.52) Boulez on Conducting.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Roger Scruton]], "Seldom since Bach's inspired use of [[obbligato]] parts in his cantatas have the instruments of the orchestra been so meticulously and lovingly adapted to their expressive role by Wagner in his later operas." &lt;ref&gt;Scruton, R. (2016, p147) ''The Ring of Truth: The Wisdom of Wagner's'' Ring of the Nibelung.  Penguin Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahler===
William Austin (1966) says “[[Mahler]] expanded the orchestra, going ahead to a historic climax in the direction already marked by [[Beethoven]], [[Berlioz]] and [[Wagner]]… The purpose of this famous expansion was not a sheer increase in volume, but a greater variety of sound with more nearly continuous gradations… Mahler only occasionally required all his vast orchestra to play together, and his music was as often soft as loud.  Its colours were continually shifting, blending or contrasting with each other.”&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p. 123) ''Music in the 20th Century''.  London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adorno]] (1971) similarly describes Mahler’s symphonic writing as characterised by “massive tutti effects” contrasted with “chamber-music procedures”.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, T.W. (1971, p.53) ''Mahler, a musical physiognomy''.  Trans. Jephcott.  University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The following passage from the first movement of his Symphony No. 4 illustrates this:[[File:Mahler 4 1st movt Fig 5.wav|thumb|Mahler, Symphony No. 4, first movement, Fig 5]][[File:Mahler 4 1st movt Fig 5.png|thumb|center|500px|Mahler, Symphony No. 4, first movement, Figure 5. ]] Only in the first bar of the above is there a full ensemble.  The remaining bars feature highly differentiated small groups of instruments.  Mahler’s experienced conductor’s ear led him to write detailed performance markings in his scores, including carefully calibrated dynamics.  For example, in bar 2 above, the low harp note is marked [[Dynamics (music)|''forte'']], the clarinets, [[Dynamics (music)|''mezzo-forte'']] and the horns [[Dynamics (music)|''piano'']].  Austin (1966) says that “Mahler cared about the finest nuances of loudness and tempo and worked tirelessly to fix these details in his scores.”&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p. 123) ''Music in the 20th Century''.  London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahler’s imagination for sonority is exemplified in the closing bars of the slow movement of the Fourth Symphony, where there occurs what [[Walter Piston]] (1969, p.&amp;nbsp;140) describes as “an instance of inspired orchestration… To be noted are the sudden change of mode in the harmonic progression, the unusual spacing of the chord in measure 5, and the placing of the perfect fourth in the two flutes. The effect is quite unexpected and magical.”&lt;ref&gt;Piston, W. (1969) ''Orchestration''.  London, Victor Gollancz.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Mahler 4 3rd movement Fig 13.wav|thumb|Mahler Symphony No 4, third movement, Figure 13.]][[File:Mahler 4 third movement.png|thumb|center|500px|Mahler Symphony No 4, third movement, Figure 13.]]

===Debussy===

Apart from Mahler and [[Richard Strauss]], the major innovator in orchestration during the closing years of the nineteenth and the first decades of the twentieth century was Claude [[Debussy]].  According to Pierre [[Boulez]] (1975, p20) “Debussy’s orchestration… when compared with even such brilliant contemporaries as Strauss and Mahler… shows an infinitely fresher imagination.”  Boulez said that Debussy’s orchestration was “conceived from quite a different point of view; the number of instruments, their balance, the order in which they are used, their use itself, produces a different climate.”  Apart from the early impact of [[Wagner]], Debussy was also fascinated by music from Asia that according to Austin “he heard repeatedly and admired intensely at the Paris World exhibition of 1889”.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p20) ''Music in the 20th century''. London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both influences inform Debussy’s first major orchestral work, ''[[Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune|Prelude a l’après-midi d’un faune]]'' (1894).  Wagner’s influence can be heard in the strategic use of [[silence]], the sensitively differentiated orchestration and, above all in the striking [[half-diminished seventh]] chord spread between oboes and clarinets, reinforced by a [[glissando]] on the harp. Austin (1966, p.&amp;nbsp;16) continues “Only a composer thoroughly familiar with the [[Tristan chord]] could have conceived the beginning of the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYyK922PsUw ''Faune''].”&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p.16) ''Music in the 20th century''.  London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Prelude a l'apres midi opening.png|thumb|center|600px|Debussy, Prelude a l'apres midi d'un faune, opening bars]]

Later in the ''Faune'', Debussy builds a complex texture, where, as Austin says, “[[Polyphony]] and orchestration overlap...He adds to all the devices of [[Mozart]], [[Weber]], [[Berlioz]] and Wagner the possibilities that he learned from the [[heterophonic]] music of the Far East.... The first harp varies the flute parts in almost the same way that the smallest bells of a [[Java]]nese [[gamelan]] vary the slower basic melody.”&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p.20) ''Music in the 20th century''.  London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Prelude a l'apres midi, from Fig 7- short score version.png|thumb|center|700px|Debussy, Prelude a l'apres midi d'un faune, Figure 7, bars 11-13]]

Debussy’s final orchestral work, the enigmatic ballet ''[[Jeux]]'' (1913) was composed nearly 20 years after the ''Faune''.  The opening bars feature divided strings, spread over a wide range, a harp doubling horns with the addition of the bell-like [[celesta]] in the 5th bar and the sultry voicing of the [[whole tone scale|whole tone]] chords in the woodwind:[[File:Jeux opening bars.png|thumb|center|500px|Debussy, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8qP_2i3HYA Jeux opening bars]]]

Jensen (2014, p.&amp;nbsp;228) says “Perhaps the greatest marvel of ''Jeux'' is its orchestration.  While working on the piano score, Debussy wrote: ‘I am thinking of that orchestral colour which seems to be illuminated from behind, and for which there are such marvellous displays in ''[[Parsifal]]''’  The idea, then, was to produce timbre without glare, subdued… but to do so with clarity and precision.” &lt;ref&gt;Jensen, E.F. (2014) ''Debussy''.  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As adaptation==
In a more general sense, ''orchestration'' also refers to the re-adaptation of existing music into another medium, particularly a full or reduced orchestra. There are two general kinds of adaptation: [[Transcription (music)|transcription]], which closely follows the original piece,  and [[arrangement]], which tends to change significant aspects of the original piece. In terms of adaptation, ''orchestration'' applies, strictly speaking, only to writing for orchestra, whereas the term ''[[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]]'' applies to instruments used in the texture of the piece. In the study of orchestration&amp;nbsp;– in contradistinction to the practice&amp;nbsp;– the term ''instrumentation'' may also refer to consideration of the defining characteristics of individual instruments rather than to the art of combining instruments.

In commercial music, especially musical theatre and film music, independent orchestrators are often used because it is difficult to meet tight deadlines when the same person is required both to compose and to orchestrate. Frequently, when a stage musical is adapted to film, such as ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' or ''[[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|Fiddler on the Roof]]'', the orchestrations for the film version are notably different from the stage ones. In other cases, such as ''[[Evita (1996 film)|Evita]]'', they are not, and are simply expanded versions from those used in the stage production.

Most orchestrators often work from a draft (sketch), or [[Sheet music#Types|short score]], that is, a score written on limited number of independent [[musical staff|musical staves]]. Some orchestrators, particularly those writing for the [[opera]] or [[music theatre]]s, prefer to work from a piano [[vocal score]] up, since the singers need to start rehearsing a piece long before the whole work is fully completed. That was, for instance, the method of composition of [[Jules Massenet]]. In other instances, simple cooperation between various creators is utilized, as when [[Jonathan Tunick]] orchestrates [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s songs, or when orchestration is done from a [[lead sheet]] (a simplified music notation for a song which includes just the melody and the [[chord progression]]). In the latter case, arranging as well as orchestration will be involved.

==Film orchestration==
Due to the enormous time constraints of film scoring schedules, most film composers employ orchestrators rather than doing the work themselves, although these orchestrators work under the close supervision of the composer. Some [[Film score|film composers]] have made the time to orchestrate their own music, including [[Bernard Herrmann]] (1911-1975), [[Georges Delerue]] (1925-1992), [[Ennio Morricone]] (1928-), [[John Williams]] (1932-) (his very detailed sketches are 99% orchestrated), [[Howard Shore]] (1946-), [[James Horner]] (1953-2015) (on Braveheart), [[Bruno Coulais]] (1954-), [[Rachel Portman]] (1960-), [[Philippe Rombi]] (1968-) and [[Abel Korzeniowski]] (1972-).

Although there have been hundreds of orchestrators in film over the years, the most prominent film orchestrators for the latter half of the 20th century were [[Jack Hayes (composer)|Jack Hayes]], [[Herbert W. Spencer]], [[Edward B. Powell (orchestrator)|Edward Powell]] (who worked almost exclusively with [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]]), [[Arthur Morton (composer)|Arthur Morton]], Greig McRitchie, and [[Alexander Courage]].  Some of the most in-demand orchestrators today (and of the past 30 years) include [[Jeff Atmajian]], [[Pete Anthony]], [[Brad Dechter]] (James Newton Howard, Christopher Young, Theodore Shapiro, Teddy Castellucci, Danny Elfman, John Powell, Marco Beltrami, John Debney, Marc Shaiman, Michael Giacchino), [[Conrad Pope]] (John Williams, Alexandre Desplat, Jerry Goldsmith, James Newton Howard, Alan Silvestri, James Horner, Mark Isham, John Powell, Michael Convertino, Danny Elfman, Howard Shore), [[Eddie Karam]] (John Williams, James Horner), [[Bruce Fowler]] (Hans Zimmer, Klaus Badelt, Harry Gregson-Williams, Steve Jablonsky, Mark Mothersbaugh, John Powell), [[John Ashton Thomas]] (John Powell, John Debney, Alan Silvestri, James Newton Howard, Henry Jackman, Lyle Workman, Theodore Shapiro, John Ottman, John Paesano), [[Robert Elhai]] (Elliot Goldenthal, Michael Kamen, Ed Shearmur, Brian Tyler, Klaus Badelt, Ilan Eshkeri ) and [[J.A.C. Redford]] (James Horner, Thomas Newman). 

[[Conrad Salinger]] was the most prominent orchestrator of MGM musicals from the 1940s to 1962, orchestrating such famous films as ''[[Singin' in the Rain (film)|Singin' in the Rain]]'', ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'', and ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]''. In the 1950s, film composer [[John Williams]] frequently spent time with Salinger informally learning the craft of orchestration. [[Robert Russell Bennett]] (George Gershwin, Rodgers and Hammerstein) was one of America's most prolific orchestrators (particularly of Broadway shows) of the 20th century, sometimes scoring over 80 pages a day.

===Process===
Most films require 30 to 120 minutes of musical score. Each individual piece of music in a film is called a "cue". There are roughly 20-80 cues per film. A dramatic film may require slow and sparse music while an action film may require 80 cues of highly active music. Each cue can range in length from five seconds to more than ten minutes as needed per scene in the film. After the composer is finished composing the cue, this sketch score is delivered to the orchestrator either as hand written or computer generated. Most composers in Hollywood today compose their music using sequencing software (e.g. [[Digital Performer]], [[Logic Pro]], or [[Cubase]]). A sketch score can be generated through the use of a [[MIDI]] file which is then imported into a [[scorewriter|music notation program]] such as [[Finale (software)|Finale]] or [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]]. Thus begins the job of the orchestrator.

Every composer works differently and the orchestrator's job is to understand what is required from one composer to the next. If the music is created with sequencing software then the orchestrator is given a MIDI sketch score and a synthesized recording of the cue. The sketch score only contains the musical notes (e.g. eighth notes, quarter notes, etc.) with no phrasing, articulations, or dynamics. The orchestrator studies this synthesized "mockup" recording listening to dynamics and phrasing (just as the composer has played them in).  He or she then accurately tries to represent these elements in the orchestra. However some voicings on a synthesizer ([[synthestration]]) will not work in the same way when orchestrated for the live orchestra.

The sound samples are often doubled up very prominently and thickly with other sounds in order to get the music to "speak" louder. The orchestrator sometimes changes these synth voicings to traditional orchestral voicings in order to make the music flow better. He or she may move intervals up or down the octave (or omit them entirely), double certain passages with other instruments in the orchestra, add percussion instruments to provide colour, and add Italian performance marks (e.g. Allegro con brio, Adagio, ritardando, dolce, staccato, etc.). If a composer writes a large action cue, and no woodwinds are used, the orchestrator will often add woodwinds by doubling the brass music up an octave. The orchestra size is determined from the music budget of the film.

The orchestrator is told in advance the number of instruments he or she has to work with and has to abide by what is available. A big-budget film may be able to afford a [[Romantic music era]]-orchestra with over 100 musicians. In contrast, a low-budget [[independent film]] may only be able to afford a 20 performer [[chamber orchestra]] or a [[jazz quartet]]. Sometimes a composer will write a three-part chord for three flutes, although only two flutes have been hired. The orchestrator decides where to put the third note. For example, the orchestrator could have the clarinet (a woodwind that blends well with flute) play the third note. After the orchestrated cue is complete it is delivered to the copying house (generally by placing it on a computer server) so that each instrument of the orchestra can be electronically extracted, printed, and delivered to the scoring stage.

The major film composers in Hollywood each have a lead orchestrator. Generally the lead orchestrator attempts to orchestrate as much of the music as possible if time allows. If the schedule is too demanding, a team of orchestrators (ranging from two to eight) will work on a film. The lead orchestrator decides on the assignment of cues to other orchestrators on the team. Most films can be orchestrated in one to two weeks with a team of five orchestrators. New orchestrators trying to obtain work will often approach a film composer asking to be hired. They are generally referred to the lead orchestrator for consideration. At the scoring stage the orchestrator will often assist the composer in the recording booth giving suggestions on how to improve the performance, the music, or the recording. If the composer is conducting, sometimes the orchestrator will remain in the recording booth to assist as a producer. Sometimes the roles are reversed with the orchestrator [[conducting]] and the composer producing from the booth.

'''Orthosilicic acid''' is the [[chemical compound]] with formula {{chem|Si(|OH|)|4}}. It is assumed to be present in dilute solutions of [[silicon dioxide]] (silica) {{chem|SiO|2}} in water. It can be synthesized in [[non-aqueous solution]]s.

==Introduction==
The term "silicic acid" has traditionally been used as a [[synonym]] for [[silicon dioxide]], SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, also known as "silica". Strictly speaking, silica is the [[anhydride]] of orthosilicic acid, Si(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, from which it can be obtained by a [[dehydration reaction]]. 
:Si(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↓ + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The solubility of silica in pure water is about 1.5mM, or less, depending on the solid state structure of the compound. Because the concentration of orthosilicic acid is so low, it has not been fully characterized. It has been predicted to be "a very weak acid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pauling |first1=Linus |title=The nature of the chemical bond |date=1960 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaka, New York |page=557 |edition=3rd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; More concentrated solutions of orthosilicic acid are unstable and turn into [[silica gel]] and other species.&lt;ref name=gye/&gt;

The situation changed in 2017, when the orthosilicic acid monomer was obtained by [[hydrogenolysis]] of tetrakis(benzoyloxy)silane, (Si(OCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, in solution in [[dimethylacetamide]] or related solvents. The crystal structure of this compound  was determined by [[X-ray crystallography]]. [[Neutron diffraction]] was also used to determine the location of the hydrogen atoms. Di-silicic acid was synthesized by hydrogenation of its hexa-benzoyloxy derivative, R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-SiOSi-R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, R=CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O. Cyclic trisilicic acid, Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and cyclic tetrasilicic acid, Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; were synthesized by variations of this method.&lt;ref name=synthesis&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Igarashi |first1=Masayasu |last2=Matsumoto |first2=Tomohiro |last3=Yagahashi |first3=Fujio |last4=Yamashita |first4=Hiroshi |last5=Ohhara |first5=Takashi |last6=Hanashima |first6=Takayasu |last7=Nakao |first7=Akiko |last8=Moyosh |first8=Taketo |last9=Sato |first9=Kazuhiko |last10=Shimada |first10=Shigeru |title=Non-aqueous selective synthesis of orthosilicic acid and its oligomers |journal=Nature Communications |date=2017 |volume=8  |issue=1 |pages=140 |doi=10.1038/s41467-017-00168-5|pmid=28747652|pmc=5529440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With these new discoveries, the term ''silicic acid'' has become ambiguous: it has been applied traditionally as a synonym for silica, SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but it can now also be used for the compound Si(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The traditional meaning is retained in this article when it was used as such in a cited publication.

==Plants and animals==
Outside the marine environment compounds of silicon have very little biological function. Small quantities of silica are absorbed from the soil by some plants, to be then excreted in the form of [[phytolith]]s.&lt;ref name=snyder&gt;G.H.Snyder (2001): "Methods for silicon analysis in plants, soils, and fertilizers". ''Studies in Plant Science'', volume 8, chapter 11, Pages 185-196 {{doi|10.1016/S0928-3420(01)80015-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subcutaneous injections of orthosilicic acid solutions (around 1%) in [[mice]] were found to cause local [[inflammation]] and [[edema]].  [[peritoneum|Peritoneal]] injections of 0.1 [[milliliter|mL]] of freshly prepared acid were often lethal. The toxicity decreased markedly as the solution aged, to the point that after the solution turned to a gel it had no effects other than mechanical ones.  The solutions were equally toxic when administed by [[intravenous injection]], but seasoned or gelled solutions were about as toxic as fresh ones.&lt;ref  name=gye&gt;W. E. Gye and W. J. Purdy (1922): "The Poisonous Properties of Colloidal Silica. I: The Effects of the Parenteral Administration of Large Doses" ''British Journal of Experimental Pathology'', volume 3, issue 2, pages 75–85. {{PMC|2047780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research concerning the correlation of [[aluminium]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]] has included the ability of silicic acid in beer to reduce aluminium uptake in the digestive system as well as to increase renal excretion of aluminium &lt;ref name="pmid16988476"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Exley C, Korchazhkina O, Job D, Strekopytov S, Polwart A, Crome P |title=Non-invasive therapy to reduce the body burden of aluminium in Alzheimer's disease |journal=J.

''Dissolved silica'' (DSi) is a term used in the field of oceanography to describe the form of water-soluble [[silica]], which is assumed to be {{chem|Si(OH)|4}} (orthoslicic acid) or its conjugate bases (orthosilicate anions) such as {{chem|Si(OH)|3|O|-}} and {{chem|Si(OH)|2|O|2|2-}}. Theoretical computations indicate that the dissolution of silica in water proceeds through the formation of a {{chem|SiO|2}}·2{{chem|H|2|O}} complex and then orthosilicic acid.&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskar Mondal, Deepanwita Ghosh, and Abhijit K.

In the uppermost water column the surface [[ocean]] is undersaturated with respect to dissolved silica, except for the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] south of 55°S.

{{Millennium Problems}}

The '''P versus NP problem''' is a major [[List of unsolved problems in computer science|unsolved problem in computer science]]. It asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified (technically, verified in [[polynomial time]]) can also be solved quickly (again, in polynomial time).

The underlying issues were first discussed in the 1950s, in letters from [[John Forbes Nash Jr.]] to the [[National Security Agency]], and from [[Kurt Gödel]] to [[John von Neumann]]. The precise statement of the '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem was introduced in 1971 by [[Stephen Cook]] in his seminal paper "The complexity of theorem proving procedures"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cook|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Cook|year=1971|chapter=The complexity of theorem proving procedures|chapterurl=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;id=805047|title=Proceedings of the Third Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing|pages=151–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and independently by [[Leonid Levin]] in 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = L. A.

The informal term ''quickly'', used above, means the existence of an algorithm solving the task that runs in [[polynomial time]], such that the time to complete the task varies as a polynomial function on the size of the input to the algorithm (as opposed to, say, [[exponential time]]). The general class of questions for which some algorithm can provide an answer in polynomial time is called "class '''P'''" or just "'''[[P (complexity)|P]]'''". For some questions, there is no known way to find an answer quickly, but if one is provided with information showing what the answer is, it is possible to verify the answer quickly. The class of questions for which an answer can be ''verified'' in polynomial time is called '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''', which stands for "nondeterministic polynomial time".&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;A nondeterministic [[Turing machine]] can move to a state that is not determined by the previous state. Such a machine could solve an '''NP''' problem in polynomial time by falling into the correct answer state (by luck), then conventionally verifying it. Such machines are not practical for solving realistic problems but can be used as theoretical models.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider [[Sudoku]], a game where the player is given a partially filled-in grid of numbers and attempts to complete the grid following certain rules. Given an incomplete Sudoku grid, of any size, is there at least one legal solution?  Any proposed solution is easily verified, and the time to check a solution grows slowly (polynomially) as the grid gets bigger.  However, all known algorithms for finding solutions take, for difficult examples, time that grows exponentially as the grid gets bigger.  So, Sudoku is in '''NP''' (quickly checkable) but does not seem to be in '''P''' (quickly solvable).  Thousands of other problems seem similar, in that they are fast to check but slow to solve.  Researchers have shown that many of the problems in '''NP''' have the extra property that a fast solution to any one of them could be used to build a quick solution to any other problem in '''NP''', a property called [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-completeness]].  Decades of searching have not yielded a fast solution to any of these problems, so most scientists suspect that none of these problems can be solved quickly.  This, however, has never been proven.

An answer to the '''P'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''NP''' question would determine whether problems that can be verified in polynomial time, like Sudoku, can also be solved in polynomial time. If it turned out that '''P'''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;'''NP''', it would mean that there are problems in '''NP'''  that are harder to compute than to verify: they could not be solved in polynomial time, but the answer could be verified in polynomial time.

Aside from being an important problem in computational theory, a proof either way would have profound implications for mathematics, cryptography, algorithm research, [[artificial intelligence]], [[game theory]], multimedia processing, [[philosophy]], [[economics]] and many other fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Golden Ticket: P, NP, and the Search for the Impossible|last=Fortnow|first=Lance|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780691156491|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although the '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem was formally defined in 1971, there were previous inklings of the problems involved, the difficulty of proof, and the potential consequences.  In 1955, mathematician John Nash wrote a letter to the NSA, where he speculated that cracking a sufficiently complex code would require time exponential in the length of the key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letters from John Nash |url=https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/news-features/declassified-documents/nash-letters/nash_letters1.pdf |author=NSA |year=2012}} &lt;/ref&gt;  If proved (and Nash was suitably skeptical) this would imply what is now called '''P'''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;'''NP''', since a proposed key can easily be verified in polynomial time. Another mention of the underlying problem occurred in a 1956 letter written by [[Kurt Gödel]] to [[John von Neumann]].  Gödel asked whether theorem-proving (now known to be [[co-NP-complete|'''co-NP'''-complete]]) could be solved in [[quadratic time|quadratic]] or [[linear time]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hartmanis | first1 = Juris | year = | title = Gödel, von Neumann, and the '''P''' = '''NP''' problem | url = http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/6910/1/89-994.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Bulletin of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 101–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and pointed out one of the most important consequences—that if so, then the discovery of mathematical proofs could be automated.

==Context==
The relation between the [[complexity class]]es '''P''' and '''NP''' is studied in [[computational complexity theory]], the part of the [[theory of computation]] dealing with the resources required during computation to solve a given problem. The most common resources are time (how many steps it takes to solve a problem) and space (how much memory it takes to solve a problem).

In such analysis, a model of the computer for which time must be analyzed is required. Typically such models assume that the computer is ''[[Deterministic computation|deterministic]]'' (given the computer's present state and any inputs, there is only one possible action that the computer might take) and ''sequential'' (it performs actions one after the other).

In this theory, the class '''P''' consists of all those ''[[decision problem]]s'' (defined [[#Formal definitions|below]]) that can be solved on a deterministic sequential machine in an amount of time that is [[polynomial]] in the size of the input; the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' consists of all those decision problems whose positive solutions can be verified in [[polynomial time]] given the right information, or equivalently, whose solution can be found in polynomial time on a [[Non-deterministic Turing machine|non-deterministic]] machine.&lt;ref&gt;Sipser, Michael: ''Introduction to the Theory of Computation, Second Edition, International Edition'', page 270. Thomson Course Technology, 2006. Definition 7.19 and Theorem 7.20.&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly, '''P''' ⊆ '''NP'''. Arguably the biggest open question in [[theoretical computer science]] concerns the relationship between those two classes:
:Is '''P''' equal to '''NP'''?
In a 2002 poll of 100 researchers, 61 believed the answer to be no, 9 believed the answer is yes, and 22 were unsure; 8 believed the question may be [[independent (mathematical logic)|independent]] of the currently accepted axioms and therefore impossible to prove or disprove.&lt;ref name="poll"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=William I. Gasarch| author1-link=William Gasarch | title=The '''P'''=?'''NP''' poll.|journal=[[SIGACT News]]|volume=33|issue=2|pages=34–47|date=June 2002| url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/papers/poll.pdf|doi=10.1145/564585.564599|format=PDF|accessdate=26 September 2018| citeseerx=10.1.1.172.1005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, 10 years later, the same poll was repeated. The number of researchers who answered was 151: 126 (83%) believed the answer to be no, 12 (9%) believed the answer is yes, 5 (3%) believed the question may be [[independent (mathematical logic)|independent]] of the currently accepted axioms and therefore impossible to prove or disprove, 8 (5%) said either don't know or don't care or don't want the answer to be yes nor the problem to be resolved.&lt;ref name="poll2"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=William I.

==NP-completeness==
[[File:P np np-complete np-hard.svg|thumb|300px|right|[[Euler diagram]] for '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''', '''NP'''-complete, and '''NP'''-hard set of problems (excluding the empty language and its complement, which belong to '''P''' but are not '''NP'''-complete)]]
{{Main article|NP-completeness}}
To attack the '''P''' = '''NP''' question, the concept of '''NP'''-completeness is very useful. '''NP'''-complete problems are a set of problems to each of which any other '''NP'''-problem can be reduced in polynomial time, and whose solution may still be verified in polynomial time. That is, any '''NP''' problem can be transformed into any of the '''NP'''-complete problems. Informally, an '''NP'''-complete problem is an '''NP '''problem that is at least as "tough" as any other problem in '''NP'''.

[[NP-hard|'''NP'''-hard]] problems are those at least as hard as '''NP''' problems, i.e., all '''NP''' problems can be reduced (in polynomial time) to them. '''NP'''-hard problems need not be in '''NP''', i.e., they need not have solutions verifiable in polynomial time.

For instance, the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]] is '''NP'''-complete by the [[Cook–Levin theorem]], so ''any'' instance of ''any'' problem in '''NP''' can be transformed mechanically into an instance of the Boolean satisfiability problem in polynomial time. The Boolean satisfiability problem is one of many such '''NP'''-complete problems. If any '''NP'''-complete problem is in '''P''', then it would follow that '''P''' = '''NP'''. However, many important problems have been shown to be '''NP'''-complete, and no fast algorithm for any of them is known.

Based on the definition alone it is not obvious that '''NP'''-complete problems exist; however, a trivial and contrived '''NP'''-complete problem can be formulated as follows: given a description of a [[Turing machine]] ''M'' guaranteed to halt in polynomial time, does there exist a polynomial-size input that ''M'' will accept?&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Scott Aaronson|title=PHYS771 Lecture 6: '''P''', '''NP''', and Friends|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec6.html |accessdate=27 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in '''NP''' because (given an input) it is simple to check whether ''M'' accepts the input by simulating ''M''; it is '''NP'''-complete because the verifier for any particular instance of a problem in '''NP''' can be encoded as a polynomial-time machine ''M'' that takes the solution to be verified as input. Then the question of whether the instance is a yes or no instance is determined by whether a valid input exists.

The first natural problem proven to be '''NP'''-complete was the Boolean satisfiability problem, also known as SAT. As noted above, this is the Cook–Levin theorem; its proof that satisfiability is '''NP'''-complete contains technical details about Turing machines as they relate to the definition of '''NP'''. However, after this problem was proved to be '''NP'''-complete, [[reduction (complexity)|proof by reduction]] provided a simpler way to show that many other problems are also '''NP'''-complete, including the game Sudoku discussed earlier. In this case, the proof shows that a solution of Sudoku in polynomial time could also be used to complete [[Latin square]]s in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NP-completeness of Sudoku |url=http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/paul.goldberg/FCS/sudoku.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This in turn gives a solution to the problem of partitioning [[multipartite graph|tri-partite graphs]] into triangles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Colbourn, Charles J. |title=The complexity of completing partial Latin squares |journal=Discrete Applied Mathematics |volume=8 |issue=1 |year=1984 |pages=25–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which could then be used to find solutions for the special case of SAT known as 3-SAT,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=I. Holyer |title=The '''NP'''-completeness of some edge-partition problems |journal=SIAM J. Comput. |volume=10 |year=1981 |pages=713&amp;ndash;717}}&lt;/ref&gt; which then provides a solution for general Boolean satisfiability.  So a polynomial time solution to Sudoku leads, by a series of mechanical transformations, to a polynomial time solution of satisfiability, which in turn can be used to solve any other '''NP'''-complete problem in polynomial time.  Using transformations like this, a vast class of seemingly unrelated problems are all reducible to one another, and are in a sense "the same problem".

==Harder problems==
{{See also|Complexity class}}

Although it is unknown whether '''P''' = '''NP''', problems outside of '''P''' are known. Just as the class '''P''' is defined in terms of polynomial running time, the class '''[[EXPTIME]]''' is the set of all decision problems that have ''exponential'' running time. In other words, any problem in '''EXPTIME''' is solvable by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[big O notation|O]](2&lt;sup&gt;''p''(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;) time, where ''p''(''n'') is a polynomial function of ''n''. A decision problem is [[EXPTIME#EXPTIME-complete|'''EXPTIME'''-complete]] if it is in '''EXPTIME''', and every problem in '''EXPTIME''' has a [[polynomial-time many-one reduction]] to it. A number of problems are known to be '''EXPTIME'''-complete. Because it can be shown that '''P''' ≠ '''EXPTIME''', these problems are outside '''P''', and so require more than polynomial time. In fact, by the [[time hierarchy theorem]], they cannot be solved in significantly less than exponential time. Examples include finding a perfect strategy for [[chess]] positions on an ''N'' × ''N'' board&lt;ref name="Fraenkel1981"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = [[Aviezri Fraenkel]] and D.

The problem of deciding the truth of a statement in [[Presburger arithmetic]] requires even more time. Fischer and [[Michael O. Rabin|Rabin]] proved in 1974&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Michael J. | last1=Fischer | authorlink1=Michael J. Fischer | first2=Michael O. | last2=Rabin | authorlink2=Michael O.

Hence, the problem is known to need more than exponential run time. Even more difficult are the [[undecidable problem]]s, such as the [[halting problem]]. They cannot be completely solved by any algorithm, in the sense that for any particular algorithm there is at least one input for which that algorithm will not produce the right answer; it will either produce the wrong answer, finish without giving a conclusive answer, or otherwise run forever without producing any answer at all.

It is also possible to consider questions other than decision problems.  One such class, consisting of counting problems, is called [[Sharp-P#P|'''#P''']]: whereas an '''NP''' problem asks "Are there any solutions?", the corresponding '''#P''' problem asks "How many solutions are there?"  Clearly, a '''#P''' problem must be at least as hard as the corresponding '''NP''' problem, since a count of solutions immediately tells if at least one solution exists, if the count is greater than zero. Surprisingly, some '''#P''' problems that are believed to be difficult correspond to easy (for example linear-time) '''P''' problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Valiant, Leslie G. |title=The complexity of enumeration and reliability problems |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |volume=8 |issue=3 |year=1979 |pages=410–421 |doi=10.1137/0208032}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For these problems, it is very easy to tell whether solutions exist, but thought to be very hard to tell how many.  Many of these problems are [[Sharp-P-complete|'''#P'''-complete]], and hence among the hardest problems in '''#P''', since a polynomial time solution to any of them would allow a polynomial time solution to all other '''#P''' problems.

==Problems in NP not known to be in P or NP-complete==
{{Main article|NP-intermediate|l1='''NP'''-intermediate}}
It was shown by Ladner that if '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' then there exist problems in '''NP''' that are neither in '''P''' nor '''NP'''-complete.&lt;ref name="Ladner75" /&gt; Such problems are called '''NP'''-intermediate problems. The [[graph isomorphism problem]], the [[discrete logarithm problem]] and the [[integer factorization problem]] are examples of problems believed to be '''NP'''-intermediate. They are some of the very few '''NP''' problems not known to be in '''P''' or to be '''NP'''-complete.

The graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s are [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]]. An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in '''P''', '''NP'''-complete, or '''NP'''-intermediate. The answer is not known, but it is believed that the problem is at least not '''NP'''-complete.&lt;ref name="AK06"&gt;{{cite journal

The best algorithm for this problem, due to [[László Babai]] and [[Eugene Luks]], has run time 2&lt;sup&gt;O({{radic|''n'' log ''n''}})&lt;/sup&gt; for graphs with ''n'' vertices.

The [[integer factorization problem]] is the computational problem of determining the [[prime factorization]] of a given integer. Phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than ''k''. No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in '''NP''' and in '''[[co-NP]]''' (and even in '''UP''' and '''co-UP'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Lance Fortnow]]. Computational Complexity Blog: [http://weblog.fortnow.com/2002/09/complexity-class-of-week-factoring.html Complexity Class of the Week: Factoring]. 13 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;). If the problem is '''NP'''-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., '''NP''' = '''co-NP'''). The best known algorithm for integer factorization is the [[general number field sieve]], which takes expected time

:&lt;math&gt;O\left (\exp \left ( \left (\tfrac{64n}{9} \log(2) \right )^{\frac{1}{3}} \left ( \log(n\log(2)) \right )^{\frac{2}{3}} \right) \right )&lt;/math&gt;

to factor an ''n''-bit integer. However, the best known [[quantum algorithm]] for this problem, [[Shor's algorithm]], does run in polynomial time, although this does not indicate where the problem lies with respect to non-quantum complexity classes.

==Does P mean "easy"?==
[[File:KnapsackEmpComplexity.GIF|thumb|310 px|The graph shows time (average of 100 instances in ms using a 933 MHz Pentium III) vs.problem size for knapsack problems for a state-of-the-art specialized algorithm.

"Where are the hard knapsack problems?" Technical Report 2003/08, Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark&lt;/ref&gt;]]
All of the above discussion has assumed that '''P''' means "easy" and "not in '''P'''" means "hard", an assumption known as ''[[Cobham's thesis]]''. It is a common and reasonably accurate assumption in complexity theory; however, it has some caveats.

First, it is not always true in practice. A theoretical polynomial algorithm may have extremely large constant factors or exponents thus rendering it impractical. On the other hand, even if a problem is shown to be '''NP'''-complete, and even if '''P''' ≠ '''NP''', there may still be effective approaches to tackling the problem in practice. There are algorithms for many '''NP'''-complete problems, such as the [[knapsack problem]], the [[traveling salesman problem]] and the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]], that can solve to optimality many real-world instances in reasonable time. The empirical [[average-case complexity]] (time vs. problem size) of such algorithms can be surprisingly low.  An example is the [[simplex algorithm]] in [[linear programming]], which works surprisingly well in practice; despite having exponential worst-case [[time complexity]] it runs on par with the best known polynomial-time algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gondzio|first1=Jacek|last2=Terlaky|first2=Tamás|chapter=3 A computational view of interior point methods |mr=1438311 |title=Advances in linear and integer programming|pages=103–144|editor=J.&amp;nbsp;E.

Second, there are types of computations which do not conform to the Turing machine model on which '''P''' and '''NP''' are defined, such as [[quantum computation]] and [[randomized algorithm]]s.

==Reasons to believe P ≠ NP==
According to polls,&lt;ref name="poll"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title='''P''' vs. '''NP''' poll results|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=May 2012|volume=55|issue=5|page=10|first=Jack|last=Rosenberger|url=http://mags.acm.org/communications/201205?pg=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; most computer scientists believe that '''P'''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;'''NP'''. A key reason for this belief is that after decades of studying these problems no one has been able to find a polynomial-time algorithm for any of more than 3000 important known '''NP'''-complete problems (see [[List of NP-complete problems|List of '''NP'''-complete problems]]). These algorithms were sought long before the concept of '''NP'''-completeness was even defined ([[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems|Karp's 21 '''NP'''-complete problems]], among the first found, were all well-known existing problems at the time they were shown to be '''NP'''-complete). Furthermore, the result '''P''' = '''NP''' would imply many other startling results that are currently believed to be false, such as '''NP''' = '''[[co-NP]]''' and '''P''' = '''[[PH (complexity)|PH]]'''.

It is also intuitively argued that the existence of problems that are hard to solve but for which the solutions are easy to verify matches real-world experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=122 |author=Scott Aaronson |title=Reasons to believe}}, point 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|If '''P''' &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; '''NP''', then the world would be a profoundly different place than we usually assume it to be. There would be no special value in "creative leaps," no fundamental gap between solving a problem and recognizing the solution once it's found.| [[Scott Aaronson]], then at [[MIT]]}}

On the other hand, some researchers believe that there is overconfidence in believing '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' and that researchers should explore proofs of '''P''' = '''NP''' as well. For example, in 2002 these statements were made:&lt;ref name="poll" /&gt;
{{quote|The main argument in favor of '''P'''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;'''NP''' is the total lack of fundamental progress in the area of exhaustive search. This is, in my opinion, a very weak argument.

{{quote|Being attached to a speculation is not a good guide to research planning. One should always try both directions of every problem. Prejudice has caused famous mathematicians to fail to solve famous problems whose solution was opposite to their expectations, even though they had developed all the methods required.|[[Anil Nerode]], [[Cornell University]]}}

==Consequences of solution==
One of the reasons the problem attracts so much attention is the consequences of the answer.  Either direction of resolution would advance theory enormously, and perhaps have huge practical consequences as well.

===P = NP===
A proof that '''P''' = '''NP''' could have stunning practical consequences if the proof leads to efficient methods for solving some of the important problems in '''NP'''. It is also possible that a proof would not lead directly to efficient methods, perhaps if the proof is [[non-constructive proof|non-constructive]], or the size of the bounding polynomial is too big to be efficient in practice. The consequences, both positive and negative, arise since various '''NP'''-complete problems are fundamental in many fields.

Cryptography, for example, relies on certain problems being difficult. A constructive and efficient solution&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Exactly how efficient a solution must be to pose a threat to cryptography depends on the details.  A solution of &lt;math&gt;O(N^2)&lt;/math&gt; with a reasonable constant term would be disastrous.  On the other hand, a solution that is &lt;math&gt;\Omega(N^4)&lt;/math&gt; in almost all cases would not pose an immediate practical danger.&lt;/ref&gt; to an '''NP'''-complete problem such as [[Boolean satisfiability problem#3-satisfiability|3-SAT]] would break most existing cryptosystems including:
* Existing implementations of [[public-key cryptography]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |title=Hard instance generation for SAT |author=Horie, S. and Watanabe, O. |journal=Algorithms and Computation |pages=22–31 |year=1997

A 512 bit factoring problem (8400 MIPS-years when factored) translates to a SAT problem of 63,652 variables and 406,860 clauses.&lt;/ref&gt; a foundation for many modern security applications such as secure financial transactions over the Internet.
* [[Symmetric cipher]]s such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] or [[Triple DES|3DES]],&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite journal |title=Logical cryptanalysis as a SAT problem |author1=Massacci, F.  |author2=Marraro, L.  |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Journal of Automated Reasoning |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=165–203 |year=2000 |citeseerx=10.1.1.104.962 |doi=10.1023/A:1006326723002}} in which an instance of DES is encoded as a SAT problem with 10336 variables and 61935 clauses.  A 3DES problem instance would be about 3 times this size.&lt;/ref&gt; used for the encryption of communications data.
* [[Cryptographic hash function|Cryptographic hashing]] as the problem of finding a pre-image that hashes to a given value must be difficult in order to be useful, and ideally should require exponential time. However, if '''P'''='''NP''', then finding a pre-image ''M'' can be done in polynomial time, through reduction to SAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inversion attacks on secure hash functions using SAT solvers

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These would need to be modified or replaced by [[information-theoretic security|information-theoretically secure]] solutions not inherently based on '''P'''-'''NP''' equivalence.

On the other hand, there are enormous positive consequences that would follow from rendering tractable many currently mathematically intractable problems. For instance, many problems in [[operations research]] are '''NP'''-complete, such as some types of [[integer programming]] and the [[travelling salesman problem]]. Efficient solutions to these problems would have enormous implications for logistics. Many other important problems, such as some problems in [[protein structure prediction]], are also '''NP'''-complete;&lt;ref name="Berger"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[Bonnie Berger|Berger B]], [[F. Thomson Leighton|Leighton T]] |title=Protein folding in the hydrophobic-hydrophilic (HP) model is '''NP'''-complete |journal=J. Comput.

But such changes may pale in significance compared to the revolution an efficient method for solving '''NP'''-complete problems would cause in mathematics itself. Gödel, in his early thoughts on computational complexity, noted that a mechanical method that could solve any problem would revolutionize mathematics:&lt;ref&gt;History of this letter and its translation from {{cite web |title=The History and Status of the '''P''' versus '''NP''' question |author=Michael Sipser |url=http://cs.stanford.edu/people/trevisan/cs172-07/sipser92history.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.research.att.com/techdocs/TD_100899.pdf |title=A Brief History of NP-Completeness, 1954–2012 |author=David S.

After all, one would simply have to choose the natural number n so large that when the machine does not deliver a result, it makes no sense to think more about the problem.}}
Similarly, [[Stephen Cook]] says&lt;ref name="Official Problem Description"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Cook|title=The '''P''' versus '''NP''' Problem|publisher=[[Clay Mathematics Institute]] |date=April 2000 |url=http://www.claymath.org/sites/default/files/pvsnp.pdf |accessdate=18 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research mathematicians spend their careers trying to prove theorems, and some proofs have taken decades or even centuries to find after problems have been stated—for instance, [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] took over three centuries to prove. A method that is guaranteed to find proofs to theorems, should one exist of a "reasonable" size, would essentially end this struggle.

[[Donald Knuth]] has stated that he has come to believe that '''P''' = '''NP''', but is reserved about the impact of a possible proof:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2213858&amp;WT.rss_f=Article&amp;WT.rss_a=Twenty%20Questions%20for%20Donald%20Knuth&amp;WT.rss_ev=a|title=Twenty Questions for Donald Knuth|date=May 20, 2014|work=informit.com|publisher=[[InformIT (publisher)|InformIT]]|last=Knuth|first=Donald E.|authorlink=Donald Knuth|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=[...] I don't believe that the equality '''P''' = '''NP''' will turn out to be helpful even if it is proved, because such a proof will almost surely be nonconstructive.}}

===P ≠ NP===
A proof that showed that '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' would lack the practical computational benefits of a proof that '''P''' = '''NP''', but would nevertheless represent a very significant advance in computational complexity theory and provide guidance for future research. It would allow one to show in a formal way that many common problems cannot be solved efficiently, so that the attention of researchers can be focused on partial solutions or solutions to other problems. Due to widespread belief in '''P''' ≠ '''NP''', much of this focusing of research has already taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Heuristic Problem-Solving Approach |author=L. R. Foulds |journal=[[Journal of the Operational Research Society]] |volume=34 |issue=10 |date=October 1983 |pages=927–934 |jstor=2580891 |doi=10.2307/2580891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' still leaves open the [[average-case complexity]] of hard problems in '''NP'''.  For example, it is possible that SAT requires exponential time in the worst case, but that almost all randomly selected instances of it are efficiently solvable. [[Russell Impagliazzo]] has described five hypothetical "worlds" that could result from different possible resolutions to the average-case complexity question.&lt;ref&gt;R. Impagliazzo, [http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/average.ps "A personal view of average-case complexity,"] sct, pp.134, 10th Annual Structure in Complexity Theory Conference (SCT'95), 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  These range from "Algorithmica", where '''P''' = '''NP''' and problems like SAT can be solved efficiently in all instances, to "Cryptomania", where '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' and generating hard instances of problems outside '''P''' is easy, with three intermediate possibilities reflecting different possible distributions of difficulty over instances of '''NP'''-hard problems.  The "world" where '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' but all problems in '''NP''' are tractable in the average case is called "Heuristica" in the paper. A [[Princeton University]] workshop in 2009 studied the status of the five worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://intractability.princeton.edu/blog/2009/05/program-for-workshop-on-impagliazzos-worlds/|title = Tentative program for the workshop on "Complexity and Cryptography: Status of Impagliazzo's Worlds"|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131115034042/http://intractability.princeton.edu/blog/2009/05/program-for-workshop-on-impagliazzos-worlds/|archivedate = 2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results about difficulty of proof==
Although the '''P''' = '''NP''' problem itself remains open despite a million-dollar prize and a huge amount of dedicated research, efforts to solve the problem have led to several new techniques.  In particular, some of the most fruitful research related to the '''P''' = '''NP''' problem has been in showing that existing proof techniques are not powerful enough to answer the question, thus suggesting that novel technical approaches are required.

As additional evidence for the difficulty of the problem, essentially all known proof techniques in [[computational complexity theory]] fall into one of the following classifications, each of which is known to be insufficient to prove that '''P''' ≠ '''NP''':
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Classification
!Definition
|-
|[[Relativizing proof]]s
|Imagine a world where every algorithm is allowed to make queries to some fixed subroutine called an ''[[oracle machine|oracle]]'' (a black box which can answer a fixed set of questions in constant time, such as a black box that solves any given traveling salesman problem in 1 step), and the running time of the oracle is not counted against the running time of the algorithm. Most proofs (especially classical ones) apply uniformly in a world with oracles regardless of what the oracle does. These proofs are called ''relativizing''. In 1975, Baker, Gill, and [[Robert M. Solovay|Solovay]] showed that '''P''' = '''NP''' with respect to some oracles, while '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' for other oracles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=T. P. Baker |author2=J. Gill |author3=R. Solovay. |title=Relativizations of the '''P''' =? '''NP''' Question |journal=[[SIAM Journal on Computing]] |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=431–442 |year=1975 |doi=10.1137/0204037}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since relativizing proofs can only prove statements that are uniformly true with respect to all possible oracles, this showed that relativizing techniques cannot resolve '''P''' = '''NP'''.
|-
|[[Natural proof]]s
|In 1993, [[Alexander Razborov]] and [[Steven Rudich]] defined a general class of proof techniques for circuit complexity lower bounds, called ''[[natural proof]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Razborov, Alexander A. |author2=Steven Rudich |title=Natural proofs |journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences |volume=55 |issue=1 |year=1997 |pages=24–35 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002200009791494X |doi=10.1006/jcss.1997.1494}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time all previously known circuit lower bounds were natural, and circuit complexity was considered a very promising approach for resolving '''P''' = '''NP'''. However, Razborov and Rudich showed that, if [[one-way functions]] exist, then no natural proof method can distinguish between '''P''' and '''NP'''. Although one-way functions have never been formally proven to exist, most mathematicians believe that they do, and a proof of their existence would be a much stronger statement than '''P''' ≠ '''NP'''. Thus it is unlikely that natural proofs alone can resolve '''P''' = '''NP'''.
|-
|Algebrizing proofs
|After the Baker-Gill-Solovay result, new non-relativizing proof techniques were successfully used to prove that [[IP (complexity)|IP]] = [[PSPACE]]. However, in 2008, [[Scott Aaronson]] and [[Avi Wigderson]] showed that the main technical tool used in the '''IP''' = '''PSPACE''' proof, known as ''arithmetization'', was also insufficient to resolve '''P''' = '''NP'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=S. Aaronson  |author2=A. Wigderson  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory |conference=Proceedings of ACM STOC'2008 |year=2008 |url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/alg.pdf |doi=10.1145/1374376.1374481 |pages=731–740}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

These barriers are another reason why '''NP'''-complete problems are useful: if a polynomial-time algorithm can be demonstrated for an '''NP'''-complete problem, this would solve the '''P''' = '''NP''' problem in a way not excluded by the above results.

These barriers have also led some computer scientists to suggest that the '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem may be [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of standard axiom systems like [[ZFC]] (cannot be proved or disproved within them). The interpretation of an independence result could be that either no polynomial-time algorithm exists for any '''NP'''-complete problem, and such a proof cannot be constructed in (e.g.) ZFC, or that polynomial-time algorithms for '''NP'''-complete problems may exist, but it is impossible to prove in ZFC that such algorithms are correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/indep.pdf|first=Scott|last=Aaronson|authorlink=Scott Aaronson|title=Is '''P''' Versus '''NP''' Formally Independent?|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if it can be shown, using techniques of the sort that are currently known to be applicable, that the problem cannot be decided even with much weaker assumptions extending the [[Peano axioms]] (PA) for integer arithmetic, then there would necessarily exist nearly-polynomial-time algorithms for every problem in '''NP'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On the independence of '''P''' versus '''NP'''|first1=Shai|last1=Ben-David |first2=Shai|last2=Halevi |series=Technical Report|volume=714|publisher=Technion|year=1992|url=http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~shai/ph.ps.gz|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if one believes (as most complexity theorists do) that not all problems in '''NP''' have efficient algorithms, it would follow that proofs of independence using those techniques cannot be possible. Additionally, this result implies that proving independence from PA or ZFC using currently known techniques is no easier than proving the existence of efficient algorithms for all problems in '''NP'''.

==Logical characterizations==
The '''P''' = '''NP''' problem can be restated in terms of expressible certain classes of logical statements, as a result of work in [[descriptive complexity]].

Consider all languages of finite structures with a fixed [[signature (logic)|signature]] including a [[linear order]] relation. Then, all such languages in '''P''' can be expressed in [[first-order logic]] with the addition of a suitable least [[fixed-point combinator]]. Effectively, this, in combination with the order, allows the definition of recursive functions. As long as the signature contains at least one predicate or function in addition to the distinguished order relation, so that the amount of space taken to store such finite structures is actually polynomial in the number of elements in the structure, this precisely characterizes '''P'''.

Similarly, '''NP''' is the set of languages expressible in existential [[second-order logic]]—that is, second-order logic restricted to exclude [[universal quantification]] over relations, functions, and subsets. The languages in the [[polynomial hierarchy]], '''[[PH (complexity)|PH]]''', correspond to all of second-order logic. Thus, the question "is '''P''' a proper subset of '''NP'''" can be reformulated as "is existential second-order logic able to describe languages (of finite linearly ordered structures with nontrivial signature) that first-order logic with least fixed point cannot?".&lt;ref&gt;Elvira Mayordomo. [http://www.unizar.es/acz/05Publicaciones/Monografias/MonografiasPublicadas/Monografia26/057Mayordomo.pdf "P versus NP"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216154228/http://www.unizar.es/acz/05Publicaciones/Monografias/MonografiasPublicadas/Monografia26/057Mayordomo.pdf |date=16 February 2012 }} ''Monografías de la Real Academia de Ciencias de Zaragoza'' '''26''': 57–68 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The word "existential" can even be dropped from the previous characterization, since '''P''' = '''NP''' if and only if '''P''' = '''PH''' (as the former would establish that '''NP''' = '''co-NP''', which in turn implies that '''NP''' = '''PH''').

==Polynomial-time algorithms==
No algorithm for any '''NP'''-complete problem is known to run in polynomial time. However, there are algorithms known for '''NP'''-complete problems with the property that if '''P''' = '''NP''', then the algorithm runs in polynomial time on accepting instances (although with enormous constants, making the algorithm impractical). However, these algorithms do not qualify as polynomial time because their running time on rejecting instances are not polynomial. The following algorithm, due to [[Leonid Levin|Levin]] (without any citation), is such an example below. It correctly accepts the '''NP'''-complete language [[subset sum problem|SUBSET-SUM]]. It runs in polynomial time on inputs that are in SUBSET-SUM if and only if '''P''' = '''NP''':

 ''// Algorithm that accepts the '''NP'''-complete language SUBSET-SUM.
 ''//
 ''// this is a polynomial-time algorithm if and only if '''P''' = '''NP'''.
 ''//
 ''// "Polynomial-time" means it returns "yes" in polynomial time when
 ''// the answer should be "yes", and runs forever when it is "no".
 ''//
 ''// Input: S = a finite set of integers
 ''// Output: "yes" if any subset of S adds up to 0.
 ''// Runs forever with no output otherwise.
 ''// Note: "Program number M" is the program obtained by
 ''// writing the integer M in binary, then
 ''// considering that string of bits to be a
 ''// program. Every possible program can be
 ''// generated this way, though most do nothing
 ''// because of syntax errors.''
 FOR K = 1...∞
   FOR M = 1...K
     Run program number M for K steps with input S
     IF the program outputs a list of distinct integers
       AND the integers are all in S
       AND the integers sum to 0
     THEN
       OUTPUT "yes" and HALT

If, and only if, '''P''' = '''NP''', then this is a polynomial-time algorithm accepting an '''NP'''-complete language. "Accepting" means it gives "yes" answers in polynomial time, but is allowed to run forever when the answer is "no" (also known as a ''semi-algorithm'').

This algorithm is enormously impractical, even if '''P''' = '''NP'''. If the shortest program that can solve SUBSET-SUM in polynomial time is ''b'' bits long, the above algorithm will try at least {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} other programs first.

==Formal definitions==

===P and NP===
Conceptually speaking, a ''decision problem'' is a problem that takes as input some [[String (computer science)|string]] ''w'' over an alphabet Σ, and outputs "yes" or "no". If there is an [[algorithm]] (say a [[Turing machine]], or a [[Computer programming|computer program]] with unbounded memory) that can produce the correct answer for any input string of length ''n'' in at most ''cn&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' steps, where ''k'' and ''c'' are constants independent of the input string, then we say that the problem can be solved in ''polynomial time'' and we place it in the class '''P'''. Formally, '''P''' is defined as the set of all languages that can be decided by a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \{ L : L=L(M) \text{ for some deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine } M \}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;L(M) = \{ w\in\Sigma^{*}: M \text{ accepts } w \}&lt;/math&gt;
and a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine ''M'' that satisfies the following two conditions:

# ''M'' halts on all input ''w'' and
# there exists &lt;math&gt;k \in N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;T_M(n)\in O(n^k)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''O'' refers to the [[Big O notation#Formal definition|big O notation]] and
::&lt;math&gt;T_M(n) = \max\{ t_M(w) : w\in\Sigma^{*}, |w| = n \}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;t_M(w) = \text{ number of steps }M\text{ takes to halt on input }w.&lt;/math&gt;

'''NP''' can be defined similarly using nondeterministic Turing machines (the traditional way). However, a modern approach to define '''NP''' is to use the concept of ''[[Certificate (complexity)|certificate]]'' and ''verifier''. Formally, '''NP''' is defined as the set of languages over a finite alphabet that have a verifier that runs in polynomial time, where the notion of "verifier" is defined as follows.

Let ''L'' be a language over a finite alphabet, Σ.

''L'' ∈ '''NP''' if, and only if, there exists a binary relation &lt;math&gt;R\subset\Sigma^{*}\times\Sigma^{*}&lt;/math&gt; and a positive integer ''k'' such that the following two conditions are satisfied:

# &lt;abbr title="For all strings x in Σ*, x is in L if and only if there is a y in Σ* such that (x, y) is in R and the length of y is polynomial in the length of x"&gt;For all &lt;math&gt;x\in\Sigma^{*}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x\in L \Leftrightarrow\exists y\in\Sigma^{*}&lt;/math&gt; such that (''x'', ''y'') ∈ ''R'' and &lt;math&gt;|y|\in O(|x|^k)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt;; and
# the language &lt;abbr title="L[R], consisting of x followed by y with a delimiter in the middle"&gt;&lt;math&gt;L_{R} = \{ x\# y:(x,y)\in R\}&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\cup\{\#\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt; is decidable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time.

A Turing machine that decides ''L&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' is called a ''verifier'' for ''L'' and a ''y'' such that (''x'', ''y'') ∈ ''R'' is called a ''certificate of membership'' of ''x'' in ''L''.

In general, a verifier does not have to be polynomial-time. However, for ''L'' to be in '''NP''', there must be a verifier that runs in polynomial time.

====Example====
Let
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{COMPOSITE} = \left \{x\in\mathbb{N} \mid x=pq \text{ for integers } p, q &gt; 1 \right \}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R = \left \{(x,y)\in\mathbb{N} \times\mathbb{N} \mid 1&lt;y \leq \sqrt x \text{ and } y \text{ divides } x \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;
Clearly, the question of whether a given ''x'' is a [[Composite number|composite]] is equivalent to the question of whether ''x'' is a member of COMPOSITE. It can be shown that COMPOSITE ∈ '''NP''' by verifying that it satisfies the above definition (if we identify natural numbers with their binary representations).

COMPOSITE also happens to be in '''P''', a fact demonstrated by the invention of the [[AKS primality test]].&lt;ref name="Agrawal"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Manindra |last=Agrawal |first2=Neeraj |last2=Kayal |first3=Nitin |last3=Saxena |url=http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/manindra/algebra/primality_v6.pdf |title=PRIMES is in '''P''' |journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |volume=160 |year=2004 |issue=2 |pages=781–793 |doi=10.4007/annals.2004.160.781 |jstor=3597229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NP-completeness===
{{Main|NP-completeness}}

There are many equivalent ways of describing '''NP'''-completeness.

Let ''L'' be a language over a finite alphabet Σ.

''L'' is '''NP'''-complete if, and only if, the following two conditions are satisfied:

# ''L'' ∈ '''NP'''; and
# any ''L′'' in '''NP''' is polynomial-time-reducible to ''L'' (written as &lt;math&gt;L' \leq_{p} L&lt;/math&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;L' \leq_{p} L&lt;/math&gt; if, and only if, the following two conditions are satisfied:
## There exists ''f'' : Σ* → Σ* such that for all ''w'' in Σ* we have: &lt;math&gt;(w\in L' \Leftrightarrow f(w)\in L)&lt;/math&gt;; and
## there exists a polynomial-time Turing machine that halts with ''f''(''w'') on its tape on any input ''w''.

Alternatively, if ''L'' ∈ '''NP''', and there is another '''NP'''-complete problem that can be polynomial-time reduced to ''L'', then ''L'' is '''NP'''-complete. This is a common way of proving some new problem is '''NP'''-complete.

The '''Parable of the Invisible Gardener''' is a tale originally told by [[John Wisdom]]. It was later developed in the university debate by [[Antony Flew]], who made several important changes such as changing the gardeners to explorers and making original "long neglected garden" a clearing in the jungle. It is often used to illustrate the perceived differences between assertions based on [[faith]] and assertions based on [[scientific evidence]], and the problems associated with [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] beliefs. Flew's main claim in using the parable is that religious believers do not allow anybody to "falsify" their assertions, instead they simply change their beliefs to suit the questioner. Thus Flew concludes that religious believers cause God to "die the death of a thousand qualifications". In Flew's version, the tale runs as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Once upon a time two explorers came upon a clearing in the jungle. In the clearing were growing many flowers and many weeds. One explorer says, "Some gardener must tend this plot." The other disagrees, "There is no gardener." So they pitch their tents and set a watch. No gardener is ever seen. "But perhaps he is an invisible gardener." So they set up a barbed-wire fence. They electrify it. They patrol with bloodhounds. (For they remember how H. G. Well's ''The Invisible Man'' could be both smelt and touched though he could not be seen.) But no shrieks ever suggest that some intruder has received a shock. No movements of the wire ever betray an invisible climber. The bloodhounds never give cry. Yet still the Believer is not convinced. "But there is a gardener, invisible, intangible, insensible, to electric shocks, a gardener who has no scent and makes no sound, a gardener who comes secretly to look after the garden which he loves. At last the Skeptic despairs, "But what remains of your original assertion? Just how does what you call an invisible, intangible, eternally elusive gardener differ from an imaginary gardener or even from no gardener at all?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/flew_falsification.html|title=Antony Flew "Theology and Falsification," 1950|website=www.stephenjaygould.org|access-date=2016-09-26}} {{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fitting''' is used in pipe systems to connect the straight [[pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]] or [[tube (fluid conveyance)|tubing]] sections, adapt to different sizes or shapes and for other purposes, such as regulating (or measuring) [[fluid]] flow. "Plumbing" is generally used to describe the conveyance of water, gas, or liquid waste in domestic or commercial environments; "piping" is often used to describe the high-performance (high-pressure, high-flow, high-temperature or hazardous-material) conveyance of fluids in specialized applications. "Tubing" is sometimes used for lighter-weight piping, especially that flexible enough to be supplied in coiled form.

Fittings (especially uncommon types) require money, time, materials and tools to install, and are an important part of [[piping]] and [[plumbing]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Use Proper Plumbing Tools To Avoid Flushing Money Down The Drain|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;dat=19961025&amp;id=yKlJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XQ4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3739,2736500|accessdate=26 December 2013|newspaper=Bangor Daily News|date=October 25, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valve]]s are technically fittings, but are usually discussed separately.

== Standards ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
{{geographical imbalance |usa |date=January 2017}}
Standard codes are followed when designing (or manufacturing) a piping system. Organizations which promulgate piping standards include:

* [[ASME]]: American Society of Mechanical Engineers
** A112.19.1 Enameled cast-iron and steel plumbing fixtures standards
** A112.19.2 Ceramic plumbing fixtures standard
* [[ASTM International]]: American Society for Testing and Materials
* API: [[American Petroleum Institute]]
* AWS: [[American Welding Society]]
* AWWA: [[American Water Works Association]]
* MSS: Manufacturers Standardization Society
* ANSI: [[American National Standards Institute]]
* NFPA: [[National Fire Protection Association]]
* EJMA: [[Expansion Joint Manufacturers Association]]
* CGA: [[Compressed Gas Association]]

Pipes must conform to the dimensional requirements of:

* ASME B36.10M: Welded and seamless wrought-steel pipe
* ASME B36.19M: Stainless-steel pipe
* ASME B31.3 2008: Process piping
* ASME B31.4 XXXX: Power piping

The B31.3 and B31.4 codes have requirements for piping found in petroleum refineries; chemical, pharmaceutical, textile, paper, semiconductor, and cryogenic plants, and related processing plants and terminals. These codes specify requirements for materials and components, design, fabrication, assembly, erection, examination, inspection and testing of piping. The codes are applicable to piping for all fluids, including raw, intermediate and finished chemicals; petroleum products; gas, steam, air and water; fluidized solids;  refrigerants, and cryogenic fluids.

== Material ==
[[File:BritanniaIronWorksTubeFittings.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Plumbing fittings on a board|Display of threaded cast-iron fittings]]

The material with which a pipe is manufactured is often the basis for choosing a pipe. Materials used for manufacturing pipes include:

* [[Carbon steel|Carbon]] (CS) and [[Galvanization|galvanized]] steel
* Impact-tested carbon steel (ITCS)
* Low-temperature carbon steel (LTCS)
* [[Stainless steel]] (SS)
* [[Malleable iron]]
* Non-ferrous metals (includes [[copper]], [[inconel]], [[incoloy]] and [[cupronickel]])
* Non-metallic (includes [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS), [[fibre-reinforced plastic]] (FRP), [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), [[high-density polyethylene]] (HDPE) and [[toughened glass]])
* Chrome-molybdenum (alloy) steel — Generally used for high-temperature service

The bodies of fittings for pipe and tubing are most often the same base material as the pipe or tubing connected: copper, [[steel]], PVC, [[chlorinated polyvinyl chloride]] (CPVC) or ABS. Any material permitted by the plumbing, health, or building [[Building code|code]] (as applicable) may be used, but it must be compatible with the other materials in the system, the fluids being transported and the temperature and pressure inside (and outside) the system.  [[Brass]] or [[bronze]] fittings are common in copper piping and plumbing systems. [[Fire protection|Fire hazards]], [[earthquake]] resistance and other factors also influence the choice of fitting materials.

== Gaskets ==
[[Gasket]]s are mechanical seals, usually [[O-ring|ring-shaped]], which seal flange joints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Proper Replacement Of Gaskets Important |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19630226&amp;id=kf5HAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eYAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6577,5763223 |accessdate=December 26, 2013|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate |date=Feb 26, 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaskets vary by construction, materials and features. Commonly used gaskets are non-metallic (ASME B 16.21), spiral-wound (ASME B 16.20) and ring-joint (ASME B 16.20). Non-metallic gaskets are used with flat- or raised-face flanges. Spiral-wound gaskets are used with raised-face flanges, and ring-joint gaskets are used with ring-type joint (RTJ) flanges. Stress develops between an RTJ gasket and the flange groove when the gasket is bolted to a flange, leading to plastic deformation of the gasket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wermac.org/gaskets/gaskets.html|title=Gaskets General – Non-Metallic Flat, Spiral Wound Gaskets, Camprofile Gaskets, Metal-Jacketed Gaskets and Metallic Gaskets -|work=wermac.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Gender of fittings}}Gender ==
{{See also|Gender of connectors and fasteners}}
Piping or tubing is usually inserted into fittings to make connections. Connectors are assigned a gender, abbreviated M or F. An example of this is a "3/4-inch female adapter NPT", which would have a corresponding male connection of the same size and thread standard (in this case, [[National pipe thread|NPT]]).

==Common piping and plumbing fittings ==
{{anchor|Common fittings for both piping and plumbing}}
This section discusses fittings primarily used in pressurized piping systems, though there is some overlap with fittings for low-pressure or non-pressurized systems. Specialized fittings for the latter setups are discussed in the next major subsection.

=== Elbow ===
{{See also|Street elbow}}
[[File:1-1111 CU-solderfitting-type 5041.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Short, 45-degree copper elbow|Short-radius (or regular) 45° elbow (copper sweat)]]
[[File:1-1111 CU-solderfitting-type 5002-18.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Large copper elbow|Long-radius (or sweep) 90° elbow (copper sweat)]]
An elbow is installed between two lengths of pipe (or tubing) to allow a change of direction, usually a 90° or 45° [[angle]]; 22.5° elbows are also available. The ends may be machined for [[Welding|butt welding]], [[Threaded pipe|threaded]] (usually [[Gender of connectors and fasteners|female]]), or socketed. When the ends differ in size, it is known as a reducing (or reducer) elbow.

A 90º elbow, also known as a "90 bend", "90 ell" or "quarter bend", attaches readily to plastic, copper, cast iron, steel, and lead, and is attached to rubber with stainless-steel clamps. Other available materials include silicone, rubber compounds, galvanized steel, and nylon. It is primarily used to connect hoses to valves, [[water pump]]s and deck drains. A 45º elbow, also known as a "45 bend" or "45 ell", is commonly used in water-supply facilities, food, chemical and electronic industrial pipeline networks, air-conditioning pipelines, agriculture and garden production, and solar-energy facility piping.

Elbows are also categorized by length. The [[radius of curvature]] of a long-radius (LR) elbow is 1.5 times the pipe diameter, but a short-radius (SR) elbow has a radius equal to the pipe diameter.  Short elbows, widely available, are typically used in pressurized systems, and in physically tight locations.

Long elbows are used in low-pressure gravity-fed systems and other applications where low turbulence and minimum deposition of entrained solids are of concern.  They are available in [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS plastic), [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), [[chlorinated polyvinyl chloride]] (CPVC), and copper, and are used in [[Drain-waste-vent system|DWV systems]], sewage, and [[central vacuum]] systems.

=== Coupling ===
[[File:1-1111 CU-solderfitting-type 5270.jpg|thumb|alt=Short copper tube|Pipe coupling (copper sweat)]]
A [[coupling (piping)|coupling]] connects two pipes. If their sizes differ, the fitting is known as a '''reducing coupling''', '''reducer''', or an '''adapter'''. There are two types of couplings: "regular" and "slip". A regular coupling has a small ridge or stop internally, to prevent over-insertion of a pipe, and thus under-insertion of the other pipe segment (which would result in an unreliable connection). A '''slip coupling''' (sometimes also called a '''repair coupling''') is deliberately made without this internal stop, to allow it to be slipped into place in tight locations, such as the repair of a pipe that has a small leak due to [[corrosion]] or [[freezing|freeze]] bursting, or which had to be cut temporarily for some reason.. Since the alignment stop is missing, it is up to the installer to carefully measure the final location of the slip coupling to ensure that it is located correctly.

=== Union ===
[[File:Verschraubung 4072.jpg|thumb|alt=Two identical couplings, one assembled and one disassembled|Combination union and reducer (brass threaded)]]
A union, similar to a coupling, allows the convenient future disconnection of pipes for maintenance or fixture replacement. In contrast to a coupling requiring [[solvent welding]], [[soldering]], or rotation (for threaded couplings), a union allows easy connection and disconnection, multiple times if needed. It consists of three parts: a nut, a female end and a male end. When the female and male ends are joined, the nut seals the joint by pressing the two ends tightly together. Unions are a type of very compact flange connector.

'''Dielectric unions''', with [[dielectric]] insulation, separate dissimilar metals (such as copper and galvanized steel) to prevent [[galvanic corrosion]]. When two dissimilar metals are in contact with an electrically conductive solution (ordinary tap water is conductive), they form an electrochemical couple which generates a voltage by [[electrolysis]]. When the metals are in direct contact with each other, the [[electric current]] from one to the other also moves metallic [[ion]]s from one to the other; this dissolves one metal, depositing it on the other. A dielectric union breaks the electrical path with a plastic liner between its halves, limiting galvanic corrosion.

[[Rotary union]]s allow mechanical [[rotation around a fixed axis|rotation]] of one of the joined parts, while resisting leakage.

=== Nipple ===
{{Main|Nipple (plumbing)}}
[[File:Plumbing Nipple.jpg|100px|thumb|alt=See caption|Nipple]]
A nipple is a short stub of pipe, usually male-threaded [[steel]], brass, chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC), or copper (occasionally unthreaded copper), which connects two other fittings. A nipple with continuous uninterrupted threading is known as a '''close nipple'''. Nipples are commonly used with plumbing and hoses.

=== Reducer ===
[[File:Reduzierstuecke 4055.jpg|thumb|alt=See caption|Bronze threaded (at left) and copper [[Soldering|sweat]] (at right) reducers]]
{{Main|Reducer}}
A reducer allows for a change in pipe size to meet [[hydraulic]] flow requirements of the system or adapt to existing piping of a different size. Although reducers are usually [[concentric]], [[eccentric reducer]]s are used as needed to maintain the top- or bottom-of-pipe level.

=== Double-tapped bushing ===
A double-tapped bushing is a fitting which serves as a [[reducer]]. It is a sleeve similar to a [[Piping and plumbing fitting#Nipple|close nipple]], but is threaded on both its inner and outer circumferences. Like a reducer, a double-tapped bushing has two threads of different sizes.

A double-tapped bushing is more compact than a reducer, but not as flexible. While a double-tapped bushing has a smaller female thread concentric to a larger male thread (and thus couples a smaller male end to a larger female), a reducer may have large and small ends of either gender. If both ends are the same gender, it is a ''gender-changing reducer''.

There are similar fittings for both sweat and solvent joinery. Since they are not "tapped" (threaded), they are simply called '''reducing bushings'''.

=== Tee ===
{{anchor|Olets}}
[[File:1-1111 CU-solderfitting-type 5130-22.jpg|thumb|alt=T-shaped connector|Copper sweat tee]]
A tee, the most common pipe fitting, is used to combine (or divide) fluid flow. It is available with female thread sockets, solvent-weld sockets or opposed solvent-weld sockets and a female-threaded side outlet. Tees can connect pipes of different diameters or change the direction of a pipe run, or both. Available in a variety of materials, sizes and finishes, they may also be used to transport two-fluid mixtures.{{explain|date=March 2017}} Tees may be equal or unequal in size of their three connections, with equal tees the most common.

===Diverter tee===
This specialized type of tee fitting is used primarily in pressurized [[hydronic heating]] systems, to divert a portion of the flow from the main line into a side branch connected to a radiator or heat exchanger. The diverter tee is designed to allow flow to continue in the main line, even when the side branch is shut down and not calling for heat. Diverter tees have directional markings which must be heeded; a tee installed backwards will function very poorly.

=== Cross ===
Crosses, also known as '''four-way fittings''' or '''cross branch lines''', have one inlet and three outlets (or vice versa), and often have solvent-welded socket or female-threaded ends. Cross fittings may stress pipes as temperatures change, because they are at the center of four connection points. A tee is steadier than a cross; it behaves like a three-legged stool, and a cross behaves like a four-legged stool. [[Geometry|Geometrically]], any three non-[[collinear]] points can self-consistently define a plane; three legs are inherently stable, whereas four points overdetermine a plane, and can be inconsistent, resulting in physical stress on a fitting.

Crosses are common in [[fire sprinkler]] systems (where stress caused by thermal expansion is not generally an issue),{{why|date=March 2017}} but are not common in plumbing. One cross fitting is more expensive than two tees.{{why|date=March 2017}}

===Cap ===
{{anchor|Cap}}
[[File:1-1111 CU-solderfitting-type 5301.jpg|thumb|alt=See caption|Copper sweat cap]]
Caps, usually liquid- or gas-tight, cover the otherwise open end of a pipe. A '''cap''' attaches to the exterior of a pipe, and may have a solvent-weld socket end or a female-threaded interior. The exterior of an industrial cap may be round, square, rectangular, U- or I-shaped, or may have a handgrip. If a solvent-weld cap is used to provide for a future connection point, several inches of pipe must be left before the cap; when the cap is cut off for the future connection, enough pipe must remain to allow a new fitting to be glued onto it.

===Plug===
{{anchor|Plug}}&lt;!-- [[Pipe plug]] redirects here --&gt;
A '''plug''' fits inside the pipe segment or fitting.

=== Barb ===
[[File:Brass Crimp Fittings.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Ten different hose barbs|Brass PEX fittings, not to be confused for hose barbs.]]
A barb (or hose barb), which connects flexible hose or tubing to pipes, typically has a male-threaded end which mates with female threads. The other end of the fitting has a single- or multi-barbed tube—a [[truncated cone|long tapered cone]] with ridges, which is inserted into a flexible hose. An adjustable [[worm drive]] screw clamp (or other type of clamp) is often added, to keep the hose from slipping off the barbed tube. Barb fittings can be made of brass for hot-water applications, and plastic may be used for cold water; brass is considered more durable for heavy-duty use. The barb fitting may be elbow-shaped or straight.
===Valve ===
{{anchor|Valves}}
{{Main|Valve}}
[[File:Kitchen renovation leaky valve beneath kitchen sink.JPG|thumb|alt=|Compression connections on water shutoff valves under a kitchen sink show evidence of slow seepage (greenish deposits).]]
Valves stop (or regulate) the flow of liquids or gases. They are categorized by application, such as isolation, throttling, and non-return.

Isolation valves are used to temporarily disconnect part of a piping system, to allow maintenance or repair, for example. Isolation valves are typically left in either a fully open or fully closed position. A given isolation valve may be in place for many years without being operated, but must be designed to be readily operable whenever needed, including emergency use.

Throttling valves are used to control the amount or pressure of a fluid allowed to pass through, and are designed to withstand the stress and wear caused by this type of operation. Because they may wear out in this usage, they are often installed alongside isolation valves which can temporarily disconnect a failing throttling valve from the rest of the system, so it can be refurbished or replaced.

Non-return or check valves allow free flow of a fluid in one direction, but prevent its flow in a reverse direction. They are often seen in drainage or sewage systems, but may also be used in pressurized systems.

Valves are available in a number of types, based on design and purpose:
* Gate, plug, or ball valves – Isolation 
* Globe valve – Throttling
* Needle valve – Throttling, usually with high precision but low flow
* Butterfly or diaphragm valves – Isolation and throttling
* Check valve – Preventing reverse flow (non-return)

== Drain-waste-vent (DWV) and related fittings ==
[[File:Cast fe and cu dwv piping.jpg|thumb|alt=Pipes under a floor|Flexible rubber sleeves are used to connect this cast-iron and copper DWV installation.]]
Because they operate at low [[pressure]] and rely on [[gravity]] to move fluids (and entrained solids), [[drain-waste-vent system]]s use fittings whose interior surfaces are as smooth as possible. The fittings may be "belled" (expanded slightly in diameter) or otherwise shaped to accommodate the insertion of pipe or tubing without forming a sharp interior ridge that might catch debris or accumulate material, and cause a clog or blockage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=You Can Fix Plumbing Problems With The Right Equipment .|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=894&amp;dat=19961020&amp;id=w51aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qU0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4623,2547431|accessdate=December 27, 2013|newspaper=The Daily Courier|date=October 20, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freshly cut ends of pipe segments are carefully deburred to remove projecting slivers of material which may snag debris (such as hair or fibers) which can build up to cause blockages. This internal smoothness also makes it easier to "snake out" or "rod out" a clogged pipe with a [[plumber's snake]].

Underground piping systems for [[landscaping]] [[drainage]] or the disposal of [[stormwater]] or [[groundwater]] also use low-pressure gravity flow, so fittings for these systems resemble larger-scale DWV fittings. With high peak-flow volumes, the design and construction of these systems may resemble those of [[storm sewer]]s.

Fittings for [[central vacuum system]]s are similar to DWV fittings, but are usually of thinner and lighter construction because the weight of the materials conveyed is less. Vacuum-system designs share with DWV designs the need to eliminate internal ridges, burrs, sharp turns, or other obstructions which might create clogs.

=== Slip-joint fitting ===
{{anchor|Slip joint fitting}}
Slip-joint fittings are frequently used in kitchen, bathroom and tub drainage systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freeonlineplumber.com/slip.html|title=Slip-Joint|work=freeonlineplumber.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include a detached (movable) slip nut and slip-joint washer; the washer is made of rubber or nylon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/43927/in-slip-joints-whats-the-difference-between-rubber-and-nylon-washers|title=plumbing – In slip joints, what's the difference between rubber and nylon washers? - Home Improvement Stack Exchange|work=stackexchange.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; An advantage of this of fitting is that the pipe it is connecting to does not need to be cut to a precise length; the slip joint can attach within a range of the end of the inserting pipe. Many slip fittings may be tightened or loosened by hand, for easier access to residential drainpipe systems (for example, to clean out a trap or access a drain line past a trap).

=== Sweep elbow ===
DWV elbows are usually long-radius ("sweep") types. To reduce flow resistance and solid deposits when the direction of flow is changed, they use a shallow curve with a large [[radius of curvature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/24796/how-do-i-make-my-bathroom-pipes-more-practical/25057#25057|title=plumbing – How do I make my bathroom pipes more practical? - Home Improvement Stack Exchange|work=stackexchange.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a well-designed system will often use two 45° elbows instead of one 90° elbow (even a sweep 90° elbow) to reduce flow disruption as much as possible.

Central vacuum system inlet fittings are intentionally designed with a tighter radius of curvature than those of other bends in the system. If vacuumed debris becomes stuck it will jam at the inlet, where it is easy to find and remove.

=== Closet flange ===
A [[closet flange]] (the drainpipe [[flange]] to which a [[flush toilet]] is attached) is a specialized flange designed to be flush with the floor, allowing a toilet to be installed above it. The flange must be mechanically strong to accommodate slight misalignments or movements, and resist corrosion.

===Clean-out ===
{{anchor|Clean-outs}}
Clean-outs are fittings with removable elements, allowing access to drains without the removal of plumbing fixtures. They are used to allow an auger (or plumber's snake) to clean out a plugged drain. Since clean-out augers are limited in length, clean-outs should be placed in accessible locations at regular intervals throughout a drainage system (including outside the building). Minimum requirements are typically at the end of each branch in piping, just ahead of each water closet, at the base of each vertical stack and inside and outside the building in the main drain or sewer. Clean-outs usually have screw-on caps or screw-in plugs. They are also known as "rodding eyes", because of the eye-shaped cover plates often used on external versions.

===Trap primer ===
{{anchor|Trap primers}}
A [[trap primer]] automatically injects water into a [[Trap (plumbing)|trap]], maintaining a water seal to keep [[sewer gas]] out of buildings. It must be installed in an easily accessible place for adjustment, replacement, and repair. A trap primer, a specialized [[valve]], is usually connected to a clean-water supply in addition to a DWV system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Advise Check Of Drains|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&amp;dat=19371004&amp;id=IvQzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ce8HAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5059,519100|date=Oct 4, 1937|newspaper=Lodi News-Sentinel|accessdate=2013-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the dual connection, it must be designed to resist the accidental [[backflow]] of contaminated water.

=== Combo tee ===
{{anchor|Combo-tee}}
&lt;!-- Need a picture or diagram of this fitting --&gt;
A combination tee (combo tee, combo wye, tee wye, long-sweep wye, or combi) is a tee with a gradually curving central connecting joint: a wye plus an additional 1/8 bend (45°), combined in one 90° unit. It is used in drains for a smooth, gradually curving path to reduce the likelihood of clogs, to ease the pushing of a plumber's snake through a drain system and to encourage water flow in the direction of the drain.

=== Sanitary tee ===
&lt;!-- Diagram needed to make this more understandable --&gt;
A sanitary tee has a curved center section. In drainage systems, it is primarily used to connect horizontal drains (including fixture trap arms) to vertical drains. The center connection is generally to the pipe leading to a trap (the trap arm). It must not connect a vertical drain to a horizontal drain, because of the likelihood that solids will accumulate at the bottom of the junction and cause a blockage.

=== Baffle tee ===
Also called a tee with diverter baffle, a waste tee or an end-outlet tee, it typically connects waste lines before they enter the trap and has a baffle to keep water from one waste pipe from entering the other at the connection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nettally.com/palmk/GDplumbing.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Double sanitary tee (sanitary cross) ===
This fitting differs from a standard cross in that two of the ports have curved inlets. Although it has been used in the past for connecting the drains of back-to-back fixtures (such as back-to-back sinks), some current codes—including the 2006 [[Uniform Plumbing Code]] in the United States—prohibit the use of this fitting for that purpose and require a double-fixture fitting (double combination wye) to minimize wastewater from one side flowing into the other.

=== Wye (Y) fitting ===
{{anchor|Wye ("Y") fitting}}
&lt;!-- Diagram needed to make this more understandable --&gt;
A fitting with three openings, a wye joins (or creates) branch lines. It is a waste-fitting tee in which the side inlet pipe enters at a 45-degree angle, or an angle other than 90 degrees. A standard wye is a Y-shaped fitting which allows one pipe to be joined to another at a 45 degree angle.

Wyes are similar to tees, except for the angling of the branch line to reduce friction and turbulence. They are commonly used to attach a vertical drainpipe to a horizontal one. The connection is typically at a 45-degree, rather than 90 degrees; if a branch turns out further at the end to 90 degrees (perpendicular), the fitting becomes a [[#Combo-tee|combo tee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diy.stackexchange.com/a/83497/11265|title=plumbing – combo tee vs. tee wye – Home Improvement Stack Exchange|work=stackexchange.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wyes and combo wyes follow a long-sweep pattern&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ci.camarillo.ca.us/docs/Drainage%20Piping.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; relative to sanitary tees and other short-sweep bends, which have a smaller radius and require less space. A wye may also be used to split a branch line equally in two directions, such as the splitting of a main line into two smaller branches.

Wyes also have industrial applications. Although low-priced wyes are often [[Spot welding|spot-welded]], industrial-strength wyes are [[Flash welding|flash-welded]] at each seam. In long-distance pipeline applications, a wye is used for [[pigging]] to maintain flow.

=== Side inlet TY (tee-wye)===
&lt;!-- Diagram needed to make this more understandable --&gt;
This fitting (also known as a "bungalow fitting" or a "cottage fitting") is a sanitary T that allows two trap arms to be connected at the same level. A toilet is the main connection, with the option of a right or left-hand outlet to the 3" inlet with a choice of 1-1/2" or 2" in size. It is for keeping stack-vented fixtures high to the joist space and thus conserving head room in a basement. As the water closet must be the lowest fixture, the smaller side outlet (usually used to connect the bathtub trap arm) enters slightly above the larger connection.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

== Hydraulic fittings ==
{{Main|Hydraulic machinery}}
Hydraulic systems use high fluid pressure, such as the [[hydraulic cylinder|hydraulic actuators]] for [[bulldozer]]s and [[backhoe]]s. Their hydraulic fittings are designed and rated for much greater pressure than that experienced in general piping systems, and they are generally not compatible with those used in plumbing. Hydraulic fittings are designed and constructed to resist high-pressure leakage and sudden failure.

== Connection methods ==
Much of the work of installing a piping or plumbing system involves making leakproof, reliable connections, and most piping requires mechanical support against [[gravity]] and other forces (such as [[wind load]]s and [[earthquake]]s) which might disrupt an installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Methods Simplify Plumbing Problems|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&amp;dat=19330926&amp;id=JF4hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CYYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=743,2474599|accessdate=December 26, 2013|newspaper=Schenectady Gazette|date=Sep 26, 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the connection technology and application, basic skills may be sufficient, or specialized skills and [[professional licensing|professional licensure]] may be legally required.

=== Fasteners ===
Fasteners join, or affix, two or more objects. Although they are usually used to attach pipe and fittings to mechanical supports in buildings, they do not connect the pipes to each other. Fasteners commonly used with piping are a stud bolt with nuts (usually fully threaded, with two heavy, hexagonal nuts); a machine bolt and nut; or a [[powder-actuated tool]] (PAT) fastener (usually a [[nail (fastener)|nail]] or [[threaded rod|threaded stud]], driven into concrete or masonry).

=== Threaded pipe ===
{{See also|National pipe thread|British Standard Pipe}}
[[File:Malefemalepipe.jpg|thumb|alt=Threaded pipe and elbow|Male threaded pipe and female threaded elbow]]

A [[threaded pipe]] has a [[screw thread]] at one or both ends for assembly. Steel pipe is often joined with threaded connections; tapered threads are cut into the end of the pipe, sealant is applied in the form of [[pipe dope|thread-sealing compound]] or [[thread seal tape]] (also known as  [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] or Teflon tape) and the pipe is threaded into a threaded fitting with a [[pipe wrench]].

Threaded steel pipe is widely used in buildings to convey [[natural gas]] or [[propane]] fuel, and is a popular choice in [[fire sprinkler]] systems due to its resistance to mechanical damage and high heat. Threaded steel pipe may still be used in high-security locations, because it is more resistant to vandalism, more difficult to remove, and its scrap value is lower than copper or brass.

in older installations, threaded [[brass]] pipe was similarly used, and was considered superior to steel for drinking water, because it was more resistant to [[corrosion]].

Assembling threaded steel pipe takes skill and planning to allow lengths of pipe to be screwed together in sequence. Most threaded-pipe systems require the use of strategically located pipe-union fittings in final assembly. Threaded steel pipe is heavy, and requires adequate attachment to support surfaces. Despite its thick walls steel pipe is no longer preferred for conveying drinking water, because corrosion can cause leakage especially at threaded joints, and deposits on internal surfaces will eventually restrict flow.

=== Solvent welding ===
{{Main|Plastic welding#Solvent welding|l1=Solvent welding}}
[[File:Polypropylene-PPR-Pipe-Tee 173369-480x360 (5000534776).jpg|thumb|alt=Three white plastic fittings: two tees and a union|Polypropylene fittings for solvent welding]]

A solvent is applied to [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[Chlorinated polyvinyl chloride|CPVC]], [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] or other plastic piping to partially dissolve and fuse the adjacent surfaces of piping and fitting. Solvent welding is usually used with a sleeve-type joint to connect pipe and fittings made of the same (or compatible) material.

Unlike metal welding, solvent welding is relatively easy to perform (although care is needed to make reliable joints). Solvents typically used for plastics are usually [[toxic]]{{cn|date=April 2017}} and may be [[carcinogenic]]{{cn|date=April 2017}} and [[flammable]], requiring adequate ventilation.
{{clear}}

=== Soldering ===
[[File:Copper Brass Fitting Soldering.JPG|thumb|alt=See caption|Brass fitting soft-soldered to copper pipe]]
To make a [[Soldering#Pipe soldering|solder]] connection, a chemical [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] is applied to the inner sleeve of a joint and the pipe is inserted. The joint is then heated using a [[propane torch|propane]] or [[MAPP gas]] torch, solder is applied to the heated joint and the molten solder is drawn into the joint by [[capillary action]] as the flux vaporizes. "Sweating" is a term sometimes used to describe the soldering of pipe joints.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Where many connections must be made in a short period of time (such as plumbing of a new building), soldering is quicker and less expensive joinery than compression or flare fittings.   A degree of skill is needed to make a number of reliable soldered joints quickly. If flux residue is thoroughly cleaned, soldering can produce a long-lasting connection at low cost.  However, the use of an open flame for heating joints can present fire and health hazards to building occupants, and requires adequate ventilation.

=== Brazing ===
[[Brazing]] is a thermal joining process in which two pieces of base metal are joined by a molten brazing filler metal which is drawn between them by capillary action. The process can be used to join most metals and alloys commonly used in engineering. A brazing filler metal has a high melting temperature, which is nevertheless lower than the melting point of the metals being joined. Brazing can join pipes, rods, and metal pieces which fit tightly against each other without large gaps; it can even join [[tungsten carbide]], ceramics, and similar non-metallic materials.

Well-brazed joints are as strong as their parent-metal pieces and can withstand demanding service. With smooth, neat [[Fillet (mechanics)|fillets]], they have good electrical conductivity.
{{clear}}

=== Welding ===
[[File:Pipe root weld with HAZ.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=See caption|Partially welded steel pipe joint]]
The [[welding]] of metals differs from soldering and brazing in that the joint is made without adding a lower-melting-point material (e.g. solder); instead, the pipe or tubing material is partially melted and the fitting and piping are directly fused. This generally requires that the piping and fitting are the same (or compatible) material. Skill is required to melt the joint sufficiently to ensure good fusion, while not deforming or damaging the pieces being joined.

Properly welded joints are considered reliable and durable. Pipe welding is often performed by specially licensed workers whose skills are retested periodically. For critical applications, every joint is tested with [[nondestructive testing|nondestructive]] methods. Because of the skills required, welded pipe joints are usually restricted to high-performance applications such as [[shipbuilding]], and in [[chemical reactor|chemical]] and [[nuclear reactor]]s.

Adequate [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] is essential to remove [[Metal fume fever|metal fumes]] from welding operations, and [[personal protective equipment]] must be worn. Because the high temperatures during welding can often generate intense [[ultraviolet light]], dark goggles or full face shields must be used to protect the eyes. Precautions must also be taken to avoid starting fires caused by stray sparks and hot welding debris.

=== Compression fittings ===
{{Main|Compression fitting}}
[[File:Compression fitting isolating valve 15mm screwdriver turn.jpg|thumb|alt=Disassembled three-piece valve|Compression connectors on an isolating valve; the reddish part is a copper compression ring]]
Compression fittings (sometimes called "lock-bush fittings") consist of a tapered, concave conical seat; a hollow, barrel-shaped compression ring (sometimes called a ferrule); and a compression nut which is threaded onto the body of the fitting and tightened to make a leakproof connection. They are typically made of brass or plastic, but stainless steel or other materials may be used.

Although compression connections are less durable than sweated connections, they are easy to install with simple tools. However, they take longer to install than sweated joints and sometimes require re-tightening to stop slow leaks which may develop over time. Because of this possible leakage, they are generally restricted to accessible locations (such as under a kitchen or bathroom sink), and are prohibited in concealed locations such as the interiors of walls.

=== Flare fittings ===

[[File:Flare koppeling.png|thumb|Flare connection: 1) Screw thread; 2) O-ring; 3) Body; 4) Nut; 5) Seal interface; 6) Support ring (sleeve), and 7) Flared tubing]]

Flared connectors should not be confused with compression connectors, with which they are generally not interchangeable. Lacking a compression ring, they use a [[truncated cone|tapered conical]] shaped connection instead. A specialized flaring tool is used to enlarge tubing into a 45º tapered bell shape matching the projecting shape of the flare fitting.&lt;ref name="Pro" /&gt;{{rp|82}} The flare nut, which had previously been installed over the tubing, is then tightened over the fitting to force the tapered surfaces tightly together. Flare connectors are typically made of brass or plastic, but stainless steel or other materials may be used.

Although flare connections are labor-intensive, they are durable and reliable. Considered more secure against leaks and sudden failure, they are used in [[hydraulic brake]] systems, and in other high-pressure, high-reliability applications.

=== Flange fittings ===
[[File:Gasket.svg|thumb|alt=Illustration of fitting, indicating direction of flow|Flange connection with a gasket]]
Flange fittings are generally used for connections to valves, inline instruments or equipment nozzles. Two surfaces are joined tightly together with threaded [[Screw|bolts]], [[wedge (mechanical device)|wedges]], clamps, or other means of applying high [[compression (physical)|compressive]] force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seal Between Flange, Toilet When Troubleshooting In Leaky bathrooms|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1388&amp;dat=20020904&amp;id=_wgkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QxIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5035,5621038 |accessdate=December 27, 2013 |newspaper=Northwest Columbus News |date=September 4, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a [[gasket]], [[seal (mechanical)|packing]], or [[O-ring]] may be installed between the flanges to prevent leakage, it is sometimes possible to use only a special grease or nothing at all (if the mating surfaces are sufficiently precisely formed). Although flange fittings are bulky, they perform well in demanding applications such as large [[water supply network]]s and [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] systems. 

Flanges are rated at 150, 300, 400, 600, 900, 1500 and 2500&amp;nbsp;lbs or 10, 15, 25, 40, 64, 100 and 150 [[Bar (unit)|bars]] of pressure. Various types of flanges are available, depending on construction. Flanges used in piping (orifice, threaded, slip-on, blind, [[Weld neck flange|weld neck]], socket, lap-joint, and reducing) are available with a variety of facings, such as raised, flat, and ring-joint.

Slip-on flanges are slipped over the pipe and welded to provide strength and prevent leakage. This flange is less expensive than a weld neck and requires less accuracy when cutting pipe to length. Blind flanges are used to shut off a piping system or opening, while still allowing easy access for inspection.

A weld neck flange is joined to a piping system by [[butt welding]]. Although its long neck (or hub) makes it expensive, it reduces mechanical stress on piping by distributing stress between the base of the flange and the wall at the weld. Turbulence and erosion are reduced due to the matching size of the pipe and flange.

A socket flange appears similar to a slip-on flange, but its bore is counter-bored to accept pipe. A [[fillet weld]] around the hub of the flange attaches the flange to the pipe, with an interval weld added in high-stress applications. It is most frequently used in high-pressure systems, such as hydraulic and steam lines.

A lap-joint flange is similar to a slip-on, with room at the intersection of the bore and the flange face for a lap stub end. The face of the stub end conforms to the gasket face of the flange. It is used where sections of piping need to be dismantled quickly and easily for inspection or replacement.

=== Mechanical fittings ===
[[File:VictaulicPiping.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Large pipes connected with clamps|Mechanical sleeve clamps]]
Manufacturers such as [[Victaulic]] and [[Grinnell Grooved Products|Grinnell]] produce sleeve-clamp fittings which are replacing many flange connections. They attach to the end of a pipe segment via circumferential grooves pressed (or cut) around the end of the pipe to be joined.  They are widely used on larger steel pipes, and can also be used with other materials.

The chief advantage of these connectors is that they can be installed after cutting the pipe to length in the field. This can save time and considerable expense compared to flange connections, which must be factory- or field-welded to pipe segments. However, mechanically fastened joints are sensitive to [[residual stress|residual]] and thickness stresses caused by dissimilar metals and temperature changes.

A grooved fitting, also known as a grooved coupling, has four elements: grooved pipe, gasket, coupling housing, and nuts and bolts. The groove is made by cold-forming (or machining) a groove at the end of a pipe. A gasket encompassed by coupling housing is wrapped around the two pipe ends, with the coupling engaging the groove; the bolts and nuts are tightened with a [[Socket wrench|socket]] or [[impact wrench]]. The installed coupling housing encases the gasket and engages the grooves around the pipe to create a leakproof seal in a self-restrained pipe joint. There are two types of grooved coupling; a flexible coupling allows a limited amount of angular movement, and a rigid coupling does not allow movement and may be used where joint immobility is required (similar to a flange or welded joint).

=== Crimped or pressed fittings ===
[[File:Pressfittings 3.jpg|thumb|alt=Several different fittings, ready for pressing|Fittings for crimping]]
Crimped or pressed connections use special fittings which are permanently attached to tubing with a powered crimper. The fittings, manufactured with a pre-installed sealant, slide over the tubing to be connected. High pressure is used to deform the fitting and compress the sealant against the inner tubing, creating a leakproof seal.

The advantages of this method are durability, speed, neatness, and safety. Some crimped fittings are designed to be used with copper tubing, without requiring flux or filler metal. The connection can be made even when the tubing is wet. Although crimped fittings are suitable for drinking-water pipes and other hot-and-cold systems (including central heating), they are substantially more expensive than sweated fittings.

Pressfittings with either  V and M profile (V Contour &amp; M Contour) in stainless steel, carbon steel and copper are highly popular in Europe, and several manufacturers such as, Viega, Gebrit, Swiss Fittings, and ISOTUBI, distribute system dependent press fittings. When compared to other connection types, press fittings has the advantage of installation speed, and safety. Pressing a stainless steel fittings can be completed within 5 seconds with the correct equipment. Major pressing of fittings to pipes or other fittings is completed through electric press machines, however also mechanical press machines are available. Most of the major brands further have a plastic slip on the end of the press fittings allowing a simple identification if a press fittings has securely been installed. Further, the installation does not use any welding, thus press fittings, with appropriate and region specific certification, be installed for gas lines. Stainless steel and carbon steel press fittings can hold up to 16 bars of pressure. 

=== Leaded hub fittings===
[[File:Leaded hub.jpg|thumb|Diagram showing the construction of a typical leaded hub joint.]]
[[File:Cast-iron plumbing pipe.jpg|thumb|This view looking upwards through a hole in the ceiling shows a traditional leaded hub joint (at top) and a more recent rubber sleeved hubless connection (at lower left).]]
Cast iron piping was traditionally made with one spigot end(plain) and one socket or hub end(cup shaped). In use, the spigot of one segment was placed into the socket of the preceding one and a ring of [[oakum]] was forced down into the joint with a [[caulking iron]]. After this the remainder of the space in the hub was filled up. Ideally, this would be done by pouring in molten [[lead]], allowing it to set, and hammering it tightly with a caulking tool. If this was not possible due to position or some other factor the joint could alternatively be filled with [[lead wool]] or rope heavily packed down one layer at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Damm, John A. and Waugaman, Charles H. (1948) ''The Practical and Technical Encyclopedia'' Wm. H. Wise &amp; Co., Inc. New York. pg. 94,395,396&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rubber sleeve fittings ===
Cast iron DWV fittings are still used in premium construction because they muffle the sound of wastewater rushing through them,&lt;ref name="Pro"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cauldwell|first1=Rex|title=Plumbing (for pros, by pros)|date=2007|publisher=Random House Inc|location=Newtown, CT|isbn=978-1-56158-817-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|149}} but today they are rarely joined with traditional lead joints. Instead, pipe and fittings with plain (non-belled) connections are butted against each other, and clamped with special rubber sleeve (or "no-hub") fittings.&lt;ref name="TPC"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cauldwell|first1=Rex|title=Taunton's plumbing complete : expert advice from start to finish|date=2009|publisher=Taunton Press|location=Newtown, CT|isbn=978-1-56158-855-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|71}} The rubber sleeves are jacketed with stainless steel clamps, which compress the rubber to make a tight seal around the pipes and fittings.&lt;ref name="TPC" /&gt;{{rp|71}}  Although the materials are not cheap, they are durable (the rubber is typically [[neoprene]] or [[PVC]]). 

An advantage of flexible rubber fittings is that they can accommodate small misalignments, and can be flexed slightly for installation in tight locations.&lt;ref name="Pro" /&gt;{{rp|147}} If necessary, the joints can be disassembled later, and the fittings and pipe may be reconfigured; however, it is often not customary to re-use the clamps and rubber sleeves.

'''Plant transformation vectors''' are [[plasmid]]s that have been specifically designed to facilitate the generation of transgenic plants.  The most commonly used plant transformation vectors are termed [[binary vectors]] because of their ability to replicate in both ''[[E. coli]]'', a common lab bacterium, and ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]'', a bacterium used to insert the recombinant (customized) DNA into plants.
Plant Transformation vectors contain three key elements;
* Plasmids Selection (creating a custom circular strand of DNA)
* Plasmids Replication (so that it can be easily worked with)
* [[Transfer DNA]] (T-DNA) region (inserting the DNA into the agrobacteria)

==Steps in plant transformation==
Propagate binary vector in ''E. coli''

Isolate binary vector from ''E.coli'' and engineer (introduce a foreign gene)

Re-introduce engineered binary vector into ''E. coli'' to amplify

Isolate engineered binary vector and introduce into ''Agrobacteria'' containing a modified (relatively small) Ti plasmid

Infect plant tissue with engineered ''Agrobacteria'' (T-DNA containing the foreign gene gets inserted into a plant cell genome)

In each cell T-DNA gets integrated at a different site in the genome

Note: There are many variations to these steps. A custom DNA plasmid sequence can be created and replicated in more than one way.

=== Consequences of the insertion ===
Foreign DNA inserted

Insertional mutagenesis (but not lethal for the plant cell – as the organism is diploid)

=== Problem ===
We want to transform the whole organism, not just one cell. This is done by transforming plant cells in culture, selecting transformed cells and regenerating an entire plant from the transformed cell (e.g. tobacco)

==Plasmid selection==
When the bacteria with the desired, implanted gene are grown, they are made containing a selector. A selector is a way to isolate and distinguish the desired cells. A gene that makes the cells resistant to an antibiotic such as the antibiotics [[kanamycin]], [[ampicillin]], [[spectinomycin]] or [[tetracyclin]], is an easy selector to use. The desired cells (along with any other organisms growing within the culture) can be treated with an antibiotic, allowing the desired cells to survive while other organisms cannot. The antibiotic gene is not usually transferred to the plant cell but remains within the bacterial cell.

==Plasmids replication==
[[Plasmids]] replicate to produce many plasmid molecules in each host bacterial cell.  The number of copies of each plasmid in a bacterial cell is determined by the [[replication origin]].  This is the position within the plasmids molecule where DNA replication is initiated.  Most [[binary vectors]] have a higher number of plasmids copies when they replicate in ''[[E. coli]]'', the plasmid copy-number is usually less when the plasmid is resident within ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]''.
Plasmids can also be replicated in the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR).

==T-DNA region==

T-DNA contains two types of genes: the oncogenic genes, encoding for enzymes involved in the synthesis of auxins and cytokinins and responsible for tumor formation; and the genes encoding for the synthesis of opines. These compounds, produced by condensation between amino acids and sugars, are synthesized and excreted by the crown gall cells and consumed by A. tumefaciens as carbon and nitrogen sources. Outside the T-DNA, are located the genes for the opine catabolism, the genes involved in the process of T-DNA transfer from the bacterium to the plant cell and the genes involved in bacterium-bacterium plasmid conjugative transfer. (Hooykaas and Schilperoort, 1992; Zupan and Zambrysky, 1995).
The T-DNA fragment is flanked by 25-bp direct repeats, which act as a cis element signal for the transfer apparatus. The process of T-DNA transfer is mediated by the cooperative action of proteins encoded by genes determined in the Ti plasmid virulence region (vir genes) and in the bacterial chromosome. The Ti plasmid also contains the genes for opine catabolism produced by the crown gall cells, and regions for conjugative transfer and for its own integrity and stability. The 30 kb virulence (vir) region is a regulon organized in six operons that are essential for the T-DNA transfer (virA, virB, virD, and virG) or for the increasing of transfer efficiency (virC and virE) (Hooykaas and Schilperoort, 1992; Zupan and Zambryski, 1995, Jeon et al., 1998). Different chromosomal-determined genetic elements have shown their functional role in the attachment of A. tumefaciens to the plant cell and bacterial colonization: the loci chvA and chvB, involved in the synthesis and excretion of the b -1,2 glucan (Cangelosi et al., 1989); the chvE required for the sugar enhancement of vir genes induction and bacterial chemotaxis (Ankenbauer et al., 1990, Cangelosi et al., 1990, 1991); the cel locus, responsible for the synthesis of cellulose fibrils (Matthysse 1983); the pscA (exoC) locus, playing its role in the synthesis of both cyclic glucan and acid succinoglycan (Cangelosi et at., 1987, 1991); and the att locus, which is involved in the cell surface proteins (Matthysse, 1987).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9572">'''Railway troops''' are soldiers who are also [[railway engineer]]s. They build, repair, operate or destroy militarily relevant [[railway line]]s and their associated infrastructure.

== History ==
The establishment of railway troops by the [[great power]]s followed the emergence, rapid growth and rising importance of the [[railway]] network, when the advantages of the railway for the transport of troops, heavy weapons and supplies became recognised. Originally these were known (at least in the German-speaking areas of Europe) as [[field railway]]s. In many countries, however, there were little or no military units of this type.

=== American Civil War ===
In the [[American Civil War]], unlimited authority over all railway lines in the [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] was given to General [[George B. McClellan|McClellan]]. To begin with, McClellan formed a construction corps from ordinary soldiers, but he soon recognised that the lack of training of these troops for technical work meant that a specially organised corps was needed within the Union Army for technically trained civil engineers and workers. During the war this branch of the army grew to about 25,000 men. They were divided into railway operating units as well as construction units with sub-units for line and bridge building.

The construction units had the task of building new lines, repairing destroyed railway facilities or even destroying them themselves. The operating units managed the provision and proper use of operational materiel and services. For large construction projects, civilian workers were also contracted, for example, up to 1,400 carpenters were employed to build the [[Etowah_River#History|Etowah]] and [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] Bridge.

The large and often decisive influence that these railway troops had on the course of the American Civil war, resulted in the European states establishing similar formations.

=== Germany ===
==== Prussia ====
&lt;!-- [[File:BahnhoefeSchoeneberg.jpg|thumb|left|On this 1893 map of Berlin, the barracks and military railway station of the 2nd Railway Regiment may be seen below the [[parade ground]].]] --&gt;
[[File:Schmalspurlok der Eisenbahnbrigade.JPG|thumb|upright|Narrow gauge railway brigade engine from 1918/19]]
In 1866, [[Prussia]] formed three railway units during [[mobilisation]] for the [[Austro-Prussian War]]. These units comprised twelve railway engineers and a detachment of about 50 men provided by the [[Ministry of Trade]].
The 2nd Railway Regiment (''II. Eisenbahnregiment'') was linked to the [[Royal Prussian Military Railway]] at Berlin. This railway, which was part of the army budget was managed by the Royal Military Railway Division (''Königliche Direction der Militäreisenbahn'').

The activity of the railway regiment was similar to that of the American construction units, whilst operating commissions (''Betriebskommissionen''), specially raised by the Ministry of Trade, ran operations on the occupied railways.

==== Bavaria ====
Until the [[First World War]], there was a Royal Bavarian Railway Battalion in [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. A monument in the [[Railway Barracks, Munich|Bundeswehr Headquarters]] on [[Munich]]'s [[Dachauer Straße]] (on the corner of Hedwig-Dransfeld-Allee) commemorates the Bavarian railway troops and is open to the public.

==== German Empire ====
Experience from the Austro-Prussia War led to plans for a permanent military organisation for [[field railway]]s which, even during peacetime, would maintain a cadre of personnel trained in railway engineering. Because this could not be achieved by the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870, field railway units were again raised: five Prussian units and one Bavarian unit. They were, however, considerably better equipped than those of 1866: each had 20 civilian engineers, 4 officers and about 200 foremen and soldiers. In addition, for larger construction tasks, additional civilian workers were engaged. The operation of railway in the occupied territories was again taken over by operating commissions. The railway units were frequently deployed during the Franco-Prussian War, for example in repairing bridges that had been destroyed and in constructing the railway to circumnavigate the fortress at [[Metz Fortress|Metz]].

In Prussia, on 1 October 1871, a railway battalion was formed, the basis for the subsequent railway regiment and for the Railway Brigade, established on 1 April 1890, which had 3  [[regiment]]s each of two [[battalion]]s of four [[company (army)|companies]]. The Railway Brigade was given a depot management and an operating unit for the operation of the  [[Royal Prussian Military Railway]], whose officers and men were provided in turn by various the units within the Brigade.

From 1 October 1899, the railway troops became part of the [[Corps of Transport]] (''Verkehrstruppen'') and were thus placed under the Inspector of Transport. Its men were trained in railway construction and railway operations and were intended to replace the old field railway units with railway companies and the operation commissions with railway operating companies and military railway divisions. In war, the railway troops were reinforced by reserves and [[Landwehr (military)|Landwehr soldiers]].

To train the railway troops, responsibility for managing the railway line from [[Berlin]] via [[Zossen]] to [[Jüterbog]] ([[Royal Prussian Military Railway]]) had been transferred to the army.&lt;ref&gt;''Das kleine Buch vom deutschen Heere'', Verlag von Lipsius&amp;nbsp;&amp; Tischler, Kiel and Leipzig, 1901, p.&amp;nbsp;203.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these facilities for the construction and operation of  [[standard gauge]] railway, the railway troops managed materiel in order to be able to build and operate [[field railway]]s. These were utilised on a large scale during the [[First World War]] behind the [[front line]] for the transport of troops and supplies. The field railways were subordinated to the Master of Field Railways (''Chef des Feldeisenbahnwesens'' or FECH). Railways troops were also deployed by Germany during the [[Second World War]].

==== West and East Germany ====
Shortly after its foundation, the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' established a railway engineering training and trials company which, in 1961, was renamed (Sp)PiLVsuKp 872 and became part of 870 Special Engineer Training and Trials Battalion (''Spezialpionierlehr- und Versuchsbataillon 870'') in the [[German Territorial Army]]. The company was disbanded in 1974 and its tasks taken on by other engineer units.

In the [[Nationale Volksarmee|NVA]] there continued to be railway engineer units. As a result, the history of railway troops in Germany ended with the disbandment of the NVA in 1990.

=== Switzerland ===
Until 2003, the [[Swiss Army]] had a branch of service for military railway operations and for a few years beyond that continued to have the so-called ''Eisenbahnsappeurkompanien'' ("railway engineer companies").&lt;ref&gt;Paul Winter: ''Die Geschichte des Militäreisenbahndienstes.

'''Remote Touch''' is a vehicle interface system present in some [[Lexus]] cars for use in conjunction with in-car information, configuration, and entertainment systems. The Remote Touch controller, which is similar to a [[computer mouse]] or [[joystick]], allows the driver to operate an on-screen [[Cursor (computers)|cursor]] on the vehicle's [[GPS]] navigation system screen.&lt;ref name=controller&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-10102845-48.html|title=2010 Lexus RX gets update, new Remote Touch controller|date=2008-11-19|publisher=CNET.com|last=Goodwin|first=Antuan|accessdate=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remote Touch utilizes [[haptic feedback]], where the controller provides reaction force, and [[force feedback]], where the on-screen cursor can move to nearby buttons automatically.&lt;ref name=pcmag&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2341432,00.asp|title=Hands On: Lexus' Remote Touch Beats iDrive|work=[[PC Magazine]]|accessdate=2009-02-24|last=Howard|first=Bill|date=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; System functions can be configured by the driver.&lt;ref name=luxel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://luxvelocity.typepad.com/luxvelocity/2009/07/lexus-puts-the-world-at-your-fingertips.html|title=Lexus puts the world at your fingertips|publisher=Luxvelocity|accessdate=2009-07-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727111313/http://luxvelocity.typepad.com/luxvelocity/2009/07/lexus-puts-the-world-at-your-fingertips.html|archive-date=2009-07-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remote Touch was first introduced on the 2010 [[Lexus RX 350]] and [[Lexus RX 450h]] models,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pressroom.toyota.com/pr/tms/lexus/LEX-15-08.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531061138/http://pressroom.toyota.com/pr/tms/lexus/LEX-15-08.aspx |archive-date=2009-05-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the 2010 [[Lexus HS 250h]].&lt;ref name=hs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autos.canada.com/2009detroit1/story.html?id=ab0a6063-8d73-4391-8821-0d3da7eae485&amp;p=1|title=Full details on Hybrid Lexus HS 250h|publisher=Driving.ca|date=2009-01-11|accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Prior to the advent of Remote Touch, Lexus interiors were typically equipped with [[touchscreen]] interfaces.  Although this system was regarded by many reviewers as easier to use than conventional [[Rotary dial|rotary knob]] controllers,&lt;ref name=int1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.edmunds.com/straightline/2009/04/automotive-interfaces-part-i-touch-screen-or-idrive-.html|title=Automotive Interfaces Part I: Touch Screen or iDrive|publisher=Edmunds.com|accessdate=2009-07-23|last=Austria|first=Albert}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the need to place the touchscreen within easy reach limited design possibilities for the interior (by forcing placement of the screen in the center dash and in close proximity to the steering wheel).  The enhanced technology trend in the automotive industry also resulted in a plethora of ever-increasing buttons and switches on many luxury vehicles.&lt;ref name=int1/&gt;

[[File:Remote Touch lexus profile.jpg|thumb|Side view of the Remote Touch controller]]
In response, several luxury brands had switched to rotary knob control devices, with the aim to simplify cabin layout and consolidate multiple controls with a single device.&lt;ref name=int1/&gt; The BMW [[iDrive]], Audi [[Multi Media Interface|MMI]], and Mercedes-Benz [[COMAND APS]] interfaces operated using a circular center knob which can be rotated side to side, and pressed to select items, with the rotary knob scrolling through on-screen menus. Of these systems, some reviewers praised their ability to simplify the dash layout,&lt;ref name=int1/&gt; while others levied criticism for reputed complexity and user difficulty, particularly with iDrive.&lt;ref name=ab/&gt;&lt;ref name=mt/&gt;&lt;ref name=wr/&gt;

In the mid 2000s, Lexus began developing an alternative to the touchscreen interface, in light of the latter's restrictions on interior styling and [[Dashboard|instrument panel]] configuration.&lt;ref name=int2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.edmunds.com/straightline/2009/04/automotive-interfaces-part-ii-does-lexus-have-the-answer.html|title=Automotive Interfaces Part II: Does Lexus Have the Answer?|publisher=Edmunds.com|accessdate=2009-07-23|last=Austria|first=Albert|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420145431/http://blogs.edmunds.com/straightline/2009/04/automotive-interfaces-part-ii-does-lexus-have-the-answer.html|archivedate=2009-04-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prototype development and consumer testing was conducted to develop a new control device.  Consumer research conducted with Lexus supplier [[Denso]] corporation indicated that the prototype control system required no more mental or physical effort than a touchscreen, plus offered interior layouts with more screen visibility, was physically more comfortable to operate, and easier to use while in motion.&lt;ref name=int2/&gt;

==Design==
Unveiled by Lexus at the 2008 [[Los Angeles Auto Show]] in November of that year, Remote Touch became Lexus' entry into the realm of non-touchscreen [[human-machine interface]]s. Introduced on the third generation [[Lexus RX]], the Remote Touch system differs from previous interfaces in being the first to use a computer mouse (or [[trackball]])-based concept,&lt;ref name=jal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/5131947/lexus-reveals-remote-touch-mouse+based-point+and+click-infotainment-system|title=Lexus Reveals "Remote Touch" Mouse-Based, Point-And-Click Infotainment System|publisher= Jalopnik|accessdate=2009-07-23|last= Hardigree|first=Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=techon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20090130/164877/|title=Lexus RX Comes with 'Remote Touch' Haptic Interface|publisher= Tech-On!|accessdate=2009-07-23|last= Hayashi|first= Tatsuhiko|date=2009-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of the rotary knob model.  The system allows the operator to freely move the on-screen cursor across any part of the screen.  The cursor replaces the role of the driver's hand on the previous touchscreen interface.&lt;ref name=techon/&gt;

[[Image:Remote Touch by Lexus kiosk.jpg|thumb|Remote Touch demonstrator at the 2008 Los Angeles Auto Show]]
Remote Touch is also the first vehicle interface to incorporate user-adjustable haptic feedback, and utilize movement in two [[Axis of rotation|spatial axes]].&lt;ref name=int2/&gt; The incorporation of haptic feedback, similar to the [[Wii Remote]],&lt;ref name=mp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherproof.com/car-reviews/new/2010-lexus-rx-450h/interior/|title=Redesigned 2010 Lexus RX 450h Tweaked in All the Right Spots|publisher=MotherProof.com|accessdate=2009-07-23|last=Hindman|first=Lori}}&lt;/ref&gt; enables the driver to feel the placement of buttons and icons on the screen by touch. The use of force feedback enables the cursor to 'snap-to' buttons, making it easier to select buttons without precise movement. To ease drivers' transition to Remote Touch, the same on-screen layout and menus as the prior touchscreen-based system are used on models equipped with the new control system.&lt;ref name=techon/&gt;

The Remote Touch controller, which (including the directional input, buttons, and palmrest) measures {{convert|88|mm|abbr=on}} in width x {{convert|20|mm|abbr=on}} in length, and is {{convert|95|mm|abbr=on}} tall, is placed at the base of the center console.&lt;ref name=techon/&gt; Two large buttons ([[Enter key|Enter]]) on both sides of the controller at thumb level are used to select icons, along with three secondary buttons ([[Map]], [[Scrolling|Scroll]], and [[Display device|Display]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2009/04/30/remote-touch-control-will-debut-in-2010-lexus-rx-450h/|title="Remote Touch control" will debut in 2010 Lexus RX 450h|publisher=Autoblog Green|accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the replacement of the touchscreen, the navigation screen is now recessed and placed closer to eye level on the dashboard. Remote Touch has two [[Electric motor|motor]]s and an [[encoder]], with the motors programmed to reset the controller to a neutral position when the navigation system is activated.&lt;ref name=techon/&gt;

The introduction of Remote Touch on the 2010 Lexus RX was generally well received by reviewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/Lexus_RX-Hybrid/Interior/|title=2010 Lexus RX 450h Interior Review |work= U.S. News and World Report|quote=Test drivers especially like the new Remote Touch controller that comes with the optional navigation system.|accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the system was described as easier to use than rivals by [[Autoblog.com|Autoblog]],&lt;ref name=ab&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2009/01/08/first-drive-2010-lexus-rx350-and-rx450h/|title=First Drive: 2010 Lexus RX350 and RX450h |publisher= Autoblog|accessdate=2009-08-16|last=Lavrinc|first=Damon|date=2009-01-08|quote=Remote Touch takes the iDrive/MMI/COMAND idea to a level that even Grandma with her 386 Pentium can understand.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Car and Driver]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/car/08q4/2010_lexus_rx350_rx450h_hybrid-first_drive_review/more_powerful_than_ever_page_2|title=2010 Lexus RX350 / RX450h Hybrid - More Powerful Than Ever |work= Car and Driver|accessdate=2009-08-16|last=Siler|first=Steve|date=December 2008|quote= [Remote Touch is], we think, one of the greatest—devices we’ve seen yet to simplify operation of the navigation, stereo, and other controls.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cars.com]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cars.com/kickingtires/2009/08/lexus-remote-touch-system-video.html|title=Lexus Remote Touch System Video|publisher=Cars.com|accessdate=2009-08-16|last= Wiesenfelder|first=Joe|date=2009-08-11|quote=the Lexus Remote Touch system is definitely my favorite so far, way better than scrolling through menus with a knob.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNET]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-10138565-48.html|title=Driving impressions: 2010 Lexus RX 350, RX450h |publisher=CNET.com|accessdate=2009-08-16|last=Russ|first=Carey|date=2009-01-04|quote= [Remote Touch] is the polar opposite of the counterintuitive devices found in German luxury cars…no explanation is necessary}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[HowStuffWorks|Consumer Guide]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/deep-drive-2010-lexus-rx.htm|title=Deep Drive: 2010 Lexus RX|work=Consumer Guide|accessdate=2009-08-16|last=Bell|first=Damon|year=2009|quote=we found the Remote Touch system to be very intuitive and much easier to learn and use than similar joystick-control systems in Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz vehicles.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826012653/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/deep-drive-2010-lexus-rx.htm|archivedate=2009-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmunds.com]],&lt;ref name=int2/&gt; ''[[Motor Trend]]'',&lt;ref name=mt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trucktrend.com/roadtests/suv/163_0904_diesel_hybrid_suv_comparison/interior.html|title=SUV Comparison - Truck Trend|work=Motor Trend|accessdate=2009-08-16|last=Loh|first= Edward|date=February 2009|quote= game-changing telematics controller called Remote Touch… “If every vehicle gets something like this in 10 years I won't be surprised.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[PC Magazine]]'',&lt;ref name=pcmag/&gt; ''[[Road &amp; Track]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/article.asp?section_id=10&amp;article_id=7705|title=First Drive: 2010 Lexus RX 350 &amp; RX 450h|work=Road &amp; Track|accessdate=2009-08-16|last=Wilson|first=Tom|date=April 2009|quote=[Remote Touch] is handy and intuitive — two things sadly lacking in other makers' console controllers.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303230052/http://www.roadandtrack.com/article.asp?section_id=10&amp;article_id=7705|archivedate=2009-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Winding Road (magazine)|Winding Road]]'',&lt;ref name=wr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nextautos.com/winding-road-issue-42/drives-2010-lexus-rx|title=Drives: 2010 Lexus RX|work=Winding Road|accessdate=2009-08-16|last=Paukert|first=Chris|quote=...the often-maddening complexity of BMW's iDrive and its German disciples.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12989">[[Thomas P. Hughes]],&lt;ref name="hughes"&gt;Hughes, T. P. (1983). Networks of power: Electrification in western society, 1880-1930. USA: The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in his {{According to whom|seminal book,|date=July 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Kranzberg, "History &amp; Technology: Kranzberg's Laws" ''Society for the History of Technology'', 1986&lt;/ref&gt; ''Networks of power: Electrification in western society, 1880-1930'', introduces the concept in the analysis of technological systems, whereby the reverse salient refers to a component of the system that, due to its insufficient development, prevents the technological system in its entirety achieving its targeted development.

==Technological systems and their evolution==
Technological systems may refer to a [[hierarchy|hierarchically]] nested structure of technological parts, whereby the [[system]] is seen as a composition of [[interdependence|interdependent]] sub-systems that are themselves systems comprising further sub-systems.&lt;ref name="tushman and murmann"&gt;[[Tushman, M.L.]] &amp; Murmann, J.P. 1998, "Dominant Designs, Technology Cycles, and Organizational Outcomes", Research in Organizational Behavior, vol. 20, pp. 231-266.&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner, the holistic system as well as its properties is seen to be [[:wikt:synthesized|synthesized]] through the sub-systems that constitute it. Technological systems may also be seen as [[sociotechnical systems|socio-technical systems]] that contain, in addition to technical sub-systems, social sub-systems, such as the creators and users of [[technology]], as well as overseeing regulatory bodies. In both perspectives, technological systems are seen to be goal-seeking, therefore evolving towards objectives.&lt;ref name="sahal"&gt;Sahal, D. 1981, Patterns of Technological Evolution, Addison-Wesley, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; proposes that technological systems pass through certain phases during the system’s evolution. The first of these phases sees the invention and development of the system, owed greatly to the efforts of inventors and [[entrepreneur]]s, such as [[Thomas Edison]] in the development of the electric technological system. The second stage is the era of technological transfer from one region or society to others, for example, the dissemination of Edison’s electric system from New York City to other cities such as London and Berlin. The third phase of systemic evolution is marked by a period of system growth and expansion when the technological system strives to improve its performance, for instance with respect to economic outcomes or [[Output (economics)|output]] efficiency. In this phase, the system is dependent on the satisfactory evolution of all its components’ performances. The development of the technological systems is therefore reliant on the reciprocated and interdependent cause and effect [[Process (science)|processes]] amongst social and technical components, and may be described as [[coevolution|co-evolutionary]], where the balanced co-evolution of system components carries significance in establishing desired system progress. Subsequently, a sub-system which evolves at a sufficient pace contribute positively to the collective development, while a sub-system which does not develop sufficiently prevents the technology system achieving its targeted development. Hughes names these problematic sub-systems reverse salients.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hughes2"&gt;Hughes, T.P. 1987, "The Evolution of Large Technological Systems" in The Social Construction of Technological Systems, eds. W.E. Bijker, T.P. Hughes &amp; T.P. Pinch, The MIT Press, USA, pp. 51-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse salients in technological system evolution==
A reverse salient is the inverse of a [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] that depicts the forward protrusion along an object’s profile or a line of battle.&lt;ref name="hughes2" /&gt; Hence, reverse salients are the backward projections along similar, continuous lines. The reverse salient subsequently refers to the sub-system that has strayed behind the advancing performance frontier of the system due to its lack of sufficient performance. In turn, the reverse salient hampers the progress or prevents the fulfillment of potential development of the collective system. In line with the socio-technical standpoint, reverse salients can be technical elements such as [[electric motor|motors]] and [[capacitor]]s of an electric system, or social elements such as organizations or productive units.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;

Because reverse salients limit system development, the further development of the system lies in the correction of the reverse salient, where correction is attained through incremental or radical [[innovation]]s. The reverse salient denotes a focusing device, in the words of [[Nathan Rosenberg]],&lt;ref name="rosenberg"&gt;Rosenberg, N. (1969). The direction of technological change: Inducement mechanisms and focusing devices. Economic Development and Cultural Change, 18, 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; for technological system [[Stakeholder theory|stakeholders]], which strive to remove it through innovation. It is possible that the reverse salient is not able to be corrected within the bounds of the existing technological system through [[innovation|incremental innovations]]. Consequently, [[innovation|radical innovations]] may be needed to correct the reverse salient. However, radical innovations can lead to the creation of new and different technological systems, as witnessed in the emergence of the [[alternating current]] system that overcame the problem of low cost electricity distribution, which the [[direct current]] system could not.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;

Hence, the reverse salient is a useful concept for analyzing technological system evolution,&lt;ref name="dedehayir"&gt;Dedehayir, O. 2009, "[http://www.jiem.org/index.php/jiem/article/view/125 Bibliometric study of the reverse salient concept]", ''[[Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management]]'', Vol 2, No 3.&lt;/ref&gt; because often the analysis of technological systems centers on the factors that limit system development. More than technical components, these factors may also be social components. Subsequently, reverse salients may be more applicable in certain contexts to denote system performance hindrance than similar or overlapping concepts such as [[wikt:bottleneck|bottleneck]] and technological imbalance or disequilibrium.&lt;ref name="rosenberg2"&gt;Rosenberg, N. (1976). Perspectives on technology. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reverse salient refers to an ''extremely complex situation in which individuals, groups, material forces, historical influences, and other factors have idiosyncratic, causal forces, and in which accidents as well as trends play a part. On the contrary, the disequilibrium concept suggests a relatively straightforward abstraction of physical science''.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; Additionally, while the reverse salient and bottleneck concepts share similarities and have been used interchangeably in particular contexts, the reverse salient often refers to the sub-system that not only curbs the performance or output of the collective system but also requires correction because of its limiting affect. This is not necessarily the case with bottlenecks, which are ''geometrically too symmetrical''&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; and therefore do not represent the complexity of system evolution. For instance, a particular system’s output performance may be compromised due to a bottleneck sub-system but the bottleneck will not require improvement if the system’s present output performance is satisfactory. If, on the other hand, a higher level of performance would be required of the same system, the bottleneck may emerge as a reverse salient that holds the system back from attaining that higher output performance.

==Reverse salient examples==
While numerous studies illustrate technological systems that have been hampered by reverse salients, the most seminal work in this field of study is that of Hughes,&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; who gives a historical account of the development of Edison’s direct-current electric system. In order to supply electricity within a defined region of distribution, sub-systems such as the [[Electrical generator|direct current generator]] were identified as reverse salients and corrected. The most notable limitation of the direct-current system was, however, its low voltage transmission distance, and the resulting cost of distributing electricity beyond a certain range. To reduce costs, Edison introduced a three-wire system to replace the previously installed two-wire alternative and trialed different configuration of generators, as well as the usage of storage batteries. These improvements however did not correct the reverse salient completely. The satisfactory resolution of the problem was eventually provided by the radical innovation of the alternating current system.

Since Hughes' seminal work, other authors have also provided examples of reverse salients in different technological systems. In the [[ballistic missile]] technological development, where the systemic objective has been to increase missile accuracy, [[Donald Angus MacKenzie|MacKenzie]]&lt;ref name="mackenzie"&gt;MacKenzie, D. (1987). Missile accuracy: A case study in the social processes of technological change. In W. E. Bijker, T. P. Hughes &amp; T. J. Pinch (Eds.), The social construction of technological systems (pp. 195-222). USA: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; has identified the [[gyroscope]] sub-system as a technical reverse salient. Takeishi and Lee&lt;ref name="takeishi"&gt;Takeishi, A., &amp; Lee, K. (2005). Mobile music business in japan and korea: Copyright management institutions as a reverse salient. Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 14, 291-306.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that [[copyright|music copyright]] managing institutions have acted as a social reverse salient in the evolution of the [[mobile music]] technology system in Japan and Korea, where the objective was to proliferate mobile music throughout the end-user market. And further, Mulder and Knot,&lt;ref name="mulder"&gt;Mulder, K., &amp; Knot, M. (2001). PVC plastic: A history of systems development and entrenchment. Technology in Society, 23, 265-286.&lt;/ref&gt; see the development of the PVC ([[polyvinyl chloride]]) plastic technology system to have been sequentially hampered by several states of reverse salience, including: difficulty to process PVC material, quality of manufactured products, health concerns for individuals exposed to effluent from PVC manufacturing facilities, and finally the [[carcinogen]]ic nature of vinyl chloride.

==Analytical measure of reverse salience==
The magnitude of reverse salience emerges as an informative [[parameter]] in technological systems analysis as it signifies not only the technological disparity between sub-systems but also the entire system’s limited level of performance. Notwithstanding its importance, the literature studying technological system evolution has remained limited in terms of analytical tools that measure the state of reverse salience. Dedehayir and Mäkinen&lt;ref name="dedehayir makinen"&gt;[http://www.jotmi.org/index.php/GT/article/view/art87/158 Dedehayir, O. &amp; Mäkinen, S.J. 2008, "Dynamics of Reverse Salience as Technological Performance Gap: An Empirical Study of the Personal Computer Technology System", Journal of Technology Management and Innovation, vol. 3, no. 3, pp. 55-66.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="citer"&gt;[http://tta.mediacabinet.fi/en/research/citer/?id=82 CITER]&lt;/ref&gt; have subsequently proposed an [[Absolute value|absolute]] ''[http://www.jotmi.org/index.php/GT/article/view/art87/158 performance gap]'' measure of reverse salience magnitude. This measure evaluates the technological performance differential between the salient sub-system (i.e. the advanced sub-system) and the reverse salient sub-system at a particular point in time. In turn, by evaluating a series of performance differentials over time, the performance gap measure helps reflect the dynamics of change in the evolving technological system through changing reverse salience magnitude.

==Origin of term==
According to Thomas Hughes, the  name "reverse salient" was inspired by the Verdun [[Salient (military)|salient]] during the [[Battle of Verdun]], which he claimed his history professor in college referred to as a "reverse salient". He described it as a backward bulge in the advancing line of a [[military front]].&lt;ref name="American Heritage"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1985/6/1985_6_65.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the same as a [[Salient (military)|salient]]; moreover, "reverse salient" is not a military term in general usage.

[[Image:IncunabulumDetail.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Detail from a rare [[Blackletter]] [[Bible]] (1497) printed and rubricated in [[Strasbourg]] by [[Johann Grüninger]].]]
'''Rubrication''' was one of several steps in the [[medieval]] process of [[manuscript]] making. Practitioners of rubrication, so-called ''rubricators'', were specialized [[scribe]]s who received text from the manuscript's original scribe and supplemented it with additional text in red [[ink]] for emphasis. The term ''rubrication'' comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''rubrico'', "to color red".

== History ==
The practice usually entailed the addition of red headings to mark the end of one section of text and the beginning of another. Such headings were sometimes used to introduce the subject of the following section or to declare its purpose and function. Rubrication was used so often in this regard that the term ''[[rubric]]'' was commonly used as a generic term for headers of any type or color, though it technically referred only to headers to which red ink had been added. In liturgical books such as [[missal]]s, red may also be used to give the actions to be performed by the celebrant or others, leaving the texts to be read in black. Important feasts in liturgical calendars were also often rubricated,{{Sfn | Clemens | Graham | 2007 | pp = 24–25}} and rubrication can indicate how scribes viewed the importance of different parts of their text.

Rubrication may also be used to emphasize the starting [[grapheme |character]] of a [[canto]] or other division of text; this was often important because manuscripts often consist of multiple works in a single bound volume. This particular type of rubrication is similar to flourishing, wherein red ink is used to style a leading character with artistic loops and swirls. However, this process is far less elaborate than [[illumination (manuscript) |illumination]], in which detailed pictures are incorporated into the manuscript often set in thin sheets of [[gold]] to give the appearance of [[light]] within the text.

Quite commonly the manuscript's initial scribe would provide notes to the rubricator in the form of [[annotation]]s made in the [[Margin (typography) |margins]] of the text. Such notes were effectively indications to "rubricate here" or "add rubric". In many other cases, the initial scribe also held the position of rubricator, and so he applied rubrication as needed without the use of annotations. This is important, as a scribe's annotations to the rubricator can be used along with [[codicology]] to establish a manuscript's history, or [[provenance]].

Later medieval practitioners extended the practice of rubrication to include the use of other colors of ink besides red. Most often, alternative colors included blue and green. After the introduction of [[movable type]] printing, readers continued to expect rubrication, which might be done by hand, if there were few rubrics to add, or by a separate print using a red-ink form, later the normal method. The "great majority of [[incunable]]s did not issue from the press in a finished state… hardly any incunable was considered 'finished' by its printer…", suggesting that hand rubrication provided a sense of legitimacy to the efforts of early printers and their works.  This fact, the notion that something about hand written rubrication completes a printed work by attributing to it a sense of legitimacy and finality, is further supported by the fact that red ink "was not merely decorative… red's original function was to articulate the text by indicating such parts as headings that were so essential to the function of manuscripts that the printers had to deal with them in some way".{{Sfn |  Smith | 1994 | p = 34}}

==Uses==
The title "generally was written in one or more lines that the scribe of the text had left blank to receive the title", showing both the importance of the section and the knowledge one may gain from this process.{{Sfn | Clemens | Graham | 2007 |  pp = 24–25}}  As mentioned above, the initial scribe of a text often left notes for the rubricator of where rubrication would be necessary, a fact that helps the modern historian learn of the [[provenance]] of the manuscript. Rubrication affected how later generations read and interpreted a text, and this process helped ensure editorial standardization throughout Western Europe.

==Ink==
The recipe for the red ink is given in [[Theophilus Presbyter |Theophilus]]' ''[[De diversis artibus]]'':
{{Quote |
To prepare white-flake, get some sheets of lead beaten out thin, place them dry in a hollow piece of wood and pour in some warm vinegar or urine to cover them. Then, after a month, take off the
cover and remove whatever white there is, and again replace it as at first.  When you have a sufficient amount and you wish to make
red lead from it, grind this flake-white on a stone without water, then put it in two or three new pots and place it over a burning fire.  You have a slender curved iron rod, fitted at one end in a wooden handle and broad at the top, and with this you can stir and mix this flake-white from time to time. You do this for a long time until the red lead becomes visible.{{Sfn |  Smith | 1994 | p = 34}}}}

The process took a long time to complete, but was cheap and used common materials.  The white material is [[White lead |lead carbonate]] and the red material is [[lead(II,IV) oxide]].

The '''S-procedure''' or '''S-lemma''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] result that gives conditions under which a particular quadratic inequality is a consequence of another quadratic inequality. The S-procedure was developed independently in a number of different contexts&lt;ref&gt;Frank Uhlig, ''[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0024-3795(79)90020-X A recurring theorem about pairs of quadratic forms and extensions: a survey]'', Linear Algebra and its Applications, Volume 25, 1979, pages 219–237.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Imre Pólik and Tamás Terlaky, ''[https://dx.doi.org/10.1137/S003614450444614X A Survey of the S-Lemma]'', SIAM Review, Volume 49, 2007, Pages 371–418.&lt;/ref&gt; and has applications in [[control theory]], [[linear algebra]] and [[mathematical optimization]].

== Statement of the S-procedure == 
Let F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be symmetric matrices, g&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and g&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be vectors and h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be real numbers. Assume that there is some x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that the strict inequality &lt;math&gt;x_0^T F_1 x_0 + 2g_1^T x_0 + h_1 &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; holds. Then the implication 
::&lt;math&gt;x^T F_1 x + 2g_1^T x + h_1 \le 0 \Longrightarrow x^T F_2 x + 2g_2^T x + h_2 \le 0&lt;/math&gt;
holds if and only if there exists some nonnegative number λ such that 
::&lt;math&gt; \lambda \begin{bmatrix} F_1 &amp; g_1 \\ g_1^T &amp; h_1 \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix} F_2 &amp; g_2 \\ g_2^T &amp; h_2 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; 
is [[positive semidefinite matrix|positive semidefinite]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe ''[http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf Convex Optimization]'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, p.655.&lt;/ref&gt;

SRM is particular useful in the context of engine modelling &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kraft|first1=M|last2=Maigaard|first2=P|last3=Mauss|first3=F|last4=Christensen|first4=M|last5=Johansson|first5=B|title=Investigation of combustion emissions in a homogeneous charge compression injection engine: Measurements and a new computational model|journal=Proceedings of the Combustion Institute|date=2000|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1195–1201|doi=10.1016/S0082-0784(00)80330-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
as the dynamics of the particle ensemble includes detailed [[chemical kinetics]]  whilst accounting for inhomogeneity in composition and [[temperature]] space arising from on-going [[fuel injection]], [[heat transfer]] and [[turbulence]] mixing events.  Through this coupling, heat release profiles and in particular the associated [[exhaust gas]] emissions ([[Particulates]], [[NOx]], [[Carbon monoxide]], [[uHCs|Unburned hydrocarbon]] ''etc''.) can be predicted more accurately than if using the more conventional approaches of standard homogenous and multi-zone reactor methods.&lt;ref name="Coble" /&gt;

==Coupling with third party software tools ==

The software can be coupled as a plug-in into 1D engine cycle software tools,&lt;ref name="Coble" /&gt; are capable of simulating the combustion and emissions during closed volume period of the cycle ([[combustion]], TDC and negative valve overlap).

An advanced [[Application programming interface]] enables for the model to be coupled with a user-defined codes such as 3D-CFD &lt;ref name="Char"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Cao| year = 2009 | title = Influence of Injection Timing and Piston Bowl Geometry on PCCI Combustion and Emissions | journal = SAE Technical Paper  | volume = 2 | pages = 1019–1033 | id = SAE 2009-01-1102 | doi= 10.4271/2009-01-1102| url = http://papers.sae.org/2009-01-1102/|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; or control &lt;ref name="h2" /&gt; software.

The group '''Science, Reason and Faith''' ('''CRYF''', standing for '''Ciencia, Razón y Fe''' in Spanish) is formed by teachers at the [[University of Navarra]]. Its purpose is to promote the interdisciplinary study of issues related to science, philosophy and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Udías Vallina, Agustín (2010). Ciencia y religión: dos visiones del mundo. Sal Terrae. p. 16. (In Spanish.)&lt;/ref&gt; The activities of the group cover three closely related areas: research, teaching and public engagement.

==History of the group==
The beginning of the CRYF group dates back to the informal conversations that, at the end of the 20th century, professors [[Mariano Artigas]] († 2006) and [[Carlos Pérez (academic)|Carlos Pérez]] († 2005) maintained about interdisciplinary questions and public debates concerning the relationship between science and faith.

In 2002, circumstances were favorable for the creation of the group. Its founding members were professors Mariano Artigas, Juan Luis Lorda, Antonio Pardo, Carlos Perez, Francisco Gallardo and Santiago Collado. Since its inception, in addition to other teachers from the University of Navarra, the group has incorporated prestigious intellectuals and experts on the topics of interest as collaborating members: Evandro Agazzi, William Shea, Juan Arana and Tito Arecchi are some of the present collaborators.

Professor Artigas was appointed the first director of the group, a position he held until his death. The contribution of his intellectual output, which the group has inherited as his legacy, could be summarized as having contributed to unify and highlight the relationship between science and religion. In this endeavor, it is important not to reduce thought to mere scientific rationality, where science is understood as empirical or experimental science. The name of the group expresses this conviction: science, reason and faith. The CRYF is currently considered one of the centers that has contributed most to explore the common ground shared by science, philosophy and theology in southern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oviedo|first1=Lluis|last2=Garre|first2=Álvaro|title=The Interaction between Religion and Science in Catholic Southern Europe (Italy, Spain and Portugal)|journal=Zygon L|date=2015|volume=1|pages=172-193|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/zygo.12159/full|archivedate=11 February 2017|deadurl=yes|df=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211075232/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/zygo.12159/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The CRYF has received funding from the [[Templeton Foundation]] twice. In 2006, for the project entitled "The Human Singularity: The Origin, Nature, and Destiny of the Human Being" and in 2011, in order to set up the "Mariano Artigas Memorial Lectures".&lt;ref&gt;José M. Gimenez-Amaya - Santiago Collado (2011-2014). «Mariano Artigas Memorial Lecture (MAML)». &lt;/ref&gt;  The Mariano Artigas Lectures are held every two years in October and have a two-fold purpose: to honor the figure of Professor Artigas and to recognize the work done by the invited lecturer in the field of the relations between science and religion. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Science, Reason and Faith Group|first1=|last2=John Templeton Foundation|first2=|title=Mariano Artigas Memorial Lecture|date=2011-2017|publisher=[[John Templeton Foundation]] |isbn=|url=http://www.unav.edu/web/ciencia-razon-y-fe/mariano-artigas-memorial-lecture|language=English|ref=harv}}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous speakers have been William Shea in 2011, Karl Giberson in 2013 and Giuseppe Tanzella-Nitti in 2015. In 2017, the Lecture was entrusted to Spanish philosopher Juan Arana.

At the beginning of 2007, after the death of Mariano Artigas, the professor of Physics, [[Héctor Mancini]] replaced him as head of the group until the beginning of 2010. During the period 2010-2016 the director was the [[neuroscientist]], philosopher and priest [[José Manuel Giménez Amaya]]. Since the beginning of 2016, this position is held by the physicist, theologian and priest [[Javier Sánchez Cañizares]].

==Interests and objectives==
Broadly speaking, the CRYF group is interested in discussing the big issues from the perspective of the dialogue between science, reason and faith. Specifically, the main topics of interest are the following:
* [[Origin of man]], [[origin of life]] and [[origin of the universe]]
* Nature and causes of [[evolution]]
* [[Mind#Relation to the brain|Mind-brain relationship]]
* Relations between science and truth
* Relations between science and religion
* Order, [[complexity]] and [[purpose]]
* Classic [[science-faith debates]] ([[Galileo case]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Artigas|first1=Mariano|last2=Shea|first2=William R.|title=Galileo Observed. Science and the Politics of Belief|date=2006|publisher=Science History Publications|isbn=9780881353563|url=|language=English|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and current ones ([[creationism]] and [[evolutionism]])
More specific goals of the group are: to promote among its members research and publications on the topics of interest; to develop lessons and teaching materials for intra- and extra-mural education; to make available, through the Internet, an archive of documents on the areas of interest that could be useful as teaching material and for outreach activities; and to promote the organization of activities, collaborations and scientific meetings that can help achieve the goals of the group.

==Activities and some outcomes==
The CRYF group organizes monthly open seminars with invited speakers, followed by a discussion in which academics from various areas of expertise (such as theology, physics, medicine, philosophy and biology) exchange ideas and opinions. These seminars may also have the format of a round table or a workshop, and they are uploaded to the YouTube channel of the University of Navarra. One activity that deserves special mention was the workshop organized by the CRYF in collaboration with the "Thomas More Institute"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.netherhall.org.uk/node/53|title=Thomas More Institute|publisher=Netherhall Educational Association|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of London in 2009, to study the contributions of Mariano Artigas. The presentations of that meeting were later collected and published in the book "Science and Faith Within Reason". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Navarro|first1=Jaume|title=Science and Faith within Reason: Reality, Creation, Life and Design|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781138268630|url=https://www.routledge.com/Science-and-Faith-within-Reason-Reality-Creation-Life-and-Design/Navarro/p/book/9781409426080|language=English|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In collaboration with the [[Nicolaus Copernicus University]] of Torun (Poland), the CRYF group publishes the interdisciplinary scientific journal "Scientia et Fides" twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apcz.umk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/SetF/index|title=Scientia et Fides|publisher=Wydział Teologiczny UMK|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This peer-reviewed open-access magazine publishes original articles addressing in a rigorous way the relationships between science and religion from different perspectives. The second issue of 2016 was a special number commemorating the tenth anniversary of the death of Mariano Artigas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=|first1=|title=10th anniversary of Mariano Artigas' death|journal=Scientia et Fides|date=2016|volume=IV (2)|pages=538|url=http://apcz.umk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/SetF/issue/view/981|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to teaching, the CRYF group teaches three courses on issues related to science and religion at the University of Navarra. It also collaborates regularly with the Higher Institute of Religious Sciences of the same University. The members of the CRYF are available to give seminars or conferences on the topics of interest to any institution requesting it. Several schools, cultural foundations and universities across Spain, Europe and Latin America have already benefited from this collaboration.

A '''shell grotto''' is a type of [[folly]], a [[grotto]] decorated with [[sea shell]]s.

==History==
The shell grotto was a popular feature of British country house in the 17th and 18th centuries.
It arose from the influence of the [[Rococo style]] (which used swirling motifs similar to sea shells)&lt;ref name=HJ&gt;Hazelle Jackson, ''Shell Houses and Grottoes'' ( 2001) {{ISBN|9780747805229}} ([http://www.londongardenstrust.org/features/grotto.htm abstract])&lt;/ref&gt;
and mimicry of architectural features from the [[Italian renaissance]] (themselves copies from Classical times).
The idea of a grotto was originally a means to enhance a dank [[undercroft]], or provide an antechamber before a ''[[piano nobile]]'', but later became a garden feature independent of the house.
Early grottos were mainly of the shell grotto type, mimicking a sea-cave, or in the form of a [[nymphaeum]]; later there was a move towards more naturalistic cave-like grottoes.&lt;ref name=HJ/&gt; 

The first recorded shell grotto in England was at [[Whitehall Palace]]; [[James VI and I|James I]] had it built in the undercroft of the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall|Banqueting House]] in 1624, but it hasn't survived. Two years later the [[Duke of Bedford]] had a shell room built at [[Woburn Abbey]], featuring shell mosaics and carved stone.
This, and another at [[Skipton Castle]], built in 1627, are the only surviving examples from the 17th century.&lt;ref name=HJ/&gt; 

Shell grottoes were an expensive luxury: The grotto at [[Oatlands Park]] cost £25,000 in 1781 and took 11 years to build; and at [[Fisherwick|Fisherwick Park]] the [[Marquess of Donegall]] spent £10,000 on shells alone in 1789.&lt;ref name=Tat&gt;[https://www.tatler.com/article/the-poshest-grottoes  ''The 4 poshest garden grottoes''] [[Tatler]] 27 July 2015; retrieved 30 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shell Grotto, Margate|The Grotto]] at [[Margate]] has 2000 square feet of mosaic, using some 4.6 million shells.

By the end of the 18th century fashion had moved on to more naturalistic cave-like structures, before falling out of favour altogether. Many were demolished or have fallen into disrepair, but 
some 200 grottos of all types are known to have survived in some form in the UK.&lt;ref name=HJ/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2581">The '''Social Science Genetic Association Consortium''', abbreviated '''SSGAC''', is a consortium of scientists dedicated to studying the role of [[genetics]] in important life outcomes in the [[social science]]s. It has received media coverage for its research looking for [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|genetic variant]]s associated with [[educational attainment]].&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/science/genes-education.html |title=Years of Education Influenced by Genetic Makeup, Enormous Study Finds |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |date=2018-07-23 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-09-26 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the Consortium's first study, published in 2013, found three such variants in a sample of 101,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/05/the-genetics-of-staying-in-school/482052/ |title=The Genetics of Staying in School |last=Yong |first=Ed |date=2016-05-11 |website=The Atlantic |language=en-US |access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SSGAC was founded by Daniel Benjamin ([[University of Southern California]]), David Cesarini ([[New York University]]), and Philipp Koellinger ([[VU Amsterdam]]).&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/story/are-diplomas-in-your-dna/ |title=Are Diplomas in Your DNA? |last=Molteni |first=Megan |date=2018-07-31 |website=WIRED |language=en-US |access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Benjamin, "One major impetus for the formation of the SSGAC was the growing recognition that most effects of individual genetic markers on behavioral traits are very small and that, consequently, very large samples are required to accurately detect them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2013/05/genetic-variants-linked-educational-attainment |title=Genetic variants linked to educational attainment  |last=Kelley |first=Susan |date=2013-05-30 |website=Cornell Chronicle |language=en |access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded during a meeting of the CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) consortium on February 12, 2011.

{{Sex and the Law}}
A '''sodomy law''' is a law that defines certain [[Human sexual activity|sexual acts]] as [[Sex and the law|crimes]]. The precise sexual acts meant by the term ''[[sodomy]]'' are rarely spelled out in the law, but are typically understood by courts to include any sexual act deemed to be "unnatural" or immoral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Weeks | first = Jeff | title =Sex, Politics and Society: The Regulation of Sexuality Since 1800 | publisher = Longman Publishing Group |date=January 1981 | location = London | isbn = 0-582-48334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sodomy typically includes [[anal sex]], [[oral sex]], and [[zoophilia|bestiality]].&lt;ref name="Phelps"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shirelle Phelps|title=World of Criminal Justice: N-Z|publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale Group]]|year=2001|page=686|isbn =0787650730|accessdate=January 13, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/?id=izwvAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=World+of+Criminal+Justice:+N-Z.&amp;dq=World+of+Criminal+Justice:+N-Z.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheb"&gt;{{cite book|authors=John Scheb, John Scheb, II|title=Criminal Law and Procedure|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2013|page=185|isbn =128554613X|accessdate=January 13, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VZoWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Newton|title=Gay and Lesbian Rights: A Reference Handbook, Second Edition|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2009|page=85|isbn =1598843079|accessdate=January 13, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gjcUFK4RZNcC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, sodomy laws have rarely been enforced against [[heterosexual]] couples, and have mostly been used to target [[homosexuals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/unnatural-law| title=Unnatural Law |last=Sullivan |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Sullivan |date=2003-03-24 |work=The New Republic |accessdate=2009-11-27 |quote=Since the laws had rarely been enforced against heterosexuals, there was no sense of urgency about their repeal.}} (Or {{cite journal |last=Sullivan |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Sullivan|title=Unnatural Law |journal=The New Republic |volume=228 |issue=11 |date=2003-03-24}})&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2016, 72 countries as well as five sub-national jurisdictions{{efn| These five sub-national jurisdictions are: the provinces of Aceh and South Sumatra (Indonesia), the Cook Islands (New Zealand), Gaza (Palestine) and Marawi City (the Philippines).}} have laws criminalizing homosexuality,&lt;ref name="ILGA"/&gt; with most of them located in the [[Muslim world]]. In 2006 that number was 92.&lt;ref name="ILGA"/&gt;
In 2011, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] passed an [[LGBT rights]] resolution, which was followed up by a report published by the UN Human Rights Commissioner which included scrutinisation of the mentioned codes.

===Criminalization===
The Middle [[Assyria]]n Law Codes (1075 BC) state: If a man has intercourse with his brother-in-arms, they shall turn him into a [[eunuch]]. This is the earliest known law condemning the act of male-to-male intercourse in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/1075assyriancode.html|title=The Code of the Assura, c. 1075 BCE|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Republic]], the ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' imposed penalties on those who committed a sex crime ''([[stuprum]])'' against a [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|freeborn male minor]]. The law may also have been used to prosecute male citizens who willingly played the [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|passive role in same-sex acts]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), pp. 140–141; Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), pp. 86, 224; John Boswell, ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century'' (University of Chicago Press, 1980), pp. 63, 67–68; Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The law was mentioned in literary sources but enforced infrequently; [[Domitian]] revived it during his program of judicial and moral reform.&lt;ref&gt;James L. Butrica, "Some Myths and Anomalies in the Study of Roman Sexuality," in ''Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition'' (Haworth Press, 2005), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether the penalty was death or a fine. For [[Male sexuality in ancient Rome|adult male citizens]] to experience and act on homoerotic desire was considered natural and permissible, as long as their partner was a male [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|of lower social standing]].&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), p. 225, and "Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the ''cinaedus'' and the Roman Law against Love between Men," ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' 3.4 (1993), p. 525.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pederasty in ancient Rome]] was acceptable only when the younger partner was a [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitute]] or [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slave]].

Most sodomy related laws in [[Western civilization]] originated from the growth of Christianity during [[Late Antiquity]].&lt;ref name="Gaylaw"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=BZTnDgeygHkC&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=history%20of%20sodomy%20laws%20Christianity&amp;pg=PA161#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20sodomy%20laws%20Christianity&amp;f=false | title=Gaylaw: Challenging the Apartheid of the Closet | publisher=Harvard University Press | author=Eskridge, William N. | year=2009 | page=161| isbn=9780674036581 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that today some [[LGBT-affirming Christian denominations|Christian denominations]] allow [[gay marriage]] and the ordination of [[Ordination of LGBT Christian clergy|gay clergy]].&lt;ref name="GayChurch"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gaychurch.org/affirming-denominations/ | title=Affirming Denominations | accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 12th Century, the Roman Catholic Church launched a massive campaign against sodomites, especially homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ha9GgWNmy0C&amp;pg=PA372&amp;lpg=PA372&amp;dq=fourth%20lateran%20council%20homosexuality&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MLMEl8q-Gm&amp;sig=F6FJzjwOj8hpSANdMT1Hil77MKw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx4K6N-qvQAhUKK8AKHZvRDjUQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=fourth%20lateran%20council%20homosexuality&amp;f=false|title=The Origins and Role of Same-Sex Relations in Human Societies|first=James|last=Neill|date=27 October 2008|publisher=McFarland|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between the years 1250 and 1300, homosexual activity was radically criminalized in most of Europe, even punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;John Boswell, Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality (1980) p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] introduced the first legislation under English criminal law against sodomy with the [[Buggery Act of 1533]], making [[buggery]] punishable by [[hanging]], a penalty not lifted until 1861.

Following Sir [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch15.htm|work=Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England|title=Book the Fourth – Chapter the Fifteenth: Of Offences Against the Persons of Individuals|accessdate=2006-08-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907230432/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch15.htm|archivedate=7 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the crime of sodomy has often been defined only as the "abominable and detestable crime against nature", or some variation of the phrase.  This language led to widely varying rulings about what specific acts were encompassed by its prohibition.

===Decriminalization===
In 1786 [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Pietro Leopoldo of Tuscany]], abolishing [[death penalty]] for all crimes, became not only the first Western ruler to do so, but also the first ruler to abolish death penalty for sodomy (which was replaced by prison and hard labour).

In [[France]], it was the French Revolutionary penal code (issued in 1791) which for the first time struck down "sodomy" as a crime, decriminalizing it together with all "victimless-crimes" (sodomy, heresy, witchcraft, blasphemy), according with the concept that if there was no victim, there was no crime. The same principle was held true in the [[French Penal Code of 1810|Napoleon Penal Code]] in 1810, which was imposed on the large part of Europe then ruled by the [[French Empire (1804–1815)|French Empire]] and its cognate kings, thus decriminalizing sodomy in most of Continental Europe.

In 1830, Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil]] signed a law into the Imperial Penal Code. It eliminates all references to sodomy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brazzil.com/blamar00.htm ''Beyond Carnival'']. Green, James. [[The University of Chicago Press]]. 1999. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Ottoman Empire]], homosexuality was decriminalized in 1858 as part of wider reforms during the [[Tanzimat]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faith-matters.org/images/stories/fm-publications/the-tanzimat-final-web.pdf|title=The Tanzimat: Secular Reforms in the Ottoman Empire|author=Ishtiaq Hussain|publisher=Faith Matters|date=15 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-25927595 |title=Where is it illegal to be gay? |accessdate=25 January 2015 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The death penalty was not lifted in England and Wales until 1861.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In 1917, following the Bolshevik Revolution led by [[V.I. Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Russia]] legalized homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hazard |first1=John N. |title=Unity and Diversity in Socialist Law |journal=Law and Contemporary Problems |publisher=Duke Law |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=270–290 |url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3056&amp;context=lcp |accessdate=21 Jan 2015 |doi=10.2307/1190515 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when [[Joseph Stalin]] came to power in 1920's, these laws were reversed until homosexuality was effectively made illegal again by the government.&lt;ref&gt;West, Green. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AwD3FNUJjXwC&amp;pg=PA223#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Sociolegal Control of Homosexuality: A Multi-Nation Comparison'']. p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Soviet legislation does not recognize so-called crimes against morality. Our laws proceed from the principle of protection of society and therefore countenance punishment only in those instances when juveniles and minors are the objects of homosexual interest ... while recognizing the incorrectness of homosexual development ... our society combines prophylactic and other therapeutic measures with all the necessary conditions for making the conflicts that afflict homosexuals as painless as possible and for resolving their typical estrangement from society within the collective
:—Sereisky, ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia'', 1930, p. 593&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]] (1918–1938), there was a movement to repeal sodomy laws. It has been claimed that this was the first campaign to repeal anti-gay laws that was spearheaded primarily by heterosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Himl |first1=Pavel |title=Oponentský posudek rigorózní práce Jana Seidla „Úsilí o odtrestnění homosexuality za první republiky“ |url=https://is.muni.cz/th/64594/ff_r/hi_seidl_himl.txt |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publishing of the [[Wolfenden report]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], which asserted that "homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence", many western governments, including many U.S. states, have repealed laws specifically against homosexual acts. However by 2003, 13 U.S. states still criminalized homosexuality, along with many Missouri counties, and the territory of Puerto Rico, but in June 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' that [[U.S. state|state]] laws criminalizing private, non-commercial sexual activity between consenting adults at home on the grounds of morality are unconstitutional since there is insufficient justification for intruding into people's liberty and privacy.

As of 2018, sodomy related laws have been repealed or judicially struck down in all of Europe, North America, and South America, except for Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

There have never been Western-style sodomy related laws in the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, North Korea, South Korea, or Vietnam. Additionally, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were part of the French colony of [[French Indochina|'Indochine']]; so if there had been any laws against male homosexual acts in those countries, they would have been dismantled by French colonial authorities, since male homosexual acts have been legal in France and throughout the French Empire since the issuing of the aforementioned French Revolutionary penal code in 1791.

===Criminalization in modern days===
This trend among Western nations has not been followed in all other regions of the world (Africa, some parts of Asia, Oceania and even western countries in the Caribbean Islands), where sodomy often remains a serious crime. For example, male homosexual acts, at least in theory, can result in life imprisonment in Barbados and Guyana.

In Africa, male homosexual acts remain punishable by death in Mauritania, Sudan, and some parts of Nigeria and Somalia.  Male and sometimes female homosexual acts are minor to major criminal offences in many other African countries; for example, life imprisonment is a prospective penalty in Sierra Leone, Tanzania and Uganda. A notable exception is South Africa, where same-sex marriage is legal.

In Asia, male homosexual acts remain punishable by death in Brunei, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Additionally, life imprisonment is the formal penalty for male homosexual acts in Bangladesh, the Maldives, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Qatar. But anti-sodomy laws have been repealed in Israel (which recognises but does not perform same-sex marriages), Japan, Kazakhstan, the Philippines, and Thailand.

== Sodomy-related legal positions by country ==

=== Australia ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Australia}}

Upon colonisation in 1788, Australia inherited laws from the United Kingdom including the [[Buggery Act]] of 1533.  These were retained in the criminal codes passed by the various colonial parliaments during the 19th century, and by the state parliaments after [[Federation]].&lt;ref name=carbery&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carbery |first=Graham |title=Towards Homosexual Equality in Australian Criminal Law: A Brief History |year=2010 |edition=2nd |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.alga.org.au/files/towardsequality2ed.pdf |publisher=Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Wolfenden report]], the [[Don Dunstan|Dunstan]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government introduced a ''consenting adults in private'' type legal defence in South Australia in 1972. This defence was initiated as a bill by Murray Hill, father of former [[Defence Minister]] [[Robert Hill (Australian politician)|Robert Hill]], and repealed the state's sodomy law in 1975.  The [[Campaign Against Moral Persecution]] during the 1970s raised the profile and acceptance of Australia's gay and lesbian communities, and other states and territories repealed their laws between 1976 and 1990. The exception was [[Tasmania]], which retained its laws until the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]] and the United Nations [[Human Rights Committee]] forced their repeal in 1997.

Male homosexuality was decriminalised in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] in 1976, then [[Norfolk Island]] in 1993, following South Australia in 1975 and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1981. At the time of legalization (for the above), the age of consent, rape, defences, etc. were all set gender-neutral and equal {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}. Western Australia legalised male homosexuality in 1989 – Under the ''Law Reform (Decriminalization of Sodomy) Act 1989'', as did [[New South Wales]] and the [[Northern Territory]] in 1984 with unequal ages of consent of 18 for [[New South Wales]] and the [[Northern Territory]] and 21 for Western Australia. Then since 1997, the states and territories that retained different ages of consent or other vestiges of sodomy laws have tended to repeal them later; Western Australia did so in 2002, and [[New South Wales]] and the [[Northern Territory]] did so in 2003. [[Tasmania]] was the last state to decriminalise sodomy, doing so in 1997 after the groundbreaking cases of [[Toonen v Australia]] and [[Croome v Tasmania]] (it is also notable that Tasmania was the first jurisdiction to recognize same-sex couples in Australia since 2004 under the ''Relationships Act 2003''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/tas/consol_act/ra2003173/|title=RELATIONSHIPS ACT 2003|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) In 2016 Queensland became the final Australian jurisdiction to equalise its [[age of consent]] for all forms of sexual activity at 16 years, after reducing the age of consent for [[anal sex]] from 18 years.&lt;ref name="archaic-end"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burke|first1=Gail|title=Queensland lowers anal sex consent age to 16, ending 'archaic' law|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-15/queensland-standardises-age-of-consent-laws-anal-sex/7850112|accessdate=17 September 2016|work=ABC News|agency=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=15 September 2016|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Brazil|Legal status of homosexuality in Brazil}}
Brazilian criminal law does not punish any sexual act performed by consenting adults, but allows for prosecution, under statutory rape laws, when one of the participants is under 14 years of age and the other an adult, as per Articles 217-A of the Brazilian Penal Code. Pedophilic acts are also criminalized by the Children and Teenager Statute, in articles 241-A to 241-E.
Article 235 of the Brazilian Military Criminal Code – DL 1.001/69-, however, does incriminate any contact deemed to be libidinous,  be it of a homosexual nature or not, made in any location subject to military administration. Since the article is entitled ''Of pederasty or other libidinous acts'', gay rights advocates claim that, since the Brazilian armed forces are composed almost exclusively of males,  the article allows for witch-hunts against homosexuals in the military service. This article of the Military Criminal Code is under scrutiny by the Brazilian Supreme Court (ADPF 291).

=== Canada ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Canada}}
Before 1859, the [[Province of Canada]] prosecuted sodomy under the English Buggery Act.  In 1859, the Province of Canada enacted its own [[buggery]] law in the Consolidated Statutes of Canada as an offence punishable by death.  Buggery remained punishable by death until 1869.  A broader law targeting all homosexual male sexual activity ("gross indecency") was passed in 1892, as part of a larger update to the criminal law of the new dominion of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code, 1892, SC 1892, c 29&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes to the ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]'' in 1948 and 1961 were used to brand gay men as "criminal sexual psychopaths" and "dangerous sexual offenders."  These labels provided for indeterminate prison sentences.  Most famously, [[George Klippert]], a homosexual, was labelled a dangerous sexual offender and sentenced to life in prison, a sentence confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/4738/index.do?r=AAAAAQAFeW91dGgAAAAAAAAB|title=Klippert v. The Queen - SCC Cases (Lexum)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was released in 1971.

Sodomy was decriminalized after the ''[[Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968-69]]'' (Bill C-150) received royal assent on June 27, 1969. The offences of buggery and "gross indecency" were still in force, however the new act introduced exemptions for married couples, and any two consenting adults above the age of 21 regardless of gender or sexual orientation. The bill had been originally introduced in the House of Commons in 1967 by then Minister of Justice [[Pierre Trudeau]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Journals of the House of Commons |volume=CXV |year=1968–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; who famously stated that "there's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Pierre Trudeau |date=1967-12-21 |title=The CBC Digital Archives Website |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/rights_freedoms/clip/2671/|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revisions to the ''Criminal Code'' in 1987 repealed the offence of "gross indecency", changed "buggery" to "anal intercourse" and reduced the age exemption from 21 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Canada Evidence Act'', R.S.C. 1985 (3d Supp.), c. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 159 of the ''Criminal Code'' continues to criminalize anal sex, with exemptions for husbands and wives, and two consenting parties above the age of 18, provided no more than two people are present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-73.html#docCont|title=Criminal Code (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46)|publisher=Department of Justice Canada|date=23 April 2012|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent [[case law]] has held that section 159 is [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]], thus anal sex is ''de facto'' legal between any two or more [[Consent to sexual activity|consenting]] persons above the [[age of consent]] (16). In the 1995 [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] case ''R. v. M. (C.)'' the judges ruled that the law was unconstitutional on the basis that the specific exemptions based on marital status and age infringed on the [[social equality|equality rights]] guaranteed by [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 15]] of the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and constituted discrimination based on sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qrd.org/qrd/world/legal/youth.sodomy.law.ruling.txt |title=Ontario Youth Sodomy Law Ruling |date= |accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar decision was made by the [[Quebec Court of Appeal]] in the 1998 case ''R. v. Roy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/fr/qc/qcca/doc/1998/1998canlii12775/1998canlii12775.html|title=CanLII - 1998 CanLII 12775 (QC CA)|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2002 decision regarding a case in which three people were engaged in sexual intercourse.

=== Denmark ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Denmark}}
In 1933 Denmark became the third country in Europe to fully legalize homosexuality. The age of consent has been set at 15 since 1977.

=== France ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in France}}
Since the [[Penal Code of 1791]], France has not had laws punishing homosexual conduct ''per se'' between over-age consenting adults in private. However, other qualifications such as "offense to good mores" were occasionally retained in the 19th century ''(see [[Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès]])''.

In 1960, a [[:fr:Amendement Mirguet|parliamentary amendment]] by {{ill|Paul Mirguet|fr}} added homosexuality to a list of "social scourges", along with alcoholism and prostitution. This prompted the government to increase the penalties for public display of a sex act when the act was homosexual. [[transvestism|Transvestites]] or homosexuals caught [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] were also the target of police repression.

In 1981, the 1960 law making homosexuality an aggravating circumstance for public indecency was repealed.  Then in 1982, under president [[François Mitterrand]], the law from 1942 ([[Vichy France]]) making the age of consent for homosexual sex higher (18) than for heterosexual sex (15) was also repealed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&amp;dateJO=19820805&amp;numTexte=&amp;pageDebut=02502&amp;pageFin=|title=Fac-similé JO du 05/08/1982, page 02502 - Legifrance|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the vocal opposition of [[Jean Foyer]] in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.assemblee-nationale.fr/7/cri/1981-1982-ordinaire1/153.pdf Proceedings of the National assembly], 2nd sitting of 20 December 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Germany}}
[[Paragraph 175]], which punished "[[fornication]] between men", was eased to an [[age of consent]] of 21 in [[East Germany]] in 1957 and in West Germany in 1969.  This age was lowered to 18 in the East in 1968 and the West in 1973, and all legal distinctions between [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] acts were abolished in the East in 1988, with this change being extended to all of Germany in 1994 as part of the process of [[German Reunification]].

In modern [[German language|German]], the term ''Sodomie'' has a meaning different from the [[English language|English]] word "[[:wiktionary:sodomy|sodomy]]": it does not refer to anal sex, but acts of [[Zoophilia]]. The change occurred mostly in the middle of the 19th century, at least in the last decade of the century. Only the moral theology of the Roman Catholic church changed not until some time after World War II to the term ''homosexuality''.

"Homosexual Buggery". Before 2014, according to the [[Crimes Ordinance]] Section 118C,&lt;ref&gt;CRIMES ORDINANCE, Chapter 200, Section 118C, [http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s118c-19970630.html.html Homosexual buggery with or by man under 21], hklii.hk&lt;/ref&gt; both of the two men must be at least 16 to commit homosexual buggery legally or otherwise both of them can be liable to life imprisonment.  [http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s118f-19970630.html.html Sect 118F] states that committing homosexual buggery not privately is also illegal and can be liable to imprisonment for 5 years.

"Heterosexual Buggery". A man who commits buggery with a girl under 21 can also be liable for life imprisonment ([http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s118d.html Sect 118D]) while no similar laws concerning committing heterosexual buggery in private exist.

In 2005, Judge Hartmann found these 4 laws: Sect 118C, 118F, [http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s118h.html 118H], and [http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s118j.html 118J] were discriminatory towards gay males and unconstitutional under the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] and contrary to the Bill of Rights Ordinance in a judicial review filed by a Hong Kong resident.  It was believed that the age of consent had been reduced from 21 to 16 for any kind of homosexual sex acts. In 2014, the ordinance was amended according to the judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/egazettedownload?EGAZETTE_PDF_ID=11146 |title=Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance 2014 |publisher=Elegislation.gov.hk |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homosexuality has been legal in Iceland since 1940, but equal age of consent was not approved until 1992. [[Civil union]] was legalised by [[Alþingi]] in 1996 with 44 votes pro, 1 con, 1 neutral and 17 not present. Those laws were changed to allow adoption and [[artificial insemination]] for [[lesbians]] 27 June 2006 among other things. [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Same-sex marriage]] was legalised in 2010.

=== India ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in India}}
India inherited sodomy laws in its criminal code from the [[British Raj]], which were not present in its history of codified or customary legal system before. That section of Indian law, Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, called for a maximum punishment of life imprisonment for all ''carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal'' (primarily interpreted to be homosexuality, especially sodomy, including between consenting adults). This law had rarely been executed, if at all, in case of consenting adults, although sometimes was in the news when a homosexual rapist was apprehended. Police repression in alleged or real gay bars is common, and is often highlighted by the contemporary media.

On 2 July 2009, in the case of ''[[Naz Foundation v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi|Naz Foundation v National Capital Territory of Delhi]]'', the High Court of Delhi struck down much of S. 377 of the IPC as being unconstitutional. The Court held that to the extent S. 377 criminalised consensual non-vaginal sexual acts between adults, it violated an individual's fundamental rights to equality before the law, freedom from discrimination and to life and personal liberty under Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the [[Constitution of India]]. The High Court did not strike down S. 377 completely – it held the section was valid to the extent it related to non-consensual non-vaginal intercourse or to intercourse with minors – and it expressed the hope that Parliament would soon legislatively address the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jul/21/india-gay-rights-law|title=A New Law for India's Sexual Minorities|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=21 July 2009|author=Yuvraj Joshi|accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India does not recognize same-sex unions of any type. On December 11, 2013, the Supreme Court of India overturned the ruling in Naz Foundation v.

=== Iran ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Iran}}
Sodomy is illegal in Iran and is punishable by death.

=== Israel ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Israel}}
The State of Israel inherited its sodomy ("buggery") law from the legal code of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], but it was never enforced against homosexual acts that took place between consenting adults in private. In 1963, the Israeli Attorney-General declared that these laws would not be enforced. However, in certain criminal cases, defendants were convicted of "sodomy" (which includes [[oral sex]]), apparently by way of plea bargains; they had originally been indicted for more serious sexual offenses.

In the late 1960s, the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israeli Supreme Court]] ruled that these laws could not be enforced against consenting adults. Though unenforced, these laws remained in the penal code until 1988, when they were formally repealed by the [[Knesset]]. The [[age of consent]] for both heterosexuals and homosexuals is 16 years of age.

=== Italy ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Italy}}
In 1786 [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Pietro Leopoldo of Tuscany]], abolishing [[death penalty]] for all crimes, became not only the first Western ruler to do so, but also the first ruler to abolish death penalty for sodomy (though this was replaced with other sentences such as terms in prison or of hard labour).

The Code Napoléon made sodomy legal between consenting adults above the legal age of consent in all Italy except in the Kingdom of Sardinia, the Austria-ruled Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, and the Papal states.

In the newborn (1860) [[Kingdom of Italy]], Sardinia extended its legal code on the whole of Northern Italy, but not in the South, which made homosexual behaviour legal in the South and illegal in the North. However the first Italian penal code (Codice Zanardelli, 1889), decriminalised same-sex intercourse between consenting adults above the legal age of consent for all regions. A law that has not changed since it was enacted.

=== Japan ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Japan}}

In the [[Meiji Period]], sex between men was punishable under the sodomy laws announced in 1872 and revised in 1873. This was changed by laws announced in 1880 ([[:ja:同性愛#同性愛に関する法と政治|同性愛に関する法と政治]]). Since that time no further laws criminalizing homosexuality have been passed.

=== Macau ===

In [[Macau]], according to the [[Código Penal de Macau]] (''Penal Code of Macau'') [https://web.archive.org/web/20080502021527/http://www.imprensa.macau.gov.mo/bo/I/95/46/codpenpt/codpen0101.asp Article 166 &amp; 168], committing anal coitus with whomever under the age of 17 is a crime and shall be punished by imprisonment of up to 10 years (committing with whoever under 14) and 4 years (committing with whoever between 14 and 16) respectively.

=== Malaysia ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Malaysia}}
Sodomy is illegal in Malaysia, however still being practiced in private. The sodomy laws are sometimes enforced using Section 377 of the [[Penal Code (Malaysia)|Penal Code]] which prohibit [[carnal intercourse]] against the order of nature.

{{quote|Any person who has sexual connection with another person by the introduction of the penis into the anus or mouth of the other person is said to commit carnal intercourse against the order of nature.}}

The age of consent in Malaysia is 16. Punishment for voluntarily committing carnal intercourse against the order of nature shall be up to twenty years [[imprisonment]] and [[flagellation|whipping]] while committing the same offences but without consent, shall be punished by no less than five years imprisonment and whipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

There was the notable case involving [[Anwar Ibrahim]], former [[Leader of the Opposition (Malaysia)|Leader of the Opposition]] and [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]] who was convicted of sodomy crime under Section 377B of the Penal Code.

=== New Zealand ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in New Zealand}}

New Zealand inherited the United Kingdom's sodomy laws in 1854.
The Offences Against The Person Act of 1867 changed the penalty of buggery from execution to life imprisonment for "Buggery".  In 1961 in a revision of the Crimes Act, the penalty was reduced to a maximum of 7 years between consenting adult males.

Homosexual sex was legalised in New Zealand as a result of the passage of the [[Homosexual Law Reform Act|Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986]]. The age of consent was set at 16 years, the same as for heterosexual sex.

Since 4 September 2007 two out of the three territories of New Zealand ([[Niue]] and [[Tokelau]]) legalized homosexuality with an equal age of consent as well by the [http://www.austlii.edu.au/nz/legis/consol_act/naa2007146.pdf Niue Amendment Act 2007]. [[Cook Islands]] meanwhile still has a sodomy law on the books [http://www.paclii.org/ck/legis/num_act/ca196982/ Crimes Act (1969), s153 and a155].

Poland is one of the few countries where homosexuality has never been considered a crime. Forty years after Poland [[Partitions of Poland|lost its independence]], in 1795, the sodomy laws of [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] came into force in the occupied Polish lands. Poland retained these laws after independence in 1918, but they were never enforced, and were officially abandoned in 1932.

=== Russia ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Russia}}
In the past, in Russia sexual activity between males was criminalized by state law on March 4, 1934. Sexual activity between females was not mentioned in the law. On May 27, 1993, homosexual acts between consenting males were decriminalized.

=== Serbia ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Serbia}}
The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia later restricted the offense in 1959 to only apply to homosexual anal intercourse; but with the maximum sentence reduced from 2 to 1 year imprisonment. In 1994, male homosexual sexual intercourse was officially decriminalised in the [[Republic of Serbia (1992–2006)|Republic of Serbia]], a part of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. The [[age of consent]] was set at 18 years for anal intercourse between males and 14 for other sexual practices. An equal age of consent of 14 was later introduced on 1 January 2006, regardless of sexual orientation or gender.

The age of consent is 16, and [http://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawSingle.aspx?PCode=C0000001&amp;FLNO=227 Article 277] and the Child and Youth Sexual Transaction Prevention Act &lt;!-- Official name of this law could be found at http://english.www.gov.tw/Yearbook/index.jsp?categid=184&amp;recordid=52665--&gt;[http://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawSingle.aspx?PCode=D0050023&amp;FLNO=22 Article 22] make it a criminal offense to engage in sexual contact with minors. The law is written in gender neutral terms and does not discriminate against homosexual conduct.

[[Sodomy]] was historically known in England and Wales as '''[[buggery]]''', and is usually interpreted as referring to anal intercourse between two males or a male and a female. In England and Wales buggery was made a [[felony]] by the [[Buggery Act]] in 1533, during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. The punishment for those convicted was the death penalty until 1861 in England and Wales, and 1887 in Scotland. [[James Pratt and John Smith]] were the last two to be executed for sodomy in 1835. A lesser offence of "attempted buggery" was punished by 2 years of jail and some time on the [[pillory]]. In 1885, Parliament enacted the [[Labouchere Amendment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/englaw.html|title=The Law in England, 1290–1885|accessdate=2006-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibited ''gross indecency'' between males, a broad term that was understood to encompass most or all male homosexual acts. Following the [[Wolfenden report]], sexual acts between two adult males, with no other people present, were made legal in [[England and Wales]] in 1967, in Scotland in 1980, [[Northern Ireland]] in 1982, [[Crown Dependency|UK Crown Dependencies]] [[Guernsey]] in 1983, [[Jersey]] in 1990 and [[Isle of Man]] in 1992.

In the 1980s and 1990s,  [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|gay rights]] organizations made attempts to equalize the [[age of consent]] for heterosexuals and homosexuals, which had previously been 21 for homosexuals but only 16 for heterosexual acts. Efforts were also made to modify the "no other person present" clause so that it dealt only with minors. In 1994, Conservative MP [[Edwina Currie]] introduced an amendment to Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill which would have lowered the age of consent to 16. The amendment failed, but a compromise amendment which lowered the age of consent to 18 was accepted. The July 1, 1997 decision in the case ''[[Sutherland v. United Kingdom]]'' resulted in the [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]] which further reduced it to 16, and the "no other person present" clause was modified to "no minor persons present". Today, the universal age of consent is 16 in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2008/510/contents/made|title=Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 (Commencement) Order 2008|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom on 2 February 2009 (prior to that, the age of consent for both heterosexuals and homosexuals was 17). The three British [[Crown dependencies]] also have an equal age of consent at 16: since 2006, in the [[Isle of Man]]; since 2007, in [[Jersey]]; and since 2010 in [[Guernsey]].

{{See also|LGBT rights in the United States}}
[[Sodomy laws in the United States]] were largely a matter of [[U.S. state|state]] rather than federal jurisdiction, except for laws governing the [[US Military|U.S. Armed Forces]]. In the early 1960s, the penalties for sodomy in the various states varied from imprisonment for two to ten years and/or a fine of US$2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Don | last=Gilleland | title=50 years of change | url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20130103/COLUMNISTS0205/301030003/Guest-column-50-years-change| work= | newspaper=Florida Today | location=Melbourne, Florida | pages= 9A | date=January 3, 2013 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, the [[Model Penal Code]] recommended to the states repeal for consensual sodomy, and [[Illinois]] became the first American jurisdiction to do so.&lt;ref name=canaday&gt;{{cite web | last = Canaday | first = Margot | title = We Colonials: Sodomy Laws in America | publisher = [[The Nation]] | date = September 3, 2008 | url = http://www.thenation.com/article/we-colonials-sodomy-laws-america | accessdate = February 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2002, 36 states had repealed all sodomy laws or had them overturned by court rulings. The remaining sodomy laws were invalidated by the 2003 U.S. Supreme Court decision ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''.

As for the [[United States armed forces|U.S. Armed Forces]], because "the military is, by necessity, a specialized society separate from civilian society,"&lt;ref&gt;Boston College: [http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/comm/free_speech/parker.html ''Parker v.

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces|Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces]] has ruled that the ''Lawrence v. Texas'' decision applies to Article 125. In both ''United States v. Stirewalt'' and ''[[United States v. Marcum]]'', the court ruled that the "conduct falls within the liberty interest identified by the Supreme Court,"&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces: [http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/2004Term/03-0433.htm U.S. v.

=== Zimbabwe ===
{{See also|LGBT rights in Zimbabwe}}
Zimbabwe's President [[Robert Mugabe]] has waged a violent [[LGBT rights in Zimbabwe|campaign against homosexuals]], claiming that before colonization, Zimbabweans did not engage in homosexual acts.&lt;ref name="HOMO"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN030647770X&amp;id=ezBvVdRnWKsC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;ots=6IWk0seKwp&amp;dq=Mugabe+moral+campaign+homosexuality&amp;sig=tzSDUBuYv5c6Y8admBfF-Y-Azbo Page 213] ''Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender: Men and Women in the World's Cultures''&lt;/ref&gt; His first major public condemnation of homosexuality&lt;!-- Perhaps mention a couple of the subsequent ones to cite "the first"? --&gt; came during the [[Zimbabwe International Book Fair]] in August 1995.&lt;ref name="ZIB"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0773527516&amp;id=LvxMq2hNzm0C&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180&amp;ots=xI8D2NLVGn&amp;dq=Mugabe+moral+campaign+homosexuality&amp;sig=-81GDIVzFqwX10TbJjaRAXlT2TE#PPA180,M1 Page 180] ''Hungochani: The History of a Dissident Sexuality in Southern Africa''&lt;/ref&gt; He told the audience that homosexuality:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...Degrades human dignity. It's unnatural and there is no question ever of allowing these people to behave worse than dogs and pigs. If dogs and pigs do not do it, why must human beings? We have our own culture, and we must re-dedicate ourselves to our traditional values that make us human beings...

In September 1995, Zimbabwe's parliament introduced legislation banning homosexual acts.&lt;ref name="ZIB"/&gt; In 1997, a court found [[Canaan Banana]], Mugabe's predecessor and the first President of Zimbabwe, guilty of 11 counts of sodomy and indecent assault.&lt;ref name="BANANAtrial"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9042016264&amp;id=PFvYzAUheGkC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;ots=0hbU6n9tV1&amp;dq=Canaan+Banana+homosexual&amp;sig=2cfQK_-ufIaV-egJ-ob6Wfu2kkQ Page 93] ''Body, Sexuality, and Gender v. 1''&lt;/ref&gt; Banana's trial proved embarrassing for Mugabe, when Banana's accusers alleged that Mugabe knew about Banana's conduct and had done nothing to stop it.&lt;ref name="bananadeath"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/zimbabwe/article/0,2763,1082496,00.html Canaan Banana, president jailed in sex scandal, dies] ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, Banana fled Zimbabwe only to return in 1999 and served one year in prison for his homosexual acts. Banana was also stripped of his priesthood.

The '''Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute''' or SWF Institute, or SWFI, is a global corporation analyzing public asset owners such as [[sovereign wealth fund]]s and other long-term governmental investors.  Initially, the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute focused solely on sovereign wealth funds.  It has branched out to cover all types of public institutional investors.  The institute is a [[financial data vendor]] but provides information to the media as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Susanna|title=Why Norwegians Are Millionaires and Americans Are Paupers |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/norwegians-millionaires-norways-sovereign-wealth-fund/story?id=21488085|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blas|first=Javier|title=Protecting Nigeria oil SWF is no easy task |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/69325c28-2440-11e3-a8f7-00144feab7de.html#axzz2qJ6YUFpy|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abedine|first=Saad|title=Body of Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund chief found |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/03/30/uae.body/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by [[Michael Maduell]] and Carl Linaburg in late 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Brad|title=Is there an SWF in your future? |url=http://www.irmagazine.com/articles/shareholder-targeting-id/20204/there-swf-your-future/|publisher=IR Magazine|date=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SWFI sells data subscriptions to asset managers, banks, researchers, universities, governments, institutional investors, asset owners, corporations, law firms and other entities.

==Transparency Ratings==
The SWFI came out with the Linaburg-Maduell Transparency Index in 2008.  It is a 10-point scale based on ten principles of transparency, each adding one point to the index rating. The index is used by sovereign wealth funds in their annual reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan ranks among the highest in Transparency Index |url=http://www.oilfund.az/en_US/news/558/100/The-State-Oil-Fund-of-the-Republic-of-Azerbaijan-ranks-among-the-highest-in-Transparency-Index.asp|publisher=SOFAZ|accessdate=11 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NSIA Rated Transparent by Sovereign Wealth Institute |url=http://nsia.com.ng/nsia-rated-transparent-sovereign-wealth-institute/|publisher=Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data==
The SWFI tracks direct deals in sovereign wealth funds.  The value of global direct deals by sovereign-wealth funds hit $50.02 billion in the first half of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunkley|first=Dan |title=Sovereign-Wealth Funds Pump Near Record Amount of Cash in Deals |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/08/07/sovereign-wealth-funds-pump-near-record-amount-of-cash-in-deals/|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SWFI tracks the assets of sovereign wealth funds, pensions, endowments and other asset owners.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31985">The '''storage effect''' is a coexistence mechanism proposed in the [[ecological theory]] of [[species]] coexistence, which tries to explain how such a wide variety of similar species are able to coexist within the same [[ecological community]] or [[Guild (ecology)|guild]].

The storage effect can be caused by both temporal and spatial variation.  The temporal storage effect (often referred to as simply "the storage effect") occurs when species benefit from changes in year-to-year environmental patterns,&lt;ref name="Chesson &amp; Warner 1981"/&gt; while the spatial storage effect occurs when species benefit from variation in microhabitats across a landscape.&lt;ref name='Chesson 2000space'&gt;{{Cite journal|title=General theory of competitive coexistence in spatially varying environments|journal=Theoretical population biology|year=2000|first=Peter|last= Chesson|volume=58|issue=3|pmid=11120650|pages=211–237|id= |url=|format= |accessdate=|doi=10.1006/tpbi.2000.1486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The concept==

For the storage effect to operate, it requires variation (i.e. fluctuations) in the environment&lt;ref name="Chesson &amp; Warner 1981"/&gt; and thus can be termed a "fluctuation-dependent mechanism".  This variation can come from a large degree of factors, including resource availability, temperature, and predation levels.  However, for the storage effect to function, this variation must change the birth, survival, or [[recruitment (biology)|recruitment]] rate of species from year to year (or patch to patch).&lt;ref name="Chesson &amp; Warner 1981"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chesson 2000space"/&gt;

For competing species within the same community to coexist, they have to meet one fundamental requirement: the impact of competition from a species on itself must exceed its competitive impact on other species. In other words, [[intraspecific competition]] must exceed [[interspecific competition]].&lt;ref name='Chesson 2000review'&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Mechanisms of maintenance of species diversity|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|year=2000|first=Peter|last= Chesson|volume=31|issue=|pages=343–366|id= |url=|format= |accessdate=|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.31.1.343}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, jackrabbits living in the same area compete for food and nesting grounds. Such competition within the same species is called [[intraspecific competition]], which limits the growth of the species itself. Members from different species can also compete. For instance, jackrabbits and cottontail rabbits also compete for food and nesting grounds. Competition between different species is called [[interspecific competition]], which limits the growth of other species. Stable coexistence occurs when any one species in the community limits its own growth more strongly than the growth of others.

The storage effect mixes three essential ingredients to assemble a community of competing species that fulfill the requirement. They are 1) correlation between the quality of an environment and the amount of competition experienced by a population in that environment (i.e. [[covariance]] between environment and competition), 2) differences in species response to the same environment (i.e. species-specific environmental responses), and 3) the ability of a population to diminish the impact of competition under worsening environment (i.e. buffered population growth).&lt;ref name="Chesson 1994"/&gt;  Each ingredient is described in detail below with an explanation why the combination of the three leads to species coexistence.

===Covariance between environment and competition===

The growth of a population can be strongly influenced by the environment it experiences. An environment consists of not only physical elements such as resource abundance, temperature, and level of physical disturbance, but also biological elements such as the abundance of [[predation|natural enemies]] and [[mutualists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Herbert George|last=Andrewartha|author2=Birch, Charles |title=The distribution and abundance of animals|year=1954|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-02026-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually organisms reproduce more in a favorable environment (i.e. either during a good year, or within a good patch), build up their population densities, and lead themselves to a high level of [[competition (biology)|competition]] due to this increasing crowding.&lt;ref name="Chesson 1994"/&gt; Such a trend means that higher quality environments usually correlate with a higher strength of competition experienced by the organisms in those environments. In short, a better environment results in stronger competition.&lt;ref name="Chesson 1994"/&gt; In statistics, such [[correlation]] means that there will be a non-zero [[covariance]] between the change of population density in response to the environment and that to the competition. That is why the first ingredient is called "[[covariance]] between environment and competition".

===Species-specific environmental responses===

Covariance between environment and competition suggests that organisms experience the strongest [[competition (biology)|competition]] under their optimal environmental conditions because their populations grow most rapidly in those conditions. In nature, we often find that different species from the same community respond to the same conditions in distinctive manners.  For example, plant species have different preferred levels of light and water availability, which affect their germination and physical growth rates.&lt;ref name="Pake &amp; Venable 1995"/&gt;  Such differences in their response to the environment, which is called "species-specific environmental response," means no two species from a community will have the same best environment in a given year or a given patch. As a result, when a species is under its optimal environmental conditions and thus experiencing the strongest [[intraspecific competition]], other species from the same community only experience the strongest [[interspecific competition]] coming from that species, but not the strongest [[intraspecific competition]] coming from themselves.

===Buffered population growth===

A population can decline when environmental conditions worsen and when competition intensifies. If a species cannot limit the impact of competition in a hostile environment, its population will crash, and it will become locally extinct.&lt;ref name="Chesson &amp; Warner 1981"/&gt; Marvelously, in nature organisms are often able to slow down the rate of population decline in a hostile environment by alleviating the impact of competition. In so doing, they are able to set up a lower limit on the rate of their population decline.&lt;ref name="Chesson &amp; Warner 1981"/&gt; This phenomenon is called "buffered population growth", which occurs under a variety of situations. Under the temporal storage effect, it can be accomplished by the adults of a species having long life spans, which are relatively unaffected by environmental stressors. For example, an adult tree is unlikely to be killed by a few weeks of drought or a single night of freezing temperatures, whereas a seedling may not survive these conditions.&lt;ref name="Kelly &amp; Bowler 2002"/&gt; Even if all seedlings are killed by bad environmental conditions, the long-lived adults are able to keep the overall population from crashing.&lt;ref name="Chesson &amp; Warner 1981"/&gt; Moreover, the adults usually adopt strategies such as dormancy or hibernation under a hostile environment, which make them less sensitive to competition, and allows them to buffer against the double blades of the hostile environment and competition from their rivals. For a different example, buffered population growth is attained by annual plants with a persistent seed bank.&lt;ref name="Pake &amp; Venable 1995"/&gt; Thanks to these long-lived seeds, the entire population cannot be destroyed by a single bad year. Moreover, the seeds stay dormant under unfavorable environmental conditions, avoiding direct competition with rivals who are favored by the same environment, and thus diminish the impact of competition in bad years.&lt;ref name="Pake &amp; Venable 1995"/&gt; There are some temporal situations in which buffered population growth is not expected to occur.  Namely, when multiple generations do not overlap (such as [[Furcifer labordi|Labord’s chameleon]]) or when adults have a high mortality rate (such as many aquatic insects, or some populations of the [[Eastern Fence Lizard]] &lt;ref name='Tinkle &amp; Ballinger 1972'&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Sceloporus undulatus: a study of intraspecific comparative demography of a lizard|journal=Ecology|year=1972|first=Donald|last=Tinkle|author2=Ballinger, Royce |volume=53|issue=4|pages=570–584|id= |format= |doi=10.2307/1934772|jstor=1934772}}&lt;/ref&gt;), buffered growth does not occur. Under the spatial storage effect, buffered population growth is generally automatic, because the effects of a detrimental [[microhabitat]] will only be experienced by individuals in that area, rather than the population as a whole.&lt;ref name="Chesson 2000space"/&gt;

===Outcome===

The combined effect of (1) [[covariance]] between environment and competition, and (2) species-specific response to the environment decouple the strongest intraspecific and interspecific competition experienced by a species.&lt;ref name="Chesson 1994"/&gt; [[Intraspecific competition]] is strongest when a species is favored by the environment, whereas [[interspecific competition]] is strongest when its rivals are favored. After this decoupling, buffered population growth limits the impact of [[interspecific competition]] when a species is not favored by the environment. As a consequence, the impact of [[intraspecific competition]] on the species favored by a particular environment exceeds that of the [[interspecific competition]] on species less favored by that environment. We see that the fundamental requirement for species coexistence is fulfilled and thus storage effect is able to maintain stable coexistence in a community of competing species.&lt;ref name="Chesson 1994"/&gt;

For species to coexist in a community, all species must be able to recover from low density.&lt;ref name="Chesson 2000review"/&gt; Not surprisingly, being a coexistence mechanism, the storage effect helps species when they become rare. It does so by making the abundant species’ effect on itself greater than its effect on the rare species.&lt;ref name="Chesson 1994"/&gt; The difference between species’ response to environmental conditions means that a rare species’ optimal environment is not the same as its competitors. Under these conditions, the rare species will experience low levels of [[interspecific competition]].  Because the rare species itself is rare, it will experience little impact from [[intraspecific competition]] as well, even at its highest possible levels of intraspecific competition. Free from the impact of competition, the rare species is able to make gains in these good years or patches.&lt;ref name="Chesson &amp; Warner 1981"/&gt;  Moreover, thanks to the buffered population growth, the rare species is able to survive the bad years or patches by "storing" the gains from the good years/patches. As a result, the population of any rare species is able to grow due to the storage effect.

One natural outcome from the [[covariance]] between environment and competition is that the species with very low densities will have more fluctuation in its [[recruitment (biology)|recruitment]] rates than species with normal densities.&lt;ref name='Sears &amp; Chesson 2007'&gt;{{Cite journal|title=New methods for quantifying the spatial storage effect: an illustration with desert annuals|journal=Ecology|year=2007|first=Anna|last=Sears|author2=Chesson, Peter |volume=88|issue=9|pmid=17918402|pages=2240–2247|id= |url=|format= |accessdate=|doi=10.1890/06-0645.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;    This occurs because in good environments, species with high densities will often experience large amount of crowding by members of the same species, thus limiting the benefits of good years/patches, and making good years/patches more similar to bad years/patches.  Low-density species are rarely able to cause crowding, thus allowing significantly increased fitness in good years/patches.&lt;ref name="Chesson &amp; Warner 1981"/&gt;   Since the fluctuation in [[recruitment (biology)|recruitment]] rate is an indicator of covariance between environment and competition, and since species-specific environmental response and buffered population growth can normally be assumed in nature, finding much stronger fluctuation in [[recruitment (biology)|recruitment]] rates in rare and low-density species provides a strong indication that the storage effect is operating within a community.&lt;ref name="Kelly &amp; Bowler 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sears &amp; Chesson 2007"/&gt;

==Mathematical formulation==

It is important to note that the storage effect is not a model for population growth (such as the [[Lotka&amp;ndash;Volterra equation]]) itself, but is an effect that appears in non-additive models of population growth.&lt;ref name="Chesson 1994"/&gt;  Thus, the equations shown below will work for any arbitrary model of population growth, but will only be as accurate as the original model.  The derivation below is taken from Chesson 1994.&lt;ref name="Chesson 1994"/&gt;  It is a derivation of the temporal storage effect, but is very similar to the spatial storage effect.

The [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of an individual, as well as expected [[population growth|growth rate]], can be measured in terms of the average number of offspring it will leave during its lifetime.  This parameter, ''r''(''t''), is a function of both environmental factors, ''e''(''t''), and how much the organism must [[competition (biology)|compete]] with other individuals (both of its own species, and different species), ''c''(''t'').  Thus,

: &lt;math&gt;r(t) = g(e(t), c(t)) \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''g'' is an arbitrary function for growth rate.  Throughout the article, subscripts are occasionally used to represent functions of a particular species (e.g. ''r''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') is the fitness of species ''j'').  It is assumed that there must be some values ''e*'' and ''c*'', such that ''g''(''e''*,&amp;nbsp;''c''*)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, representing a zero-population growth equilibrium.  These values need not be unique, but for every ''e*'', there is a unique ''c*''.  For ease of calculation, standard parameters ''E''(''t'') and ''C''(''t'') are defined, such that

: &lt;math&gt;E(t) = g(e(t), c^*) \, &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;C(t) = -g(e^*, c(t)) \, &lt;/math&gt;

Both ''E'' and ''C'' represent the effect of deviations in environmental response from equilibrium.  ''E'' represents the effect that varying environmental conditions (e.g. rainfall patterns, temperature, food availability, etc.) have on fitness, in the absence of abnormal competitive effects.  For the storage effect to occur, the environmental response for each species must be unique (i.e. ''E''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''E''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') when ''j''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''i'').  ''C''(''t'') represents how much average fitness is lowered as a result of [[competition (biology)|competition]].  For example, if there is more rain during a given year, ''E''(''t'') will likely increase.  If more plants begin to bloom, and thus compete for that rain, then ''C''(''t'') will increase as well.  Because ''e*'' and ''c*'' are not unique, ''E''(''t'') and ''C''(''t'') are not unique, and thus one should choose them as conveniently as possible.  Under most conditions (see Chesson 1994&lt;ref name="Chesson 1994"/&gt;), ''r''(''t'') can be approximated as

: &lt;math&gt;r(t) = E(t) - C(t) + \gamma E(t)C(t) \, &lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{\partial^2r}{\partial E \, \partial C}&lt;/math&gt;

''γ'' represents the nonadditivity of growth rates.  If ''γ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 (known as [[additive map|additivity]]) it means that the impact of competition on fitness does not change with the environment.  If ''γ''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 ([[superadditivity]]), it means that the adverse effects of competition during a bad year are relatively worse than during a good year.  In other words, a population suffers more from competition in bad years than in good years.  If ''γ''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0 ([[subadditivity]], or buffered population growth), it means that the harm done by competition during a bad year is relatively minor when compared to a good year.  In other words, the population is able to diminish the impact of competition as the environment worsens.  As stated above, for the storage effect to contribute to species coexistence, we must have buffered population growth (i.e. it must be the case that ''γ''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0).

The long-term average of the above equation is

: &lt;math&gt;\bar{r} = \bar{E} - \bar{C} + \gamma (\bar{E}\bar{C} + \text{Cov}(E(t),C(t))) \, &lt;/math&gt;

which, under environments with sufficient variation relative to mean effects, can be approximated as

: &lt;math&gt;\bar{r} \approx \bar{E} - \bar{C} + \gamma \text{Cov}(E(t),C(t))&lt;/math&gt;

For any effect to act as a coexistence mechanism, it must boost the average fitness of an individual when they are at below-normal population density.  Otherwise, a species at low density (known as an `invader') will continue to dwindle, and this negative feedback will cause its extinction.  When a species is at equilibrium (known as a `resident'), its average long-term fitness must be 0.  For a species to recover from low density, its average fitness must be greater than 0.  For the remainder of the text, we refer to functions of the invader with the subscript ''i'', and to the resident with the subscript ''r''.

A long-term average growth rate of an invader is often written as

: &lt;math&gt;\bar{r_i} = \Delta E - \Delta C + \Delta I \,&lt;/math&gt;

where,

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta E = \bar{E_i} - \sum_{i\neq r} q_{ir}\bar{E_r} \, &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta C = \bar{C_i} - \sum_{i\neq r} q_{ir}\bar{C_r} \, &lt;/math&gt;

and, ΔI, the storage effect,

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta I = \gamma_i \text{Cov}(E_i,C_i) - \sum_{i\neq r} q_{ir}\gamma_r \text{Cov}(E_r, C_r) \, &lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;q_{ir} = \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial C_r}&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''ir''&lt;/sub&gt; tells us how much the competition experienced by ''r'' affects the competition experienced by&amp;nbsp;''i''.

The biological meaning of the storage effect is expressed in the mathematical form of ΔI.  The first term of the expression is [[covariance]] between environment and competition (Cov(''E''&amp;nbsp;''C'')), scaled by a factor representing buffered population growth (''γ'').  The difference between the first term and the second term represents the difference in species responses to the environment between the invader and the sum of the residents, scaled by the effect each resident has on the invader&amp;nbsp;(''q''&lt;sub&gt;''ir''&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Chesson 1994"/&gt;

==Predation==

Recent work has extended what is known about the storage effect to include [[apparent competition]] (i.e., competition mediated through a shared predator).

These models showed that generalist predators can undermine the benefits of the storage effect that from competition.&lt;ref name="Kuang &amp; Chesson 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuang|first1=Jessica|last2=Chesson|first2=Peter|title=Coexistence of annual plants: Generalist seed predation weakens the storage effect|date=2009|journal=Ecology|volume=90|pages=170–182|url=http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/08-0207.1|doi=10.1890/08-0207.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs because generalist predators depress population levels by eating individuals. When this happens, there are fewer individuals competing for resources. As a result, relatively abundant species are less constrained by competition for resource in favorable years (i.e., the covariance between environment and competition is weakened), and therefore the storage effect from competition is weakened. This conclusion follows the general trend that the introduction of a generalist predator will often weaken other competition-based coexistence mechanisms, and which result in [[competitive exclusion]].&lt;ref name="Chesson &amp; Kuang 2008_nature"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesson|first1=Peter|last2=Kuang|first2=Jessica|title=The interaction between predation and competition|date=2008|journal=Nature|volume=456|issue=7219|pages=235–238|pmid=19005554|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v456/n7219/full/nature07248.html|doi=10.1038/nature07248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holt 1977"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holt|first1=Robert|title=Predation, apparent competition, and structure of prey communities|date=1977|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|volume=12|issue=2|pages=197–229|doi=10.1016/0040-5809(77)90042-9|pmid=929457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, certain types of predators can produce a storage effect from predation.  This effect has been shown for [[prey switching|frequency-dependent predators]], who are more likely to attack prey that are abundant,&lt;ref name="Chesson &amp; Kuang 2010_multi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesson|first1=Peter|last2=Kuang|first2=Jessica|title=The storage effect due to frequency-dependent predation in multispecies plant communities|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=2010|volume=78|issue=2|pages=148–164|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2010.06.003|pmid=20600208}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for generalist pathogens, who cause outbreaks when prey are abundant.&lt;ref name="Mordecai 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mordecai|first1=Erin|title=Pathogen impacts on plant communities: Unifying theory, concepts, and empirical work|journal=Ecological Monographs|date=2011|volume=81|issue=3|pages=429–441|doi=10.1890/10-2241.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When prey species are especially numerous and active, frequency-dependent predators become more active, and pathogens outbreaks become more severe (i.e., there was a positive covariance between the environment and predation, analogous to the covariance between the environment and competition).  As a result, abundant species are limited during their best years by high predation – an effect that is analogous to the storage effect from competition.

==Empirical studies==

The first empirical study that tested the requirements of the storage effect was done by Pake and Venable,&lt;ref name="Pake &amp; Venable 1995"/&gt; who looked at three desert [[annual plant]]s.  They experimentally manipulated density and water availability over a two-year period, and found that [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] and [[germination]] rates varied greatly from year to year, and over different environmental conditions.  This shows that each species has a unique environmental response, and implied that likely there is a [[covariance]] between environment and competition.  This, combined with the buffered population growth that is a product of a long-lived [[soil seed bank|seed bank]], showed that a temporal storage effect was probably an important factor in mediating coexistence.  This study was also important, because it showed that variation in [[germination]] conditions could be a major factor promoting species coexitstence.&lt;ref name="Pake &amp; Venable 1995"/&gt;

The first attempt made at quantifying the temporal storage effect was by Cáceres in 1997.&lt;ref name="Caceres 1997"/&gt;  Using 30 years of water-column data from [[Oneida Lake]], New York, she studied the effect the storage effect had on two species of [[Daphnia|plankton]] ([[Daphnia galeata mendotae]] and ''D. pulicaria'').  These species of plankton lay [[diapause|diapausing]] eggs which, much like the seeds of annual plants, lay dormant in the sediment for many years before hatching.  Cáceres found that the size of reproductive bouts were fairly uncorrelated between the two species.  She also found, in the absence of the storage effect, D. galeata mendotae would have gone extinct.  She was unable to measure certain important parameters (such as the rate of egg predation), but found that her results were robust to a wide range of estimates.&lt;ref name="Caceres 1997"/&gt;

The first test of the spatial storage effect was done by Sears and Chesson &lt;ref name="Sears &amp; Chesson 2007"/&gt; in the desert area east of Portal, Arizona.  Using a common neighbor-removal experiment, they examined whether coexistence between two annual plants, [[Erodium cicutarium]] and Phacelia popeii, was due to the spatial storage effect or resource partitioning.  The storage effect was quantified in terms of number of inflorescences (a proxy for fitness) instead of actual population growth rate.  They found that E. cicutarium was able to outcompete P. popeii in many situations, and in the absence of the storage effect, would likely competitively exclude P. popeii.  However, they found a very strong difference in the [[covariance]] between environment and competition, which showed that some of the most favorable areas for P. popeii (the rare species), were unfavorable to E. cicutarium (the common species).  This suggests that P. popeii is able to avoid strong [[interspecific competition]] in some good patches, and that this may be enough to compensate for losses in areas favorable to E. cicutarium.&lt;ref name="Sears &amp; Chesson 2007"/&gt;

Colleen Kelly and colleagues have used congeneric species pairs to examine storage dynamics where species similarity is a natural outcome of relatedness and not dependent on researcher-based estimates.  Initial studies were of 12 species of trees coexisting in a tropical deciduous forest at the Chamela Biological Station in [[Jalisco]], Mexico.&lt;ref name="Kelly &amp; Bowler 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Coexistence and relative abundance in forest tree species|journal=Nature|year=2002|first=Colleen|last=Kelly|author2=Bowler, Michael |volume=417|issue=6887|pages=437–440|id= |url=|format= |accessdate=|doi=10.1038/417437a|pmid=12024212}}&lt;/ref&gt; For each of the 12 species they examined age structure (calculated from size and species-specific growth rate), and found that [[recruitment (biology)|recruitment]] of young trees varies from year to year.  Grouping the species into 6 congeneric pairs, the locally rarer species of each pair unanimously had a more irregular [[age distribution]]s than the more common species. This finding strongly suggests that between closely competing tree species, the rarer species experiences stronger [[recruitment (biology)|recruitment]] fluctuation than the commoner species. Such difference in [[recruitment (biology)|recruitment]] fluctuation, combined with evidence of greater competitive ability in the rarer species of each pair, indicates a difference in [[covariance]] between the environment and competition between rare and common species. Since species-specific environmental response and buffered population growth can be naturally assumed, their finding strongly suggests that the storage effect operates in this tropical deciduous forest so as to maintain the coexistence between different tree species.  Further work with these species has shown that the storage dynamic is a pairwise, competitive relationship, between congeneric species pairs, and possibly extending as successively nested pairs within a genus.&lt;ref name="Kelly &amp; Bowler 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A new application of storage dynamics: differential sensitivity, diffuse competition and temporal niches|journal=Ecology|year=2005|first=Colleen|last=Kelly|author2=Bowler, Michael |volume=86|issue=4|pages=1012–1022|id= |url=|format= |accessdate=|doi=10.1890/04-0091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angert and colleagues demonstrated the temporal storage effect occurring in the desert annual plant community on [[Tumamoc Hill]], Arizona.&lt;ref name='Angert etal 2009'&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Functional tradeoffs determine species coexistence via the storage effect|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2009|first=Amy|last=Angert |author2=Huxman, Travis |author3=Chesson, Peter |author4=Venable, D.

As a result, some plants grew better during wet years, while others grew better during dry years.  This, combined with variation in [[germination]] rates, produced an overall community average storage effect of 0.103.  In other words, the storage effect is expected to help the population of any species at low density to increase, on average, by 10.3% each generation, until it recovers from low density.&lt;ref name="Angert etal 2009"/&gt;

'''Stream restoration''' or '''river restoration,''' sometimes called '''river reclamation''' in the UK, describes a set of activities that help improve the environmental health of a [[river]] or [[stream]]. These activities aim to restore the natural state and functioning of the river system in support of biodiversity, recreation, flood management and landscape development.&lt;ref&gt;

Improved health may be indicated by expanded [[habitat]] for diverse species (e.g. fish, aquatic insects, other wildlife) and reduced stream bank [[Erosion#Water|erosion]].&lt;ref name=montgomery&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/water/restoration/streams.html |title=Stream Restoration |publisher=Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection (MCDEP) |location=Rockville, MD |accessdate=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enhancements may also include improved [[water quality]] (i.e. reduction of [[water pollution|pollutant]] levels and increase of [[dissolved oxygen]] levels) and achieving a self-sustaining, functional [[Environmental flow|flow regime]] in the stream system that does not require periodic human intervention, such as [[dredging]] or construction of [[flood]] control structures.&lt;ref name="Gilman &amp; Karl"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gilman |first1=Joshua B. |last2=Karl |first2=Jarrod |date=May 2009 |title=Challenges of Stream Restoration as a Stormwater Management Tool; Part 1: A designer's perspective |journal=Stormwater |volume=10 |issue=3 |url=http://www.stormh2o.com/SW/Articles/6082.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207093803/http://www.stormh2o.com/SW/Articles/6082.aspx |archive-date=2015-02-07 |doi= |issn=1531-0574}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean"&gt;{{cite news |title=Follow the Silt |first=Cornelia |last=Dean |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/science/24stream.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stream restoration projects can also yield increased property values in adjacent areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Bailey |first1=Pam |last2=Fischenich |first2=J.

Stream restoration differs from:
*[[river engineering]], a term which typically refers to alteration of a water body for a non-environmental benefit such as navigation, flood control or water supply diversion;
*[[waterway restoration]], a term used in the [[United Kingdom]] describing alterations to a canal or river to improve navigability and related recreational amenities.

==Restoration techniques==
[[File:Robinson Creek after.jpg|thumb|right|Robinson Creek restoration project (2005) included re-shaping of stream bank slopes, addition of live willow and large rock baffles, removal of [[invasive species]] and revegetation with indigenous species.&lt;ref&gt;Mendocino County Resource Conservation District, Ukiah, CA (2008). [https://archive.is/20120805083246/http://www.ice.ucdavis.edu/nrpi/project.asp?ProjectPK=09744 "Robinson Creek Restoration Project."] Project No. DWR P13-045.&lt;/ref&gt;]] Restoration activities may range from a simple removal of a disturbance which inhibits natural stream function (e.g. repairing or replacing a [[culvert]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lawrence, J.E. M.R. Cover, C.L. May, and V.H. Resh. |title=Replacement of Culvert Styles has Minimal Impact on Benthic Macroinvertebrates in Forested, Mountainous Streams of Northern California |journal=Limnologica |year=2014 |volume=47 | doi=10.1016/j.limno.2014.02.002 |pages=7–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or removing barriers to fish such as weirs), to stabilization of [[stream bank]]s, to more active intervention such as installation of [[stormwater]] management facilities, such as  [[riparian zone restoration]] and [[constructed wetland]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cronin |first1=Amanda |date=March–April 2003 |title=Restoring Paradise in Moscow, Idaho |journal=Land and Water |volume=47 |issue=2 |page=18 |url=http://www.landandwater.com/features/vol47no2/vol47no2_1.html |doi= |issn=0192-9453 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[recycled water]] to augment streamflows that have been depleted as a result of human activities can also be considered a form of stream restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bischel |first=H.N. |author2=J.E.

Recent studies suggest that [[Lock (water navigation)|navigation locks]] have a potential to be operated as vertical slot [[fishway]]s to provide increased access for a range of biota, including poor swimmers.&lt;ref&gt;Silva, S., Lowry, M., Macaya-Solis, C., Byatt, B., &amp; Lucas, M. C. (2017). Can navigation locks be used to help migratory fishes with poor swimming performance pass tidal barrages? A test with lampreys. Ecological engineering, 102, 291-302&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful restoration projects begin with careful study of the stream system, including the historical weather patterns, stream [[Hydraulic engineering|hydraulics]], [[sediment transport]] patterns and related conditions. Researchers evaluating restoration projects have found that many of these projects subsequently fail (e.g., with flooding or excessive erosion) because the projects were not designed with a sufficient scientific basis; restoration techniques may have been selected for aesthetic reasons.&lt;ref name="Gilman &amp; Karl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean" /&gt;

===In-stream techniques===

====Channel modification====
Modifications to a [[stream channel]] may be appropriate to address degradation. Channel modifications may yield improved habitat for wildlife and plants in a stream corridor, but can result in flooding, excessive erosion or other damage if not carefully planned. Design of modifications involves a careful analysis of a complex [[fluvial]] processes.&lt;ref name="Washington-SHRG"&gt;{{Cite report |chapter=Fluvial Geomorphology (Appendix) |title=Stream Habitat Restoration Guidelines |url=http://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/00043/wdfw00043.pdf |author1=Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) |author2=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |author3=Washington Department of Ecology |year=2004 |accessdate=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alterations may include channel shape (in terms of [[sinuosity]] and [[meander]] characteristics), cross-section and channel profile (slope along the channel bed). Alterations affect the [[dissipation]] of energy through the channel, which affects stream velocity and [[turbulence]], [[sediment transport|sediment]] volume and size distribution, scour, and water surface elevations, among other characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |chapter=Channel Modification |title=Stream Habitat Restoration Guidelines |url=http://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/00043/wdfw00043.pdf |author1=WDFW |year=2004 |accessdate=2016-03-22|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Double Cross-Vane Structure (8079839399).jpg|thumb|Cross-vanes]]
====Cross-vanes and related structures====
A cross-vane is a "U"-shaped structure of [[boulder]]s or logs, built across the channel to reduce velocity and energy near the stream banks. It reduces bank erosion, maintains channel capacity and provides other benefits such as improved habitat for aquatic species. Similar structures used to dissipate stream energy include the W-Weir and J-Hook Vane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Rosgen |first1=Dave |date=August 2007 |title=Stream Restoration Design |section=654.1102. Restoration phases |url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/water/manage/restoration/?cid=stelprdb1044707 |chapter-url=http://directives.sc.egov.usda.gov/17771.wba |publisher=Natural Resources Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture |location=Washington, D.C.|page=11-58 |id=National Engineering Handbook 654. 210–VI–NEH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Imbricated rip rap====
Stones are placed along the stream bank in an overlapping pattern, to protect the bank from erosion or washout. This technique may be employed where the stream segment is highly confined, or where [[infrastructure]] is threatened.&lt;ref name=montgomery/&gt;
[[File:Rock Creek - step pool 2013a.jpg|thumb|Boulder step pools installed in [[Rock Creek (Potomac River)|Rock Creek]], Washington, D.C. The pools raise the water level and allow fish to swim over a partially-submerged sewer pipe which crosses the creek.]]
====Step pools====
In downstream areas, rocks are used to build a series of pools that gradually lower the elevation of the stream and reduce stream flow.&lt;ref name=montgomery/&gt;

====Brush layering====
Live branch cuttings are placed along the stream bank. As new plants sprout from the live branches, the roots anchor the soil and prevent erosion.&lt;ref name=montgomery/&gt;

====Engineered log jams====
An emerging stream restoration technique is the installation of ''engineered [[log jam]]s.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |chapter=Large Wood and Log Jams |title=Stream Habitat Restoration Guidelines |url=http://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/00043/wdfw00043.pdf |author1=WDFW |year=2004 |accessdate=2016-03-22|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reintroduction of [[large woody debris]] into a stream is a fairly recent method that is being experimented with in streams such as [[Lagunitas Creek]] in Marin County, California &lt;ref name="large-wood"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lawrence |first1=J.E. |last2=Resh |first2=V.H. |last3=Cover |first3=M.R. |title=Large-wood Loading from Natural and Engineered Processes at the Watershed Scale |journal=River Research and Applications |year=2014 |volume=29 |doi=10.1002/rra.2589 |pages=1030–1041}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thornton Creek]], in Seattle, Washington. Because of [[River engineering#Channelization|channelization]] and removal of woody debris, many streams now lack the hydraulic complexity that is necessary to maintain bank stabilization and a healthy plant/animal habitat. Engineered log jams are individually designed to meet the needs of specific restoration projects, but there are overarching design elements. One element is to anchor logs along the stream bank in order to create a physical blockade against [[erosion]]. Large wood pieces, both living &lt;ref name="large-wood"/&gt; and dead,&lt;ref name="Dixon, S.J., and Sear, D.A. 2014 9194–9210"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dixon |first1=S.J. |last2=Sear |first2=D.A. |title=The influence of geomorphology on large wood dynamics in a low gradient headwater stream |journal=Water Resources Research |year=2014 |volume=50 |issue=12 |doi=10.1002/2014WR015947 |pages=9194–9210}}&lt;/ref&gt; play an important role in the long-term stability of engineered log jams.  A second element of engineered [[log jam]]s is to improve fish habitat. Log jams add diversity to the water flow by creating riffles, pools, and temperature variations. This is vital to fish because it provides the right circumstances to spawn, rest, feed, hunt, and hide.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

There are inherent dangers to engineered log dams. If not properly implemented, they cause erosion and sediment in unwanted areas leading to more damage than repair.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Furthermore, the individual pieces of wood in logjams are rarely stable over long time periods and are naturally transported downstream where they are trapped by further logjams,&lt;ref name="Dixon, S.J., and Sear, D.A. 2014 9194–9210"/&gt; if logjams are near to urban areas this can lead to wood being trapped against bridge piers or blocking culverts.

===Off-line techniques===
[[File:Rain garden overview.jpg|thumb|A rain garden in [[Singapore]]]]
As part of a stream restoration project, [[stormwater]] management facilities may be installed in the immediate corridor or in upland areas. These facilities, which reduce the velocity and/or the volume of stormwater entering the stream channel, can also improve water quality, and include:
*[[Bioretention]] systems and [[rain garden]]s
*[[Constructed wetland]]s
*[[Infiltration basin]]s
*[[Retention basin]]s.

==Monitoring of restoration projects==
Sponsors of restoration projects may conduct [[Aquatic biomonitoring|monitoring]] of stream conditions after construction, to evaluate effectiveness. In some projects it may take considerable time before there is evidence of desired biological activity, such as fish [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]]. Therefore, monitoring efforts may be conducted for several years after a restoration project has completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/water/restoration/monitoring.html |title=Restoration Monitoring |publisher=MCDEP |access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Practical River Restoration Appraisal Guidance for Monitoring Options" is a guidance document that aims to assist all practitioners in the process of setting monitoring protocols as part of a river restoration project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therrc.co.uk/rrc_pragmo.php |title=Practical River Restoration Appraisal Guidance for Monitoring Options (PRAGMO) |publisher=River Restoration Centre (RRC)|location=Cranfield, Bedfordshire, UK |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information resources==
The River Restoration Centre, based at Cranfield University, is responsible for the National River Restoration Inventory which is used to document best practice in river watercourse and floodplain restoration, enhancement and management efforts in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.therrc.co.uk/rrc_nrri.php |title=National River Restoration Inventory|publisher=RRC |accessdate=2014-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.therrc.co.uk/rrc_manual.php |title=Manual of River Restoration Techniques|publisher=RRC |accessdate=2014-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
A '''tension-leg platform''' (TLP) or '''extended tension leg platform''' (ETLP) is a vertically [[geotechnical engineering#Floating-moored structures|moored floating structure]] normally used for the offshore production of [[crude oil|oil]] or [[natural gas|gas]], and is particularly suited for water depths greater than 300 metres (about 1000&amp;nbsp;ft) and less than 1500 metres (about 4900&amp;nbsp;ft). Use of tension-leg platforms has also been proposed for wind turbines.

The platform is permanently moored by means of tethers or tendons grouped at each of the structure's corners. A group of tethers is called a tension leg. A feature of the design of the tethers is that they have relatively high [[Axis of rotation|axial]] [[stiffness]] (low [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]), such that virtually all vertical motion of the platform is eliminated. This allows the platform to have the production [[wellhead]]s on deck (connected directly to the subsea wells by rigid risers), instead of on the [[seafloor]]. This allows a simpler [[well completion]] and gives better control over the production from the [[Petroleum|oil]] or [[gas]] [[oil reservoir|reservoir]], and easier access for downhole intervention operations.

TLPs have been in use since the early 1980s. The first tension leg platform&lt;ref name=RECTLPHUT&gt;[http://everything.but.architecture.pagesperso-orange.fr/Oilrig/oilrig.htm Reconversion d’une plate-forme offshore]&lt;/ref&gt; was built for Conoco's [[Hutton oilfield|Hutton field]] in the North Sea in the early 1980s. The hull was built in the dry-dock at Highland Fabricator's Nigg yard in the north of Scotland, with the deck section built nearby at McDermott's yard at Ardersier. The two parts were mated in the Moray Firth in 1984.

The Hutton TLP was originally designed for a service life of 25 years in Nord Sea depth of 100 to 1000 metres. It had 16 tension legs. Its weight varied between 46,500 and 55,000 tons when moored to the seabed, but up to 61,580 tons when floating freely.&lt;ref name=RECTLPHUT/&gt; The total area of its living quarters was about 3,500 square metres and accommodated over a 100 cabins though only 40 people were necessary to maintain the structure in place.&lt;ref name=RECTLPHUT/&gt;

The hull of the Hutton TLP has been separated from the topsides. Topsides have been redeployed to the [[Prirazlomnoye field]] in the Barents Sea, while the hull was reportedly sold to a project in the Gulf of Mexico (although the hull has been moored in Cromarty Firth since 2009).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oilrig-photos.com/picture/number1709.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Larger TLPs will normally have a full drilling rig on the platform with which to drill and intervene on the wells. The smaller TLPs may have a workover rig, or in a few cases no production wellheads located on the platform at all.

The deepest (E)TLPs measured from the sea floor to the surface are:&lt;ref&gt;https://portal.mustangeng.com/pls/portal30/docs/FOLDER/MUSTANGENG/INDUSTRY_POSTERS_CONTENT/2007_07_DSRPOSTER.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use for wind turbines==
Although the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] explored the concept of TLPs for [[Floating wind turbine|offshore wind turbines]] in September 2006, architects had studied the idea as early as 2003.&lt;ref name=RECTLPHUT/&gt; Earlier offshore wind turbines cost more to produce, stood on towers dug deep into the ocean floor, were only possible in depths of at most {{convert|50|ft|m}}, and generated 1.5 megawatts for onshore units and 3.5 megawatts for conventional offshore setups. In contrast, TLP installation was calculated to cost a third as much. TLPs float, and researchers estimate they can operate in depths between 100 and {{convert|650|ft|m}} and farther away from land, and they can generate 5.0 megawatts.&lt;ref name=FLOW&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/technology/060918_floating_windmills.html Floating Ocean Windmills Designed to Generate More Power]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Computer simulation]]s project that in a [[hurricane]] TLPs would shift 0.9 m to 1.8 m and the turbine blades would cycle above wave peaks. MIT and NREL researchers say dampers could be used to reduce motion in the event of a [[natural disaster]].&lt;ref name=FLOW/&gt;

MIT and NREL researchers plan to install a half-scale prototype south of [[Cape Cod]]. Sclavounos said, "We'd have a little unit sitting out there to show that this thing can float and behave the way we're saying it will."&lt;ref name=FLOW/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

[[File:FireAntBite.jpg|thumb|Formation of pustules on a human leg]]

Reactions seen in humans vary; some are hypersensitive to venom while others show resilience. [[Hypersensitivity]] can be attributed to certain medical problems such as heart conditions or diabetes. Bacterial infections attributed to sting injuries also pose a problem and may require further medical attention. Most humans can withstand many stings, but others may suffer from severe reactions such as anaphylaxis.&lt;ref name="Drees_2002"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drees|first1=B.M.|title=Medical problems and treatment considerations for the red imported fire ant|url=https://fireant.tamu.edu/files/2011/12/FAPFS023_2002rev_Medical.pdf|work=Texas Imported Fire Ant Research and Management Project|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University|accessdate=23 August 2016|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who are stung by red imported fire ants may experience intense local burning or flare-ups, followed by reddening of the skin at the sting site. This area will swell into a bump, hive or [[Cutaneous condition#Primary lesions|vesicle]] within 20 minutes. White fluid-filled sterile pustules begin to form within hours or days after being stung.&lt;ref name="Drees_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Xu_et_al_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schneiderman|first1=P. |last2=Grossman|first2=M.|title=A Clinician's Guide to Dermatologic Differential Diagnosis, Volume 1: The Text |date=2006|publisher=CRC Press |location=New York|isbn=978-0-203-09052-7|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Potiwat |first1=R.|last2=Sitcharungsi |first2=R.|title=Ant allergens and hypersensitivity reactions in response to ant stings|journal=Asian Pacific Journal of Allergy and Immunology |date=2015|volume=33|issue=4|pages=267–275|pmid=26708389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pustules on the skin remain for a couple of days, and may become infected which would require medical attention. In most cases, pustules dry up in a matter of weeks and leave brown scars that either remain for several months or become permanent.&lt;ref name="Drees_2002"/&gt; The formation of pustules occurs in almost every person stung by the ants. In one study, 96% of participants reported the formation of pustules, whereas 2% reported large local reactions.&lt;ref name="Tracy_et_al_1995"/&gt; Between 17% to 56% of people stung develop venom-specific [[Immunoglobulin E|IgE]]. Many of them will experience pruritic lumps around areas where the ants stung, known as late-phase responses or cutaneous allergic reactions.&lt;ref name="deShazo_et_al_1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stafford|first1=C.T.|title=Fire ant allergy|journal=Allergy Proceedings|date=1992|volume=13|issue=1|pages=11–16|pmid=1577260|doi=10.2500/108854192778878971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caro_et_al_1957"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Caro|first1=M.R.|last2=Derbes|first2=V.J.|last3=Jung|first3=R.|title=Skin responses to the sting of the imported fire ant (''Solenopsis Saevissima'')|journal=Archives of Dermatology|date=1957|volume=75|issue=4|pages=475–488|doi=10.1001/archderm.1957.01550160001001|pmid=13410107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pustule formation can only be prevented if the ants are removed before they have a chance to sting. Once venom has been injected, pustules will form and no form of treatment will prevent them from occurring. Medications such as antibiotics, [[2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine|diphenylhydrazines]], [[epinephrine]]s or [[topical steroids]] will not affect pustular reactions.&lt;ref name="Drees_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caro_et_al_1957"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parrino|first1=J.|last2=Kandawalla|first2=N.M.|last3=Lockey |first3=R.F.|title=Treatment of local skin response to imported fire ant sting |journal=Southern Medical Journal|date=1981 |volume=74 |issue=11 |pages=1361–1364 |pmid=7302637 |doi=10.1097/00007611-198111000-00017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anaphylaxis occurs in 0.6 to 6% of people who have been stung by the ants, and it can be fatal if left untreated.&lt;ref name="Prahlow_Barnard_1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deShazo_et_al_1999"/&gt; Typical symptoms of anaphylaxis include dizziness, headaches, fever, severe chest pain, nausea, severe sweating, low blood pressure, loss of breath, serious swelling, and slurred speech.&lt;ref name="Drees_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Xu_et_al_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/insects/fireants.html|title=Insects and Scorpions – Fire Ants |accessdate=11 April 2008|date=2008|work=The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160922153947/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/insects/fireants.html|archivedate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One case reports a victim feeling strong [[vertigo]] 5 to 10 minutes after being stung, followed by glassy eyes, dry mouth, paleness, unconsciousness and severe cramps on the sting sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haddad Junior|first1=V.|last2=Larsson |first2=C.E.|title=Anaphylaxis caused by stings from the ''Solenopsis invicta'', lava-pés ant or red imported fire ant|journal=Anais Brasileiros de Dermatologia|date=2015|volume=90|issue=3 |pages=22–25|doi=10.1590/abd1806-4841.20153420 |pmid=26312665|pmc=4540499}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Peripheral neuropathy|neuropathy]], seizures (even without any evidence of prior systemic reactions), [[Stroke|cerebrovascular accidents]], and [[nephrotic syndrome]] have been associated with red imported fire ant stings.&lt;ref name="Drees_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deShazo_et_al_1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Candiotti|first1=Keith A.|last2=Lamas|first2=Ana M.|title=Adverse neurologic reactions to the sting of the imported fire ant |journal=International Archives of Allergy and Immunology|date=1993|volume=102|issue=4 |pages=417–420 |doi=10.1159/000236592 |pmid=8241804}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of [[neurotoxin]]s have been identified in red imported fire ant venom, which may explain why some victims experience hallucinations after they have been stung.&lt;ref name="Gebel_2012"/&gt;

==Treatment==

{{main|Allergen immunotherapy}}
[[File:Adrenalina.jpg|thumb|left|Adrenaline (also called epinephrine) can quickly reverse the adverse events of dyspnoea and hypotension]]

It is suggested that a conservative approach be used when treating sting injuries; specifically, the kind of treatment used should be based on the symptoms. For minor sting injuries, with symptoms only including pustule formations and pain, over-the-counter products are available to prevent infection. Ants should be removed by washing the area with antiseptic soap, and itchiness. It is rare for ant sting sites to become infected, so the use of antibiotic prophylaxis is not always required.&lt;ref name="Drees_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pesek_Lockey_2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pesek|first1=R.D.|last2=Lockey|first2=R.F.|title=Management of insect sting hypersensitivity: an update|journal=Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology Research|date=2013|volume=5|issue=3|pages=129–137|doi=10.4168/aair.2013.5.3.129|pmid=23638310|pmc=3636446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims who show signs of anaphylaxis are treated with antihistamines, [[epinephrine]]s, and parenteral corticosteroids.&lt;ref name="deShazo_et_al_1999"/&gt; Epinephrine is the first product for use to treat systemic allergic responses, particularly if a patient is experiencing [[dyspnoea]] or [[hypotension]] because it is capable of reversing adverse events quickly and is very safe to use. It is recommended that people who have suffered from anaphylaxis carry an [[epinephrine autoinjector]] (EpiPen), should dyspnoea or hypotension begin to occur.&lt;ref name="Solley_et_al_2002"/&gt;

Whole body extract immunotherapy (WBE) to treat victims of anaphylaxis has been in use since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moffitt |first1=J.E. |last2=Barker|first2=J.R.|last3=Stafford |first3=C.T.|title=Management of imported fire ant allergy: Results of a survey |journal=Annals of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology |date=1997|volume=79|issue=2|pages=125–130 |doi=10.1016/S1081-1206(10)63098-0 |pmid=9291416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Triplett|first1=R.F.|title=Sensitivity to the imported fire ant: successful treatment with immunotherapy |journal=Southern Medical Journal|date=1973|volume=66|issue=4|pages=477–480 |pmid=4708246 |doi=10.1097/00007611-197304000-00019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone who has a suspected allergy to the venom is redirected to an allergist for assessment.&lt;ref name="Drees_2002"/&gt; The treatment uses the entire body of the ant and not just the venom, and unlike fire ant venom immunotherapy (which is occasionally used), WBE contains venom proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nordvall|first1=S.L.|last2=Johansson|first2=S.G.|last3=Ledford|first3=D.K.|last4=Lockey|first4=R.F.|title=Allergens of the imported fire ant.|journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=1988|volume=82|issue=4|pages=567–576 |pmid=3171000|doi=10.1016/0091-6749(88)90966-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce a patient's sensitivity to the venom, gradual increases of dose extracts are injected into the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Allergies: Insect Sting Allergy|url=http://acaai.org/allergies/types/insect-sting-allergies|publisher=American College of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; WBE immunotherapy appears to be very effective in preventing systemic reactions; in one study of participants who completed WBE immunotherapy, two out of fifteen participants suffered from allergic reactions upon being stung 18 months after immunotherapy.&lt;ref name="Pesek_Lockey_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=T.|last2=Hylander|first2=R. |last3=Ortiz|first3=A.|last4=Martin|first4=M.|title=Imported fire ant immunotherapy: Effectiveness of whole body extracts|journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=1992|volume=90|issue=2 |pages=210–215|doi=10.1016/0091-6749(92)90073-B|pmid=1500625}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paull|first1=B.R.|title=Imported fire ant allergy.

Newborn or young livestock can be blinded or killed when attacked by the ants.&lt;ref name="Drees_et_al_2002"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drees|first1=B.M.|last2=Jensen|first2=J.M. |last3=Joyce|first3=J.R.|last4=Barr|first4=C.L. |last5=Reagor|first5=J.C.|title=Diagnosing and treating animals for red imported fire ant injury|url=http://fireant.tamu.edu/files/2013/02/FAPFS022.2002rev.pdf|work=Texas Imported Fire Ant Research and Management Project|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University|accessdate=30 March 2016|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Capinera|2008|p=189}} Healthy individuals are less likely to be attacked than weak or sick animals. Red [[papule]] and mild swelling occur, followed by vesicopustule with a red halo developing within 24 to 48 hours. The eyes and eyelids are commonly damaged from the stings; in sheep and goats, ophthalmic ointment containing antibiotics and corticosteroids can be used to treat the eyes of sheep and goats, but this treatment is not recommended for horses. In non-domestic animals, cases of red imported fire ants stings in animals such as ferrets, moles squirrels, white-tailed deer, cottontail rabbits, and newborn blackbucks have been reported, as well as lizards and screech owl nestlings. The aftermath of the injuries is like those in domestic animals.&lt;ref name="Drees_et_al_2002"/&gt;

Red imported fire ants are known to actively kill vertebrate animals, and cause significant livestock losses.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, C.T. (1986) Agricultural and medical impact of the imported fire ants. In: Lofgren, C.S. and Vander Meer, R.K. (eds) Fire Ants and Leq.fcutting Ants: Biology and Management. Westview Press, Boulder, Colorado, pp. 48-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Animals may trigger major stinging episodes when they disturb active nests, with thousands of ants participating in the attack. During such episodes an animal may suffer from hundreds to thousands of individual stings. It is suspected that many victims of the red imported fire ants may be [[Animal psychopathology#Depression|depressed]] as a result of the effects of the toxin. Some animals may swallow red imported fire ants as they lick or bite around the sites they are stinging. This can cause additional injuries inside the animal itself, especially in the upper gastrointestinal tract. In suckling white tail deer fawns, sting sites have been found in the oesophagus and [[abomasum]]; toxins from the ingested ants may cause inflammation of the gastrointestinal lining.&lt;ref name="Drees_et_al_2002"/&gt;

A '''tragic hero''' is the [[protagonist]] of a [[tragedy]] in [[dramas]].  In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] records the descriptions of the tragic hero to the playwright and strictly defines the place that the tragic hero must play and the kind of man he must be. Aristotle based his observations on previous dramas.&lt;ref&gt; Aristotle, On Poetics, Ingram Bywater&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the most famous instances of tragic heroes appear in [[Greek literature]], most notably the works of [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]. Others, like the contemporary tragedy of J.P. Carney, happen in the ordinary confinements of our own world, bespeaking to the hubris of the modern man in the age of technology and leg day.

==Aristotle's tragic hero==

In ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle suggests that the hero of a tragedy must evoke a sense of pity or fear within the audience, stating that “the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity."&lt;ref&gt;S.H. Butcher, The Poetic of Aristotle (1902), pp. 45-47&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the focus of the hero should not be the loss of his [[prosperity]]. He establishes the concept that [[pity]] is an emotion that must be elicited when, through his actions, the character receives undeserved misfortune, while the emotion of [[fear]] must be felt by the audience when they contemplate that such misfortune could possibly befall themselves in similar situations. Aristotle explains such change of fortune "should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.” Such misfortune is visited upon the tragic hero "not through vice or depravity but by some error of judgment." This error, or [[hamartia]], refers to a flaw in the character of the hero, or a mistake made by the character.

An example of a mistake made by a tragic hero can be found in Sophocles' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''. In the story, the character of Oedipus is given a prophecy that he will murder his own father and marry his own mother. Although he goes to great lengths to avoid fulfilling the prophecy, Oedipus learns that the life of a man he took, Laius, was actually that of his own father, and that the woman to which he is married, Jocasta, is actually his own mother.

[[Creon]] of Sophocles' ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'' is another notable example of a tragic hero. Polyneices and his brother, Eteocles, were kings, and the former wanted more power, so he left and assembled an army from a neighboring city. They attacked and the two brothers killed each other. Through Creon's law forbidding the burial of [[Polyneices]], Creon dooms his own family. Other examples provided by Aristotle include [[Thyestes]].

Therefore, the Aristotelian hero is characterized as virtuous but not "eminently good," which suggests a noble or important personage who is upstanding and morally inclined while nonetheless subject to [[human error]]. Aristotle's tragic heroes are flawed individuals who commit, without evil intent, great wrongs or injuries that ultimately lead to their misfortune, often followed by tragic realization of the true nature of events that led to this destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Reeves, The Aristotelian Concept of The Tragic Hero, Vol. 73, No. 2 (1952), Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/291812 pp. 172-188&lt;/ref&gt; This means the hero still must be – to some degree – morally grounded. The usual [[irony]] in Greek tragedy is that the hero is both extraordinarily capable and highly moral (in the Greek [[honor]]-culture sense of being duty-bound to moral expectations), and it is these exact, highly-admirable qualities that lead the hero into tragic circumstances.  The tragic hero is snared by his or her own greatness: extraordinary competence, a righteous passion for duty, and (often) the arrogance associated with greatness ([[hubris]]).

==In other media==
The influence of the Aristotelian hero extends past [[Classical Greece|classical Greek]] [[literary criticism]]. Greek theater had a direct and profound influence on Roman theater and formed the basis of Western theater that continues into the modern era, deeply influencing a wide variety of arts throughout the world, in diverse mediums such as literature, music, film, television and even video games. Many iconic characters featured in these genres follow the archetype of the tragic hero. Examples of such characters include [[Anakin Skywalker]] from George Lucas'  ''[[Star_Wars#Prequel_trilogy|Star Wars]]'' films, Okonkwo from Nigerian author Chinua Achebe's novel ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'', Arthas Menethil from the video game franchise ''[[Warcraft]]'', and [[Stannis Baratheon]] from [[George R. R. Martin]]'s novel series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' and the HBO television series adaptation ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. Some film historians regard [[Michael Corleone]] of ''[[The Godfather (film series)|The Godfather]]'' a tragic hero, although using traditional literary conventions, the character would more closely fit the role of [[villain]], not tragic hero.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/handv.aspx AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023071414/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/handv.aspx |date=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Optical Triangulation Sensors''' are commonly used to provide door mounted safety detection on swinging [[automatic door]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.

In [[North America]], these types of sensors are very common and manufactured in very high volumes.  When automatic swinging doors open and close, it is important that they do not come into contact with pedestrians passing through the door.

Sensors used in the automatic door industry typically fall into four categories:
#Microwave sensors used to detect motion of a person as they approach an automatic door,
#Reflective optical sensors that are mounted on the door header and detect the presence of a person in the door path
#Camera based sensors that are also mounted on the door header and similarly detect presence; and
#Triangulation sensors which are mounted on the door and move with the door to provide safety.

Reflective and camera technologies do not perform well on moving swing doors, because they typically depend upon detection of changes in the background.  A sensor mounted on a swing door system is constantly in motion, so the background (i.e. floor beneath the door) changes continuously.   A triangulation sensor overcomes this problem.

==Triangulation Sensor Functionality==
In most cases an optical triangulation sensor is mounted near the top of the swinging door frame, inside a long extruded aluminum tube with an optical window facing the floor.  An {{nowrap|880 nm}} [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] light source emits a collimated, [[near-infrared]] light beam.  The beam bounces off the floor and is received by a [[photodiode]] positioned adjacent to the LED source.  A second photodiode (or a linear array of photodiodes) is positioned farther along the length of the sensor.  

When the emitted beam bounces off the floor, the reflected energy is almost exclusively concentrated on the first adjacent photodiode.  When a human or object moves into the optical path, the reflected beam bounces back from the object.  Since the beam is no longer traveling the full optical path length to the floor, its reflected angle changes.  One of the adjacent photodiodes then receives the optical energy and the sensor responds by sending a signal to the automatic door controller.  At that point the door stops, slows or reverses, hence averting a collision and providing safety.

Triangulation sensors are found on a number of door brands and manufactured by several sensor manufacturers.  One example is the SuperScan-II from BEA. Other products from other manufacturers are also available.
