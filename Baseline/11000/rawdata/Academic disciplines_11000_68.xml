== History ==
[[File:Center for Jewish History NYC.jpg|thumbnail|175px|left|The Center for Jewish History on 16th Street]]
The American Jewish Historical Society is the oldest national ethnic historical organization in the United States. The Society's library, archives, photograph, and art and artifacts collections document the American Jewish experience. They are housed in the [[Center for Jewish History]] in Manhattan.&lt;ref name=AmericanJudaism-Sarna-2004&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sarna|first1=Jonathan D.|title=American Judaism: A History|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=978-0-300-10197-3|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/american-judaism-a-history/oclc/52509494/viewport|accessdate=22 November 2015|quote= |OCLC=52509494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society has administrative offices in both [[New York, New York]], and in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. It has served as a public educational and interpretive function by publishing a journal, a newsletter, monographs and reference works on the American Jewish experience.

In 2007, it was among over 530 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation]], which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes-BloombergGift-2005&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Sam|title=City Groups Get Bloomberg Gift of $20 Million|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/nyregion/city-groups-get-bloomberg-gift-of-20-million.html|accessdate=22 November 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=6 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler: With Predictions of His Future Behavior and Suggestions for Dealing with Him Now and After Germany's Surrender''''' was a report prepared by [[Henry A. Murray]] for the [[United States]] [[Office of Strategic Services]] during [[World War II]]. It was one of two [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] reports prepared for the OSS on [[Nazi Germany]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]]; the other was "A Psychological Analysis of Adolph Hitler: His Life and Legend" (later published in book form under the title ''[[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]]'').

Murray's report is dated October 1943. [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/n/nur/analysis.php A copy in PDF is available] from the [[Cornell Law School]] library, which received copyright permission to publish the report online from Murray's family in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/n/nur/pdf/62043_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Cornell copy is serialized as copy number 3 of 30. The report forms a part of the law library's Donovan Collection, which contains the papers of the OSS chief [[William J. Donovan]].

==History==
Murray prepared the report, which consists of the following:

*6 unnumbered pages of [http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/library/WhatWeHave/SpecialCollections/Donovan/Hitler/upload/Vol_XC_PRF.pdf ''Introductory Material''] (consisting of a cover page, a foreword and a table of contents)&lt;ref&gt;The report's organization is confusing. The table of contents in the ''Introductory Material'' refers to Sections 4, 5 and 6, but these sections do not exist; instead, the material for those non-existent sections appears as Parts B, C and D of Section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Section 1 (pages numbered 1-53) entitled a [http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/library/WhatWeHave/SpecialCollections/Donovan/Hitler/upload/Vol_XC_Sec_1.pdf  ''Condensed Review of the Entire Memorandum''],&lt;ref&gt;The title of Section 1 (a "Condensed Review") is confusing, as it is essentially the heart of the entire memorandum, and is not a review of some more complete document.&lt;/ref&gt; which contains
**Part A (pages 1–29), ''Brief Analysis of Hitler's Personality''
**Part B (pages 29 – 33), ''Predictions of Hitler's Behavior''
**Part C (pages 33 – 38), ''Suggestions for the Treatment of Hitler''
**Part D (pages 38 – 53), ''Suggestions for the Treatment of the German People''
*Section 2, a work by W.H.D. Vernon (numbered as pages 54 – 81) entitled [http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/library/WhatWeHave/SpecialCollections/Donovan/Hitler/upload/Vol_XC_Sec_2.pdf Hitler the Man - Notes for a Case Study]
*Section 3 (numbered as pages 82 – 227) [http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/library/WhatWeHave/SpecialCollections/Donovan/Hitler/upload/Vol_XC_Sec_3.pdf appearing here], which is intended for "psychologists and psychiatrists."

The sources for the report, identified in the introductory material, are all published sources, including the paper which was prepared by Vernon (Section 2) under Murray's general supervision. Unlike the report prepared by Langer (see ''[[The Mind of Adolf Hitler]]''), Murray conducted no personal interviews of Hitler associates.

There is some overlap between the two wartime reports. Murray's biographer claims that Langer copied from Murray without giving proper credit.

'''Antonelli College''' is a [[for-profit college|for-profit]] [[career education|career training school]] with a main campus located in [[Cincinnati]]. Founded in 1947 as the Gebhardt Art School, the college later switched its name to Ohio Visual Art Institute in the mid-1970s then renaming itself to Antonelli College in 1982. In 2016, Antonelli College was ranked one of the top ten most expensive two-year colleges in Ohio&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collegecalc.org/colleges/ohio/antonelli-college-cincinnati/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accreditation ==
Antonelli College is accredited by the [[Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges]] (ACCSC).

== History ==
Antonelli College established itself as part of the visual arts community in [[Cincinnati]], in 1947 when the school opened its doors as the Gebhardt Art School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thebestcolleges.org/schools/online/antonelli-college-online/ | title=Antonelli College Online | publisher=thebestcolleges.org | accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1970s, the college was renamed the Ohio Visual Art Institute until 1982 when it became Antonelli College.

In the 1990s, degree programs were added in business office technology, and in January 2005, programs in the health information technology field as well as massage therapy were added. Branches in [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] and [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi]], were added in January 1996, and in 2009, the [[West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio|West Chester, Ohio]], branch became the newest addition to the Antonelli College family. In 2008, an online option was also created for distance learners.

The founding campus located in [[Cincinnati]], in the urban downtown area.  

March 2016, Antonelli College's Practical Nursing Program at the Cincinnati campus was suspended by the Ohio Board of Nursing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wcpo.com/news/education/ohio-board-of-nursing-revokes-approval-for-antonelli-program | title=Ohio nursing board revokes approval for Antonelli program | publisher=WCPO-TV | date=Mar 30, 2016 | accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4785">'''Atmospheric optics ray tracing codes'''  - this article list codes for light scattering using ray-tracing technique to study atmospheric optics phenomena such as rainbows and halos. Such particles can be large raindrops or hexagonal ice crystals.  Such codes are one of many approaches to calculations of [[light scattering by particles]].

==Geometric optics (ray tracing)==
{{main article|Geometric optics}}
Ray tracing techniques can be applied to study light scattering by spherical and non-spherical particles under the condition that the size of a particle is much larger than the wavelength of light. The light can be considered as collection of separate rays with width of rays much larger than the wavelength but smaller than a particle. Rays hitting the particle undergoes reflection, refraction and diffraction. These rays exit in various directions with different amplitudes and phases. Such ray tracing techniques are used to describe optical phenomena such as [[rainbow]]  of [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] on hexagonal ice crystals for large particles. 
Review of several mathematical techniques is provided in series of publications.

The 46° halo was first explained as being caused by refractions through ice crystals in 1679 by the French physicist [[Edme Mariotte|Edmé Mariotte]] (1620–1684) in terms of light refraction &lt;ref&gt;E. Mariotte, ''Quatrieme Essay.  De la Nature des Couleur'' (Paris, France:  Estienne Michallet, 1681).  Sun dogs as well as the 22° and 46° halos are explained in terms of refractions from ice crystals on [https://books.google.com/books?id=y10O12JjHskC&amp;pg=PA466#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 466 - 524].&lt;/ref&gt; 
Jacobowitz in 1971 was the first to apply the ray-tracing technique to hexagonal ice crystal. Wendling et al. (1979) extended Jacobowitz's work from  hexagonal ice particle with infinite length to finite length and combined Monte Carlo technique to the ray-tracing simulations.

It is widely agreed that reaching this goal is very difficult and that even the best-regarded recording and playback systems rarely, if ever, achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Audiophile values may be applied at all stages of music reproduction: the initial [[audio recording]], the production process, and the playback, which is usually in a home setting. In general, the values of an audiophile are seen to be antithetical to the growing popularity of more convenient but lower quality music, especially lossy digital file types like [[MP3]], lower definition streaming services, and inexpensive headphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Audio playback components==
An audio system typically consists of one or more source components, one or more amplification components, and (for [[stereophonic sound|stereo]]) two or more [[loudspeaker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.mediacollege.com/audio/01/sound-systems.html
 |title=Sound Systems
 |publisher=Media college.com
 |accessdate=3 July 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Audio and video connector|Signal cables]] (analog audio, speaker, digital audio etc.) are used to link these components. There are also a variety of accessories, including equipment racks, [[power conditioner]]s, devices to reduce or control [[vibration]], record cleaners, anti-static devices, phonograph needle cleaners, [[reverberation]] reducing devices such as speaker pads and stands, sound absorbent foam, and [[soundproofing]].

The interaction between the loudspeakers and the room ([[room acoustics]]) plays an important part in sound quality. Sound vibrations are reflected from walls, floor and ceiling, and are affected by the contents of the room. Room dimensions can create [[standing wave]]s at particular (usually low) frequencies.  There are devices and materials for [[Acoustic treatment#Absorption|room treatment]] that affect sound quality. Soft materials, such as draperies and carpets, can absorb higher frequencies, whereas hard walls and floors can cause excess reverberation.

=== Sound sources ===
Audiophiles play music from a wide variety of sources including [[phonograph record]]s, [[compact disc]]s (CDs), and digital [[audio file format]]s that are uncompressed as well as ones that are compressed using [[lossless data compression]] such as [[FLAC]], [[Windows Media Audio 9 Lossless]] and [[Apple Lossless|Apple Lossless (ALAC)]].  Since the early 1990s, CDs have become the most common source of high-quality music. Nevertheless, [[Phonograph#Turntable technology|turntables]], tonearms, and [[magnetic cartridge]]s are still used, despite the difficulties of keeping records free from dust and the delicate set-up associated with turntables.

The 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz [[sampling rate]] of the CD format, in theory, restricts CD information losses to above the theoretical upper-frequency limit of [[human hearing]] – 20&amp;nbsp;kHz, see [[Nyquist limit]].  Despite this, newer formats such as [[DVD-Audio]] and [[Super Audio CD|Super Audio Compact Disc]] (SACD), have sampling rates of 88.2&amp;nbsp;kHz or 96&amp;nbsp;kHz or even higher.

CD audio signals are encoded in 16-bit values. Some higher-definition consumer formats such as HDCD-encoded CDs contain 20-bit and even 24-bit audio streams. With more bits more [[dynamic range]] is possible; 20 bit dynamic range is theoretically 120&amp;nbsp;dB—the limit of most consumer electronic playback equipment.&lt;ref name="HuberRunstein2005"&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Recording Techniques, Sixth Edition |last=Huber |first=David Miles |author2=Robert E. Runstein |year=2005 |publisher=Focal Press |isbn=0-240-80625-5 |pages=130 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mounFTvtYOQC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MP3 encoding, widely used in portable audio devices, is an example of [[Audio compression (data)#Lossy audio compression|lossy compression]].

=== Amplifiers ===
A [[preamplifier]] selects among several audio inputs, amplifies source-level signals (such as those from a turntable), and allows the listener to adjust the sound with volume and tone controls. Many audiophile-oriented preamplifiers lack tone controls. A power [[amplifier]] takes the "line-level" audio signal from the preamplifier and drives the [[loudspeaker]]s. An integrated amplifier combines the functions of power amplification with input switching and volume and tone control.  Both pre/power combinations and integrated amplifiers are widely used by audiophiles.

Audiophile amplifiers are available based on solid-state ([[semiconductor]]) technology, [[vacuum tube|vacuum-tube]] (valve) technology, or hybrid technology&amp;mdash;semiconductors and vacuum tubes.

Dedicated amplifiers are also commonly used by audiophiles to drive headphones, especially those with high impedance and/or low sensitivity, or [[electrostatic headphones]].

=== Loudspeakers ===
The cabinet of the loudspeaker is known as the [[loudspeaker enclosure|enclosure]].  There are a variety of loudspeaker enclosure designs, including sealed cabinets ([[acoustic suspension]]), ported cabinets ([[bass-reflex]]), transmission line, infinite baffle, and horn loaded. The enclosure plays a major role in the sound of the loudspeaker.

The drivers that produce the sound are referred to as [[tweeter]]s, [[Mid-range speaker|midrange]]s, and [[woofer]]s. Driver designs include dynamic, electrostatic, plasma, ribbon, planar, ionic, and servo-actuated. Drivers are made from a variety of materials including paper pulp, polypropylene, kevlar, aluminum, magnesium, beryllium, and vapor-deposited diamond.

The direction and intensity of the output of a loudspeaker, called dispersion or polar response, has a large effect on its sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=The 'Best' Loudspeaker: Revisiting Dispersion Issues
 |publisher=EnjoyTheMusic.com
 |date=May 1999
 |accessdate=3 July 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various methods are employed to control the dispersion.  These methods include monopolar, bipolar, dipolar, 360-degree, horn, waveguide, and line source. These terms refer to the configuration and arrangement of the various drivers in the enclosure.

The positioning of loudspeakers in the room has a strong influence on the sound experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=Getting the Best from Your Loudspeakers

 |first=John
 |last=Atkinson
 |date=3 October 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loudspeaker output is influenced by interaction with room boundaries, particularly bass response, and high frequency transducers are directional, or "beaming".

=== Accessories ===
Audiophiles use a wide variety of accessories and fine-tuning techniques, sometimes referred to as "tweaks", to improve the sound of their systems. These include filters to "clean" the electricity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.audioholics.com/reviews/power-conditioners
 |title=Power Conditioner Reviews
 |publisher=Audioholics
}}&lt;/ref&gt; equipment racks to isolate components from floor vibrations, specialty power and audio cables, loudspeaker stands (and footers to isolate speakers from stands), and room treatments.

There are several types of room treatment. Sound-absorbing materials may be placed strategically within a listening room to reduce the amplitude of early reflections, and to deal with resonance modes.  Other treatments are designed to produce diffusion, reflection of sound in a scattered fashion. Room treatments can be expensive and difficult to optimize.

=== Headphones ===

Headphones are regularly used by audiophiles.  These products can be remarkably expensive, some over $10,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url        = http://gadgets.luxist.com/2005/12/14/sennheiser-he-90-headphones

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in general are much cheaper than comparable speaker systems. They have the advantage of not requiring room treatment, and being usable without requiring others to listen at the same time.  Newer [[Headphones#In-ear headphones|canalphones]] can be driven by the less powerful outputs found on portable music players.

=== Design variety ===

For music storage, [[digital audio|digital]] formats offer an absence of clicks, pops, [[wow (recording)|wow]], [[Flutter (electronics and communication)|flutter]], [[acoustic feedback]], and [[Rumble (noise)|rumble]], compared to vinyl records.  Depending on the format, digital can also have a higher [[signal-to-noise ratio]], a wider [[dynamic range]], less [[total harmonic distortion]], and a flatter and more extended [[frequency response]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mastersonaudio.com/audio/20030101.htm |title=The Decline of Vinyl and Its Timely Death |author=Ian G. Masters |date=1 January 2003 |journal=mastersonaudio.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050906014840/http://www.mastersonaudio.com/audio/20030101.htm |archivedate=6 September 2005 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Masters&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.soundstageav.com/mastersonaudio/20050415.htm |title=Vinyl Hooey |author=Ian G.

(Note that vinyl records may be mastered differently from their digital versions.)

In the amplification stage, [[vacuum tube|vacuum-tube]] electronics remain popular, despite most other applications having since abandoned tubes for [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] amplifiers.  Also vacuum-tube amplifiers often have higher [[total harmonic distortion]], require rebiasing, are less reliable, generate more heat, are less powerful, and cost more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mastersonaudio.com/audio/20020901.htm |title=The Ongoing Debate about Amplifier "Sound" |author=Ian G.

== Controversies ==

There is substantial controversy on the subject of audiophile components; many have asserted that the occasionally high cost  produces no measurable improvement in audio reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/29/lost-in-music-the-world-of-obsessive-audiophilia |title=Lost in music: the world of obsessive audiophilia |publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, skeptic [[James Randi]], through his foundation [[One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge]], has offered a prize of $1 million to anyone who can demonstrate that $7,250 audio cables "are any better than ordinary audio cables".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=James Randi Offers $1 Million If Audiophiles Can Prove $7250 Speaker Cables Are Better | year = 2005 | publisher=Gizmodo | url=https://gizmodo.com/gadgets/calling-bullshit/james-randi-offers-1-million-if-audiophiles-can-prove-7250-speaker-cables-are-better-305549.php | accessdate=6 January 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090202050901/http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/calling-bullshit/james-randi-offers-1-million-if-audiophiles-can-prove-7250-speaker-cables-are-better-305549.php| archivedate= 2 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, audio reviewer Michael Fremer attempted to claim the prize, and said that Randi declined the challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= The Swift Boating of Audiophiles | year = 2008 | publisher=Stereophile | url=http://www.stereophile.com/thinkpieces/021708swiftboat/ | accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Randi said that the cable manufacturer Pear Cables was the one who withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Blake Withdraws from PEAR Cable Challenge | year = 2007 | publisher=JREF | url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-news/102-blake-withdrawls-from-pear-cable-challenge.html | accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms usually focus on claims around so-called "tweaks" and accessories beyond the core source, amplification, and speaker products. Examples of these accessories include speaker cables, component interconnects, stones, cones, CD markers, and power cables or conditioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kinch |first=Bruce |url=http://www.enjoythemusic.com/Magazine/equipment/1000/cheaptweaks.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120730173933/http://www.enjoythemusic.com/Magazine/equipment/1000/cheaptweaks.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 July 2012 |title=Cheap Tweaks That Sound Like a Million Bucks!!! |year=2000 |publisher=Enjoy The Music |accessdate=7 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite web | last=Russell | first=Roger | url=http://www.roger-russell.com/wire/wire.htm | title=Speaker Wire - A History | year=1999–2007 | publisher= Roger Russell | accessdate=7 November 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071105093122/http://www.roger-russell.com/wire/wire.htm#gordongow| archivedate= 5 November 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is disagreement on how [[Audio equipment testing|equipment testing]] should be conducted and as to its utility.  Audiophile publications frequently describe differences in quality which are not detected by standard [[audio system measurements]] and double blind testing, claiming that they perceive differences in audio quality which cannot be measured by current instrumentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.stereophile.com/features/203/index11.html|title=''God is in the Nuances''
|accessdate=25 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and cannot be detected by listeners if listening conditions are [[Scientific control|controlled]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20693">'''Biodiversity Informatics''' is the application of [[informatics (academic field)|informatics]] techniques to [[biodiversity|biodiversity information]] for improved management, presentation, discovery, exploration and analysis. It typically builds on a foundation of [[Biological classification|taxonomic]], [[biogeography|biogeographic]], or [[ecology|ecological]] information stored in digital form, which, with the application of modern computer techniques, can yield new ways to view and analyse existing information, as well as predictive models for information that does not yet exist (see [[environmental niche modelling|niche modelling]]). Biodiversity informatics is a relatively young discipline (the term was coined in or around 1992) but has hundreds of practitioners worldwide, including the numerous individuals involved with the design and construction of [[taxonomic database]]s. The term "Biodiversity Informatics" is generally used in the broad sense to apply to computerized handling of any biodiversity information; the somewhat broader term "[[bioinformatics]]" is often used synonymously with the computerized handling of data in the specialized area of [[molecular biology]].

== Overview ==

Biodiversity informatics (different but linked to bioinformatics) is the application of information technology methods to the problems of organizing, accessing, visualizing and analyzing primary biodiversity data. Primary biodiversity data is composed of names, observations and records of specimens, and genetic and morphological data associated to a specimen. Biodiversity informatics may also have to cope with managing information from unnamed taxa such as that produced by environmental sampling and sequencing of mixed-field samples. The term biodiversity informatics is also used to cover the [[computational problem]]s specific to the names of biological entities, such as the development of algorithms to cope with variant representations of identifiers such as species names and authorities, and the multiple classification schemes within which these entities may reside according to the preferences of different workers in the field, as well as the syntax and semantics by which the content in taxonomic databases can be made machine queryable and interoperable for biodiversity informatics purposes...

== History of the discipline ==

Biodiversity Informatics can be considered to have commenced with the construction of the first computerized [[taxonomic database]]s in the early 1970s, and progressed through subsequent developing of distributed search tools towards the late 1990s including the Species Analyst from Kansas University, the North American Biodiversity Information Network NABIN, CONABIO in Mexico, and others,&lt;ref name="Krishtalka2000"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Krishtalka L, Humphrey PS|lastauthoramp=yes |year= 2000|title=Can Natural History Museums Capture the Future?|journal=BioScience|volume=50|pages=611–617|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/pdf/10.1641/0006-3568%282000%29050%5B0611%3ACNHMCT%5D2.0.CO%3B2|doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2000)050[0611:CNHMCT]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; the establishment of the [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]] in 2001, and the parallel development of a variety of [[niche modelling]] and other tools to operate on digitized biodiversity data from the mid-1980s onwards (e.g. see &lt;ref name="Peterson2001"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Peterson AT, Vieglais D|lastauthoramp=yes |year= 2001|title=Predicting Species Invasions Using Ecological Niche Modeling: New Approaches from Bioinformatics Attack a Pressing Problem|journal=BioScience|volume=51|pages=363–371|url=http://www.cria.org.br/eventos/mfmpe/19_20jun2002_docs/BioScience%202001.pdf|doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0363:PSIUEN]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In September 2000, the U.S. journal [[Science (journal)|Science]] devoted a special issue to "Bioinformatics for Biodiversity",&lt;ref name="Science_Sep_2000"&gt;{{cite journal|year= 2000|title=Bioinformatics for Biodiversity?|journal=Science|volume=289|pages=2229–2440|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol289/issue5488/index.dtl}}&lt;/ref&gt; the journal "Biodiversity Informatics" commenced publication in 2004, and several international conferences through the 2000s have brought together Biodiversity Informatics practitioners, including the London [http://www.e-biosphere09.org/ e-Biosphere] conference in June 2009. A supplement to the journal [[BMC Bioinformatics]] (Volume 10 Suppl 14&lt;ref name="BMC_Bioinformatics2009"&gt;{{cite journal|year= 2009|title=Biodiversity Informatics|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|volume=10 Suppl 14|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10?issue=S14}}&lt;/ref&gt;) published in November 2009 also deals with Biodiversity Informatics.

== History of the term ==

According to correspondence reproduced by Walter Berendsohn,&lt;ref name="BITheTerm"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bgbm.org/BioDivInf/TheTerm.htm| accessdate = 2009-08-06 | title = "Biodiversity Informatics", The Term}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term "Biodiversity Informatics" was coined by John Whiting in 1992 to cover the activities of an entity known as the Canadian Biodiversity Informatics Consortium, a group involved with fusing basic [[biodiversity]] information with [[environmental economics]] and geospatial information in the form of [[GPS]] and [[GIS]]. Subsequently, it appears to have lost any obligate connection with the GPS/GIS world and be associated with the computerized management of any aspects of biodiversity information (e.g. see &lt;ref name="Bisby2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bisby FA|year= 2000|title=The Quiet Revolution: Biodiversity Informatics and the Internet|journal=Science|volume=289|pages=2309–2312|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/289/5488/2309|doi=10.1126/science.289.5488.2309|pmid=11009408|issue=5488|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

== Current Biodiversity Informatics issues ==

=== Global list of all species ===

One major issue for biodiversity informatics at a global scale is the current absence of a complete master list of [[Global biodiversity|currently recognised species of the world]], although this is an aim of the [[Catalogue of Life]] project which has ca. 1.65 million species of an estimated 1.9 million described species in its [http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2016/info/ac 2016 Annual Checklist]. A similar effort for fossil taxa, the Paleobiology Database&lt;ref name="PaleoDB"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://paleodb.org/| accessdate = 2009-08-06 | title = the Paleobiology Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; documents some 100,000+ names for fossil species, out of an unknown total number.

=== Genus and species scientific names as unique identifiers ===

Application of the [[Linnaeus|Linnaean]] system of binomial nomenclature for [[species]], and uninomials for [[genus|genera]] and higher ranks, has led to many advantages but also problems with [[Homonym (biology)|homonyms]] (the same name being used for multiple taxa, either inadvertently or legitimately across multiple kingdoms), [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]] (multiple names for the same taxon), as well as variant representations of the same name due to orthographic differences, minor spelling errors, variation in the manner of citation of author names and dates, and more. In addition, names can change through time on account of changing taxonomic opinions (for example, the correct generic placement of a species, or the elevation of a subspecies to species rank or vice versa), and also the circumscription of a taxon can change according to different authors' taxonomic concepts. One proposed solution to this problem is the usage of Life Science Identifiers ([[LSID]]s) for machine-machine communication purposes, although there are both proponents and opponents of this approach.

=== A consensus classification of organisms ===

Organisms can be classified in a multitude of ways (see main page [[Biological classification]]), which can create design problems for Biodiversity Informatics systems aimed at incorporating either a single or multiple classification to suit the needs of users, or to guide them towards a single "preferred" system. Whether a single consensus classification system can ever be achieved is probably an open question, however the Catalogue of Life has commissioned activity in this area&lt;ref name="CoL2009Gordon"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.catalogueoflife.org/info_hierarchy.php|accessdate = 2009-08-06|title = Towards a management hierarchy (classification) for the Catalogue of Life. Draft Discussion Document by Dr. Dennis P. Gordon, May 2009|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090808201530/http://www.catalogueoflife.org/info_hierarchy.php|archivedate = 2009-08-08|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been succeeded by a published system proposed in 2015 by M. Ruggiero and co-workers.&lt;ref name="Ruggiero-et-al-2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ruggiero, M.A. |author2=Gordon, D.P. |author3=Orrell, T.M. |author4=Bailly, N.  |author5=Bourgoin, T. |author6=Brusca, R.C. |display-authors=etal |year=2015 |title=A higher level classification of all living organisms |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=10 | issue = 4  |pages=e0119248 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0119248 |pmid=25923521 |pmc=4418965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mobilizing primary biodiversity information ==

"Primary" biodiversity information can be considered the basic data on the occurrence and diversity of species (or indeed, any recognizable taxa), commonly in association with information regarding their distribution in either space, time, or both. Such information may be in the form of retained specimens and associated information, for example as assembled in the natural history collections of [[museum]]s and [[herbarium|herbaria]], or as observational records, for example either from formal faunal or floristic surveys undertaken by professional biologists and students, or as amateur and other planned or unplanned observations including those increasingly coming under the scope of [[citizen science]]. Providing online, coherent digital access to this vast collection of disparate primary data is a core Biodiversity Informatics function that is at the heart of regional and global biodiversity data networks, examples of the latter including [[OBIS]] and [[GBIF]].

As a secondary source of biodiversity data, relevant [[scientific literature]] can be parsed either by humans or (potentially) by specialized information retrieval algorithms to extract the relevant primary biodiversity information that is reported therein, sometimes in aggregated / summary form but frequently as primary observations in narrative or tabular form. Elements of such activity (such as extracting key taxonomic identifiers, keywording / [[index term]]s, etc.) have been practiced for many years at a higher level by selected [[academic databases and search engines]]. However, for the maximum Biodiversity Informatics value, the actual primary occurrence data should ideally be retrieved and then made available in a standardized form or forms; for example both the [[Plazi]] and [http://www.inotaxa.org/ INOTAXA] projects are transforming taxonomic literature into [[XML]] formats that can then be read by client applications, the former using [http://sourceforge.net/projects/taxonx/ TaxonX-XML] and the latter using the taXMLit format. The [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]] is also making significant progress in its aim to digitize substantial portions of the out-of-copyright taxonomic literature, which is then subjected to [[optical character recognition|OCR]] (optical character recognition) so as to be amenable to further processing using Biodiversity Informatics tools.

== Standards and protocols ==

In common with other data-related disciplines, Biodiversity Informatics benefits from the adoption of appropriate [[technical standard|standard]]s and [[protocol (computing)|protocols]] in order to support machine-machine transmission and interoperability of information within its particular domain. Examples of relevant standards include the [[Darwin Core]] [[XML]] [[XML schema|schema]] for specimen- and observation-based biodiversity data developed from 1998 onwards, plus extensions of the same, [http://www.tdwg.org/standards/117/ Taxonomic Concept Transfer Schema], plus standards for [http://www.tdwg.org/standards/116/ Structured Descriptive Data] and [http://www.tdwg.org/standards/115/ Access to Biological Collection Data] (ABCD); while data retrieval and transfer protocols include [http://digir.sourceforge.net/ DiGIR] (now mostly superseded) and [http://www.tdwg.org/standards/449/ TAPIR] (TDWG Access Protocol for Information Retrieval). Many of these standards and protocols are currently maintained, and their development overseen, by the [[TDWG|Taxonomic Databases Working Group]] (TDWG).

== Current activities ==

At the 2009 e-Biosphere conference in the U.K.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-biosphere09.org/&lt;/ref&gt; the following themes were adopted, which is indicative of a broad range of current Biodiversity Informatics activities and how they might be categorized:

* Application: Conservation / Agriculture / Fisheries / Industry / Forestry
* Application: Invasive Alien Species
* Application: Systematic and Evolutionary Biology
* Application: Taxonomy and Identification Systems
* New Tools, Services and Standards for Data Management and Access
** New Modeling Tools
** New Tools for Data Integration
** New Approaches to Biodiversity Infrastructure
** New Approaches to Species Identification
** New Approaches to Mapping Biodiversity
* National and Regional Biodiversity Databases and Networks

A post-conference workshop of key persons with current significant Biodiversity Informatics roles also resulted in a [https://web.archive.org/web/20120226041400/http://www.e-biosphere09.org/assets/files/workshop/Resolution.pdf Workshop Resolution] that stressed, among other aspects, the need to create durable, global registries for the resources that are basic to biodiversity informatics (e.g., repositories, collections); complete the construction of a solid taxonomic infrastructure; and create ontologies for biodiversity data.

'''Black &amp; Lane's Ident Tones for Surround''' ('''BLITS''') is a way of keeping track of channels in a mixed [[Surround sound|surround-sound]], [[stereo]], and [[Monaural|mono]] world. It was developed by Martin Black and Keith Lane of Sky TV London in 2004. BLITS is used by Sky, the BBC and other European and US broadcasters to identify and lineup 5.1 broadcast circuits. It is also an [[EBU]] standard: [https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3304.pdf EBU Tech 3304].&lt;ref name="ebu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Multichannel Audio Line-up Tones|url=http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3304.pdf|accessdate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed to function as a 5.1 identification and phase-checking signal and to be meaningful in stereo when an automated downmix to stereo is employed.

BLITS is a set of tones designed for television 5.1 sound line-up.
It consists of three distinct sections.

The first section is made up from short tones at -18 dBfs to identify each
channel individually:

Ø L/R: Front LEFT and Front RIGHT - 880&amp;nbsp;Hz

Ø C: CENTRE - 1320&amp;nbsp;Hz

Ø Lfe: (Low Frequency Effects) - 82.5&amp;nbsp;Hz

Ø Ls/Rs: Surround LEFT and Surround RIGHT - 660&amp;nbsp;Hz.

The second section identifies front left and right channels (L/R) only:

1&amp;nbsp;kHz tone at -18 dBfs is interrupted four times on the left channel and is continuous on the right. This pattern of interrupts has been chosen to prevent confusion with either the EBU stereo ident or BBC GLITS tone after stereo mix down.

The last section consists of 2&amp;nbsp;kHz tone at -24dBFS on all six channels. This can be used to check phase between any of the 5.1 legs.

When the tone is summed to stereo using default down-mix values this section should produce tones of approximately -18 dBfs on each channel.
The BLITS sequence repeats approximately every 14 seconds.

A zipped .wav file (interleaved multichannel format) of the [http://dpp-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/DPPLineUpTones.zip BLITS] 5.1 ident sequence is available from Sky.

The '''Centre for Studies on Federalism''' (CSF) was established in November 2000 with the primary purpose of studying and researching the theory and practice of [[Federalism]] both as a  political doctrine and in its implementation in the institutional systems of the Modern [[State (polity)|state]]. CSF’s main focus is on the infra-national, macro-regional and global scale of federalism: it specifically considers [[regional integration]] at a time of [[globalisation]], with special reference to [[Europe]], its history and civilization, its progress towards unification and its future.

== Structure and mission ==

CSF is housed at the [[Collegio Carlo Alberto]] in [[Turin]]. It was established as a research centre jointly with the [[University of Pavia]] and [[University of Turin]], with the Foundation Compagnia di San Paolo, and was subsequently joined by the [[University of Milan]].  
The purpose of CSF – as stated in its Statute of Association is to promote and coordinate scientific research on studies on federalism, as well promoting and coordinating activities with member universities and other Italian and foreign international universities and research centres. Furthermore, CSF also cooperates with private and public agencies and bodies interested in promoting fostering the development of knowledge and implementation of federalist principles.  
The CSF is governed by a Board which sets the guidelines for the scientific projects and fund allocation, the Steering Committee, the Board of Auditors and by a Scientific Committee whose members are renowned international scholars and experts of federalism. The administrative and scientific staff also include researchers from several universities and fields of research, including Law, Economics, Social, Political Science and History. Lastly, CSF’s Library contains some 12,000 books volumes, subscribes to 70 newspapers, journals and magazines. It also houses 500 ones titles that are no longer in print as well as a number of special collections bequeathed to the Centre, such as the CIME Archive of  the Italian Council of the [[European Movement]] and the online document summary of the [[Altiero Spinelli]] Collection, of which the  hard copies are at Historical Archives of the [[European Union]] administered by the European University Institute in [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eui.eu/Home.aspx# |title=European University Institute |access-date=2010-05-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511220935/http://www.eui.eu/Home.aspx# |archive-date=2010-05-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

Research at the  CSF is aimed at furthering the development of knowledge on the various aspects of Federalism, promoting debate in the public arena by studying and researching the public arena through studies and research on the above and to encourage researchers and experts to contribute to the discussion on European and international issues. 
Our Research Papers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/research/research-programmes  Research Papers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627001953/http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/research/research-programmes |date=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are addressed to Academia but also cover the facets and issues of interest for diplomats, politicians and several other professional arenas. 
Furthermore, CSF activity includes a number of editorial projects, in-depth studies, monitoring and surveying of global trends related to processes of federation, regional integration and international [[democracy]]. These include:

*	'''Perspectives on Federalism''': an online journal with a forum on federalism in all tiers of government – regional and global sub-national authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.on-federalism.eu/index.php  Perspectives on Federalism]&lt;/ref&gt;
*	'''Bibliographical Bulletin on Federalism''': an online quarterly offering providing an overview of articles on  Federalism from 700 Italian, English, French, German and Spanish journals and papers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalism-bulletin.eu  Bulletin on Federalism]&lt;/ref&gt;
*	'''International Democracy Watch''': a portal whose purpose is to collect, compare and analyse a set of data to monitor  progress and developments of democracy, international institutions and agencies, assessing such changes through regular  monitoring;
*	Operations within the framework of the '''Common Security and Defence Policy''' (EU CSDP Operations): these projects are aimed at gathering information for a comparative analysis of military, policing and state operations within the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/projects/eu-csdp-operations  EU CSDP Operations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627001828/http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/projects/eu-csdp-operations |date=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*	The '''Fiscal Federalism Watch''' to gain a better understanding of the reorganization of the Italian public finance system in Italy and what the consequences of a constitutional reform needed for fiscal federalism would be&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/projects/fiscal-federalism-watch  Fiscal Federalism Watch] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627001833/http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/projects/fiscal-federalism-watch |date=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events and activities ==

CSF organises meetings and seminars jointly with other institutions and research bodies &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/resourches-and-links  CSF Partners] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627002013/http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/resourches-and-links |date=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; devoted to a more comprehensive understanding of certain topics or to the presentation of books some of which published by CSF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/publications/studies-series  CSF "Studies" Series] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627001943/http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/publications/studies-series |date=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Altiero Spinelli Lecture is the CSF’s most important academic event: a yearly conference with a keynote lecture (lectio magistralis) held by an internationally renowned expert or academic on a European or Federalist topic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/projects/lecture-altiero-spinelli  Lecture Altiero Spinelli] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627001900/http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/projects/lecture-altiero-spinelli |date=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of naming the lecture after Altiero Spinelli, one of the founding fathers of European Federalism, came from the need for an ad hoc conference to study [[European integration]] more in depth. CSF also offers and Education programme, with post graduate courses in Law and Business,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/activities/training  L&amp;B] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627001711/http://www.csfederalismo.it/index.php/en/activities/training |date=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; organised with the Turin University Institute of European Studies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iuse.it/en/  IUSE]&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at offering advanced studies on law and economics with a special focus on to the internal EU market.

In 1965 the Seminar on '''Comprehensive Musicianship''' was held at [[Northwestern University]]. Its purpose was to develop and implement means of improving the education of music teachers. In 1967 a symposium was held at Airlie House (a conference center) in [[Warrenton, Virginia]] to discuss means of evaluating comprehensive musicianship. The resultant document, ''Procedures for Evaluation of Music in Contemporary Education'', offers guidelines for the evaluation of techniques and attitudes acquired through comprehensive musicianship studies.

There are two curricula that are examples of the Comprehensive Musicianship methodology: The Manhattanville Music Curriculum Program and the Hawaii Music Curriculum Program.

==Manhattanville Music Curriculum Program==
{{Main|MMCP – Manhattanville Music Curriculum Project}}
The Manhattanville Music Curriculum Program (MMCP) was funded by a grant from the [[U.S. Dept. of Education]] and was named for [[Manhattanville College]] in [[Purchase, New York]]. Its objectives were to develop a music curriculum and related materials for a sequential music learning program for the primary grades through high school. The project produced the ''Synthesis'', a comprehensive curriculum for grades 3 through 12, ''Interaction'', an early childhood curriculum, and three feasibility studies: The Electronic Keyboard Laboratory, the Science-Music Program, and the Instrumental Program.

MMCP began in 1965 with an exploratory of 92 innovative and experimental music programs. Phase One (1966) dealt with perspectives of student learning potentials, problems of curriculum reform, and classroom procedures. Phase Two (1967) dealt with the refinement and synthesis of information gained in the first exploratory period and the organization of information into a feasible curriculum. Phase Three (1968) consisted of the refinement and field testing of all curriculum items, the initial investigation of a separate curriculum for early childhood, the preparation and testing of plans for teacher retraining, and the development of an assessment instrument that reflected the program objectives.

==Hawaii Music Curriculum Program==

The Hawaii Music Curriculum Program began in 1968 under the sponsorship of the Hawaii Curriculum Center in Honolulu. Its purpose was to create a logical, continuous educational program ensuring the competent guidance of the music education of all children in the state's public schools and to test and assemble the materials needed by schools to realize this program. Students are to be involved with music in school in the same ways that people are involved with music in the outside world. The curriculum is based on seven basic concepts: tone, rhythm, melody, harmony, form, tonality, and texture, that are presented in the form of a spiral curriculum. The taxonomy of concepts was translated into a curriculum by means of division into five "zones."{{clarify|date=October 2013}}

'''Computational law''' is a branch of [[legal informatics]] concerned with the [[mechanization]] of legal reasoning (whether done by humans or by computers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://complaw.stanford.edu/|title=Computational Law - The Cop in the Backseat|first=Michael|last=Genesereth|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It emphasizes explicit behavioral constraints and eschews implicit rules of conduct.  Importantly, there is a commitment to a level of rigor in specifying laws that is sufficient to support entirely mechanical processing.

Philosophically, computational law sits within the [[legal formalism|Legal Formalist]] school of [[jurisprudence]].  Given its emphasis on rigorously specified laws, computational law is most applicable in [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] settings, where laws are taken more or less literally.  It is less applicable to legal systems based on [[common law]], which provides more scope for unspecified normative considerations.  However, even in common law systems, computational law still has relevance in the case of categorical statutes and in settings where the handling of cases has resulted in [[de facto]] rules.

From a pragmatic perspective, computational law is important as the basis for computer systems capable of doing useful legal calculations, such as compliance checking, legal planning, regulatory analysis, and so forth.  Some systems of this sort already exist.&lt;ref&gt;Lawbots.info. N.p., n.d. Web. 16 June 2017. &lt;https://www.lawbots.info/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[TurboTax]] is a good example.  And the potential is particularly significant now due to recent technological advances – including the prevalence of the [[Internet]] in human interaction and the proliferation of [[embedded computer system]]s (such as [[smart phones]], [[self-driving cars]], and [[robot]]s).

== History ==
Speculation about potential benefits to legal practice through applying methods from computational science and AI research to automate parts of the law date back at least to the middle 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;18 Rocky Mntn. L. Rev. 378 (1945-1946) Does the Law Need a Technological Revolution; Kelso, Louis O.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, [[Artificial intelligence and law|AI and law]] and computational law do not seem easily separable, as perhaps most of AI research focusing on the law and its automation appears to utilize computational methods. The forms that speculation took are multiple and not all related in ways to readily show closeness to one another. This history will sketch them as they were, attempting to show relationships where they can be found to have existed.

By 1949, a minor [[academic field]] aiming to incorporate [[Data storage|electronic]] and [[computational]] methods to legal problems had been founded by American legal scholars, called [[jurimetrics]].&lt;ref&gt;33 Minn. L. Rev. 455 (1948-1949) Jurimetrics--The Next Step Forward; Loevinger, Lee&lt;/ref&gt; Though broadly said to be concerned with the application of the "methods of science" to the law, these methods were actually of a quite specifically defined scope. Jurimetrics was to be "concerned with such matters as the quantitative analysis of judicial behavior, the application of communication and information theory to legal expression, the use of mathematical logic in law, the retrieval of legal data by electronic and mechanical means, and the formulation of a calculus of legal predictability".&lt;ref&gt;Loevinger, Lee. "Jurimetrics: The methodology of legal inquiry." ''Law and Contemporary Problems'' (1963): 5-35. At 8.&lt;/ref&gt; These interests led in 1959 to the founding a journal, ''Modern Uses of Logic in Law'', as a forum wherein articles would be published about the applications of techniques such as mathematical logic, engineering, statistics, etc. to the legal study and development.&lt;ref&gt;"About Jurimetrics." ''About the Journal''. American Bar Association Section of Science &amp; Technology Law and the Center for Law, Science &amp; Innovation, n.d. Web. 26 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://www.law.asu.edu/jurimetrics/JurimetricsJournal/AbouttheJournal.aspx&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, this Journal was renamed as ''[[Jurimetrics (journal)|Jurimetrics]].''&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid,''&lt;/ref&gt;'' ''Today, however, the journal and meaning of jurimetrics seems to have broadened far beyond what would fit under the areas of applications of computers and computational methods to law. Today the journal not only publishes articles on such practices as found in computational law, but has broadened jurimetrical concerns to mean also things like the use of social science in law or the "policy implications [of] and legislative and administrative control of science".&lt;ref name="ibid."&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Independently in 1958, at the Conference for the Mechanization of Thought held at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] in [[Teddington]], Middlesex, UK, the French jurist Lucien Mehl presented a paper both on the benefits of using computational methods for law and on the potential means to use such methods to automate law for a discussion that included AI luminaries like [[Marvin Minsky]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mechanization of Thought Processes: Proceedings of a Symposium Held at the National Physical Laboratory on 24th, 25th, 26th and 27th November 1958''. London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1959. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niblett, Bryan. ''Computer Science and the Law: Inaugural Lecture of the Professor of Computer Science Delivered at the College on January 25, 1977''. Swansea, Wales: U College of Swansea, 1977. 7-8. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Mehl believed that the law could by automated by two basic distinct, though not wholly separable, types of machine. These were the "documentary or information machine", which would provide the legal researcher quick access to relevant case precedents and legal scholarship,&lt;ref&gt;"Automation in the Legal World." ''Mechanization of Thought Processes: Proceedings of a Symposium Held at the National Physical Laboratory on 24th, 25th, 26th and 27th November 1958''.

By 1970, Mehl's first type of machine, one that would be able to retrieve information, had been accomplished but there seems to have been little consideration of further fruitful intersections between AI and legal research.&lt;ref&gt;Some Speculation about Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning

&lt;/ref&gt;  There were, however, still hopes that computers could model the lawyer's thought processes through computational methods and then apply that capacity to solve legal problems, thus automating and improving legal services via increased efficiency as well as shedding light on the nature of legal reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Some Speculation about Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning

Bruce G. Buchanan and Thomas E. Headrick

''Stanford Law Review'',Vol. 23, No. 1 (Nov., 1970), pp. 40-62. At p. 51-60.
&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1970s, computer science and the affordability of computer technology had progressed enough that the retrieval of "legal data by electronic and mechanical means" had been achieved by machines fitting Mehl's first type and were in common use in American law firms.&lt;ref&gt;Legal Decisions and Information Systems. Jon Bing and Trygve Harvold. Oslo, Norway: Universitets Forlaget; 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niblett, Bryan. ''Computer Science and Law''. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1980. 7-8. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, research focused on improving the goals of the early 1970s occurred, with programs like ''Taxman'' being worked on in order to both bring useful computer technology into the law as practical aids and to help specify the exact nature of legal concepts.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., L. Thorne McCarty, ''Reflections on Taxman: An Experiment in Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning, ''90 Harv. L. Rev. 837-895 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, progress on the second type of machine, one that would more fully automate the law, remained relatively inert.&lt;ref&gt;''Supra'', Niblett, p. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Research into machines that could answer questions in the way that Mehl's consultation machine would picked up somewhat in the late 1970s and 1980s. A 1979 convention in [[Swansea]], Wales marked the first international effort solely to focus upon applying artificial intelligence research to legal problems in order to "consider how computers can be used to discover and apply the legal norms embedded within the written sources of the law".&lt;ref&gt;B. Niblett, editor. Computer Science and Law: An Advanced Course. Cambridge University Press, 1980. This volume is a record of the proceedings of a workshop held at University College of Swansea, Wales, September 17–27, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCarty, L. Thorne. "Artificial Intelligence and Law: How to get there from here." ''Ratio Juris'' 3.2 (1990): 189-200. At 189.&lt;/ref&gt; That said, little substantial progress seems to have been made in the following decade of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Though this is contestable. For an argument supporting, see McCarty, L. Thorne. "Artificial Intelligence and Law: How to get there from here." ''Ratio Juris'' 3.2 (1990): 189-200.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1988 review of Anne Gardner's book ''An Artificial Intelligence Approach to Legal Reasoning ''(1987), the Harvard academic legal scholar and computer scientist Edwina Rissland wrote that "She plays, in part, the role of pioneer; [[artificial intelligence]] ("AI") techniques have not yet been widely applied to perform legal tasks. Therefore, Gardner, and this review, first describe and define the field, then demonstrate a working model in the domain of contract offer and acceptance."&lt;ref&gt;Rissland, Edwina. "Artificial Intelligence and Legal Reasoning: A Discussion of the Field and Gardner's Book." ''AI Magazine'' 9.3 (1988): 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight years after the Swansea conference had passed, and still AI and law researchers merely trying to delineate the field could be described by their own kind as "pioneer[s]".

In the 1990s and early 2000s more progress occurred. Computational research generated insights for law.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Kades, Eric, "The Laws of Complexity &amp; the Complexity of Laws: The Implications of Computational Complexity Theory for the Law" 49 Rutgers Law Review 403-484 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The First International Conference on AI and the Law occurred it 1987, but it is in the 1990s and 2000s that the biannual conference began to build up steam and to delve more deeply into the issues involved with work intersecting computational methods, AI, and law.&lt;ref&gt;Rissland, E. L., Ashley, K. D., &amp; Loui, R. P. (2003). AI and Law: A fruitful synergy.

The citation includes all past conferences and links to their contents. It appears that during the 1990s the number of papers presented, talks given, etc. increased significantly from the first two conferences held respectively in 1987 and 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Classes began to be taught to undergraduates on the uses of computational methods to automating, understanding, and obeying the law.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., this syllabus from Stanford for CS 204 Computers and Law.

Web. 23 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://logic.stanford.edu/classes/cs204/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, by 2005, a team largely composed of Stanford computer scientists from the Stanford Logic group had devoted themselves to studying the uses of computational techniques to the law.&lt;ref&gt;"Stanford Computational Law." ''Stanford Computational Law''. Stanford University, n.d. Web. 24 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://complaw.stanford.edu/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Computational methods in fact advanced enough that members of the legal profession began in the 2000s to both analyze, predict and worry about the potential future of computational law and a new academic field of computational legal studies seems to be now well established. As insight into what such scholars see in the law's future due in part to computational law, here is quote from a recent conference about the "New Normal" for the legal profession:

:"Over the last 5 years, in the fallout of the Great Recession, the legal profession has entered the era of the New Normal. Notably, a series of forces related to technological change, globalization, and the pressure to do more with less (in both corporate America and law firms) has changed permanently the legal services industry. As '''one article''' put it, firms are cutting back on hiring "in order to increase efficiency, improve profit margins, and reduce client costs." Indeed, in its recently noted cutbacks, Weil Gotshal's '''leaders remarked''' that it had initially expected old work to return, but came "around to the view that this is the ‘new normal.’"The New Normal provides lawyers with an opportunity to rethink—and reimagine—the role of lawyers in our economy and society. To the extent that law firms enjoyed, or still enjoy, the ability to bundle work together, that era is coming to an end, as clients unbundle legal services and tasks. Moreover, in other cases, automation and technology can change the roles of lawyers, both requiring them to oversee processes and use technology more aggressively as well as doing less of the work that is increasingly managed by computers (think: electronic discovery). The upside is not only greater efficiencies for society, but new possibilities for legal craftsmanship. The emerging craft of lawyering in the New Normal is likely to require lawyers to be both entrepreneurial and fluent with a range of competencies that will enable them to add value for clients. Apropos of the trends noted above, there are emerging opportunities for "legal entrepreneurs" in a range of roles from legal process management to developing technologies to manage legal operations (such as overseeing automated processes) to supporting online dispute resolution processes. In other cases, effective legal training as well as domain specific knowledge (finance, sales, IT, entrepreneurship, human resources, etc.) can form a powerful combination that prepares law school grads for a range of opportunities (business development roles, financial operations roles, HR roles, etc.). In both cases, traditional legal skills alone will not be enough to prepare law students for these roles. But the proper training, which builds on the traditional law school curriculum and goes well beyond it including practical skills, relevant domain knowledge (e.g., accounting), and professional skills (e.g., working in teams), will provide law school students a huge advantage over those with a one-dimensional skill set."''&lt;ref&gt;"The Future of Law School Innovation (Conference @ColoradoLaw)."Computational Legal Studies''. N.p., n.d. Web. 18 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://computationallegalstudies.com/2014/04/17/the-future-of-law-school-innovation-conference-coloradolaw/&gt;.''&lt;/ref&gt;''
Many see perks to oncoming changes brought about by the computational automation of law. For one thing, legal experts have predicted that it will aid legal self-help, especially in the areas of contract formation, enterprise planning, and the prediction of rule changes.&lt;ref name="ibid."/&gt; For another thing, those with knowledge about computers see the potential for computational law to really fully bloom as eminent. In this vein, it seems that machines like Mehl's second type may come into existence. [[Stephen Wolfram]] has said that:

:"So we're slowly moving toward people being educated in the kind of computational paradigm. Which is good, because the way I see it, computation is going to become central to almost every field. Let's talk about two examples—classic professions: law and medicine. It's funny, when Leibniz was first thinking about computation at the end of the 1600s, the thing he wanted to do was to build a machine that would effectively answer legal questions. It was too early then. But now we’re almost ready, I think, for computational law. Where for example contracts become computational. They explicitly become algorithms that decide what's possible and what's not.You know, some pieces of this have already happened. Like with financial derivatives, like options and futures. In the past these used to just be natural language contracts. But then they got codified and parametrized. So they’re really just algorithms, which of course one can do meta-computations on, which is what has launched a thousand hedge funds, and so on. Well, eventually one's going to be able to make computational all sorts of legal things, from mortgages to tax codes to perhaps even patents. Now to actually achieve that, one has to have ways to represent many aspects of the real world, in all its messiness. Which is what the whole knowledge-based computing of Wolfram|Alpha is about."&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Stephen. "Talking about the Computational Future at SXSW 2013—Stephen Wolfram Blog." ''Stephen Wolfram Blog RSS''. N.p., 19 Mar. 2013. Web. 17 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2013/03/talking-about-the-computational-future-at-sxsw-2013/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches ==

=== Algorithmic law ===
There have also been many attempts to create a [[Machine-readable data|machine readable]] or machine executable [[legal code]]. A machine readable code would simplify the analysis of legal code, allowing the rapid construction and analysis of databases, without the need for advanced text processing techniques. A machine executable format would allow the specifics of a case to be input, and would return the decision based on the case.

Machine readable legal code is already quite common.  METAlex,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalex.eu/]&lt;/ref&gt; an [[XML]]-based standard proposed and developed by the [[Leibniz Center for Law]] of the [[University of Amsterdam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dare.uva.nl/record/1/425496|title=University of Amsterdam Digital Academic Repository}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used by the governments of both the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to encode their laws. In the United States, an executive order issued by President [[Barack Obama]] in the May 2013 mandated that all public government documentation be released in a machine readable format by default, although no specific format was mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;The White House. Office of the Press Secretary. ''Executive Order -- Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information''. N.p., 9 May 2013. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Machine executable legal code is much less common. Notable among current efforts is the Hammurabi Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/mpoulshock/HammurabiProject|title=The Hammurabi Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an attempt to rewrite parts of the United States legal code in such a way that a law can take facts as input and return decisions. The Hammurabi Project currently focuses on the aspects of law that lend themselves to this type of specification, such as [[tax law|tax]] or [[immigration law]]s, although in the long-term the developers of the Hammurabi Project plan to include as many laws as possible.

=== Empirical analysis ===
Many current efforts in computational law are focused on the empirical analysis of legal decisions, and their relation to legislation.  These efforts usually make use of [[citation analysis]], which examines patterns in citations between works. Due to the widespread practice of [[legal citation]], it is possible to construct [[citation indices]] and large [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] of legal precedent, called citation networks. Citation networks allow the use of [[graph traversal]] algorithms in order to relate cases to one another, as well as the use of various distance metrics to find mathematical relationships between them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Fowler, J. H., T. R. Johnson, J. F. Spriggs, S. Jeon, and P. J. Wahlbeck. "Network Analysis and the Law: Measuring the Legal Importance of Precedents at the U.S. Supreme Court." ''Political Analysis'' 15.3 (2006): 324-46. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bommarito, Michael J., and Daniel M. Katz. "A Mathematical Approach to the Study of the United States Code." ''Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications'' 389.19 (2010): 4195-200. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bommarito, Michael J., Daniel Martin Katz, Jonathan L. Zelner, and James H. Fowler. "Distance Measures for Dynamic Citation Networks." ''Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications'' 389.19 (2010): 4201-208. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These analyses can reveal important overarching patterns and trends in judicial proceedings and the way law is used.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

There have been several breakthroughs in the analysis of judicial rulings in recent research on legal citation networks. These analyses have made use of citations in Supreme Court majority opinions to build citation networks, and analyzed the patterns in these networks to identify meta-information about individual decisions, such as the importance of the decision, as well as general trends in judicial proceedings, such as the role of [[precedent]] over time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Fowler, James H., and Sangick Jeon. "The Authority of Supreme Court Precedent." ''Social Networks'' 30.1 (2008): 16-30. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These analyses have been used to predict which cases the Supreme Court will choose to consider.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Another effort has examined [[United States Tax Court]] decisions, compiling a publicly available database of Tax Court decisions, opinions, and citations between the years of 1990 and 2008, and constructing a citation network from this database. Analysis of this network revealed that large sections of the tax code were rarely, if ever, cited, and that other sections of code, such as those that dealt with "divorce, dependents, nonprofits, hobby and business expenses and losses, and general definition of income," were involved the vast majority of disputes.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Bommarito, Michael J. "Empirical Survey of the Population of US Tax Court Written Decisions, An." ''Va. Tax Rev.'' 30 (2010): 523.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research has also been focused on [[hierarchical networks]], in combination with citation networks, and the analysis of [[United States Code]]. This research has been used to analyze various aspects of the Code, including its size, the density of citations within and between sections of the Code, the type of language used in the Code, and how these features vary over time. This research has been used to provide commentary on the nature of the Code's change over time, which is characterized by an increase in size and in interdependence between sections.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Visualization ===
Visualization of legal code, and of the relationships between various laws and decisions, is also a hot topic in computational law. Visualizations allow both professionals and laypeople to see large-scale relationships and patterns, which may be difficult to see using standard legal analysis or empirical analysis.

Legal citation networks lend themselves to visualization, and many citation networks which are analyzed empirically also have sub-sections of the network that are represented visually as a result.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, there are still many technical problems in [[network visualization]]. The density of connections between nodes, and the sheer number of nodes in some cases, can make the visualization incomprehensible to humans. There are a variety of methods that can be used to reduce the complexity of the displayed information, for example by defining semantic sub-groups within the network, and then representing relationships between these semantic groups, rather than between every node.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Shneiderman, Ben, and Aleks Aris. "Network Visualization by Semantic Substrates." ''IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics'' 12.5 (2006): 733-40. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the visualization to be human readable, but the reduction in complexity can obscure relationships. Despite this limitation, visualization of legal citation networks remains a popular field and practice.

[[Image:utah teapot simple 2.png|thumb|A modern rendering of the [[Utah teapot]], an iconic model in 3D computer graphics created by [[Martin Newell (computer scientist)|Martin Newell]] in 1975.]]

'''Computer graphics''' is a sub-field of [[Computer Science]] which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content.  Although the term often refers to the study of [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional computer graphics]], it also encompasses [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional graphics]] and [[image processing]].

== Overview ==
Computer graphics studies the manipulation of visual and geometric information using computational techniques.  It focuses on the ''mathematical'' and ''computational'' foundations of image generation and processing rather than purely [[aesthetic]] issues.  Computer graphics is often differentiated from the field of [[visualization (graphic)|visualization]], although the two fields have many similarities.

Connected studies include:
* [[Applied mathematics]]
* [[Computational geometry]]
* [[Computational topology]]
* [[Computer vision]]
* [[Image processing]]
* [[Information visualization]]
* [[Scientific visualization]]

Applications of computer graphics include:
*[[Print design]]
*[[Digital art]]
*[[Special effect]]s
*[[Video game]]s
*[[Visual effects]]

== History ==
{{see also|History of computer animation}}
One of the first displays of computer animation was ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), which included an [[animation]] of a human face and hand&amp;mdash;produced by [[Edwin Catmull|Ed Catmull]] and [[Fred Parke]] at the [[University of Utah]]. Swedish inventor [[Håkan Lans]] applied for the first patent on color graphics in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent

There are several international conferences and journals where the most significant results in computer graphics are published. Among them are the [[SIGGRAPH]] and [[Eurographics]] conferences and the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) Transactions on Graphics journal. The joint Eurographics and [[ACM SIGGRAPH]] symposium series features the major venues for the more specialized sub-fields: Symposium on Geometry Processing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geometryprocessing.org |title=geometryprocessing.org |publisher=geometryprocessing.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symposium on Rendering, and Symposium on Computer Animation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eg.org/events ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314004027/http://www.eg.org/events |date=March 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in the rest of computer science, conference publications in computer graphics are generally more significant than journal publications (and subsequently have lower acceptance rates).&lt;ref name="cra memo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cra.org/reports/tenure_review.html |title=Best Practices Memo |publisher=Cra.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ernst note"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.csail.mit.edu/mernst/advice/conferences-vs-journals.html |title=Choosing a venue: conference or journal? |publisher=People.csail.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="graphics acceptance rates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vrlab.epfl.ch/~ulicny/statistics/ |title=Graphics/vision publications acceptance rates statistics |publisher=Vrlab.epfl.ch |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An extensive history of computer graphics can be found at [http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/lessons.html this page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405172134/http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/lessons.html |date=April 5, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subfields ==
A broad classification of major subfields in computer graphics might be:

# [[Geometry]]: studies ways to represent and process surfaces
# [[Animation]]: studies ways to represent and manipulate motion
# [[Rendering (computer graphics)|Rendering]]: studies [[algorithm]]s to reproduce light transport
# [[Digital imaging|Imaging]]: studies image acquisition or image editing
# [[Topology]]: studies the behaviour of spaces and surfaces.

=== Geometry ===
[[Image:Stanford bunny qem.png|thumb|Successive approximations of a surface computed using quadric error metrics.]]

The subfield of geometry studies the representation of three-dimensional objects in a discrete digital setting.  Because the appearance of an object depends largely on its exterior, [[boundary representation]]s are most commonly used.  Two dimensional [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s are a good representation for most objects, though they may be non-[[manifold]].  Since surfaces are not finite, discrete digital approximations are used. [[polygon mesh|Polygonal meshes]] (and to a lesser extent [[subdivision surfaces]]) are by far the most common representation, although point-based representations have become more popular recently (see for instance the Symposium on Point-Based Graphics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphics.ethz.ch/events/pbg/07/ |title=Point Based Graphics 2007 - PBG07 |publisher=Graphics.ethz.ch |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; These representations are ''Lagrangian,'' meaning the spatial locations of the samples are independent.  Recently, ''Eulerian'' surface descriptions (i.e., where spatial samples are fixed) such as [[level set]]s have been developed into a useful representation for deforming surfaces which undergo many topological changes (with [[fluids]] being the most notable example).&lt;ref name="stanford fedkiw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphics.stanford.edu/~fedkiw/ |title=Ron Fedkiw |publisher=Graphics.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Point-based graphics – a recent field which focuses on points as the fundamental representation of surfaces.
* [[Subdivision surfaces]]
* Out-of-core mesh processing – another recent field which focuses on mesh datasets that do not fit in main memory.

=== Animation ===
The subfield of animation studies descriptions for surfaces (and other phenomena) that move or deform over time.  Historically, most work in this field has focused on parametric and data-driven models, but recently [[physical simulation]] has become more popular as computers have become more powerful computationally.

;Subfields
* Performance capture
* Character animation
* Physical simulation (e.g. [[cloth modeling]],  animation of [[fluid dynamics]], etc.)

=== Rendering ===
[[Image:Cornellbox pathtracing irradiancecaching.png|thumb|Indirect diffuse scattering simulated using [[path tracing]] and [[irradiance caching]].]]

Rendering generates images from a model.  Rendering may simulate [[light transport theory|light transport]] to create realistic images or it may create images that have a particular artistic style in [[non-photorealistic rendering]].  The two basic operations in realistic rendering are transport (how much light passes from one place to another) and scattering (how surfaces interact with light).  See [[Rendering (computer graphics)]] for more information.

;Transport
[[light transport theory|Transport]] describes how illumination in a scene gets from one place to another. [[visibility (geometry)|Visibility]] is a major component of light transport.

;Scattering
Models of ''scattering'' and ''shading'' are used to describe the appearance of a surface.  In graphics these problems are often studied within the context of rendering since they can substantially affect the design of [[rendering algorithm]]s.  Shading can be broken down into two orthogonal issues, which are often studied independently:

# '''scattering''' – how light interacts with the surface ''at a given point''
# '''shading''' – how material properties vary across the surface

The former problem refers to [[scattering]], i.e., the relationship between incoming and outgoing illumination at a given point.  Descriptions of scattering are usually given in terms of a [[bidirectional scattering distribution function]] or BSDF.  The latter issue addresses how different types of scattering are distributed across the surface (i.e., which scattering function applies where).  Descriptions of this kind are typically expressed with a program called a [[shader]].  (Note that there is some confusion since the word "shader" is sometimes used for programs that describe local ''geometric'' variation.)

;Other subfields
* physically based rendering – concerned with generating images according to the laws of [[geometric optics]]
* [[Real-time rendering|real time rendering]] – focuses on rendering for interactive applications, typically using specialized hardware like [[graphics processing unit|GPUs]]
* [[non-photorealistic rendering]]
* relighting – recent area concerned with quickly re-rendering scenes

'''Crowdreviewing''' is the practice of gathering opinion or feedback from a large number of people, typically via the internet or an online community; a [[portmanteau]] of “crowd” and “reviews”. Crowdreviewing is also often viewed as a form of crowd voting which occurs when a website gathers a large group's opinions and judgment.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite news|title=IEM Demonstrates the Political Wisdom of Crowds |first=John |last=Robson |url=http://tippie.uiowa.edu/iem/media/story.cfm?id=2793 |newspaper=Canoe.ca |date=February 24, 2012 |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is based on the principles of  [[crowdsourcing]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and lets users submit online reviews to participate in building online metrics that measure performance. By harnessing social collaboration in the form of feedback individuals are generally able to form a more informed opinion.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Crowdreviews: Today’s Word of Mouth - Search Marketing Standard Magazine {{!}} Covering Search Engines|url = http://www.searchmarketingstandard.com/crowdreviews-todays-word-mouth|website = www.searchmarketingstandard.com|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Crowdreviews |url = http://www.crowdreviews.com/frequently-asked-questions#what-is-crowdreviewing|website = www.crowdreviews.com|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Article - CrowdReviews.com takes lead as a top reputation tool - sourced from the crowd by visibility|publisher=Visibility Magazine|url = http://www.visibilitymagazine.com/crowdreviews-com-takes-lead-as-a-top-reputation-tool-sourced-from-the-crowd/|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Crowdsourced Performance Review: How to Use the Power of Social Recognition to Transform Employee Performance|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=F0qsK46nSA0C|publisher = McGraw Hill Professional|date = 2013-05-31|isbn = 9780071817998|first = Eric|last = Mosley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Information Systems and Technology for Organizational Agility, Intelligence, and Resilience|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lw6XBQAAQBAJ|publisher = IGI Global|date = 2014-04-30|isbn = 9781466659711|first = Rahman|last=Hakikur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of the crowd==
In crowdreviewing the crowd becomes the source of information used in determining the relative performance of products and services.&lt;ref name="Safire"&gt;{{cite news|last= Safire | first= William | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/08/magazine/08wwln-safire-t.html?_r=3&amp;ref=magazine&amp; | title= On Language | publisher= New York Times Magazine | date= February 5, 2009 | accessdate= May 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As crowdreviewing focuses on receiving input from a large number of parties, the resulting collaboration produces more credible feedback compared to the feedback left by a single party. The responsibility of identifying strengths and weaknesses falls to multiple individuals which each have had their own experience rather than on a single individual. Buyers will therefore be more likely to trust the feedback of a collective group of people rather than a single individual.&lt;ref name="estelles"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Estellés-Arolas | first1 = Enrique | last2 = González-Ladrón-de-Guevara | first2 = Fernando | title = Towards an Integrated Crowdsourcing Definition | journal = Journal of Information Science | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | year = 2012 | pages = 189–200 | url = http://www.crowdsourcing-blog.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Towards-an-integrated-crowdsourcing-definition-Estell%C3%A9s-Gonz%C3%A1lez.pdf| format=PDF | doi=10.1177/0165551512437638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = wired2007&gt;

== Common Parties ==
The crowd consists of a number of different parties which have various interests in regards to the outcome produced.&lt;ref name="Prpić, J 2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Prpić| first=J|author2=Shukla, P. |author3=Roth, Y. |author4=Lemoine, J.F. |year=2015 |chapter=A Geography of Participation in IT-Mediated Crowds |title=Proceedings of the Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences 2015.|ssrn=2494537|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential Customers ===
A potential customer of a product or service would have an interest in viewing information on how a particular product or service stands in terms of subjective or objective quality before making a purchasing decision. Potential customers may also be interested in leaving feedback on a particular product or service to explain why they didn’t make their purchase.&lt;ref name="kaufmann"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kaufmann | first1 = N. | last2 = Schulze | first2 =T. | last3 = Viet | first3 = D. | title = More than fun and money.

=== Customers ===
Customers of products and services are a primary party in the process of reviewing. Customers are closely connected to the process as they would have first-hand experience with a product and service. Their primary role would be detailing their experiences with the product or service. A customer’s interest in crowdreviewing would stem from an interest in showing their appreciation towards the quality of a product or service or in voicing their concerns or disappointment in a product or service.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Sellers ===
Sellers usually get their satisfied customers involved in leaving reviews for their products and services. A seller has an interest in having positive feedback on display as a means to influence potential buyers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bracken, D.W., Rose, D.S. (2011) "When does 360-degree Feedback create behavior change? And How would we know when it does?"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competitors ===
Competitors would have an interest in reviewing feedback from the crowd as a means of obtaining competitive intelligence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

There may be other audiences involved in the process such as employees, suppliers, partners, and other relevant parties.&lt;ref name="Britt"&gt;{{cite web |title = Crowdsourcing: The Debate Roars On |url= http://insite.artinstitutes.edu/crowdsourcing-the-debate-roars-on-39739.aspx | first= Darice|last= Britt | accessdate= 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits and risks ==
There are a number of benefits to the different parties which make up the crowd. Potential buyers are able to obtain information on products and services prior to making a purchase. Those which have already bought or used the product or service are able to post experiences both positive and negative in order to inform other potential buyers. As an additional benefit to the buyers, buyers may also post negative reviews in hopes of resolving their negative experiences with their seller. Sellers have the benefits of receiving positive feedback and also potentially resolving issues with dissatisfied customers. Competitors are able to learn more about what their competition is doing in order to improve their own products and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burnap|first1=Alex|last2=Ren|first2=Alex J.|last3=Papazoglou|first3=Giannis|last4=Gerth|first4=Richard|last5=Gonzalez|first5=Richard|last6=Papalambros|first6=Panos|title=When Crowdsourcing Fails: A Study of Expertise on Crowdsourced Design Evaluation|format=PDF |url= http://ode.engin.umich.edu/publications/PapalambrosPapers/2015/316J.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aitamurto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/963662/The_Promise_of_Idea_Crowdsourcing_Benefits_Contexts_Limitations |title=The Promise of Idea Crowdsourcing: Benefits, Contexts, Limitations &amp;#124; Tanja Aitamurto |publisher=Academia.edu |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ipeirotis2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ipeirotis |last2 = Provost |last3=Wang |year=2010 |title=Quality Management on Amazon Mechanical Turk |format=PDF |url= http://people.stern.nyu.edu/panos/publications/hcomp2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the benefits associated with crowdreviewing, there are a number of risks and challenges to overcome. For potential buyers there is always the risk that reviews may be sourced by the vendors themselves or other parties paid to leave a specific type of feedback on a product or service. Sellers have the possibility of receiving negative reviews which may in turn negatively influence their reputation and affect their bottom line revenue numbers. Competitors, while enjoying the benefit of being able to learn from their competitors are also subject to their competitors learning about their positives and negatives.&lt;ref name="aitamurto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;{{cite news |title = The Myth of Crowdsourcing |url= https://www.forbes.com/2009/09/28/crowdsourcing-enterprise-innovation-technology-cio-network-jargonspy.html | first= Dan |last=Woods | date=28 September 2009 | accessdate= 2012-12-04 | work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations and controversies ==

=== Size of the Crowd ===
One of the major factors influencing crowdreviewing is the size of the crowd involved. A crowdreviewing venture is positively influenced by having a large number of parties leave reviews and feedback on products and services. In cases where a small number of individuals leave their feedback, more weight is placed on an individual reviewer or opinion and could therefore be of minimal value to potential customers. A smaller sample of reviews may also exhibit bias towards or against the product or service.&lt;ref name="Borst"&gt;{{cite web |title = The Case For and Against Crowdsourcing: Part 2 |url= http://www.crowdsourcing.org/editorial/the-case-for-and-against-crowdsourcing-part-2/2850 | first= Irma |last= Borst | accessdate= 2015-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Industry Knowledge ===
A common limitation of allowing all parties to have an opportunity to review a product or service may involve having reviews written without a minimal or meaningful understanding of the product or service. A lack of industry or specialized knowledge may in turn minimize the value of a review or potentially inversely affect what would be considered a fair review.&lt;ref name="Borst" /&gt;

=== Seller Manipulation ===
With allowing multiple parties to review a product or service there is a possibility that a seller may attempt to manipulate reviews in a number of ways. Sellers may hire third parties or create fake identities in order to leave positive reviews on their product or service. They may also do the same to create negative reviews on competing products and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Ipeirotis |year=2010 |title= Analyzing the Amazon Mechanical Turk Marketplace |journal=XRDS: Crossroads, The ACM Magazine for Students |volume=17 |issue=2 |publisher = ACM |url=http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1870000/1869094/p16-ipeirotis.pdf?ip=128.237.228.168&amp;acc=OPEN&amp;CFID=67955182&amp;CFTOKEN=99801176&amp;__acm__=1330412802_d8ed25958879e894447fe2c38fb1cf1a |format=PDF| accessdate=February 26, 2012|doi=10.1145/1870000/1869094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Balance of Negative and Positive Reviews ===
Customers which have a negative experience with a product or service are more likely to offer a their review in an effort to resolve buyer’s remorse in comparison to those which have had a positive experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kurve|first1=Aditya|last2=Miller|first2=David J.|last3=Kesidis|first3=George|title=Multicategory Crowdsourcing Accounting for Variable Task Difficulty, Worker Skill, and Worker Intention|journal=IEEE KDE|date=30 May 2014|issue=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== One Side of the Story ===
Those reading reviews on products and services are likely to view reviews which only tell one side to the story. This is a disadvantage to both a potential customer and seller as the review may not tell the other side of a story which may be based on a misunderstanding.&lt;ref name="Britt2"&gt;{{cite web |title = Crowdsourcing: The Debate Roars On |url= http://insite.artinstitutes.edu/crowdsourcing-the-debate-roars-on-39739.aspx | first= Darice|last= Britt | accessdate= 2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox medical condition|Name=Developmental Disability |ICD9= |MeshID=D002658
| Field        = [[Psychiatry]] }}
'''Developmental disability''' is a diverse group of chronic conditions that are due to mental or physical impairments that arise before adulthood. Developmental disabilities cause individuals living with them many difficulties in certain areas of life, especially in "language, mobility, learning, self-help, and independent living".&lt;ref name =cdc&gt;Center for Disease Control and Prevention. (2013). [https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/dd Developmental disabilities.] Retrieved October 18, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Developmental disabilities can be detected early on and persist throughout an individual's lifespan. Developmental disability that affects all areas of a child's development is sometimes referred to as [[global developmental delay]].

Most common developmental disabilities:

* [[Down syndrome]] is a condition in which people are born with an extra copy of chromosome 21. Normally, a person is born with two copies of chromosome 21. However, if they are born with Down syndrome, they have an extra copy of this chromosome. This extra copy affects the development of the body and brain, causing physical and mental challenges for the individual.
* [[Fragile X syndrome]] (FXS) is thought to cause [[autism]] and intellectual disability, usually among boys. 
* [[Pervasive developmental disorders]] (PDD) are a group of developmental disabilities that can cause significant social, communication and behavioral challenges.  
* [[Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder|Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders]] (FASD) are a group of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. 
* [[Cerebral palsy]] (CP) is a group of disorders that affect a person’s ability to move and maintain balance and posture. CP is the most common motor disability in childhood.&lt;ref name =cdc/&gt;
* [[Intellectual disability]], also (sometimes proscriptively) known as mental retardation,&lt;!--see talk page: there is currently consensus to mention this synonym but need to distinguish it from general DD--&gt; is defined as an IQ below 70 along with limitations in adaptive functioning and onset before the age of 18 years.&lt;ref&gt;DSM-IV - Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision, published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
The causes of developmental disabilities are varied and remain unknown in a large proportion of cases. Even in cases of known etiology the line between "cause" and "effect" is not always clear, leading to difficulty in categorizing causes.&lt;ref&gt;Improving health outcomes for children and youth with developmental disabilities, A literature review/Surrey Place Services 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic factors have long been implicated in the causation of developmental disabilities. There is also a large environmental component to these conditions, and the relative contributions of [[nature versus nurture]] have been debated for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Finucane, B.(2012) Introduction to special issue on developmental disabilities. National Society of Genetic Counselors, Inc. 749-751.&lt;/ref&gt;

Current theories on causation focus on genetic factors, and over 1,000 known genetic conditions include developmental disabilities as a symptom.&lt;ref&gt;OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) (2012). Retrieved October 2013 from http://www.omim.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Developmental disabilities affect between 1 and 2% of the population in most western countries, although many government sources acknowledge that statistics are flawed in this area. The worldwide proportion of people with developmental disabilities is believed to be approximately 1.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inclusion-international.org/en/|title=Enable, Scotland -|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is twice as common in males as in females, and some researchers have found that the prevalence of mild developmental disabilities is likely to be higher in areas of poverty and deprivation, and among people of certain ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm50/5086/5086.htm |title=Valuing People&amp;nbsp;— A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century |page=16 |publisher=Secretary of State (UK) for Health |date=March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis and quantification==
Developmental disabilities can be initially suspected when a child does not reach expected [[child development stages]]. Subsequently, a [[differential diagnosis]] may be used to diagnose an underlying disease, which may include a [[physical examination]] and [[genetic test]]s.

The degree of disability can be quantified by assigning a ''developmental age'' to a person, which is age of the group into which test scores place the person. This, in turn, can be used to calculate a ''{{visible anchor|developmental quotient}}'' (DQ) as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/developmental%20quotient |title=Definition of DEVELOPMENTAL QUOTIENT |website=[[Merriam-Webster]] Dictionary |publisher= |accessdate=2014-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/developmental+quotient |title=developmental quotient (DQ) |publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]] |accessdate=2014-11-09}}, in turn citing Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; DQ = \frac{Developmental\ age}{Chronological\ age} * 100 &lt;/math&gt;

==Associated issues==

===Physical health issues===
There are many physical [[health]] factors associated with developmental disabilities. For some specific syndromes and diagnoses, these are inherent, such as poor heart function in people with Down syndrome. People with severe [[communication]] difficulties find it difficult to articulate their health needs, and without adequate support and education might not recognize [[illness|ill health]]. [[Epilepsy]], sensory problems (such as poor [[visual perception|vision]] and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]]), [[obesity]] and poor [[oral hygiene|dental health]] are over-represented in this population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.intellectualdisability.info/mental_phys_health/health_guide_adlt.htm |title=Health Guidelines for Adults with an Intellectual Disability |publisher=St. George's University of London/Down's Syndrome Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Life expectancy]] among people with developmental disabilities as a group is estimated at 20 years below average, although this is improving with advancements in adaptive and medical technologies, and as people are leading healthier, more fulfilling lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nswcid.org.au/systemic/position/health.html |title=Health and People with Intellectual Disability |publisher=NSW Council for Intellectual Disability}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some conditions (such as [[Freeman-Sheldon syndrome]]) do not impact life expectancy.

===Mental health issues (dual diagnoses)===
[[Mental health]] issues, and [[mental illness|psychiatric illnesses]], are more likely to occur in people with developmental disabilities than in the general population. A number of factors are attributed to the high incidence rate of dual diagnoses:
* The high likelihood of encountering [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] events throughout their lifetime (such as abandonment by loved ones, [[abuse]], [[bullying]] and [[harassment]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martorell|first=A.|author2=Tsakanikos E.|title=Traumatic experiences and life events in people with intellectual disability|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|year=2008|volume=21|issue=5|pages=445–448|doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e328305e60e|pmid=18650684|url=http://journals.lww.com/co-psychiatry/Abstract/2008/09000/Traumatic_experiences_and_life_events_in_people.4.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The social and developmental restrictions placed upon people with developmental disabilities (such as lack of [[education]], [[poverty]], limited [[employment]] opportunities, limited opportunities for fulfilling relationships, boredom)
* Biological factors (such as brain injury, [[epilepsy]], illicit and prescribed drug and alcohol misuse)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chaplin|first=E. |author2=Gilvarry, C. |author3=Tsakanikos E.|title=Recreational substance use patterns in adults with intellectual disability and co-morbid psychopathology|journal=Research in Developmental Disabilities|year=2011|volume=32|issue=6|pages=2981–6|doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2011.05.002|pmid=21640553|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891422211001612}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Developmental factors (such as lack of understanding of [[social norms]] and appropriate behavior, inability of those around to allow/understand expressions of grief and other human [[emotions]])
* External monitoring factor: all people with developmental disabilities that are in a federal- or state-funded residence require the resident to have some form of behavioral monitoring for each person with developmental disability at the residence. With this information psychological diagnoses are more easily given than with the general population that has less consistent monitoring.
* Access to health care providers: in the United States, all people with developmental disabilities that are in a federal- or state-funded residence require the residence to have annual visits to various health care providers. With consistent visits to health care providers more people with developmental disabilities are likely to receive appropriate treatment than the general population that is not required to visit various health care providers.

These problems are exacerbated by difficulties in diagnosis of mental health issues, and in appropriate treatment and medication, as for physical health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mind.org.uk/Information/Factsheets/Learning+disabilities/#Mental_health_problems|title=Learning Disabilities: Mental Health Problems |publisher=Mind (UK National Association for Mental Health)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.intellectualdisability.info/mental_phys_health/classification_ac.html |title=CLASSIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT OF PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IN ADULTS WITH LEARNING [INTELLECTUAL] DISABILITIES |author=Sally-Ann Cooper |publisher=St. George's}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abuse and vulnerability===
[[Abuse]] is a significant issue for people with developmental disabilities, and as a group they are regarded as [[vulnerability|vulnerable]] people in most jurisdictions. Common types of abuse include:
* [[Physical abuse]] (withholding food, hitting, punching, pushing, etc.)
* [[Neglect]] (withholding help when required, e.g., assistance with personal hygiene)
* [[Sexual abuse]] is associated with psychological disturbance. Sequeira, Howlin &amp; Hollins found that sexual abuse was associated with increased rates of mental illness and behavioural problems, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Psychological reactions to abuse were similar to those observed in the general population, but with the addition of stereotypical behaviour. The more serious the abuse, the more severe the symptoms that were reported.&lt;ref&gt;Psychological disturbance associated with sexual abuse in people with learning disabilities. Case-control study. / Sequeira, H; Howlin, P; Hollins, S.In: British Journal of Psychiatry, Vol. 183, No. NOV., 11.2003, p. 451–456.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/bjprcpsych/183/5/451.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Psychological or [[emotional abuse]] ([[verbal abuse]], [[shaming]] and belittling)
* Constraint and restrictive practices (turning off an electric wheelchair so a person cannot move)
* [[Financial abuse]] (charging unnecessary fees, holding onto pensions, wages, etc.)
* [[Legal abuse|Legal]] or civil abuse (restricted access to services)
* Systemic abuse (denied access to an appropriate service due to perceived support needs)
* Passive neglect (a caregiver's failure to provide adequate food, shelter)
Lack of education, lack of [[self-esteem]] and self-advocacy skills, lack of understanding of [[social norms]] and appropriate behavior and communication difficulties are strong contributing factors to the high incidence of abuse among this population.

In addition to abuse from people in positions of power, [[peer abuse]] is recognized as a significant, if misunderstood, problem. Rates of criminal offense among people with developmental disabilities are also disproportionately high, and it is widely acknowledged that criminal justice systems throughout the world are ill-equipped for the needs of people with developmental disabilities—as both perpetrators and victims of crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thearc.org/faqs/sexualabuse.doc |title=Sexual Abuse FAQ |format=DOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ncfv-cnivf/publications/fvmentalhandicap-eng.php |title=Family Violence and People with a Mental Handicap |publisher=Public Health Agency of Canada |work=National Clearinghouse on Family Violence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thearc.org/faqs/crimjustice.doc |title=Criminal Justice FAQ |publisher=The Arc of the United States |format=DOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Failings in care have been identified in one in eight deaths of people with learning difficulties under NHS England.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44001170 Failings in learning disability deaths, report finds] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenging behavior===
{{Main|Challenging behaviour}}
Some people with developmental disabilities exhibit challenging behavior, defined as "culturally abnormal behaviour(s) of such intensity, frequency or duration that the physical safety of the person or others is placed in serious jeopardy, or behaviour which is likely to seriously limit or deny access to the use of ordinary community facilities".&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, E. 1995. ''Challenging behaviour: analysis and intervention with people with learning difficulties''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Common types of challenging behavior include self-injurious behavior (such as hitting, headbutting, biting), aggressive behavior (such as hitting others, shouting, screaming, spitting, kicking, swearing, hairpulling), inappropriate sexualized behavior (such as public masturbation or groping), behavior directed at property (such as throwing objects and stealing) and stereotyped behaviors (such as repetitive rocking, [[echolalia]] or elective incontinence). Such behaviors can be assessed to suggest areas of further improvement, using assessment tools such as the [[Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (NCBRF)]].

Challenging behavior in people with developmental disabilities may be caused by a number of factors, including biological (pain, medication, the need for sensory stimulation), social (boredom, seeking social interaction, the need for an element of control, lack of knowledge of community norms, insensitivity of staff and services to the person's wishes and needs), environmental (physical aspects such as noise and lighting, or gaining access to preferred objects or activities), psychological (feeling excluded, lonely, devalued, labelled, disempowered, living up to people's negative expectations) or simply a means of communication. A lot of the time, challenging behavior is learned and brings rewards and it is very often possible to teach people new behaviors to achieve the same aims. Challenging behavior in people with developmental disabilities can often be associated with specific mental health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hemmings|first=C. |author2=Underwood, L. |author3=Tsakanikos E. |author4=Holt, G. |author5=Bouras, N. |title=Clinical predictors of challenging behaviour in intellectual disability|journal=Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology|year=2008|volume=43|issue=10|pages=824–830|doi=10.1007/s00127-008-0370-9|pmid=18488127|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/v18g5123g4gw6326/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experience and research suggests that what professionals call "challenging behavior" is often a reaction to the challenging environments that those providing services create around people with developmental disabilities. "Challenging behavior" in this context is a method of communicating dissatisfaction with the failure of those providing services to focus on what kind of life makes most sense to the person, and is often the only recourse a developmentally disabled person has against unsatisfactory services or treatment and the lack of opportunities made available to the person. This is especially the case where the services deliver lifestyles and ways of working that are centered on what suits the service provider and its staff, rather than what best suits the person.

In general, behavioral interventions or what has been termed [[applied behavior analysis]] has been found to be effective in reducing specific challenging behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neef|first= N. A. |year=2001 |title=The Past and Future of Behavior Analysis in Developmental Disabilities: When Good News is Bad and Bad News is Good. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 2 (4) ' |pages=336–343|url= http://www.baojournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, efforts have been placed on developing a developmental pathway model in the behavior analysis literature to prevent challenging behavior from occurring.&lt;ref&gt;Roane, H.S., Ringdahl, J.E., Vollmer, T.R.,  Whitmarsh, E.L. and  Marcus, B.A. (2007).  A Preliminary Description of the Occurrence of Proto-injurious Behavior in Typically Developing Children. ''Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention, 3(4),'' 334-347. [http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societal attitudes==
Throughout history, people with developmental disabilities have been viewed as incapable and incompetent in their capacity for decision-making and development. Until the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe, care and asylum was provided by families and the Church (in monasteries and other religious communities), focusing on the provision of [[Maslow's hierarchy|basic physical needs]] such as food, shelter and clothing. Stereotypes such as the dimwitted [[village idiot]],  and potentially harmful characterizations (such as [[demonic possession]] for people with epilepsy) were prominent in social attitudes of the time.

Early in the twentieth century, the [[eugenics]] movement became popular throughout the world. This led to the [[forced sterilization]] and prohibition of marriage in most of the developed world and was later used by [[Hitler]] as rationale for the mass murder of mentally challenged individuals during the [[Holocaust]]. The eugenics movement was later thought to be seriously flawed and in violation of human rights and the practice of forced sterilization and prohibition from marriage was discontinued by most of the developed world by the mid 20th century.

The movement towards individualism in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the opportunities afforded by the [[Industrial Revolution]], led to housing and care using the asylum model. People were placed by, or removed from, their families (usually in infancy) and housed in large institutions (of up to 3,000 people, although some institutions were home to many more, such as the [[Philadelphia State Hospital]] in Pennsylvania which housed 7,000 people through the 1960s), many of which were self-sufficient through the labor of the residents. Some of these institutions provided a very basic level of education (such as differentiation between colors and basic word recognition and numeracy), but most continued to focus solely on the provision of basic needs. Conditions in such institutions varied widely, but the support provided was generally non-individualized, with aberrant behavior and low levels of economic productivity regarded as a burden to society. Heavy tranquilization and assembly line methods of support (such as "birdfeeding" and cattle herding){{clarify|date=November 2015}} were the norm, and the [[medical model of disability]] prevailed. Services were provided based on the relative ease to the provider, not based on the human needs of the individual.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Ignoring the prevailing attitude, [[Civitan International|Civitans]] adopted service to the developmentally disabled as a major organizational emphasis in 1952. Their earliest efforts included workshops for special education teachers and daycamps for disabled children, all at a time when such training and programs were almost nonexistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Armbrester |first=Margaret E. |title=The Civitan Story |year=1992 |publisher=Ebsco Media |location=Birmingham, AL |pages=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the segregation of people with developmental disabilities wasn't widely questioned by academics or policy-makers until the 1969 publication of [[Wolf Wolfensberger]]'s seminal work "The Origin and Nature of Our Institutional Models",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Wolf Wolfensberger |title=The Origin and Nature of Our Institutional Models |url=http://www.disabilitymuseum.org/lib/docs/1909.htm?page=print |date=January 10, 1969 |publisher=President's Committee on Mental Retardation, Washington, D.C. |work=Changing Patterns in Residential Services for the Mentally Retarded}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on some of the ideas proposed by SG Howe 100 years earlier. This book posited that society characterizes people with disabilities as [[deviant]], sub-human and burdens of charity, resulting in the adoption of that "deviant" role. Wolfensberger argued that this dehumanization, and the segregated institutions that result from it, ignored the potential productive contributions that all people can make to society. He pushed for a shift in policy and practice that recognized the human needs of "retardates" and provided the same basic human rights as for the rest of the population.

The publication of this book may be regarded as the first move towards the widespread adoption of the [[social model of disability]] in regard to these types of disabilities, and was the impetus for the development of government strategies for desegregation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}Successful [[lawsuit]]s against governments and an increasing awareness of human rights and self-advocacy also contributed to this process, resulting in the passing in the U.S. of the [[Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act]] in 1980.

From the 1960s to the present, most U.S. states have moved towards the elimination of segregated institutions. Along with the work of Wolfensberger and others including Gunnar and Rosemary Dybwad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.disabilitymuseum.org/beyond-affliction/ba_shows.dir/revoluti.dir/highlights/subject/ng0002tx.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711075247/http://www.disabilitymuseum.org/beyond-affliction/ba_shows.dir/revoluti.dir/highlights/subject/ng0002tx.html |archivedate=2010-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of scandalous revelations around the horrific conditions within state institutions created public outrage that led to change to a more community-based method of providing services.&lt;ref name=arcmass&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arcmass.org/StateHousePolicy/RegulationandPolicyDebates/FernaldSchoolClosingandRICCIClass/FernaldNews/WhyTheFernaldCenterShouldClose/ChristmasinPurgatoryWillowbrook/tabid/692/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711170039/http://www.arcmass.org/StateHousePolicy/RegulationandPolicyDebates/FernaldSchoolClosingandRICCIClass/FernaldNews/WhyTheFernaldCenterShouldClose/ChristmasinPurgatoryWillowbrook/tabid/692/Default.aspx |archivedate=2010-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the mid-1970s, most governments had committed to de-institutionalization, and had started preparing for the wholesale movement of people into the general community, in line with the principles of [[normalisation (people with disabilities)|normalization]]. In most countries, this was essentially complete by the late 1990s, although the debate over whether or not to close institutions persists in some states, including Massachusetts.&lt;ref name = arcmass/&gt;

Individuals with developmental disabilities are not fully integrated into society.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Person Centered Planning and Person Centered Approaches are seen as methods of addressing the continued labeling and exclusion of socially devalued people, such as people with a developmental disability label, encouraging a focus on the person as someone with capacities and gifts, as well as support needs.

==Services and support==
Today, support services are provided by government agencies, [[non-governmental organizations]] and by [[private sector]] providers. Support services address most aspects of life for people with developmental disabilities, and are usually theoretically based in community inclusion, using concepts such as [[social role valorization]] and increased self-determination (using models such as [[Person Centred Planning]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kormann &amp; Petronko|year=2003|title= Crisis and Revolution in Developmental Disabilities: The Dilemma of Community Based Services. ''The Behavior Analyst Today,  3 (4,'' |pages=434–443 |url=http://www.baojournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support services are funded through government block funding (paid directly to service providers by the government), through individualized funding packages (paid directly to the individual by the government, specifically for the purchase of services) or privately by the individual (although they may receive certain subsidies or discounts, paid by the government). There also are a number of non-profit agencies dedicated to enriching the lives of people living with developmental disabilities and erasing the barriers they have to being included in their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.JARC.org|title=Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and training===
{{Main|Special education}}
Education and training opportunities for people with developmental disabilities have expanded greatly in recent times, with many governments mandating universal access to educational facilities, and more students moving out of [[special school]]s and into [[mainstreaming in education|mainstream]] classrooms with support.

[[Post-secondary education]] and [[vocational education|vocational training]] is also increasing for people with these types of disabilities, although many programs offer only segregated "access" courses in areas such as [[literacy]], [[numeracy]] and other basic skills. Legislation (such as the UK's [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]]) requires educational institutions and training providers to make "reasonable adjustments" to curriculum and teaching methods in order to accommodate the learning needs of students with disabilities, wherever possible. There are also some vocational training centers that cater specifically to people with disabilities, providing the skills necessary to work in integrated settings, one of the largest being [[Dale Rogers Training Center]] in [[Oklahoma City]]. (See also [[Intensive interaction]])

===At-home and community support===
Many people with developmental disabilities live in the general community, either with family members, in supervised-group homes or in their own homes (that they rent or own, living alone or with [[flatmate]]s). At-home and community supports range from one-to-one assistance from a support worker with identified aspects of daily living (such as [[budgeting]], [[shopping]] or paying bills) to full 24-hour support (including assistance with household tasks, such as [[cooking]] and [[Housekeeping|cleaning]], and personal care such as showering, dressing and the administration of medication). The need for full 24-hour support is usually associated with difficulties recognizing safety issues (such as responding to a fire or using a telephone) or for people with potentially dangerous medical conditions (such as asthma or diabetes) who are unable to manage their conditions without assistance.

In the [[United States]], a support worker is known as a [[Direct Support Professional]] (DSP). The DSP works in assisting the individual with their ADLs and also acts as an [[advocate]] for the individual with a developmental disability, in communicating their needs, self-expression and [[objective (goal)|goals]].

Supports of this type also include assistance to identify and undertake new hobbies or to access community services (such as education), learning appropriate behavior or recognition of community norms, or with relationships and expanding circles of friends. Most programs offering at-home and community support are designed with the goal of increasing the individual's independence, although it is recognized that people with more severe disabilities may never be able to achieve full independence in some areas of daily life.

===Residential accommodation===

Some people with developmental disabilities live in residential accommodation (also known as '''group homes''') with other people with similar assessed needs. These homes are usually staffed around the clock, and usually house between 3 and 15 residents. The prevalence of this type of support is gradually decreasing, however, as residential accommodation is replaced by at-home and community support, which can offer increased choice and self-determination for individuals. Some U.S. states still provide institutional care, such as the [[Texas State Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dads.state.tx.us/services/stateschools/index.html Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206001450/http://www.dads.state.tx.us/services/stateschools/index.html |date=February 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of residential accommodation is usually determined by the level of developmental disability and mental health needs.&lt;ref&gt;Chaplin, E., Paschos, D. O’Hara, J., McCarthy, J., Holt, G.Bouras, N. Tsakanikos E. (2010). Mental ill-health and care pathways in adults with intellectual disability across different residential settings. Research in Developmental Disabilities, 31, 458-63&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment support===
Employment support usually consists of two types of support:
* Support to access or participate in integrated employment, in a workplace in the general community. This may include specific programs to increase the skills needed for successful employment (work preparation), one-to-one or small group support for on-the-job training, or one-to-one or small group support after a transition period (such as advocacy when dealing with an employer or a bullying colleague, or assistance to complete an application for a promotion).
* The provision of specific employment opportunities within segregated '''business services'''. Although these are designed as "transitional" services (teaching work skills needed to move into integrated employment), many people remain in such services for the duration of their working life. The types of work performed in business services include mailing and packaging services, cleaning, gardening and landscaping, timberwork, metal fabrication, farming and sewing.

Workers with developmental disabilities have historically been paid less for their labor than those in the general workforce, although this is gradually changing with government initiatives, the enforcement of anti-discrimination legislation and changes in perceptions of capability in the general community.

In the United States, a variety of initiatives have been launched in the past decade to reduce unemployment among workers with disabilities—estimated by researchers at over 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Richard Burkhauser |author2=Mary Daly |title=United States Disability Policy in a Changing Environment |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives  |volume=16 |issue=1 |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these initiatives are directed at employment in mainstream businesses. They include heightened placement efforts by the community agencies serving people with developmental disabilities, as well as by government agencies.

Additionally, state-level initiatives are being launched to increase employment among workers with disabilities. In California, the state senate in 2009 created the Senate Select Committee on Autism and Related Disorders. The Committee has been examining additions to existing community employment services, and also new employment approaches. Committee member Lou Vismara, chairman of the MIND Institute at [[University of California, Davis]], is pursuing the development of a planned community for persons with autism and related disorders in the [[Sacramento]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.disabilityrightsca.org/news/Sacramento_Bee-2009-09-18.htm |title=With Housing that Caters to All, We all Win |publisher=Sacramento Bee |date=2008-09-18 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another committee member, [[Michael S. Bernick|Michael Bernick]], the former director of the state labor department, has established a program at the California state university system, starting at [[California State University East Bay]], to support students with autism on the college level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/08/04/EDPN193F67.DTL |title=College for Autistics |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Committee efforts include mutual support employment efforts, such as disability job networks, job boards, and identifying business lines that build on the strengths of persons with disabilities.

===Day services===
Non-vocational day services are usually known as '''day centers''', and are traditionally segregated services offering training in life skills (such as meal preparation and basic literacy), center-based activities (such as crafts, games and music classes) and external activities (such as day trips). Some more progressive day centers also support people to access vocational training opportunities (such as college courses), and offer individualized outreach services (planning and undertaking activities with the individual, with support offered one-to-one or in small groups).

Traditional day centers were based on the principles of [[occupational therapy]], and were created as [[respite care|respite]] for family members caring for their loved ones with disabilities. This is slowly changing, however, as programs offered become more skills-based and focused on increasing independence.

===Advocacy===
[[Advocacy]] is a burgeoning support field for people with developmental disabilities. Advocacy groups now exist in most jurisdictions, working collaboratively with people with disabilities for systemic change (such as changes in policy and legislation) and for changes for individuals (such as claiming welfare benefits or when responding to abuse). Most advocacy groups also work to support people, throughout the world, to increase their capacity for [[self-advocacy]], teaching the skills necessary for people to advocate for their own needs.

===Other types of support===
Other types of support for people with developmental disabilities may include:
* therapeutic services, such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, massage, aromatherapy, art, dance/movement or music therapy
* supported holidays
* short-stay respite services (for people who live with family members or other unpaid carers)
* transport services, such as dial-a-ride or free bus passes
* specialist behavior support services, such as high-security services for people with high-level, high-risk challenging behaviors
* specialist relationships and sex education

Programs are set up around the country in hopes to educate individuals with and without developmental disabilities. Studies have been done testing specific scenarios on how what is the most beneficial way to educate people. Interventions are a great way to educate people, but also the most time consuming. With the busy schedules that everybody has, it is found to be difficult to go about the intervention approach. Another scenario that was found to be not as beneficial, but more realistic in the time sense was Psychoeducational approach. They focus on informing people on what abuse is, how to spot abuse, and what to do when spotted. Individuals with developmental disabilities don't only need the support programs to keep them safe, but everybody in society needs to be aware of what is happening and how to help everybody prosper.&lt;ref&gt;Lund, Emily, and Marilyn Hammond. “Single-Session Intervention for Abuse Awareness Among
People with Developmental Disabilities.” Sexuality and Disability 32.1 (n.d.): 99-105. Proquest Central. Web. 24 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3476">'''E-LOTOS (Enhanced LOTOS)''' is a [[formal methods|formal]] [[specification language]] designed between 1993 and 1999, and standardized by [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=27680 ISO/IEC international standard 15437:2001]. Information technology - Enhancements to LOTOS (E-LOTOS). Geneva, September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

E-LOTOS was initially intended to be as a revision of the [[Language Of Temporal Ordering Specification|LOTOS]] language standardized by ISO 8807 in 1989. But the revision turned out to be profound, leading to a new specification language.

The starting point for the revision of LOTOS was the PhD thesis&lt;ref&gt;Ed Brinksma. ''On the Design of Extended LOTOS - A Specification Language for Open Distributed Systems'', PhD thesis, University of Twente, Nov. 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; of Ed Brinksma, who had been the Rapporteur at ISO of the LOTOS standard.

In 1993, the initial goals of the definition of E-LOTOS have been stated in this announcement&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC JTC1/N2802, Proposal for a New Work Item on "Enhancements to LOTOS. December 16, 1993. Available from ftp://ftp.inrialpes.fr/pub/vasy/publications/elotos/announce-93.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, when the language definition reached the maturity level of an ISO Committee Draft, the following announcement&lt;ref&gt;Juan Quemada. ''E-LOTOS has born'', February 18, 1997. Available from ftp://ftp.inrialpes.fr/pub/vasy/publications/elotos/announce-97.txt&lt;/ref&gt; was posted, which describes the main features of E-LOTOS.

The following document&lt;ref&gt;Juan Quemada. ''Description of the E-LOTOS New Work Item''. June 16, 1998. Available from ftp://ftp.inrialpes.fr/pub/vasy/publications/elotos/announce-98.txt&lt;/ref&gt; recalls the milestones of E-LOTOS definition project.

E-LOTOS has inspired descendent languages&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Garavel, Frédéric Lang, and Wendelin Serwe, From LOTOS to LNT.

'''ECOWEEK''' ''Εβδομάδα Οικολογίας'' (Greek) is a private non-profit, non-governmental international organization aiming towards the empowerment, networking, education and training of young professionals - architects, designers, engineers, landscape architects - towards sustainable urban and public interventions and facilitation of action through fieldwork, workshops, education and training and through cooperation with local authorities, organizations and leaders.

== Mission ==
ECOWEEK mission is to raise environmental awareness and awareness on [[climate change]] and to promote the principles of [[sustainability]].

== History ==
ECOWEEK was initially established in Aegina, Greece in 2005. It was initially conceived as a community event - ''Ecological Week in Aegina'' - to raise environmental awareness of the local community of 14,000. At the time Aegina was challenged by unresolved waste management,&lt;ref&gt;Ζουμπουλάκης, Γ. (7-08-2005). ''Χωρίς νερό αλλά με σκουπίδια - Αίγινα''. ΤΟ ΒΗΜΑ - http://www.tovima.gr/relatedarticles/article/?aid=167683&lt;/ref&gt; illegal burning of waste, inexistant waste recycling program, water shortages,&lt;ref&gt;Χριστοδουλίδου, Π. (9-08-2005). ''Άρχισε ξανά η μεταφορά νερού στην Αίγινα''. ΤΟ ΕΘΝΟΣ - http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22733&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=11058&lt;/ref&gt; energy shortages, and a thriving and partially unregulated spec construction market for summer houses, which although contributed to the local economy, it put pressure in protected areas to be developed and constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Petropoulos, Thracy. (1-06-2007). ''Concrete plans unsettled''. ATHENS NEWS - http://www.aeginagreece.com/main/aegina_eco/cementfactory.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Construction also contributed in increasing illegal disposal of construction waste in natural reserves, and the increase of the summer population thus bringing the capacity of the existing infrastructures of the island to its limits.

Ecological Week in Aegina was held in Aegina for 2 years. In 2007, responding to an increase demand for environmental awareness beyond Aegina, ECOWEEK co-organized activity throughout Greece, and initiated free-admission screenings of award-winning documentary on Climate Change by Davis Guggenheim ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' with [[Al Gore]] in schools, the army, and public screenings in Athens, Thessaloniki, Patras, Lamia, Corfu, and Crete. Within this activity, in June 2007, ECOWEEK held a public free-admission keynote lecture and slide show on Climate Change by inviting Al Gore&lt;ref&gt;Πολιτισμός. (22-5-2007). ''Ο Αλ Γκορ στο Μέγαρο Μουσικής''. ΤΟ ΕΘΝΟΣ - http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22784&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=110309&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Athens Concert Hall]]. In 2007 ECOWEEK was also established in Jerusalem, Israel and in 2008 ECOWEEK initiated the first Ecological Week in [[Larnaka]], [[Cyprus]], in cooperation with the Municipality of Larnaka], involving schools, universities, professional organizations, and the general public.

== Programs ==
Since 2005, ECOWEEK developed its outreach activity towards raising awareness to a variety of population groups, age-groups and interests. For example, from children activity, cleaning of beaches, lottery of composters and solar chargers, to academic and colloquial lectures, site visits, design workshops, and film screenings.
Since 2008, ECOWEEK activity focuses more on sustainable design and ecological building, social design,and [[placemaking]]. Its activity involved primarily one-week-long design workshops and international conferences for young and established professionals - primarily architects, designers, landscape architects and engineers. ECOWEEK has developed and expanded its activity through close collaboration with cultural institutions, such as the [[American Institute of Architects]] Continental Europe, the [[British Council]], [[Goethe Institute]], academic institutions, municipalities and governments. ECOWEEK has initiated and organized activities in [[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Ag. Nikolaos]] ([[Crete]]), [[Athens]], [[Bethany (biblical village)|Azaryia]] ([[Bethany (biblical village)|Bethany]]), [[Belgrade]], [[Bucharest]], [[Cairns]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Istanbul]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Kraków]], [[London]], [[Milan]]o, [[Mumbai]], [[Sarajevo]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Thessaloniki]], [[Tilburg]], [[Pristina|Prishtina]], and [[Rome]].

In 2017 ECOWEEK published its first book titled [http://ecoweekbook.org/ ECOWEEK Book#1: 50 Voices for Sustainability], featuring fifty articles by leading architects,designers, professionals, academics and environmentalists from around the world. Among them award-winning architects [[Kengo Kuma]], [[Bjarke Ingels|BIG]], [[MVRDV]], [[Françoise-Hélène Jourda|Francoise-Helene Jourda]], [[Diébédo Francis Kéré|Diebedo Francis Kere]], [[Michael Sorkin]], Prof. David Orr and Antarctica explorer [[Robert Swan]]. The same year ECOWEEK also issued [https://issuu.com/ecoweek/docs/ecoweek_catalogue_2016 ECOWEEK: The Workshops] a publication with a collection of ideas and projects from the ECOWEEK workshops (2009-2016).

== Hassan Fathy ==
In 1989 ECOWEEK co-founder architect Elias Messinas met the late Egyptian architect [[Hassan Fathy]] - author of [[Architecture for the Poor]] - in [[Cairo]]. In that meeting, Fathy conveyed to Messinas how problems in Egypt - among them housing for the poor - could be solved. Among others Fathy challenged Messinas when he emphasized the need for young professionals to be more aware of their own community and instead of imitating architecture in international magazines, to reach out, learn about and be creative while benefiting with their work their own community.

Inspired by Fathy, ECOWEEK workshops have gradually developed a more hands-on approach that links between acedemia and the community, and between professionals and students since 2010. Aiming to both empower and train young professionals to address urban public space, placemaking, urban communities through interventions in design and hands-on workshops in urban public context, ECOWEEK and its partners have developed a model of close collaboration with local authorities, local organizations and leaders. Through this collaboration, the ECOWEEK workshops are assigned projects that are real, support them with professional consultants and see that some of the projects are implemented. Students' ideas are heard and cities, neighborhoods and communities benefit from the innovative and creative ideas of students and the professional guidance of the workshop leaders. The ECOWEEK workshops have developed sustainable proposals for ''Copenhagen,&lt;ref&gt;Oxgren, Dorthe. (15-05-2013).'' Studerende skal gore Nordvest gronnere.

[[File:Ecoweek greenhouse.jpg|thumb|right]]
Aiming to establish a permanent platform and not just one-week-long activity, ECOWEEK established the GREENHOUSE in 2011 in Athens, Greece. The GREENHOUSE is a platform for innovation and entrepreneurship for society and the environment, engaging young architects, designers, landscape architects and students in real design assignments for real non-profit organizations and local authorities. The GREENHOUSE teams, under the guidance of experienced professionals, have developed sustainable solutions for schools, community centers, [https://ecoweekorg.wixsite.com/ghath2017 welfare institutions] and the urban public space in Athens and Thessaloniki in Greece and Holon,&lt;ref&gt;(20-05-2013).

The '''''European Papers on the New Welfare''''' are a series of papers in English (with an Italian version) published since 2005 by [[The Risk Institute]] ([[Geneva]], [[Trieste]], [[Zagreb]]). The subtitle of the series, "The Counter-ageing Society", underlines the major goal: to promote and to publish studies, based on academic analyses and practical experiences, on issues related to the lengthening of the life cycle. This involves the understanding and monitoring of the impact of scientific advances in many fields ([[biology]], [[medicine]], [[gerontology]], [[communications]], etc.). Key is the promotion of an active life well beyond 60 years of age, and developing adequate learning and education systems as societal integration tools. All this in view of many reforms needed to develop a sustainable New Welfare (including employment, pensions schemes, health and ageing, etc.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8035">'''Expeditionary Learning Schools''' are models of comprehensive school reform based on the educational ideas of German educator [[Kurt Hahn]], the founder of [[Outward Bound]]. There are more than 150 Expeditionary Learning Schools in 30 US states and [[Washington, D.C.|the District of Columbia]]. They are exemplified by [[project-based learning]] expeditions, where students engage in interdisciplinary, in-depth study of compelling topics, in groups and in their community, with assessment coming through cumulative products, public presentations, and portfolios. According to the ELS Web site students undertake tasks requiring perseverance, fitness, craftsmanship, imagination, self-discipline, and significant achievement.&lt;ref name=principles&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100406020411/http://www.elschools.org/aboutus/principles.html ELS website, archived 5 April 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kearns, David T&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berends, Mark (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design principles==
According to the ELS Web site the following design principles serve as a moral and cultural foundation for each Expeditionary Learning School. They express the core values and [[Philosophy of education|educational philosophy]] of Expeditionary Learning.&lt;ref name=principles/&gt;

'''The Primacy of Self-Discovery''' states that learning happens best with emotion, challenge and the requisite support. People discover their abilities, values, passions, and responsibilities in situations that offer adventure and the unexpected. The primary task of the teacher is to help students overcome their fears and discover they can do more than they thought they could.

'''The Having of Wonderful Ideas''' places emphasis on fostering curiosity about the world by creating learning situations that provide something important to think about, time to experiment, and time to make sense of what is observed.

'''The Responsibility for Learning''' argues that learning is both a personal process of discovery and a social activity. Therefore, every aspect of an Expeditionary Learning school encourages both children and adults to become increasingly responsible for directing their own personal and collective learning.

'''Empathy and Caring''' believes that learning is fostered best in communities where students' and teachers' ideas are respected and where there is mutual trust. Older students often mentor younger ones, and students feel physically and emotionally safe.

'''Success and Failure''' states the fact that all students need to be successful if they are to build the confidence and capacity to take risks and meet increasingly difficult challenges. But it is also important for students to learn from their failures, to persevere when things are hard, and to learn to turn disabilities into opportunities.

'''Collaboration and Competition''' positions Expeditionary Learning schools as integrating individual development and group development, so that the value of friendship, trust, and group action is clear. Students are encouraged to compete not against each other, but with their own personal best and with rigorous standards of excellence.

'''Diversity and Inclusion''' believes that both diversity and inclusion increase the richness of ideas, creative power, problem-solving ability, and respect for others. Schools and learning groups are heterogeneous.

'''The Natural World''' helps create a direct and respectful relationship with the natural world, which refreshes the human spirit and teaches the important ideas of recurring cycles and cause and effect. Students learn to become stewards of the earth and of future generations.

'''Solitude and Reflection''' argues that students and teachers need time alone to explore their own thoughts, make their own connections, and create their own ideas. They also need time to exchange their reflections with other students and with adults.

'''Service and Compassion''' places emphasis on strengthening students and teachers through acts of consequential service to others. One of an Expeditionary Learning school's primary functions is to prepare students with the attitudes and skills to learn from and be of service.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Expeditionary Learning - Design Principles | url=http://eleducation.org/resources/design-principles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expeditionary Learning Schools Outward Bound==
The organization [http://www.elschools.org Expeditionary Learning] is the primary organization working with schools to design and implement their programs. EL provides schools with curricular and instructional frameworks, along with strategies to change the culture of school communities. EL develops new schools and helps existing ones transition, entering into multi-year contracts with schools and [[school district]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Josheph F. and Amanda Datnow (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1992, Outward Bound’s Expeditionary Learning proposal was one of 11 selected for funding from almost 800 solicited by the New American Schools Development Corporation (NASDC) for comprehensive school reform (citation: ELS website). ELS was launched in 1993 with 10 demonstration schools in five US cities: [[New York City]]; [[Boston]]; [[Portland, Maine|Portland, ME]]; [[Denver]]; and [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque, IA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elschools.org/aboutus/principles.html ELS Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote positively about Expeditionary Learning Schools, and The [[RAND|Rand Corporation]], The American Institutes for Research, The National Staff Development Council, and The Center for Research on the Education of Students Placed At Risk (CRESPAR) have all evaluated ELS models and practices, and cite positive outcomes such as higher student achievement and participation, and a more positive and productive school culture.&lt;ref&gt;The Kauffman Foundation Website&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 CRESPAR analysis of 29 comprehensive school reform models awarded ELS the highest rating given to any model created in the previous ten years.&lt;ref&gt;Borman, Geoffrey, ''et al''.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] visited Capital City Public Charter School, an Expeditionary Learning School in Washington, DC, and said the school "is an example of how all our schools should be."&lt;ref&gt;Capital City PCS Website&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[fluid mechanics]], a [[fluid]] is said to be in '''hydrostatic equilibrium''' or '''hydrostatic balance''' when it is at rest, or when the flow velocity at each point is constant over time. This occurs when external forces such as [[gravity]] are balanced by a [[pressure-gradient force]].&lt;ref&gt;White (2008). p 63, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the pressure-gradient force prevents gravity from collapsing [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] into a thin, dense shell, whereas gravity prevents the pressure gradient force from diffusing the atmosphere into space.

Hydrostatic equilibrium is the current distinguishing criterion between [[dwarf planet]]s and [[Small Solar System body|small Solar System bodies]], and has other roles in [[astrophysics]] and [[planetary geology]]. This qualification typically means that the object is symmetrically rounded into a [[spheroid]] or [[ellipsoid]] shape, where any irregular surface features are due to a relatively thin solid [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. There are [[List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System|32 observationally confirmed&lt;!--of the DPs, only Ceres, Pluto, and Eris are obs. confirmed. the others rely on mathematical modeling.--&gt; such objects]] (apart from the Sun), sometimes called ''[[planemo]]s,''&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Stern]] considers these all to be "planets", but that conception was rejected by the [[International Astronomical Union]].&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Solar System]], seven more&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dps.html |title=Astronomer Mike Brown |publisher=Gps.caltech.edu |date=2013-11-01 |accessdate=2014-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018154917/http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dps.html |archivedate=2011-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--3 accepted by the IAU, &amp; 4 more that "must" be according to Mike Brown--&gt; that are virtually certain, and [[List of possible dwarf planets|a hundred or so more]] that are likely.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;

==Mathematical consideration==
[[File:Hydrostatic equilibrium.svg|thumb|right|If the highlighted volume of fluid is not accelerating, the forces on it upwards must equal the forces downwards.]]

===Derivation from force summation===
[[Newton's laws of motion]] state that a volume of a fluid that is not in motion or that is in a state of constant velocity must have zero net force on it. This means the sum of the forces in a given direction must be opposed by an equal sum of forces in the opposite direction. This force balance is called a hydrostatic equilibrium.

The fluid can be split into a large number of [[cuboid]] volume elements; by considering a single element, the action of the fluid can be derived.

There are 3 forces: the force downwards onto the top of the cuboid from the pressure, P, of the fluid above it is, from the definition of [[pressure]],
:&lt;math&gt;F_{top} = - P_{top} \cdot A.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the force on the volume element from the pressure of the fluid below pushing upwards is
:&lt;math&gt;F_{bottom} = P_{bottom} \cdot A.&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the [[weight]] of the volume element causes a force downwards.  If the [[density]] is ρ, the volume is V and g the [[standard gravity]], then:
:&lt;math&gt;F_{weight} = -\rho \cdot g \cdot V.&lt;/math&gt;
The volume of this cuboid is equal to the area of the top or bottom, times the height&amp;nbsp;— the formula for finding the volume of a cube.
:&lt;math&gt;F_{weight} = -\rho \cdot g \cdot A \cdot h&lt;/math&gt;

By balancing these forces, the total force on the fluid is
:&lt;math&gt;\sum F = F_{bottom} + F_{top} + F_{weight} = P_{bottom} \cdot A - P_{top} \cdot A - \rho \cdot g \cdot A \cdot h.&lt;/math&gt;
This sum equals zero if the fluid's velocity is constant.  Dividing by A,
:&lt;math&gt;0 = P_{bottom} - P_{top} - \rho \cdot g \cdot h.&lt;/math&gt;
Or,
:&lt;math&gt;P_{top} - P_{bottom} = - \rho \cdot g \cdot h.&lt;/math&gt;
P&lt;sub&gt;top&lt;/sub&gt; − P&lt;sub&gt;bottom&lt;/sub&gt; is a change in pressure, and h is the height of the volume element—a change in the distance above the ground.  By saying these changes are [[infinitesimal]]ly small, the equation can be written in [[differential equation|differential]] form.
:&lt;math&gt;dP = - \rho \cdot g \cdot dh.&lt;/math&gt;
Density changes with pressure, and gravity changes with height, so the equation would be:
:&lt;math&gt;dP = - \rho(P) \cdot g(h) \cdot dh.&lt;/math&gt;

===Derivation from Navier–Stokes equations===
Note finally that this last equation can be derived by solving the three-dimensional [[Navier–Stokes equations]] for the equilibrium situation where
:&lt;math&gt;u=v=\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}=0.&lt;/math&gt;
Then the only non-trivial equation is the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-equation, which now reads
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}+\rho g=0.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, hydrostatic balance can be regarded as a particularly simple equilibrium solution of the Navier–Stokes equations.

===Derivation from general relativity===
By plugging the energy momentum tensor for a [[perfect fluid]]
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\nu}=(\rho c^{-2}+P)u^\mu u^\nu+Pg^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;
into the [[Einstein field equations]]
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\mu\nu}=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}(T_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}T)&lt;/math&gt;
and using the conservation condition
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu}=0&lt;/math&gt;
one can derive the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation]] for the structure of a static, spherically symmetric relativistic star in isotropic coordinates:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dr}=-\frac{G M(r)\rho(r)}{r^2}\left(1+\frac{P(r)}{\rho(r)c^2}\right)\left(1+\frac{4\pi r^3P(r)}{M(r)c^2}\right)\left(1-\frac{2GM(r)}{r c^2}\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
In practice, ''Ρ'' and ''ρ'' are related by an equation of state of the form ''f''(''Ρ'',''ρ'')=0, with ''f'' specific to makeup of the star. ''M''(''r'') is a foliation of spheres weighted by the mass density ''ρ''(''r''), with the largest sphere having radius ''r'':
:&lt;math&gt;M(r)=4\pi\int_0^r dr' r'^2\rho(r').&lt;/math&gt;
Per standard procedure in taking the nonrelativistic limit, we let ''c''→∞, so that the factor
:&lt;math&gt;\left(1+\frac{P(r)}{\rho(r)c^2}\right)\left(1+\frac{4\pi r^3P(r)}{M(r)c^2}\right)\left(1-\frac{2GM(r)}{r c^2}\right)^{-1}\rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, in the nonrelativistic limit the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation reduces to Newton's hydrostatic equilibrium:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dr}=-\frac{GM(r)\rho(r)}{r^2}=-g(r)\,\rho(r)\longrightarrow dP = - \rho(h)\,g(h)\, dh&lt;/math&gt;
(we have made the trivial notation change ''h''=''r'' and have used ''f''(''Ρ'',''ρ'')=0 to express ''ρ'' in terms of ''P'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zee|first1=A.|title=Einstein gravity in a nutshell|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=9780691145587|pages=451–454}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar equation can be computed for rotating, axially symmetric stars, which in its gauge independent form reads:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial_i P}{P+\rho} - \partial_i \ln u^t + u_t u^{\phi}\partial_i\frac{u_{\phi}}{u_t}=0&lt;/math&gt; 
Unlike the TOV equilibrium equation, these are two equations (for instance, if as usual when treating stars, one chooses spherical coordinates as basis coordinates &lt;math&gt;(t,r,\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, the index ''i'' runs for the coordinates ''r'' and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;).

==Applications==

===Fluids===
The hydrostatic equilibrium pertains to [[hydrostatics]] and the [[principles of equilibrium]] of [[fluid]]s.  A hydrostatic balance is a particular balance for weighing substances in water.  Hydrostatic balance allows the [[discovery (observation)|discovery]] of their [[specific gravity|specific gravities]].

===Astrophysics===
In any given layer of a [[star]], there is a hydrostatic equilibrium between the outward thermal pressure from below and the weight of the material above pressing inward.  The [[isotropic]] gravitational field compresses the star into the most compact shape possible. A rotating star in hydrostatic equilibrium is an [[oblate spheroid]] up to a certain (critical) angular velocity. An extreme example of this phenomenon is the star [[Vega]], which has a rotation period of 12.5 hours. Consequently, Vega is about 20% larger at the equator than at the poles. A star with an angular velocity above the critical angular velocity becomes a [[Jacobi ellipsoid|Jacobi (scalene) ellipsoid]], and at still faster rotation it is no longer ellipsoidal but [[wikt:pyriform|piriform]] or [[oviform]], with yet other shapes beyond that, though shapes beyond scalene are not stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.josleys.com/show_gallery.php?galid=313 |title=Gallery : The shape of Planet Earth |publisher=Josleys.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the star has a massive nearby companion object then [[tidal force]]s come into play as well, distorting the star into a scalene shape when rotation alone would make it a spheroid.  An example of this is [[Beta Lyrae]].

Hydrostatic equilibrium is also important for the [[intracluster medium]], where it restricts the amount of fluid that can be present in the core of a [[cluster of galaxies]].

We can also use the principle of hydrostatic equilibrium to estimate the [[velocity dispersion]] of [[dark matter]] in clusters of galaxies. Only [[baryon]]ic matter (or, rather, the collisions thereof) emits [[X-ray]] radiation. The absolute X-ray [[luminosity]] per unit volume takes the form &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_X=\Lambda(T_B)\rho_B^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;T_B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_B&lt;/math&gt; are the temperature and density of the baryonic matter, and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda(T)&lt;/math&gt; is some function of temperature and fundamental constants. The baryonic density satisfies the above equation &lt;math&gt;dP=-\rho gdr&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;p_B(r+dr)-p_B(r)=-dr\frac{\rho_B(r)G}{r^2}\int_0^r 4\pi r^2\,\rho_M(r)\, dr.&lt;/math&gt;
The integral is a measure of the total mass of the cluster, with &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; being the proper distance to the center of the cluster. Using the [[ideal gas law]] &lt;math&gt;p_B=kT_B\rho_B/m_B&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]] and &lt;math&gt;m_B&lt;/math&gt; is a characteristic mass of the baryonic gas particles) and rearranging, we arrive at
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{kT_B(r)\rho_B(r)}{m_B}\right)=-\frac{\rho_B(r)G}{r^2}\int_0^r 4\pi r^2\,\rho_M(r)\, dr.&lt;/math&gt;
Multiplying by &lt;math&gt;r^2/\rho_B(r)&lt;/math&gt; and differentiating with respect to &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dr}\left[\frac{r^2}{\rho_B(r)}\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{kT_B(r)\rho_B(r)}{m_B}\right)\right]=-4\pi Gr^2\rho_M(r).&lt;/math&gt;
If we make the assumption that cold dark matter particles have an isotropic velocity distribution, then the same derivation applies to these particles, and their density &lt;math&gt;\rho_D=\rho_M-\rho_B&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the non-linear differential equation
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dr}\left[\frac{r^2}{\rho_D(r)}\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{kT_D(r)\rho_D(r)}{m_D}\right)\right]=-4\pi Gr^2\rho_M(r).&lt;/math&gt;
With perfect X-ray and distance data, we could calculate the baryon density at each point in the cluster and thus the dark matter density. We could then calculate the velocity dispersion &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_D&lt;/math&gt; of the dark matter, which is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_D=\frac{kT_D}{m_D}.&lt;/math&gt; 
The central density ratio &lt;math&gt;\rho_B(0)/\rho_M(0)&lt;/math&gt; is dependent on the [[redshift]] &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; of the cluster and is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_B(0)/\rho_M(0)\propto (1+z)^2\left(\frac{\theta}{s}\right)^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angular width of the cluster and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; the proper distance to the cluster. Values for the ratio range from .11 to .14 for various surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weinberg|first1=Steven|title=Cosmology|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-852682-7|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planetary geology===
The concept of hydrostatic equilibrium has also become important in determining whether an astronomical object is a [[planet]], [[dwarf planet]], or [[small Solar System body]]. According to the [[definition of planet]] adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 2006, one defining characteristic of planets and dwarf planets is that they are objects that have sufficient gravity to overcome their own rigidity and assume hydrostatic equilibrium. Such a body will normally have the differentiated interior and geology of a world (a [[planemo]]), though near-hydrostatic bodies such as the proto-planet [[4 Vesta]] may also be differentiated. Sometimes the equilibrium shape is an [[oblate spheroid]], as is the case with Earth. However, in the cases of moons in synchronous orbit, nearly unidirectional tidal forces create a [[scalene ellipsoid]]. Also, the dwarf planet {{dp|Haumea}} is scalene due to its rapid rotation.

It had been thought that icy objects with a diameter larger than roughly 400&amp;nbsp;km are usually in hydrostatic equilibrium, whereas those smaller than that are not. Icy objects need less mass for hydrostatic equilibrium than rocky objects. The smallest object that is known to have an equilibrium shape is the icy moon [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] at 397&amp;nbsp;km, whereas the largest object known to have an obviously non-equilibrium shape is the rocky asteroid [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] at 532&amp;nbsp;km (582&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;556&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;500&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;18&amp;nbsp;km). However, Mimas is not actually in hydrostatic equilibrium for its current rotation. The smallest body confirmed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium is the dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], at 945 km, whereas the largest body known to not be in hydrostatic equilibrium is the icy moon [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]], at 1,470&amp;nbsp;km.

Because the [[terrestrial planet]]s and dwarf planets (and likewise the larger [[natural satellite|satellites]], like the [[Moon]] and [[Io (moon)|Io]]) have irregular surfaces, this definition evidently has some flexibility, but a specific means of quantifying an object's shape by this standard has not yet been announced. Local irregularities may be consistent with global equilibrium. For example, the massive base of the tallest&lt;!--as opposed to highest--&gt; mountain on Earth, [[Mauna Kea]], has deformed and depressed the level of the surrounding crust, so that the overall distribution of mass approaches equilibrium. The amount of leeway afforded the definition could affect the classification of the asteroid [[4 Vesta|Vesta]], which may have solidified while in hydrostatic equilibrium but was subsequently significantly deformed by large impacts (now 572.6&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;557.2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;446.4&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name="Hubble"&gt;{{cite web

===Atmospherics===
In the atmosphere, the pressure of the air decreases with increasing altitude. This pressure difference causes an upward force called the [[pressure-gradient force]]. The force of gravity balances this out, keeping the atmosphere bound to Earth and maintaining pressure differences with altitude.

[[File:NUS_IMS_Main_building_for_the_Institute_for_Mathematical_Sciences.jpg|thumb|right|Main building for the Institute for Mathematical Sciences]]
The '''Institute for Mathematical Sciences (IMS)''' is a research institute for mathematics and its applications at the [[National University of Singapore]].  It occupies two buildings at the hilly Prince George’s Park of the university campus.

== History ==

The IMS was established in 2000 funded by the [[Singapore Ministry of Education]] for the first five years of operation. Its birth was the culmination of the efforts of many individuals with the shared vision of a mathematical institute in Singapore facilitating and supporting research in the mathematical sciences at the highest level. Soon after its opening, the IMS assumed an international profile, hosting visitors from many parts of the world. Today it organizes programs and workshops attended by more than 700 mathematical scientists each year and is a major node in the mathematical research community in the Asia-Pacific region. 

== Scientific programs ==

There are typically six programs and twenty workshops organized in a year, with up to 60 participants for each of them. A program lasts between one and three months, while workshops are of one week duration. IMS also holds graduate level summer/winter schools for and outreach programs such as public lectures and math camps. Programs and workshops are selected two years in advance by the IMS Scientific Advisory Board. They cover the entire range of mathematics and its applications.

'''Integrated geography''' (also referred to as '''integrative geography''',&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaas Auup oooo. Rupke (2008): ''Alexander Von Humboldt: A Metabiography''. [[Chicago]]: [[University of Chicago Press]]. {{ISBN|9780226731490}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''environmental geography''' or '''human–environment geography''') is the branch of [[geography]] that describes and explains the [[spatial analysis|spatial]] aspects of interactions between human individuals or societies and their natural environment,&lt;ref&gt;Noel Castree ''et al.'' (2009): ''A Companion to Environmental Geography''. [[London]]: [[Wiley-Blackwell]]. {{ISBN|9781444305739}}&lt;/ref&gt; these interactions being called [[coupled human–environment system]]s.

== Origins ==
It requires an understanding of the dynamics of [[physical geography]], as well as the ways in which human societies conceptualize the environment ([[human geography]]). Thus, to a certain degree, it may be seen as a successor of ''Physische Anthropogeographie'' (English: "physical anthropogeography")—a term coined by [[University of Vienna]] geographer [[Albrecht Penck]] in 1924&lt;ref&gt;Karlheinz Paffen (1959): Stellung und Bedeutung der Physischen Anthropogeographie. In: ''[[Erdkunde]]'' 13 (4), pp. 354–372. [https://dx.doi.org/10.3112/erdkunde.1959.04.08 DOI: 10.3112/erdkunde.1959.04.08]&lt;/ref&gt;—and geographical [[Cultural ecology|cultural]] or [[human ecology]] (Harlan H. Barrows 1923). Integrated geography in the United States is principally influenced by the schools of [[Carl O. Sauer]] (Berkeley), whose perspective was rather historical, and [[Gilbert F. White]] (Chicago), who developed a more applied view.
Integrated geography (also, integrative geography, environmental geography or human–environment geography) is the branch of geography that describes and explains the spatial aspects of interactions between human individuals or societies and their natural environment, called  [[coupled human–environment system]]s.

== Focus ==
[[File:Finley wildlife refuge.jpg|thumb|Wildlife refuge located in Oregon, United States.]]
The links between human and physical geography were once more apparent than they are today. As human experience of the world is increasingly mediated by technology, the relationships between humans and the environment have often become obscured. Thereby, integrated geography represents a critically important set of analytical tools for assessing the impact of human presence on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. This is done by measuring the result of human activity on natural landforms and cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garcia|first1=Hector|title=Environmental Geography|date=2010|publisher=Apple Academic Press, Inc.|isbn=1926686683}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods for which this information is gained include [[remote sensing]], and [[geographic information system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/921583361|title=An introduction to human-environment geography : local dynamics and global processes|last=G.|first=Moseley, William|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781405189316|oclc=921583361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrated geography helps us to ponder the environment in terms of its relationship to people. With integrated geography we can analyze different social science and humanities perspectives and their use in understanding people environment processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Human-Environment Geography|last=Moseley|first=William G.|last2=Perramond|first2=Eric|last3=Hapke|first3=Holly M.|last4=Laris|first4=Paul|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, it is considered the third branch of geography,&lt;ref&gt;David Demeritt (2009): From externality to inputs and interference: framing environmental research in geography.

== Cellular Defenses ==
In a healthy individual, immune cells patrol blood vessels to detect and respond to danger through molecules frequently found on pathogens called [[Pathogen-associated molecular pattern|PAMPs]], and molecules that are released by damaged cells, [[Damage-associated molecular pattern|DAMPs]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Immune cells involved in intravascular surveillance are [[neutrophil]]s, [[monocytes]], [[Natural killer T cell|invariant natural killer T cells]], [[kupffer cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[mast cell]]s.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; These cells express particular receptors such as [[toll-like receptor]]s and proteins like [[CD36]] that allow them to recognize and respond to danger signals.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; [[Endothelium|Endothelial cells]] lining the vasculature are also a part of the intravasculature's cellular defense system. They express molecules such as, [[CD14]], [[TLR2]], [[TLR4]], [[TLR9]], MD2, and [[MYD88|MyD88]], to detect bacteria in the blood.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Leukocytes move through blood vessels using protein-protein interactions between cells and are also assisted by [[Hemodynamics|blood flow]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Circulating immune cells behave differently in the presence and absence of an infection. For example, in the absence of an invader, monocytes migrate randomly throughout the microvasculature, cerebral vessels, and mesentery vessels. However, in the presence of an invader, monocytes emigrate to the infected area.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Similarly, neutrophils use a [[Leukocyte extravasation|rolling mechanism]] to counteract the blood flow and localize to the infected area.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In a healthy state, neutrophils have been observed to exhibit a similar but brief crawling mechanism. The function and precise mechanism is not yet known.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Immune Responses ==

=== Inflammation ===
For more details on this topic, see [[Inflammation]].

Inflammation is an immune response in the body tissue due to stimulation of immune cells by pathogens, DAMPs, or stress.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The vasculature provides a means of transportation for alerting and recruiting immune cells.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Immunothrombosis ===
Thrombosis is the formation of blood coagulation and platelet aggregation and may result in lack of blood flow through the circulatory system. The depletion of oxygen may cause irreversible damage to organs. However, in other circumstances, the physiological process can be beneficial for the body. This process is known as immunothrombosis.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The process isolates infections using blood clots formed by activated [[platelet]]s, [[White blood cell|leukocytes]], and [[Coagulation|coagulation factors]] assist leukocytes in adhering and migrating to infected areas. Activated platelets produce [[fibrin]] in the blood vessel which seal leaky vessels and are important in blood coagulation. Fibrin provides a matrix to trap pathogens and recruit immune cells. Characteristics such as elongation and thickness of fibrin and protofibril, the precursor of fibrin, are determined by many factors including environmental conditions, physiological conditions, and branching of the fibrin fibers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; This in turn influences the clot structure such as permeability, stiffness, and how easily the clot can be retracted. The shift from immunothrombosis to a more pathogenic thrombosis is due to dysregulated immunothrombosis.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3150">{{Refimprove|date=December 2015}}The '''iron catastrophe''' was a postulated major geological event early in the [[history of Earth]]. The original [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] of the [[Earth]]'s material into a spherical mass is thought to have resulted in a relatively uniform composition.  While residual heat from the collision of the material that formed the Earth was significant, heating from [[radioactive]] materials in this mass gradually increased the temperature until a critical condition was reached. As material became molten enough to allow movement, the denser [[iron]] and [[nickel]], evenly distributed throughout the mass, began to migrate to the center of the planet to form the core. The gravitational potential energy released by the sinking of the dense [[NiFe]] globules, along with any cooler, denser solid material, is thought to have been a runaway process, increasing the temperature of the protoplanet above the melting point of most components, resulting in the rapid formation of a molten iron core covered by a deep global silicate [[magma]]. This event, an important process of [[planetary differentiation]], occurred at about 500&amp;nbsp;million years into the formation of the planet.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Frankel, 1996, ''Volcanoes of the Solar System,'' Cambridge University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;7–8, {{ISBN|0-521-47770-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of Earth's magnetosphere==
This large spinning mass of super-hot metal is responsible for the creation of the [[Earth's magnetic field]], the [[magnetosphere]], which protects the Earth from [[solar wind]] and the most harmful components of [[solar radiation]] coming from our [[Sun]]. The magnetosphere protects both [[Earth's atmosphere]] and [[life]] to the present day and distinguishes the planet from its close celestial neighbour, [[Mars]], which no longer has a significant magnetic field nor comparable atmosphere.  The term ''catastrophe'' is, here, in the mathematical sense of "a large, sudden change or discontinuity", as contrasted with "a disaster", because this event was necessary for life to emerge and evolve on Earth: without it, Earth's atmosphere would have been, as on Mars, stripped away by solar wind long before the present epoch.

Another theory, however, suggests Mars did once experience its own iron catastrophe and was once shielded by a magnetosphere.  By this theory Mars has simply cooled faster than the Earth, gradually solidifying its dynamic iron center, hence shutting down its magnetosphere. The finding of signs of liquid water once existing on Mars suggests that it once had its own magnetic shield to keep the water in the atmosphere of the planet from being blown into space by solar wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3111_origins.html|title=Origins: Series Overview — NOVA - PBS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ecological restoration of islands''', or '''island restoration''', is the application of the principles of [[ecological restoration]] to [[island]]s and island groups. Islands, due to their isolation, are home to many of the world's [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species, as well as important breeding grounds for [[seabird]]s and some [[marine mammal]]s. Their ecosystems are also very vulnerable to human [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] and particularly to [[introduced species]], due to their small size. Island groups such as [[New Zealand]] and [[Hawaii]] have undergone substantial [[extinction]]s and losses of [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. Since the 1950s several organisations and government agencies around the world have worked to restore islands to their original states; New Zealand has used them to hold natural populations of species that would otherwise be unable to survive in the wild. The principal components of island restoration are the removal of introduced species and the reintroduction of native species.

==Islands, endemism and extinction==
Isolated islands have been known to have greater levels of endemism since the 1970s when the theory of [[Island biogeography]], formulated by  [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[E.O. Wilson]] was developed. This higher occurrence of endemism is because isolation limits immigration of new species to the island, allowing new species to evolve separately from others on the mainland. For example, 71% of [[Biodiversity of New Zealand|New Zealand]]'s bird species (prior to human arrival) were endemic. As well as displaying greater levels of endemism, island species have characteristics that make them particularly vulnerable to human disturbance.

Many island species evolved on small islands, or even restricted habitats on small islands. Small populations are vulnerable to even modest hunting, and restricted habitats are vulnerable to loss or modification of said habitat. More importantly, island species are often ecologically naive, that is they have not evolved alongside a predator, or have lost appropriate behavioural responses to [[predator]]s. This often resulted in flightlessness, or unusual levels of [[island tameness|tameness]]. This made many species susceptible to hunting (it is thought, for example, that [[moa]]s were hunted to extinction in a few short generations) and to predation by introduced species. Some, such as the [[dodo]], are thought to have become extinct because of the pressure of both humans and introduced animals. One estimate of birds in the [[Pacific]] islands puts the extinctions at 2000 species. Between 40 and 50% of the bird species of New Zealand have become extinct since 200 AD.

[[Image:Takahe and chick.jpg|thumb|230px|right|[[Takahe]] have bred after translocation to restored islands, like these on [[Kapiti Island]].]]
The field of island restoration is usually credited with having been started in New Zealand in the 1960s, but other smaller projects, such as the restoration of [[Nonsuch Island]] in [[Bermuda]] (which began in 1962) have been going on for almost as long. Nevertheless, the program undertaken by the [[New Zealand Department of Conservation|Department of Conservation]] (DOC) is one of the largest in the world. It began on [[Cuvier Island]], where ecologists removed stock, [[goat]]s, [[feral cats]] and finally, in 1993, [[Pacific rat]]s. The success of the project resulted in similar projects around New Zealand. The advantages to the DOC were considerable; in addition to protecting species endemic to smaller islands, like the [[magenta petrel]], islands near the mainland, once restored, could act as habitat for species of birds that were unable to survive on the mainland. Species like the [[takahe]], where the remaining wild population was at considerable risk from feral cats and dogs, could be moved to these islands to safeguard the species.

===Eradication of introduced alien species===
One important aspect of island restoration is the removal of [[invasive species|invasive alien species]]. Since these species are most often the reason that native fauna and flora is threatened, their removal is essential to the restoration project. From 1673 until 2009, 786 successful invasive vertebrate eradication have been recorded and in the last few decades the frequency of eradications and the size of islands from which invasive vertebrates have been eradicated has increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Islands Invasive Vertebrate Eradication Database: A tool to improve and facilitate restoration of island ecosystems.|url=http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/people/croll/pdf/Keitt_2011.pdf|publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature|International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)]]|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islands are particularly suitable for restoration as once cleared of an introduced species they can be kept cleared of these species by virtue of being an island. Species removal is intensive and expensive, and methods used must be carefully chosen as to not create too much impact on non-target species. Feral cats, goats and three species of rats are among the most damaging species introduced to islands (Moors &amp; Atkinson 1984). The differences in size, lifestyle and behaviour preclude the use of the same techniques for all of them, but with many species a range of techniques needs to be used in order to ensure success. Larger animals, such as goats and pigs, can be effectively hunted; in the case of [[Round Island (Mauritius)|Round Island]], in [[Mauritius]], all the goats were eliminated by a single marksman. On larger islands ecologists use a [[Judas goat]], where a radio collared goat is released into the wild. This goat is then followed and groups it joins are removed. To remove cats a combination of techniques is needed: hunting, trapping and poisoning. Cats are more difficult to hunt than goats and pigs, requiring the use of experienced hunters and night hunting.

Trapping is ineffective for rats, given their sheer numbers, and the only method that works is [[poison]]ing, which can be delivered into the field by broadcasting (by hand or from the air) or by the maintenance of bait stations. This method has been employed around the world, in the [[Falkland Islands]], in the tropical Pacific, and off New Zealand, where over 40 islands have been cleared. This method is not without problems, especially if the rats share the island with other, native species of rodent that might take the bait as well, as has happened on [[Anacapa Island]] in the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] and Rat Island ([[Hawadax Island|Hawadax]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seabirdrestoration.org/pdf/RatIslandReview.pdf|title=THE RAT ISLAND RAT ERADICATION PROJECT: A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF NONTARGET MORTALITY.

In the Pacific poison intended for rats was taken by land [[crab]]s instead; the crabs were not affected by the poison but frustrated attempts to clear the rats.

The removal of invasive [[weed]]s is, in most cases, more difficult than removing animal species. One such eradication was that of [[sandbur]], ''Cencrus echinatus'', an introduced [[grass]] on [[Laysan]]. The grass, introduced to Laysan around 1961, had taken over 30% of the island by 1991, displaced the native [[bunchgrass]], and reduced the breeding habitat of two endemic threatened species, the [[Laysan duck]] and [[Laysan finch]], as well as those of several [[seabird]]s.  The removal took ten years, with controlled spraying for the first year, then individual removal of plants, then, when few plants were being found, sifting of the sands around plants to remove seeds. The cost of the eradication program was $150,000/year.

====Strategies====

There are three strategies to reduce the numbers of the introduced animals in order to lighten the problems caused by them: exclusion, control, and eradication.
Exclusion is removal of introduced species in limited areas and focused on a local impact.
Control has a meaning of mitigation by reducing the numbers of introduced species down to ecologically and economically less harmful level. Since it is not complete wiping out strategy, this has to be taken constantly and repeatedly. This strategy is said to be feasible but less cost effective due to its incompleteness.
Eradication is the complete removal of all the individuals of the population, down to the last potentially reproducing individual, or the reduction of their population density below sustainable levels&lt;ref&gt;Myers, J. H., Simberloff, D., Kuris, A.  M. &amp; Carey, J. R. (2000). Eradication revisited : dealing with exotic species. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 15, 316–320.&lt;/ref&gt; ( J. H. Myerset al., 2000). For islands, it is usually the best strategy as it gives permanent effects, which potentially means most cost effective. However, it is still logistically and economically high cost. Also, this strategy is sometimes hard to accomplish depending on the environment of island and the alien species.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Courchamp, F., Chapuis, J., and Pascal, M. (2003). Mammal invaders on islands: impact, control and control impact. Cambridge Philosophical Society. 78, 347-383.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methods====

Fencing is used for excluding the alien mammals. This method intends to limit the area for the mammals before control or eradication.
Shooting is often used for large animals to control them. This method has meanings of gaining food supply and recreation. It requires accessibility in the field and experience for the hunters. Also, to maintain the effect, it requires good amount of manpower for long time, so it can be costly.
Trapping is designed for medium-sized mammals which are hard to shoot at.  This method is usually only for reduction not eradication. The advantage of this method is that it can be selective since it is possible to exclude or reduce the possibility of trapping native animals. However, trapping requires limited area to cover and limited population to capture.

Poisoning is very effective for small species. However, there are some disadvantages of this method. It is possible that untargeted animals take the poison. It is also necessary to consider the secondary poisoning that other animals are affected by poisoned species. This method can be costly if the area to cover is large.&lt;ref name=tny20141223&gt;
{{cite news |last1=Kolbert|first1=Elizabeth |title=The Big Kill : New Zealand's crusade to rid itself of mammals |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/22/big-kill |accessdate=23 December 2014 |work=The New Yorker |date=23 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathogen Introduction (parasitism) is one of the biological methods to eradicate alien species. It is very effective for limited species, but the viruses and bacteria need to be specified clearly for use.&lt;ref name=tny20141223/&gt;

Predator introduction is another biological method to eradicate the introduced species. It is less costly and environmentally clean, but it can cause greater problems, because it is possible that the introduced predator targets the native animals instead of alien species and its existence and its parasites can be new problems.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Competitor introduction is also a biological method to eradicate introduced carnivores. It can be very effective with good amount of information. In the end, the competitor has to be removed as well.
Virus vectored immune-contraception is one of the newest method that is to infect introduced animals with genetically engineered viruses. This method is considered environmentally clean, low cost, selective, and ethical. However, it is not fully operational and the effect comes slowly.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Restoration of former habitat===
In many cases the removal of introduced species is sufficient to allow a return to a pre-disturbance state, but generally active management, often in the form of replanting native flora and reintroduction of extirpated fauna is needed to achieve restoration goals. Planting of native species helps to replenish species that were either grazed or out competed. Species of animal can be translocated either from existing populations, or from captive bred populations. These reintroductions need to be carefully managed, particularly in the case of [[endangered species]], where the potential benefits need to be weighed against the possibility of failure. Not all translocations succeed, and it may be necessary to help the reintroduced animals along with supplementary feeding or other kinds of management.

One other important aspect of restoration is prevention, that is, keeping invasive species from returning to a cleared island. This can be achieved by restricting access to the island in question (reducing possible instances of invasion) to more stringent quarantine methods. For example, in order to prevent invasive weeds from returning to Laysan, people working on the island must bring entirely new clothes to the island, which must be frozen prior to arrival.

==Opposition to island restoration==
Prior to the initial efforts to remove rats from New Zealand's offshore islands there was a great deal of skepticism as to the feasibility of island restoration amongst ecologists and conservation workers. However, as the techniques have improved and larger islands have been restored, most of the initial criticisms from within the field have been dropped, in particular as the costs of eradication are often much lower than continuous pest control. Outside of the field of conservation there has been some opposition from other interested groups, particularly from the [[animal rights]] movement, which contends that the [[animal welfare|welfare]] of the pests in question is not adequately addressed in island restoration plans. Because a broad spectrum of pest removal techniques needs to be used, including leg traps, animal rights campaigners accuse ecologists of cruelty, and indifference to non-targeted species that also take bait or are trapped, and suggest that more humane methods such as capture and [[Animal sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] be used instead (something those working in island restoration contend would be too expensive, and potentially ineffective as in [[Kangaroo Island#Conservation|Kangaroo Island]] [[koala]]s.). Some also defend the rights of the introduced species to exist as well.  Others, including scientists affiliated with the animal rights movement, accept that when the choice is between the future of a species and a population of pests, the future of a species must take priority (with the caveat that the extermination is conducted as humanely as possible). Opposition to island restoration has not led to the abandonment of many projects but has delayed several, particularly through court action. Groups sometimes adopt different approaches; opponents of [[hedgehog]] removal in the [[Outer Hebrides]] offered bounties for live hedgehogs removed from the islands and relocated in their natural habitat. Invasive plants can also generate strong feelings. The removal of ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' trees from [[Angel Island (California)|Angel Island]] in [[San Francisco Bay]] faced considerable opposition.

==Island restoration projects==
Island restoration has been attempted in many countries since the 1960s, and has met with varying degrees of success. The following examples highlight some of the factors that influence projects. A comprehensive list of projects can be found on the Database of Island Invasive Species Eradications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DIISE|url=http://diise.islandconservation.org/|publisher=Island Conservation|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Round Island ===
[[Île Ronde, Mauritius|Round Island]] (Île Ronde in French) is a tropical island 22.5 kilometres north of [[Mauritius]], with an area of 1.69 square kilometres and a maximum elevation of 280 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mauritian-wildlife.org/application/index.php?tpid=30&amp;tcid=82|title=Welcome to the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation (MWF) - In The Field - Mauritius - Round Island|last=Foundation|first=Mauritian Wildlife|website=www.mauritian-wildlife.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other [[Mascarene Islands|Mascarene]] islands and islets, Round Island remained relatively pristine until goats and rabbits were introduced in the 19th century (goats were introduced between 1846 and 1868, whilst rabbits were present in large numbers before 1810).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/216936090|title=Lost land of the dodo : an ecological history of Mauritius, Réunion &amp; Rodrigues|last=S.)|first=Cheke, A.

(Julian Pender)|isbn=9780300141863|location=New Haven|oclc=216936090}}&lt;/ref&gt; These herbivores, along with other factors, such as sporadic logging and frequent cyclones, led to the eventual dwindling of the island's forests and dependent fauna. In turn, this led to soil erosion by wind and rain, impeding forest regeneration, acting as a [[Positive feedback|positive feedback mechanism]] that caused rapid deforestation of the island. In 1957, however, Round Island was officially made a nature reserve, and in 1979 and 1986 was rid of goats (shooting) and rabbits (poisoning), respectively, after several unsuccessful attempts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Since removal of the introduced herbivores, the Round Island plant community has recovered dramatically. This is especially stark for three of the endemic tree species, ''Latania loddigesii'', ''Pandanus vandermeerschii'' and ''Hyophorbe lagenicaulis'', which constituted a large portion of the Round Island forest historically. This has led to six reptile species (five of which were [[critically endangered]]) recovering in tandem with the plant community; these are the skinks ''Leiolopisma telfaririi'' and ''Scelotes bojerii'', the geckos ''Phelsuma guentheri'', ''P. ornata'' and ''Nactus serpensinsula'', and the snake C''asarea dussumerii.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1994-01-01|title=Changes in the vegetation and reptile populations on Round Island, Mauritius, following eradication of rabbits|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006320794900043|journal=Biological Conservation|language=en|volume=67|issue=1|pages=21–28|doi=10.1016/0006-3207(94)90004-3|issn=0006-3207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Round Island restoration program represents one of the longest-running projects of its kind in the world, since its conservation status was confirmed in 1957. Much of the current conservation work on Round Island is conducted by the [[Mauritian Wildlife Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mauritian-wildlife.org/application/index.php?tpid=1&amp;tcid=1|title=Welcome to the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation (MWF) - Home|last=Foundation|first=Mauritian Wildlife|website=www.mauritian-wildlife.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.durrell.org/wildlife/|title=Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust {{!}} Home|website=Durrell|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and revolves around maintaining soil levels, reforestation of the island, and eradication of remaining invasive plants and invertebrates. 

===Aleutian Islands===
[[Image:Fox with auklet.jpg|200px|thumb|Arctic fox with [[least auklet]].]]
The [[Aleutian Islands]], prior to the 18th century, lacked any terrestrial predators, but from the mid-18th century [[Arctic fox]]es were introduced to act as a source for the [[fur trade]], a practice that continued into the early 20th century. This introduction decimated the birds of the chain, particularly [[seabird]]s like the [[whiskered auklet]]. The reduction in seabirds, in turn, had effects on the [[ecology]] of the islands, as many of the plants were dependent on the guano from nesting birds acting as a fertilizer. In the early 1950s managers of the Aleutian Islands Reservation became aware of the damage, and an eradication program began. Since then over 80 islands have been cleared of non-native foxes (only six islands remain) and bird populations have rebounded. Whiskered auklets, which numbered 25,000 in 1974, had increased to 116,000 in 2003.

===Campbell Island===
[[Campbell Island, New Zealand|Campbell Island]] is a sub [[Antarctic]] island 700&amp;nbsp;km south of New Zealand that became infested with [[Norway rat|rats]] in the 19th century. Several endemic birds, including the [[Campbell teal]] and [[Campbell snipe]], only survived on small rocky islets just off the island, and the populations were perilously low. Several teals were taken into captivity for [[ex-situ conservation]], but once they had bred in captivity there was no-where else to return them to until the island was cleared of rats. The DOC's plan to remove rats from the island was one of the most ambitious attempted, as the island was so remote, the rat populations had the highest density of rats anywhere in the world, the weather treacherous and, at 113&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it was the largest island at that point where eradication had been attempted. The poison had to be dropped in the winter, to minimize disturbance to nesting seabirds and reduce the chance of [[bird strike]] for the pilots. After several experiments, the eradication began in 2001. In 2003 trackers with dogs were unable to find any rats. Soon after the island was cleared it was possible to return the teals to the island. [[Snipe]] have self-reintroduced to the island and have begun breeding.

=== South Georgia ===
Rats, brought to [[South Georgia Island]] as stowaways on sealing and whaling ships in the late 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sgisland.gs/index.php/%28e%29Eradication_Of_Rodents?useskin=env|title=Eradication of Rodents|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands|access-date=2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150803043220/http://www.sgisland.gs/index.php/(e)Eradication_Of_Rodents?useskin=env|archivedate=2015-08-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have caused much damage to native wildlife, destroying tens of millions of ground-nesting birds’ eggs and chicks.

The '''Kaldenkirchen Sequoia Farm''' ({{lang-de|Sequoiafarm Kaldenkirchen}}) is a German [[arboretum]] that has been used as a biological institute for many years. Part of the [[protected area]] in the city of [[Nettetal]], it is situated in the "[[Kaldenkirchen]] Grenzwald" (forest bordering Germany and the [[Netherlands]]). Nettetal lies in the [[Lower Rhine region (Germany)|Lower Rhine region]] of Germany.

== History and use ==
In 1946, [[Illa Martin]] and Ernst J. Martin, both dentists and [[dendrology|dendrologists]] in Kaldenkirchen, founded an arboretum close to the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] border. There, and in a nearby laboratory-plantation several acres wide from 1952 on, they cultivated 1,500 [[giant sequoia]] (''Sequoiadendron giganteum'') seedlings from seeds of US origin from Martin's nephew Albert A. Martin of Santa Barbara, CA.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Hubatsch: ''Ernst Martin''. In: ''Der Niederrhein''. Krefeld. No. 3, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; The seeds were collected in Sequoia National Forest at different elevations, wrapped in burlap to preserve them and sent to Germany. They wanted to find out if the giant sequoia, which had existed in Germany before the [[ice age]], could be introduced to German [[forestry]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Lange: ''Wissenschaft als Steckenpferd. Laienforscher – ihre Leistungen und ihre Wissenschaft''. Holsten. Hamburg 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernst J. Martin: ''Mammutbäume in der deutschen Forstwirtschaft?'' In: „Die Umschau in Wissenschaft und Technik“. Frankfurt 1954. {{ISSN|0041-6347}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was on the one hand an area of purely giant sequoia, on the other an experimental arboretum with trees such as ''[[Abies grandis]]'', ''[[Abies concolor|Abies concolor var. lowiana]]'' and [[Coast Douglas-fir]]s. The project was financially supported by the [[German Research Foundation]] and met with great interest from dendrological circles, particularly in Great Britain and in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Huth: ''Sequoias in Germany''. In: ''Journal of Forest History'', Vol. 3, July 1976. Durham (USA), {{ISSN|0094-5080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the field exclusively planted with giant sequoia was reserved for obtaining results of productivity by the "Ecology and Forestry Department" of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] (NRW).&lt;ref&gt;Illa Martin: ''Die Wiedereinführung des Mammutbaumes (Sequoiadendron giganteum) in die deutsche Forstwirtschaft''. In: ''Mitteilungen der Deutschen Dendrologischen Gesellschaft''. Vol. 75, pp. 57&amp;ndash;75. Ulmer. Stuttgart 1984. {{ISBN|3-8001-8308-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The two dendrologists made further experiments growing seedlings of [[coast redwood]],&lt;ref&gt;Illa Martin: ''Der Küstenmammutbaum (''Sequoia sempervirens'') und seine Anzucht in Deutschland''. In: ''Mitteilungen der Deutschen Dendrologischen Gesellschaft''. Vol. 77, pp. 57&amp;ndash;104. Ulmer. Stuttgart 1987. {{ISBN|3-8001-8310-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[dawn redwood]] and numerous kinds of [[southern beech]]es&lt;ref&gt;Illa Martin: ''Anzucht und Anbau von Nothofagus in Deutschland''. In: ''Mitteilungen der Deutschen Dendrologischen Gesellschaft''. Vol. 70, pp. 147&amp;ndash;166. Ulmer. Stuttgart 1978. {{ISBN|3-8001-8302-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[pine]] trees. More than 13,000 were handed over to forestry officers, to scientists and to [[plant nursery|plant nurseries]]. As time went by, the park known as the "Sequoia Farm" became bigger and bigger, developing into a highly respected arboretum. It has more than 400 varieties of trees and interesting ground flora and is part of the "Protected area of [[Maas River|Maas]]-[[Schwalm (Meuse)|Schwalm]]-[[Nette (Niers)|Nette]]", so-called after the three rivers that run through the area.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Hubatsch: ''Von der Sequoiafarm zur Biologischen Station''. In: ''Heimatbuch des Kreises Kempen-Krefeld'', Kempen 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Ernst J. Martin in 1967, North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) took over the farm. At first, the teacher-training institute of NRW, later on the [[University of Cologne]], and, between 1987 and 2007, the [[University of Duisburg-Essen]] made it a centre of dendrological studies.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Krause: ''Mammutbaumfarm am Niederrhein wird zum Eldorado für Wissenschaftler der Essener Uni''. In: ''[[Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung|WAZ]]'' vom 30. Juli 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013 the arboretum has been in possession of the registered society "Sequoiafarm e.V.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sequoiafarm-kaldenkirchen.de|title=Ein einzigartiges Arboretum am Niederrhein. - Sequoiafarm Kaldenkirchen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From April to October it is open to the public on Sundays and holidays.

In [[computing]], '''kill pill''' is a term given to mechanisms and technologies designed to render [[Computer systems|systems]] useless either by user command, or under a predefined set of circumstances. Kill pill technology is most commonly used to disable lost or stolen devices for security purposes, but can also be used for the enforcement of rules and contractual obligations.

==Applications==

===Lost and stolen devices===
Kill pill technology is used prominently in [[smartphone]]s, especially in the disablement of lost or stolen devices. A notable example is [[Find My iPhone]], a service that allows the user to [[password]] protect or [[Data erasure|wipe]] their [[iDevice|iDevice(s)]] remotely, aiding in the protection of private data.&lt;ref name=FindMyiPhone&gt;{{cite web|title=iCloud - Find my iPhone|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/icloud/#find|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar applications exist for other smartphone [[Operating System|operating systems]], including [[Android (operating system)|Android]],&lt;ref name=Android5Ways&gt;{{cite web|last=Lightner|first=Rob|title=5 ways to help find your lost Android device|url=http://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-20095637-285/5-ways-to-help-find-your-lost-android-device/|publisher=CNET|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BlackBerry OS|BlackBerry]],&lt;ref name=BlackBerryProtect&gt;{{cite web|title=BlackBerry Protect|url=http://ca.blackberry.com/devices/features/security/protect.html|publisher=BlackBerry Inc.|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Windows Phone]].&lt;ref name=FindingLostMicrosoftPhone&gt;{{cite web|title=Finding a lost phone|url=http://www.windowsphone.com/en-ca/how-to/wp7/basics/find-a-lost-phone|publisher=Microsoft Inc.|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-piracy measure===
Kill pill technology has been notably used as an [[Copy protection#Anti-piracy|anti-piracy]] measure. [[Windows Vista]] was released with the ability to severely limit its own functionality if it was determined that the copy was obtained through [[Software piracy|piracy]]. The feature was later dropped after complaints that [[false positive]]s caused genuine copies of Vista to act as though they were pirated.&lt;ref name=VistaKillPill&gt;{{cite news|title='Kill switch' dropped from Vista|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7126902.stm|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=4 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removal of malicious software===
The concept of a kill pill is also applied to the remote removal by a [[Server (computing)|server]] of malicious files or applications from a [[Client (computing)|client's]] system. Such technology is a standard component of most handheld computing devices, mainly due to their generally more limited operating systems and means of obtaining applications. Such functionality is also reportedly available to applications downloaded from the [[Windows Store]] on [[Windows 8]] operating systems.&lt;ref name=Win8KillSwitch&gt;{{cite news|last=Robertson|first=Jordan|title=The Kill Switch Comes to the PC|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-02-17/the-kill-switch-comes-to-the-pc|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=Businessweek|date=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vehicles===
Kill pill technology is used frequently in [[Motor vehicle|vehicles]] for a variety of reasons. Remote vehicle disablement can be used to prevent a vehicle from starting, to prevent it from moving, and to prevent the vehicle's continued operation. Non-remotely, vehicles can require driver recognition before starting or moving, such as asking for a password or some form of [[biometrics]] from the driver.&lt;ref name=VehicleKillPill&gt;{{cite web|title=Vehicle Disabling Systems|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/facts-research/systems-technology/product-guides/vehicle-disabling.htm|publisher=US Department of Transportation: Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association|accessdate=13 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221084256/http://@fmcsa.dot.gov/facts-research/systems-technology/product-guides/vehicle-disabling.htm|archivedate=21 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kill pill technology is often used by governments to prevent [[drunk driving]] by repeat offenders as a punishment and deterrent. The installation of an [[ignition interlock device]]s is a sentencing alternative for drunk drivers in almost all 50 of the [[United States]]. Such a device requires the driver to blow into a [[breathalyzer]] before starting the vehicle. If the driver is found to be over the legal [[blood alcohol content]] limit, the vehicle will not start&lt;ref name=CarBreathalyzer&gt;{{cite news|last=Cordell|first=LaDoris|title=Baby, You Can't Drive Your Car|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2009/09/baby_you_cant_drive_your_car.html|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=Slate|date=22 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses===
Kill pill technology can also be implemented to contextually disable certain aspects of a smartphone's functionality. A patent obtained by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] claims the ability to disable the antenna, screen, or camera of a smartphone in settings like theaters, schools, and areas of high security sensitivity.&lt;ref name=ApplePatent&gt;{{cite patent|country = US|number = 8254902|status = patent|title = Apparatus and methods for enforcement of policies upon a wireless device}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Kill pill technology has been criticized for allowing for the suppression of personal liberties. While a kill pill can be utilized in a school setting to prevent academic dishonesty, it has been suggested that governments may also use it to suppress their people, for example, by disabling a phone's camera or antenna in the area of a protest.&lt;ref name=ApplePatentProtest&gt;{{cite news|last=Whittaker|first=Zack|title=Apple's patent could remotely disable protesters' phone cameras|url=http://www.zdnet.com/apple-patent-could-remotely-disable-protesters-phone-cameras-7000003640/|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=ZDNet|date=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to remotely remove files and applications from a user's device has also come under fire. Apple's apparent ability to [[blacklist]] applications, rendering them unusable on any iDevice, has raised concerns about the user's rights when downloading from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]].&lt;ref name=AppleRemoteWipe&gt;{{cite news|last=Buchanan|first=Matt|title=Apple Can Remotely Disable Apps Installed on Your iPhone|url=https://gizmodo.com/5034007/apple-can-remotely-disable-apps-installed-on-your-iphone|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=Gizmodo|date=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2014, no applications appear on Apple's blacklist website.

The '''Lee algorithm''' is one possible solution for [[maze router|maze routing problems]] based on [[Breadth-first search]].
It always gives an optimal solution, if one exists, but is slow and requires considerable memory.

==Algorithm==
1) Initialization
  - Select start point, mark with 0
  - i := 0
2) Wave expansion
  - REPEAT
      - Mark all unlabeled neighbors of points marked with i with i+1
      - i := i+1
    UNTIL ((target reached) or (no points can be marked))

[[Image:lee waveprop.png|thumb|Wave Expansion step]]

3) Backtrace
    - go to the target point
    REPEAT
      - go to next node that has a lower mark than the current node
      - add this node to path
    UNTIL (start point reached)
4) Clearance
  - Block the path for future wirings
  - Delete all marks

Of course the wave expansion marks only points in the routable area of the chip, not in the blocks or already wired parts, and to minimize segmentation you should keep in one direction as long as possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1053">'''Macroflora''' is a term used for all the plants occurring in a particular area that are large enough to be seen with the naked eye.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/macroflora Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually [[synonym]]ous with the [[Flora]] and can be contrasted with the [[microflora]], a term used for all the [[Bacterium|bacteria]] and other [[microorganism]]s in an [[ecosystem]].
 
Macroflora is also an informal term used by many [[Paleobotany|palaeobotanists]] to refer to an assemblage of plant [[fossil]]s as preserved in the rock.&lt;ref name="ClealThomas2009"&gt;Cleal, C. J. &amp; Thomas, B. A. (2009).  ''Introduction to plant fossils.''  Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in contrast to the [[flora]], which in this context refers to the assemblage of living plants that were growing in a particular area, whose fragmentary remains became entrapped within the sediment from which the rock was formed and thus became the macroflora.

A '''microapartment''', also known as a '''microflat''', is a one-room, self-contained living space, usually purpose built, designed to accommodate a sitting space, sleeping space, bathroom and [[kitchenette]] with 14–32 square metres (50–350 sq ft) Unlike a traditional [[studio flat]], residents may also have access to a communal kitchen, communal bathroom/shower, [[patio]] and [[roof garden]].

==Characteristics==
[[File:Small_room_-_interior.JPG|thumb|250px|Bedrooms in microapartments need to be tiny and may also serve as a living room.]]
The microapartments are often designed for [[futons]], or with [[Murphy bed|pull-down beds]], folding desks and tables, and extra-small or hidden appliances. They differ from [[bedsit]]s, the traditional British bed-sitting room, in that they are self-contained, with their own bathroom, toilet, and kitchenette.

Microapartments are becoming popular in urban centres in Europe, Japan, Hong Kong and North America, maximizing profits for developers and landlords and providing relatively low-priced accommodation.&lt;ref name=Christie&gt;{{cite news |first=Les |last=Christie |url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/21/real_estate/micro-apartments/index.html |title=Micro-apartments: The anti-McMansions |work=CNN Money |date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lauren |last=O'Neill |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourcommunity/2012/11/san-francisco-approves-220-square-foot-micro-apartments.html |title=Would you live in a 220-square-foot 'micro apartment?' |work=CBC News |date=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Rome]], where the average price of property in 2010 was $7,800 per square metre (10.7 square feet), microapartments as small as 4 square metres (45 square feet) have been advertised.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Day |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/tight-fit-for-romes-microapartments-7447396.html |title=Tight fit for Rome's 'micro-apartments' |work=The Independent |date=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries==
===Hong Kong===
[[Gary Chang (architect)|Gary Chang]], an architect in [[Hong Kong]], has designed a large 32-square-metre (344 sq ft) microapartment with sliding walls attached to tracks on the ceiling. By moving the walls around, and using built-in folding furniture and worktops, he can convert the space into 24 different rooms, including a kitchen, library, laundry room, dining room, bar and video-game room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Virginia |last=Gardiner |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/15/garden/15hongkong.html |title=24 Rooms Tucked Into One |work=The New York Times |date=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hong Kong, developers are embracing the micro-living trend, renting microapartments at sky-high prices. The ''Wall Street Journal'' compares the 180-square-feet flat in High Place, [[Sai Ying Pun]] to the size of a U.S. parking spot (160 square feet) in a video, highlighting the soaring property prices in Hong Kong (one of the apartments in High Place was sold for more than US$500,000 in June 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Steger |first=Isabella |date=2 June 2015 |title=In Hong Kong, the Apartments Are Fit for a Mosquito |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-hong-kong-the-apartments-are-fit-for-a-mosquito-1433237582 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |location=New York City |access-date=21 June 2016 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===USA===
In January 2013, New York City got its first microapartment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= New York City "micro" apartments aim to be cosy, not cramped |first= Jonathan |last= Allen |work= [[Reuters]] |date= 10 July 2012 |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/10/uk-usa-newyork-apartments-idUSLNE86900Z20120710 }}&lt;/ref&gt; building, with 55 units that are as small as {{convert|250|sqft}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Manhattan to Get First 'Micro-Unit' Apartment Building |first= Oshrat |last= Carmiel |date= 22 January 2013 |work= [[Bloomberg News]] |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-22/new-york-city-to-get-first-micro-unit-apartment-building.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ceilings from {{convert|9|to|10|ft|spell=in}}.

Boston's first microapartment building opened in August 2016, at 1047 Commonwealth Avenue in [[Packard's Corner]].  As the largest microapartment building in the United States, the building is currently being leased by Boston University to house 341 students during the renovation of another university residence.  The building contains 180 units that each contain a bathroom with stand-up shower; a kitchen with all stainless-steel appliances that include an oven, a microwave, a dishwasher, and a refrigerator. Each unit also includes a stand up washer-dryer unit. Other amenities include an optional parking garage and indoor bike room in the basement, currently unused retail space, a lounge space, a rooftop penthouse, a deck overlooking the [[Allston]] neighbors, and an entertainment room that will be converted to a fitness center at the end of the University's tenure at the property, which is anticipated to be in 2018.

In the United States, most cities have zoning codes that set the minimum size for a housing unit (often 400 square feet) as well as the number of non-related persons who can live together in one unit. &lt;ref name=Bring_back_boarding_house&gt;{{cite news | last=Badger | first=Emily | title=Is It Time to Bring Back the Boarding House? | url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2013/07/it-time-bring-back-boarding-house/6236/ | access-date=2017-11-13 | publisher=CityLab - The Atlantic Monthly Group | date=2013-07-18 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114022002/https://www.citylab.com/equity/2013/07/it-time-bring-back-boarding-house/6236/ | archive-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a backlash in some cities against the increasing number of microapartments. In [[Seattle]], some residents have complained that [[Urban density|high-density]] microhousing changes the character of neighbourhoods, suddenly increasing demand for parking spaces and other amenities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hickman |first=Matt |url=http://www.mnn.com/your-home/remodeling-design/blogs/micro-apartments-met-with-nimbyist-sentiment-in-seattle |title=Micro-apartments met with NIMBYist sentiment in Seattle |work=Mother Nature Network |date=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lynn |last=Thompson |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2020845443_apodmentscitycouncilxml.html  |title=Critics of micro-apartments calling for a moratorium |work=Seattle Times |date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK===
In the UK, property developers are using office-to-residential permitted development rights, a policy introduced in 2013, to transform old office buildings into microapartment developments. The nationally described space standard stipulates that new homes in the UK cannot be smaller than 37sqm; however, this does not apply to conversions. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rupert |last=Jones |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/feb/11/welcome-rabbit-hutch-britain-land-ever-shrinking-home |title=Welcome to rabbit-hutch Britain, land of the ever-shrinking home |date=11 February 2017 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; London-based developer Inspired Homes has taken advantage of office-to-residential permitted development rights to deliver over 400 microapartments. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Gordon |url=https://www.metro.news/the-micro-apartment-may-be-a-trend-thats-here-to-stay/558705/ |title=The micro apartment may be a trend that’s here to stay |date=4 April 2017 |work=Metro News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A micro-property in the UK has no strict definition but typically refers to properties with a floor area below 37sqm. ''Which?'' magazine reported that almost 8,000 new micro-homes were built in 2016, the highest number on record. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.which.co.uk/news/2017/08/the-30-sqm-squeeze-would-you-buy-a-micro-home/ |title=The 30 sqm squeeze: would you buy a ‘micro-home’? |date=19 August 2017 |last=Calver |first=Tom |work=[[Which?]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2017, the largest microapartment building in the world is The Collective Old Oak,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mairs |first1=Jessica |title=World's largest co-living complex promises residents "everything at their fingertips" |url=https://www.dezeen.com/2016/04/28/collective-old-oak-common-co-living-plp-architecture-willesden-junction-london-housing/ |website=Dezeen |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which opened in London on May 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inside London’s Largest Co-Living Development |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-londons-largest-co-living-development-1478794347 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by [[PLP Architecture]], the development has 546 rooms with most units grouped into "twodios" – two en-suite bedrooms that share a small kitchenette. There are also some private suites. The units sizes range from {{convert|9.2|sqm}} for an ensuite rooms with a {{convert|5.8|sqm}} shared kitchenette, to {{convert|12|sqm}} for a shared ensuite and {{convert|16.5|sqm}} shared ensuite with kitchenette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Co-Living FAQ|url=https://www.thecollective.co.uk/coliving/faq|website=The Collective|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each floor features one larger kitchen with a dining table, which is shared between 30 and 70 residents, and themed communal living spaces such as a games room, a cinema, a 'disco-launderette', a hidden garden and a spa. A restaurant, gym and co-working spaces are located in the lower floors of the building.

===Germany===
In 2017, the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'' reported there are about 25,000 micro-apartments in the country, and several thousand more are set to be built by the end of 2018. The projects will receive state support: the federal government plans to invest €120M in the micro-apartment market expansion. The market of micro-apartment targets over 30 million people, including students, singles and tenants whose primary places of residence are far from the big cities they work in. In Germany, tenants traditionally face considerable obstacles when trying to rent for anything less than the long-term — such as the obligation to pay a security deposit equal to three months’ rent and heightened credit history scrutiny. To the contrary, micro-apartments tend to cater to short- to medium-term renters. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Micro-apartments:the hottest new trend sweeping the German real estate market|url=https://tranio.com/germany/analytics/micro-apartments-the-hottest-new-trend-sweeping-the-german-real-estate-market_5245/|website=Tranio|date=21 December 2016 |first1=Elena |last1=Milishenkova |first2=George |last2=Kachmazov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pros and cons==
Although some prefer to live in microapartments, others only temporarily live in microapartments due to economic reasons, and would move to a larger house or apartment if they could afford to do so.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Susan Saegert, a professor of environmental psychology at the CUNY Graduate Center was quoted with her opinion on microapartments, “I’ve studied children in crowded apartments and low-income housing a lot,” Saegert said, “and they can end up becoming withdrawn, and have trouble studying and concentrating.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/the-health-risks-of-small-apartments/282150/ |title=The Health Risks of Small Apartments |first=Jacoba |last=Urist |date=19 December 2013 |work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The small size of a microapartment can be an issue, as its confined nature may permit strong odors to linger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tempest |first=Jean |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/realestate/what-no-one-ever-tells-you-about-tiny-homes.html |title=What no one ever tells you about tiny homes |work=New York Times |date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35491">'''Migrant sex work''' is the work done by [[migrant worker]]s in [[prostitution]]. Migrant sex work is significant because of its role as a dominant demographic of commercial sex workers internationally. Migrant sex work shares several similarities across various contexts, such as their [[Human migration|migration]] from rural to urban areas or between developing to industrialized nations and the economic push and pull factors that help determine their migrant status. Migrant sex workers have also been at the center of complex discussions over the legality of sex work, the differentiation or conflation of [[sex work]] from [[sex trafficking]], and responses from national governments and [[non-governmental organization]]s over the regulation of sex work and the provision of services for victims of sex trafficking.

==Demographics and background==
The illegal nature of migrant sex work makes it difficult to obtain reliable and conclusive estimates of migrant sex workers.&lt;ref name=AugustinA&gt;Augustin, Laura. 2006. “The Disappearing of a Category: Migrants Who Sell Sex.” ''Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies'' 32(1):29-47.&lt;/ref&gt; However, social scientists have discovered significant trends regarding the identity of migrant sex workers. While migrants who work in agriculture or construction are largely male, migrants who engage in commercial sex work are largely female with ages ranging from the early teens to middle age.&lt;ref name=AugustinB&gt;Agustín, Laura. 2007. ''Sex at the Margins: Migration, Labour Markets and the Rescue Industry.'' London: Zed Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Migrant sex workers make up significant proportions of the sex worker population in many countries, with estimates ranging from 37% in the UK &lt;ref&gt;UK Network of Sex Work Projects. 2008. "Working with  Migrant Sex Workers." Manchester, United Kingdom: UK Network of Sex Work Projects&lt;/ref&gt; to 90% in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;TAMPEP international Foundation. 2009. “Sex Work in Europe.” European Network for HIV/STI Prevention and Health Promotion among Migrant Sex Workers.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brothel price sign for various nationalities on Soy St., HK.JPG|thumb|Brothel price sign for sex workers of various nationalities on Soy Street, Hong Kong]]

Migrant sex workers are diverse in terms of nationality of origin. In certain national contexts, such as in the United Arab Emirates, sex workers come from a diverse range of nations of origin, such as Russia, Nigeria, and Thailand.&lt;ref name=mahdavi&gt;Mahdavi, Pardis. 2011. ''Gridlock: Labor, Migration, and Human Trafficking in Dubai''. Stanford: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; About 60% of sex workers in large Dutch cities, for instance, are women of color from developing nations.&lt;ref name=kempadoo&gt;Kempadoo, Kamala. 2001. “Women of Color and the Global Sex Trade: Transnational Feminist Perspectives.” ''Meridians'' 1(2):28-51.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, what distinguishes migrant sex workers from local sex workers are primarily their low [[socioeconomic status]], primarily illegal immigration status, and poor language skills.&lt;ref name=bernsteinA&gt;Bernstein, Elizabeth. 2007. Temporarily Yours: Intimacy, Authenticity, and the Commerce of Sex. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This results in their frequent marginalization in the unregulated and dangerous sectors of the [[prostitution|sex industry]].&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Julia O'Connell. 2005. ''Children in the Global Sex Trade.'' London: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons for migration and sex work===

====Reasons for migration====
Low economic status and harsh living conditions in migrant sex workers' home country often serve as push factors for migration to more economically advantaged nations. Vast migration between third and first world countries in response to diminishing economic prospects at home has been prevalent since [[economic globalization]] widened the income gap between developed and developing nations.&lt;ref name="EhrenreichHoch"&gt;Ehrenreich, Barbara and Hochschild, Arlie. 2004. Global Woman: Nannies, Maids, and Sex Workers in the New Economy. New York, NY: Holt&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the number of international migrants doubled between 1960 and 2005.&lt;ref name=morrison&gt;Morrison, Andrew R., Maurice Schiff, and Mirja Sjoblom, eds. 2008. The International Migration of Women. ''The World Bank''.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[international migration]] has increasingly become [[Feminization of migration|feminized]], with females making up 50% of all international migrants.&lt;ref name=morrison/&gt;

====Reasons for sex work====
Migrants enter sex work for a variety of reasons. Female migrants largely migrate for jobs in the [[care work|care sector]], such as [[domestic work]], [[childcare]], and [[sex work]], as opposed to males who engage in more physically demanding labor, such as [[construction]] and [[agriculture]].&lt;ref name="EhrenreichHoch"/&gt; Some migrants may have originally intended to work in commercial sex while others found themselves turning to commercial sex after alternate labor means failed or proved to be less lucrative.&lt;ref name=AugustinA/&gt; Others may engage in sex work as a result of situations involving the need to pay off debts incurred during migration or fees to a wide variety of middlemen who may help secure papers, travel passage, and places of work.&lt;ref name=AugustinA/&gt;

For women who engage in rural to urban migration in developing nations with growing [[free trade zones]] and importation of foreign financial capital and [[tourism]], sex work is often more lucrative than alternative forms of labor, such as [[sweatshop|working in manufacturing or in factories]] subcontracting to foreign corporations.&lt;ref name=kempadoo/&gt; Women can choose to engage in commercial sex over these forms of labor, or use sex work to supplement other labor activities, such as domestic work.&lt;ref name=kempadoo/&gt;

==Problems in data and research==
Several scholars have noted the growing number of academic studies, news media coverage, and government and NGO reports on migrant sex workers, victims of sex trafficking, and the overlap between these two groups.&lt;ref name="tyldum"/&gt; As the perception of an international sex trafficking pandemic grows, there have been a large number of attempts to count the number of individuals who engage in some sort of migration and sex work, either voluntarily or coerced.&lt;ref name="tyldum"&gt;Tyldum, Guri and Anette Brunovskis. JH. 2005. "Human Trafficking in East Asia: Current Trends, Data Collection, and Knowledge Gaps." Pp. 165-202 in Data and research on human trafficking: A global survey edited by Laczko, Frank and Gozdziak, Elzbieta. Geneva: International Organization for Migration.&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholars and activists have often criticized the methodologies of these studies and the motivations behind them.

===Conflation of sex work and sex trafficking===
Because prostitution can be an extremely political topic that represents differing political interests, the method of data collection and the use of collected data can vary in reliability.&lt;ref name="tyldum"/&gt; While more pro-sex work academics, organizations, and activists make an explicit demarcation between sex workers and victims of sex trafficking, many other groups consider prostitution to inherently lack a voluntary component. Many anti-sex work activists consider any form of migration for the purpose of commercial sex to be a form of human trafficking.&lt;ref name="doezema"/&gt; As a result, depending on the definition of human trafficking by the organization or data collector, the number of either migrant sex workers or victims of sex trafficking can dramatically change depending on whether or not these two categories of individuals are conflated. Scholars, service providers, and practitioners who attempt to remain apolitical and outside the [[Feminist views on prostitution|feminist views on sex trafficking and sex work]] regarding prostitution still often remark how the legal definitions of human trafficking are still too vague for them to efficiently and neutrally define and count victims.&lt;ref name="tyldum"/&gt; As a result, who is considered to be a migrant sex worker or victim of sex trafficking can widely vary.

===Illegality of sex work===
The illegal nature of either the [[illegal immigration|migration]], [[prostitution law|sex work]], or both components of migrant sex work make it difficult to obtain reliable and conclusive estimates of migrant sex workers.&lt;ref name="AugustinA"/&gt; Scholars Guri Tyldum and Anette Brunovski call sex workers "hidden populations" which they define as "A group of individuals for whom the size and boundaries are unknown,and for whom no sampling frame exists."&lt;ref name="tyldum"/&gt; The reasons why a sampling frame does not exist lies in the illegal and stigmatized nature of sex work. In order to protect their identity from law enforcement and family members, sex workers are often unwilling to participate in studies and surveys that may compromise their privacy and identity.&lt;ref name="tyldum"/&gt;

===Diversity in migrant sex work===
Migrant sex work is also incredibly diverse due to the large number of countries and migration contexts that are involved.&lt;ref name="Brennan"&gt;Brennan, Denise. 2005. “Methodological Challenges in Research with Trafficked Persons: Tales from the Field.” International Migration 43:35-54.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no statistically generalizable portrait of migrant sex workers' day-to-day lives, living and working conditions, and relationships with other sex workers, clients, or third party intermediaries. Studies are unlikely to capture the sheer diversity in migrant sex worker experiences, especially when many of them come from selective samples, such as from a sex worker service provider or even shelter for human trafficking victims.,&lt;ref name="tyldum"/&gt; As a result, many scholars caution against accepting any survey or study of sex workers as generalizable.&lt;ref name="Brennan"/&gt;

==Relationship with human trafficking==
{{See also|human trafficking}}

===Risk of human trafficking===
Because of their illegal and vulnerable economic status, some migrant sex workers may find themselves in situations where coercion and forced sex work may be present. Under international legal definitions of human trafficking, forced and coercive forms of sex work are considered to be instances of involuntary sex trafficking. However, many scholars caution against categorizing sex workers as either completely voluntary or completely involuntary.&lt;ref name="Brennan"/&gt; They often argue that sex work, like other forms of labor, can span a spectrum between the two extremes, with most circumstances falling in the middle through various labor rights violations.&lt;ref name="Brennan"/&gt; Nevertheless, the vulnerability of migrant sex workers can make them susceptible to exploitative or coercive labor practices that can resemble or be human trafficking.

===Conflation with human trafficking===
Whether or not [[human trafficking]] and migrant sex work should be considered the same concept has been a contentious debate among feminist activists, government officials, scholars, and religious organizations for the past 15 years.&lt;ref name=chuang/&gt; This debate currently dominates much of the public discussion surrounding human trafficking and sex work.&lt;ref name=chuang/&gt; On one side of the debate are anti-prostitution activists who [[Feminist views on prostitution|conflate migrant sex work and human trafficking]] because they do not believe in voluntary prostitution or because they view any migration for the purpose of sex work as human trafficking.&lt;ref name="doezema"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chuang"/&gt; This perspective has largely dominated mainstream governmental and NGO perspectives toward human trafficking across international contexts.&lt;ref name="chuang"/&gt;  On the other side of the debate are pro-sex work academics and activists who argue for the separation of voluntary migrant sex work from involuntary human trafficking and a greater focus on labor and migration rights instead of trafficking. This group works for the recognition of the right of prostitutes to pursue sex work as a legitimate form of work, more flexible and open borders for migrants, and a greater focus on the spectrum of coercive labor conditions.&lt;ref name="doezema"&gt;Doezema, Jo. 2002. “Who Gets to Choose?: Coercion, Consent, and the UN Trafficking Protocol.” Gender and Development 10(1):20-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex work and sex trafficking conflation is also a heavily debated legal topic. Several scholars argue that existing legal provisions aimed at combating human trafficking, such as the U.S. Trafficking Victims Protection Act and the 2000 United Nations [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]], do not adequately account for the variety of sex worker conditions and contexts, voluntary or involuntary.&lt;ref name="doezema"/&gt; For instance, Filipina hostesses who migrate to Japan to work as entertainers must give up their legal documents to their recruiters during the migration process.&lt;ref&gt;Parrenas, Rhacel. 2011. Illicit Flirtations. Palo Alto: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While the law considers the process of giving up a passport to a third party intermediary as a condition of human trafficking, several scholars, activists, and the sex workers themselves do not regard this to be human trafficking, particularly when individuals consent to this component of the migration process.

Issues surrounding the definition of [[Feminist views on prostitution|human trafficking in relation to sex work]] and migration situations have contributed to a highly contentious debate and has played a prominent role in structuring how governments have responded to migrant sex workers in terms of viewing them as unwilling victims of a crime or as criminals themselves.&lt;ref name=altman&gt;Altman, Dennis. 2001. ''Global Sex.'' Chicago: The University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==

===Migration and legal status===
Many migrant sex workers migrate illegally or become illegal migrants after leaving previously legal statuses and jobs for sex work.&lt;ref name=AugustinB/&gt; Illegal migrant status can heavily restrict sex worker access to legal alternatives to sex work,  legal sex work venues, and government-provided social services. The consequences are that migrant sex workers are unable to turn to [[law enforcement]] during sexual assaults and rapes or access services available to sex workers with appropriate legal status and citizenship. The possibility of facing deportation and [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigration sentiments]] are critical ways in which migrant sex workers are marginalized.&lt;ref name=AugustinA/&gt; Migrant workers who initially migrate under legal means can become illegal migrants in violation of their visas if they decide to enter sex work.&lt;ref name="mahdavi"/&gt;

Migrant sex workers who have legal status largely do not exist for two reasons. First, governments with legal sex industries typically do not allow foreign nationals to participate legally. New Zealand and Australia are two examples that prohibit foreign individuals with various visa statuses from participating in sex work, making individuals who choose to do so anyway illegal under immigration law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/general/generalinformation/immigrationfraud/ |title=New Zealand Visas|work=immigration.govt.nz|accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Eleanor, 2011, "Industry calls for migrant sex worker visas", ABC News, November 18&lt;/ref&gt; Second, governments that do not have legal sex industries typically allow the entrance of foreign nationals who are currently working as prostitutes or have a history of prostitution.

===Legality of sex work===
{{See also|Prostitution law}}

The legal status of sex work varies in various different national contexts around the world. Scholar Janie Chuang identifies the following four regulatory models for prostitution:&lt;ref name="chuang"/&gt;

[[File:Prostitution laws of the world2.PNG|thumb|right|250px|{{legend|#00ffff|Decriminalization - No criminal penalties for prostitution}}
{{legend|#008000|Legalization -prostitution legal and regulated}}
{{legend|#336699|Abolitionism - prostitution is legal, but organized activities such as brothels and pimping are illegal; prostitution is ''not'' regulated}}
{{legend|#ff7f00|Neo-abolitionism illegal to buy sex and for 3rd party involvement, legal to sell sex}}
{{legend|#FF0000|Prohibitionism - prostitution illegal}}
{{legend|#585858|Legality varies with local laws}}]]

* '''Complete criminalization''': Prohibition of prostitution for all parties (prostitute, clients, and pimps)
* '''Partial criminalization''': Prohibition of prostitution for all parties, except for prostitutes. This is popularly known as the [[prostitution in Sweden|Swedish Model]] which does not criminalize the prostitute, but rather targets the clients and pimps.
* '''Decriminalization''': Does not consider prostitution a crime. Law enforcement is only involved when acts under criminal law occur.
* '''Legalization''': Active regulation of prostitution through licensing, zoning, and mandatory health measures.

Proponents of legalizing prostitution often argue that legalization will provide regulation and benefits to an industry that suffers from negative externalities as a direct result of its illegal status, such as the inability of sex workers to seek legal action towards violent customers or exploitative labor conditions.&lt;ref name=chuang&gt;Chuang, Janie. 2010. "Rescuing Trafficking from Ideological Capture: Prostitution Reform and Anti-Trafficking Law and Policy.” 158 ''University of Pennsylvania Law Review'' 1655.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents for partial criminalization argue that making the act of buying sex, as opposed to selling sex, illegal will eliminate unequal penalties that are traditionally felt by the sex worker, especially when the sex worker is not voluntarily participating in commercial sex.&lt;ref name="chuang"/&gt;

However, legalization of sex work does not mean all sex workers benefit.&lt;ref name="bernsteinA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chuang"/&gt; Even in situations where sex work is decriminalized and legalized, such as in [[Prostitution in Denmark|Denmark]], the migrant sex worker population is often negatively affected. In the [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|Netherlands]], when sex work is legalized, the legal benefits are largely accrued only by sex workers who have legal status or Dutch citizenship.&lt;ref name=bernsteinA/&gt; As a result, the illegal migrant sex worker population that comprises 50%-60% of the overall sex worker population does not have access to licensed and regulated establishments and find themselves pushed into illegal and potentially dangerous sectors of sex work.&lt;ref name=bernsteinA/&gt;

==Responses to migration and sex work==

===Government response===
National governments have responded to migrant sex work similarly to the way they have responded to mass migration.&lt;ref name=altman/&gt; Anti-immigration sentiments have flared in many receiving countries of mass migration, such as the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Schrag, Peter. 2010. ''Not Fit For Our Society''. University of California Press: Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt; and various European countries, such as [[Immigration to France|France]].&lt;ref&gt;World Economic Forum. 2012. "What If Rich Countries Shut the Door on Immigration?" Time, September 20&lt;/ref&gt; Along with these negative sentiments are negative attitudes directed at migrants who engage in sex work, with concerns over sex work's relationship with transnational organized crime, sexually transmitted diseases, and lower moral standards.&lt;ref name=AugustinB/&gt; States have responded by tightening their borders and deporting migrant sex workers.&lt;ref name=altman/&gt;

State response may differ based on anti-human trafficking attitudes that often prevail. Some states are sympathetic to migrant sex workers who are considered to be victims of human trafficking and not voluntary sex workers. Some governments, such as that of the United States, provide legal and health services to individuals who engage in commercial sex if these individuals are proven and officially certified by law enforcement to be victims of human trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;Semple, Kirk. 2012. "Young Immigrants, Seeking Deferred Action Help, Find Unexpected Path." New York Times, March 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sex worker statue Oudekerksplein Amsterdam.jpg|left|thumb|Bronze statue ''Belle'' by Els Rijerse in [[De Wallen]], the largest and best known [[red-light district]] in [[Amsterdam]]. Inscription says "Respect sex workers all over the world."]]

===NGO response===
Response from [[non-governmental organizations]] have largely been centered on anti-trafficking activism and service provision that may also include migrant sex workers. Much of NGO response to migrant sex work has been on increasing awareness of human trafficking problems. Anti-trafficking NGOs have played a role in providing health services and contraceptives.&lt;ref name=AugustinB/&gt; Sex worker outreach organizations also exist in the areas of public and global health.&lt;ref name=chuang/&gt; NGOs also largely target migrant sex workers for their high risk of attracting and passing on sexually transmitted diseases. They offer services such as providing contraception in the form of condoms, engaging sex workers in educational classes concerning sexual and other forms of physical health, and providing HIV and other STD testing.&lt;ref name=AugustinB/&gt;

In some contexts, such as the United States, NGOs have played a role in [[t visa|facilitating illegal migrant access to legal status]] and eventually permanent residency or citizenship. However, these legal benefits are often only available for individuals who can prove their involvement in commercial sex work was involuntary and a form of human trafficking victimhood. On the other hand, some NGO-run campaigns encourage migrant sex workers to return to their nations of origin.&lt;ref name=AugustinB/&gt;

The existence of anti-human trafficking NGOs has also been spurred by the United States [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]]' Trafficking In Persons Report.&lt;ref name=mahdavi/&gt; A prominent component of the TIP Report ranking of countries's response to human trafficking is their involvement and encouragement of civil society and non-governmental efforts at combating human trafficking.&lt;ref name=TIP/&gt;

====Open Society Foundation-funded sexual exploitation advocates====
{{See also|Sex workers' rights}}

There have also been organizations that explicitly support the existence and rights of migrant sex workers,&lt;ref name=doezema/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kempadoo, Kamala. 1998. "Globalizing Sex Workers' Rights." ''Canadian Woman Studies'' 22:143-150.&lt;/ref&gt; many of which are sex worker activist groups themselves. These groups primarily argue for the [[Sex workers' rights|recognition of sex work as a legitimate form of work]] or for the rights and legal status of migrant workers to exist.&lt;ref name=mahdavi/&gt; Many of these NGOs argue for more open border and security policies that would not harm migrant sex workers and the risks that accompany illegal status. Such groups include the [http://www.nswp.org/ New Sex Worker Project], [http://www.iusw.org/ International Union of Sex Workers], and [http://www.sexworkeurope.org/ The International Committee on the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe].

===United States influence on responses to migrant sex work===

====Trafficking in Persons Report====
{{See also|Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons}}

The United States Department of State exerts significant influence on the migration and human trafficking policies of foreign government through the [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]]. The [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] releases an annual Trafficking In Persons Report that rates all countries based on their response and action regarding human trafficking within and between their borders.&lt;ref name=TIP&gt;Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons. 2012. "Trafficking in Persons Report." U.S. Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt; Their ratings are based on whether or not a government is deemed compliant with U.S. minimum standards for response to human trafficking, which are articulated in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. According to the U.S. Department of State, countries are rated on the following standards&lt;ref name="tip report"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2012/192363.htm|title=Tier Placements|work=state.gov|accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Tier 1''' Countries whose governments fully comply with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act’s (TVPA) minimum standards.
* '''Tier 2''' Countries whose governments do not fully comply with the TVPA’s minimum standards, but are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with those standards.
* '''Tier 2 Watchlist''' Countries whose governments do not fully comply with the TVPA’s minimum standards, but are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with those standards
* '''Tier 3''' Countries whose governments do not fully comply with the minimum standards and are not making significant efforts to do so. A Tier 3 ranking can result in significant sanctions from the U.S. government, such as opposition to assistance from international financial assistance institutions and the withdrawal of non-humanitarian aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2011/164221.htm|title=Tiers: Placement, Guide, and Penalties for Tier 3 Countries|work=state.gov|accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the [[U.S. Department of State]] understanding and discussion of human trafficking involves the international flow of migration. According to the Department of State, "Although not all trafficking involves migration, and not all migration is human trafficking, the vulnerabilities of migrants make them a tempting target for traffickers."&lt;ref name="tip report"/&gt; Countries' responses towards migrant workers' conditions of vulnerability therefore play a pivotal role in their Trafficking in Persons Report ranking.

National governments respond to Tier 3 and Tier 2 Watchlist rankings and the potential consequence of sanctions in a variety of ways. These responses also differ in their effects on migrant sex workers. Many countries respond by placing more restrictive immigration standards or greater migration regulations, all for the purpose of seemingly improving state response to human trafficking risks that may accompany open borders.&lt;ref name=mahdavi/&gt; However, the effects of these new regulations have been mixed when it comes to the actual well-being of migrant sex workers. For example, South Korea, after their Tier 3 ranking in the 2001 TIP, launched an in-depth national survey to examine the conditions of their foreign sex workers. At the head of this new effort, however, was a government minister who had previously sough to abolish prostitution. The result was a national law that outlawed the role of third-party migration intermediaries who played an important role in facilitating the migration process of women into South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, June JH. 2005. "Human Trafficking in East Asia: Current Trends, Data Collection, and Knowledge Gaps." Pp 165-202 in ''Data and research on human trafficking: A global survey'' edited by Laczko, Frank and Gozdziak, Elzbieta. Geneva: International Organization for Migration.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anti-Prostitution Pledge====
{{See also|Anti-prostitution pledge}}

In 2003, Congress under the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] announced the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR), a commitment of $15 billion over five years (2003–2008) from United States to internationally fight the [[HIV/AIDS]]. In an effort to combat human trafficking and the supposed role of sex trafficking in spreading HIV/AIDS, the legislation explicitly opposes any efforts that do not conflate prostitution and sex trafficking:&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ025.108.pdf US Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003 HR 1298]. 22 U.S.C. §§ 7601-7682. 108th Congress. Retrieved 21 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

* "No funds [...] may be used to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking."
* "No funds [...] may be used to provide assistance to any group or organization that does not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking."
* nothing in the anti-prostitution clause "shall be construed to preclude" services to prostitutes, including testing, care and prevention services, including condoms.

Within PEPFAR lies the controversial [[anti-prostitution pledge]], a pledge NGOs and governments, with few exceptions, must sign declaring their opposition to prostitution or service provision to prostitutes. This pledge has been heavily criticized by NGOs working to fight HIV/AIDS, sex worker rights activists and organizations, and even national governments who feel a declaration of opposition towards prostitution would be counterproductive to eliminating HIV/AIDS among a vulnerable population.&lt;ref name=chuang/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Michael M. 2005. "Brazil Refuses U.S. AIDS Funds, Rejects Conditions" in ''The Wall Street Journal'' May 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This pledge and its requirement of opposition to prostitution has affected the funding of many organizations working explicitly with migrant sex workers by eliminating many of their social services and increasing their risk of abuse and limited mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Busza, Joanna. 2006. "Having the rug pulled from under your feet: one project’s experience of the US policy reversal on sex work."''Health Policy Plan'' 21(4): 329-332.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==

===The Netherlands and Sweden===
[[File:Prostitution Info Centre.jpg|thumb|left|Prostitution Info Center in [[Amsterdam]] ]]

Countries within the European Union have varied legal statuses for prostitution and sex work. Two European nations have served as representative examples of the two popularly debated legal responses to prostitution: [[Prostitution in Sweden|Sweden's]] model of criminalizing the purchase of sex, but not the act of selling it; and the [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|Netherlands']] model of legalizing and regulating sex work.&lt;ref name="chuang"/&gt; Many pro-sex work advocates argue that the Dutch model of legalization and regulation is the most beneficial for the labor standards and working conditions of sex workers, while many anti-sex work and anti-sex trafficking activists argue that the Swedish Model helps eliminate unfair criminalization of prostitutes instead of the janes, johns and pimps who exploit them.&lt;ref name="chuang"/&gt; Criminalizing clients and pimps additionally avoids prosecuting prostitutes who are in reality victims of human trafficking.&lt;ref name="chuang"/&gt;

However, many scholars argue that neither of these models have had dramatically different results in the status of sex workers or trafficking victims.&lt;ref name="bernsteinA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chuang"/&gt; Rather, both models have only deepened the dangers of sex work for vulnerable groups that engage in sex work, primarily socioeconomically disadvantaged migrant workers.&lt;ref name=bernsteinA/&gt;&lt;ref name=chuang/&gt; Criminalization of buyers of sex work has created more dangerous situations for individuals who continue to engage in commercial sex. Often, they can no longer conduct transactions in public spaces because their clients fear arrest and legal action. As a result, sex work is less susceptible to outreach, and migrants who fear legal repercussions themselves for their legal statuses are unwilling to be involved in situations that may involve law enforcement or service provision.&lt;ref name=chuang/&gt;

Under the Dutch Model, these legal benefits and reduction of risk are not available to migrant sex workers who are largely illegal.&lt;ref name=bernsteinA/&gt; Regulated and legalized sex work requires the registration of brothels, mandated health testing for sex workers, and various other regulations for indoor working spaces and the procurement of clients. As a result, illegal migrant workers who fear deportment over their legal status cannot participate in the formal paperwork associated with legal sex work. They continue to become marginalized from more privileged sex workers.

===Dubai, United Arab Emirates===
{{See also|Prostitution in the United Arab Emirates}}

The [[United Arab Emirates]]'s geographic location makes it an important stepping stone for migrants from the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], [[Eastern Europe]], and [[Southeast Asia]] who wish to eventually work in Europe or the United States.&lt;ref name=mahdavi/&gt; The UAE's economic boom and aggressive development in the early to mid 2000s made it not only attractive to foreign migrants, but also dependent on them. In Dubai, migrants make up almost 90% of the population.&lt;ref name=mahdavi/&gt; While this migrant population is very diverse in terms of nation of origin, the population is divided into mainly two key demographics: poor, vulnerable laborers who come to Dubai through restrictive labor contacts; and rich, Western businessmen and financiers. Both populations contribute to Dubai and the greater UAE in very different yet very important ways. While the more privileged Western migrants contribute financial capital to the development of the city, the poor migrants contribute much of the physical labor necessary to build the city's physical structures.&lt;ref name=mahdavi/&gt;

Along with demand for migrant laborers was also the demand for migrant sex workers. Because of the diversity in the demographics of individuals who live and work in [[Dubai]], a highly diverse and stratified commercial sex industry also exists to cater to these diversities in background, income, and class.&lt;ref name=mahdavi/&gt; For example, the spectrum of sex worker diversity ranges from migrants from Nigeria, Iran, Philippines, and Russia, with their skin tone corresponding to the price they command and the male clientele they see: the lighter the sex worker's skin color, the more Western the clientele and the higher the price. As a result, the UAE's migrant sex worker population is highly diverse and burgeoning. However, because the UAE is a Muslim country without legal prostitution, these sex workers remain largely underground, illegal, and in constant fear of law enforcement intervention and the possibility of deportation.

Because of the UAE's large migrant worker population, restrictive labor contracts, and lack of anti-trafficking partnerships with NGOs, the United States Department of State [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons|Trafficking In Persons Report]] gave UAE a series of Tier 3 and Tier 2 Watchlist rankings.&lt;ref name=mahdavi/&gt; As a result, the UAE allowed more local and international NGO presence to develop, including those working to end human trafficking and sex trafficking.&lt;ref name=mahdavi/&gt;

The '''Norbert Wiener Center for Harmonic Analysis and Applications''' (NWC) is a division of the Mathematics Department in the [[University of Maryland]] College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences devoted to research and education in pure and applied [[harmonic analysis]]. The center, named after acclaimed scientist [[Norbert Wiener]] was founded in 2004 and is based out of the Mathematics Building on the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] campus. It is supported by the University of Maryland, the [[National Science Foundation]], and local industries with which it interacts.

Currently, the Norbert Wiener Center is actively involved in research project involved with waveform design, dimension reduction, geospatial terrain and image processing, data fusion, phase retrieval frames, and analysis on graphs.

==February Fourier Talks==
The Norbert Wiener Center hosts the annual conference, the February Fourier Talks (FFT).  The first FFT was held in 2002 and 2003, and then annually since 2006.  The aim of the annual FFT is to bring together researchers from academia, government, and industry, as a means to spur innovation and foster interaction in Harmonic Analysis and its Applications.  The FFT lasts two days and consists of approximately 15 half-hour talks, a distinguished lecture, a colloquium, and a keynote lecture.  The speakers are top researchers in pure and applied harmonic analysis in academia, government, and industry.

==Current Personnel==

The Director of the NWC is [[John Benedetto]].  The faculty members include: John Benedetto, Radu Balan, Wojciech Czaja, and Kasso Okoudjou.  The current Scientific Development Officers include Michael Dellomo, Jeffrey Sieracki, and Alfredo Nava-Tudela.  The current postdoctoral fellows include Xuemei Chen and Benjamin Manning.  The associate director of the center is Matthew Begué.  A list of all other members, including all graduate students, can be found on the center's official website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4457">The '''Nuker Team''' was formed to use the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], with its high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, to investigate the central structure and dynamics of galaxies.  The team used the [[Hubble Space Telescope|HST]] to examine [[supermassive black hole]]s and determined the relationship between a galaxy's central black hole's mass and velocity dispersion.&lt;ref name=Lauer&gt;{{cite web | author=Tod Lauer | title=HST Investigations Into the Central Structure of Galaxies | url=http://www.noao.edu/noao/staff/lauer/nuker.html | publisher=National Optical Astronomy Observatory | date=14 August 2007 | accessdate=2008-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gebhardt | first=Karl |display-authors=etal  | title=A Relationship between Nuclear Black Hole Mass and Galaxy Velocity Dispersion | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=539 | issue=1 | pages=L13–L16 | doi=10.1086/312840 |date=August 2000 | bibcode=2000ApJ...539L..13G|arxiv = astro-ph/0006289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The team continues to conduct research and publish papers on the supermassive black holes of galaxies and clusters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noao.edu/noao/staff/lauer/nuker_papers.html Nuker Team Refereed Publications].&lt;/ref&gt; The group was initially formed by [[Tod R. Lauer]], then a first year postdoc. At the first meeting of the group held at [[Princeton University]] in June 1985, [[Sandra Faber]] was elected the group leader.

==Members==

The original members of the Nuker Team include [[Alan Dressler]] (OCIW), [[Sandra M. Faber|Sandra Faber]] (UCO/Lick; First PI), [[John Kormendy]] (Texas), [[Tod R. Lauer]] (NOAO), [[Douglas Richstone]] (Michigan; Present PI),  and [[Scott Tremaine]] (IAS).  Later additions to the team include [[Ralf Bender]] (Munchen), [[Alexei Filippenko|Alexei V. Filippenko]] (Berkeley), [[Karl Gebhardt (astronomer)|Karl Gebhardt]] (Texas), [[Richard Green (astronomer)|Richard Green]] (LBTO), [[Kayhan Gultekin]] (Michigan), [[Luis C. Ho]] (OCIW), [[John Magorrian]] (Oxford), [[Jason Pinkney]] (Ohio Northern), and [[Christos Siopis]] (Michigan).&lt;ref name=Lauer /&gt;

==Etymology==

The name "Nuker" began as an informal internal reference by members of the team to each other, because they came together to study the nuclei of galaxies using the space telescope.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, S. Alan, ''Our Universe:  The Thrill of Extragalactic Exploration As Told by Leading Experts'', Cambridge University Press, 2001 {{ISBN|0-521-78330-5}} and {{ISBN|0-521-78907-9}}.  At page 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first use of the name was in a 1989 email from [[Sandra M. Faber|Faber]], who addressed her five colleagues as "Dear Nukers".&lt;ref&gt;Email from Faber to team members, sent Jule 13, 1989, which begins, "Dear Nukers:  We got some time on our ST proposal for nuclei . . . ."&lt;/ref&gt;  As the team began to publish its research, the name came into general use in the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;Alan, ''supra'', at page 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Nuker" is also used in reference to the "[[Nuker law|Nuker Law]]", which is a description of the inner few (~3-10) arcseconds of predominantly nearby (&lt; 30 Mpc) early-type galaxy light-profiles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1995AJ%2E%2E%2E%2E110%2E2622L The Centers of Early-Type Galaxies with HST.I.An Observational Survey]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Nuker Law was described first by members of the Nuker Team, from which it gets its name.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''organon model''', formulated by [[Karl Bühler]], defined the functions of communication according to which linguistic communication can be described. Bühler's work influenced [[Roman Jakobson]] for his [[Jakobson's functions of language|communication model]].

Bühler identified the following three communicative functions:
* the ''expressive function'' (''Ausdrucksfunktion'')
* the ''representation function'' (''Darstellungsfunktion'')
* the ''conative function'' (''Appellfunktion'', i.e. appealing function).

'''Parliamentary informatics''' is the application of information technology to the documentation of legislative activity. The principal areas of concern are the provision, in a form conveniently readable to humans or machines, of information and statistics about:

* individual legislators
* particular legislative proposals
* votes thereon
* text of legislation

Parliamentary informatics is carried on both by officials of legislatures and by private for-profit and non-profit actors, with motivations ranging from the administration of parliaments to lobbying and facilitating democratic discourse.

The division of activities between official and unofficial activity differs widely between polities, even within a single country. There exists substantial overlap with disciplines such as [[psephology]] and, as far as the text of successfully enacted legislation is concerned, [[legal informatics]] in general.

The use of parliamentary informatics is also a rapidly growing trend in parliamentary monitoring. In a September 2011, joint report from the [[National Democratic Institute]] and [[World Bank Institute]], a survey of parliamentary monitoring organisations (PMOs) found that parliamentary informatics are used by approximately 40 percent of PMOs worldwide. The report states, "These tools can automatically aggregate and organize information from parliamentary websites and other information sources, generate visualizations (such as political finance maps), and create new platforms for citizens to interact with MPs or participate in parliamentary monitoring and policy analysis."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndi.org/files/governance-parliamentary-monitoring-organizations-survey-september-2011.pdf] ''Strengthening Parliamentary Accountability, Citizen Engagement and Access to Information: A Global Survey of Parliamentary Monitoring Organizations'', National Democratic Institute and World Bank Institute. Accessed 14 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==

Access to parliamentary information is the most significant issue in parliamentary informatics; access may be inhibited technologically through the provision of parliamentary information in a form not amenable to processing by machines, or legally, by copyright or other protection of the parliamentary record.

Ultimately, it may be possible to provide citizens with a comprehensive overview of all the legislation going through parliaments everywhere in the world, which would allow the tracking of the implementation of international treaties and of general legislative trends.

In a September 2011 report from the [[National Democratic Institute]] and [[World Bank Institute]] on parliamentary monitoring organisations, open data is cited as a fundamental issue for further development. The report explains, "While they have proven effective in many instances, the most useful informatics tools require the availability of parliamentary data in machine-readable or "open data" formats, which remains a challenge in many contexts."&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Albania ===
Une Votoj (in English, "I vote") is a website that provides information about the Parliament of [[Albania]]. The site structures Parliamentary plenary and committee sessions and agendas, and summaries of the proceedings. It also provides biographical notes about elected members, attendance and voting records. It was established in 2005, and is presently run by [[Mjaft!]], an Albanian non-governmental civil society movement.

=== Australia ===
OpenAustralia.org is a community-funded site which was launched in June 2008 and automatically collects and publishes in an easy-to-read format the transcripts of all [[Australian Government]] House of Representatives and Senate debates, questions, discussions and notices. OpenAustralia.org also made available the Register of Senators' and Members' Interests online for the first time ever in Australia. The site was developed in Australia by the [[OpenAustralia Foundation]], adapted from the UK site [[TheyWorkForYou]] built by [[mySociety]]. The site allows comment and discussion against debates and allows users to track the level of participation of Member of the House in debates, including statistics on their appearances in the House – so citizens can keep track of their representatives and be fully informed and involved with their Member's performance in the House. Within weeks of being launched OpenAustralia attracted a lot of attention and positive feedback from both the public and government and is set to pave the way for closer working relationships between government and citizens.

The OpenAustralia Foundation also produces [https://theyvoteforyou.org.au They Vote For You], a website which tracks how every MP voted on every division in the [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]].

[http://vicvote.review Victorian Parliament Tracker] is a similar project for the [[Parliament of Victoria|Victorian Parliament]].

=== Austria ===
The [[National Council of Austria]] is covered by meinparlament.at. The website was modelled after a [[Parliamentary informatics#Germany|German partner website]].

=== Africa ===
"Africa i-Parliaments" is the portal of the regional initiatives of the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] (UNDESA) aimed at strengthening the role of African Parliaments in fostering democracy and good governance by developing common information services and tools, and building information management capabilities with the objective of making Parliaments i-nterconnected, i-nformed i-ndependent, or in short, i-Parliaments.
 
The project includes two main initiatives:

Akoma Ntoso (Architecture for Knowledge-Oriented Management of African Normative Texts using Open Standards and Ontologies) proposes an XML document schema providing sophisticated description possibilities for several Parliamentary document types (including bills, acts and parliamentary records, etc.). It aims to standardise simple, technology-neutral representations of Parliamentary Documents to improve inter-Parliamentary co-operation and reduce the costs of Parliamentary IT support systems. Akoma Ntoso defines a set of recommendations and guidelines for e-Parliament services in a Pan-African context and provides an enabling framework for the effective exchange of machine readable Parliamentary Documents such as legislation, debate record, minutes, etc. The work will provide the basis for the [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] [[Legal XML]] LegalDocumentML project.&lt;ref name=oasis-akoma-ntoso/&gt;

Bungeni – Parliamentary Information System is an end-to-end suite of applications that provides a world-leading solution for drafting, managing, consolidating and publishing legislative and other parliamentary documents. Bungeni aims to increase the efficiency of parliamentary activities and make Parliaments more open and accessible to citizens—virtually allowing them "inside the Parliament" or Bungeni, the Kiswahili word for "inside the Parliament".

=== Belgium ===
[http://www.WeCitizens.be WeCitizens] develops transparency tools for politics: [http://vote.wecitizens.be vote advice applications], a [http://directory.wecitizens.be Political Database], etc.

Government People automatic aggregator of all Russian officials blogs. It includes ratings of persons, monitors activity by region and person competences and provides public API for reuse.

Project Duma 2.0 is a social initiative aimed to improve the laws and to find in Internet effective ways of solving problems. The aim of the project is not simply to inform officials about the citizens' decisions and initiatives, but lobbying of these ideas at the legislative level with the maximum of their application. Duma 2.0 – the first project in Russia, which was created in the global world trend called Citizen 2.0.

OpenGovData.ru – a non-profit project dedicated to the availability of information disclosed by the state for its citizens.

=== Romania ===
The Institutul pentru Politici Publice has created a web site with lots of structured data about the Romanian Parliament.  Adrian Moraru, deputy director with IPP said in an interview with [[mySociety]] explains how they have had to obtain much of their Parliamentary data by court action. The site was first launched in 2006 and redesigned in 2010.

Median Research Centre launched Parlament Transparent in November 2014. This is a parliamentary monitoring tool focused on the Romanian Chamber of Deputies and organised around four dimensions: Members of the Chamber and their work, Public Policy domains, Parliamentary Party Groups (PPGs) and Data Export. 
The application tracks the policy specialisation and the engagement in local interest representation of each MP and enables users to compare the activity of their representatives (one-to-one and one-to-all).  
Moreover, Parlament Transparent allows specialised NGOs and ordinary citizens to keep track of the latest legislative developments in 15 policy areas. Other important features are automatically 
tracking laws adopted without debate or vote and reporting all cases of party switching.

=== United Kingdom ===
The situation in the United Kingdom is very active, with several of the major volunteer projects run by [[mySociety]].  The official UK Parliament website provides transcripts of the Parliamentary debates and votes in plain text form, and these are parsed by a project known as parlparse into a timeline of publicly available structured XML files.  These files provide the data for [[TheyWorkForYou]], which hosts the speeches in a user friendly form and creates email alerts and rss feeds, and [[Public Whip]], which keeps track of the votes and allows for an expression of their meanings in plain English.

Independently of this, the academic [[Philip Cowley]] at [[University of Nottingham|Nottingham University]] researches specifically into how MPs vote through his Revolts website and publications.

The effect of POPs on human and environmental health was discussed, with intention to eliminate or severely restrict their production, by the international community at the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]] in 2001.

Many POPs are currently or were in the past used as [[pesticide]]s, [[solvent]]s, [[pharmaceutical]]s, and industrial chemicals.&lt;ref name="ritter"/&gt; Although some POPs arise naturally, for example volcanoes and various biosynthetic pathways, most are man-made&lt;ref name="El-Shahawi, M.S. 2010"&gt;El-Shahawi, M.S., Hamza, A., Bashammakhb, A.S., Al-Saggaf, W.T. (2010). An overview on the accumulation, distribution, transformations, toxicity and analytical methods for the monitoring of persistent organic pollutants. Talanta. 80, 1587–1597. {{doi|10.1016/j.talanta.2009.09.055}}.&lt;/ref&gt; via [[total synthesis]].

==Consequences of persistence==
POPs typically are halogenated organic compounds (see lists below) and as such exhibit high [[Lipophilicity|lipid solubility]].  For this reason, they [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] in [[Adipose tissue|fatty tissues]]. [[Halogenated]] compounds also exhibit great [[Chemical stability|stability]] reflecting the nonreactivity of C-Cl bonds toward [[hydrolysis]] and [[Photodissociation|photolytic degradation]].  The stability and lipophilicity of organic compounds often correlates with their halogen content, thus polyhalogenated organic compounds are of particular concern.  They exert their negative effects on the environment through two processes, long range transport, which allows them to travel far from their source, and bioaccumulation, which reconcentrates these chemical compounds to potentially dangerous levels.&lt;ref name="Walker, C.H. 2001"&gt;Walker, C.H., "Organic Pollutants: An Ecotoxicological Perspective" (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Compounds that make up POPs are also classed as [[Persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances|PBTs]] ('''P'''ersistent, '''B'''ioaccumulative and '''T'''oxic) or TOMPs ('''T'''oxic '''O'''rganic '''M'''icro '''P'''ollutants).

=== Long-range transport ===
POPs enter the [[gas]] phase under certain environmental temperatures and [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatize]] from [[soil]]s, [[vegetation]], and [[bodies of water]] into the [[atmosphere]], resisting breakdown reactions in the air, to travel long distances before being re-deposited.&lt;ref name="Kelly, B.C. 2007"&gt;Kelly, B.C., Ikonomou, M.G., Blair, J.D., Morin, A.E., Gobas, F.A.P.C. (2007). Food Web-Specific Biomagnification of Persistent Organic Pollutants. ''Science''. 317, 236–239. {{doi|10.1126/science.1138275}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This results in accumulation of POPs in areas far from where they were used or emitted, specifically environments where POPs have never been introduced such as [[Antarctica]], and the [[Arctic circle]].&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, A., Mackay, D., Matthies, M., Wania, F., Webster, E. (2000). Assessing Long-Range Transport Potential of Persistent Organic Pollutants. Environmental Sciences &amp; Technology. 34(4), 699–703. {{doi|10.1021/es990207w}}.&lt;/ref&gt; POPs can be present as vapors in the atmosphere or bound to the surface of solid particles. POPs have low solubility in water but are easily captured by solid particles, and are soluble in organic fluids ([[oil]]s, [[fat]]s, and [[liquid fuel]]s). POPs are not easily degraded in the environment due to their stability and low [[Chemical decomposition|decomposition]] rates. Due to this capacity for long-range transport, POP environmental contamination is extensive, even in areas where POPs have never been used, and will remain in these environments years after restrictions implemented due to their resistance to degradation.&lt;ref name="Wania, F. 1996"&gt;Wania, F., [[Donald Mackay (scientist)|Mackay, D.]] (1996). Tracking the Distribution of Persistent Organic Pollutants. Environmental Science &amp; Technology. 30 (9), 390A–396A. {{doi|10.1021/es962399q}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Astoviza|first=Malena J.|title=Evaluación de la distribución de contaminantes orgánicos persistentes (COPs) en aire en la zona de la cuenca del Plata mediante muestreadores pasivos artificiales|date=15 April 2014|pages=160|language=Spanish|url=http://sedici.unlp.edu.ar/handle/10915/34729|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bioaccumulation ===
[[Bioaccumulation]] of POPs is typically associated with the compounds high lipid solubility and ability to accumulate in the [[adipose tissue|fatty tissues]] of living organisms for long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Wania, F. 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vallack, H.W. 1998"&gt;Vallack, H.W., Bakker, D.J., Brandt, I., Broström-Ludén, E., Brouwer, A., Bull, K.R., Gough, C., Guardans, R., Holoubek, I., Jansson, B., Koch, R., Kuylenstierna, J., Lecloux, A., Mackay, D., McCutcheon, P., Mocarelli, P., Taalman, R.D.F. (1998). Controlling persistent organic pollutants – what next? Environmental Toxicology and Pharmacology 6, 143–175. {{doi|10.1016/S1382-6689(98)00036-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Persistent chemicals tend to have higher concentrations and are eliminated more slowly. Dietary accumulation or [[bioaccumulation]] is another hallmark characteristic of POPs, as POPs move up the food chain, they increase in concentration as they are processed and metabolized in certain tissues of organisms. The natural capacity for animals [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] concentrate ingested chemicals, along with poorly [[Metabolism|metabolized]] and [[hydrophobic]] nature of POPs makes such compounds highly susceptible to [[bioaccumulation]].&lt;ref&gt;Yu, G.W.,, Laseter, J., Mylander, C. Persistent organic pollutants in serum and several different fat compartments in humans. J Environ Public Health. 2011;2011:417980. {{doi|10.1155/2011/417980}}. {{PMID|21647350}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus POPs not only persist in the environment, but also as they are taken in by animals they bioaccumulate, increasing their concentration and toxicity in the environment.&lt;ref name="Kelly, B.C. 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lohmanna, R., Breivikb, K., Dachsd, J., Muire, D. (2007). Global fate of POPs: Current and future research directions. 150, 150–165. {{doi|10.1016/j.envpol.2007.06.051}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants ==
[[File:Map of Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.svg|thumb|275px|State parties to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]]
{{Main|Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants}}

The Stockholm Convention was adopted and put into practice by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) on May 22, 2001. The UNEP decided that POP regulation needed to be addressed globally for the future. The purpose statement of the agreement is "to protect human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants." As of 2014, there are 179 countries in compliance with the Stockholm convention. The convention and its participants have recognized the potential human and environmental toxicity of POPs. They recognize that POPs have the potential for long range transport and bioaccumulation and biomagnification. The convention seeks to study and then judge whether or not a number of chemicals that have been developed with advances in technology and science can be categorized as POPs or not. The initial meeting in 2001 made a preliminary list, termed the "dirty dozen," of chemicals that are classified as POPs. As of 2014, the [[United States of America]] has signed the Stockholm Convention but has not ratified it. There are a handful of other countries that have not ratified the convention but most countries in the world have ratified the convention.&lt;ref&gt;"STOCKHOLM CONVENTION ON PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS". pp. 1–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compounds on the Stockholm Convention list ===

In May 1995, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] Governing Council investigated POPs.&lt;ref name="thedirtydozen"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dirty Dozen|url=http://www.unido.org/fileadmin/import/29239_popspresentation.swf|publisher=United Nations Industrial Development Organization|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the Convention recognized only twelve POPs for their adverse effects on human health and the environment, placing a global ban on these particularly harmful and toxic compounds and requiring its parties to take measures to eliminate or reduce the release of POPs in the environment.

#'''[[Aldrin]]''', an insecticide used in soils to kill [[termite]]s, [[grasshopper]]s, [[Western corn rootworm]], and others, is also known to kill birds, fish, and humans. Humans are primarily exposed to aldrin through dairy products and animal meats.
#'''[[Chlordane]]''', an insecticide used to control termites and on a range of agricultural crops, is known to be lethal in various species of birds, including mallard ducks, bobwhite quail, and pink shrimp; it is a chemical that remains in the soil with a reported [[half-life]] of one year. Chlordane has been postulated to affect the human immune system and is classified as a possible human [[carcinogen]]. Chlordane air pollution is believed the primary route of humane exposure.
#'''[[Dieldrin]]''', a pesticide used to control termites, textile pests, insect-borne diseases and insects living in agricultural soils. In soil and insects, aldrin can be oxidized, resulting in rapid conversion to dieldrin. Dieldrin’s half-life is approximately five years. [[Dieldrin]] is highly toxic to fish and other aquatic animals, particularly frogs, whose embryos can develop spinal deformities after exposure to low levels. Dieldrin has been linked to [[Parkinson's disease]], [[breast cancer]], and classified as immunotoxic, neurotoxic, with endocrine disrupting capacity. Dieldrin residues have been found in air, water, soil, fish, birds, and mammals. Human exposure to dieldrin primarily derives from food.
#'''[[Endrin]]''', an insecticide sprayed on the leaves of crops, and used to control rodents. Animals can metabolize endrin, so fatty tissue accumulation is not an issue, however the chemical has a long half-life in soil for up to 12 years. Endrin is highly toxic to aquatic animals and humans as a neurotoxin. Human exposure results primarily through food.
#'''[[Heptachlor]]''', a [[pesticide]] primarily used to kill soil insects and termites, along with cotton insects, grasshoppers, other crop pests, and malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Heptachlor, even at every low doses has been associated with the decline of several wild bird populations – [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] and [[American kestrel]]s. In laboratory tests have shown high-dose heptachlor as lethal, with adverse behavioral changes and reduced reproductive success at low-doses, and is classified as a possible human carcinogen. Human exposure primarily results from food.
#'''[[Hexachlorobenzene]] (HCB'''), was first introduced in 1945–59 to treat seeds because it can kill [[Fungicide|fungi]] on food crops. HCB-treated seed grain consumption is associated with photosensitive skin lesions, [[colic]], debilitation, and a [[Metabolic syndrome|metabolic disorder]] called porphyria turcica, which can be lethal. Mothers who pass HCB to their infants through the placenta and breast milk had limited reproductive success including infant death. Human exposure is primarily from food.
#'''[[Mirex]]''', an insecticide used against ants and termites or as a [[flame retardant]] in plastics, rubber, and electrical goods. Mirex is one of the most stable and persistent pesticides, with a half-life of up to 10 years.  Mirex is toxic to several plant, fish and [[crustacean]] species, with suggested carcinogenic capacity in humans. Humans are exposed primarily through animal meat, fish, and wild game.
#'''[[Toxaphene]]''', an insecticide used on cotton, cereal, grain, fruits, nuts, and vegetables, as well as for tick and mite control in livestock. Widespread toxaphene use in the US and chemical persistence, with a half-life of up to 12 years in soil, results in residual toxaphene in the environment. Toxaphene is highly toxic to fish, inducing dramatic weight loss and reduced egg viability. Human exposure primarily results from food. While human toxicity to direct toxaphene exposure is low, the compound is classified as a possible human carcinogen.
#'''[[Polychlorinated biphenyls]]''' (PCBs), used as [[Heat-transfer oil|heat exchange fluids]], in [[transformer|electrical transformers]], and [[capacitor]]s, and as additives in paint, carbonless copy paper, and plastics. Persistence varies with degree of [[halogenation]], an estimated half-life of 10 years. PCBs are toxic to fish at high doses, and associated with spawning failure at low doses. Human exposure occurs through food, and is associated with reproductive failure and immune suppression. Immediate effects of PCB exposure include pigmentation of nails and [[mucous membranes]] and swelling of the eyelids, along with fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Effects are [[Transgenerational epigenetics|transgenerational]], as the chemical can persist in a mother’s body for up to 7 years, resulting in developmental delays and behavioral problems in her children. Food contamination has led to large scale PCB exposure.
#[[DDT|'''Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane''']] (DDT) is probably the most infamous POP. It was widely used as insecticide during WWII to protect against malaria and typhus. After the war, DDT was used as an agricultural insecticide. In 1962, the American biologist [[Rachel Carson]] published [[Silent Spring]], describing the impact of DDT spraying on the US environment and human health. DDT’s persistence in the soil for up to 10–15 years after application has resulted in widespread and persistent DDT residues throughout the world including the arctic, even though it has been banned or severely restricted in most of the world. DDT is toxic to many organisms including birds where it is detrimental to reproduction due to eggshell thinning. DDT can be detected in foods from all over the world and food-borne DDT remains the greatest source of human exposure. Short-term acute effects of DDT on humans are limited, however long-term exposure has been associated with chronic health effects including increased risk of cancer and diabetes, reduced reproductive success, and neurological disease.
#'''[[Dioxins]]''' are unintentional by-products of high-temperature processes, such as incomplete combustion and pesticide production. Dioxins are typically emitted from the burning of hospital waste, municipal waste, and [[hazardous waste]], along with automobile emissions, peat, coal, and wood. Dioxins have been associated with several adverse effects in humans, including immune and enzyme disorders, [[chloracne]], and are classified as a possible human carcinogen. In laboratory studies of dioxin effects an increase in birth defects and stillbirths, and lethal exposure have been associated with the substances. Food, particularly from animals, is the principal source of human exposure to dioxins.
#'''[[Polychlorinated dibenzofurans]]''' are by-products of high-temperature processes, such as incomplete [[combustion]] after [[Incineration|waste incineration]] or in automobiles, pesticide production, and [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] production. Structurally similar to dioxins, the two compounds share toxic effects. Furans persist in the environment and classified as possible human carcinogens. Human exposure to furans primarily results from food, particularly animal products.

=== New POPs on the Stockholm Convention list ===
Since 2001, this list has been expanded to include some [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), [[brominated flame retardant]]s, and other compounds. Additions to the initial 2001 Stockholm Convention list are as following POPs:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Depositary notification | url = http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/download.aspx?d=UNEP-POPS-COP-NOTIF-DN-CN524-2009.English.pdf | publisher = Secretary-General of the United Nations | date = 26 August 2009 | accessdate = 2009-12-17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/CN/2013/CN.934.2013-Eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Chlordecone]], a synthetic chlorinated organic compound,is primarily used as an agricultural pesticide, related to DDT and Mirex. Chlordecone is toxic to aquatic organisms, and classified as a possible human carcinogen. Many countries have banned chlordecone sale and use, or intend to phase out stockpiles and wastes.
*[[alpha-Hexachlorocyclohexane|α-Hexachlorocyclohexane]] (α-HCH) and [[beta-Hexachlorocyclohexane|β-Hexachlorocyclohexane]] (β-HCH) are insecticides as well as by-products in the production of [[lindane]].  Large stockpiles of HCH isomers exist in the environment. α-HCH and β-HCH are highly persistent in the water of colder regions. α-HCH and β-HCH has been linked [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
*[[Hexabromodiphenyl ether]] (hexaBDE) and [[heptabromodiphenyl ether]] (heptaBDE) are main components of commercial [[octabromodiphenyl ether]] (octaBDE). Commercial octaBDE is highly persistent in the environment, whose only degradation pathway is through debromination and the production of [[Bromodiphenylmethane|bromodiphenyl ethers]], which can increase toxicity.
*[[Lindane]] (γ-hexachlorocyclohexane), a pesticide used as a broad spectrum insecticide for seed, soil, leaf, tree and wood treatment, and against [[ectoparasite]]s in animals and humans (head lice and scabies). Lindane rapidly [[Bioconcentration|bioconcentrates]]. It is [[Immunotoxin|immunotoxic]], [[Neurotoxicity|neurotoxic]], [[carcinogenic]], linked to liver and kidney damage as well as adverse reproductive and developmental effects in laboratory animals and aquatic organisms. Production of lindane unintentionally produces two other POPs α-HCH and β-HCH.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
*[[Pentachlorobenzene]] (PeCB), is a pesticide and unintentional byproduct. PeCB has also been used in PCB products, dyestuff carriers, as a fungicide, a flame retardant, and a chemical intermediate. PeCB is moderately toxic to humane, while highly toxic to aquatic organisms.
*[[Tetrabromodiphenyl ether]] (tetraBDE) and pentabromodiphenyl ether (pentaBDE) are industrial chemicals and the main components of commercial pentabromodiphenyl ether (pentaBDE). PentaBDE has been detected in humans in all regions of the world.
*[[Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid]] (PFOS) and its salts are used in the production of fluoropolymers. PFOS and related compounds are extremely persistent, bioaccumulating and [[Biomagnification|biomagnifying]].  The negative effects of trace levels of PFOS have not been established.
*[[Endosulfan]]s are insecticides to control pests on crops such coffee, cotton, rice and sorghum and soybeans, tsetse flies, ectoparasites of cattle. They are used as a [[Wood preservation|wood preservative]]. Global use and manufacturing of endosulfan has been banned under the Stockholm convention in 2011, although many countries had previously banned or introduced phase-outs of the chemical when the ban was announced. Toxic to humans and aquatic and terrestrial organisms, linked to congenital physical disorders, mental retardation, and death. Endosulfans' negative health effects are primarily liked to its endocrine disrupting capacity acting as an [[antiandrogen]].
*[[Hexabromocyclododecane]] (HBCD) is a [[brominated flame retardant]] primarily used in [[thermal insulation]] in the building industry. HBCD is persistent, toxic and [[Ecotoxicity|ecotoxic]], with [[bioaccumulative]] and long-range transport properties.

== Additive and synergistic effects ==
Evaluation of the effects of POPs on health is very challenging in the laboratory setting. For example, for organisms exposed to a mixture of POPs, the effects are assumed to be [[interaction|additive]].&lt;ref name="Harrad, S. 2010"&gt;ed. Harrad, S., "Persistent Organic Pollutants" (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Mixtures of POPs can in principle produce [[interaction|synergistic effects]]. With synergistic effects, the toxicity of each compound is enhanced (or depressed) by the presence of other compounds in the mixture. When put together, the effects can far exceed the approximated additive effects of the POP compound mixture.&lt;ref name="Walker, C.H. 2001"/&gt;

== Health effects ==
POP exposure may cause developmental defects, chronic illnesses, and death. Some are carcinogens per [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]], possibly including [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref name="ritter"/&gt; Many POPs are capable of [[endocrine disruption]] within the [[reproductive system]], the [[central nervous system]], or the [[immune system]]. People and animals are exposed to POPs mostly through their diet, occupationally, or while growing in the womb.&lt;ref name="ritter"/&gt;  For humans not exposed to POPs through accidental or occupational means, over 90% of exposure comes from animal product foods due to bioaccumulation in fat tissues and bioaccumulate through the food chain. In general, POP serum levels increase with age and tend to be higher in females than males.&lt;ref name="Vallack, H.W. 1998"/&gt;

Studies have investigated the correlation between low level exposure of POPs and various diseases. In order to assess disease risk due to POPs in a particular location, government agencies may produce a [[human health risk assessment]] which takes into account the pollutants' [[bioavailability]] and their [[dose-response relationship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Szabo DT, Loccisano AE |title= POPs and Human Health Risk Assessment|journal=Dioxins and Persistent Organic Pollutants |volume=3rd |pages= 579|editor= A. Schecter|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date= March 30, 2012| doi= 10.1002/9781118184141.ch19 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118184141.ch19/summary |isbn= 9781118184141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Endocrine disruption ===
The majority of POPs are known to disrupt normal functioning of the endocrine system. Low level exposure to POPs during critical [[developmental biology|developmental]] periods of fetus, newborn and child can have a lasting effect throughout its lifespan. A 2002 study&lt;ref name="Damstra, T. 2002"&gt;Damstra, T. (2002). Potential Effects of Certain Persistent Organic Pollutants and Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals on Health of Children. ''Clinical Toxicology''. 40(4), 457–465.&lt;/ref&gt; synthesizes data on endocrine disruption and health complications from exposure to POPs during critical developmental stages in an organism’s lifespan. The study aimed to answer the question whether or not chronic, low level exposure to POPs can have a health impact on the endocrine system and development of organisms from different species. The study found that exposure of POPs during a critical developmental time frame can produce a permanent changes in the organisms path of development. Exposure of POPs during non-critical developmental time frames may not lead to detectable diseases and health complications later in their life. In wildlife, the critical development time frames are [[in utero]], [[in ovo]], and during reproductive periods. In humans, the critical development timeframe is during [[prenatal development|fetal development]].&lt;ref&gt;Damstra, T. (2002). Potential Effects of Certain Persistent Organic Pollutants and Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals on Health of Children. ''Clinical Toxicology''. 40(4), 457–465&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproductive system ===
The same study in 2002&lt;ref name="Damstra, T. 2002"/&gt; with evidence of a link from POPs to [[endocrine disruptor|endocrine disruption]] also linked low dose exposure of POPs to [[reproductive health]] effects. The study stated that POP exposure can lead to negative health effects especially in the [[human male reproductive system|male reproductive system]], such as decreased [[sperm]] quality and quantity, altered sex ratio and early [[puberty]] onset. For females exposed to POPs, altered [[human female reproductive system|reproductive tissues]] and [[pregnancy]] outcomes as well as [[endometriosis]] have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;El-Shahawi, M.S., Hamza, A., Bashammakhb, A.S., Al-Saggaf, W.T. (2010). An overview on the accumulation, distribution, transformations, toxicity and analytical methods for the monitoring of persistent organic pollutants. Talanta. 80, 1587–1597&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gestational weight gain and newborn head circumference====
A Greek study from 2014 investigated the link between maternal weight gain during pregnancy, their [[polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]-exposure level and PCB level in their newborn infants, their [[birth weight]], [[gestational age]], and head circumference. The lower the birth weight and head circumference of the infants was, the higher POP levels during [[prenatal development]] had been, but only if mothers had either excessive or inadequate weight gain during pregnancy. No correlation between POP exposure and gestational age was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vafeiadi|first=M|author2=Vrijheid M |author3=Fthenou E |author4=Chalkiadaki G |author5=Rantakokko P |author6=Kiviranta H |author7=Kyrtopoulos SA |author8=Chatzi L |author9=Kogevinas M  |title=Persistent organic pollutants exposure during pregnancy, maternal gestational weight gain, and birth outcomes in the mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece (RHEA study)|journal=Environ Int.|year=2014|volume=64|pages=116–123|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2013.12.015|pmid=24389008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2013 [[case-control study]] conducted 2009 in Indian mothers and their offspring showed prenatal exposure of two types of [[organochlorine pesticides]] ([[Hexachlorocyclohexane|HCH]], [[DDT]] and [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]]) impaired the growth of the [[fetus]], reduced the birth weight, length, head circumference and chest circumference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dewan|first=Jain V,|author2=Gupta P |author3=Banerjee BD. |title=Organochlorine pesticide residues in maternal blood, cord blood, placenta, and breastmilk and their relation to birth size|journal=Chemosphere|date=February 2013|volume=90|issue=5|pages=1704–1710|doi= 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.09.083|pmid=23141556|bibcode=2013Chmsp..90.1704D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Damstra, T. (2002). Potential Effects of Certain Persistent Organic Pollutants and Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals on Health of Children. ''Clinical Toxicology''. 40(4), 457–465. {{PMID|12216998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In urban areas and indoor environments ==
Traditionally it was thought that human exposure to POPs occurred primarily through [[food]], however [[Indoor air quality|indoor pollution]] patterns that characterize certain POPs have challenged this notion. Recent studies of indoor [[dust]] and [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]] have implicated indoor environments as a major sources for human exposure via inhalation and ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, C.H., "Organic Pollutants: An Ecotoxicological Perspective" (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, significant indoor POP pollution must be a major route of human POP exposure, considering the modern trend in spending larger proportions of life indoor. Several studies have shown that indoor (air and dust) POP levels to exceed outdoor (air and soil) POP concentrations.&lt;ref name="Harrad, S. 2010"/&gt;

== Control and removal in the environment ==
Current studies aimed at minimizing POPs in the environment are investigating their behavior in [[photocatalysis|photo catalytic oxidation reactions]].  POPs that are found in humans and in [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic environments]] the most are the main subjects of these experiments. [[aromatic compound|Aromatic]] and [[aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] degradation products have been identified in these reactions. [[photocatalysis|Photochemical degradation]] is negligible compared to photocatalytic degradation.&lt;ref&gt;El-Shahawi, M.S., Hamza, A., Bashammakhb, A.S., Al-Saggaf, W.T. (2010). An overview on the accumulation, distribution, transformations, toxicity and analytical methods for the monitoring of persistent organic pollutants. Talanta. 80, 1587–1597. {{DOI|10.1016/j.talanta.2009.09.055}}&lt;/ref&gt; A method of removal of POPs from marine environments that has been explored is adsorption. It occurs when an absorbable solute comes into contact with a solid with a porous surface structure. This technique was investigated by Mohamed Nageeb Rashed of Aswan University, Egypt. &lt;ref&gt;Rashed, M.N. ''Organic pollutants - Monitoring, risk and treatment''. Intech. London (2013). Chapter 7 - Adsorption techniques for the removal of presistent organic pollutants from water and wastewater. &lt;/ref&gt; Current efforts are more focused on banning the use and production of POPs worldwide rather than removal of POPs.&lt;ref&gt;Vallack, H.W., Bakker, D.J., Brandt, I., Broström-Ludén, E., Brouwer, A., Bull, K.R., Gough, C., Guardans, R., Holoubek, I., Jansson, B., Koch, R., Kuylenstierna, J., Lecloux, A., Mackay, D., McCutcheon, P., Mocarelli, P., Taalman, R.D.F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7525">'''Preservation of meaning''' in library, archival or museum collections involves understanding spiritual, ritual, or cultural perceptions of value for specific objects, and ensuring these values are maintained and respected.  Meaning is something assigned to objects of cultural or spiritual significance based on interpretations and perceived values by user populations, a process known as social construction of an object (Barker, 77).  When moved to [[memory institution]]s such as libraries or museums, these objects of social construction require unique approaches to preservation and maintenance in order to remain relevant as representations of cultural or spiritual societies.

In many memory institutions of the Western World, including libraries and museums, focus is often placed on the informational content and physical attributes, or artifactual value, of collected materials.  Preservation policies are primarily concerned with the maintenance of these two things, either through reformatting to preserve textual information, or repairs and environmental controls to ensure continued existence of their physical structure (Foot, 19). However, it is necessary to look beyond the physical and informational aspects of objects in order to ensure we are also preserving the integrity of the spiritual or cultural values which may be fundamental in defining the object.   
 
Concerns arise when actions taken to preserve the physical object may compromise the spiritual or cultural integrity of a given object.  Artifacts, including books, throughout history and the present were created and utilized according to rules and taboos that may not be inherently understood in today's world of mass consumer goods and material culture.  While not all books, documents, and artifacts have rituals or socially constructed beliefs associated with their continued existence, it is a relevant issue for many cultural and religious collections.

== Examples ==

An extreme example of how efforts to physically preserve may compromise the socially constructed meaning of the object is the [[Shinto]] Shrines of Ise Jingu, in [[Japan]] (Maré, 2004).  These shrines are of significant cultural and spiritual value to the Japanese people, but every twenty years since the time of Emperor Temmu in the 7th century C.E. the buildings are completely destroyed and rebuilt.  The rebuilding process is based on descriptions in the Documents on the rituals of the Great Shrine of Ise which dates from 804 C.E. and ensures that the recreations are exact replicas of the shrines taken down.  Physical preservation of these monuments would damage the spiritual and cultural integrity of the process and purpose behind the continuous rebuilding.

Similarly, in the [[Buddhist]] faith, materials are considered to have a life, which must be allowed to progress and end naturally.  Impermanence (anitya) in the Buddhist faith relates to the natural end of all things, [[nirvana]], and acts of physical preservation would be contrary to this belief (Karlström). Buddhist [[Conservation of South Asian household shrines|shrines]] are an example of such items that hold spiritual meaning. 

Physical preservation can also work to maintain spiritual and culture integrity of an object, especially in the case of musical instruments.  At the violin museum in [[Cremona, Italy]], nine instruments crafted by the [[Amatis]], [[Guarneris]], and by Antonio [[Stradivari]] are played ceremoniously six days a week – both to keep them in good physical, playable condition, and to maintain their cultural significance and meaning.  From the island of [[Java]] in [[Indonesia]], the instruments of the [[gamelan]] are treated with respect and reverence, and played on a regular basis to maintain their physical and spiritual life.  They are played only for certain occasions and only by certain individuals trained in the art.  They must also be handled and stored with care to be sure no one should compromise their spiritual integrity by stepping over them.  (Kartomi and Mendonça) Gamelan instruments can be found in museums throughout North America, but to accurately remain gamelan instruments, they must be treated and respected according to both their physical and spiritual properties.

However, examples of the significance of meaning and spiritual integrity exist in North America as well.  ''[[Jish]]'' is a [[Navajo people|Navajo]] medicine bundle used in religious rituals related to curing or prevention, and specific care and established provenance is necessary to preserve the existence of ''jish'' versus a simple bundle of herb and grasses.  [[NAGPRA]], or North American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act has helped to highlight this issue of meaning and spiritual integrity in the United States.  The act not only covers objects and remains recovered from American Indian graves, but the subsequent literary material developed based on the examination and analysis of these objects.  (Grose)

Preservation of meaning is perhaps most relevant and recognized in museum collections, but this does not mean there are not key books and documents that are defined by their social construction as well as their physical existence.  When a book printed on acid paper turns to dust, there is no doubt that it ceases to exist as book.  However, when books are stacked on top of a [[Koran]], or a [[Guru Granth Sahib]] is repaired rather than ceremoniously cremated, the spiritual integrity of these texts is compromised or destroyed, and the physical object is void of spiritual or cultural meaning.  It may at this point actually cease to be what it had been previously identified as, at least in terms of its cultural or spiritual meaning.

Admittedly, more work and research needs to be done in regard to  preservation of meaning in the area of Library Science.  However, it is necessary for libraries and archival institutions to assess their preservation priorities in consideration of social and cultural meaning in tandem with physical attributes and informational context.  Preservation and curatorial policies and activities can take into account how materials are housed, handled, repaired, or analyzed not just in terms of preserving physical qualities, but spiritual and cultural meaning as well.

[[File:Ranging Rods 2014-08-18 12-53.jpg|thumb|Ranging rod and Offset rod]]
A '''ranging rod''' is a [[surveying]] instrument used for marking the position of stations and for sightings of those stations as well as for ranging [[straight line]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/_/dict.aspx?rd=1&amp;word=ranging+rod | title=free dictionary | accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially these were made of light, thin and straight [[bamboo]] or of well seasoned wood such as [[teak]], [[pine]] or [[Cedrus deodara|deodar]]. They were shod with iron at the bottom and surmounted with a flag about 25 cm square in size. &lt;ref&gt;Surveying by prof. Cl Kocher in chapter Linear Measurements, page no. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays they are made of metallic materials only. The rods are usually 3 cm in diameter and 2 m or 3 m long, painted alternatively either [[red]] and [[white]] or [[black]] and white in lengths of 20 cm (i.e. one link length of metric chain). These colours are used so that the rod can be properly sighted in case of long distance or bad weather. Ranging rods of greater length, i.e., 4 m to 6 m, are called ranging poles and are used in case of very long [[surveying|survey]] lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/r7021e/r7021e02.htm | title=elementary surveying instruments | accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of ranging rod is known as an offset rod, which has no flag at the top. It is used for measuring small offsets from the survey line when the work is of an ordinary nature.&lt;ref&gt;Surveying by prof. Cl Kocher, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
When the ranging rods are limited, thin sticks 40 cm to 1 m length with white [[paper]]s in the cuts at tops can serve their purpose. Such sticks are pointed at the bottom and are cut from wood. These are called as whites.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6263">{{About|the type of plant growth|secondary-growth forests|Secondary forest}}

[[File:Tree swallowing lamp post.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Secondary growth thickens the [[Plant stem|stem]] and [[root]]s, typically making them [[wood]]y. Obstructions such as this metal post and stubs of limbs can be engulfed.]]

In [[botany]], '''secondary growth''' is the growth that results from [[cell division]] in the [[cambium (botany)|cambia]] or lateral [[meristems]] and that causes the [[Plant stem|stem]]s and [[root]]s to thicken, while '''primary growth''' is growth that occurs as a result of cell division at the tips of stems and roots, causing them to elongate, and gives rise to primary tissue. Secondary growth occurs in most [[seed plant]]s, but [[monocots]] usually lack secondary growth. If they do have secondary growth, it differs from the typical pattern of other seed plants.

The formation of secondary vascular tissues from the cambium is a characteristic feature of [[Dicotyledon|dicotyledons]] and [[Gymnosperm|gymnosperms]]. In certain monocots, the vascular tissues are also increased after the primary growth is completed but the cambium of these plants is of a different nature. In the living Pteridophytes this feature is rare but occurs in plants like ''[[Isoetes]]'' and ''[[Botrychium]]''.

==Lateral meristems==
[[File:Tree secondary growth diagram.jpg|thumb|Diagram of secondary growth in a [[tree]] showing idealised vertical and horizontal sections. New [[wood]] is added in each growth season by the lateral meristems, the [[cork cambium]] and [[vascular cambium]].]]

In many [[vascular plants]], secondary growth is the result of the activity of the two lateral meristems, the [[cork cambium]] and [[vascular cambium]]. Arising from ''lateral'' meristems, secondary growth increases the girth of the plant root or stem, rather than its length.  As long as the lateral meristems continue to produce new cells, the stem or root will continue to grow in diameter. In [[woody plant]]s, this process produces [[wood]], and shapes the plant into a [[tree]] with a thickened trunk.

Because this growth usually ruptures the [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] of the stem or roots, plants with secondary growth usually also develop a [[cork cambium]]. The cork cambium gives rise to [[cork (tissue)|thickened cork cells]] to protect the surface of the plant and reduce water loss. If this is kept up over many years, this process may produce a layer of cork. In the case of the [[cork oak]] it will yield harvestable [[cork (material)|cork]].

==In nonwoody plants==

Secondary growth also occurs in many nonwoody plants, e.g. [[tomato]],&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, N.P. and Heimsch, C. 1964. Stem anatomy and aspects of development in tomato. ''American Journal of Botany'' 51: 7-19. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2440057]&lt;/ref&gt; [[potato]] [[tuber]], [[carrot]] [[taproot]] and [[sweet potato]] [[tuberous root]]. A few long-lived leaves also have secondary growth.&lt;ref&gt;Ewers, F.W. 1982. Secondary growth in needle leaves of ''Pinus longaeva'' (bristlecone pine) and other conifers: Quantitative data. ''American Journal of Botany'' 69: 1552-1559. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2442909]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abnormal secondary growth==
[[File:Monocot Stem.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arecaceae|Palms]] (in the picture ''[[Roystonea regia]]'' palm) increase their trunk diameter by means of division and enlargement of parenchyma tissue, without a real secondary growth (production of secondary vascular strands—secondary xylem and phloem tissues—with the consequent enlargement of the canopy and root system).&lt;ref name="Mauseth 2003"&gt;James D. Mauseth, 2003. ''Botany: An Introduction to Plant Biology, Third Edition.''&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Abnormal secondary growth''' does not follow the pattern of a single vascular cambium producing [[xylem]] to the inside and [[phloem]] to the outside as in ancestral lignophytes. Some [[dicot]]s have anomalous secondary growth, e.g. in [[Bougainvillea]] a series of cambia arise outside the oldest phloem.&lt;ref&gt;Esau, K. and Cheadle, V.I. 1969. Secondary growth in bougainvillea. ''Annals of Botany'' 33: 807-819. [http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/33/4/807]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancestral [[monocots]] lost their secondary growth and their stele has changed in a way it could not be recovered without major changes that are very unlikely to occur. Monocots either have no secondary growth, as is the ancestral case, or they have an "anomalous secondary growth" of some type, or, in the case of palms, they enlarge their diameter in what is called a sort of secondary growth or not depending on the definition given to the term. [[Arecaceae|Palm]] trees increase their trunk diameter due to division and enlargement of [[ground tissue#parenchyma|parenchyma]] cells, which is termed "primary gigantism"&lt;ref name="Mauseth 2003" /&gt; because there is no production of secondary xylem and phloem tissues,&lt;ref name="Mauseth 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MG Simpson (2005) "Arecaceae (Palmae)" In: ''Plant Systematics''. p.185: "...Plant sex is variable, and secondary growth is absent..."&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes "diffuse secondary growth".&lt;ref&gt;Esau, K. 1977. ''Anatomy of Seed Plants''. New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; In some other monocot stems as in ''[[Yucca]]'' and ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracena]]'' with anomalous secondary growth, a cambium forms, but it produces vascular bundles and parenchyma internally and just parenchyma externally. Some monocot stems increase in diameter due to the activity of a primary thickening meristem, which is derived from the [[anatomical terms of location#apical|apical]] meristem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Nesting biology and social structure of Euglossa (Euglossa) townsendi Cockerell (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Euglossini)|journal = Insectes Sociaux|date = 2004-11-01|issn = 0020-1812|pages = 400–409|volume = 51|issue = 4|doi = 10.1007/s00040-004-0760-2|language = en|first = S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10270">The '''Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation (SMGF)''' was an independent [[DNA]] and genealogical research institution with the goal of demonstrating how the peoples of the world are related. SMGF collected DNA samples and genealogical information from individuals across the globe to establish these connections.

== History ==
SMGF originated in 1999 and was inspired by several conversations between inventor and philanthropist [[James LeVoy Sorenson]] and [[Brigham Young University]] professor Dr. [[Scott Woodward]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hart|first=John L.|title=Unlocking DNA|url=http://www.ldschurchnewsarchive.com/articles/45453/Unlocking-DNA.html|accessdate=July 26, 2011|newspaper=[[Church News]]|date=April 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr. Sorenson envisioned the development of a [[genetic genealogy|genetic-genealogical]] blueprint of all humankind.  This blueprint, as developed by Dr. Woodward, would show how closely humans are related to one another, demonstrating the familial relationships between unique individuals.  The collection of DNA samples and associated family pedigrees began in 2000, beginning first with Brigham Young University students, and quickly branching outside of Utah, then to the rest of the world.

In 2003, SMGF moved its operations from the Brigham Young University campus to Salt Lake City.  SMGF also outsourced all of its laboratory work to [[Sorenson Genomics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sorensongenomics.com/about-us/|title=Sorenson Genomics - About Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; freeing researchers to create a publicly available online repository.  This repository was known as the Sorenson Database.

SMGF collected more than 100,000 DNA samples and familial pedigrees from donors around the world, all of which were available in the Sorenson Database.  This database was acquired by [[Ancestry.com]] prior to its launch of AncestryDNA when they purchased [[GeneTree]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourgeneticgenealogist.com/2012/05/ancestrycom-buys-genetree-and-launches.html|title=Ancestry.com Buys GeneTree (Another Competitor) and Launches Their New Autosomal DNA Product to Subscribers|publisher=Your Genetic Genealogist}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Genetree was SMGF's commercial arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancestryinsider.org/2012/05/ancestrycom-launches-ancestrydna.html|title=Ancestry.com Launches AncestryDNA|publisher=Ancestry Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sorenson Database ==
The Sorenson Database contained more than 100,000 DNA samples and familial pedigrees, encompassing 2.8 million genealogical records and 2.4 million genotypes.

The Sorenson Database matched genetic information with familial surnames.  A person searching through the database was able to find both genetic and genealogical matches, but could search using either DNA haplotypes or familial surname.  The average family pedigree contained six generations of pedigree information (more than 150 years) with over 6 million genetically linked ancestors.

There were only two areas for individuals to search within the Sorenson Database, a [[Y chromosome]] database and a [[mitochondrial DNA]] database.  The Y-DNA database allowed males to search their direct paternal line; the mtDNA database allowed both males and females search their direct maternal line.  According to ISOGG.org, Sorenson "also had large X chromosome and autosomal STR databases, but these databases were never made publicly available."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://isogg.org/wiki/Sorenson_Molecular_Genealogy_Foundation|title=''Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation'' ISOGG Wiki|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Y-chromosome Database:

The Y chromosome is passed on from father to son with little changes to Y-DNA. Surnames also tend to generally be passed on from father to son. The Sorenson Database used Y-chromosome genetic markers and surnames to determine common ancestors.  Users could share DNA results and pedigree charts obtained from other sources. They could search for ancestors using their surname, genetic marker values obtained through their DNA analysis, or a combination of the two. The database also had genetic marker default values if users did not have their own genetic information.

A Y-DNA test analyzes similarities in Y-chromosome DNA markers, corresponding to specific locations on the Y chromosome. Markers have a [[Short tandem repeat]] (STR) that involve repeats of 2-5 DNA base pairs. At Sorenson labs, the number of STRs in a 36-marker haplotype was compared between the sample given and the database to determine relatedness. The [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) was also examined. Y-chromosome SNPs are rare and can be used to separate populations of men or haplogroups and can be used in population studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfg.stanford.edu/SNP.html|title=''Simple Fool's Guide to Population Genomics'', Stanford University - Palumbi Lab|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitochondrial Database:
 
Both males and females inherit their mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from their mother, which allows mtDNA to determine a maternal line. The Sorenson Database compared mitochondrial DNA from over 76, 000 people in their mitochondrial database to find cousins connected across generations. Users could share their mtDNA results from other commercial labs.

The mtDNA test examines three regions of the D-loop of mtDNA: HVR1, HVR2 and HVR3 which is called the [[Hypervariable region]]. Mutations in these areas of mtDNA are extremely rare and have likely not changed between maternal-line cousins within the last 500 years. Therefore, looking at mutations in these areas can determine maternal lineages. Samples of mtDNA submitted to the Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation were compared to the [[Cambridge Reference Sequence]] (CRS) of mtDNA then to each other for relatedness.

== Participation ==
One of the perhaps overly ambitious missions of SMGF was to connect any two individuals in the world, showing to both how they are related.  In order to accomplish this goal, SMGF collected DNA samples and correlated familial pedigrees from participants around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, Alan (3 July 2011). [http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/07/03/7006641-africans-visit-their-american-cousins]. Published by [[MSNBC]]. Last accessed 19 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; After reaching their 100,000 sample goal, SMGF modified their goals to focus less on collecting new samples and more on analysis of previous samples.

New participants were still accepted through SMGF's subsidiary, [[GeneTree]] for many years. Also, previous SMGF participants could buy their DNA report through GeneTree.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title =Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation’s Genetic Genealogy Database Crosses Historic Milestone with 100,000 DNA Samples, Aided by Multi-Million Dollar Gift from Founder|publisher =Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation|date =April 28, 2010| url =http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100428005716/en/Sorenson-Molecular-Genealogy-Foundation%E2%80%99s-Genetic-Genealogy-Database|accessdate = 19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another goal of SMGF was to advance research in the scientific field of molecular genealogy.  SMGF conducted research to identify additional DNA markers which link an individual to their genealogical family, however direct or distant. SMGF researchers published a number of research papers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100629005443/en/World-15-%E2%80%98Founding-Mothers%E2%80%99-Latest-Study-Sorenson|title=''New World Had at Least 15 Founding Mothers''|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate = 19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of which involved collaborations with other researchers.

DNA collection for the project initially involved drawing blood samples; since August 2002, the SMGF used a mouthwash-based collection method (GenetiRinse), which has the advantage that it can be mailed to participants living in remote areas.

== Controversy and Shutdown ==
In May 2015, Ancestry.com took down the SMGF website, citing that "the site has been used for purposes other than what was intended, forcing [Ancestry.com] to cease operations on the site."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title =RIP Sorenson - A crushing loss|date =May 15, 2015| url =https://dna-explained.com/2015/05/15/rip-sorenson-a-crushing-loss/|accessdate =May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action by Ancestry.com was taken in response to news revelations claiming that the SMGF database had been used by Ancestry.com and local law enforcement, without any court oversight [e.g., a warrant] and in violation of SMGF's privacy policy, to try to tie criminal suspects to crime scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title =How Private DNA Data Led Idaho Cops on a Wild Goose Chase and Linked an Innocent Man to a 20-year-old Murder Case|date =May 1, 2015| url =https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/how-private-dna-data-led-idaho-cops-wild-goose-chase-and-linked-innocent-man-20|accessdate =May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the actions in the case by all parties, particularly Ancestry.com and the local law enforcement, were eventually recognized to have followed proper constitutional procedures of privacy protection and court oversight in the case,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title =Facts Matter!|date =May 3, 2015| url =http://legalgenealogist.com/blog/2015/05/03/facts-matter/|accessdate =May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the scandal significantly impacted Ancestry.com's reputation and led to the decision to deactivate the website and mothball the SMGF database.

It is closely related to [[planet formation]], another branch of [[astronomy]].  Star formation theory, as well as accounting for the formation of a single star, must also account for the statistics of [[binary star]]s and the [[initial mass function]].

===Interstellar clouds===
A [[spiral galaxy]] like the Milky Way contains [[star]]s, [[stellar remnant]]s, and a diffuse [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) of gas and dust. The interstellar medium consists of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; particles per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and is typically composed of roughly 70% [[hydrogen]] by mass, with most of the remaining gas consisting of [[helium]]. This medium has been chemically enriched by trace amounts of [[Metallicity|heavier elements]] that were ejected from stars as they passed beyond the end of their [[main sequence]] lifetime. Higher density regions of the interstellar medium form clouds, or ''[[nebula|diffuse nebulae]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=C.

===Cloud collapse===
An interstellar cloud of gas will remain in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] as long as the [[kinetic energy]] of the gas [[pressure]] is in balance with the [[potential energy]] of the internal [[gravitational force]]. Mathematically this is expressed using the [[virial theorem]], which states that,  to maintain equilibrium, the gravitational potential energy must equal twice the internal thermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a cloud is massive enough that the gas pressure is insufficient to support it, the cloud will undergo [[gravitational collapse]]. The mass above which a cloud will undergo such collapse is called the [[Jeans mass]]. The Jeans mass depends on the temperature and density of the cloud, but is typically thousands to tens of thousands of solar masses.&lt;ref name=prialnik /&gt; This coincides with the typical mass of an [[open cluster]] of stars, which is the end product of a collapsing cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=E. | last=Battaner

A [[supermassive black hole]] at the core of a galaxy may serve to regulate the rate of star formation in a galactic nucleus. A black hole that is accreting infalling matter can become [[Active galactic nucleus|active]], emitting a strong wind through a collimated [[relativistic jet]]. This can limit further star formation. Massive black holes ejecting radio-frequency-emitting particles at near-light speed can also block the formation of new stars in aging galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As it collapses, a molecular cloud breaks into smaller and smaller pieces in a hierarchical manner, until the fragments reach stellar mass. In each of these fragments, the collapsing gas radiates away the energy gained by the release of [[gravitational]] [[potential energy]].  As the density increases, the fragments become opaque and are thus less efficient at radiating away their energy. This raises the temperature of the cloud and inhibits further fragmentation. The fragments now condense into rotating spheres of gas that serve as stellar embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A protostellar cloud will continue to collapse as long as the gravitational binding energy can be eliminated. This excess energy is primarily lost through radiation. However, the collapsing cloud will eventually become opaque to its own radiation, and the energy must be removed through some other means. The dust within the cloud becomes heated to temperatures of {{nowrap|60–100 K}}, and these particles radiate at wavelengths in the far infrared where the cloud is transparent. Thus the dust mediates the further collapse of the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During the collapse, the density of the cloud increases towards the center and thus the middle region becomes optically opaque first. This occurs when the density is about {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; g / cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. A core region, called the First Hydrostatic Core, forms where the collapse is essentially halted. It continues to increase in temperature as determined by the virial theorem. The gas falling toward this opaque region collides with it and creates shock waves that further heat the core.&lt;ref name=larson/&gt;
[[Image:Cepheus B.jpg|thumb|left|[[Composite image]] showing young stars in and around molecular cloud [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]] B.]]
When the core temperature reaches about {{nowrap|2000 K}}, the thermal energy dissociates the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules.&lt;ref name=larson&gt;{{cite journal

The combination of convection within the protostar and radiation from its exterior allow the star to contract further.&lt;ref name=larson/&gt; This continues until the gas is hot enough for the internal [[pressure]] to support the protostar against further gravitational collapse—a state called [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. When this accretion phase is nearly complete, the resulting object is known as a [[protostar]].&lt;ref name=prialnik /&gt;
[[Image:N11 (Hubble).jpg|thumb|right| N11, part of a complex network of gas clouds and star clusters within our neighbouring galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud.]]
Accretion of material onto the protostar continues partially from the newly formed [[circumstellar disc]]. When the density and temperature are high enough, [[deuterium burning|deuterium fusion]] begins, and the outward [[radiation pressure|pressure]] of the resultant radiation slows (but does not stop) the collapse. Material comprising the cloud continues to "rain" onto the [[protostar]]. In this stage bipolar jets are produced called [[Herbig-Haro objects]]. This is probably the means by which excess [[angular momentum]] of the infalling material is expelled, allowing the star to continue to form.
[[File:Star formation region Lupus 3.jpg|left|thumb|Star formation region [[Lupus 3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glory From Gloom|url=https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1804/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
When the surrounding gas and dust envelope disperses and accretion process stops, the star is considered a [[pre–main sequence star]] (PMS star). The energy source of these objects is gravitational contraction, as opposed to hydrogen burning in main sequence stars. The PMS star follows a [[Hayashi track]] on the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram|Hertzsprung–Russell (H–R) diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = C. Hayashi | title=Stellar evolution in early phases of gravitational contraction | journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan | date=1961 | volume=13 | pages=450–452 | bibcode=1961PASJ...13..450H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The contraction will proceed until the [[Hayashi limit]] is reached, and thereafter contraction will continue on a [[Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism|Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale]] with the temperature remaining stable. Stars with less than {{Solar mass|0.5}} thereafter join the main sequence. For more massive PMS stars, at the end of the Hayashi track they will slowly collapse in near hydrostatic equilibrium, following the [[Henyey track]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = L. G. Henyey | author2 = R. Lelevier | author3 = R. D.

| pages=154 | bibcode=1955PASP...67..154H  | doi = 10.1086/126791
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, [[hydrogen]] begins to fuse in the core of the star, and the rest of the enveloping material is cleared away. This ends the protostellar phase and begins the star's [[main sequence]] phase on the H–R diagram.

The stages of the process are well defined in stars with masses around {{Solar mass|1}} or less. In high mass stars, the length of the star formation process is comparable to the other timescales of their evolution, much shorter, and the process is not so well defined. The later evolution of stars are studied in [[stellar evolution]].

The structure of the molecular cloud and the effects of the protostar can be observed in near-IR [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] maps (where the number of stars are counted per unit area and compared to a nearby zero extinction area of sky), continuum dust emission and [[rotational transition]]s of [[Carbon monoxide|CO]] and other molecules; these last two are observed in the millimeter and [[radio astronomy|submillimeter]] range. The radiation from the protostar and early star has to be observed in [[infrared|infrared astronomy]] wavelengths, as the [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] caused by the rest of the cloud in which the star is forming is usually too big to allow us to observe it in the visual part of the spectrum. This presents considerable difficulties as the Earth's atmosphere is almost entirely opaque from 20μm to 850μm, with narrow windows at 200μm and 450μm. Even outside this range, atmospheric subtraction techniques must be used.

Stars of different masses are thought to form by slightly different mechanisms.  The theory of low-mass star formation, which is well-supported by a plethora of observations, suggests that low-mass stars form by the gravitational collapse of rotating density enhancements within molecular clouds.  As described above, the collapse of a rotating cloud of gas and dust leads to the formation of an accretion disk through which matter is channeled onto a central protostar.  For stars with masses higher than about {{Solar mass|8}}, however, the mechanism of star formation is not well understood.

Massive stars emit copious quantities of radiation which pushes against infalling material.  In the past, it was thought that this [[radiation pressure]] might be substantial enough to halt accretion onto the massive protostar and prevent the formation of stars with masses more than a few tens of solar masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = M. G. Wolfire | author2 = J. P. Cassinelli | title = Conditions for the formation of massive stars | journal = Astrophysical Journal | date = 1987 | volume = 319 | issue = 1 | pages = 850–867 | bibcode = 1987ApJ...319..850W  | doi = 10.1086/165503}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent theoretical work has shown that the production of a jet and outflow clears a cavity through which much of the radiation from a massive protostar can escape without hindering accretion through the disk and onto the protostar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = C. F. McKee | author2 = J. C. Tan | title = Massive star formation in 100,000 years from turbulent and pressurized molecular clouds | journal = Nature | date = 2002 | volume = 416 | issue = 6876 | pages = 59–61 | bibcode = 2002Natur.416...59M  | doi = 10.1038/416059a | pmid = 11882889|arxiv = astro-ph/0203071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = R.

There is mounting evidence that at least some massive protostars are indeed surrounded by accretion disks.  Several other theories of massive star formation remain to be tested observationally.  Of these, perhaps the most prominent is the theory of competitive accretion, which suggests that massive protostars are "seeded" by low-mass protostars which compete with other protostars to draw in matter from the entire parent molecular cloud, instead of simply from a small local region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = I.

Another theory of massive star formation suggests that massive stars may form by the coalescence of two or more stars of lower mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = I. A. Bonnell | author2 = M.

'''Starlight''' is a software product originally developed at [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] and now by Future Point Systems. It is an advanced [[Visual analytics|visual analysis]] environment. In addition to using [[information visualization]] to show the importance of individual pieces of data by showing how they relate to one another, it also contains a small suite of tools useful for collaboration and data sharing, as well as data conversion, processing, augmentation and loading.

The software, originally developed for the [[United States Intelligence Community|intelligence community]], allows users to load data from XML files, databases, RSS feeds, web services, HTML files, Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel, CSV, Adobe PDF, TXT files, etc. and analyze it with a variety of visualizations and tools. The system integrates structured, unstructured, geospatial, and multimedia data, offering comparisons of information at multiple levels of abstraction, simultaneously and in near real-time. In addition Starlight allows users to build their own named entity-extractors using a combination of algorithms, targeted normalization lists and regular expressions in the Starlight Data Engineer (SDE).

As an example, Starlight might be used to look for correlations in a database containing records about chemical spills. An analyst could begin by grouping records according to the cause of the spill to reveal general trends. Sorting the data a second time, they could apply different colors based on related details such as the company responsible, age of equipment or geographic location. Maps and photographs could be integrated into the display, making it even easier to recognize connections among multiple variables.

Starlight has been deployed to both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and used on a number of large-scale projects.

PNNL began developing Starlight in the mid-90's, with funding from the Land Information Warfare Agency,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/features/doe/2002-03/dnnl-ias061402.php Information analysis—by Starlight]&lt;/ref&gt; a part of the Army Intelligence and Security Command and continued developed at the laboratory with funding from the NSA and the CIA. Starlight integrates visual representations of reports, radio transcripts, radar signals, maps and other information. The software system was recently honored with an R&amp;D 100 Award&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rdmag.com/ShowPR.aspx?PUBCODE=014&amp;ACCT=1400000100&amp;ISSUE=0309&amp;RELTYPE=PR&amp;ORIGRELTYPE=FE&amp;PRODCODE=00000000&amp;PRODLETT=AE&amp;CommonCount=0 R&amp;D 100 Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; for technical innovation.

In 2006 Future Point Systems, a Silicon Valley startup, acquired rights to jointly develop and distribute the Starlight product in cooperation with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

The software is now also used outside of the military/intelligence communities in a number of commercial environments.

SuperCam is being developed in collaboration between [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], the Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology ([[Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology|IRAP]]) in France, the French Space Agency ([[CNES]]), the [[University of Hawaii]] and the [[University of Valladolid]] in Spain. The Principal Investigator is Roger Williams from [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]].
SuperCam is an improved version of the successful [[Chemistry and Camera complex|ChemCam]] instruments of the ''Curiosity'' rover that have been upgraded with two different lasers and detectors.&lt;ref name="Plan Soci 2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goenka 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2020Rover-Scientists"/&gt;

In April 2018, SuperCam entered the final stages of assembly and testing. The flight model is scheduled to be integrated in 2018 and installed to the rover later the same year. The rover mission is planned to launch in July 2020.

Himanshu Goenka, ''International Business Times''. 26 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The total is four complementary spectrometers, making the suite sensitive enough to measure trace amounts of chemicals.&lt;ref name="Plan Soci 2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spectro"/&gt;  In April 2018, SuperCam entered the final stages of assembly and testing.&lt;ref name="Plan Soci 2018"/&gt;

===LIBS===

Its remote [[laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy]] (LIBS) emits a 1064-nm red laser beam to investigate targets as small as a grain of rice from a distance of more than 7 meters, allowing the rover to study targets beyond the reach of its arm.&lt;ref name="2020Rover-Public"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spectro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PhysOrg2018"/&gt; The beam vaporizes a tiny amount of rock, creating a hot [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. SuperCam then measures the colors of light in the plasma, which provide clues to the target's elemental composition.&lt;ref name="Goenka 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spectro"/&gt; Its laser is also capable of remotely clearing away surface dust, giving all of its instruments a clear view of the targets.&lt;ref name="2020Rover-Public"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spectro"/&gt; LIBS unit contains three spectrometers. Two of these handle the visible and violet portion of the VISIR spectra, while the IR portion is recorded in the mast.&lt;ref name="Page54"&gt;[http://www.spectroscopyonline.com/supercam-remote-sensing-instrument-suite-mars-2020-rover-preview?pageID=4 The SuperCam Remote Sensing Instrument Suite for the Mars 2020 Rover: A Preview].

===Raman spectroscopy===

SuperCam's [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman spectrometer]] (at 532 nm) investigate targets up to 12 m from the rover. In the Raman spectroscopy technique, most of the green laser light reflects back at the same wavelength that was sent, but a small fraction of the light interacts with the target molecules, changing the wavelength in proportion to the vibrational energy of the molecular bonds. By spectrally observing the returned Raman light, the identity of the minerals can be determined.&lt;ref name="Gardiner"&gt;{{cite book| last = Gardiner| first = D.J. | title = Practical Raman spectroscopy| publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]| series = | date = 1989| doi = | isbn = 978-0-387-50254-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2016.036.epdf|doi=10.1038/nprot.2016.036|pmid=26963630|language=en|access-date=2017-05-22|title=Using Raman spectroscopy to characterize biological materials|journal=Nature Protocols|volume=11|issue=4|pages=664–87|date=April 2016|last1=Martin|first1=Francis L.|last2=Stone|first2=Nicholas|last3=McAinsh|first3=Martin R.|last4=Walsh|first4=Michael J.|last5=Martin-Hirsch|first5=Pierre L.|last6=Gardner|first6=Benjamin|last7=Fullwood|first7=Nigel J.|last8=Esmonde-White|first8=Karen|last9=Dorney|first9=Jennifer|last10=Curtis|first10=Kelly|last11=Cinque|first11=Gianfelice|last12=Bird|first12=Benjamin|last13=Ashton|first13=Lorna|last14=Butler|first14=Holly J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IR spectrometer===

The [[Infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectrometer]], provided by France, operates in the [[near-infrared]] (1.3 to 2.6 micrometers) wavelengths and its [[photodiodes]], or detectors, are cooled by small thermoelectric coolers to ensure that they operate between -100°C and -50°C at all times.&lt;ref name="Page54"/&gt; This instrument will analyze many of the [[clay minerals]] and help unravel the history of liquid [[water on Mars]].&lt;ref name="Plan Soci 2018"/&gt; The types of clay minerals and their abundances give clues about the nature of the water that was present, whether fresh or salty, acidic or neutral [[pH]], whether it might have been icy or warm, and whether the water was present for a long period of time.&lt;ref name="Plan Soci 2018"/&gt; These are key questions to understand  [[Planetary habitability|how habitable]] the surface environment was in the distant past.

===Camera/telescope===

SuperCam's optical camera acquires high-resolution color images of samples under study, which also help determine the surface geology. This camera can also study how [[Water on Mars|atmospheric water]] and dust absorb or reflect solar radiation, which may help to develop [[Climate of Mars|weather forecasts]].&lt;ref name="2020Rover-Public"/&gt; SuperCam is also equipped with a microphone to capture the first audio recordings from the surface of Mars.&lt;ref name="Plan Soci 2018"/&gt; The microphone is the same model (Knowles Electret) as the ones that flew to Mars on the 1998 [[Mars Polar Lander]] and the 2007 [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|''Phoenix'' lander]].&lt;ref name="Spectro"/&gt; However, neither mission was able to record sounds.&lt;ref name="Spectro"/&gt;

===Spectrometers - Table ===

The detectors of all four spectrometers are cooled to just below 0°C by thermoelectric coolers. The  [[photodiodes]] for the infrared (IR) spectrometer are further cooled to between -100°C and -50°C at all times.&lt;ref name="Page54"/&gt;

{{farming}}

'''Urban agriculture,''' '''urban farming''', or '''urban gardening''' is the practice of cultivating, processing and distributing [[food]] in or around [[urban areas]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailkey, M., and J. Nasr. 2000. "From Brownfields to Greenfields: Producing Food in North American Cities," ''Community Food Security News''. Fall 1999/Winter 2000:6&lt;/ref&gt; Urban agriculture can also involve [[animal husbandry]], [[aquaculture]], [[agroforestry]], [[urban beekeeping]], and [[horticulture]]. These activities occur in [[peri-urban]] areas as well, and [[peri-urban agriculture]] may have different characteristics.&lt;ref name="otherurbanag"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fanrpan.org/archive/documents/d00780/|title=The role of urban agriculture in addressing household poverty and food security: the case of Zambia|author1=Hampwaye, G.|author2=Nel, E.|date=|website=|publisher=Gdnet.org|accessdate=1 April 2013|author3=Ingombe, L.|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Urban agriculture can reflect varying levels of economic and social development. It may be a social movement for sustainable communities, where organic growers, "foodies," and "[[locavore]]s" form social networks founded on a shared ethos of nature and community holism. These networks can evolve when receiving formal institutional support, becoming integrated into local town planning as a "transition town" movement for sustainable urban development. For others, [[food security]], nutrition, and income generation are key motivations for the practice. In either case, more direct access to fresh vegetables, fruits, and meat products through urban agriculture can improve food security and [[food safety]].

==History==
In semi-desert towns of Persia, oases were fed through aqueducts that carried mountain water to support intensive food production, nurtured by wastes from the communities.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Continuous productive urban landscapes : designing urban agriculture for sustainable cities|last=André.|first=Viljoen|date=2005|publisher=Architectural Press|others=Bohn, Katrin., Howe, J. (Joe)|isbn=9780750655439|location=Oxford|oclc=60533269}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Machu Picchu]], water was conserved and reused as part of the stepped architecture of the city, and vegetable beds were designed to gather sun in order to prolong the growing season.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

[[File:City experiment in gardening, New York City LCCN93501876.jpg|thumb|left|A gardening demonstration in New York City, 1922]] The idea of supplemental food production beyond rural farming operations and distant imports is not new. It has been used during war and depression times when food shortage issues arose, as well as during times of relative abundance. [[Allotment garden]]s came up in Germany in the early 19th century as a response to poverty and food insecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www2.gtz.de/Dokumente/oe44/ecosan/nl/en-allotment-gardens-cagayan-de-oro-2005.pdf |title=untitles |access-date=13 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719034258/http://www2.gtz.de/Dokumente/oe44/ecosan/nl/en-allotment-gardens-cagayan-de-oro-2005.pdf |archive-date=19 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1893, citizens of a depression-struck [[Detroit]] were asked to use any vacant lots to grow vegetables. They were nicknamed Pingree's Potato Patches after the mayor, [[Hazen S. Pingree]], who came up with the idea. He intended for these gardens to produce income, food supply, and even boost independence during times of hardship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hazen S. Pingree Monument|url=http://historicdetroit.org/building/hazen-s-pingree-monument/|website=http://historicdetroit.org/|publisher=DAN AUSTIN}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victory garden]]s sprouted during WWI and WWII and were fruit, vegetable, and herb gardens in US, Canada, and UK. This effort was undertaken by citizens to reduce pressure on food production that was to support the war effort. 

During the first World War, President Woodrow Wilson called upon all American citizens to utilize any available open space for food growth, seeing this as a way to pull them out of a potentially damaging situation. Because most of Europe was consumed with war, they were unable to produce sufficient food supplies to be shipped to the U.S., and a new plan was implemented with the intent to feed the U.S. and even supply a surplus to other countries in need. By the year 1919, over 5 million plots were growing food and over 500 million pounds of produce was harvested. 

[[File:MONTREUIL - Le clos des peches.jpg|thumb|Peaches in [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis]], [[France]]]]
A very similar practice came into use during the Great Depression that provided a purpose, a job, and food to those who would otherwise be without anything during such harsh times. In this case, these efforts helped to raise spirits socially as well as to boost economic growth. Over 2.8 million dollars worth of food was produced from the subsistence gardens during the Depression. By the time of the Second World War, the War/Food Administration set up a National Victory Garden Program that set out to systematically establish functioning agriculture within cities. With this new plan in action, as many as 5.5 million Americans took part in the victory garden movement and over 9 million pounds of fruit and vegetables were grown a year, accounting for 44% of U.S.-grown produce throughout that time.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[Community garden]]ing in most communities are open to the public and provide space for citizens to cultivate plants for food or recreation. A community gardening program that is well-established is Seattle's [[P-Patch]]. The grassroots [[permaculture]] movement has been hugely influential in the renaissance of urban agriculture throughout the world.  The Severn Project in Bristol was started in 2010 for £2500 and provides 34 tons of produce per year, employing people from disadvantaged backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Severn Project|url=http://www.thesevernproject.org/our-story/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|City farm}}''City farms'' are agricultural plots in [[urban area]]s, which involve people working with [[Animal agriculture|animals]] and plants to produce food. City farms are usually [[Community gardening|community-run gardens]] which aim to improve community relationships and offer an awareness of [[agriculture]] and [[farming]] to people who live in urbanized areas. City farms are important sources of [[food security]] for many communities around the globe. City farms vary in size from small plots in private yards to larger farms that occupy a number of acres. In 1996, a United Nations report estimated there are over 800 million people worldwide who grow food and raise livestock in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Lawson| first=Laura| date=2016-12-22| title=Agriculture: Sowing the city| url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v540/n7634/full/540522a.html| journal=Nature| language=en| volume=540| issue=7634| pages=522–524| doi=10.1038/540522a| issn=0028-0836| bibcode=2016Natur.540..522L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although some city farms have paid employees, most rely heavily on volunteer labour, and some are run by volunteers alone. Other city farms operate as partnerships with [[local authority|local authorities]].

During the 1960s a number of [[community gardens]] were established in the [[United Kingdom]], influenced by the community garden movement in the [[United States]]. The first city farm was set up in 1972 in [[Kentish Town]], [[London]]. It combined farm animals with gardening space, an addition inspired by children's farms in the [[Netherlands]]. Other city farms followed across London and the United Kingdom. In Australia, several city farms exist in various capital cities. In [[Melbourne]], the [[Collingwood Children's Farm]] was established in 1979 on the Abbotsford Precinct Heritage Farmlands (the APHF), the oldest continually farmed land in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], farmed since 1838.

In 2010, New York City saw the building and opening of the world's largest privately owned and operated [[rooftop farm]], followed by an even larger location in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/new-york-could-grown-all-its-own-food-180949748/|title=History, Travel, Arts, Science, People, Places - Smithsonian|work=smithsonianmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both were a result of municipal programs such as The Green Roof Tax Abatement Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/sustainability/green_roofs.shtml|title=Department of Buildings|work=nyc.gov|access-date=9 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213083527/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/sustainability/green_roofs.shtml|archive-date=13 February 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Green Infrastructure Grant Program.&lt;ref&gt;https://a826-web01.nyc.gov/GIGrant/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives==

===Resource and economic===
The Urban Agriculture Network has defined urban agriculture as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Urban agriculture : food, jobs and sustainable cities|date=1996|publisher=United Nations Development Programme|others=Cheema, G. Shabbir., Smit, Jac., Ratta, Annu., Nasr, Joe., United Nations Development Programme., Urban Agriculture Network.|isbn=9789211260472|location=New York, N.Y.|oclc=34575217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[A]n industry that produces, processes, and markets food, fuel, and other outputs, largely 
in response to the daily demand of consumers within a town, city, or [[metropolis]], on many 
types of privately and publicly held land and water bodies found throughout intra-urban and 
peri-urban areas. Typically urban agriculture applies [[intensive agriculture|intensive production]] methods, 
frequently using and reusing natural resources and urban wastes, to yield a diverse array of 
land-, water-, and air-based fauna and flora contributing to the food security, health, 
livelihood, and environment of the individual, household, and community.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Globalization has removed the need and ability of a community's agency in their food production. This results in an inability to address food injustice on a smaller, more manageable scale. This is especially true in cities. Today, most cities have lots of vacant land due to urban sprawl and home foreclosures. This land could be used to address food insecurity. One study of Cleveland shows that city could actually meet up to 100% of its fresh produce need. This would prevent up to $115 million in annual economic leakage. Using the rooftop space of New York City would also be able to provide roughly twice the amount of space necessary to supply New York City with its green vegetable yields. Space could be even better optimized through the usage of hydroponic or indoor factory production of food. Growing gardens within cities would also cut down on the amount of food waste. In order to fund these projects, it would require financial capital in the form of private enterprises or government funding. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grewal|first=Sharanbir S.|last2=Grewal|first2=Parwinder S.|title=Can cities become self-reliant in food?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264275111000692|journal=Cities|volume=29|issue=1|pages=1–11|doi=10.1016/j.cities.2011.06.003|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Environmental===
The [[Council for Agricultural Science and Technology]] (CAST) defines urban agriculture to include aspects of environmental health, remediation, and recreation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cast-science.org |author=Butler, L. and D.M. Moronek (eds.)|date=May 2002 |title=Urban and Agriculture Communities: Opportunities for Common Ground |publisher=Council for Agricultural Science and Technology |location=Ames, Iowa |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Urban agriculture is a complex system encompassing a spectrum of interests, from a traditional core of activities associated with the production, processing, marketing, distribution, and consumption, to a multiplicity of other benefits and services that are less widely acknowledged and documented. These include recreation and leisure; economic vitality and business entrepreneurship, individual health and well-being; community health and well being; landscape beautification; and environmental restoration and remediation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Modern planning and design initiatives&lt;ref name="Boeing2016"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/how-neighborhoods-lost-food/|author=Boeing, G.|title=How Our Neighborhoods Lost Food, and How They Can Get It Back|journal=Progressive Planning|date=2016|volume=206|issue=Winter|pages=35–37|accessdate=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; are often more responsive to this model of urban agriculture because it fits within the current scope of [[sustainable design]]. The definition allows for a multitude of interpretations across cultures and time. Frequently it is tied to policy decisions to build sustainable cities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fraser | first1 = Evan D.G. | year = 2002 | title = Urban Ecology in Bangkok Thailand: Community Participation, Urban Agriculture and Forestry | url = | journal = Environments | volume = 30 | issue = | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban farms also provide unique opportunities for individuals, especially those living in cities, to get actively involved with ecological citizenship. By reconnecting with food production and nature, urban community gardening teaches individuals the skills necessary to participate in a democratic society. Decisions must be made on a group-level basis in order to run the farm. Most effective results are achieved when residents of a community are asked to take on more active roles in the farm. &lt;ref&gt;Katharine Travaline &amp; Christian Hunold (2010) Urban agriculture and ecological citizenship in Philadelphia, Local Environment, 15:6, 581-590, DOI: 10.1080/13549839.2010.487529&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food security===
{{main article |Food security}}
Access to nutritious food, both economically and geographically, is another perspective in the effort to locate food and livestock production in cities. With the tremendous influx of world population to urban areas, the need for fresh and safe food is increased. The [[Community Food Security Coalition]] (CFSC) defines food security as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
All persons in a community having access to culturally acceptable, nutritionally adequate food through local, non-emergency sources at all times.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Areas faced with food security issues have limited choices, often relying on highly [[food processing|processed]] [[fast food]] or convenience store foods that are high in calories and low in nutrients, which may lead to elevated rates of diet-related illnesses such as diabetes. These problems have brought about the concept of [[food justice]] which Alkon and Norgaard (2009; 289) explain is, "places access to healthy, affordable, culturally appropriate food in the contexts of institutional racism, racial formation, and racialized geographies.... Food justice serves as a theoretical and political bridge between scholarship and activism on sustainable agriculture, food insecurity, and [[environmental justice]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00291.x |title=Breaking the Food Chains: An Investigation of Food Justice Activism |journal=Sociological Inquiry |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=289–305 |year=2009 |last1=Alkon |first1=Alison Hope |last2=Norgaard |first2=Kari Marie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some systematic reviews have already explored urban agriculture contribution to food security and other determinants of health outcomes (see &lt;ref name="Audate PP, Fernandez MA, Cloutier G, Lebel A 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2196/resprot.9427 |pmid=29588270 |pmc=5893886 |title=Impacts of Urban Agriculture on the Determinants of Health: Scoping Review Protocol |journal=JMIR |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=e89 |year=2018 |last1=Audate |first1=PP |last2=Fernandez |first2=MA |last3=Cloutier |first3=G |last4=Lebel |first4=A }} http://www.researchprotocols.org/2018/3/e89&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Impact==

===Economic===
Urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) expands the economic base of the city through production, processing, packaging, and [[agricultural marketing|marketing]] of consumable products. This results in an increase in entrepreneurial activities and the [[job creation|creation of jobs]], as well as reducing food costs and improving quality.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Urban agriculture for sustainable cities: using wastes and idle land and water bodies as resources. Jac Smit, Joe Nasr. ''Environment and Urbanization,'' Vol 4, Issue 2, pp. 141 - 152. First Published October 1, 1992. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1177/095624789200400214&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; UPA provides employment, income, and access to food for urban populations, which helps to relieve chronic and emergency food insecurity. Chronic food insecurity refers to less affordable food and growing [[urban poverty]], while emergency food insecurity relates to breakdowns in the chain of [[food distribution]]. UPA plays an important role in making food more affordable and in providing emergency supplies of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fcit/upa/en/ |author=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |title=Urban and Peri-urban Agriculture, Household Food Security and Nutrition |publisher=FAO |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into market values for produce grown in urban gardens has attributed to a [[community garden]] plot a median yield value of between approximately $200 and $500 (US, adjusted for inflation).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/newsltr/v7n3/sa-10.htm Sommers, L., and B.

===Social===
[[File:Kstovo-hay-1536.jpg|thumb|The needs of urban landscaping can be combined with those of suburban livestock farmers. ([[Kstovo]], Russia).]]

Urban agriculture can have a large impact on the social and emotional well-being of individuals. &lt;ref name="Wakefield, S. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/heapro/dam001 |pmid=17324956 |title=Growing urban health: Community gardening in South-East Toronto |journal=Health Promotion International |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=92–101 |year=2007 |last1=Wakefield |first1=S. |last2=Yeudall |first2=F. |last3=Taron |first3=C. |last4=Reynolds |first4=J. |last5=Skinner |first5=A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; UA can have an overall positive impact on [[community health]], which directly impacts individuals social and emotional well-being.   &lt;ref name="Wakefield, S. 2007"/&gt; Urban gardens are often places that facilitate positive [[social interaction]], which also contributes to overall social and emotional well-being. Many gardens facilitate the improvement of social networks within the communities that they are located. For many neighborhoods, gardens provide a “symbolic focus,” which leads to increased neighborhood pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1353-8292(00)00013-7 |pmid=11027957 |title=A survey of community gardens in upstate New York: Implications for health promotion and community development |journal=Health &amp; Place |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=319–27 |year=2000 |last1=Armstrong |first1=Donna }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to the previous point, urban agriculture increases community participation through sensibilization and diagnostic workshops or different commissions in the area of vegetable gardens. Activities which involve hundreds of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00444|title=Increased community participation. [Social Impact].

When individuals come together around UA, physical activity levels are often increased.  Many state that working in agriculture is much more interesting and fulfilling than going to the gym, and that it makes getting [[physical exercise|exercise]] “fun.”  In addition to the exercise that individuals receive while actually working in gardens, many people say that the majority of the exercise they receive through urban agriculture is actually getting to the gardens—many people either walk or ride their bike to the sites, which provides many physical benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02614360902769894 |title=Cultivating health and wellbeing: Members' perceptions of the health benefits of a Port Melbourne community garden |journal=Leisure Studies |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=207–19 |year=2009 |last1=Kingsley |first1=Jonathan 'Yotti' |last2=Townsend |first2=Mardie |last3=Henderson‐Wilson |first3=Claire }}&lt;/ref&gt;

UPA can be seen as a means of improving the [[livelihood]] of people living in and around cities. Taking part in such practices is seen mostly as informal activity, but in many cities where inadequate, unreliable, and irregular access to food is a recurring problem, urban agriculture has been a positive response to tackling food concerns. Due to the food security that comes with UA, feelings of independence and empowerment often arise. The ability to produce and grow food for oneself has also been reported to improve levels of self-esteem or of self-efficacy.&lt;ref name="Wakefield, S. 2007"/&gt; Households and small communities take advantage of vacant land and contribute not only to their household food needs but also the needs of their resident city.&lt;ref name=Hales&gt;[http://www.mygreenhobby.com/urban-agriculture-why-it-has-a-positive-impact/ Hales et al. (2016). "Urban Agriculture: Urban agriculture, positive impact"] ''My Green Hobby''&lt;/ref&gt; The CFSC states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Community and residential gardening, as well as small-scale farming, save household food dollars. They promote nutrition and free cash for non-garden foods and other items. As an example, you can raise your own chickens on an urban farm and have fresh eggs for only $0.44 per dozen.&lt;ref&gt;What's the Real Cost of Raising Backyard Chickens? (2015, March 29). Retrieved April 2, 2015, from http://www.urbanfarminghq.com/cost-of-raising-backyard-chickens/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402184950/http://www.urbanfarminghq.com/cost-of-raising-backyard-chickens/ |date=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This allows families to generate larger incomes selling to local [[grocer]]s or to local outdoor markets while supplying their household with the proper nutrition of fresh and nutritional products.

Some community urban farms can be quite efficient and help women find work, who in some cases are marginalized from finding employment in the formal economy.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. (1999). "Issues in Urban Agriculture," ''FAO Spotlight Magazine,'' January.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that participation from women have a higher production rate, therefore producing the adequate amount for household consumption while supplying more for market sale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idrc.ca/fr/ev-2490-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html#gender%20and%20land Mahbuba Kaneez Hasna.

As most UA activities are conducted on vacant municipal land, there have been raising concerns about the allocation of land and property rights. The [[International Development Research Centre|IDRC]] and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] have published the Guidelines for Municipal Policymaking on Urban Agriculture, and are working with municipal governments to create successful policy measures that can be incorporated in urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;IDRC/ UN-HABITAT".Guidelines for Municipal Policymaking on Urban Agriculture" Urban Agriculture: Land Management and Physical Planning (2003) [http://www.ruaf.org/sites/default/files/Guideline%203%20Urban%20agriculture%20-%20Land%20Management%20and%20Physical%20Planning.pdf PDF] 1.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a third of U.S. households, roughly 42 million, participate in food gardening.  There has also been an increase of 63% participation in farming by millennials from 2008-2013. US households participating in community gardening has also tripled from 1 to 3 million in that time frame. Urban agriculture provides unique opportunities to bridge diverse communities together. In addition, it provides opportunities for health care providers to interact with their patients. Thus, making each community garden a hub that is reflective of the community. &lt;ref&gt;Alaimo, K., Beavers, A.W., Crawford, C. et al. Curr Envir Health Rpt (2016) 3: 302. https://doi.org/10.1007/s40572-016-0105-0
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy efficiency===
[[File:Mushroom growing kit, BTTR Ventures.jpg|thumb|upright|Edible Oyster Mushrooms growing on used coffee grounds]]
The current [[industrial agriculture]] system is accountable for high [[energy economics|energy costs]] for the [[transportation]] of foodstuffs. According to a study by Rich Pirog, the associate director of the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University, the average conventional produce item travels {{convert|1500|mi}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leopold.iastate.edu/pubs/staff/files/food_travel072103.pdf |title=Pirog, R. and A. Benjamin. ''"Checking the food odometer: Comparing food miles for local versus conventional produce sales to Iowa institutions"'', Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture, 2003 |publisher=Leopold.iastate.edu |accessdate=1 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514150840/http://www.leopold.iastate.edu/pubs/staff/files/food_travel072103.pdf |archive-date=14 May 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; using, if shipped by [[tractor-trailer]], {{convert|1|USgal}} of fossil fuel per {{convert|100|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/07/AR2008030702520.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Eat Locally, Ease Climate Change Globally | date=9 March 2008 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy used to transport food is decreased when urban agriculture can provide cities with locally grown food. Pirog found that traditional, non-local, food distribution system used 4 to 17 times more fuel and emitted 5 to 17 times more {{CO2}} than the local and [[Regional Transportation Plan|regional transport]].&lt;ref&gt;Pirog, Rich S.; Van Pelt, Timothy; Enshayan, Kamyar; and Cook, Ellen, "Food, Fuel, and Freeways: An Iowa perspective on how far food travels, fuel usage, and greenhouse gas emissions" (2001). Leopold Center Pubs and Papers. 3. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/leopold_pubspapers/3&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in a study by Marc Xuereb and Region of Waterloo Public Health, they estimated that switching to locally grown food could save transport-related emissions equivalent to nearly 50,000 metric tons of {{CO2}}, or the equivalent of taking 16,191 cars off the road.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;Xuereb, Marc. (2005). "Food Miles: Environmental Implications of Food Imports to Waterloo Region." Public Health Planner Region of Waterloo Public Health.

{{see also|Energy efficiency in agriculture|Efficient energy use}}

===Carbon footprint===
As mentioned above, the energy-efficient nature of urban agriculture can reduce each city's [[carbon footprint]] by reducing the amount of transport that occurs to deliver goods to the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delta-institute.org/content/urban-agriculture Delta Institute, "Urban Agriculture."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928072314/http://www.delta-institute.org/content/urban-agriculture |date=28 September 2013 }} Web. 25 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, these areas can act as [[carbon sink]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowe|first=D. Bradley|title=Green roofs as a means of pollution abatement|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0269749110004859|journal=Environmental Pollution|volume=159|issue=8–9|pages=2100–2110|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2010.10.029|pmid=21074914|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; offsetting some of the carbon accumulation that is innate to urban areas, where pavement and buildings outnumber plants. Plants absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) and release breathable oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) through [[photosynthesis]]. The process of [[Carbon Sequestration]] can be further improved by combining other agriculture techniques to increase removal from the atmosphere and prevent the release of {{CO2}} during harvest time. However, this process relies heavily on the types of plants selected and the methodology of farming.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; Specifically, choosing plants that do not lose their leaves and [[evergreen|remain green all year]] can increase the farm's ability to sequester carbon.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;

===Reduction in ozone and particulate matter===
The reduction in [[ozone]] and other [[particulate matter]] can benefit human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s1352-2310(99)00144-2 |title=Air pollution in cities |journal=Atmospheric Environment |volume=33 |issue=24–25 |pages=4029–37 |year=1999 |last1=Mayer |first1=Helmut |bibcode=1999AtmEn..33.4029M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reducing these particulates and ozone gases could reduce [[mortality rate]]s in urban areas along with increase the health of those living in cities. Just to give one example, in the article “[[Green roof]]s as a means of pollution abatement,” the author argues that a rooftop containing 2000 m² of uncut [[grass]] has the potential to remove up to 4000&amp;nbsp;kg of particulate matter. According to the article, only one square meter of green roof is needed to offset the annual particulate matter emissions of a car.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Affairs Department, City of Los Angeles. 2006. "Green Roofs - Cooling Los Angeles: A Resource Guide". http://environmentla.org/pdf/EnvironmentalBusinessProgs/Green%20Roofs%20Resource%20Guide%202007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2010.10.029 |pmid=21074914 |title=Green roofs as a means of pollution abatement |journal=Environmental Pollution |volume=159 |issue=8–9 |pages=2100–10 |year=2011 |last1=Rowe |first1=D. Bradley }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soil decontamination===
Vacant urban lots are often victim to illegal dumping of hazardous chemicals and other wastes. They are also liable to accumulate standing water and “[[grey water]]”, which can be dangerous to public health, especially left stagnant for long periods. The implementation of urban agriculture in these vacant lots can be a cost-effective method for removing these chemicals. In the process known as [[Phytoremediation]], plants and the associated microorganisms are selected for their chemical ability to degrade, absorb, convert to an inert form, and remove toxins from the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Black, H. "Absorbing Possibilities: Phytoremediation." Environ Health Perspectives 103.12 (1995): 1106-108.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several chemicals can be targeted for removal including heavy metals (e.g. Mercury and lead) inorganic compounds (e.g. Arsenic and Uranium), and organic compounds (e.g. petroleum and chlorinated compounds like PBC's).&lt;ref&gt;Comis, Don. (2000). "Phytoremediation: Using Plants To Clean Up Soils." Agricultural Research: n. pag. Phytoremediation: Using Plants To Clean Up Soils. USDA-ARS, 13 August 2004. Web. 25 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phytoremeditation is both an environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and energy-efficient measure to reduce pollution. Phytoremediation only costs about $5–$40 per ton of [[soil decontamination|soil being decontaminated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lasat | first1 = M.

(2004). "Junk-greedy Greens: phytoremediation as a new option for soil decontamination,"] BioTech J. '''2''': 61-67&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of this process also reduces the amount of soil that must be disposed of in a hazardous waste landfill.&lt;ref name="phytoremediation1995"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8747015 |pmc=1519251 |year=1995 |author1=Black |first1=H |title=Absorbing possibilities: Phytoremediation |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=103 |issue=12 |pages=1106–8 |doi=10.2307/3432605|jstor=3432605 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban agriculture as a method to mediate chemical pollution can be effective in preventing the spread of these chemicals into the surrounding environment. Other methods of remediation often disturb the soil and force the chemicals contained within it into the air or water. Plants can be used as a method to remove chemicals and also to hold the soil and prevent erosion of contaminated soil decreasing the spread of pollutants and the hazard presented by these lots.&lt;ref name="phytoremediation1995"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/urban.cfm |title=Managing Urban Runoff &amp;#124; Polluted Runoff &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Water.epa.gov |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way of identifying soil contamination is through using already well-established plants as bioindicators of soil health. Using well-studied plants is important because there has already been substantial bodies of work to test them in various conditions, so responses can be verified with certainty. Such plants are also valuable because they are genetically identical as crops as opposed to natural variants of the same species. Typically urban soil has had the topsoil stripped away and has led to soil with low aeration, porosity, and drainage. Typical measures of soil health are microbial biomass and activity, enzymes, [[soil organic matter]] (SOM), total nitrogen, available nutrients, porosity, aggregate stability, and compaction. A new measurement is active carbon (AC), which is the most usable portoin of the total organic carbon (TOC) in the soil. This contributes greatly to the functionality of the soil food web. Using common crops, which are generally well-studied, as bioindicators an be used to effectively test the quality of an urban farming plot before beginning planting. &lt;ref&gt;Alaimo K, Beavers AW, Crawford C, et al. (2016) Amplifying Health Through Community Gardens: A Framework for Advancing Multicomponent, Behaviorally Based Neighborhood Interventions. Current Environmental Health Reports 3:302–312. doi: 10.1007/s40572-016-0105-0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noise pollution===
Large amounts of [[noise pollution]] not only lead to lower property values and high frustration, they can be damaging to human hearing and health.&lt;ref name=pass&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Passchier-Vermeer | first1 = W. | last2 = Passchier | first2 = W.F. | year = 2000 | title = Noise exposure and public health | doi = 10.1289/ehp.00108s1123 | pmid = 10698728 | pmc = 1637786 | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 108 | issue = 1| pages = 123–131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study “Noise exposure and public health,” they argue that exposure to continual noise is a public health problem. They cite examples of the detriment of continual noise on humans to include: “hearing impairment, hypertension and ischemic heart disease, annoyance, sleep disturbance, and decreased school performance.” Since most roofs or vacant lots consist of hard flat surfaces that reflect sound waves instead of absorbing them, adding plants that can absorb these waves has the potential to lead to a vast [[Noise control|reduction in noise pollution]].&lt;ref name=pass /&gt;

===Nutrition and quality of food===
Daily intake of a variety of fruits and vegetables is linked to a decreased risk of chronic diseases including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Urban agriculture is associated with increased consumption of fruits and vegetables &lt;ref name="autogenerated94"&gt;Alaimo, K., Packnett, E., Miles, R., Kruger, D. (2008). "Fruit and Vegetable Intake among Urban Community Gardeners". Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior. (1499-4046),40 (2), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; which decreases risk for disease and can be a cost-effective way to provide citizens with quality, fresh produce in urban settings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foodsecurity.org |author=Bellows, Anne C., Katherine Brown, Jac Smit |title= "Health Benefits of Urban Agriculture" (paper and research conducted by members of the Community Food Security Coalition's North American Initiative on Urban Agriculture) |publisher=Foodsecurity.org |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="autogenerated94"/&gt; Produce from urban gardens can be perceived to be more flavorful and desirable than store bought produce&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.03.044 |pmid=21596466 |pmc=3114166 |title=Connecting food environments and health through the relational nature of aesthetics: Gaining insight through the community gardening experience |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=72 |issue=11 |pages=1853–63 |year=2011 |last1=Hale |first1=James |last2=Knapp |first2=Corrine |last3=Bardwell |first3=Lisa |last4=Buchenau |first4=Michael |last5=Marshall |first5=Julie |last6=Sancar |first6=Fahriye |last7=Litt |first7=Jill S. }}&lt;/ref&gt; which may also lead to a wider acceptance and higher intake. A Flint, Michigan study found that those participating in community gardens consumed fruits and vegetables 1.4 more times per day and were 3.5 times more likely to consume fruits or vegetables at least 5 times daily (p.&amp;nbsp;1).&lt;ref name="autogenerated94"/&gt;  Garden-based education can also yield nutritional benefits in children. An Idaho study reported a positive association between school gardens and increased intake of fruit, vegetables, vitamin A, vitamin C and fiber among sixth graders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jada.2007.01.015 |pmid=17383272 |title=Garden-Based Nutrition Education Affects Fruit and Vegetable Consumption in Sixth-Grade Adolescents |journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association |volume=107 |issue=4 |pages=662–5 |year=2007 |last1=McAleese |first1=Jessica D. |last2=Rankin |first2=Linda L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvesting fruits and vegetables initiates the enzymatic process of nutrient degradation which is especially detrimental to water [[vitamins|soluble vitamin]]s such as [[ascorbic acid]] and [[thiamin]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jsfa.2825 |title=Nutritional comparison of fresh, frozen and canned fruits and vegetables. Part 1. Vitamins C and B and phenolic compounds |journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture |volume=87 |issue=6 |pages=930–44 |year=2007 |last1=Rickman |first1=Joy C |last2=Barrett |first2=Diane M |last3=Bruhn |first3=Christine M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of blanching produce in order to freeze or can reduce nutrient content slightly but not nearly as much as the amount of time spent in storage.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; Harvesting produce from one's own community garden cuts back on storage times significantly.

Urban agriculture also provides quality nutrition for low-income households. Studies show that every $1 invested in a community garden yields $6 worth of vegetables if labor is not considered a factor in investment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt; Many urban gardens reduce the strain on food banks and other emergency food providers by donating shares of their harvest and provide fresh produce in areas that otherwise might be food deserts. The supplemental nutrition program Women, Infants and Children (WIC) as well as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) have partnered with several urban gardens nationwide to improve the accessibility to produce in exchange for a few hours of volunteer gardening work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0002-8223(08)70150-0 |title=Urban Gardening Yields Benefits for Low Income Families |journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association |volume=103 |pages=94–5 |year=2003 |last1=Swartz |first1=S.H. |last2=Ranum |first2=O.J. |last3=Phillips |first3=O.K. |last4=Cavanaugh |first4=J.J. |last5=Bennett |first5=A.E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban farming has been shown to increase health outcomes. Gardeners consume twice as much fruit and vegetables than non-gardeners. Levels of physical activity are also positively associated with urban farming. These results are seen indirectly and can be supported by the social involvement in an individual's community as a member of the community farm. This social involvement helped raised the aesthetic appeal of the neighborhood, boosting the motivation or efficacy of the community as a whole. This increased efficacy was shown to increase neighborhood attachment. Therefore, the positive health outcomes of urban farming can be explained in part due to the interpersonal sand social factors that boost health. Focusing on improving the aesthetics and community relationships and not only on the plant yield, is the best way to maximize the positive effect of urban farms on a neighborhood. &lt;ref&gt;Litt, J.s., et al. “Exploring Ecological, Emotional and Social Levers of Self-Rated Health for Urban Gardeners and Non-Gardeners: A Path Analysis.” Social Science &amp; Medicine, vol. 144, 2015, pp. 1–8., doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.09.004.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy of scale===
Using high-density urban farming, as for instance with [[vertical farms]] or stacked greenhouses, many environmental benefits can be achieved on a citywide scale that would be impossible otherwise. These systems do not only provide food, but also produce potable water from waste water, and can [[recycle]] organic waste back to energy and nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Bosschaert |url=http://www.except.nl/consult/largescaleurbanargriculture/largescaleurbanagriculture1.html |title=Bosschaert, T ''"Large Scale Urban agriculture Essay"'', Except Consultancy, 2007 |publisher=Except.nl |date=15 December 2007 |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, they can reduce food-related transportation to a minimum while providing fresh food for large communities in almost any climate.

===Health inequalities and food justice===
A 2009 report by the USDA, determined that "Evidence is both abundant and robust enough for us to conclude that Americans living in low-income and minority areas tend to have poor access to healthy food", and that the "structural inequalities" in these neighborhoods "contribute to inequalities in diet and diet-related outcomes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=USDA|author2=Economic Research Service|title=Access to Affordable and Nutritious Food: Measuring and Understanding Food Deserts and Their Consequences: A Report to Congress.|journal=Administrative Publication No. (AP-036)|date=June 2009|page=160|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/ap-administrative-publication/ap-036.aspx#.UVH-XehVfog|accessdate=28 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406185309/http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/ap-administrative-publication/ap-036.aspx#.UVH-XehVfog|archive-date=6 April 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These diet-related outcomes, including obesity and diabetes, have become epidemic in low-income urban environments in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Designed for Disease: The Link Between Local Food Environments and Obesity and Diabetes.

Not only can urban agriculture provide healthy, fresh food options, but also can contribute to a sense of community, aesthetic improvement, crime reduction, minority empowerment and autonomy, and even preserve culture through the use of farming methods and heirloom seeds preserved from areas of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultivating Food Justice: Race, Class, and Sustainability |year=2011 |publisher=MIT Press|pages=197–221|author=Teresa M. Mares, Devon G. Pena |editor=Alison Hope Alkon, Julian Agyeman |chapter=Environmental and Food Justice: Toward Local, Slow, and Deep Food Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental justice===
Urban agriculture may advance [[environmental justice]] and food justice for communities living in food deserts.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016" /&gt;  First, urban agriculture may reduce racial and class disparities in access to healthy food. When urban agriculture leads to locally grown fresh produce sold at affordable prices in food deserts, access to healthy food is not just available for those who live in wealthy areas, thereby leading to greater equity in rich and poor neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="MCC"/&gt;
 
Improved access to food through urban agriculture can also help alleviate psychosocial stresses in poor communities. Community members engaged in urban agriculture improve local knowledge about healthy ways to fulfill dietary needs. Urban agriculture can also better the mental health of community members. Buying and selling quality products to local producers and consumers allows community members to support one another, which may reduce stress. Thus, urban agriculture can help improve conditions in poor communities, where residents experience higher levels of stress due to a perceived lack of control over the quality of their lives.&lt;ref name="4Sapolsky"&gt;[[Robert Sapolsky|Sapolsky, Robert]], "Sick of Poverty," Scientific American, Dec. 2005, pp: 93-99.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Urban agriculture may improve the livability and built environment in communities that lack supermarkets and other infrastructure due to the presence of high unemployment caused by [[deindustrialization]]. Urban farmers who follow sustainable agriculture methods can not only help to build local food system infrastructure, but can also contribute to improving local air, and water and soil quality.&lt;ref name="2GOTTLIEB"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/env.2009.0001 |title=Where We Live, Work, Play . . . And Eat: Expanding the Environmental Justice Agenda |journal=Environmental Justice |volume=2 |pages=7–8 |year=2009 |last1=Gottlieb |first1=Robert }}&lt;/ref&gt; When agricultural products are produced locally within the community, they do not need to be transported, which reduces [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|{{CO2}} emission]] rates and other pollutants that contribute to high rates of [[asthma]] in lower socioeconomic areas. Sustainable urban agriculture can also promote worker protection and consumer rights.&lt;ref name="2GOTTLIEB"/&gt; For example, communities in [[New York City]], [[Illinois]], and [[Richmond, Virginia]] have demonstrated improvements to their local environments through urban agricultural practices.&lt;ref name="3ACC"&gt;Alternatives for Community &amp; Environment. Environmental Justice and the Green Economy. A Vision Statement and Case Studies for Just and Sustainable Solutions. Rep. Roxbury, MA: Alternatives for Community &amp; Environment, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
However, urban agriculture can also present urban growers with health risks if the soil used for urban farming is contaminated. Although local produce is often believed to be clean and healthy, many urban farmers ranging from New York urban farmer Frank Meushke &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/garden/14lead.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Murphy, Kate.

Web. 9 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; have found their products contained high levels of [[Lead poisoning|lead]], due to [[soil contamination]], which is harmful to human health when consumed. The soil contaminated with high lead levels often originates from old house paint which contained lead, [[vehicle exhaust]], or atmospheric deposition. Without proper education on the risks of urban farming and safe practices, urban consumers of urban agricultural produce may face additional health-related issues&lt;ref name="MCC"&gt;McClintock, Nathan.

[[File:Foodrooffarm.jpg|thumb|Rooftop urban farming at the Food Roof Farm in downtown St. Louis, MO]]
Creating a community-based infrastructure for urban agriculture means establishing local systems to grow and process food and transfer it from farmer ([[Production, costs, and pricing|producer]]) to [[consumer]].&lt;ref name="Boeing2016" /&gt;

To facilitate food production, cities have established community-based farming projects. Some projects have collectively tended community farms on [[common land]], much like that of eighteenth-century [[Boston Common (park)|Boston Common]]. One such community farm is the [[Collingwood Children's Farm]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. Other community garden projects use the [[allotment garden]] model, in which gardeners care for individual plots in a larger gardening area, often sharing a tool shed and other amenities. Seattle's [[P-Patch]] gardens use this model, as did the [[South Central Farm]] in Los Angeles and the Food Roof Farm in St. Louis. Independent urban gardeners also grow food in individual yards and on roofs. [[Garden sharing]] projects seek to pair producers with the land, typically, residential yard space. [[Roof gardens]] allow for urban dwellers to maintain green spaces in the city without having to set aside a tract of undeveloped land. Rooftop farms allow otherwise unused industrial roofspace to be used productively, creating work and profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/new-york-could-grown-all-its-own-food-180949748/? | title=New York Could Grow All Its Own Food.

[[Food processing]] on a community level has been accommodated by centralizing resources in community tool sheds and processing facilities for farmers to share. The Garden Resource Program Collaborative based in Detroit has cluster tool banks. Different areas of the city have tool banks where resources like tools, [[compost]], mulch, tomato stakes, seeds, and education can be shared and distributed with the gardeners in that cluster. Detroit's Garden Resource Program Collaborative also strengthens their gardening community by providing to their member's transplants; education on gardening, policy, and food issues; and by building connectivity between gardeners through workgroups, potlucks, tours, field trips, and cluster workdays. In Brazil, "Cities Without Hunger" has generated a public policy for the reconstruction of abandoned areas with food production and has improved the green areas of the community.

[[Farmers' market]]s, such as the [[Farmers Market (Los Angeles)|farmers' market in Los Angeles]], provide a common land where farmers can sell their product to consumers. Large cities tend to open their farmer's markets on the weekends and one day in the middle of the week. For example, the farmers' market of [[Boulevard Richard-Lenoir]] in [[Paris, France]], is open on Sundays and Thursdays. However, to create a consumer dependency on urban agriculture and to introduce local food production as a sustainable career for farmers, markets would have to be open regularly. For example, the Los Angeles Farmers' Market is open seven days a week and has linked several local grocers together to provide different food products. The market's central location in downtown Los Angeles provides the perfect interaction for a diverse group of sellers to access their consumers.

===Queensland, Australia===
In Queensland many people have started a trend of urban farming both utilizing [[Aquaponics]] and self-watering containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.futuredirections.org.au/publication/localising-food-production-urban-agriculture-in-australia/ | title=Localising Food Production: Urban Agriculture in Australia| date=2015-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cairo, Egypt===
In Egypt, development of rooftop gardens began in the 1990s. In the early 1990s at [[Ain Shams University]], a group of agriculture professors developed an initiative focused on growing organic vegetables to suit densely populated cities of Egypt. The initiative was applied on a small scale; until it was officially adopted in 2001, by the Food and Agriculture Organization ([[FAO]]).&lt;ref&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

===Havana, Cuba===
[[File:AJM 034 Havana urban agriculture business.JPG|thumb|Farming enterprise in Havana, Cuba (2015)]]

{{main article|Organopónicos}}

After the disintegration of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]], [[Cuba]] faced severe shortages of fuel and [[agrochemical|agrochemical inputs]]. These products had previously been imported from the Soviet Union in exchange for Cuban sugar. As a result, Cubans experienced an acute food crisis in the early 1990s, which in part was met with a popular movement of urban agriculture. Urban farmers employed – and still employ –
[[agroecology|agroecological]] techniques, allowing food production to take place largely without petroleum-based inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10460-015-9659-y |title=Low-carbon food supply: The ecological geography of Cuban urban agriculture and agroecological theory |journal=Agriculture and Human Values |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=771–784 |year=2016 |last1=Cederlöf |first1=Gustav |url=https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/lowcarbon-food-supply(91a7f323-379c-4eeb-b2c8-c6bfe94ea449).html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, {{convert|35000|acre}} of urban gardens produced {{convert|3400000|short ton}} of food. In Havana, 90% of the city's fresh produce come from local urban farms and gardens. In 2003, more than 200,000 Cubans worked in the expanding urban agriculture sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=cubaagriculture.com |url=http://www.cubaagriculture.com/agriculture-today.htm |title=Cuban Ministry of Agriculture |publisher=Cubaagriculture.com |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mumbai, India===
Economic development in [[Mumbai]] brought a growth in population caused mainly by the migration of laborers from other regions of the country. The number of residents in the city increased more than twelve times in the last century. [[Greater Mumbai]], formed by [[South Mumbai|City Island]] and [[Salsette Island]], is the largest city in India with a population of 16.4 million, according to data collected by the census of 2001. Mumbai is one of the densest cities in the world, 48,215 persons per km² and 16,082 per km² in suburban areas. In this scenario, urban agriculture seems unlikely to be put into practice since it must compete with real estate developers for the access and use of vacant lots. Alternative farming methods have emerged as a response to the scarcity of land, water, and economic resources employed in UPA.

Dr. Doshi's city garden methods are revolutionary for being appropriate to apply in reduced spaces as terraces and balconies, even on civil construction walls, and for not requiring big investments in capital or long hours of work. His farming practice is purely organic and is mainly directed to domestic consumption. His gardening tools are composed of materials available in the local environment: sugarcane waste, polyethylene bags, tires, containers and cylinders, and soil. The containers and bags (open at both ends) are filled with the sugarcane stalks, compost, and garden soil, which make possible the use of a minimal quantity of water is compared to open fields. Dr. Doshi states that solar energy can replace soil in cities. He also recommends the idea of chain planning, or growing plants in intervals and in small quantities rather than at once and in large amounts. He has grown different types of fruit such as mangos, figs, guavas, bananas, and sugarcane stalks in his terrace of {{convert|1200|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} in Bandra. The concept of [[city farm]]ing developed by Dr. Doshi consumes the entire household's organic waste. He subsequently makes the household self-sufficient in the provision of food: {{convert|5|kg}} of fruits and vegetables are produced daily for 300 days a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/southasia/ruaf/CD/ho1.html |title=RUAF Foundation. ''Handouts on Case Studies'' |publisher=Iwmi.cgiar.org |date=11 January 2010 |accessdate=1 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718024007/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/southasia/ruaf/CD/ho1.html |archive-date=18 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main objectives of a pilot project at city farm at Rosary High School, Dockyard Road, were to promote economic support for street children, beautify the city landscape, supply locally produced organic food to urban dwellers (mainly those residing in slums), and to manage organic waste in a sustainable city. The project was conducted in the Rosary School, in Mumbai, with the participation of street children during 2004. A city farm was created in a terrace area of {{convert|400|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. The participants were trained in urban farming techniques. The farm produced vegetables, fruits, and flowers. The idea has spread the concept of city farm to other schools in the city.

The Mumbai Port Trust (MBPT) central kitchen distributes food to approximately 3,000 employees daily, generating important amounts of organic disposal. A terrace garden created by the staff recycles ninety percent of this waste in the production of vegetables and fruits. Preeti Patil, who is the catering officer at the MBPT explains the purpose of the enterprise:&lt;ref&gt;Roshni Udyavar et al., "Development of City Farms by Street Children"&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mumbai Port Trust has developed an organic farm on the terrace of its central kitchen, which is an area of approximately {{convert|3000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. The activity of city farming was started initially to dispose of kitchen organic waste in an eco-friendly way. Staff members, after their daily work in the kitchen, tend the garden, which has about 150 plants.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bangkok, Thailand===
In early 2000, urban gardens were started under the direction of the NGO, Thailand Environment Institute (TEI), to help achieve the Bangkok Metropolitan Administrations (BMA) priority to "green" Thailand. With a population of 12 million and 39% of the land in the city vacant due to rapid expansion of the 1960s–80s Bangkok is a test bed for urban gardens centered on community involvement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The two urban gardens initiated by TEI are in Bangkok Noi and Bangkapi and the main tasks were stated as:
* Teach members of the communities the benefits of urban green space.
* Create the social framework to plan, implement, and maintain the urban green space.
* Create a process of a method to balance the needs of the community with the needs of the larger environmental concerns.

While the goals of the NGO are important in a global context, the community goals are being met through the work of forming the urban gardens themselves. In this sense, the creation, implementation, and maintenance of urban gardens are highly determined by the desires of the communities involved. However, the criteria by which TEI measured their success illustrates the scope of benefits to a community which practices urban agriculture. TEI's success indicators were:
* Establishing an Urban Green Plan
* Community Capacity Building
* Poverty Reduction
* Links with Government
* Developing a Model for Other Communities

===China===
Beijing's increase in land area from {{convert|4822|km2}} in 1956 to {{convert|16808|km2}} in 1958 led to the increased adoption of peri-urban agriculture. Such "suburban agriculture" led to more than 70% of non-staple food in Beijing, mainly consisting of vegetables and milk, to be produced by the city itself in the 1960s and 1970s. Recently, with relative food security in China, periurban agriculture has led to improvements in the quality of the food available, as opposed to quantity. One of the more recent experiments in urban agriculture is the Modern Agricultural Science Demonstration Park in Xiaotangshan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jianming | first = Cai | title = Periurban Agriculture Development in China | journal = Urban Agriculture Magazine | volume = 9 | date = 1 April 2003 | url = http://www.ruaf.org/system/files?file=Periurban%20Agriculture%20Development%20in%20China.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 12 July 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195253/http://www.ruaf.org/system/files?file=Periurban%20Agriculture%20Development%20in%20China.pdf | archivedate = 27 September 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Chinese cities have been known to mix agricultural activities within the urban setting. Shenzhen, once a small farming community, is now a fast-growing metropolis due to the Chinese government designation as an open economic zone. Due to large and growing population in China, the government supports urban self-sufficiency in food production. Shenzhen's village structure, sustainable methods, and new agricultural advancements initiated by the government have been strategically configured to supply food for this growing city.&lt;ref name="Pepall, Jennifer 1997"&gt;Pepall, Jennifer. New Challenges for Chinas Urban Farms IDRC Report (1997) 21.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The city farms are located about {{convert|10|km}} from the city center in a two-tier system. The first tier approached from city center produces perishable items. Located just outside these farms, hardier vegetables are grown such as potatoes, carrots, and onions. This system allows producers to be sold in city markets just a few short hours after picking.

Another impressive method used in Chinese agriculture and aquaculture practice is the mulberry-dike fish-pond system, which is a response to waste recycling and soil fertility. This system can be described as:&lt;ref name="Pepall, Jennifer 1997"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mulberry trees are grown to feed silkworms and the silkworm waste is fed to the fish in ponds. The fish also feed on waste from other animals, such as pigs, poultry, and buffalo. The animals, in turn, are given crops that have been fertilized by mud from the ponds. This is a sophisticated system as a continuous cycle of water, waste, and food...with a man built into the picture.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the population grows and industry advances, the city tries to incorporate potential agricultural growth by experimenting with new agricultural methods. The Fong Lau Chee Experimental Farm in Dongguan, Guangdong has worked with new agricultural advancements in lychee production. This farm was established with aspirations of producing large quantities and high-quality lychees, by constantly monitoring sugar content, and their seeds. This research, conducted by local agricultural universities allows for new methods to be used with hopes of reaching the needs of city consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Yeung, Yue-man. Urban Agriculture Research in East and Southeast Asia: Record, Capacities, and Opportunities Cities Feeding People CFP Report 6 (1993) The Chinese University of Hong Kong&lt;/ref&gt;

However, due to increased levels of economic growth and pollution, some urban farms have become threatened. The government has been trying to step in and create new technological advancements within the agricultural field to sustain levels of urban agriculture.

"The city plans to invest 8.82 billion yuan in 39 agricultural projects, including a safe agricultural base, an agricultural high-tech park, agricultural processing and distribution, forestry, eco-agricultural tourism, which will form an urban agriculture with typical Shenzhen characteristics" in conjunction with this program the city is expected to expand the Buji Farm Produce Wholesale Market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.sz.gov.cn/economy/200708/t20070824_229911.htm Shenzhen Government Online Economic Structure: Urban Agriculture 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416053328/http://english.sz.gov.cn/economy/200708/t20070824_229911.htm |date=16 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery the city will invest 600 million yuan on farms located around the city, with hopes of the farms to provide "60 percent of the meat, vegetables, and aquatic products in the Shenzhen market".&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.sz.gov.cn/In/200610/t20061027_148990.htm Shenzhen Government Online SZ farms to feed city residents Local News]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been an emerging trend of going green and organic as a response to pollution and pesticides used in farming practices. Vegetable suppliers are required to pass certain inspections held by the city's Agriculture Bureau before they can be sold as "green".&lt;ref&gt;Shenzhen Government Online Shenzhen store embrace green 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Harare, Zimbabwe===
Harare is particularly suited for urban agriculture, as its topography heavily features ''vleis'', land drainage systems that become waterlogged in the rainy season. When it rains they are difficult to cross, and in the dry season they shrink and crack, which causes structural damage to infrastructure, even though the vleis are still storing water underground. Therefore, these moisture-rich areas are mostly left unbuilt, allowing for urban cultivation.

Aside from vleis and the private residential land that Harareans cultivate, considerable public land is used for agriculture in Harare: along public roads, railway lines, undeveloped plots, road verges, and the banks of ditches.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mudimu|first=Godfrey|date=1996|title=Urban Agricultural Activities and Women's Strategies in Sustaining Family Livelihoods in Harare, Zimbabwe|url=|journal=Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography|volume=17|pages=179–194|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drakakis-Smith|first=David|date=1995|title=Urban Poverty and Urban Agriculture: An Overview of the Linkages in Harare|url=|journal=Habitat International|volume=19|pages=183–193|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land is mostly used for maize, groundnuts, sweet potatoes, green vegetables, fruits, paprika, and flowers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mbiba|first=Beacon|title=City Harvests: Urban and Peri-Urban Agriculture in Harare, Zimbabwe|url=https://www.academia.edu/9507035|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;This unsanctioned cultivation has a history of necessity: in colonial times, laborers wanted towns where they could cultivate crops like at their rural homes, and with very low income, needed to supplement their food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mbiba|first=Beacon|date=1994|title=Institutional Responses to Uncontrolled Urban Cultivation in Harare: Prohibitive or Accommodative?|url=|journal=Environment and Urbanization|volume=6|pages=188–202|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, urban agriculture in Harare causes harm to the environment. The practice has reduced rainwater infiltration into the soil by 28.5 percent and lowered tree species diversity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, most informal urban farmers use harmful chemical fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shingirai|first=Chimbwanda|date=2014-07-25|title=Contribution of urban crop production to household food security: a study of urban agriculture in Warren Park suburb of Harare|url=http://ir.uz.ac.zw/handle/10646/1294?show=full|language=en-ZW}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban agriculture has also been viewed negatively in Harare because it impedes on housing and urban development. In the eyes of Zimbabwean laws, agriculture was not an “urban” activity or a legitimate form of land use in cities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1983, the Greater Harare Illegal Cultivation Committee was formed, though its efforts to curb urban agriculture wholly failed.

In the 1990s, the failure of Structural Adjustment Programs induced greater unemployment, higher prices, and lower incomes, so more people started growing their own food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ruaf.org/sites/default/files/UAM21%20p.26-27.pdf|title=The Impact of the Economic Meltdown on Urban Agriculture in Harare|last=Toriro|first=Percy|date=January 2009|work=Urban Agriculture|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1990 and 1994, Harare's cultivation area increased by 92.6 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286348362|title=CONFLICTS, CONTESTATION, AND MARGINALIZATION IN URBAN AGRICULTURE: EXPERIENCES FROM KUWADZANA EXTENSION, HARARE (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boom in urban agriculture improved both the food security and the nutrition of its practitioners, as well as additional income from selling excess produce. The practice continued in the 2000s when a major recession brought about widespread poverty, unemployment, and enormous inflation. Finally, the 2002 Nyanga Declaration on Urban Agriculture in Zimbabwe explicitly acknowledged the value of urban agriculture for food security and the reduction of poverty.

=== United States ===

==== Nationwide Survey Findings ====
According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], a farm is defined as a location that produces and sells at least $1,000 worth of products. A study conducted on urban farms in 2012 surveyed over 315 farms that identified as urban. Of those, over 32% were found in the Northeast, more than 26% in the South, 22% in the West, and less than 19% in the Midwest. The survey found that most urban farms in the United States are structured as either non-profit or solely owned. Urban farms typically use techniques that allow them to produce intensively on small land. Mainly, these practices include raised beds, greenhouse, and [[container garden]]s. Of the products made, an overwhelming majority of urban farms focus on fresh vegetable, followed by herbs and flowers. If an urban farm focuses on animals, the primary animal is hens. Bees and sheep are the second most common urban farm animals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www. attractive.ncat.org|title=Urban Agriculture in the United States: Baseline Findings of a Nationwide Survey|last=Oberholtzer|first=Lydia|date=November 2016|website=National Center for Appropriate Technology|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021101093149/http://www/|archive-date=1 November 2002|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost half of the urban farms that participated in the survey made a total gross sale adding to less than $10,000. The majority of these sales coming from farmers markets, [[Community-supported agriculture|Community Supported Agriculture]] (CSA), and restaurants. Not even 5% of the urban farms could be considered according to total gross sales statistics. Most urban farms agree on the main challenges that they face; production costs, managing pests, managing weeds, and climate. They also see profitability, financing, and farm labor as big challenges of managing an urban farm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====New York====
[[File:Lower_East_Side_in_Adam_Purple%27s_Garden_1984..jpg|thumb|left|Garden of Adam Purple, lower east-side, New York City, 1984]] Many low-income residents suffer from high rates of obesity and diabetes and limited sources of fresh produce. The City and local nonprofit groups have been providing land, training and financial encouragement, but the impetus in urban farming has really come from the farmers, who often volunteer when their regular work day is done.  In addition, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection offers a grant program for private property owners in combined sewer areas of New York City. The minimum requirement is to manage 1” of stormwater runoff from the contributing impervious area. Eligible projects include green roofs, rooftop farms, and [[rainwater harvesting]] on private property in combined sewer areas. Because of this grant program, New York City now has the world's largest rooftop farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/sustainable-agriculture/rooftop-farm-brooklyn.html|title=One of the world's largest rooftop farms is in Brooklyn|work=TreeHugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some urban gardeners have used empty lots to start a community or urban gardens. However, the soil must be tested for heavy contamination in city soil because of vehicle exhaust and remnants of old construction. The City also has a composting program, which is available to gardeners and farmers. One group, GreenThumb, provides free seedlings. Another program, the City Farms project operated by the nonprofit Just Food, offers courses on growing and selling food.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/07/dining/07urban.html?ex=1210824000&amp;en=9d6a23b0418d45a4&amp;ei=5070&amp;emc=eta1 Urban Farmers' Crops Go From Vacant Lot to Market]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two alternate means of growing are [[rooftop garden]]s and [[hydroponic]] (soil-less) growing. ''The New York Times'' wrote an article about one of Manhattan's first gardens which incorporate both these techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/dining/28roof.html From Roof To Table,]&lt;/ref&gt; Another option urban gardeners have used is Farm-in-A-Box LLC, a company that provides hand-made, ready-to-use garden boxes to residents and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.farminaboxnyc.com/|title=Welcome|website=Farm-In-A-Box|access-date=2016-04-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430091534/http://www.farminaboxnyc.com/|archive-date=30 April 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====California====
In response to the recession of 2008, a coalition of community-based organizations, farmers, and academic institutions in California's [[Pomona Valley]] formed the Pomona Valley Urban Agriculture Initiative.

After the passage of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], cheap grain from the United States flooded Mexico, driving peasant farmers off of their land. Many immigrated to the Pomona Valley and found work in the construction industry. With the 2008 recession, the construction industry also suffered in the region. It is unlikely to regain its former strength because of severe water shortages in this desert region as well as ongoing weakness in the local economy. These immigrants were dry land organic farmers in their home country by default since they did not have access to pesticides and petroleum-based fertilizers. Now, they found themselves on the border of two counties: Los Angeles County with a population of 10 million and almost no farmland, and San Bernardino County which has the worst access to healthy food in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publichealthadvocacy.org|title=California Center for Public Health Advocacy|work=publichealthadvocacy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both counties, there is a growing demand for locally grown organic produce. In response to these conditions, Uncommon Good, a community-based nonprofit organization that works with immigrant farmer families, convened a forum which became the Urban Farmers Association. The Urban Farmers Association is the first organization of its kind for poor immigrant farmers in the Pomona Valley. Its goal is to develop opportunities for its members to support themselves and their families through urban agriculture. With Uncommon Good, it is a founding member of the Pomona Valley Urban Agriculture Initiative (PVUAI). The PVUAI is working with local colleges and universities to expand upon a food assessment survey that was done in the City of Pomona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2006.01.009 |pmid=16627123 |title=Disparities in Access to Fresh Produce in Low-Income Neighborhoods in Los Angeles |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=365–70 |year=2006 |last1=Algert |first1=Susan J. |last2=Agrawal |first2=Aditya |last3=Lewis |first3=Douglas S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oakland====
{{Main article|Urban agriculture in West Oakland}}

[[Urban agriculture in West Oakland]] has taken a radical form that can be traced back to community gardening initiatives starting in the 1970s in the cities of [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], and the city's African-American heritage.&lt;ref name="nm"&gt;McClintock, Nathan. (2011). "Cultivation, Capital, and Contamination: Urban Agriculture in Oakland, California." 2011. PDF file.&lt;/ref&gt; Oakland's manufacturing industry attracted new residents during WWII. To reduce racial tension, the Oakland Housing Authority established housing projects for blacks in West Oakland and whites in East Oakland. With exclusionary [[Covenant (law)|covenants]] and [[redlining]] by banks, development capital was kept out of West Oakland while the African-American population had limited opportunities to rent or buy housing outside West Oakland.&lt;ref name="mc"&gt;McClintock, Nathan. (2008). [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1wh3v1sj From Industrial Garden to Food Desert: Unearthing the Root Structure of Urban Agriculture in Oakland, California.] UC Berkeley: Institute for the Study of Societal Issues.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black Panther Party]] (BPP) played a role in seeding urban agricultural practices in West Oakland.&lt;ref name="nm" /&gt; One of its social programs aimed to improve the access to healthy food for the city's black population by providing breakfast in local schools, churches, and community centers. A small amount of this food came from small local gardens planted by BPP members. According to Prof. Nathan McClintock, "The Panthers used gardening as a coping mechanism and a means of supplementing their diets, as a well as a means to strengthen community members engaged in the struggle against oppression."&lt;ref name="nm" /&gt; The People of Color Greening Network (PCGN) was created in the 1990s. The group planted in empty and vacant lots in West Oakland. In addition, schools around Alameda County began teaching basic gardening skills and food education.&lt;ref name="nm" /&gt; Other groups have carried on those legacies, such as People's Grocery&lt;ref name="js"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10460-012-9363-0 |title=Growing food justice by planting an anti-oppression foundation: Opportunities and obstacles for a budding social movement |journal=Agriculture and Human Values |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=455–66 |year=2012 |last1=Sbicca |first1=Joshua }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Planting Justice.&lt;ref name="sj"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/anti.12247 |title=These Bars Can't Hold Us Back: Plowing Incarcerated Geographies with Restorative Food Justice |journal=Antipode |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=1359–79 |year=2016 |last1=Sbicca |first1=Joshua }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the city of Oakland's Mayor's Office of Sustainability proposed a Sustainable Community Development Initiative towards sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, Ceda [http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oakca/groups/pwa/documents/report/oak025325.pdf "Resolution Authorizing The City Of Oakland To Adopt Part Three Of The 'City Of Oakland Sustainable Community Development Initiative.'”] Oakland City Council Resolution No. 74678. 1 December 1998. PDF file.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to West Oakland's lack of access to nutritious and healthy food, other organizations including the PCGN and City Slicker Farms demanded the plan include strategies for creating a sustainable impact on the local food system. City Slicker Farms was founded in 2001 in response to the lack of access to fresh produce in West Oakland. Through land donations from local residents, a network of urban farms was created through the Community Market Farms Program, and in 2005 the organization established the Backyard Garden Program to aid West Oakland residents in growing their own food at home. This program now grows upwards of 30,000&amp;nbsp; lbs. of food each year.&lt;ref name="csf"&gt;[http://www.cityslickerfarms.org/annual-reports/ "Annual Reports"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023524/http://www.cityslickerfarms.org/annual-reports/ |date=4 March 2016 }} City Slicker Farms. 29 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sc"&gt;[http://www.cityslickerfarms.org/mission-and-history Mission and History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207064950/http://www.cityslickerfarms.org/mission-and-history |date=7 February 2016 }}.

In 2005, Mayor Jerry Brown signed the UN World Environment Day Urban Environmental Accords, pledging Oakland to become a more sustainable city by the year 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/PWA/o/FE/s/SO/a/AdoptedPolicies/index.htm "Adopted Sustainability City Policies."] City of Oakland - Official City Website.

===Canada===

====Montreal====
[[File:Lufa Farms Aerial view of Montreal rooftop greenhouse3.jpg|thumb|[[Lufa Farms]] greenhouses are constructed on the rooftops of [[Greater Montreal]].]]
Canada has a number of companies working on urban farm technology, including [[Lufa Farms]]. In Montreal, there are 97 community gardens which allow citizens space in each plot to grow their plants. The program has been in place since 1975 and is managed by the boroughs. Of the eighteen boroughs, some have a gardening instructor who visits the gardens regularly to give gardeners tips. The soil, a water supply, a space for tools, sand, fencing, and paint are all provided by the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=5977,68887600&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|title=Ville de Montreal - Official city portal - Community gardens|work=montreal.qc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now you can find about 100 [[community gardens]] in Montreal and they have very extensive, well-established, city run community gardening programs. This gardening program is run by the Department of Sports, Recreation and Social Development which provides the garden with the necessities needed for it to run, such as water, maintenance and others. The largest community garden has about 255 allotment plots while the smallest community garden has about 25 plots. 2/3 of the community gardens can be found in parkland zones, which will help prevent development problems in the long run. Out of 2 million people living in the urbanized parts of Montreal, about 10000 of these residents share the garden plots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cosgrove |first1=Sean |title=Community Gardening in Major Canadian Cities: Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver Compared |url=http://www.cityfarmer.org/canadaCC.html |publisher=City Farmer, Canada's Office of Urban Agriculture |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Davidson |first1=Thomas |last2=Krause |first2=Kathryn |title=A Social History of Urban Agriculture in Montreal |url=http://felix.geog.mcgill.ca/other/environ/1999b/food/irp4/history.html#4.0%20Montreal%20Historical%20setting |publisher=McGill |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 19, 2017, an [[IGA (supermarkets)]] located in Saint-Laurent in Montreal unveiled their largest supermarket [[green roof]] to have opened in Canada. They are currently the only grocery store that sells organic produce on their roof. With about 25000 square feet of green space and products certified by Ecocert Canada, they can sell over 30 different kinds of fresh, organic produce. Along with growing vegetables, they are also selling honey produced and harvested by eight Alvéole bee hives which have also made the green roof their home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IGA INTRODUCES THE LARGEST ORGANIC SUPERMARKET GREEN ROOF GARDEN IN THE COUNTRY |url=https://www.iga.net/en/press_room/communiques_2017/iga_introduces_the_largest_organic_supermarket_green_roof_garden_in_the_country |website=IGA |publisher=IGA |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====British Columbia====
A Canadian urban farmer in [[British Columbia]] has published details on a crop value rating (CVR) system that urban farmers can use to determine which [[crop]]s to grow, based on each crop's contribution to supporting the farm economically.&lt;ref name="Stone2016"&gt;{{Citation |last=Stone |first=Curtis A. |year=2016 |title=The Urban Farmer: Growing Food for Profit on Leased and Borrowed Land |publisher=New Society Publishers |url=http://theurbanfarmer.co/ |isbn=978-0865718012 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This entails forgoing some crops in favor of others, but he points out that urban farmers can develop [[business networking]] with rural farmers to bring some of those other crops to the urban point of sale. For example, the urban farmer may not be able to economically justify growing [[sweet corn]] (based on long [[growing degree-day|days to maturity]] and low [[crop yield|yield]] density per linear foot of row), but a networking arrangement is mutually beneficial, as it lets a rural sweet corn grower gain an additional point of sale at [[retail]] price while also letting the urban farmer fill the gap in his product line offering.&lt;ref name="Stone2016"/&gt;

Several community projects in [[Victoria, British Columbia]] were born to promote urban agricultural practices such as the Sharing Backyards program. This program exists to help people living in urban areas get connected with others who have extra space in their yards for the purpose of urban farming. Organizations also exist to educate people living in the urban parts of Vancouver on farming and growing food in an urban setting by running public demonstration gardens.

Covering the roof of the west building of the [[Vancouver Convention Centre]] is the largest green roof in Canada and one of the 10 largest green roofs in the world. With around six acres of living space, it is home to more than 400,000 indigenous plants and grasses that provide [[Thermal insulation|insulation]]. It is also home to four [[Western honey bee]] beehives which pollinate the plants on the roof and provide honey. The living includes other [[sustainable]] practices such as recycling and reusing water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ENVIRONMENT FUNCTIONAL, BEAUTIFUL AND ‘GREEN’ |url=https://www.vancouverconventioncentre.com/about-us/environment |website=Vancouver Convention Centre |publisher=Vancouver Convention Centre |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Kamloops]], in British Columbia, are actively promoting urban agricultural practices within their community. They stress on the importance of food security and its affect on the economy as well as the ecology. They created the Food and Urban Agriculture Plan (FUAP), initiated in 2014, which lays out goals and strategies to implement a [[sustainable]] food system. The Areas which they cover include: Food Production and Land Availability, Food Processing and Preparing, Food Distribution/Retail/Access, Cooking/Eating and Celebrating Food, Food Waste and Resource Management, as well as Education/Governance and Capacity Building. The FUAP greatly emphasizes on Urban Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Food and Urban Agriculture Plan Harvesting Our Potential |url=https://www.kamloops.ca/sites/default/files/docs/city-hall/15-09-food_urban_agriculture_plan_2015_285947.pdf |website=Kamloops |publisher=City of Kamloops |accessdate=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ontario====
Ontario is the second biggest province and has one of the most urbanized cities in Canada, Toronto. The provincial government of Ontario has a website dedicated to providing information to those who are interested in establishing an urban farm or for those who just want to learn more about urban agriculture in Ontario.

UrbanHensTo is a 3-year pilot program that launched in the City of [[Toronto]] on March 2, 2018. This program allows eligible resident in 4 wards across the city to keep a maximum of 4 hens (no roosters) for the purpose of enjoyment or personal consumption of only the eggs. There are other requirements included with rearing these hens under this program such as [[zoning]] and guidelines for building the enclosure, waste and disposal. The wards eligible for this program from the UrbanHensTo site include:
* Ward 13 (Parkdale-High Park)
* Ward 21 (St. Paul's)
* Ward 5 (Etobicoke-Lakeshore)
* Ward 32 (Beaches-East York)
Workshops are also available to those interested in rearing urban hens. However, failure to abide by these rules and regulations can result in fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Urban Hens TO Pilot |url=http://tfpc.to/urbanhensto-pilot |website=TFPC |publisher=Toronto Food Policy Council |accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toronto has a green roof policy and bylaw which has promoted the practice of installing green roofs. According to the Green Roof Industry Survey in 2016, the city was recognized as having the most green roofs installed on buildings in all of North America. This came to be after they developed a green roof strategy in 2009 where new development buildings are required to install a green roof. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Green Roofs |url=https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/official-plan-guidelines/green-roofs/ |website=Toronto |publisher=City of Toronto |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK===
[[Todmorden]] is a town of 17,000 inhabitants in [[Yorkshire]], [[United Kingdom]] with a [[Incredible Edible Todmorden project|successful urban agriculture model]]. The project, which began in 2008, has meant that food crops have been planted at forty locations throughout the town.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2013) [http://orgprints.org/24956/28/24956.pdf  "Please Pick Me" – How Incredible Edible Todmorden is repurposing the commons for open source food and agricultural biodiversity],  In J.

All are "propaganda gardens" promoting locals to consider growing local, to eat seasonal, to consider the provenance of their food, and to enjoy fresh.&lt;ref name="Tod"/&gt; There are food plots in the street, in the health center car park, at the rail station, in the police station, in the cemetery, and in all the town's schools.&lt;ref name="Tod"/&gt;

===Argentina===
The city of [[Rosario]] (population: 1.3 million) has incorporated agriculture fully into its land use planning and urban development strategy. Its Land Use Plan 2007-2017 makes specific provision for the agricultural use of public land. Under its Metropolitan Strategic Plan 2008-2018, Rosario is building a “green circuit”, passing through and around the city, consisting of family and community gardens, large-scale, commercial vegetable gardens and orchards, multifunctional garden parks, and “productive barrios”, where agriculture is integrated into programmes for the construction of public housing and the upgrading of slums. In 2014, the green circuit consisted of more than 30 ha of land used to grow vegetables, fruit and medicinal and aromatic plants. The city has five garden parks – large, landscaped green areas covering a total of 72 ha of land, which are used for agriculture and for cultural, sports and educational activities.&lt;ref&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization (2014) [http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/greenercities/en/GGCLAC/rosario.html Growing greener cities in Latin America and the Caribbean].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
The benefits that UPA brings along to cities that implement this practice are numerous. The transformation of cities from only consumers of food to generators of agricultural products contributes to sustainability, improved health, and poverty alleviation.

* UPA assists to close the open loop system in urban areas characterized by the importation of food from rural zones and the exportation of waste to regions outside the city or town.
* Wastewater and organic solid waste can be transformed into resources for growing agriculture products: the former can be used for irrigation, the latter as fertilizer.
* Vacant urban areas can be used for agriculture production.
* Other natural resources can be conserved. The use of wastewater for irrigation improves [[water management]] and increases the availability of freshwater for drinking and household consumption.
* UPA can help to preserve bioregional ecologies from being transformed into cropland.
* Urban agriculture saves energy (e.g. energy consumed in transporting food from rural to urban areas).
* Local production of food also allows savings in transportation costs, storage, and in product loss, what results in food cost reduction.
* UPA improves the quality of the urban environment through greening and thus, a reduction in pollution.
* Urban agriculture also makes the city a healthier place to live by improving the quality of the environment.
* UPA is a very effective tool to fight against hunger and malnutrition since it facilitates the access to food by an impoverished sector of the urban population.
Poverty alleviation: It is known that a large part of the people involved in urban agriculture is the urban poor. In developing countries, the majority of urban agricultural production is for self-consumption, with surpluses being sold in the market. According to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations), urban poor consumers spend between 60 and 80 percent of their income on food, making them very vulnerable to higher food prices.
* UPA provides food and creates savings in household expenditure on consumables, thus increasing the amount of income allocated to other uses.
* UPA surpluses can be sold in local markets, generating more income for the urban poor.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Community center]]s and gardens educate the community to see agriculture as an integral part of urban life. The Florida House Institute for Sustainable Development in [[Sarasota, Florida]], serves as a public community and education center in which innovators with sustainable, energy-saving ideas can implement and test them. Community centers like Florida House provide urban areas with a central location to learn about urban agriculture and to begin to integrate agriculture with the urban lifestyle.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Smit, Jack, et al. "Urban Agriculture for Sustainable Cities: Using Wastes and Idle Land and Water Bodies as Resources"&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban farms also are a proven effective educational tool to teach kids about healthy eating and meaningful physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;Can a hands-on teaching tool affect students' attitudes and behavior regarding fruit and vegetables? by Lineberger Sarah E. and J. M. Zajicek, HortTechnology 10 (3) 593-596 -2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trade-offs==
* Space is at a premium in cities and is accordingly expensive and difficult to secure.
* The utilization of untreated wastewater for urban agricultural irrigation can facilitate the spread of waterborne diseases among the human population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.agwat.2011.04.005 |title=Urban agriculture, using sustainable practices that involve the reuse of wastewater and solid waste |journal=Agricultural Water Management |volume=98 |issue=9 |pages=1388–94 |year=2011 |last1=Rojas-Valencia |first1=M.N. |last2=Velásquez |first2=M.T. Orta de |last3=Franco |first3=Víctor }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Although studies have demonstrated improved air quality in urban areas related to the proliferation of urban gardens, it has also been shown that increasing urban pollution (related specifically to a sharp rise in the number of automobiles on the road), has led to an increase in insect pests, which consume plants produced by urban agriculture. It is believed that changes to the physical structure of the plants themselves, which have been correlated to increased levels of air pollution, increase plants' palatability to insect pests. Reduced yields within urban gardens decreases the amount of food available for human consumption.&lt;ref name="autogenerated226"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13504509.2011.570803 |title=The effects of air pollution on urban ecosystems and agriculture |journal=International Journal of Sustainable Development &amp; World Ecology |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=226–35 |year=2011 |last1=Bell |first1=J. N.B. |last2=Power |first2=S. A. |last3=Jarraud |first3=N. |last4=Agrawal |first4=M. |last5=Davies |first5=C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Studies indicate that the nutritional quality of wheat suffers when urban wheat plants are exposed to high nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide concentrations. This problem is particularly acute in the developing world, where outdoor concentrations of sulfur dioxide are high and large percentages of the population rely upon urban agriculture as a primary source of food. These studies have implications for the nutritional quality of other staple crops that are grown in urban settings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated226"/&gt;
* Agricultural activities on land that is contaminated (with such metals as lead) pose potential risks to human health. These risks are associated both with working directly on contaminated land and with consuming food that was grown in contaminated soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2012.10.001 |title=Assessing soil lead contamination at multiple scales in Oakland, California: Implications for urban agriculture and environmental justice |journal=Applied Geography |volume=35 |pages=460–73 |year=2012 |last1=McClintock |first1=Nathan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Municipal greening policy goals can pose conflicts. For example, policies promoting urban tree canopy are not sympathetic to vegetable gardening because of the deep shade cast by trees. However, some municipalities like Portland, Oregon, and Davenport, Iowa are encouraging the implementation of fruit-bearing trees (as street trees or as park orchards) to meet both greening and food production goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nordahl|first=Darrin|title=Public Produce: The New Urban Agriculture|year=2009|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington DC|isbn=978-1-59726-588-1}}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wild animal suffering''' is the [[suffering]] experienced by nonhuman animals in nature through causes such as disease, injury, starvation, natural disasters, and killings by other animals.

There is considerable disagreement around this latter point, as many believe that human intervention in nature would be either unethical, unfeasible, or both.

== Extent of suffering in nature ==

In his [[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin|autobiography]], [[Charles Darwin]] acknowledged that the existence of extensive suffering in nature was fully compatible with the workings of natural selection, yet maintained that [[Reinforcement#Reinforcement|pleasure]] was the main driver of fitness-increasing behavior in organisms.&lt;ref name=Darwin1993 /&gt; Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] challenged Darwin's claim in his book ''[[River Out of Eden]]'', wherein he argued that wild animal suffering must be extensive due to the interplay of the following evolutionary mechanisms:

* [[Gene-centered view of evolution|Selfish genes]] – genes are wholly indifferent to the well-being of individual organisms as long as DNA is passed on.
	 
* [[Struggle for existence|The struggle for existence]] – competition over limited resources results in the majority of organisms dying before passing on their genes.
	 
* [[Malthusian catastrophe|Malthusian checks]] – even bountiful periods within a given ecosystem eventually lead to overpopulation and subsequent population crashes.
From this, Dawkins concludes that the natural world must necessarily contain enormous amounts of animal suffering as an inevitable consequence of [[Natural selection|Darwinian evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dawkins|first1=Richard|title=River Out of Eden|date=1995|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0-465-01606-5|chapter=Chapter 4: God's Utility Function}}&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate this he wrote:[[File:Mouse litter.jpg|thumb|A litter of [[House mouse|mice]] with their mother. The reproduction of mice follows an ''r''-selection strategy, with many offspring, short gestation, less parental care, and a short time until sexual maturity.]]&lt;blockquote&gt;The total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation. During the minute that it takes me to compose this sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive, many others are running for their lives, whimpering with fear, others are slowly being devoured from within by rasping parasites, thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation, thirst, and disease. It must be so. If there ever is a time of plenty, this very fact will automatically lead to an increase in the population until the natural state of starvation and misery is restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=River Out of Eden: A Darwinian View of Life|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=9781857994056|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Building on this, others have argued that the prevalence of [[r-selection|r-selected animals]] in the wild indicates that the average life of a wild animal is likely to be very short and end in a painful death. According to this view, the average life of a wild animal should thus contain more suffering than happiness, since a painful death would outweigh any short-lived moments of happiness in their short lives.&lt;ref name="Horta2010a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horta|first=Oscar|title=Debunking the Idyllic View of Natural Processes: Population Dynamics and Suffering in the Wild|journal=Télos|year=2010|volume=17|issue=1|pages=73–88|url=https://www.academia.edu/2290959/Debunking_the_Idyllic_View_of_Natural_Processes_Population_Dynamics_and_Suffering_in_the_Wild}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sagoff1984" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ng1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ng|first=Yew-Kwang|authorlink1=Yew-Kwang Ng|title=Towards Welfare Biology: Evolutionary Economics of Animal Consciousness and Suffering|journal=Biology and Philosophy|year=1995|volume=10|issue=3|pages=255–285|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00852469|doi=10.1007/BF00852469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Bambi or Bessie: Are Wild Animals Happier?'' Christie Wilcox argues that wild animals do not appear to be happier than domestic animals, based on findings of wild animals having greater levels of cortisol and elevated stress responses relative to domestic animals. Additionally, unlike domestic animals, animals in the wild do not have some of their needs provided for them by human caretakers.&lt;ref name="Bambi or Bessie"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilcox|first=Christie|title=Bambi or Bessie: Are Wild Animals Happier?|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2011/04/12/bambi-or-bessie-are-wild-animals-happier/|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=8 May 2016|date=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welfare economist [[Yew-Kwang Ng]] has written that evolutionary dynamics can lead to animal welfare which is worse than necessary for a given population equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Ng1995" /&gt;

==Philosophical status==

=== History of concern for wild animals ===
In the essay 'On Nature', [[utilitarian]] philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] wrote about suffering in nature and the normativity of struggling against it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In sober truth, nearly all the things which men are hanged or imprisoned for doing to one another, are nature's every day performances. [...] The phrases which ascribe perfection to the course of nature can only be considered as the exaggerations of poetic or devotional feeling, not intended to stand the test of a sober examination. No one, either religious or irreligious, believes that the hurtful agencies of nature, considered as a whole, promote good purposes, in any other way than by inciting human rational creatures to rise up and struggle against them.
[...] Whatsoever, in nature, gives indication of beneficent design proves this beneficence to be armed only with limited power; and the duty of man is to cooperate with the beneficent powers, not by imitating, but by perpetually striving to amend, the course of nature - and bringing that part of it over which we can exercise control more nearly into conformity with a high standard of justice and goodness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=On Nature |url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mill-john-stuart/1874/nature.htm |accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The English writer and naturalist [[Henry Stephens Salt]] wrote an entire chapter on the plight of wild animals, 'The Case of Wild Animals', in his 1894 book [[Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress]]. Salt wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is of the utmost importance to emphasize the fact that, whatever the legal fiction may have been, or may still be, the rights of animals are not morally dependent on the so-called rights of property; it is not to owned animals merely that we must extend our sympathy and protection. [...]
To take advantage of the sufferings of animals, whether wild or tame, for the gratification of sport, or gluttony, or fashion, is quite incompatible with any possible assertion of animals' rights.&lt;ref name="animal-rights-library.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress |url=http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-c/salt01.htm |accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Salt argued that humans are justified in killing wild animals in self-defense, but that "[...] we are not justified in unnecessarily killing—still less in torturing—any harmless beings whatsoever." He argues that this applies to insects as well: "We are unable to give life, and therefore ought not to take it away from the meanest insect without sufficient reason.'"&lt;ref name="animal-rights-library.com"/&gt;

In 1991, the environmental philosopher [[Arne Naess (philosopher)|Arne Naess]] critiqued what he termed the "cult of nature" of contemporary and historical attitudes of indifference towards suffering in nature. He argued that we should confront the reality of the wilderness and that we should be prepared to disturb natural processes when feasible to relieve suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naess|first1=Arne|title=Should We Try to Relieve Clear Cases  of Suffering in Nature?|journal=Pan Ecology|date=1991|volume=6|pages=1–5|url=https://www.abolitionist.com/reprogramming/suffering-nature.pdf|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecology as intrinsically valuable ===

[[Holmes Rolston III]] argues that only unnatural animal suffering is a morally bad thing and that humans do not have a duty to intervene in natural cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rolston III|first1=Holmes|title=Environmental Ethics: Duties To and Values in the Natural World|date=1988|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=9780877225010|url=https://www.amazon.com/Environmental-Ethics-Duties-Values-Natural/dp/0877226288|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He celebrates carnivores in nature because of the significant ecological role they play. Others have argued that the reason that humans have a duty to protect other humans from predation is because humans are part of the cultural world rather than the natural world and so different rules apply to them in these situations.&lt;ref name=Hettinger1994&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hettinger|first=Ned|title=Valuing Predation in Rolston's Environmental Ethics|journal=Environmental Ethics|year=1994|volume=16|issue=1|pages=3–20|doi=10.5840/enviroethics199416138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moriarty1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moriarty|first=Paul|author2=Mark Woods |title=Hunting ≠ Predation|journal=Environmental Ethics|year=1997|volume=19|issue=4|pages=391–404|doi=10.5840/enviroethics19971945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that prey animals are fulfilling their natural function, and thus flourishing, when they are preyed upon or otherwise die, since this allows natural selection to work.&lt;ref name=Aaltola2010 /&gt;

=== Wild animal suffering as a ''reductio ad absurdum'' ===

That people would also be obliged to intervene in nature has been used as a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' against the position that animals have rights.&lt;ref name=Simmons2009 /&gt; This is because, if animals such as prey animals did have rights, people would be obliged to intervene in nature to protect them, but this is claimed to be absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benatar|first=David|authorlink1=David Benatar|title=Why the Naïve Argument against Moral Vegetarianism Really is Naïve|journal=Environmental Values|date=February 2001|volume=10|issue=1|pages=103–112|doi=10.3197/096327101129340769|jstor=30301788}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ebert|first=Rainer|title=Innocent Threats and the Moral Problem of Carnivorous Animals|journal=Journal of Applied Philosophy|year=2012|volume=29|issue=2|pages=146–159|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5930.2012.00561.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-5930.2012.00561.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; An objection to this argument is that people do not see intervening in the natural world to save other people from predation as absurd and so this could be seen to involve treating non-human animals differently in this situation without justification.&lt;ref name=Horta2010c&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horta|first=Oscar|title= Disvalue in nature and intervention|journal=Pensata Animal|year=2010|volume=34|url=https://www.academia.edu/download/7822811/DisvalueNatureIntervention.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relevance to the theological problem of evil ===
{{Main|Problem of evil#Problem of evil and animal suffering}}

The [[problem of evil]] has been extended beyond human troubles to include the suffering of animals over the course of evolution.&lt;ref name=Creeganp44&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan|title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB1pAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-993185-9 |pages=44–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interventions to reduce suffering ==

=== Arguments for intervention ===
Some theorists have reflected on whether we should accept the harms that animals suffer in nature or try to do something to mitigate them.&lt;ref name="Horta2010a" /&gt; The moral basis for interventions aimed at reducing wild animal suffering can be rights-based or welfare-based. From a rights-based perspective, if animals have a moral right to life or bodily integrity, intervention may be required to prevent such rights from being violated by other animals.&lt;ref name=Aaltola2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaltola|first=Elisa|authorlink1=Elisa Aaltola|title=Animal Ethics and the Argument from Absurdity|journal=Environmental Values|date=February 2010|volume=19|issue=1|pages=79–98|doi=10.3197/096327110X485392|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/whp/ev/2010/00000019/00000001/art00006|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a welfare-based perspective, a requirement to intervene may arise insofar as it is possible to prevent some of the suffering experienced by wild animals without causing even more suffering.&lt;ref name="Policing Nature" /&gt; Advocates of intervention in nature argue that nonintervention is inconsistent with either of these approaches. Some proposed courses of action include removing predators from wild areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacAskill|first1=William|last2=MacAskill|first2=Amanda|title=To Truly End Animal Suffering, the Most Ethical Choice is To Kill Wild Predators (Especially Cecil the Lion)|url=http://qz.com/497675/to-truly-end-animal-suffering-the-most-ethical-choice-is-to-kill-all-predators-especially-cecil-the-lion/|publisher=Quartz|accessdate=17 April 2016|date=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grush|first1=Loren|title=Killing off wild predators is a stupid idea|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/10/9308195/killing-off-wild-predators-is-a-stupid-idea|website=The Verge|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; refraining from reintroducing predators,&lt;ref name=Sagoff1984 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Horta2010b&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horta|first=Oscar|title=The Ethics of the Ecology of Fear against the Nonspeciesist Paradigm A Shift in the Aims of Intervention in Nature|journal=[[Between the Species]]|year=2010|volume=13|issue=10|pages=163–187|url=http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1114&amp;context=bts|doi=10.15368/bts.2010v13n10.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing medical care to sick or injured animals,&lt;ref name=Pearce2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="Policing Nature" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reese|first1=Jacy|title=Wild animals endure illness, injury, and starvation.

=== The practicality of intervening in nature ===

A common objection to intervening in nature is that it would be impractical, either because of the amount of work involved, or because the complexity of ecosystems would make it difficult to know whether or not an intervention would be net beneficial on balance.&lt;ref name=McMahan2010&gt;{{cite news|last=McMahan|first=Jeff|title=Predators: A Response|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/predators-a-response/?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=27 December 2013|date=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Simmons argues that we should not intervene to save animals in nature because doing so would result in [[unintended consequences]] such as damaging the ecosystem, interfering with human projects, or resulting more animal deaths overall.&lt;ref name=Simmons2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simmons|first=Aaron|title=Animals, Predators, The Right to Life and The Duty to Save Lives|journal=Ethics &amp; The Environment|year=2009|volume=14|issue=1|doi=10.2979/ete.2009.14.1.15| pages=15–27|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/een/summary/v014/14.1.simmons.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Peter Singer]] has argued that intervention in nature would be justified if one could be reasonably confident that this would greatly reduce wild animal suffering and death in the long run. In practice, however, Singer cautions against interfering with ecosystems because he fears that doing so would cause more harm than good.&lt;ref name=Singer1973&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singer|first1=Peter|title=Food for Thought|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1973/jun/14/food-for-thought/|journal=[[The New York Review of Books]]|accessdate=23 February 2015|date=June 14, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Singer2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singer|first1=Peter|title=The Point of View of The Universe|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199603695|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors dispute Singer's empirical claim about the likely consequences of intervening in the natural world, and argue that some types of intervention can be expected to produce good consequences overall. Economist [[Tyler Cowen]] cites examples of animal species whose extinction is not generally regarded as having been on balance bad for the world. Cowen also notes that, insofar as humans are already intervening in nature, the relevant practical question is not whether we should intervene at all, but what particular forms of intervention we should favor.&lt;ref name="Policing Nature"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowen|first=Tyler|title=Policing Nature|journal=Environment Ethics|year=2003|volume=25|issue=2|pages=169–182|doi=10.5840/enviroethics200325231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher Oscar Horta similarly writes that there are already many cases in which we intervene in nature for other reasons, such as for human interest in nature and environmental preservation as something valuable in their own rights.&lt;ref name=Horta2010a&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horta|first=Oscar|title=Debunking the Idyllic View of Natural Processes: Population Dynamics and Suffering in the Wild|journal=Télos|year=2010|volume=17|issue=1|pages=73–88|url=https://www.academia.edu/2290959/Debunking_the_Idyllic_View_of_Natural_Processes_Population_Dynamics_and_Suffering_in_the_Wild}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, moral philosopher [[Jeff McMahan (philosopher)|Jeff McMahan]] argues that, since humans "are already causing massive, precipitate changes in the natural world," we should favor those changes that would promote the survival "of herbivorous rather than carnivorous species."&lt;ref name=McMahan2010 /&gt;

[[Peter Vallentyne]] suggests that, while humans should not eliminate predators in nature, they can intervene to help prey in more limited ways. In the same way that we help humans in need when the cost to us is small, we might help some wild animals at least in limited circumstances.&lt;ref name=Verchot2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Verchot|first1=Manon|title=Meet the people who want to turn predators into vegans|url=http://www.treehugger.com/natural-sciences/meet-the-people-who-want-to-turn-predators-into-vegans.html|accessdate=2 October 2014|agency=TreeHugger|date=30 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential conflict between animal rights and environmentalism ===

It has been argued that the common environmentalist goal of preserving the natural order is not in line with the goal of looking after the welfare of sentient animals.&lt;ref name=Belshaw&gt;{{cite book|last=Belshaw|first=Christoher|title=Environmental Philosophy|year=2001|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=1-902683-21-8|page=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been further argued that they conflict in different cases. Examples include environmentalists supporting hunting invasive species for population control while animal rights advocates oppose it;&lt;ref name=Horta2010d&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horta|first1=Oscar|title=What Is Speciesism?|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics|year=2010|volume=23|issue=3|pages=243–266|url=http://masalladelaespecie.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/whatisspeciesism.pdf|doi=10.1007/s10806-009-9205-2|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; animal rights advocates arguing for the extinction or reengineering of carnivores or ''r'' strategist species while deep ecologists defend their right to be and flourish as they are;&lt;ref name=Pearce2009&gt;{{cite web|last=Pearce|first=David|title=Reprogramming Predators|year=2009|url=http://www.hedweb.com/abolitionist-project/reprogramming-predators.html|publisher=HEDWEB|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; animal rights advocates defending the reduction of wildlife areas or arguing against their expansion out of concern that most animal suffering takes place in them while environmentalists want to safeguard and expand the wild.&lt;ref name=Sagoff1984&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sagoff|first=Mark|title=Animal Liberation and Environmental Ethics: Bad Marriage, Quick Divorce|journal=Osgoode Hall Law Journal|year=1984|volume=22|issue=2|pages=297–307|url=http://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1936&amp;context=ohlj}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hettinger1994/&gt;

=== History of interventions ===
In 2016, 350 starving [[hippo]]s and [[African buffalo|buffalo]]es at [[Kruger National Park]] were killed by park rangers. One of the motives for the action was to prevent the animals from suffering as they died.&lt;ref name="krugercull"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burke|first1=Jason|title=South African national park to kill animals in response to severe drought|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/south-african-national-park-kill-animals-severe-drought|website=The Guardian|accessdate=20 November 2016|date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
