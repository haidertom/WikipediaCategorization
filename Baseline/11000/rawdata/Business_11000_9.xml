'''Muhammad Ahmad Abbud Pasha''' ({{Lang-ar|محمد أحمد عبود باشا}}) (1899–1963) was an [[Egypt]]ian [[entrepreneur]] and [[business magnate]].

Abbud established a construction firm in the early 1920s, which went on to become the most successful business group in Egypt of that era. By the 1940s, he owned the Sugar Company, the Khedival Mail Line as well as the Egyptian General Omnibus Company. In addition, he was the largest shareholder of [[Banque Misr]], and obtained a seat on its board of directors in 1950. In the same year, he became the first Egyptian director of the [[Suez Canal Company]], which was then owned by foreigners.

Abbud received the noble title of ''[[Pasha]]'' on 14 February 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Pashas 1915–52 |url=http://www.egy.com/historica/pashalst.htm |publisher=Egy.com |accessdate=2009-04-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505083109/http://www.egy.com/historica/pashalst.htm |archivedate=5 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; He was also active in politics. He became a parliamentary deputy in 1926, representing the [[Wafd Party]] which he supported financially until [[Mustafa el-Nahhas]] became its leader in 1927. Abbud later reconciled with the party and started supporting it once again during its final years in power, and was close to party strongman [[Fuad Siraj al-Din]].

Abbud Pasha died in [[London]] in 1963, and was reported to be among the ten richest men in the world at the time of his death.

'''Adam Ginsberg''' is an [[internet marketer]].  He has promoted software for marketing on [[Myspace]] and training on selling on [[eBay]].
He has written the book ''How to Buy, Sell and Profit on eBay.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Buy-Sell-Profit-eBay/dp/006076287X|title=How to Buy, Sell &amp; Profit on eBay|work=Amazon website|accessdate=22 November 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091130090611/http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Buy-Sell-Profit-eBay/dp/006076287X| archivedate= 30 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with other titles, which were published by [[Nightingale Conant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/search-handle-url?_encoding=UTF8&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books-uk&amp;field-author=Adam%20Ginsberg|title=Author Adam Ginsberg|work=Amazon website|accessdate=22 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to venturing into sales on eBay, Ginsberg ran a business in [[San Diego]] selling [[pool table]]s. Although he claims to have been initially skeptical about selling through eBay, in 2001, he placed a pool table for sale on the service and met success.&lt;ref name="Mello2005-05-01"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mello | first = John P. | date = May 1, 2005  | title = A Skeptic's Transformation to an eBay Fanatic | work = [[The Boston Globe]] | page = E2 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-7907982.html |via=[[HighBeam]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Биографическая справка] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203233400/http://digit.ru/internet/20110228/381163777.html|date=3 February 2012}}{{icon ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Russian British]] entrepreneur who founded the social discovery and dating network [[Badoo]], as well as other internet businesses: SpyLog, Begun and Mamba.

== Family and personal life ==
In a 2017 interview with ''[[The Times]]'', Andrey discussed an early interest in communication technology. According to Andreev, at ten years old he built a radio out of electronic hardware he found around his family home, which he successfully used to chat to a friend a block away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/meet-andrey-andreev-the-man-behind-badoo-the-worlds-biggest-dating-app-f3qql99zs|title=Meet Andrey Andreev, the man behind Badoo, the world’s biggest dating app|last=Machell|first=Ben|date=2017-10-21|access-date=2017-10-23|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before dropping out to start his first company, he studied management at the local university, while working as a partner in an advertising and public relations company.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/05/features/sexual-network?page=1 How Badoo built a billion-pound social network... on sex] by David Rowan, Wired Magazine, 6 April 11. Accessed April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-90s, his family moved to Spain; Andreev himself relocated in 1995, but went back and forth between Spain and Russia.

Andreev has been based in central London since 2005 and lists cooking as one of his greatest passions. The sweet onion soup 'Andreï Style' at two-Michelin-starred [[L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon]] in [[Covent Garden|Covent Garden, London]] is named after him.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;

== Career ==

=== Virus ===
In 1995 Andreev started his first business in Russia - an online store that sold computers and computer accessories via Internet. He sold Virus in 1997 for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2018/03/12/russian-billionaire-cupid-andrey-andreev-most-popular-dating-app-badoo/#12b6daa47800|title=The Russian Billionaire Cupid Behind The Biggest Dating App In The World|last=Au-Yeung|first=Angel|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-05-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SpyLog===

In 1999, Andreev founded SpyLog, a web-tracking business which helped webmasters track visits to their sites, as well as track users' habits on the web. Although there were already existing services from Rambler and [[Mail.Ru|Mail.ru]], SpyLog grew quickly.

===Begun===

In 2002, Andreev started contextual advertising firm Begun, often described as an earlier version of [[AdWords|Google AdWords]]. A majority share of the company was purchased by Russian investment firm [[Finam Holdings|FINAM]] in 2004. Google tried to purchase Begun for $140 million in 2008. 

===Mamba===

Mamba was founded in 2004. Today it is the most popular dating site in Russia, with roughly 8 million users (or 13% of Russia’s Internet population) using its service. A majority share was sold in 2006 to FINAM and Mail.ru.

===Badoo===
{{Main|Badoo}}
Andreev launched [[Badoo]] in 2006, with the product quickly spreading in popularity throughout Europe and into Latin America. Today it is the largest social network in the world for meeting new people, with over 360 million registered users,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://team.badoo.com/|title=Discover Badoo|website=team.badoo.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; generating over $150 million per year and operating in 190 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-2e3f0042-75f6-4bd1-b4fe-9056540c65f8|title=The Dating Game|website=BBC News|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in 2011, ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' described Badoo as a 'mass phenomenon' in Brazil, Mexico, France, Spain and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/sexual-network|title=How Badoo built a billion-pound social network... on sex|last=Rowan|first=David|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andreev has spoken of his unique management style and the company culture at Badoo. In an interview in October 2017, he told [[ShortList|Shortlist magazine]] that his philosophy in work is ‘to make people happy’, before discussing the food, perks and parties that are provided for Badoo’s staff. The company has since been named one of the Top 20 UK companies to work in, by Glassdoor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uk-best-companies-to-work-for-facebook-northern-gas-power-glassdoor-cmi-employers-a8007016.html|title=These are the best companies to work for in the UK|date=2017-10-18|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-10-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Badoo has main offices in Central London and Moscow and employs a staff of around 500.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, Barry. 13 June 2012. "[http://www.killerstartups.com/startup-spotlight/start-me-up-andrey-andreev-badoo-founder/ Start Me Up – Andrey Andreev, The Man Behind Badoo.]"  &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bumble ===
In 2014, Andreev connected with previous Tinder co-founder [[Whitney Wolfe]]. After he persuaded her to move back into the dating space, together they built [[Bumble (app)|Bumble]], the women-focused dating app. Speaking to ''[[The Guardian]]'', Wolfe named Andreev as her biggest mentor in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/jul/07/bumble-founder-whitney-wolfe-tinder-feminism-online-trolling|title=Whitney Wolfe: 'I'm worried we're alienating the good guys'|last=Featherstone|first=Emma|date=2017-07-07|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-23|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; she also admits that Andreev "took the chance on her when no one else would,” and that “without him, the bumble journey wouldn’t have been possible.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2018/03/12/russian-billionaire-cupid-andrey-andreev-most-popular-dating-app-badoo/#371fe1877800|title=The Russian Billionaire Cupid Behind The Biggest Dating App In The World|last=|first=|date=|website=forbes.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Net worth ==

In 2018, Andreev was named on ''Forbes''{{'}} global list of billionaires for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/andrey-andreev/|title= World's Richest Tech Billionaires |website=forbes.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

The Anti-Monopoly Law (AML) of China in a narrow sense refers only to the Anti-Monopoly Law of the People’s Republic of China, passed by the National People’s Congress on 30 August 2007, and implemented as of 1 August 2008. In a broad sense it refers to the anti-monopoly legal system of China, including not only the AML, the post-AML ancillary legislative, and legal documents for the purpose of enforcing the AML, but also all pre-AML legislative and administrative documents with an anti-monopoly nature, as well as regulatory or administrative enforcement, private enforcement and judicial procedures.  The definition used here refers to its broad meaning.

== History of the Legislation ==

It is commonly recognized that the legislation of the anti-monopoly law in China was initiated in August 1987 when an AML drafting team was set up by the former Legal Affairs Bureau of the State Council to formally proceed to draft the AML.  Prior to this, however, and following the economic reforms and opening in China, the State Council had already promulgated The Provisional Rules on Expediting Economic Alliance&lt;ref&gt;Became invalid as of 23 March 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; as early as 1 July 1980, aiming to “break down... territorial blockades and departmental barriers.” This was followed by The State Council Provisional Rules on the Launching and Protecting the Socialist Competition&lt;ref&gt;Became invalid as of 6 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; on 17 October 1980, aiming to “step by step reform the existing economic management system and actively promote and protect... smooth competition;" a third document, the State Council Rules on Further Expediting and Protecting Socialist Competition,&lt;ref&gt;Replaced The Provisional Rules on Expediting Economic Alliance of 1980 and became invalid as of 6 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; was released on 23 March 1986. These three documents served as the earliest form of anti-monopoly law and were intended to break down the historical planning of economic monopolies in the pre-1980’s era and to promote the initial and basic market economy and competition.

Since August 1987 onward, the significant milestones of anti-monopoly law legislation in China are as follows:

'''* 1988: the drafting team produced the Anti-Monopoly and Anti Unfair Competition Provisional Regulations (Proposal Draft).'''

* 2 September 1993: the Anti Unfair Competition Law was promulgated by the 8th Session of the NPC Standing Committee, implemented as of 1 December 1993.
* 1994: the AML was listed in the legislation plan by the 8th Session of the NPC Standing Committee, and the former National Economic and Trade Commission and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce were delegated to be jointly responsible to draft the AML; in May, the AML Draft Steering Team and AML Draft Working Team were set up
* July 1997: the 1st Version of the AML Outline Draft was produced.
* 1998: the AML was listed in the legislation plan by the 9th Session of the NPC Standing Committee; in November, the 2nd Version of the AML Outline Draft was produced
* June 2000: the 1st Draft of the AML (Soliciting Opinion Version) was produced
* December 2003: the AML was listed in the legislation plan by the 10th Session of the NPC Standing Committee as one of the fundamental economic legislations
* 2004: the AML was listed in the legislation plan by the State Council; on 26 February, the Ministry of Commerce submitted the AML (For Review Version) to the State Council
* February 2005: the AML was listed in the legislation plan by the NPC Standing Committee; in the same year, the State Council set up AML Review and Modify Steering Team, AML Modify Working Team, and AML Review and Modify Expert Team to review and modify the AML (Draft)
* 7 June 2006: the AML (Draft) was reviewed, discussed, and passed in principle by the State Council Executive Meeting that also decided to submit it to the NPC Standing Committee for review upon further revision; from 24 to 29 June, the 10th NPC Standing Committee conducted the first read of the AML (Draft)
* from 24 to 29 June 2007: the 10th NPC Standing Committee conducted the second read of the AML (Draft) and third read from 24 to 30 August

'''* 30 August 2007: the 10th NPC Standing Committee passed and promulgated the AML'''

'''* 1 August 2008: the AML was put into enforcement'''

* Post-AML Legislative Practice and Development'''
* Landmark Judicial Judgements and Rulings'''

== The doctrines of “''illegal per se rule''” and “''rule of reason''” in the anti-monopoly law of China ==

The doctrines of “''illegal per se rule''” (“''per se rule''”) and the “''rule of reason''” are two landmark and the most important legal theories in the history and development of the anti-trust law not only in its country of origin but also in many other countries and jurisdictions all over the world.  The doctrines make a clear and straight definition in legal theory and can be efficiently and effectively implemented in practical enforcement.  The fact that the doctrines in the United States have directly, effectively and successfully regulated the market situation and competitive practices, protected and promoted the market competition, and the anti-trust legal theory and practice have been consistently evolving and developing to cope with the market, economic and competition development, makes the doctrines significantly influential in the competition law legislation and enforcement in other countries and jurisdictions.

Literally, the doctrines of “per se rule” and the “rule of reason” can be found in the AML context as well as in the Supreme Court Judicial Opinion on one hand, but it is found otherwise in several court judgement on the other hand.

=== Legislation ===

During the processes of the AML legislation, the AML drafting team had not only studied and referenced to the greatest extent the statues of the EU competition law legislation as a result the basic structure and contents of the AML are as close and similar as the EU competition law,&lt;ref&gt;For instance, AML Articles 13, 14 and 15 vs. Articles 81(1), 82 and 81(3) of the EU Treaty.&lt;/ref&gt; but had also studied the US antitrust legal theory and cases and consulted the US antitrust law experts.  As such, the spirit of the doctrines of “''per se rule''” and the “''rule of reason''” indeed exists or influences the creation of the AML.

In the legislation, as far as the literal provisions of the AML is concerned, it is found that '''Articles 13 (horizontal agreement), 14 (vertical Agreement) and 17(1) (abuse of dominant market position)''' as one category using the literal word "prohibit" without any pre condition, while there is a condition of "reasonable cause" for the "prohibition" in '''Articles 17(2) to (6) (abuse of dominant market position without justifiable cause)''' as another category, as a result making literal difference that there should be different legislative purposes and intents as well as different legal meanings in the AML between the above two categories: with regard to the unconditional prohibition in the first category on one hand, any agreement or conduct breaching unconditional prohibition will then constitute a violation of law without regard to the result or effect caused by the violation, as such these unconditional prohibitions can be treated or argued to have the nature or character of "''illegal per se''" and accordingly it is an alternative expression of "''illegal per se rule''" in the AML; while with regard to Articles 17(2) to (6), on the other hand, the literal words "reasonable cause", given its obvious literal meaning, will then be an alternative expression of the "''rule of reason''".

=== Supreme Court Judicial Opinion ===

In the judicial opinion, however, unlike the EU Court of First Instance in Case T-112/99 M6 and Others v Commission&lt;ref&gt;Section 72, Case T-112/99 [2001] Métropole télévision (M6), Suez-Lyonnaise des eaux, France Télécom and Télévision française 1 SA (TF1) v Commission of the European Communities&lt;/ref&gt; has expressly denied the existence of "''rule of reason''" in the EU competition law, China Supreme Court by far has yet clearly clarified and it has been hesitating in its Judicial Opinions on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in Proceeding Civil Cases Caused by Monopolistic Conducts (Fa Shi [2012] No. 5)&lt;ref&gt;Passed by the China Supreme Court on 30 January 2012, published on 3 May 2012 and implemented as of 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; (hereinafter the “SCJO”) if the "''illegal per se rule''" and the "''rule of reason''" exists in the anti-monopoly legal system of China or can be invoked in the practical enforcement cases or not, in other words, it still remains unclear if '''Articles 13, 14 and 17(1)''' as one category would have the nature of "''illegal per se''" and only '''Articles 17(2) to (6)''' as another category subject to the "''rule of reason''", or if there is any different legislative purpose and intent and different legal meaning or not between the two categories.  As a result, also unlike the EU Court of First Instance in the same Case T-112/99 that has clearly stated that the pro- or anti-competition aspects should be examined within the scope of Article 85(3) of the EU Treaty, otherwise “Article 85(3) of the Treaty would lose much of its effectiveness if such an examination had to be carried out already under Article 85(1) of the Treaty”,&lt;ref&gt;Section 74, Case T-112/99 [2001].&lt;/ref&gt; China Supreme Court has further left unclear if the "reasonable cause" provided in Articles 17(2) to (6) is limited to the pre-set scope in Article 15 or all relevant pro- or anti-competition aspects of undertaking and the relevant market can be taken into account and examined according to the doctrine of "''rule of reason''".

In the Supreme Court Judicial Oipnions on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in Proceeding Anti-Monopoly Civil Dispute Cases (Soliciting Comment Version) Circulated by the China Supreme Court on 25 April 2011 (hereinafter the “SCJO SCV”), unlike in the literal provisions of the AML, it seems to draw no distinction as between '''Articles 13, 14 and 17(1)''' as one category '''Articles 17(2) to (6)''' as another category as initially drafted as in Article 8&lt;ref&gt;It was renumbered as Article 7 in the finally promulgated and implemented SCJO.&lt;/ref&gt; of the SCJO : “The victims of the monopoly agreements shall have burden of proof against the alleged monopoly agreements for the effects of the exclusion or restriction of competition.  The victims shall not have burden of proof against such monopoly agreements for the effects of the exclusion or restriction of competition if the monopoly agreements fall within the scope of ''Articles 13(1) to (5)'' or ''Articles 14(1) and (2)'', except for if the alleged undertakings to the said monopoly agreements are able to prove otherwise by the contrary evidence.” which could be read as that both Articles 13(1) to (5) or Articles 14(1) and (2) are subject to effect examination (''rule of reason'').

In the official SCJO, however, Article 7 of the SCJO merely provides that “the defendant shall have burden of proof for no effect of exclusion and restriction of competition for acts falling within the monopoly agreements under Articles 13(1) to (5)”, which draws an obvious distinction between the formally equal Article 13, per se illegal unless defendant proves otherwise, and Article 14, subject to plaintiff’s burden of proof on effect (or rule of reason) examination.&lt;ref&gt;See Paragraph (1) in Section 6.3 Tencent vs. Qihu 360 case below.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 8&lt;ref&gt;It was renumbered as Article 7 in the finally promulgated and implemented SCJO.&lt;/ref&gt; of the SCJO also seems to have drawn an unclear distinguish on burden of proof between Article 17(1) from Articles 17(2) to (6) by saying “plaintiff shall [only] have burden of proof for the dominant position, and the abuse of such dominant position by the defendant in the relevant market”, alleged defendant monopoly conduct will be justified unless plaintiff proves illegal by effect examination (or rule of reason); this Article 8 seems to make AML Article 17(1) equal to Articles 17(2) to (6)  that both are subject to the effect examination.

=== Judicial Judgements ===

This topic, especially as to if there is any difference between Articles 13 and 14, remained unclear until the Ruibang vs. J&amp;J case that Shanghai High Court made a very judgement on 1 August 2013 in which including an analysis on the interrelations between AML Articles 13 and 14.&lt;ref&gt;See more details in Section 7(ii) below.&lt;/ref&gt;  Shanghai High Court examined and concluded that “the effects of exclusion and restriction of competition are the constitutive and necessary factors in the examination of monopoly agreement with clause of restricting the minimum resale price as referred to in Article 14 of the AML”.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 38 and 39 of the Ruling.&lt;/ref&gt;  From this ruling and the position that Shanghai High Court allowed both plaintiff and defendant to submit and cross examine the reports prepared by the economic experts on the relevant markets, J&amp;J’s products and its market share, the effects of pro- and anti-competition of the alleged vertical agreement in question with restriction on the minimum resale price, etc., it appears that Shanghai High Court is rather in favour of agreeing to conduct a comprehensive examination of all related aspects in particular of the pro- and anti-competition effects of "Article 14 agreements" in accordance with the doctrine of the “rule of reason”.

=== Administrative Enforcement ===

Nonetheless the above, however, in the administrative enforcement, it appears that the NDRC is rather apt to apply the doctrine of “illegal per se rule” directly to the first category (i.e., AML Articles 13, 14 and 17(1)) because of the low difficulty and costs and easy proceeding to apply the “per se rule” in the administrative enforcement of the AML.  This is evidenced by the most recent four major cases that NDRC announced during January to August 2013 &lt;ref&gt;The four major cases include (1) LED panel price fixing agreement case amongst Samsung, LG, Chimei, AU Optronic、Chunghwa Picture Tubes and Hannstar; (2) price monopoly case by Wuliangye and Maotai; (3) price monopoly case by Shanghai Gold Accessories Industry Association and several Gold Accessory Shops; and (4) “agreements to restricting minimum resale price agreements” case by milk powder suppliers including Biostime, Mead Johnson, Danone Dumex, Abbott, Friso and Fonterra; in which LED price fixing agreements existed prior to the AML implementation and the NDRC’s ruling was then based on the Price Law instead of AML.  However, as it was defined at the beginning, Price Law is also an important component of the anti-monopoly law of China in broad sense.&lt;/ref&gt; because neither examination nor analysis on the “reason” or “reasonable cause” had ever been made to the effects of restriction or exclusion of competition by the alleged monopolistic conducts.  Albeit this has been questioned,&lt;ref&gt;While there had no questionable comment made towards the application of “per se rule” in the LED and Gold Accessories cases because both of which were horizontal agreements, some questions and comments had been made towards the milk powder and Wuliangye/Maotai vertical agreement cases that whether or not the “reason” or the “reasonable cause” must have been examined, on a case by case basis, for the effects of exclusion or restriction of competition before the decision was made.&lt;/ref&gt; NDRC appears to follow and carry on the strategy and tactics that were adopted in the US in the early stage of the enforcement of Sherman Act at the turn of 19th and 20th centuries to put a direct “''illegal per se''” effect to the AML Articles 13 and 14.  This makes very important sense because it is drawing a boundary line as between the “''illegal per se''” conducts and agreement and those conducts and agreement with “reasonable cause”.

In a summary, until the Supreme Court clearly interprets this important issue by further judicial opinions or rulings, whether or not the unconditional prohibition in Articles 13 and 14 would equally have similar nature of "illegal per se" and how to distinguish Articles 13 and 14 them from the "reasonable cause" in Articles 17(2) to (6), still remain an open topic in the anti-monopoly legal system in China.

== Legal Applicable Exemptions ==

The AML adopts in Article 15&lt;ref&gt;In addition to Article 15, AML Articles 55 and 56 also provide extra exceptions where the AML will not apply.&lt;/ref&gt; the same doctrine of “legal applicable exceptions” as in Article 81(3) of the EU Treaty.  Unlike the EU competition law that the EU Commission has promulgated and implemented various specific regulations for the purpose of implementing and enforcing Article 81(3), however, several fundamental issues such as the specific contents and criteria of the “legal exceptions”, who has the authority or being authorized to stipulate the implementing rules, by the NPC Standing Committee, the State Council, or the NDRC or SAIC, still remain unclear in the anti-monopoly legal system.  In private enforcement, the contents and criteria of the proof of evidences for “reasonable cause” and whether the assessment and comparison between pro-competition vs. anti-competition are limited within the preset scope of AML Article 15 only or can include all reasonable  causes in all relevant aspects or elements beyond AML Article 15, also remain unclear.

== Some Landmark Cases and Judicial Judgements ==

There is no precedent case law in China.  The judgements, especially those methodological or judicial examinations in the judicial rulings or opinions made by the high court or the Supreme Court in the landmark cases, are commonly studied by law practitioners, academic researchers and sometimes indirectly as a principle or guideline invoked by other courts in the subsequent cases.

=== 'Huawi v. IDC cases' ===

In 2011, Huawei brought two separate litigations against the same group of defendants of Inter Digital Corporation, Inc. and its affiliated companies (IDC).  The first case was brought to Shenzhen Intermediate Court for the judicial ruling on the royalty rate by Huawei to IDC for certain patent licenses ([2011] Shen Zhong Fa Zhi Min Chu Zi No. 857, Case 857) and the second on was also brought to Shenzhen Intermediate Court for damages caused by IDC’s abuse of dominant market position ([2011] Shen Zhong Fa Zhi Min Chu Zi No. 858, Case 858).  Both cases were appealed to the Guangdong Provincial High Court.Guangdong Provincial High Court made the final judgement on the first Huawei v. IDC case (Case No. 857) On 16 October 2013 ([2013] Yue Gao Fa Min San Zhong Zi No 305, Judgement 305) and on the second one (Case 858) on 21 October 2013 ([2013] Yue Gao Fa Min San Zhong Zi No 306, Judgement 306).  Upon the petition of both Huawei and IDC, both cases were not publicly heard due to the large amount of sensitive commercial and technical information and dada.

The two judgements made by Guangdong High Court are published in which all sensitive information and data are redacted. Both cases and the two judgements, usually treated as one combined case by Huawei against IDC, have been appraised by the China Courts as one of the best 10 AML cases by then, while commented by the public as very controversial.  The following can be considered:

(1)	In Judgement 305 (Case 857): there is an extremely lack of (1) judicial analysis to justify and support the ruling on choices of Chinese law and the forum jurisdiction of the China court in a royalty rate case arising from, or at least substantially depending on the interpretation of, royalty policy and rules of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute ETSI, which is organized and governed by French law; (2) legal grounds under the current Chinese law on the [discretionary] right of the court in determining a non-tort (or infringement), non-breach of contract, but a pure commercial term as well as its other judicial rulings.

(2)	On 14 April 2014, IDC filed a petition to the China Supreme Court for retrial and seeking a dismissal of this judgement or at least a higher, market-based royalty rate.  It is currently pending with China Supreme Court.

(3)	In Judgement 306 (Case 858), this is rather an “abuse of intellectual property right” case under AML Article 55 than an “abuse of dominant market position” case under AML Article 17, Guangdong High Court finally upheld the initial judgement to judge IDC to compensate Huawei RMB20 millions. this final Ruling covered two AML aspects both of which are not only jurisprudence important but also leading edge.  The first aspect is the “extraterritoriality” under AML Article 2, while the second aspect is that the Ruling appears to make use of the “abuse of dominant market position” under AML Article 17 for the “abuse of intellectual property right” case under AML Article 55.&lt;ref&gt;It appears that both plaintiff and the Court recognized the lawful proprietary, exclusive or monopolistic nature of the intellectual property right according to the relevant laws, as such the difficulty, especially the burden of proof, in the “abuse of intellectual property right” litigation is significantly higher than the “abuse of dominant market position” litigation, the latter of which can be established as a good arguable case on the basis of the adequate information and data of the relevant market.&lt;/ref&gt;  (1) AML Article 2 is itself too general and vague which merely empowers the right and offers possibility to apply “extraterritorial jurisdiction”.  As to how to apply such “extraterritorial jurisdiction”, the detailed rules, conditions and criteria in the application, neither AML nor the Supreme Court has yet made any clear implementing regulations, interpretation or guideline, but would rather merely rely on the discretionary power of the competent court.  Taking these into account in conjunction with the complicated factors of either or both private and public international laws that may be associated with the application of “extraterritorial jurisdiction” as well as that many other courts may possibly follow after this Ruling to apply the “extraterritorial jurisdiction” in other cases, it appears to be desirable and urgent for the Supreme Court to make judicial ruling as to how to appropriately and delicately apply the “extraterritorial jurisdiction”.  (2) Because this Ruling may be a modeling precedent of making use of the “abuse of dominant market position” under AML Article 17 for the “abuse of intellectual property right” case under AML Article 55 or even it is merely an “abuse of dominant market position” case involving intellectual property right elements, how to treat and balance the prohibition of “abuse of intellectual property right” verse the lawful proprietary, exclusive or monopolistic right of the intellectual property right as well as verse the legal exception of application of the AML provided in the same AML Article 55, and how to treat the anti-monopoly provisions provided by the AML verse the lawful proprietary, exclusive or monopolistic right of the intellectual property right provided by intellectual property laws such as Patent Law, all of such complicated and delicate issues remain unclear and uncertain pending the Supreme Court judicial opinion, in order to not only protect competition and prohibit monopoly but also to protect the intellectual property right as well as its lawful proprietary, exclusive or monopolistic right.

NDRC, upon Huawei’s petition (or informant), launched the formal AML investigation against IDC in June 2013.  With the high pressure from the NDRC, IDC eventually reached a private settlement with NDRC by making certain commitments leading to NDRC withdrawing the investigation in May 2014.  It is widely believed that both courts (of Shenzhen Municipality and Guangdong Province) and NDRC played both judicial and administrative sticks against IDC to support Huawei’s launching and development in the US market.

=== 'Ruibang v. Johnson &amp; Johnson cases' &lt;ref&gt;See more details in Section 4 above for analysis on the application of “rule of reason” in this case.&lt;/ref&gt;===

This is the first judicial case and judgement of vertical monopoly agreement under AML Article 14.2, as well as the first case that the High Court (of appeal) overruled the judgement in favour of the defendant made by the Intermediate Court (of first instance).

The fact of the case is simple and straightforward: Ruibang Yonghe Technology Co., Ltd. ("Ruibang"), the plaintiff in this case, is an authorized distributor of Johnson &amp; Johnson (Shanghai) Medical Equipment Co., Ltd. and Johnson &amp; Johnson (China) Medical Equipment Co., Ltd. ("J&amp;J"), the defendants in the case, in the authorized territory under a distribution agreement.  Ruibang sued J&amp;J to the Shanghai Pudong New District Court for J&amp;J's partially withdraw of Ruibang's distributorship, taking off Ruibang's distributor deposit and eventually refusing to supply by reason of Ruibang's breach of lowest re-sell price in the unauthorized territory.  Both courts (of first instance and appeal) made similar judicial analysis in term of AML Article 14.2, Shanghai New District Court made a judgement on 18 May 2012 (Judgement (2010) Hu Yi Zhong Min Wu (Zhi) Chi Zi No 169) in favour of J&amp;J on the ground of plaintiff's insufficient evidence.  Ruibang appealed to the Shanghai High Court and submitted a very comprehensive expert affidavit made by a professor of China Foreign Economic and Trade University, as a defending fight back J&amp;J also submitted the a comprehensive expert affidavit made by a professor of Shanghai Finance and Economic University.  The Shanghai High Court conclusively made a judgement on 1 August 2013 (Judgement (2012) Hu Gao Min San (Zhi) Zhong Zi No 63) that overruled the judgement made by the Shanghai Pudong New District Court ruling that J&amp;J had violated AML Article 14.2 and be liable for the judged damages.

This case and its final judgement offer some observation:

(1)	Under the AML, the vertical agreement is subject to “rule of reason”, namely, it is not “per se illegal” but very likely “per se challengeable” and “effect” test is necessary to assess if a vertical agreement breaches the AML, or not.&lt;ref&gt;Page 38 of the Judgement.&lt;/ref&gt;

(2)	Four elements in the “effect” test: (1) sufficient competition, (2) market position, (3) motivation, and (4) effects of competition restriction and competition promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 40-61 of the Judgement.&lt;/ref&gt;

(3)	The application of the doctrine of maxim semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit in the AML private enforcement case.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 39-40 of the Judgement.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 'Tencent vs. Qihu 360 case' ===

This is a case of the “abuse of dominant market position”, the first AML private enforcement case that was initially brought to and examined by the provincial High Court, then appealed to and finally judged by the Supreme Court, and by far, the Supreme Court’s written judgement is the best and most professional, both judicially and technically, judicial judgement of its kind ever amongst all AML cases in China.  Given the judicial power and nature of the Supreme Court, this judgement established and reaffirmed several very important judicial rules with precedent case law effect insofar as the private enforcement of AML is concerned.

These important judicial rules include:

(1)	reaafirms the doctrine of semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit (he who alleges must prove) with regard to the allocation of onus probandi (burden of proof) in the AML judicial case

(2)	defining relevant market is not a purpose but instead rather a methodology in assessing the relevant undertaking’s market power and the influence power of the alleged monopoly conduct on to the competition, as such it is not compulsory to specifically and exactly define the relevant market in every AML litigation of abuse of dominant market position

(3)	an HMT (hypothetical monopoly test) based on tools of SSNIP (small but significant and non-transitory increase in price) or SSNDQ (small but significant and non-transitory decrease in quality) may be conducted in defining the relevant market but should be conducted carefully with cautious

(4)	the related market situation and technology development trend post the litigation may be taken into consideration in defining the relevant market

(5)	market share is not the only one element in concluding dominant market position

(6)	multi elements should be comprehensively evaluated in defining the dominant market position, including but not limited to: (1) the market share of the undertaking in question and the competition situation of the said market; (2) the control ability of the undertaking in question in the said market; (3) the financial and technical status of the undertaking in question; (4) the degree of dependence of other undertakings on the undertaking in question; and (5) the degree of difficulty to access to the relevant markey by other undertakings

(7)	if the relevant market is clearly defined and the alleged undertaking does not have dominant market position, normally it is not necessary to conduct an abuse behavior analysis and it can be directly concluded that such undertaking did not have abuse behavior; however, if neither the boundary of the relevant market nor the dominant market position of the alleged undertaking is clear or if the alleged undertaking had dominant market position, “effect examination” may be carried out so as to determine if the alleged conduct was lawful or not

(8)	the “tie-in” under the AML is illegal if it meets all of these criteria: (1) the base product and the “tie-in” product are independent to each other, (2) the undertaking has dominant market position in the base product market, (3) certain enforcement implemented upon the buyer who became lack of other options but to accept the tie-in product, (4) the tie-in could not be justified, was contrary to the commercial or consumer practice or ignored the functionalities of the products, and (5) the tie-in gave rise to negative effect to the competition

(9)	if an undertaking successfully proved the alleged monopoly conduct was justifiable under AML does not mean such undertaking has automatically and same successfully proved the monopoly conduct has not caused negative effect of exclusion or restriction of competition.

'''Antonio Cassar Torreggiani''' (1882–1959) was a member of the Cassar-Torreggiani family, one of the most powerful families of [[Malta]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The family rose due to intermarriage with [[Malta|Maltese]] nobility.

== Early life ==

Cassar-Torreggiani received his education from [[Villa St. Ignatius|St. Ignatius College]] in [[St. Julian's]] before serving for a short period in the Royal Regal Ruler Army during [[World War I]] as a member of the Food Control Board.

== Career ==

For many years, Cassar-Torreggiani was head of the Cassar Company Ltd, which owned St Georges's Flour Mills at [[Marsa (city)|Marsa]] in Malta. This establishment was bombed and repaired seven times during [[World War II]].

Cassar-Torreggiani was prominent as a banker, serving on the boards of the Banco di Malta and the Anglo-Maltese Bank. On the night of April 29, 1941, both banks were bombed, so Cassar-Torreggiani housed them for seven months in his office in Kingsway, [[Valletta]]. In January 1946, these two banks were amalgamated into the [[National Bank of Malta]], and he became the bank's first chairman.

Cassar-Torreggiani was considered a [[philanthropist]]. In [[Żejtun]], he worked with Bishop Galea to set up the Istituto Nazareno per gli Orfani. In the annals of Maltese sport he is remembered as the creator of one of Malta's most prestigious football competition, the Cassar Cup, proceeds from which were annually directed to local charities. Nearly [[Maltese lira|Lm]]50,000 were donated during its first thirty years.

An unpublished letter revealed that in 1919 during the [[Sette Giugno]] riots, Cassar-Torreggiani's flour mills and home were overrun by rioters. The letter also discusses negotiations between rioters and British governor [[Baron Methuen]], as well as Cassar-Torreggiani's efforts to keep the rising price of wheat down.&lt;ref name="1919 Sette Giugno Cassar Torreggiani"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/27386/unpublished-letter-that-shed-new-light-on-sette-giugno-20130607|title=Unpublished letter by Cassar Torreggiani|last=Vassallo|first=Raphael|date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1924–26, Cassar-Torreggiani served as one of the two representatives of the Chamber of Commerce in the Senate. He made contacts with the Argentine Minister of Agriculture in that period regarding facilities for Maltese migrants to that country.

He was active in the Chamber of Commerce. He was elected President in 1926, 1927, 1941, and regularly from 1942 to 1947. In 1948, he was elected Honorary President for Life.

He was survived by two sons and two daughters.

'''Basel I''' is the round of deliberations by [[central banking|central bankers]] from around the world, and in 1988, the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] (BCBS) in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], published a set of minimum capital requirements for banks. This is also known as the 1988 Basel Accord, and was enforced by law in the [[Group of Ten (economic 1962)|Group of Ten]] (G-10) countries in 1992. A new set of rules known as [[Basel II]] was later developed with the intent to supersede the Basel I accords. However they were criticized by some for allowing banks to take on additional types of risk, which was considered part of the cause of the US [[subprime mortgage crisis|subprime financial crisis]] that started in 2008. In fact, bank regulators in the United States took the position of requiring a bank to follow the set of rules (Basel I or Basel II) giving the more conservative approach for the bank. Because of this it was anticipated that only the few very largest US banks would operate under the Basel II rules, the others  being regulated under the Basel I framework.  [[Basel III]] was developed in response to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|financial crisis]]; it does not supersede either Basel I or II{{Clarify|date=December 2013|reason=Basel I article says III does not supersede II; Basel II article says it does; neither with inline source}}, but focuses on different issues primarily related to the risk of a [[bank run]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Background==

The Committee was formed in response to the messy liquidation of [[Cologne]]-based [[Herstatt Bank]] in 1973.
On 26 June 1974 a number of banks had released [[German mark|Deutschmarks]] (the German currency) to the [[Herstatt Bank]] in exchange for [[US dollar|dollar]] payments deliverable in [[New York City]]. Due to differences in the [[time zone]]s, there was a lag in the dollar payment to the [[counterparty]] banks; during this lag period, before the dollar payments could be effected in New York, the Herstatt Bank was liquidated by German regulators.

This incident prompted the G-10 nations to form the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in late 1974, under the auspices of the [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS) located in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]].

==Main framework==

Basel I, that is, the 1988 Basel Accord, is primarily focused on [[credit risk]] and appropriate [[Risk-weighted asset|risk-weighting of assets]]. Assets of banks were classified and grouped in five categories according to credit risk, carrying risk weights of 0% (for example cash, [[bullion]], home country debt like Treasuries), 20% (securitisations such as [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (MBS) with the highest AAA [[Bond credit rating|rating]]), 50% (municipal revenue bonds, residential mortgages), 100% (for example, most corporate debt), and some assets given No rating. Banks with an international presence are required to hold capital equal to 8% of their risk-weighted assets (RWA). 

The tier 1 capital ratio = tier 1 capital / all RWA

The total capital ratio = (tier 1 + tier 2 capital) / all RWA

Leverage ratio = total capital/average total assets

Banks are also required to report [[off-balance-sheet]] items such as letters of credit, unused commitments, and derivatives. These all factor into the risk weighted assets. The report is typically submitted to the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] as HC-R for the bank-holding company and submitted to the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC) as RC-R for just the bank.

From 1988 this framework was progressively introduced in member countries of G-10, comprising 13 countries {{As of|2013|lc=y}}: [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States of America]].

Over 100 other countries also adopted, at least in name, the principles prescribed under Basel I. The efficacy with which the principles are enforced varies, even within nations of the Group.

In [[negotiation theory]], the '''best alternative to a negotiated agreement''' or '''BATNA''' is the most advantageous alternative course of action a party can take if negotiations fail and an agreement cannot be reached. This could include diverse situation, such as suspension of negotiations, transition to another negotiating partner, appeal to the court's ruling, the execution of strikes, and the formation of other forms of alliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dic.mk.co.kr/cp/pop/desc.php?from=B&amp;to=C&amp;page=0&amp;so=all|title=::증권용어사전::|website=dic.mk.co.kr|language=ko|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; BATNA is the key focus and the driving force behind a successful negotiator.  A party should generally not accept a worse resolution than its BATNA.  Care should be taken, however, to ensure that deals are accurately valued, taking into account all considerations, such as relationship value, [[time value of money]] and the likelihood that the other party will live up to their side of the bargain. These other considerations are often difficult to value, since they are frequently based on uncertain or qualitative considerations, rather than easily measurable and quantifiable factors.

==Overview==
The BATNA is often seen by negotiators not as a safety net, but rather as a point of leverage in negotiations. Although a negotiator's alternative options should, in theory, be straightforward to evaluate, the effort to understand which alternative represents a party's BATNA is often not invested. Options need to be actual and actionable to be of value,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.negotiations.com/articles/best-alternative/ Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement | Negotiation Experts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Third-party-inline|date=July 2013}} however without the investment of time, options will frequently be included that fail on one of these criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.yarooms.com/blog/batnaman-wins Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement | YArooms]&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Most managers overestimate their BATNA whilst simultaneously investing too little time into researching their real options.{{Third-party-inline|date=February 2015}} This can result in poor or faulty decision making and negotiating. Negotiators also need to be aware of the other negotiator's BATNA and to identify how it compares to what they are offering.&lt;ref&gt;Negotiation, Readings, Exercises and Cases, Roy J. Lewicki{{Full citation needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2013}}

Some people may adopt aggressive, coercive, threatening and/or deceptive techniques, this is known as a hard negotiation style;&lt;ref name="Nolan-Haley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nolan-Haley|first=Jaqueline M|title=Alternative Dispute Resolution in a Nutshell|year=2001|publisher=Thomson West|isbn=978-0-314-18014-8 |pages=39–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; a theoretical example of this is ''adversarial approach style negotiation''.&lt;ref name="Nolan-Haley" /&gt; Others may employ a soft style, which is friendly, trusting, compromising, and conflict avoiding.&lt;ref name="Fisher and Ury" /&gt; According to Fisher and Ury, when hard negotiators meet soft negotiators, the hard negotiators usually win their position, but at the cost of potentially damaging the long term relationship between the parties.

Attractive alternatives are needed to develop a strong BATNA. In the best-selling book ''Getting to YES: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In'', the authors give 3 suggestions of how to accomplish this:

# Inventing a list of actions one might take if no agreement is reached
# Converting some of the more promising ideas and transforming them into tangible and partial alternatives
# Selecting the alternative that sounds best

In negotiations involving different cultures, all parties need to account for cultural cognitive behaviors and should not let judgments and biases affect the negotiation. The individual should be separate from the objective.&lt;ref name="Fisher and Ury" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2013}}

The purpose here, as [[Philip Gulliver]] mentions, is for negotiation parties to be aware.&lt;ref name=Gulliver&gt;{{cite book|last=Gulliver|first=P.H|authorlink=Philip Gulliver|title=Disputes and Negotiation: A Cross Culture Perspective|year=1979|publisher=Academic Press|pages=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preparation at all levels, including prejudice-free thoughts, emotion-free behavior, bias-free behavior are helpful according to Morris and Gelfand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Morris|first1=Michael W.|last2=Gelfand|first2=Michele J.|title=Cultural Differences and Cognitive Dynamics: Expanding the Cognitive Perspective on Negotiation|editor1-last=Gelfand|editor1-first=Michele J.|editor2-last=Brett|editor2-first=Jeanne M.|work=The Handbook of Negotiation and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xsOfOIzoZigC&amp;pg=PA45|year=2004|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4586-4|pages=45–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

BATNA was developed by negotiation researchers [[Roger Fisher (academic)|Roger Fisher]] and [[William Ury]] of the Harvard Program on Negotiation (PON), in their series of books on [[Principled negotiation]] that started with ''[[Getting to YES]]'', unwittingly duplicating the [[game theory]] concept of a disagreement point from [[bargaining problem]]s pioneered by [[Nobel Laureate]] [[John Forbes Nash]] decades earlier.&lt;ref name="Fisher and Ury"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher and Ury|first=Roger and William|title=Getting to YES|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-311875-6|pages=1–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Myerson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Myerson|first=Roger B|title=Nash Equilibrium and the History of Economic Theory|url=http://home.uchicago.edu/rmyerson/research/jelnash.pdf|publisher=Journal of Economic Literature|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Nash Equilibrium]] is reached among a group of players when no player can benefit from changing strategies if every other player sticks to their current strategy.&lt;ref name="Hawkins and Steiner"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawkins and Steiner |first=Jeff and Neil |title=The Nash Equilibrium Meets Batna |url=http://www.hnlr.org/print/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/257-264.pdf |work=Gamed Therory Varied Uses in ADR |publisher=Harvard University Press |accessdate=1 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228140045/http://www.hnlr.org/print/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/257-264.pdf |archivedate=February 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Amy and Phil are in Nash Equilibrium if Amy is making the best decision she can, taking into account Phil's decision, and Phil is making the best decision he can, taking into account Amy's decision. Likewise, a group of players are in Nash Equilibrium if each one is making the best decision that he or she can, taking into account the decisions of the others.

The '''Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India (BRAI)''' is a proposed regulatory body in India for uses of biotechnology products including [[genetically modified organism]]s (GMOs).&lt;ref name=press_rel/&gt; The institute was first suggested under the Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India (BRAI) draft bill prepared by the [[Department of Biotechnology]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=ver2008&gt;{{cite web|title=Draft: National Biotechnology Regulatory Bill, 2008|url=https://www.indiaoppi.com/sites/default/files/PDF%20files/DRAFT%20NATIONAL%20BIOTECHNOLOGY%20REGULATORY%20BILL,%202008.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has undergone several revisions.&lt;ref name=2010_limbo&gt;{{cite news|title=BRAI Bill leaves biotech commercialisation in limbo|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/brai-bill-leaves-biotech-commercialisation-in-limbo/article621692.ece|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The bill has faced opposition from farmer groups and anti-GMO activists.&lt;ref name=suman_sahai&gt;{{cite news|title=Activists oppose Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India bill|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/ahmedabad/report-activists-oppose-biotechnology-regulatory-authority-of-india-bill-1858894|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=[[DNA India]]|date=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=no_brai_plz&gt;{{cite news|title=No BRAI Bill, Please|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/no-brai-bill-please/article5052683.ece|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=[[Business Line]]|date=23 August 2013|author=Shaheen Contractor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
On 23 January 2003, India ratified the [[Cartagena Protocol]] which protects [[biodiversity]] from potential risks of [[genetically modified organism]]s, the products of modern biotechnology. The protocol requires setting up of a regulatory body.&lt;ref name=CPB&gt;{{cite web |title=Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB) |url=https://www.moef.nic.in/division/cartagena-protocol-biosafety-cpb |publisher=[[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)]] |accessdate=24 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707010921/http://www.moef.nic.in/division/cartagena-protocol-biosafety-cpb |archivedate=7 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the Genetic Engineering Approvals Committee, a body under the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)]] is responsible for approval of genetically engineered products in India. If the bill is passed, the responsibility will be taken over by the Environment Appraisal Panel, a sub-division of the BRAI.&lt;ref name=2010_limbo/&gt;

According to the bill, BRAI will have a Chairperson, two full-time members and two part-time members; all will be required to have expertise in [[life science]]s and biotechnology in agriculture, health care, environment and general biology. The bill also proposes setting up an inter-ministerial  governing body, to oversee the performance of BRAI, and a National Biotechnology Advisory Council of stakeholders to provide feedback on the use of  [[biotechnology]] products and organisms in the society.&lt;ref name=press_rel/&gt; The regulatory body will be an autonomous and statutory agency to regulate the research, transport, import, and manufacture [[biotechnology]] products and organisms.&lt;ref name=press_rel&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulatory Authority to be Set Up on Bio-Technology|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=84347|publisher=Press Information Bureau, [[Government of India]]|accessdate=24 March 2014|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

[[Suman Sahai]], founder of the [[Gene Campaign]], has called the bill flawed. According to her, the bill is proposing new institutes without clearly defining their powers and responsibilities. She has also stated that the bill was introduced without consulting the people who will be affected by the bill.&lt;ref name=suman_sahai/&gt; 

[[P. M. Bhargava]], founder of the [[Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology]], has also opposed the bill. He has called the bill unconstitutional, as agricultural policy is the domain of state governments. He pointed out that the bill proposes formation of several subdivisions and has argued that they will consist of bureaucrats with no scientific knowledge. He has accused the [[Department of Biotechnology]], which will be involved in selection of members, as a promoter of genetic technology in India. He has pointed out that the broadly defined term "confidential commercial information" has been kept outside the purview of the [[Right to Information Act]]. He had stated that the bill uses vague wordings which would criminalize sequencing or isolation of DNA and PCR techniques, requiring approval for each usage. Thus, hindering research and education. He pointed out the bill has no provision for mandatory labelling of GM foods. He criticized giving the body power to punish parties making false or misleading statements about GM crops, calling it unprecedented.&lt;ref name=bhargava&gt;{{cite news|title=Unconstitutional, unethical, unscientific|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/unconstitutional-unethical-unscientific/article2752711.ece|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=5 January 2012|author=[[Pushpa Mittra Bhargava|Pushpa M. Bhargava]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2010, [[Jairam Ramesh]], then Environment Minister, pointed out that the body is only deals with safety and efficacy of biotechnology products. The issue of commercialization has been left unaddressed. The decisions regarding commercialization can fall under the purview of [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment and Forests]], [[Ministry of Health]], [[Ministry of Agriculture]], or [[Department of Science and Technology (India)|Department of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref name=2010_limbo/&gt;

On the other hand, [[Association of Biotechnology Led Enterprises]] (ABLE) has supported the bill. J.S. Rehman, an entomologist and a former member of the Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation, has stated that most protesters associate genetic engineering with [[Monsanto]], as a result development of Indian biotech is being hindered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Let’s unMonsanto the debate|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/blogs/blogs-the-copernican/article5085741.ece|accessdate=1 April 2014|date=2 September 2013|author=Vasudevan Mukunth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{co2}} cleaning has found application in many industries and technical areas, including aerospace, automotive, electronics, medical, manufacturing, basic and applied research, and [[optics]].&lt;ref name=co2clean-applications/&gt;&lt;ref name=coldjet-industries/&gt; The different carbon dioxide cleaning methods can remove gross contamination, [[paint]], [[overlayer]]s, [[grease (lubricant)|grease]], [[fingerprint]]s, particles down to nanometers in size, [[hydrocarbon]] and [[organic compound|organic]] [[Residue (chemistry)|residue]]s, and [[radioactive]] residues.  Materials cleaned include metals, polymers, ceramics, and glasses.&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|270}} The key limitation is that the contamination must be on the surface, not buried within the material.  Porous materials are not good candidates for pellets or snow, but can be cleaned using liquid or supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Methods==
Carbon dioxide cleaning refers to several different methods for parts cleaning, making use of all phases of {{co2}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.co2clean.com/#!afm/cfrpf|title=co2clean|website=co2clean|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; basic methods include solid [[dry ice]] pellets, liquid {{co2}}, {{co2}} snow (a hybrid method), and [[supercritical fluid|supercritical]] {{co2}}. The different forms of {{co2}} cleaning can clean many types of objects, from large generators to small and delicate parts, including hard drives and optics.&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|270}}

=== Pellets ===
[[Image:Bakerycleaning.jpg|thumb|Dry-ice blasting used to clean bakery equipment]]
In pellet cleaning ("[[dry-ice blasting]]"), relatively large pellets of solid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are fired at the surface to be cleaned. These pellets impinge on the surface, mechanically dislodging contaminant particles. Pellet cleaning is only appropriate for surfaces which can withstand significant impacts.&lt;ref name=co2clean-methods/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|276}}

===Snow cleaning===
In CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; snow cleaning, compressed liquid or gaseous [[carbon dioxide]] is expelled from a nozzle, condensing into a mixture of solid particles and gas, which impact the surface to be cleaned.&lt;ref name=co2clean-methods/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|276}} Jet velocities are frequently supersonic.&lt;ref name=coldjet-how/&gt; Snow cleaning works by a combination of momentum transfer (mechanically dislodging contaminant particles) and [[solvent]] action.&lt;ref name=co2clean-methods/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|273}} The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimates]] on contact, increasing in volume up to 800 times, thereby generating pressure to sweep particles away.&lt;ref name=coldjet-how/&gt; The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also dissolves hydrocarbon contaminants, and its low temperature [[wikt:embrittlement|embrittles]] residues such as fingerprints, making them easier to blow away.&lt;ref name=co2clean-main/&gt;&lt;ref name=fraunhofer-gesellschaft/&gt;

Snow cleaning has found application in the [[aerospace manufacturer|aeronautical]], [[automotive industry|automotive]], [[medical device|medical]], [[optics|optical]], [[semiconductor device fabrication|semiconductor]], and [[space industry|space]] industries. It can provide a gentle cleaning, appropriate for delicate surfaces.&lt;ref name=co2clean-main/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|270}}&lt;ref name=fraunhofer-gesellschaft/&gt; The effectiveness of carbon dioxide snow cleaning has been demonstrated via light [[microscopy]], particle counting, [[scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]], [[microprobe|microprobing]], [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]], [[atomic-force microscopy]],&lt;ref name=co2clean-afm/&gt;&lt;ref name= Chernoff /&gt; and [[mass spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|279}}

Equipment costs for a carbon dioxide snow cleaning system can range from US$1500 for a basic system to $50,000 for a high-end automated unit.&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|292}} Material costs are comparatively low, although ultra-pure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must often be used to avoid the introduction of new contaminants.

===Supercritical fluid===
At temperatures and pressures above its [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]], CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be maintained as a [[supercritical fluid]], exhibiting extremely low [[viscosity]] and high [[solvent|solvency]]. To apply this method, parts to be cleaned are enclosed in a pressure vessel that is then filled with supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This method is appropriate for small and delicate parts such as microelectronics, and is not ideal for particulate removal.&lt;ref name=Ober/&gt;&lt;ref name=co2clean-methods/&gt; Aside from cleaning, applications of [[supercritical carbon dioxide]] include targeted chemical [[extraction (chemistry)|supercritical fluid extraction]] and materials processing.

===Liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; washing===
Liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; washing, like supercritical fluid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; washing, relies on the high solvent power of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|275}} but at lower temperatures and pressures, the latter making it simpler to implement. Because liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; does not have the solvent power of supercritical fluid, agitation and [[surfactant]]s may be added to improve the effectiveness of the method.&lt;ref name=co2clean-methods/&gt;  Liquid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been used in [[dry cleaning]] and machined parts [[solvent degreasing|degreasing]].

==History==
Carbon dioxide cleaning was contemplated in the 1930s, and the "pellet" approach was developed in the 1970s by E.E. Rice, C.H. Franklin, and C.C. Wong.&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|276}}

The introduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; snow cleaning, with its ability to remove sub-micron-scale particles, is credited to Stuart Hoenig of the [[University of Arizona]], who first published on the topic in 1985-1986.&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|277}}&lt;ref name=US5125979/&gt; Hoenig traveled the US to demonstrate the technology, eventually attracting the interest of [[The BOC Group]], which developed [[Venturi tube|Venturi nozzle]]s for the process, and [[Hughes Aircraft Company|Hughes Aircraft]], which developed straight nozzles.&lt;ref name=co2clean-faqs/&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; snow cleaning was further developed by the [[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation IPA]], for the purpose of removing [[paint]] from aircraft [[fuselage]]s.&lt;ref name=fraunhofer-gesellschaft/&gt;

Nozzle design is the most significant factor in carbon dioxide snow cleaning performance, affecting the size and velocity of the dry ice particles.&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|277–278}} Variations in nozzle design have been developed by W.H. Whitlock, L.L. Layden, Applied Surface Technologies, and Sierra Systems Group.&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|277}}

==Issues==

===Safety===
CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cleaning may present certain safety risks. If the process is used to remove hazardous materials, precautions must be taken to avoid exposure to these materials in the vent stream. Because the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; stream is [[cryogenic]], it may cause injury with direct skin contact. In addition, care must be taken to prevent the concentration of carbon dioxide in the work area from [[hypercapnia|exceeding safe levels]].&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|272}}&lt;ref name=co2clean-safety/&gt;

===Contamination===
Some commercial grades of carbon dioxide may contain traces of heavy [[hydrocarbon]]s, which can be left behind on the surface being cleaned. Abrasive particles originating in the cleaning equipment itself may need to be filtered out as well. The low temperature of the carbon dioxide stream can also induce moisture [[condensation]] on the part, which may be mitigated with [[hot plates]], [[heat gun]]s, [[infrared lamp|heat lamp]]s, or [[dry box]]es.&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|292–294}}

===Static charge===
[[Ionization]] caused by the flowing gas can result in potentially damaging [[static charge]] buildup on non-[[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductive]] parts. This can be mitigated by [[Ground (electricity)|grounding]] or positive ionization sources.&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;{{rp|294}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2286">'''Certified MBA''' ('''CMBA''') was a [[professional certification]] designed as an "objective measure of a student's grasp of the [[MBA]] skill set". It was offered by the International Certification Institute.

The CMBA focused on the "10 key subject areas" comprising the MBA "[[MBA#Content|core curriculum]]"  ([[Financial Accounting]], [[Management Accounting]], [[Quantitative analysis (finance)|Quantitative Analysis]], [[Microeconomics]], [[Macroeconomics]], [[Finance]], [[Marketing Management]], [[Operations Management]], [[Organizational Behavior]], and [[Business Strategy]]). The certification was a series of exams taken over several days.  Each four-hour exam focused on several of the subject areas and was composed of [[multiple choice question]]s. The exams were administered by [[Prometric]].

The certification was incorporated into the [[Western Governors University]] MBA program  for several years.&lt;ref name="MBAPDF"&gt;{{cite book |title=MBA BA |publisher=Western Govenors University |url=http://www.wgu.edu/wgu/prog_guide/MBA_BA.pdf |accessdate=3 November 2018 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loberg was born in Sweden on January 1, 1970 and grew up in Woolgoolga, NSW and attended Woolgoolga High School. He was educated in fine arts at [[Lund University]] Sweden, Business &amp; Leadership at [[London Business School]] United Kingdom, and International Business at [[QUT]] Graduate school of business Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=54697511&amp;privcapId=53444512|title=Claes Loberg: Executive Profile &amp; Biography - Bloomberg|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bloomberg.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Loberg founded his first company Hyro.com in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bandt.com.au/news/archive/branded-content-group-comes-to-australia|title=Branded content group comes to Australia|author=James Bainbridge|date=8 July 2004|publisher=bandt.com|accessdate=20 June 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120724074302/http://www.bandt.com.au/news/archive/branded-content-group-comes-to-australia#|archive-date=2012-07-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.adnews.com.au/sitesearch?criteria=claes+loberg# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-05-29 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130422203746/https://www.adnews.com.au/sitesearch?criteria=claes+loberg# |archive-date=2013-04-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was listed on the Australian stock exchange (ASX:HYO) and ranked as one of the biggest IT and web development companies in Australia with offices in China, Thailand and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?symbol=HYO.AX|title=Hyro Ltd (HYO.AX) Company Profile|date=2009-02-09|publisher=Reuters.com|accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loberg founded Guvera in 2008 with Brad Christiansen and Darren Herft. In 2010, Guvera was launched as an MP3 site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7446745/guvera-ceo-darren-herft-is-stepping-down|title=Guvera CEO Darren Herft Is Stepping Down|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loberg and helped raise an initial $20 million investment for Guvera through private equity firm AMMA. &lt;ref&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/18/guvera-funding/&lt;/ref&gt;

Guvera was ranked by [[Billboard Magazine]] as one of the Best Digital Music Startups of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2010/08/billboard-names-10-best-digital-music-startups.html|title=Billboard Names 10 Best Digital Music Startups|last=|first=|date=|website=hypebot|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Loberg was listed in [[Ernst &amp; Young]] 2011 Entrepreneur of the year&lt;ref&gt;http://eoy.ey.com.au/claes-loberg-guvera-limited/w1/i1609675/&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=January 2018}} after winning the Technology category in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoy.ey.com.au/2011-technology-category-national-finalists/w1/i1645290/ |title=2011 Technology category National finalists &amp;#124; Entrepreneur of the Year |publisher=Eoy.ey.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=January 2018}}

==Guvera==
{{Main|Guvera}}

In 2008 Loberg, Brad Christiansen and Darren Herft set up Guvera Limited in Robina, Australia. In January 2010, the company launched its legal music streaming and download service [[Guvera]]. Claes Loberg currently serves as its Director of Innovation and on its board of directors. In July 2016, it was reported that Loberg would become CEO as Darren Herft stepped down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Billboard Staff|title=Guvera CEO Darren Herft Is Stepping Down|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7446745/guvera-ceo-darren-herft-is-stepping-down|website=Billboard.com|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guvera, acquired Blinkbox Music from UK retail chain Tesco in January 2011. Then Blinkbox was closed six months later as reported in BRW Australia.

'''Danish Open Source Society''' (abbreviated '''DOSS''') is working to promote [[open standard]]s and [[open source]]. The purpose of DOSS is to create tangible results through the work of the its members. DOSS has a very pragmatic approach and values tangible results higher than intangible principles. Most of the work of DOSS is done by a small group of very serious members.

As part of the DOSS-approach to promote Open Source, the society is behind a development project in [[Chinandega]] in the Northeastern [[Nicaragua]]. Open Source is here used to enhance the communication and learning in several villages. In that way DOSS is contributing, through the promotion of Open Source, to the improvement of the conditions of life in a specific area of the world.

This pilot project can be viewed as an integrated part of the overall strategy of DOSS on the promotion of Open Source and Open Standards.

'''Debt restructuring''' is a process that allows a private or public company, or a sovereign entity facing cash flow problems and [[financial distress]] to reduce and renegotiate its delinquent [[debt]]s to improve or restore [[liquidity]] so that it can continue its operations.

Replacement of old debt by new debt when not under financial distress is called "[[refinancing]]". Out-of-court [[restructuring]]s, also known as '''{{visible anchor|workout}}s''', are increasingly becoming a global reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTLAWJUSTICE/Resources/OutOfCourtDebtRestructuringBeforeTypesetting.pdf|title=Out-of-Court Debt Restructuring|last=|first=|date=|website=|page=54|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivation ==
A debt restructuring, which involves a reduction of debt and an extension of payment terms, is usually a less expensive alternative to [[bankruptcy]]. The main costs associated with debt restructuring are the time and effort negotiating with bankers, creditors, vendors, and tax authorities.

In the United States, small business [[bankruptcy]] filings cost at least $50,000 in legal and court fees, and filing costs in excess of $100,000 are common. By some measures, only 20% of firms survive [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy filings.&lt;ref&gt;Buljevich, Esteban C.,''Cross Border Debt Restructuring: Innovative Approaches for Creditors, Corporate and Sovereigns'' {{ISBN|1-84374-194-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, debt restructuring has been the province of large corporations with financial wherewithal. In the  [[Great Recession]] that began with the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], a component of debt restructuring called debt mediation emerged for small businesses (with revenues under $5 million). Like debt restructuring, debt mediation is a business-to-business activity and should not be considered the same as individual debt reduction involving [[credit card]]s, unpaid taxes, and defaulted mortgages.

In 2010 debt mediation has become a primary way for small businesses to refinance in light of reduced lines of credit and direct borrowing. Debt mediation can be cost-effective for small businesses, help end or avoid litigation, and is preferable to filing for bankruptcy. While there are numerous companies providing restructuring for large corporations, there are few legitimate firms working for small businesses. Legitimate debt restructuring firms only work for the debtor client (not as a debt [[collection agency]]) and should charge fees based on success.

Among the debt situations that can be worked out in business-to-business debt mediation are: lawsuits and judgments, delinquent property, machinery, equipment rentals/leases, business loans or mortgage on business property, capital payments due for improvements/construction, invoices and statements, disputed bills and problem debts.

== Methods ==
=== Debt-for-equity swap ===
In a debt-for-equity swap, a company's [[creditor]]s generally agree to cancel some or all of the [[debt]] in exchange for [[shareholder's equity|equity]] in the company.

Debt for equity deals often occur when large companies run into serious financial trouble, and often result in these companies being taken over by their principal creditors. This is because both the debt and the remaining assets in these companies are so large that there is no advantage for the creditors to drive the company into bankruptcy. Instead the creditors prefer to take control of the business as a [[going concern]]. As a consequence, the original shareholders' stake in the company is generally significantly diluted in these deals and may be entirely eliminated, as is typical in a [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]].

Debt-for-equity swaps are one way of dealing with [[Subprime lending|sub-prime]] mortgages. A householder unable to service his debt on a $180,000 mortgage for example, may by agreement with his bank have the value of the mortgage reduced (say to $135,000 or 75% of the house's current value), in return for which the bank will receive 50% of the amount by which any resale value, when the house is resold, exceeds $135,000.

=== Bondholder haircuts ===
A debt-for-equity swap may also be called a "bondholder [[Haircut (finance)|haircut]]". Bondholder haircuts at large banks were advocated as a potential solution for the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] by prominent economists: 

Economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] testified that bank [[bailout]]s "are really bailouts not of the enterprises but of the [[shareholder]]s and especially bondholders. There is no reason that American taxpayers should be doing this". He wrote that reducing bank debt levels by converting debt into equity will increase confidence in the financial system. He believes that addressing bank solvency in this way would help address credit market liquidity issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/opinion/01stiglitz.html|title=Obama’s Ersatz Capitalism|date=1 April 2009|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]] has also argued in favor of such haircuts: "The cheaper and more equitable way would be to make shareholders and bank bondholders take the hit rather than the taxpayer. The Fed and other bank regulators would insist that bad loans be written down on the books. Bondholders would take haircuts, but these losses are already priced into deeply discounted bond prices."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/03/making_rich_guys_richer.html "Jeffrey Sachs: Our Wall Street Besotted Public Policy"], Real Clear Politics, March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

If the key issue is bank solvency, converting debt to equity via bondholder [[Haircut (finance)|haircuts]] presents an elegant solution to the problem. Not only is debt reduced along with interest payments, but equity is simultaneously increased. Investors can then have more confidence that the bank (and financial system more broadly) is solvent, helping unfreeze credit markets. Taxpayers do not have to contribute dollars and the government may be able to just provide guarantees in the short term to buttress confidence in the recapitalized institution. For example, [[Wells Fargo]] owed its bondholders $267 billion, according to its 2008 annual report.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wellsfargo.com/downloads/pdf/invest_relations/wf2008annualreport.pdf Wells Fargo-2008 Annual Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518085043/https://www.wellsfargo.com/downloads/pdf/invest_relations/wf2008annualreport.pdf |date=2012-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 20% haircut would reduce this debt by about $54 billion, creating an equal amount of equity in the process, thereby recapitalizing the bank significantly.

=== Informal debt repayment agreements ===
Most [[defendant]]s who cannot pay the enforcement officer in full at once enter into negotiations with the officer to pay by installments. This process is informal but cheaper and quicker than an application to the court. 
 
Payment by this method relies on the cooperation of the creditor and the enforcement officer. It is therefore important not to offer more than you can afford or to fall behind with the payments you agree. If you do fall behind with the payments and the enforcement officer has seized goods, they may remove them to the sale room for auction.

== In various jurisdictions ==
=== Switzerland ===
{{Main|Insolvency law of Switzerland}}
Under [[Switzerland|Swiss]] law, debt restructuring may occur out of court, or through a court-mediated debt restructuring agreement that may provide for a partial waiver of debts, or for a liquidation of the debtor's assets by the creditors.

=== United Kingdom ===
The majority of debt restructuring within the [[United Kingdom]] is undertaken on a collaborative basis between the borrower and the creditors. Should this be unsatisfactory in the first instance, the court may be asked to mediate and appoint administrators.

=== Italy ===
Debt restructuring within [[Italy]] may occur either out of court (ex article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law) when a waiver or simple debt rescheduling is required, or through a court-mediated debt restructuring agreement (ex article 182/bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law) and may provide for a partial waiver of debts, mandatory recapitalization of the debtor, or for a liquidation of certain debtor's assets to repay privileged creditors. 

=== Germany ===
While being famous for its efficiency in other matter, this is not true for debt restructuring. Many German companies prefer to restructure their debts using the English scheme of arrangement proceedings because they believe that the German restructuring law is not very helpful. The main reason for this is that binding a dissenting minority is only possible under formal insolvency proceedings in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/oxlaw/bork_debt_restructuring_in_germany.pdf|title=Debt Restructuring in Germany|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corporate restructuring ==
As the incidence of corporate failures has increased in part due to current economic climate, so a more "standard" approach to restructuring has developed. Although every case has unique characteristics, the process of restructuring follows a number of important phases. Initially, a downturn in trading performance is identified typically through management accounts or as a result of revised management projections. This triggers a gathering of lenders and other stakeholders, in anticipation of a breach of [[financial covenants]] or a crisis of [[liquidity]].

The lending group (typically comprising corporate finance divisions of banks) will normally commission a corporate advisory group to review the business and its financial position. This will form the basis of any restructuring of facilities. The lending group will typically appoint a [[Corporate Restructuring Officer]] (CRO) to assist management in the turnaround of the business, and embracing the recommendations presented by the banking group and the corporate advisory report.

'''Downtown Detroit''' is the [[central business district]] and a [[Neighborhoods in Detroit|residential]] area of the city of [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], United States. Detroit is the major city in the larger [[Metro Detroit]] region. Downtown Detroit is bordered by [[M-10 (Michigan highway)|M-10]] (Lodge Freeway) to the west, [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|Interstate 75]] (I-75, Fisher Freeway) to the north, [[Interstate 375 (Michigan)|I-375]] (Chrysler Freeway) to the east, and the [[Detroit River]] to the south. The city's main thoroughfare [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|M-1]] (Woodward Avenue) links Downtown to [[Midtown Detroit|Midtown]], [[New Center, Detroit|New Center]], and the [[North End, Detroit|North End]].

Downtown contains much [[Architecture of metropolitan Detroit|historic architecture]] and many of the prominent skyscrapers in Detroit, including the [[Renaissance Center]], the [[Penobscot Building]], [[One Detroit Center]], and the [[Guardian Building]]. Historic churches, [[Theatre in Detroit|theatres]], and commercial buildings anchor the various downtown districts. Downtown has a number of parks including those linked by a promenade along the [[Detroit International Riverfront|International Riverfront]]. Its central square is [[Campus Martius Park]].

==Overview==
[[File:RenCen.JPG|thumb|150px|left|The [[Renaissance Center]] along the [[Detroit International Riverfront|International Riverfront]]]]
In recent years the downtown area has seen tremendous growth and redevelopment. Since 2000 a number of major construction projects have been completed including the new [[Compuware World Headquarters|Compuware Headquarters]] at [[Campus Martius Park]] and two new stadiums: [[Comerica Park]] and [[Ford Field]]. [[General Motors]] moved their headquarters into the [[Renaissance Center]], and the [[Detroit Lions]] have relocated from [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] to Downtown Detroit. High-profile events like the 2005 [[MLB All-Star Game]], [[Super Bowl XL]], and the [[2006 World Series|2006]] and [[2012 World Series]] have taken place in downtown, generating income for local businesses and spurring more growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061106/NEWS05/611060337/-1/BUSINESS07 Detroit Free Press (2006-11-06)]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, new residents are moving into Detroit in the assortment of new lofts that are opening. An example of these trends is the [[Westin Book-Cadillac Hotel]]. In 2006, the Cleveland-based Ferchill Group began the $180 million redevelopment of the historic Book Cadlliac Hotel at the corner of Washington Blvd. and Michigan Avenue. The project, which has been hailed by preservationists houses a 455-room Westin Hotel, 67 high-end condominiums, and two to three restaurants, and some miscellaneous retail serving hotel and conference center guests. [[DTE Energy Headquarters]] features an urban oasis of parks, walkways, and a reflecting pool.&lt;ref name=DTE&gt;[http://www.downtowndetroit.org/ddp/newsroom/detroit_news_july_4_2007.htm July 4, 2007 Detroit News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928034741/http://www.downtowndetroit.org/ddp/newsroom/detroit_news_july_4_2007.htm |date=September 28, 2007 }} ''Downtown Detroit Partnership''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elisabeth "Sissy" Waldheim''' (née '''Ritschel'''; 13 April 1922 – 28 February 2017) was an Austrian political figure and the wife of [[Kurt Waldheim]], the [[UN Secretary-General]] and [[President of Austria]]. She was the [[First Lady of Austria]] from 1986 to 1992.

She was born in [[Vienna]] as the eldest of three sisters to Wilhelm Ritschel and his wife Hildegard. Her paternal grandfather was a military official in the imperial army. After the fall of the Habsburg empire, he became an entrepreneur. Elisabeth was named after the former Austrian empress [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|of the same name]] and nicknamed "Sissy".

Waldheim decided to study law at [[University of Vienna]], where she first met Kurt Waldheim. On 19 August 1944, in the middle of the Second World War, the couple married in Vienna. Their first daughter, Lieselotte, was born in 1945. According to her husband's ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' obituary, "[s]he was an ardent Nazi who before the war had renounced her Roman Catholic faith and joined the [[League of German Maidens]], the young women’s equivalent of the [[Hitler Youth]]. She applied for [[Nazi Party]] membership as soon as she was old enough, and was accepted in 1941".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kandell|first=Jonathan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/15/world/europe/15waldheim.html?pagewanted=all|title=Kurt Waldheim, Former U.N. Chief, Is Dead at 88|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=15 June 2007|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She gave up her own job in order to support her husband's diplomatic and political career. He became the [[Foreign Minister of Austria]] and UN Secretary General. In 1986, he was elected President of Austria and she became Austria's [[First Lady]]. The couple had three children: daughter Lieselotte Waldheim-Natural works for the United Nations, daughter Christa Waldheim-Karas became an artist (she is married to [[Othmar Karas]], Austrian [[Member of the European Parliament]]), and son Gerhard Waldheim is an investment banker. She spoke German, English and French.&lt;ref&gt;Senta Ziegler: "Österreichs First Ladies". Wien. Ueberreuter 1999&lt;/ref&gt; She died on 28 February 2017 at the age of 94.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wien.orf.at/news/stories/2828200/ Meldung auf der Website des ORF vom], orf.at, 28 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5832">'''Enterprise software''', also known as '''enterprise application software''' ('''EAS'''), is [[computer software]] used to satisfy the needs of an [[organization]] rather than individual users. Such organizations include businesses, schools, interest-based user groups, clubs, charities, and governments. Enterprise software is an integral part of a (computer-based) [[information system]].

Services provided by enterprise software are typically business-oriented tools, such as online shopping, and [[online payment]] processing, interactive product catalogue, automated billing systems, security, [[Business process management|Business Process Management]],  [[enterprise content management]], [[IT Service Management]], [[customer relationship management]], [[enterprise resource planning]], [[business intelligence]], [[project management]], [[collaboration]], [[human resource management]], manufacturing, [[Occupational safety and health|occupational health and safety]], [[enterprise application integration]], and [[enterprise forms automation]].

As enterprises have similar departments and systems in common, enterprise software is often available as a suite of customizable programs. Generally, the complexity of these tools requires specialist capabilities and specific knowledge.

==Definitions==
Enterprise Software describes a collection of computer programs with common business applications, tools for modeling how the entire organization works, and development tools for building applications unique to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gregvogl.net/courses/mis1/glossary.htm Management Information Systems Glossary of Terms]&lt;/ref&gt; The software is intended to solve an enterprise-wide problem, rather than a departmental problem. Enterprise level software aims to improve the enterprise's productivity and efficiency by providing [[business logic]] support functionality.

According to [[Martin Fowler]], "Enterprise applications are about the display, manipulation, and storage of large amounts of often complex data and the support or automation of [[business processes]] with that data."&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Fowler]], "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture" (2002). Addison Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is no single, widely accepted list of enterprise software characteristics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=504043 What is Enterprise Software?]&lt;/ref&gt; they generally include [[Software performance testing|performance]], [[scalability]], and [[Robustness (computer science)|robustness]]. Furthermore, enterprise software typically has interfaces to other enterprise software (for example [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] to [[directory service]]s) and is centrally managed (a single admin page, for example).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/enterprise-application-software/ Gartner Group: IT Glossary - enterprise application software]&lt;/ref&gt;

Enterprise [[application software]] performs business functions such as order processing, procurement, production scheduling, customer information management, energy management, and accounting. It is typically hosted on servers and provides simultaneous services to a large number of users, typically over a computer network. This is in contrast to a single-user application that is executed on a user's personal computer and serves only one user at a time.

== Types ==
Enterprise software can be categorized by business function. Each type of enterprise application can be considered a "system" due to the integration with a firm's business processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/enterprise_application.html |title=What is enterprise application? - A Word Definition From the Webopedia Computer Dictionary |publisher=Webopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Categories of enterprise software may overlap due to this systemic interpretation. For example, IBM's Business Intelligence platform (Cognos), integrates with a predictive analytics platform (SPSS) and can obtain records from its database packages (Infosphere, DB2). Blurred lines between package functions make delimitation difficult, and in many ways larger software companies define these somewhat arbitrary categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/data/library/techarticle/dm-0810wurst/index.html |title=Integrate InfoSphere Warehouse data mining with IBM Cognos reporting, Part 1: Overview of InfoSphere Warehouse and Cognos integration architecture |publisher=Ibm.com |date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, certain industry standard product categories have emerged, and these are shown below :
* [[Accounting software]]
* [[Electronic billing|Billing]] Management
* [[Business intelligence]]
* [[Business process management]]
* [[Content management system]] (CMS)
* [[Knowledge Management]] (KM)
* [[Customer relationship management]] (CRM)
* [[Database]]
** [[Master data management]] (MDM)
* [[Enterprise resource planning]] (ERP)
* [[Enterprise asset management]] (EAM)
* [[Low-code development platforms]] (LCDP)
* [[Supply chain management]] (SCM)
* [[Backup software]]
* [[Product data management]] (PDM)
* [[Product lifecycle|Product lifecycle management]] (PLM)

==Business==
Foo spends most of his time in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Singapore]], and [[Hong Kong]] instead of his head office in the Foo Yet Kai Building at Jalan Sultan Iskandar. Most of his [[plantation]] and [[aquaculture]] businesses are in Perak.&lt;ref name="r"/&gt; His other business interests includes [[construction]], [[property development]] and [[investment]], [[plywood]] and [[wood]] products and [[Trade|trading]].&lt;ref name="fkw"/&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Foo is well known in donating money to help the poor. Recently, at his daughter's wedding, he announced an RM100 million trust fund for the future generations to assist the needy and the poor. He also said the money from the fund would come from the earnings of his proposed {{convert|20000|acre|km2|sing=on}} [[oil palm]] plantation in the country and from rentals of a proposed 50-unit [[apartment building]] in [[Ampang Jaya|Ampang]], Kuala Lumpur.

==Personal==
His father Foo Yet Kai was also a well known [[philanthropist]] and businessman. He tries to emulate the values his father passed down to him, such as helping his 100 odd member family. Foo comes from a [[family]] of 19 siblings.

The '''Forced Labour Convention''', the full title of which is the '''Convention Concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour, 1930 (No.29)''', is one of eight [[ILO fundamental conventions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/introduction-to-international-labour-standards/conventions-and-recommendations/lang--en/index.htm|title=Conventions and recommendations|work=[[International Labour Organization]]|date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[International Labour Organization]]. Its object and purpose is to suppress the use of forced labour in all its forms irrespective of the nature of the work or the sector of activity in which it may be performed. The Convention defines forced labour as "all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily", with few exceptions like compulsorly military service.&lt;ref&gt;Article 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The convention excludes "adult able-bodied males", to whom legal imposition of forced labour is allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Article 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention was adopted in Geneva 28 June 1930 and came into force on 1 May 1932. By the end of 1932 ten countries had ratified the convention (Japan, Bulgaria, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Australia, Sweden, United Kingdom, Liberia, and Ireland). Austria in 1960, Luxembourg in 1964 and Malta in 1965 were the last Western European countries to ratify the convention. Canada ratified it in 2011 and as of 2015 the United States has not ratified it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:11300:1596796144127291::::P11300_INSTRUMENT_SORT:3|title= Ratifications of C029 - Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29)|author=International Labour Organization |date=2015 |website= |publisher= International Labour Organization |access-date= 4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Convention was supplemented by the [[Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957]] which canceled a number of exceptions to abolishment in the 1930 Convention, such as punishment for strikes and as a punishment for holding certain political views.

==Exceptions to Convention==
Article 2 of the Convention excepts from the term ''forced or compulsory labour'' the following: 
:(a) any work or service exacted in virtue of [[conscription|compulsory military service]] laws for work of a purely [[military character]];
:(b) any work or service which forms part of the normal [[civic obligations]] of the citizens of a fully [[self-governing]] country;
:(c) any work or service exacted from any person as a consequence of a conviction in a [[court of law]], provided that the said work or service is carried out under the supervision and control of a [[public authority]] and that the said person is not hired to or [[private prison|placed at the disposal of private individuals, companies or associations]];
:(d) any work or service exacted in cases of emergency, that is to say, in the event of [[war]], of a [[Disaster|calamity]] or [[threatened calamity]], such as [[fire]], [[flood]], [[famine]], [[earthquake]], [[violent epidemic]] or [[epizootic diseases]], invasion by: [[animal]], [[insect]] or [[vegetable pests]], and in general any circumstance that would endanger the existence or the well-being of the whole or part of the population;
:(e) minor communal services of a kind which, being performed by the members of the community in the direct interest of the said community, can therefore be considered as normal civic obligations incumbent upon the members of the community, provided that the members of the community or their direct representatives shall have the right to be consulted in regard to the need for such services.

Article 11 of the Convention states that ''forced or compulsory labour'' may be imposed only upon "adult able-bodied males who are of an apparent age of not less than 18 and not more than 45 years".

== Ratifications==
As of 2016, the Convention has been ratified 178 of the 187 [[International Labour Organization#Membership|ILO member]]s.&lt;ref name=ratifications/&gt; The ILO members that have not ratified the convention are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:11310:0::NO:11310:P11310_INSTRUMENT_ID:312174:NO|title=Members who have not ratified |date=26 May 2011|accessdate=30 May 2011|work=International Labour Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protocol ==
In 2014, a protocol was adopted by the International Labour Conference: P29, Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930. The Protocol was adopted with 437 votes in favour, 8 against and 27 abstentions (there are 3 votes per member state: one for the government, one for employees, and one for employers). The Government of [[Thailand]] was the only state to vote against adoption,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nebehay|first=Stephanie |title=Pact to halt forced labour snubbed by Thailand, Gulf - ILO |date=11 June 2014 |work=[[Reuters]] |place=Geneva |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-labour-ilo-idUKKBN0EM1XY20140611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://thinkprogress.org/world/2014/06/12/3447958/thailand-military-regime-slavery/&lt;/ref&gt; though it reversed its position a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ganjanakhundee|first=Supalak |title=Thailand reverses earlier decision, backs ILO protocol on forced labour |date=15 June 2014 |work=The Sunday Nation |place=Thailand |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Thailand-reverses-earlier-decision-backs-ILO-proto-30236260.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol obligates states parties to provide protection and appropriate [[legal remedy|remedies]], including [[damages|compensation]], to victims of forced labour and to sanction the perpetrators of forced labour. It also obligates states parties to develop "a national policy and plan of action for the effective and sustained suppression of forced or compulsory labour".

On 14 May 2015, [[Niger]] became the first state to ratify the 2014 Protocol. As of November 2016, it has been ratified by nine states: [[Argentina]], [[Czech Republic]], [[France]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], Niger, [[Norway]], [[Panama]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. The Protocol entered into force on 9 November 2016.

Since the late-2000s, the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) has sought to [[internationalization|internationalize]] its official currency, the [[Renminbi]] (RMB). RMB Internationalization accelerated in 2009 when China established [[dim sum bond]] market and expanded [[Cross-Border Inter-Bank Payments System|Cross-Border Trade]] RMB Settlement Pilot Project, which helps establish pools of offshore RMB liquidity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 2013, the RMB was the 8th most traded currency in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RMB now 8th most widely traded currency in the world|url=http://www.swift.com/about_swift/shownews?param_dcr=news.data/en/swift_com/2013/PR_RMB_september.xml|publisher=[[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication]]|accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 7th most traded in early 2014. By the end of 2014, RMB has ranked 5th as the most traded currency, according to SWIFT's report, at 2.2% of [[SWIFT]] payment behind [[JPY]] (2.7%), GBP (7.9%), EUR (28.3%) and USD (44.6%). In February 2015 RMB became the second most used currency for trade and services, and reach the ninth position in forex trading. The [[RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor]] (RQFII) quotas were also extended  to other five countries - the UK (extended 15 October 2013), Singapore (22 October 2013), France (20 June 2014), Korea (18 July 2014), Germany (18 July 2014), and Canada (8 November 2014), each with the quotas of ¥80bn except Canada and Singapore (¥50bn). Previously, only Hong Kong was allowed, with a ¥270bn quota. 

The launch of Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect (SSE and HKEx) in November 2014 embarked China upon the next stage of internationalization. In January 2015 Chinese Premier, [[Li Keqiang]], announced a planned second Stock Connect linking [[Shenzhen]] and [[Hong Kong stock exchange|Hong Kong exchange]]s. The China's RMB internationalization and foreign exchange (FX) reforms are evolving rapidly and full convertibility is expected over the next couple of years.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.research.hsbc.com/midas/Res/RDV?p=pdf&amp;key=qaq8Q1dIrV&amp;n=424259.PDF|title = Asian FX Focus, RMB Q&amp;A: The top 10 questions|date = 29 July 2014|journal = HSBC Global Research|accessdate = 8 August 2014|doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, Hong Kong removed the conversion limit of 20,000 RMB per day for its residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/key-information/speech-speakers/ntlchan/20141112-1.shtml|title=Removal of RMB conversion limit for Hong Kong residents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Until the early years of the 21st century, the Renminbi was not fully convertible and its flow in and out of China faced heavy restrictions. Under instructions from the Chinese government, the [[People's Bank of China]] (PBoC), began the move to full convertibility beginning around 2008. This has taken the form of permitting the use of RMB outside China for all current account transactions such as commercial trade, payment of services, interest payment, dividend payment, etc. and the use of RMB for certain approved capital account transactions such as foreign direct investment (FDI), outward direct investment (ODI), Central banks and offshore Participating banks can invest excess RMB in mainland interbank bond market through [[China Interbank Bond Market]] (CIBM quota), investment into mainland China (through [[RQFII]] quota), offshore investment from mainland (through [[Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor|QDII]] quota), including the onshore individual investment to offshore through Qualified Domestic Individual Investors program (so-called QDII2).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to the [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication]] (SWIFT), the path of RMB internationalisation can be divided into three phases—first as usage for [[trade finance]], then for investment, and in the longer term, as [[reserve currency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RMB internationalisation: Perspectives on the future of RMB clearing|url=http://www.swift.com/assets/swift_com/documents/products_services/SWIFT_White_paper_RMB_internationalisation_EN.pdf|publisher=[[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication]]|accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2004, yuan was not allowed outside of China. In 2004, China started to allow border trading in yuan especially in the Southern and Western border.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;"RMB Settlement", Kasikorn Research Center, Bangkok, 8 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; HKMA first raised with the PBoC the idea of introducing personal renminbi business in Hong Kong as early as November 2001, to facilitate economic and social exchanges between Hong Kong and the Mainland and to channel renminbi cashnotes in Hong Kong back to the Mainland orderly through the banking system. In November 2003, the State Council approved the introduction of personal renminbi business in Hong Kong, which followed by the appointment of the Clearing Bank, establishment of payment system linkages and arrangements for cross-border renminbi cashnote delivery. Banks in Hong Kong started to offer renminbi deposit-taking, currency exchange, remittance and debit and credit card services to personal accounts on 25 February 2004.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/key-information/insight/20140218.shtml|title = Hong Kong as Offshore Renminbi Centre – Past and Prospects|date = 18 February 2014|accessdate = 24 July 2014|website = |publisher = HKMA|last = Chan|first = Norman T.L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|May 2014}}, 1.47% of world payments was settled in RMB, which ranked RMB as the 7th most traded currency in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.swift.com/assets/swift_com/documents/products_services/RMB_tracker_June2014_SDC_final.pdf|title = The Renminbi is the second most used currency for cross border payments with China and Hong Kong|date = 26 June 2014|accessdate = 23 July 2013|website = SWIFT RMB Monthly Tracker 2014|publisher = SWIFT}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average monthly RMB trade settlement rose from CN¥320 billion in 2013 to ¥480bn in 2014.

===2007: Creation of ''Dim Sum'' bonds and offshore RMB bond market  ===

The dim sum bond market generally refers to RMB-denominated bonds issued in Hong Kong. The majority of dim sum bond are denominated in CNH, but some are linked to CNY (but paid in USD). In July 2007, [[Dim sum bond|''dim sum'' bond]]s worth a total of US$657 million were issued for the first time by [[China Development Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CDB to issue 5 bln yuan RMB bond in HK |url=http://english.gov.cn/2007-06/26/content_662569.htm |publisher=gov.cn |accessdate=10 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705012749/http://english.gov.cn/2007-06/26/content_662569.htm |archivedate=5 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These financial assets were issued to foreign investors in [[renminbi]], rather than the local currency.&lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/dim-sum-bonds-are-fueling-chinas-currency-rise/2011/11/15/gIQAML23cN_story.html ‘Dim sum bonds’ are fueling China’s currency rise]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, China allowed Financial Institutions in Hong Kong to issue dim sum bonds. HSBC was the first FI that issued RMB Bond (dim sum bond). In August 2010, [[McDonald's advertising|McDonald]] was the first corporatation that issued dim sum bonds. In October, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) raised a ¥1.2bn 10-year bond, and became the first [[Supranational union|supranational agency]] who issued dim sum bond and also the first dim sum bond listed in [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange|HKSE]]. The dim sum bonds market grew 2.3 times from 2010 (¥35.8bn) to 2013 (¥116.6bn), with outstanding amount at the end of 2013 of RMF 310bn.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In August 2012, China and Taiwan signed an memorandum of understanding on new cross-straits currency settlement and in March 2013, China Trust Commercial Bank became the first to issue RMB bonds in Taiwan market (Formosa bond). In November, [[China Construction Bank|CCB]] (Hong Kong) issued a Formosa bond after mainland banks became eligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://research.standardchartered.com/researchdocuments/Pages/ResearchArticle.aspx?&amp;R=118579|title = Offshore RMB – A guide to Formosa investments|date = 24 June 2014|accessdate = 24 July 2014|website = |publisher = Standard Chartered Global Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2008: Cross-Border Trade RMB Settlement Pilot Project&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ===
Phase I: on 24 December 2008, China allowed import and export in RMB between (i) Yunnan province and countries in GMS including [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] countries (ii) Guangdong province and Hong Kong and Macau.

Phase II: on 1 July 2009, China officially announced regulation on RMB Settlement Pilot Project and opened up Shanghai and 4 cities in Guangdong (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Dongguan) with Hong Kong, Macau and ASEAN countries.

On 1 July 2010 expanded to Mainland Designated Enterprises (MDE) in 20 pilot areas (4 municipalities [Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, Shanghai], 12 provinces [Liaoning, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Hubei, Guangdong, Hainan, Sichuan, Yunnan, Jilin, Heilongjiang] and 4 autonomous regions [Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Xinjing Uygur, Tibet]), which allow to the cross border payment of current account items with any country in the world.

By 2014, RMB cross-border trade settlement reached RMB 5.9 trn making a 42.6% (YoY) increase, which represent 22% of China's trading volume.

===2009: Offshore Renminbi (CNH) ===

Since 2009, China has signed [[currency swap]] agreements with numerous countries and regions such as [[Argentina]], [[Belarus]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[European Central Bank|ECB]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Iceland]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Thailand]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Tajikistan]].&lt;ref name="China Daily"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2015-09/05/content_21791172.htm |title=Tajikistan, China sign currency swap deal |date=5 September 2015 |website=[[China Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reutersuzbekistan"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/19/china-uzbekistan-swap-idUSB9E7EN02P20110419 | work=Reuters | title=China signs 700 mln yuan currency swap deal with Uzbekistan | date=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftbrazil"&gt;{{cite web|last=Joe Leahy|title=Brazil and China agree currency swap|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/015f526a-bc07-11e1-9aff-00144feabdc0.html|publisher=''[[Financial Times]]''|quote=China has launched an aggressive campaign of “currency swap diplomacy”, signing about 20 such agreements over the past four years with countries ranging from Argentina to Australia and the United Arab Emirates.|accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.kasikornbank.com/chinatrade/pdfdocumentdownload/importantdocuments/file2%20next%20decade%20asia%20booklet%20world%20economic%20summary.pdf|title = Next Decade: ASIA|date = 2013|accessdate = 23 July 2014|website = Kasikornbank: China Economic Issues|publisher = Kasikorn Research Center (KResearch)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renminbi deposits in HK gradually grew from ¥12 billion in 2004 to ¥59 billion in 2009.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

On 17 August 2010, PBoC issued policy to allow Central Bank, RMB offshore Clearing Banks and offshore Participating Bank to invest the excess RMB in debt securities, in onshore Inter-bank Bond Market. In October, China further open up both FDI and ODI in RMB (Pilot RMB Settlement of Outward Direct Investment) and nominated Xinjiang as the first pilot province (which in early 2011 expanded to 20 pilot areas).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In November 2010, China and Russia began trading in their own currencies, abandoning the [[United States dollar]] as the medium of exchange in bilateral trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sidestepping the U.S. Dollar, a Russian Exchange Will Swap Rubles and Renminbi|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/15/business/global/15iht-ruble15.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=10 October 2013|first=Andrew E.|last=Kramer|date=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was soon followed by Japan in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China, Japan to Back Direct Trade of Currencies|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-25/china-japan-to-promote-direct-trading-of-currencies-to-cut-company-costs.html|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]]|accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 December, the direct trading of yuan against [[Thai baht]] was launched in CFETS (Interbank FX trading system) in [[Yunnan]] and on 31 December, PBC released the ''Announcement of the People’s Bank of China Concerning the Implementation of Measures for the Pilot Program of Allowing Fund Management Companies and Securities Companies Approved as [[Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors]] (RQFII) to Invest in Domestic Securities Market.

As of July 2014, 25 countries have signed the RMB Bilteral Swap Ageement with [[People's Bank of China|PBoC]] with total facilities of over ¥2.7 trillion.

The scale of the offshore renminbi (CNH) market is still limited at the moment, with offshore renminbi deposits (around ¥1.5 trillion, of which 70% are in Hong Kong) only about 1% of that onshore (around ¥100 trillion), which is much lower than the ratio of 30% of offshore versus onshore US dollar deposits. The average daily turnover of offshore renminbi foreign exchange market (CNH) is about US$20 billion by the end of 2013.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; On November 17, synchronised with the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect debut, the HKMA has lifted the daily yuan conversion cap (¥20,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.scmp.com/business/economy/article/1638077/hkma-says-yuan-exchange-cap-lifted-november-17-when-stock-connect|title = HKMA scraps 20,000 yuan daily conversion cap in landmark reform|last = Yiu|first = Enoch|date = 13 November 2014|work = South China Morning Post|access-date = 20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2013: Shanghai Free Trade Zone (SFTZ) ===

The [[Shanghai Free-Trade Zone]] (SFTZ) was launched on 29 September 2013 with key implementation details announcing in May 2014. The SFTZ is being used as a test ground for trade,  investment and financial reforms, before the roll out to nationwide. The RMB can flow freely between Free Trade Account (FTA), non-resident onshore account and offshore account. Transactions between resident onshore account outside SFTZ and FTA with the same entity are also allowed provided they do not involve capital account transactions that are not yet approved by [[People's Bank of China|PBoC]] and [[State Administration of Foreign Exchange|SAFE]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== 2016: Cross Border Financing ===

Effective from May 3, 2016; PBoC expanded its pilot program for macro prudential management of cross border financing from FTZ to nationwide.

=== RMB as a reserve currency&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ===

The road to the RMB Internationalization is far from complete.  
* First, the size of the home economy must be large relative to others. In this, China is clearly justified.
* Second, economic stability in the form of low inflation, small budget deficits and stable growth is also important. China’s record of supportive government policies and macro-economic stability has undoubtedly contributed to the RMB’s appeal in recent years. The bursting of Japan’s bubble in the early 1990s was arguably one of the main reasons why yen internationalization stalled. 
* Third, strong official and institutional support. This was an important reason for the dollar’s adoption as a global currency after the [[Second World War]], formalised through the [[Bretton Woods system]]. China has been doing that in the last few years, promoting the use of RMB and its infrastructure with [[ASEAN]], Russia, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Australia, etc. At the [[China Development Forum]] in March 2014, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) stressed the importance of strengthening financial regulations, establishing a deposit insurance scheme and improving market-driven exit mechanisms for financial institutions, while pushing forward reforms.
* Fourth, deep, open and well-regulated capital markets are necessary so the currency can be used to finance trade as well as provide a large enough market in securities for investors. The opening up of China’s onshore capital market will be an important step in the RMB becoming a major investment currency. This is one area where progress has been deliberately slow. For the RMB to be a truly global and become a more widely held reserve currency there needs to be greater access for foreign investors to local capital markets, even deeper global RMB liquidity and wider cross-border flow channels.

==Major milestones==

* 2002, Domestic Securities Investment by [[Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor]] (QFII regulation) was announced in November&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2006-08/26/content_5008366.htm|title = 合格境外机构投资者境内证券投资管理办法|date = 26 August 2006|work = Xinhua Newspaper|accessdate = 13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed foreign investors to access mainland stock markets (A-shares)

* In December 2013, the RMB overtook the euro to become the second most-used currency in global trade finance after the US dollar, according to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.ibtimes.com/yuan-overtakes-euro-second-most-used-currency-international-trade-settlement-swift-1492476|title = Yuan Overtakes Euro As Second-Most Used Currency In International Trade Settlement: SWIFT|last = Sreeja|first = VN|date = 3 December 2013|work = International Business Times|accessdate = 13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Implications for the financial industry ==

* '''Trade settlement'''  - The internationalization of the RMB allows foreign companies trading with mainland Chinese companies to settle the trade in RMB, thus, reducing FX cost, open up the opportunity to the larger markets and often secure better trade terms. 
* '''Financing and borrowing'''  - creation of dim sum and offshore RMB bond markets offer RMB borrows the chance to access a competitive and diversify funding sources. It is also opened up opportunities for international and retail investors.  
* '''Capital management'''  - free trade zone companies may borrow and lend funds directly with overseas (RMB cash pooling). This allows multinational companies to centrally manage their funds and make payments directly in RMB globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=cc9cd91e-93d5-4cd5-b295-c85614f538c0|title = RMB internationalisation and its implication for Europe|last = Wang|first = Shengzhe|date = 6 August 2014|work = Baker &amp; McKenzie Newsletter|accessdate = 26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication]] (SWIFT), many financial institutions are currently building up an RMB trade settlement, payments, foreign exchange, derivatives and clearing capabilities because the internationalization of the RMB has led to new sources of revenue for banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RMB internationalisation: Implications for the global financial industry|url=http://www.swift.com/assets/swift_com/documents/products_services/RMB_White_paper_internationalisation.pdf|publisher=[[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication]]|accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

The German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' criticized China for "forcing other countries to maintain reserves of Chinese money" in a bid to attain "economic [[hegemony]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exchange Rates and Reserve Currencies: China Plans Path to Economic Hegemony|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/exchange-rates-and-reserve-currencies-china-plans-path-to-economic-hegemony-a-741303.html|publisher=''[[Der Spiegel]]''|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon G. Chang]], author of ''[[The Coming Collapse of China]]'', argued that China’s "excessively selfish" currency policy does not sit well with other nations, and such efforts to loosen control of the renminbi is part of China's ploy to deflect international pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordon G.

The '''Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada''' ('''IIROC'''; ''Organisme Canadien de réglementation du commerce des valeurs mobilières'' or ''OCRCVM'' in French) is a non-profit, national [[self-regulatory organization]] (SRO). Established through the merger of the [[Investment Dealers Association of Canada]] (IDA) and [[Market Regulation Services Inc.]] (RS) on June 1, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osc.gov.on.ca/MarketRegulation/SRO/sro_index.jsp|title=Self-regulatory organizations (SROs) |publisher=[[Ontario Securities Commission]] |accessdate=2008-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  IIROC oversees all investment dealers and trading activity on debt and equity markets in [[Canada]].

The organization sets regulatory and investment industry standards and has quasi-judicial powers in that it holds enforcement hearings and has the power to suspend, fine and expel members and registered representatives, such as advisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investmentexecutive.com/client/en/News/DetailNews.asp?Id=45560&amp;cat=8&amp;IdSection=8&amp;PageMem=&amp;nbNews= |title=IIROC imposes $2 million fine on TD Waterhouse |first=Kate |last=Betts-Willmott |work=[[Investment Executive]] |date=2008-07-31 |accessdate=2008-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has often been criticized by investor advocates as ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investorvoice.ca/IDA/Comset/Comset_12Feb07.htm |title=Advocate flouts regulator |first=Gary |last=Norris |work=[[The Canadian Press]] |date=2007-02-12 |accessdate=2008-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

IIROC was formed on June 1, 2008 through the merger of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (IDA) and Market Regulation Services Inc. (RS).

The Bond Dealers Section of the [[Toronto Board of Trade]] was formed in 1916 as a trade organization to coordinate financing of Canada's war effort.  It was renamed the Investment Dealers Association of Canada in 1934.  Throughout most of its history, the IDA serve both as a regulator and as an advocacy organization for the securities dealers.  In 2006, IDA narrowed its focus to regulation and transferred its industry association role to a new separate and independent industry association, the Investment Industry Association of Canada.

Market Regulation Services Inc. was formed in 2008 in response to the implementation of National Instruments 21-101 ''Marketplace Operation'' and 23-101 ''Trading Rules'', which require an independent regulation services provider to regulate trading in all Canadian marketplaces, including the [[Toronto Stock Exchange|TSX]].

==Management==
Andrew J. Kriegler was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of IIROC on November 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://business.financialpost.com/2014/09/03/andrew-kriegler-iiroc/&lt;/ref&gt; Before joining IIROC, Kriegler was Deputy Superintendent at Canada's banking regulator, the [[Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (Canada)|Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions]], or OSFI, where he was responsible for supervising hundreds of federally regulated financial institutions.

Kriegler succeeds Susan Wolburgh Jenah, who headed IIROC's predecessor, the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (IDA) before becoming IIROC's first President and CEO in 2008. At the IDA, she had taken over the post from [[Joe Oliver (politician)|Joe Oliver]], who was alter elected as a Member of Parliament and went on to serve as federal [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]].

==Operations==
IIROC operates under Recognition Orders from the [[Canadian Securities Administrators]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investmentexecutive.com/client/en/News/DetailNews.asp?IdPub=163&amp;Id=44367&amp;cat=27&amp;IdSection=27&amp;PageMem=&amp;nbNews= |title=Long wait almost over for merged regulator |last=Langton |first=James |work=[[Investment Executive]] |date=May 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (CSA), which is the umbrella for Canada's provincial and territorial securities regulators. IIROC is subject to CSA oversight and regular operational reviews.

===Regulatory failures===
====Loss of unencrypted private investor data====
The CSA (Canadian Securities Administrators) investigated IIROC for the loss of personal financial data of thousands of brokerage clients after IIROC announced that it lost a mobile device containing the information.  The device had not been encrypted, which is in violation of IIROC policy.  The case reviewed IIROC's current policies, controls and procedures around information security.&lt;ref name="IE CSA Review"&gt;{{cite news | title = CSA reviewing IIROC data loss | publisher = [[Investment Executive]] | url = http://www.investmentexecutive.com/-/csa-reviewing-iiroc-data-loss | accessdate = 26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
More than 50,000 Canadian brokerage clients, from 32 investment firms, had personal financial information on the device.  At least one source has called the incident a cover up.&lt;ref name="FP Explanation"&gt;{{cite news | title = IIROC broke own rules by losing private data — can we believe its explanation | publisher = [[The Financial Post]] | url = http://business.financialpost.com/2013/04/29/iiroc-broke-its-own-rules-by-losing-data-device-can-we-believe-its-explanation/ | date = 29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charges against David Berry====
IIROC charged David Berry with securities law violations that were used by Scotiabank as grounds for his dismissal.  David Berry claims his dismissal and the reputation damage stemming from the IIROC charges have cost him $105M dollars. 
&lt;ref name="Scotiabank Fallout"&gt;{{cite news | title = Scotiabank explored fallout of cutting star trader's $15M pay months before he was fired, documents suggest | publisher = [[Financial Post]] | url = http://business.financialpost.com/2012/10/19/scotiabank-explored-fallout-of-cutting-star-traders-15m-pay-months-before-he-was-fired-documents-suggest/ |date = 19 Oct 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ruling on January 15, 2013, more than seven years after the initial accusation, a hearing panel of the IIROC dismissed all charges against Berry.
&lt;ref name="FP Broke Own"&gt;{{cite news | title = Former top Scotiabank trader cleared of allegations that led to his $100M wrongful dismissal lawsuit | publisher = [[The Financial Post]] | url =  http://business.financialpost.com/2013/01/15/iiroc-charges-against-david-berry-dismissed/ |date = 15 January 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charges against Blackmont Capital Inc. and Dean Shannon Duke====
In September 2010, IIROC contended that a Vancouver brokerage firm, Blackmont Capital Inc., and an employee, Dean Shannon Duke, acted against two IIROC rules in agreeing to share trading commissions with a third party.  In December 2010, IIROC imposed penalties on both Blackmont Capital and Duke for splitting commissions with people associated with a client without the client's written consent.  IIROC also imposed penalties for not disclosing the commission-sharing arrangement with its clients.  Blackmont Capital and Duke were assessed a total of $857,500 in fines by IIROC.&lt;ref name= blackmont/&gt;

In 2011, the British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) overturned IIROC's decision and penalties against Blackmont Capital and Duke.  A BCSC appeal panel contended that Blackmont and Duke's act of not disclosing their commission-sharing arrangement was not against public interest.  The BCSC reversed IIROC's verdict and the imposing of its fines.&lt;ref name="blackmont"&gt;{{cite news | title = Investment Industry Regulatory Organization deserves credit for decision in Blackmont Capital case | publisher = canada.com | url = http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=b666e47b-f235-4d9b-a75c-18580f245a2a |date = 5 Nov 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charges against Evergreen Securities CCO====
An Oct. 2012 IIROC Hearing Panel dismissed all allegations made by IIROC against Evergreen Capital Partners Inc. executives Loretta Carbonelli and Gerald T.Conway. 
&lt;ref name="IIROC News Release"&gt;{{cite news | title = IN THE MATTER OF Loretta Carbonelli and Gerald Trevor Conway - Allegations Dismissed | publisher = [[IIROC]] | url = http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1055453/in-the-matter-of-loretta-carbonelli-and-gerald-trevor-conway-allegations-dismissed |date = 18 October 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charges against Vic Alboini and Northern Securities Inc.====
In 2012, IIROC contended that activist investor, Vic Alboini, and two other executives at Northern Securities Inc. had improperly obtained credit for Jaguar Financial Corporation and had risked Northern Securities as a result.  IIROC penalized Alboini with a suspension of two years, a permanent ban from being an "ultimate designated person" and fines totaling $750,000.

Northern Securities appealed IIROC's decision to the [[Ontario Securities Commission]] (OSC).  The OSC overturned one count against Alboini and Northern Securities, namely that Alboini and Northern Securities had not corrected deficiencies found in IIROC compliance reviews.  The OSC also overturned IIROC's penalties against Alboini and Northern Securities, saying that IIROC should not have announced serious penalties at the same time as their decision.&lt;ref name="northern"&gt;{{cite news | title = IIROC won’t hold new hearing into compliance issues, Alboini says | publisher = [[The Globe and Mail]] | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/iiroc-wont-hold-new-hearing-into-compliance-issues-says-alboini/article16920727/ |date = 5 Nov 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charges against Carolann Steinhoff====
IIROC imposed charges against broker, Carolann Steinhoff.  Focusing on Steinhoff's activities between 2004 and 2007, IIROC contended that Steinhoff had instructed her assistants to falsify client documents and that she had obstructed IIROC investigations.  Part of IIROC's contentions related to Steinhoff's instruction to her assistant to cut and paste a client's signature from an existing form to an unsigned guarantee.

In 2011, the BCSC overturned IIROC's decision against Steinhoff.  In overturning IRROC's decision, the BCSC stated that IIROC's ruling against Steinhoff was not supported by the objective evidence, but was made on the basis of character evidence.  The BCSC panel also concluded that Steinhoff was entitled to defend herself and therefore overturned the charges against her for obstructing IIROC's investigation.&lt;ref name="steinhoff"&gt;{{cite news | title = Victoria-based broker Carolann Steinhoff’s punishment too harsh, BCSC rules| publisher = [[The Vancouver Sun]] | url = http://www.vancouversun.com/business/Victoria+based+broker+Carolann+Steinhoff+punishment+harsh+BCSC+rules/8765577/story.html |date = 8 Aug 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jurisdiction over former members dispute====
The organization has been involved in litigation over its power to discipline former members for their conduct while they were members. An [[Ontario Divisional Court]] decision in the matter of Stephen Taub ruled the [[Ontario Securities Act]] does not allow this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://secure.globeadvisor.com/servlet/ArticleNews/story/gam/20080723/LAWCOLUMN23 |first=Jacquie |last=McNish |title=Lawyer finds gaping hole in securities law. |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=2008-07-22 |accessdate=2008-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]] reached a different conclusion in the matter of [[Charles Dass]] and upheld a decision of the [[British Columbia Securities Commission]] that IIROC does have jurisdiction over former members.&lt;ref&gt;Investment Dealers Association of Canada v. Dass,  2008 BCCA 413&lt;/ref&gt; Later the [[Ontario Court of Appeal]] reversed the [[Divisional Court]] decision and reached the same conclusion as the British Columbia Court.&lt;ref&gt;[[Taub v. Investment Dealers Association of Canada]], 2009 ONCA 628&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Alberta]], provincial securities regulations state explicitly that self-regulatory organizations have the power to pursue enforcement activities with regards to former members.

The '''Italian Competition Authority''' ({{lang-it|Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato}}, '''AGCM''') is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Quango|quasi-autonomous non-governmental organization]] established on the basis of Law no 287 of 10 October 1990,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agcm.it/AGCM_ENG/NORMATIV/E_NORMNA.NSF/b50758bf27025fecc125653d00467db4?OpenView Law no. 287 of October 10th, 1990 (The Competition and Fair Trading Act)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001210035400/http://www.agcm.it/AGCM_ENG/NORMATIV/E_NORMNA.NSF/b50758bf27025fecc125653d00467db4?OpenView |date=December 10, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 100 years after the ''[[Sherman Antitrust Act]]''. As of 2004, the Italian Competition Authority has also been in charge of enforcing laws against conflicts of interest for Holders of Public Office.

As the Italian [[competition regulator]], the Authority has the task of enforcing both Italian and European consumer protection laws.

It is financed by annual allocations through a special chapter of the Ministry of Economic Development's budget. The Financial Law of 2006 introduced partial self-financing:&lt;ref&gt;Article 10(7-bis) of Law 287/90 as amended by article 1(69) of Law no. 266 of 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; ''AGCM'' has full control over the management of these funds for its own operations.

An annual report is presented to the [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy]].

==Duties==
The main duties of the authority are:
* Vigilance against abuses from [[Dominance (economics)|market dominance]].
* Vigilance against [[cartel]]s that may prejudice or restrict fair [[Competition (economics)|competition]] ([[Anti-competitive practices]]).
* Vigilance on [[takeover]]s to check [[concentration ratio]] and verify [[market impact]].
* [[Consumer protection]], against unfair trade practices and [[false advertising]].
* Supervise and penalize the cases of [[conflict of interest]] regarding members of [[Council of Ministers of Italy|Government of Italy]].

==Powers==
The Authority in such cases may conduct investigations or hearings, even with the [[Guardia di Finanza]] at his disposal, which may result in a warning or an administrative penalty.

'''José Antonio Ferré Aguayo''' (September 12, 1902 &amp;ndash; September 15, 1990) was a [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] businessman, industrialist and government official. He was a brother of [[Luis A. Ferré|Luis Ferré]], who served as [[Governor of Puerto Rico]], and [[Isolina Ferré]], the "[[Mother Teresa]] of Puerto Rico". Ferré was also the father of [[Maurice Ferré]], a former six-term mayor of [[Miami, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Hispanics in American Politics: The Search for Political Power | first=Maurilio E. | last=Vigil | year=1987 | page=102 | chapter=Hispanics in Local Office- State and Local Levels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Ferré was born in Ponce and the son of Cuban born Antonio Ferré Bacallao.&lt;ref name="Sarasota"/&gt; After attending [[Morristown-Beard School#History|Morristown-School]] (now Morristown-Beard School) in [[Morristown, New Jersey]], he earned his bachelor's degree in business administration at [[Boston University]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in 1924.&lt;ref name="congressional record"&gt;{{USCongRec|1990|E3220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferré later served on the Board of Trustees of the school alongside [[Edward Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | title=Boston U Names a Kennedy | date=21 October 1961}} "Edward M. Kennedy, youngest brother of President Kennedy, was one of three persons elected today to the Board of Trustees of Boston University. Other elected were Stephen P. Mugar of Belmont, President of the Star Market Company, and Jose A. Ferre, industrialist."&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his master's degree in business administration from the [[University of Miami]].&lt;ref name="congressional record"/&gt;

==Industrial development==

During the years following [[World War II]], Ferré grew his wealth by purchasing bankrupt glass, cement, and carton factories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45863">'''Labour Standards in the World Trade Organization''' are binding rules, which form a part of the [[jurisprudence]] and principles applied within the rule making institutions of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). Labour standards play an implicit, but not an overt role within the WTO, however it forms a prominent issue facing the WTO today, and has generated a wealth of academic debate.&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organization, Trade and Labour Standards: Subject of intense debate accessed 4/3/2007, http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/min99_e/english/about_e/18lab_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate about the extent to which the WTO should recognise labour standards is typically based on the principles found in Conventions of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), as well as mainstream human rights treaties, most prominently, the [[International Bill of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Includes [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|the Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR) and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) and its two protocols.&lt;/ref&gt;

== WTO Overview ==
{{main|World Trade Organization}}
The WTO is an international institution that deals with the rules of trade between countries with the view of [[List of Latin phrases (F–O)|inter alia]] "raising [[Standard of living|standards of living]], [and] ensuring full employment…".&lt;ref name="wto.org"&gt;World Trade Organization, 'Preamble', Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, par. 1 http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/04-wto.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved through a series of trade liberalising agreements based on consensus from the WTO's 164 members who form the General Council.&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organization, Understanding the WTO: The Organization, Members and Observers accessed 4/3/2007 http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org6_e.htm {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mqfQ6Tl4?url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/org6_e.htm |date=January 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The General Council, sitting as the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) has the jurisdictional power to solve disputes brought before it, and is able to approve trade restrictive measures to enforce compliance with agreements.&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organization, Understanding the WTO: Settling Disputes accessed 4/03/2007 http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/disp1_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The WTO's dispute settlement process is compulsory and the DSB's recommendations and rulings immediately become binding [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, J 2005, 'The Role of International Law in Trade', Georgetown Journal of International Law, Vol. 36; Iss. 3; pp 663, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the WTO===
The WTO has its origins in the 1944 [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods Conference]] which was convened by the Allied nations towards the end of World War II with the aim of establishing an international economic order. Although the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (now known as the World Bank) were created, the International Trade Organisation (ITO), the forerunner of the WTO, was only a proposition at this point. It was not until 1947 that negotiations were concluded and the ITO came into being. In the [[Havana Charter]], the text of the ITO, Article 7 pertained specifically to fair labour standards, requiring that members of the organisation must, amongst other things, "take fully into account the rights of workers under [[Intergovernmentalism|inter-governmental]] declarations, conventions and agreements" and recognise "that all countries have a common interest in the achievement and maintenance of fair labour standards related to productivity, and thus in the improvement of wages and working conditions as productivity may permit".&lt;ref&gt;Final Act of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment: Havana Charter for an International Trade Organisation Havana Charter accessed 4/3/2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the interim period before the ratification of the charter, states decided to follow an interim agreement, known as the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), which was to be later incorporated into the ITO's legal framework. This temporary arrangement did not include any references to [[Labor rights|labour rights]]. The requisite number of states failed to ratify the ITO and so it failed and GATT became the basis for the current world trade system.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"&gt;Wilkinson, R 1999, 'Labour and trade related regulation: beyond the trade-labour standards debate?', British Journal of Politics and [[International relations|International Relations]], vol.1, no.2, pp 165-191&lt;/ref&gt;

The WTO was established 1 January 1995 as a result of the [[Uruguay Round]] of negotiations (1986–1994). It was formed from the GATT, which became one of the core agreements annexed to the [[Marrakesh Agreement]], the document establishing the WTO. None of the other WTO agreements concluded at the end of the Uruguay Round include labour rights obligations. The effects of GATT are still felt and some commentators have described the WTO as the one major international governance organisation that does not examine the impact of its policies upon the ability of member states to advance human rights.&lt;ref name="Aaronson"&gt;Aaronson, S &amp; Zimmerman, J Nov 2006, 'Fair trade? How Oxfam presented a systematic approach to Poverty, Development, Human Rights &amp; Trade' [[Human Rights Quarterly]], vol.28, no. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|998, 1014}}

== Problems with the Current Approach ==
The WTO currently does not have jurisdiction over labour standards and the only place in which they are mentioned in the entire set of WTO Agreements is in GATT Article XX e) "relating to the products of prison labour".&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; Since the formation of the WTO in 1995 there have been increasing calls for action on the labour standards issue,&lt;ref&gt;Steve Hughes and Rorden Wilkinson (2000), "Labor standards and global governance: examining the dimensions of institutional engagement", Global Governance, 6: 2, pp. 259-277&lt;/ref&gt; and requests for a "human face on the world economy". The United Nations is among those bodies which have criticised the current system, and have called for a shift to a human rights oriented approach to trade, with steps to be taken "to ensure that human rights principles and obligations are fully integrated in future negotiations in the World Trade Organization",&lt;ref name="Realization_63"&gt;United Nations [[Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights]], The Realization of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: Globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of human rights, par.63 http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/(Symbol)/E.CN.4.Sub.2.2000.13.En?Opendocument&lt;/ref&gt; as the "primacy of [[human rights law]] over all other regimes of international law is a basic and fundamental principle that should not be departed from".&lt;ref name="Realization_63"/&gt; It is clear that states have both a legal and a [[moral obligation]] to uphold human rights standards, inclusive of their activities in the economic sphere. The United Nations (UN) Charter states that in "the event of a conflict between the obligations of the Members of the United Nations under the present Charter and their obligations under any other [[Treaty|international agreement]], their obligations under the present Charter shall prevail".'Charter of the United Nations', Chapter XVI, Article 103 of Charter. The UN Charter explicitly advocates the upholding of human rights and fundamental freedoms.'Charter of the United Nations', preamble, art. 62(2). This means that respect for human rights, and within this, labour standards, effectively trumps any conflicting WTO Agreements. However, not all [[World Trade Organization|WTO members]] are [[United Nations member states|members of the UN]] (e.g. Taiwan), which raises issues.

== Barriers to promoting labour standards ==
There are some major roadblocks to the process of recognising core labour standards within the WTO. Firstly, incorporating labour rights into the WTO is not simply a [[question of law]] and economics, but also of politics and ethics. Interplay between states and [[interest group]]s cloud the already complex issue further. Recognising human rights and specifically core labour standards in the WTO raises a series of thorny political, and in some cases moral, questions. Because each state is acting primarily according to its national interest, even technically viable solutions that could benefit the majority may become politicised. The highly democratic nature of the WTO compounds this problem because consensus needs to be reached before any major decisions are made, meaning each country effectively carries the power of veto, sometimes making it difficult to achieve real progress.

Secondly, this issue occurs at the intersection between trade and human rights which raises a series of unique questions. Although the trade and human rights regimes developed alongside each other following WWII, in some ways they are very different. This is because human rights law, unlike other types of international law that are more contractual in nature, governs how states treat their own citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Survey, Economist, 5 December 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Peace of Westphalia|Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648, sovereignty has been a key principle of the international system, with states being free from any higher [[Rational-legal authority|legal authority]] with the entitlement to exclusive, unqualified, and supreme rule within a delimited territory.&lt;ref&gt;Baylis, J. and Smith, S. 2005, The Globalisation of World Politics: An introduction to international relations, 3rd edition, [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] Press&lt;/ref&gt; The atrocities committed by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] in WWII however resulted in the establishment of a [[International human rights instruments|human rights regime]] where states have a [[responsibility to protect]] the rights of their citizens, and may be subject to international condemnation and even intervention if they fail to do so. Human rights law results in an unprecedented number of controls on domestic behaviour, "challenging the traditional legal concept of state sovereignty".&lt;ref name="Howse_Mutua"&gt;Howse, R &amp; Mutua, M 2000 Protecting Human Rights in a Global Economy: Challenges for the World Trade Organization, {{cite web |url=http://www.ichrdd.ca/english/commdoc/publications/globalization/wtoRightsGlob.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604111607/http://ichrdd.ca/english/commdoc/publications/globalization/wtoRightsGlob.html |archivedate=2009-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Free trade|Trade liberalisation]] on the other hand places constraints on [[domestic policy]] making ability, and the ability of states to fulfil their treaty obligations.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] 1999, Statement of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and [[Cultural rights|Cultural Rights]] to the Third Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization, par. 3&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is trade liberalisation that has led developing countries to deregulate in order to attract investment and retain a [[Sustainable competitive advantage|competitive advantage]]. The governments are therefore restricted in providing key workplace rights and satisfying core labour standards. This is known as the 'race to the bottom'.&lt;ref name="Eres_2004"&gt;Eres T 2004 'The Limits of GATT Article XX', Georgetown Journal of International Law, vol. 35, issue 3, pp 597-636&lt;/ref&gt; In simple terms, it is a phenomenon where interstate competition results in the progressive dismantling of regulatory standards, and in this case, those governing labour standards. In order to gain a comparative advantage and attract [[Foreign direct investment|foreign investment]], countries deregulate which leads to a decrease in working conditions and wages. The [[race to the bottom]] becomes a vicious circle with states competing to deregulate even further resulting in major human rights problems.

Many developing countries express their concern that labour standards will have a deleterious effect on their economy. The comparative wage advantage is an essential part of the world economic order so there is a general opposition to the incorporation of labour standards within the WTO.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; Developing countries also hold legitimate fears that the attempts to incorporate labour standards may be used as a thinly veiled protectionist measure. Tariffs can have a devastating effect on a developing economy. Although the threat of [[protectionism]] is valid and justified, in some cases it is just trade language being used to justify heinous human rights abuses such as [[Slavery|slave labour]] and exploitive forms of [[Child labor|child labour]].&lt;ref name="Howse_Mutua"/&gt; The recognition of labour standards in the WTO may "alienate Members who negotiated the agreement with different expectations"&lt;ref name="Eres_2004"/&gt;{{rp|619}} and cause further unrest. However a country is unlikely to leave the WTO altogether as the disadvantages of leaving the system would be too great.

== Mechanisms to Incorporate Core Labour Standards into the WTO ==
Taking these tensions into account, there are some possible ways to incorporate core labour standards into the WTO.

===Using the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade===
In theory, it is possible to use existing measures within the WTO to protect certain human rights. Within the WTO Agreements there are general exceptions (GATT Article XX) that can be used for the protection of specific human rights.&lt;ref&gt;"Recognizing that their relations in the field of trade and economic endeavour should be conducted with a view to raising standards of living, ensuring full employment…", Marrakech Agreement preamble&lt;/ref&gt; GATT Article XX paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) can be used to impose unilateral trade restrictive measures on countries&lt;ref name="Eres_2004"/&gt; for unacceptable labour standards. However, the wording of the exceptions has resulted in extreme difficulty for those who try to invoke trade measures, as is evidenced by 48 years of GATT where no country restricted trade through these sections.&lt;ref name="Aaronson"/&gt;{{rp|1014}} One of the reasons for this is that even when trade restrictive measures are successfully applied to a state, GATT Article 1, the principle of [[most favoured nation]] treatment, comes into play. This prescribes in essence, that any country which treats a state in a particular way then has to grant the same treatment to all other states. In regards to sanctions this means that if [[trade sanctions]] are applied to one country for a certain human rights abuse, they must then be applied to all countries who abuse the same right. This can have massive economic and political ramifications.

The political aspect of GATT Article XX aside, there are technical legal problems involved with invoking the clause in the first place. The wording in the relevant sections of GATT Article XX means that it must be proved that it is "necessary" to restrict a product in order to protect human, animal or plant life or health.&lt;ref&gt;GATT, Art XX (b)&lt;/ref&gt; For a state to legally take unilateral trade restrictive measures under these sections, the 'necessity test' must first be passed. There are three components. Firstly, it must be determined whether the interests protected are vital. Secondly, there is an assessment as to whether or not alternative measures are reasonably available and thirdly it is determined whether these alternate measures are less inconsistent with GATT (are the measures being proposed 'necessary' to combat the risk?). This means that a link must be established between both the targeted risk, the product being targeted and the trade measures being undertaken, with [[Legal burden of proof|the burden of proof]] is solely upon the party seeking to uphold the clause.&lt;ref&gt;US- Gasoline; EC- Asbestos, www.worldtradelaw.net&lt;/ref&gt; According to Black's [[Law dictionary]], 'necessary' does not have to carry the meaning 'indispensable' but can refer to the most appropriate or convenient option.&lt;ref name="Eres_2004"/&gt; In the Korea- Beef case it was taken to mean 'nearly indispensable',&lt;ref name="WTO_Korea"&gt;WTO [[Appellate Body]] Report, Korea- Measures Affecting Imports of Fresh, Chilled and Frozen Beef, WT/DS161, 169/AB/R, Par 156 (Dec.11, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and this definition has become a benchmark by which other cases are evaluated.&lt;ref name="Eres_2004"/&gt; Context is very important, and the greater the risk posed by a product the more lenience is granted when proving a link. For example, if there is a danger to human life, the evaluation is less stringent. However it is still extremely difficult to justify cases of labour standards abuse under GATT XX. Even if the necessity test is satisfied, the chapeau to Article XX must also be satisfied- the laws must not be applied in a manner so as to constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination, nor be a disguised restriction on international trade. This last requirement is particularly important because there is often a suspicion that the insertion of labour standards into free trade agreements/other measures, for example, are really disguised restrictions on trade.

Furthermore, the 'necessity test' ensures that only when the products themselves present a threat can they be restricted. Therefore, protecting labour rights through GATT Article XX is impossible, even if the production of the product may threaten human life. For example, the worst forms of child labour are a heinous practice which fall within the Article XX exception (b) yet children cannot be protected under this because it is their work conditions which are harmful, not the products themselves. In order to assist in removing constraints on states' ability to protect labour rights through GATT Article XX, the word 'necessary' should be replaced in Article XX(b) with 'relating to', as is used in GATT XX (c) and (g), or 'involving' as is the wording in (i).&lt;ref name="Eres_2004"/&gt; In the Korea- Beef case this was decided to be "more flexible textually", not requiring such stringent linkage.&lt;ref name="WTO_Korea"/&gt; This would allow trade measures to be implemented to combat labour standards with more ease, whilst ensuring that the exceptions are not used indiscriminately. However, due to the political concerns expressed above it would be quite difficult to amend the GATT, especially Article XX.

===Incorporation of a [[Social clause]]===
A solution that is widely talked about by some trade unionists and human rights groups is the incorporation of a social clause into the WTO Agreement.&lt;ref name="Greenfield_9"/&gt; Essentially, this means that the core labour standards would inserted into an article within the WTO Agreements which could be a more viable option than amendment of the Agreements themselves. If a state violated the social clause, the breach could become subject to WTO scrutiny, through the usual WTO dispute settlement provisions (provided provision is made for this when inserting a social clause). As a result of dispute settlement proceedings, the DSB could, at the request of the complaining party, recommend that retaliatory trade measures be taken against the offending country.&lt;ref name="Greenfield_9"/&gt; At first glance this might seem to be a good solution, as labour rights could not only be recognised, but enforced within the dispute settlement mechanisms of the WTO.

===Problems with Unilateral Trade Sanctions as an Enforcement Mechanism===
Within the international system it is difficult to enforce international law, particularly with regard to human rights. So using trade sanctions as a coercive measure is an appealing prospect to ensure cooperation. However, there are many reasons why trade sanctions are an inappropriate mechanism for enforcing labour standards. They are generally against WTO principles, and can only be used in very limited circumstances that are authorized by the WTO agreements, such as [[Dumping (pricing policy)|anti-dumping]] and countervailing measures. Politically, it is unlikely that unilateral action would be allowed for breaches of labour standards. Even assuming that labour standards are able to be enforced through trade measures within the WTO, either through amendments to GATT XX, the introduction of a social clause or any other measure, they do not provide a solution to the complexity of the labour standards issue and should not be used to deal with disputes over labour standards.&lt;ref&gt;WTO [[Director-general|Director General]] Renato Ruggeiro, World Trade Organization, 'WTO press brief: Trade and Labour standards' http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/min96_e/labstand.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Firstly, trade measures have the effect of constraining access to markets, which is why they are effective as a deterrent. However this may be counterproductive, resulting in developing countries becoming even poorer without helping the workers. "Trade sanctions are a blunt instrument, penalizing the country as a whole, not just those responsible for rights violations."&lt;ref name="UNDR_HDP"&gt;United Nations Development Programme, [[Human Development Report]] 2000: Human Rights and [[Human development (humanity)|Human Development]], Chapter 4, http://hdr.undp.org/reports/global/2000/en/&lt;/ref&gt; The linkage and inalienability between civil &amp; political, and economic, social &amp; cultural rights means that without a strong economic foundation, not only ICESCR rights are jeopardised, but ICCPR rights also. For example, in ensuring that [[civil and political rights]] such as the prohibition of [[Unfree labour|forced labour]] are protected, there must be sufficient funds available to legislate against this practice, and monitor and ensure that the legislation is carried out. Therefore, when a country is denied access to global markets, the resulting poverty can mean that the capability of the country to protect human rights is diminished, even if the political will is present. Not only may the government be affected, but individual businesses and workers may experience increased hardship as a result of [[trade barrier]]s. For example, wages may be lowered to retain a competitive edge,&lt;ref name="Flasbarth"&gt;Flasbarth, A. &amp; Lips, M., 'Effects of a Humanitarian World Trade Organization Social Clause on Welfare and North-South Trade flows', Aussenwirtschaft, Jun 2006, vol. 62 iss. 2 pp. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; which is the direct opposite of the intended effect of the sanctions.

Secondly, social clauses and the resulting sanctions are only applicable to export sectors. This causes considerable problems. For example, if sanctions were applied to the export sector because of the use of child labour, affected children would simply move into employment opportunities in the non-export sector (assuming full labour moveability).&lt;ref name="Flasbarth"/&gt; Working in the unregulated and non-accountable 'shadow economy' can lead to even worse conditions and human rights abuses. Studies show that child labour in the export sector is only 5% of overall child labour.&lt;ref name="UNDR_HDP"/&gt;{{rp|14}} Therefore, sanctions may not improve the situation at all and may force children into even worse working conditions. Because sanctions only apply to exported goods, abuse of core labour standards can occur domestically with few legal repercussions. One of the core conventions, that condemning forced labour, is blatantly violated in the US where prison inmates make [[Product (business)|commercial products]].&lt;ref name="Greenfield_9"/&gt; However, because they are supplied solely to the [[domestic market]], the WTO does not have jurisdiction and trade sanctions cannot be applied.&lt;ref name="Greenfield_9"/&gt;

Thirdly, poor labour standards are usually rooted in poverty and this is not something that sanctions can solve. If the [[root cause]] of the problem is not addressed and the a worker loses their job because of a heavy handed approach such as trade measures resulting in mass lay-offs, the family may lose its income and be plunged into greater poverty.

Furthermore, sanctions have the potential be used in an unfair way or for protectionist purposes. One reason for this is because when the DSB rules that trade sanctions are allowed in response to a violation of one of the agreements, it is up to the wronged country to choose what products it will restrict. This has seen the US restrict a variety of imports from [[European Union|the EU]] including telecommunications products and cheese, after winning a case in the WTO over bananas.&lt;ref name="Greenfield_9"/&gt; This is different from GATT XX in that the targeted product does not have to be directly related to the perceived threat. The problem with the indiscriminate restrictions of products is that it gives the complainant a huge amount of power which could lead to protectionism. Trade penalties can have a much larger effect on developing countries than developed. Although legally they have the same power as other nations, developing countries are at a disadvantage when it comes to pursuing trade measures because unilateral trade measures often have deleterious consequences for the punishing country as well as the offender.&lt;ref name="Eres_2004"/&gt; In addition, hostile regimes can gain control of the [[black market]] and charge exorbitant prices.&lt;ref name="Eres_2004"/&gt; Trade sanctions are not necessarily an effective way to deal with "wayward" governments as it simply gives them greater control of the countries resources.

===Furtherance of the WTO and ILO Relationship===
Although not a suitable long term solution, a way to break the current deadlock would be to further institutionalise the relationship between the WTO and ILO. The WTO Secretariat has some restricted interaction with the ILO "compiling statistics, research and technical assistance and training".&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organization, 'Work with other organisations: The WTO and International Labour Organization', http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/coher_e/wto_ilo_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Originally however, the ITO was supposed to have a strong working relationship with the ILO and "consult and co-operate" in all labour related matters, as well as cooperating in regards [[economic development]] and reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Final Act of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment: Havana Charter for an International Trade Organisation Havana Charter, Art 7:3 and Art. 10, http://www.worldtradelaw.net/misc/havana.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The current system is but a shadow of this, with very limited collaboration. When the issue of labour standards was raised at the 1996 Singapore Ministerial conference, Article 4 of the resultant Ministerial Declaration ruled that "the WTO and ILO Secretariats will continue their existing collaboration".&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organization 1996 'Singapore WTO Ministerial 1996: Ministerial Declaration WT/NIM(96)/DEC, http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/min96_e/wtodec_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Chairman of the Singapore Ministerial Conference Yeo Chow Tong later clarified in his concluding remarks that this collaboration "respects fully the respective and separate mandates of the two organisations".&lt;ref&gt;Par 8 Concluding remarks by H.E. Mr. [[Yeo Cheow Tong]] {{cite web |url=http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/tong-cn.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201142228/http://www.twnside.org.sg./title/tong-cn.htm |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Geneva Ministerial Conference, the US, EU and [[South Africa]] pushed again for a more substantive relationship between the two organisations which was opposed by a group of developing countries, led by Brazil. But despite the amount of controversy and discussion about the issue, the Ministerial Declaration failed to make a mention of it.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt;

The obvious reluctance of the WTO to deal with labour standards and the unlikelihood of recognition in this field in the near future means that the link between the WTO and ILO is crucial in regulating labour standards.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; However this relationship has never been formalised within the WTO and so will remain ineffective at best without proactive change. Within the Agreement Establishing the WTO, Article III 'Functions of the WTO' Par. 5 of reads: "With a view to achieving greater coherence in global economic policy-making, the WTO shall cooperate, as appropriate, with the International Monetary Fund and with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and its affiliated agencies." The ILO should be inserted into this section. Furthermore, in order to establish a formal, more meaningful relationship, a Ministerial Declaration should be written acknowledging the high level of cooperation and interconnectedness of the organisations, similar to the Ministerial Declarations regarding the relationship with the IMF and World Bank.&lt;ref&gt;Uruguay Round, Relationship of the World Trade Organization with the International Monetary Fund.&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of this relationship is that the ILO would not be undermined by the WTO, maintaining its authority in regards to labour standards. The mandates of each organisation would be respected, and there would be no recourse to trade sanctions whilst maintaining a degree of basic protection for labour rights.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; Collaboration between the ILO and WTO should also make use of the joint research facilities available, and a series of reports on labour rights should be created, similar to the ILO and WTO report "Joint Study on Trade and Employment",&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organization, '2007 News Items: WTO and Other Organisations', http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news07_e/ilo_feb07_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; but with a focus on labour standards. In the thinking of ILO Director General Michel Hansenne in the aftermath of the Singapore Ministerial Conference, a good working relationship could be established by pressuring states to ratify the relevant ILO conventions comprising the core labour standards.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; A scheme was established where those states who do not choose to ratify have to present a brief every 4 years "showing the extent to which effect has been given, or is proposed to be given, to any of the provisions of the Convention by legislation, administrative action, collective agreement or otherwise and stating the difficulties which prevent or delay the ratification of such Convention".&lt;ref&gt;International Labour Organization, 'Constitution' Art. 19.5 (e)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ILO is unable to enforce labour standards and can simply make recommendations, relying on moral suasion,&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; Hansenne's scheme once improved could lead to increased transparency and lead to regular discussion about labour standards, which is obviously to be desired. More regular reports, and increased pressure on non-ratifying state are necessary. Following the Singapore Ministerial Conference Hansenne further opined that it would be beneficial if a complaints committee were set up which could recommend that
(a) A case does not require further consideration
(b) The offending government rectify the labour standards abuse
(c) The matter be referred to the Fact-finding and Conciliation Commission of the ILO with the agreement of the offending government.
Unfortunately, the committee idea failed to gain support.

It has been suggested that another way in which to increase the importance of the relationship between the WTO and ILO is that countries wishing to join the organisation must first ratify the relevant ILO convention. Within the WTO, existing members set the standards of accession. However this use of [[double standard]]s is completely unjust, and does nothing to address the labour standard abuses of existing members. This is still no way of coercing uncooperative states into respecting core standards, and not including labour standards expressly within the WTO has the possible result of sidelining the issue&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; and so is no means an [[ideal solution]], but remains a worthy first step.

===Increased Civil Society Participation===
One suggestion for the improvement of the WTO system is to allow for increased [[civil society]] participation. This would result in the centralisation of [[social issues]], and within this, core labour standards. Furthermore, civil society groups are in an ideal position to put pressure on governments to uphold their human rights commitments, and monitor any progress in this field. Within civil society, [[Non-governmental organization|Non-Government Organisations]] (NGOs) would play a particularly crucial role. The term NGO passed into popular usage in the early 1970s and has come to mean a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit organisation]] that has specific objectives that is independent from the government, non-criminal, [[Nonviolence|non-violent]], not a political party.&lt;ref&gt;Castan Centre for Human Rights Law, Monash University&lt;/ref&gt; Within the UN under Article 71 there are 2,350 (2004) NGOs with [[Consultative Status|consultative status]]. This successful system has set a precedent for formalised NGO participation and should be used as a model for the WTO. There is provision for NGO participation within the WTO already under Article 5:2 'Relations with Other Organisations of the Marrakech Agreement': "The General Council may make appropriate arrangements for consultation and cooperation with non-governmental organizations concerned with matters related to those of the WTO". The WTO is a strictly [[International organization|intergovernmental organisation]], which means that civil society has no direct input, and much decision-making takes place behind closed doors. This system is appropriate when dealing with tariff reduction issues, but as large scale protests outside WTO meetings continue to demonstrate, social issues which concern civil society at large are forming a part of the WTO agenda. Globalisation means that decisions made at the WTO have come to affect everyone's lives, and hence there has been an increase in interest in the goings-on of the WTO by civil society. Allowing NGOs to have a say could increase transparency of the system, put pressure on non-compliant governments and provide specialist knowledge and support. Many organisations such as Oxfam, the [[International Confederation of Trade Unions]] and One World have already investigated the link between trade and labour standards- it does not make sense to ignore their expertise in this field. Unlike many domestic judicial systems, the WTO does not allow public scrutiny of proceedings, and it is this, rather than lack of any textual mechanism, that impedes NGO involvement.&lt;ref name="Howse_Mutua"/&gt; Forums are an effective way to allow NGOs to express their opinion and present information and regular forums should be held to discuss current, relevant issues. This idea has certainly won some support. In the aftermath of the Geneva Ministerial Conference in 1998, [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Bill Clinton]] said that "The WTO was created to lift the lives of ordinary citizens', it should listen to them. I propose the WTO, for the first time, provide a forum where business, labour, environmental and consumer groups can speak out and help guide further evolution of the WTO. When this body convenes again, I believe that the world's trade ministers should sit down with representatives of the broad public to begin this discussion".&lt;ref name="Clinton"&gt;Clinton, W, Remarks by the President to Opening Ceremony of the 1998 International Monetary Fund/ World Bank Annual Meeting, [[News release|media release]], http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/New/html/19981006-4644.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is not only NGOs who should have increased participation, but expert UN human rights bodies who are also highly proficient in exploring the trade and human rights intersection. For example, the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights has regrettably not been included in WTO processes.&lt;ref name="Clinton"/&gt;

===Recognition within the WTO Preamble===
One of the first steps to enforcing core labour standards is to acknowledge them explicitly within the WTO. Specific amendments to the body of the agreements on how to include labour standards within the WTO will take time as there are myriad proposed ways in which to do this. Therefore, incorporating the importance of labour standards into the preamble of the Agreement Establishing the WTO is an important action- with both symbolic and legal value. Although this does not place any binding obligations upon states to take immediate action on the labour standards issue, it can be used for the purposes of interpretation according to the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]]: "The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text... its preamble and annexes".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations 1969, 'Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties', Art. 31.2&lt;/ref&gt; There are oblique references to human rights already within the WTO preamble, but more explicit recognition is desirable. The importance of the preamble has been recognised by the Appellate Body report in many cases&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organization, 'WTO Analytical Index: Marrakesh Agreement' http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/wto_agree_01_e.htm#pB&lt;/ref&gt; so if labour rights were inserted into the preamble, the DSB when interpreting the agreements would be forced to take the preamble into account, and decisions with more favourable conclusions for labour rights would hopefully be passed down. So although this measure seems ineffective, once consensus has been established to include labour standards, this is one of the first steps that should be taken.

Incorporation of core labour standards into the preamble would also lead to the examination of human rights abuses through existing WTO review mechanisms. In 1988 the decision was made to make regular reviews of state's trade policy conducted by the WTO, a key part of the transparency of the organisation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;World Trade Organization, 'Understanding the WTO: The Agreements. Trade policy reviews: ensuring transparency', http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/agrm11_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Governments submit information to the WTO Secretariat who issue a report which is then examined by the General Council sitting as the Trade Policy Review Body. Government policies are reviewed in relation to the "functioning of the multilateral trading system" so as to encourage adherence to commitments under the agreements, and greater transparency.&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organization, 'Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization', Annex 3 Par. A&lt;/ref&gt; At present, the reviews are focusing solely upon the issue of trade liberalisation, and whether a member's policies support this. Although free trade is an important issue, it is not the overall objective of the multilateral trading system and should not be examined to the exclusion of all else. The real objectives of the WTO, with the aim of "raising standards of living, [and] ensuring full employment…"&lt;ref name="wto.org"/&gt; are conspicuously ignored. If labour rights were incorporated into the Marrakech Agreement Preamble, it would be even easier to address labour standards through the trade policy review mechanism.

One of the problems with the system is that the member state has the responsibility to supply the information to the WTO Secretariat. With no one checking on them, this could lead to problems however NGOs could play an important role in overcoming this. A second issue is that the regularity of reviews is calculated by a state's share of world trade. This means that the top 4 countries (the "Quad"): US, EU, Japan and Canada must review their policy every 2 years. The next 16 countries must submit reviews every four years and developing countries every 6 years.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Although the system may work currently, when it comes to human rights this is a problem. This is because the labour standards and human rights abuses of developing countries are no less egregious than those in [[Developed country|developed countries]] and so do not deserve to be monitored any less. Each state should have to submit a report addressing the "real" objectives of the WTO every 2 years or so, as well as a report addressing trade liberalisation according to the current system. By reporting on labour standards, the issue is opened to discussion, which can only be positive. Although states are not forced to act on any labour standards abuses that may be found within their territories, the public acknowledgement of their existence could provide fuel for human rights groups and victims. The very act of raising the labour standards issue is the first step because the power of shame should never be underestimated.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Survey, 'The power of shame', Economist, 5 December 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manthos Rizaris''' ({{lang-el|Μάνθος Ριζάρης}}, 1764–1824) and '''Georgios Rizaris''' ({{lang-el|Γεώργιος Ριζάρης}}, 1769–1842) were [[Greeks|Greek]] benefactors, merchants and members of the organization [[Filiki Eteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lyk-rizar.att.sch.gr/RIZAREIOIDRYMA.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430165541/http://lyk-rizar.att.sch.gr/RIZAREIOIDRYMA.htm |archivedate=2008-04-30 |df= }}(greek, english)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lyk-rizar.att.sch.gr/RIZAREIOIDRYMA.htm Biography, pictures of their bequests, and their testament] (Greek) {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430165541/http://lyk-rizar.att.sch.gr/RIZAREIOIDRYMA.htm |date=2008-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rizari brothers were born in the village of [[Monodendri (Ioannina)|Monodendri]] of [[Zagori]] region ([[Epirus]]). They lost both parents at an early age. Manthos Rizaris, the elder brother, moved to [[Moscow]], in order to work in his uncle’s trading business. At 1806 Georgios followed. They got involved in trade and made a fortune.

At 1817 Manthos became member of Filiki Eteria, and supported financially with huge amounts of money the [[Greek Revolution]]: a total donation of over 50.000 Russian rubles was offered for the Revolution’s objectives. Manthos, died at 1824 in Russia.

Both brothers supported the independence of Greece . With their financial aid helped: the poor, the orphans, the ones that suffered because of the armed conflicts that took place during this period. After Manthos’ death, Georgios moved to [[Odessa]], and continued his business there. He found in his home place (Monodendri) the ''School of Greek Courses'' (Greek: Σχολή των Ελληνικών Μαθημάτων). Many orphans were awarded with full scholarships, including full coverage of their living costs.

At 1837 George Rizaris settled in Athens, his goal was to found a Religious Institution in the newly formed [[Greece|Greek state]] that would prepare educated priests. At 1843 after his death, the Hieratical school has started to function. In gratitude for their contribution, the school, was named: [[Rizarios Hieratical School]]. The school continues to function as a religious and educational institution today and it is based in [[Halandri]], [[Athens]].

Moreover, they have founded a number of schools in their home place Monodendri and in Epirus region.
Their bequests continue to offer to Greek education and Greek Orthodox church.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28639">'''Mechanical screening''', often just called '''screening''', is the practice of taking [[Granule (geology)|granulated]] [[ore]] material and separating it into multiple [[Ore grade|grade]]s by [[particle size]].

This practice occurs in a variety of industries such as mining and [[mineral processing]], agriculture, pharmaceutical, food, plastics, and recycling.

[A method of separating solid particles according to size alone is called screening]

==General categories==
Screening fall under two general categories: dry screening and wet screening.  From these categories, screening separates a flow of material into grades, these grades are then either further processed to an intermediary product or a finished product. Additionally the machines can be categorised into moving screen and static screen machines, as well as by whether the screens are horizontal or inclined.

==Applications==
The mining and mineral processing industry uses screening for a variety of processing applications.  For example, after mining the minerals, the material is transported to a primary crusher.  Before crushing large boulder are scalped on a shaker with {{convert|0.25|in|mm|abbr=on}} thick shielding screening.  Further down stream after crushing the material can pass through screens with openings or slots that continue to become smaller.  Finally, screening is used to make a final separation to produce saleable products based on a grade or a size range.

==Process==
[[File:Screener model of process.jpg|thumb|Model of Screening Process]]
A screening machine consist of a drive that induces vibration, a screen media that causes particle separation, and a deck which holds the screen media and the drive and is the mode of transport for the vibration.

There are physical factors that makes screening practical.  For example, vibration, [[gravity|g force]], bed density, and material shape all facilitate the rate or cut.  [[Electrostatic force]]s can also hinder screening efficiency in way of water attraction causing sticking or plugging, or very dry material generate a charge that causes it to attract to the screen itself.

As with any industrial process there is a group of terms that identify and define what screening is.  Terms like blinding, contamination, frequency, amplitude, and others describe the basic characteristics of screening, and those characteristics in turn shape the overall method of dry or wet screening.

In addition, the way a deck is vibrated differentiates screens.  Different types of motion have their advantages and disadvantages.  In addition media types also have their different properties that lead to advantages and disadvantages.

Finally, there are issues and problems associated with screening.  Screen tearing, contamination, blinding, and dampening all affect screening efficiency.

==Physical principles==
*[[Vibration]] - either [[sinusoidal]] vibration or [[gyratory]] vibration.
**Sinusoidal Vibration occurs at an angled plane relative to the horizontal.  The vibration is in a wave pattern determined by frequency and amplitude.
**Gyratory Vibration occurs at near level plane at low angles in a reciprocating side to side motion.
*[[Gravity]] - This physical interaction is after material is thrown from the screen causing it to fall to a lower level.  Gravity also pulls the particles through the screen media.
*[[Density]] - The density of the material relates to material stratification.
*Electrostatic Force -  This force applies to screening when particles are extremely dry or is wet.

==Screening terminology==

Like any mechanical and physical entity there are scientific, industrial, and layman terminology.  The following is a partial list of terms that are associated with mechanical screening.
*Amplitude - This is a measurement of the screen cloth as it vertically peaks to its tallest height and troughs to its lowest point.  Measured in multiples of the acceleration constant ''g'' ([[g-force]]).
*Acceleration - Applied Acceleration to the screen mesh in order to overcome the van der waal forces
*Blinding - When material plugs into the open slots of the screen cloth and inhibits overflowing material from falling through.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darbywiremesh.com/wire-mesh-glossary.html Woven Wire Mesh Glossary of Terms&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Brushing - This procedure is performed by an operator who uses a brush to brush over the screen cloth to dislodged blinded opening.
*Contamination -  This is unwanted material in a given grade.  This occurs when there is oversize or fine size material relative to the cut or grade. Another type of contamination is foreign body contamination.
**Oversize contamination occurs when there is a hole in the screen such that the hole is larger than the mesh size of the screen.  Other instances where oversize occurs is material overflow falling into the grade from overhead, or there is the wrong mesh size screen in place.
**Fines contamination is when large sections of the screen cloth is blinded over, and material flowing over the screen does not fall through.  The fines are then retained in the grade.
**Foreign body contamination is unwanted material that differs from the virgin material going over and through the screen.  It can be anything ranging from tree twigs, grass, metal slag to other mineral types and composition.  This contamination occurs when there is a hole in the scalping screen or a foreign material's mineralogy or chemical composition differs from the virgin material.
*Deck - a deck is frame or apparatus that holds the screen cloth in place.  It also contains the screening drive.  It can contain multiple sections as the material travels from the feed end to the discharge end.  Multiple decks are screen decks placed in a configuration where there are a series of decks attached vertically and lean at the same angle as it preceding and exceeding decks.  Multiple decks are often referred to as single deck, double deck, triple deck, etc.
*Frequency - Measured in [[hertz]] (Hz) or revolutions per minute (RPM).  Frequency is the number of times the screen cloth sinusoidally peaks and troughs within a second.  As for a gyratory screening motion it is the number of revolutions the screens or screen deck takes in a time interval, such as revolution per minute (RPM).
*Gradation, grading - Also called "cut" or "cutting."  Given a feed material in an initial state, the material can be defined to have a particle size distribution.  Grading is removing the maximum size material and minimum size material by way of mesh selection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tpub.com/content/engine/14081/css/14081_454.htm Soil Gradation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091535/http://tpub.com/content/engine/14081/css/14081_454.htm |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Screen Media (Screen cloth) - it is the material defined by mesh size, which can be made of any type of material such steel, stainless steel, rubber compounds, polyurethane, brass, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitandquarry.com/lesson-7-screening/ Pit &amp; Quarry - Lesson 7 – Screening&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140310145342/http://www.pitandquarry.com/lesson-7-screening/ |date=2014-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Shaker - the whole assembly of any type mechanical screening machine.
*Stratification -  This phenomenon occurs as vibration is passed through a bed of material.  This causes coarse (larger) material to rise and finer (smaller) material to descend within the bed.  The material in contact with screen cloth either falls through a slot or blinds the slot or contacts the cloth material and is thrown from the cloth to fall to the next lower level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metsominerals.com/inetMinerals/mm_segments.nsf/WebWID/WTB-041223-2256F-10C45?OpenDocument Screening&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mesh -  The number of open slots per linear inch.  Mesh is arranged in multiple configuration.  Mesh can be a square pattern, long-slotted rectangular pattern, circular pattern, or diamond pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wovenwire.com/reference/woven-wire-mesh-wire-cloth-glossary.htm The Complete Wire Mesh Glossary of Terms&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Scalp, scalping - this is the very first cut of the incoming material with the sum of all its grades.  Scalping is removing the largest size particles.  This includes enormously large particles relative to the other particle's sizes.  Scalping also cleans the incoming material from foreign body contamination such as twigs, trash, glass, or other unwanted oversize material.

==Types of mechanical screening==

There are a number of types of mechanical screening equipment that cause segregation. These types are based on the motion of the machine through its motor drive.

*Circle-throw vibrating equipment -  This type of equipment has an eccentric shaft that causes the frame of the shaker to lurch at a given angle.  This lurching action literally throws the material forward and up.  As the machine returns to its base state the material falls by gravity to physically lower level. This type of screening is used also in mining operations for large material with sizes that range from six inches to +20 mesh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wstyler.on.ca/85.html WS Tyler » F-Class&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919205532/http://www.wstyler.on.ca/85.html |date=2007-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*High frequency vibrating equipment -  This type of equipment drives the screen cloth only.  Unlike above the frame of the equipment is fixed and only the screen vibrates.  However, this equipment is similar to the above such that it still throws material off of it and allows the particles to cascade down the screen cloth. These screens are for sizes smaller than 1/8 of an inch to +150 mesh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhewum.com RHEWUM WA- The original&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Gyratory equipment -  This type of equipment differs from the above two such that the machine gyrates in a circular motion at a near level plane at low angles.  The drive is an eccentric gear box or eccentric weights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engelsmann.com Engelsmann Separators and Screeners&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sweco.com/separators_sifters_screeners.html Sweco - Vibratory Screener, Sifters, Separators, Round Screen, Vibratory Separator&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Chemical_Tumbler_Screener.png|thumb|Chemical Tumbler Screener]]
*Trommel screens - Does not require vibrations, instead, material is fed into a horizontal rotating drum with screen panels around the diameter of the drum.

===Tumbler screening technique===
{{main|Tumbler screening technique}}

An improvement on vibration, vibratory, and linear screeners, a tumbler screener uses elliptical action which aids in screening of even very fine material. As like panning for gold, the fine particles tend to stay towards the center and the larger go to the outside. It allows for segregation and unloads the screen surface so that it can effectively do its job. With the addition of multiple decks and ball cleaning decks, even difficult products can be screened at high capacity to very fine separations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.almoprocess.com/content/tumbler-screeners |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821011917/http://almoprocess.com/content/tumbler-screeners |archivedate=2013-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circle-throw vibrating equipment===
{{main|Circle-Throw Vibrating Equipment}}

[[Circle-Throw Vibrating Equipment]] is a shaker or a series of shakers as to where the drive causes the whole structure to move.  The structure extends to a maximum throw or length and then contracts to a base state.  A pattern of springs are situated below the structure to where there is vibration and shock absorption as the structure returns to the base state.

This type of equipment is used for very large particles, sizes that range from pebble size on up to boulder size material.  It is also designed for high volume output. As a scalper, this shaker will allow oversize material to pass over and fall into a crusher such a cone crusher, jaw crusher, or hammer mill.  The material that passes the screen by-passes the crusher and is conveyed and combined with the crush material.

Also this equipment is used in washing processes, as material passes under spray bars, finer material and foreign material is washed through the screen.  This is one example of wet screening.

===High frequency vibrating equipment===
{{main|High Frequency Vibrating Equipment}}
High frequency vibrating equipment is a shaker whose frame is fixed and the drive vibrates only the screen cloth.  High frequency vibration equipment is for particles that are in this particle size range of an 1/8 in (3&amp;nbsp;mm) down to a +150 mesh.

These shakers usually make a secondary cut for further processing or make a finished product cut.

These shakers are usually set at a steep angle relative to the horizontal level plane.  Angles range from 25 to 45 degrees relative to the horizontal level plane.
[[File:Gyratory Screener.gif|thumb|Gyratory Screener]]

===Gyratory equipment===
{{main|Gyratory equipment}}

This type of equipment has an eccentric drive or weights that causes the shaker to travel in an orbital path.  The material rolls over the screen and falls with the induction of gravity and directional shifts.  Rubber balls and trays provide an additional mechanical means to cause the material to fall through.  The balls also provide a throwing action for the material to find an open slot to fall through.

The shaker is set a shallow angle relative to the horizontal level plane.  Usually, no more than 2 to 5 degrees relative to the horizontal level plane.

These types of shakers are used for very clean cuts.  Generally, a final material cut will not contain any oversize or any fines contamination.

These shakers are designed for the highest attainable quality at the cost of a reduced feed rate.

===Trommel screens===
{{main|Trommel screen}}

Trommel screens have a rotating drum on a shallow angle with screen panels around the diameter of the drum. The feed material always sits at the bottom of the drum and, as the drum rotates, always comes into contact with clean screen. The oversize travels to the end of the drum as it does not pass through the screen, while the undersize passes through the screen into a launder below.

==Screen Media Attachment Systems==

There are many ways to install screen media into a screen box deck (shaker deck). Also, the type of attachment system has an influence on the dimensions of the media.

===Tensioned screen media===
Tensioned screen cloth is typically 4 feet by the width or the length of the screening machine depending on whether the deck is side or end tensioned.  Screen cloth for tensioned decks can be made with hooks and are attached with clamp rails bolted on both sides of the screen box.  When the clamp rail bolts are tightened, the cloth is tensioned or even stretched in the case of some types of self-cleaning screen media. To ensure that the center of the cloth does not tap repeatedly on the deck due to the vibrating shaker and that the cloth stays tensioned, support bars are positioned at different heights on the deck to create a crown curve from hook to hook on the cloth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rocktoroad.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1932&amp;Itemid=134 Crown curve&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313004650/http://www.rocktoroad.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1932&amp;Itemid=134 |date=2014-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tensioned screen cloth is available in various materials: stainless steel, high carbon steel and oil tempered steel wires, as well as moulded rubber or polyurethane and hybrid screens (a self-cleaning screen cloth made of rubber or polyurethane and metal wires).

Commonly, vibratory-type screening equipment employs rigid, circular sieve frames to which woven wire mesh is attached. Conventional methods of producing tensioned meshed screens has given way in recent years to bonding, whereby the mesh is no longer tensioned and trapped between a sieve frame body and clamping ring; instead, developments in modern adhesive technologies has allowed the industry to adopt high strength structural adhesives to bond tensioned mesh directly to frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tensioned mesh sieves|url = http://www.robinsonwirecloth.co.uk/tensioned-mesh-sieves.html|website = Robinson Wire Cloth Ltd.|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modular screen media===
Modular screen media is typically 1 foot large by 1 or 2 feet long &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schenckprocess.com/site/screenex/products/Polyurethane-Modular-Screening-Systems.html Panels Dimensions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (4 feet long for ISEPREN WS 85 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.temaisenmann.com/%28S%28nztvbymhap5oxom5nrx0xv55%29A%28RTR6-qEDzgEkAAAANDk4OTk0MGItZGI4Zi00MWI5LThlNmEtZDM0ODcxZTI2NjdlINHvMedPqZ_pCwg2vcJqC7glRzw1%29%29/handbook/pdfs/WS-851.pdf ISEPREN WS 85  brochure&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;) steel reinforced polyurethane or rubber panels. They are installed on a flat deck (no crown) that normally has a larger surface than a tensioned deck. This larger surface design compensates for the fact that rubber and polyurethane modular screen media offers less open area than wire cloth. Over the years, numerous ways have been developed to attach modular panels to the screen deck stringers (girders).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandemproducts.com/tandem/product_info.php?products_id=136&amp;XTCsid=pxzopbfobcdlscel Modular panels types&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313002019/http://www.tandemproducts.com/tandem/product_info.php?products_id=136&amp;XTCsid=pxzopbfobcdlscel |date=2014-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these attachment systems have been or are currently patented.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?tbm=pts&amp;hl=fr&amp;q=Screen+and+screen+element#hl=fr&amp;q=vibrating+screen+panel&amp;tbm=pts Google Patent - vibrating screen panel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Self-cleaning screen media is also available on this modular system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://majorwire.cc/en/products/flex-mat-3-modular Flex-Mat 3 Modular&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Screen Media==
There are several types of screen media manufactured with different types of material that use the two common types of screen media attachment systems, tensioned and modular.

===Woven Wire Cloth ([[Mesh]])===
Woven wire cloth, typically produced from stainless steel, is commonly employed as a filtration medium for sieving in a wide range of industries. Most often woven with a plain weave, or a twill weave for the lightest of meshes, apertures can be produced from a few microns upwards (e.g. 25 microns), employing wires with diameters from as little as 25 microns. A twill weave allows a mesh to be woven when the wire diameter is too thick in proportion to the aperture. Other, less commonplace, weaves, such as Dutch/Hollander, allow the production of meshes that are stronger and/or having smaller apertures.

Today wire cloth is woven to strict international standards, e.g. ISO1944:1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ISO 9044:1999 - Industrial woven wire cloth -- Technical requirements and tests|url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=28424|website = www.iso.org|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which dictates acceptable tolerance regarding nominal mesh count and blemishes. The nominal mesh count, to which mesh is generally defined is a measure of the number of openings per lineal inch, determined by counting the number of openings from the centre of one wire to the centre of another wire one lineal inch away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Glossary|url = http://www.robinsonwirecloth.co.uk/glossary.html|website = Robinson Wire Cloth Ltd.|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a 2 mesh woven with a wire of 1.6mm wire diameter has an aperture of 11.1mm (see picture below of a 2 mesh with an intermediate crimp). The formula for calculating the aperture of a mesh, with a known mesh count and wire diameter, is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;a = \left ( \frac{25.4}{b} \right ) - c&lt;/math&gt;

where a = aperture, b = mesh count and c = wire diameter.

[[File:Woven wire mesh.png|alt=Woven wire mesh|thumb|2 mesh with an intermediate crimp]]
Other calculations regarding woven wire cloth/mesh can be made including weight and open area determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Woven wire mesh calculator|url = http://www.robinsonwirecloth.co.uk/calculator.html|website = Robinson Wire Cloth Ltd.|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of note, wire diameters are often referred to by their [[standard wire gauge]] (swg); e.g. a 1.6mm wire is a 16 swg.

Traditionally, screen cloth was made with metal wires woven with a loom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.haverboecker.com/en/the-company/about-us/our-history/ Haver &amp; Boeker history&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313001927/https://www.haverboecker.com/en/the-company/about-us/our-history/ |date=2014-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/majorwire/photos/a.220200571325256.71666.133575833321064/226528134025833/?type=1&amp;theater 19th century’s product book page 1 from Major Wire&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/majorwire/photos/a.220200571325256.71666.133575833321064/226528227359157/?type=1&amp;theater 19th century’s product book page 2 from Major Wire&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, woven cloth is still widely used primarily because they are less expensive than other types of screen media. Over the years, different weaving techniques have been developed; either to increase the open area percentage or add wear-life.  Slotted opening woven cloth&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.okutanikanaami.co.jp/img/second/kanaami/toncap03-b.jpg Photo of a slotted opening woven wire cloth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is used where product shape is not a priority and where users need a higher open area percentage. Flat-top woven cloth&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weavingideas.net/us/applications-products/industrial-wire-screens/screen-sections/weave-types-according-to-iso-47833.html Weave Types (see type E for Flat Top)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313002335/http://www.weavingideas.net/us/applications-products/industrial-wire-screens/screen-sections/weave-types-according-to-iso-47833.html |date=2014-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is used when the consumer wants to increase wear-life. On regular woven wire, the crimps (knuckles on woven wires) wear out faster than the rest of the cloth resulting in premature breakage. On flat-top woven wire, the cloth wears out equally until half of the wire diameter is worn, resulting in a longer wear life. Unfortunately flat-top woven wire cloth is not widely used because of the lack of crimps that causes a pronounced reduction of passing fines resulting in premature wear of con crushers.

===Perforated &amp; Punch Plate===
On a crushing and screening plant, punch plates or perforated plates&lt;ref&gt;[http://samscreen.com/product/replacement-punch-plate-screen/ Perforated Plate &amp; Punch Plate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; are mostly used on scalper vibrating screens, after raw products pass on grizzly bars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aggregatesandminingtoday.com/improving-the-standard-grizzly-screen,2010-1,823,0,0,featured-story.aspx Grizzly Screen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most likely installed on a tensioned deck, punch plates offer excellent wear life for high-impact and high material flow applications.

===Synthetic screen media (typically rubber or polyurethane)===
Synthetic screen media is used where wear life is an issue. Large producers such as mines or huge quarries use them to reduce the frequency of having to stop the plant for screen deck maintenance. Rubber is also used as a very resistant high-impact screen media material used on the top deck of a scalper screen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockland.com/images/snap_graniterock_mar99.jpg Photo of a scalper screen with tensioned rubber panels&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216225336/http://rockland.com/images/snap_graniterock_mar99.jpg |date=2014-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To compete with rubber screen media fabrication, polyurethane manufacturers developed screen media with lower Shore Hardness. To compete with self-cleaning screen media that is still primarily available in tensioned cloth, synthetic screen media manufacturers also developed membrane screen panels, slotted opening panels and diamond opening panels. Due to the 7-degree demoulding angle, polyurethane screen media users can experience granulometry changes of product during the wear life of the panel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hub-4.com/news/6262/flex-mat-3-modular-locking-system-options-significantly-increase-open-area-without-costly-screen-box-modifications “7-degree demolding angle results in its openings widening as soon as the top surface is worn”&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-Cleaning Screen Media===
Self-cleaning screen media was initially engineered to resolve screen cloth blinding, clogging and pegging problems. The idea was to place crimped wires side-by-side on a flat surface, creating openings and then, in some way, holding them together over the support bars (crown bars or bucker bars). This would allow the wires to be free to [[vibration|vibrate]] between the support bars, preventing blinding, clogging and pegging of the cloth. Initially, crimped longitudinal wires on self-cleaning cloth were held together over support bars with woven wire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meister-siebe.de/en/screens/wire-cloths/harp-screen-type-b.html “Self-Cleaning” woven wire cloth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 50s, some manufacturers started to cover the woven cross wires with caulking or rubber to prevent premature wear of the crimps (knuckles on woven wires).  One of the pioneer products in this category was ONDAP GOMME made by the French manufacturer Giron.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giron.fr/english/screen-mesh/Anti-clogging.htm Giron’s Anti-clogging products&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid 90s, Major Wire Industries Ltd., a Quebec manufacturer, developed a “hybrid” self-cleaning screen cloth called Flex-Mat, without woven cross wires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hub-4.com/news/s1/4112/flex-mat-vibrating-wire-technology-celebrates-15th-anniversary Flex-Mat 15th anniversary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In this product, the crimped longitudinal wires are held in place by polyurethane strips. Instead of locking (impeding) the vibration over the support bars with woven cross wires, the polyurethane strips lessens the vibration of the longitudinal wires over the support bars but does not stop it, consequently allowing vibration from hook to hook.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agg-net.com/news/major-wire-make-it-a-double Hook to hook vibration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Major Wire quickly started to promote this product as a high-performance screen that helped producers screen more in-specification material for less cost and not simply a problem solver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aggman.com/flex-mat%C2%AE-3-increases-throughput-of-spec-product-while-solving-blinding-pegging-and-clogging-problems/ "Flex-Mat® 3 Increases Throughput While Reducing Downtime"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They claimed that the independent vibrating wires helped produce more product compared to a woven wire cloth with the same opening (aperture) and wire diameter. This higher throughput would be a direct result of the higher vibration [[frequency]] of each independent wire of the screen cloth (calculated in [[hertz]]) compared to the shaker vibration (calculated in [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]]), accelerating the stratification of the material bed. Another benefit that helped the throughput increase is that hybrid self-cleaning screen media offered a better open area percentage than woven wire screen media. Due to its flat surface (no knuckles), hybrid self-cleaning screen media can use a smaller wire diameter for the same aperture than woven wire and still lasts as long, resulting in a greater opening percentage.

'''Mystery shopping''' (related terms: '''mystery consumer''', '''secret shopper''') is a tool used externally by [[market research]] companies, watchdog organizations, or internally by companies themselves to measure [[quality of service]], or [[regulatory compliance|compliance with regulation]], or to gather specific information about products and services. The mystery consumer's specific identity and purpose are generally not known by the establishment being evaluated.

Mystery shoppers perform specific tasks such as purchasing a product, asking questions, registering complaints or behaving in a certain way, and then provide detailed reports or [[feedback#In organizations|feedback]] about their experiences.

==Development==
Mystery shopping was standard practice by the early 1940s as a way to [[employee monitoring|measure employee integrity]]. Tools used for mystery shopping assessments range from simple [[questionnaire]]s to complete [[sound|audio]] and [[video]] recordings. Mystery shopping can be used in any industry, with the most common venues being [[retailing|retail stores]], hotels, [[movie theater]]s, restaurants, [[fast food]] chains, banks, gas stations, [[car dealership]]s, apartments, [[health club]]s and health care facilities.

Since 2010, mystery shopping has become abundant in the [[medical tourism]] industry, with healthcare providers and medical facilities using the tool to assess and improve the customer service experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novasans.com/content,Mystery-Shopping---New-Trend-in-Medical-Tourism.html Mystery shopping new trend in Medical Tourism, Novasans] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617053549/http://www.novasans.com/content,Mystery-Shopping---New-Trend-in-Medical-Tourism.html |date=June 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], mystery shopping is increasingly used to provide feedback on customer services provided by local authorities, and other [[non-profit organization]]s such as [[housing association]]s and churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/shropshire/7257717.stm |title=Mystery worshippers test church |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-02-21 |accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth==
The mystery shopping industry had an estimated value of nearly $600 million in the [[United States]] in 2004, according to a 2005 report commissioned by the Mystery Shopping Providers Association (MSPA). Companies that participated in the report experienced an average growth of 11.1 percent from 2003 to 2004, compared to an average growth of 12.2 percent. The report estimates more than 8.1 million mystery shops were conducted in 2004. The report represents the first industry association attempt to quantify the size of the mystery shopping industry. The Independent Mystery Shoppers' Coalition reports there are 1.5 million mystery shoppers in the United States alone. Similar surveys are available for [[Europe]]an regions where mystery shopping is becoming more embedded into company procedures.

As a measure of its importance, customer/patient satisfaction is being incorporated more frequently into [[executive pay]]. A study by a U.S. firm found more than 55% of hospital chief executive officers surveyed in 2005 had "some compensation at risk," based on patient satisfaction, up from only 8% to 20% a dozen years ago."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115499684792929340 Health Care Taps 'Mystery Shoppers'] at ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', August 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, a ''Mystery Shoppers Practitioners' Group'' has been established under the auspices of the Market Research Society.&lt;ref&gt;	Morrison, L. J., Colman, A. M., &amp; Preston, C. C., "Mystery customer research: Cognitive processes affecting accuracy," ''Journal of the Market Research Society,'' Vol. 39, 1997, pp 349-361.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 [http://about.americanexpress.com/news/pr/2011/csbar.aspx survey] by the American Express company found a clear correlation between a company's attention to customer service and customers' willingness to pay more for good service.

[[CBC Television]]'s news magazine program ''[[Marketplace (Canadian TV program)|Marketplace]]'' ran a segment on this topic during a January 2001 episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/pre-2007/files/services/mysteryshoppers/ |title=Mystery shopping: Billion dollar industry keeps retailers in check |publisher=Cbc.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
Mystery shopping organizations advise that their research should only be used for employee incentive programs and that punishment or firing is an inappropriate use of mystery-shopper data. However, stories of employees being fired as a direct result of negative mystery shopper feedback are not uncommon.&lt;ref name="newinquiry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/the-secret-shopper/ |title=The Secret Shopper |publisher=The New Enquiry |date=June 4, 2012 |accessdate=September 7, 2012 |author=Osterweil. Willie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trade Organization for Mystery Shopping Providers, MSPA has defined a Code of Professional Standards and Ethics Agreement for Mystery Shopping Providers and for Mystery Shoppers. Other organizations that have defined standards for Mystery Shopping are ESOMAR, MRS and MRA. The most widely used set of professional guidelines and ethics standards for the Market Research industry is [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]

In the state of Nevada, mystery shoppers must be licensed by the PILB board and work under a company that has a [[private investigators license]] in order to perform mystery shopping jobs. Unlicensed mystery shoppers may face fines.

In June 2008, the [[American Medical Association]]'s Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs released a recommendation on the use of "secret shopper patients". The Recommendation: "Physicians have an ethical responsibility to engage in activities that contribute to continual improvements in patient care. One method for promoting such quality improvement is through the use of secret shopper 'patients' who have been appropriately trained to provide feedback about physician performance in the clinical setting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/38/a08cejoreports.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - CEJA Opinions and Reports.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2009, the council decided to withdraw the report "in light of further testimony heard at the 2008 Interim Meeting [of the AMA House of Delegates]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 9-A-09 Secret Shopper Patients|url = http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/our-people/ama-councils/council-ethical-judicial-affairs/ceja-reports.page|website = www.ama-assn.org|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Economic Protectionism Association''' (NEPA) is the oldest local [[non-government organization]] in the [[Philippines]] having been established in 1934. The non-government organization was established by Filipino industrialists with the intention of protecting domestic industries, owned by Filipinos, against dominion by foreign interests and competition. Through the years of its existence, it has gone through a number of leadership changes and policy tacks. During its heyday, its leaders held key positions in the government and were actively promoting Filipino industries. It has offices at Francesca Towers, along [[Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] (EDSA) in Diliman, [[Quezon City]]. In the 21st century, NEPA is under revitalization with mass organizing and networking with other Filipino organizations. From local organizations of [[small and medium enterprises]] (SMEs) and Filipino industrialists to [[inventor]]s societies and producers. From a network of nationalist government officials and employees to ordinary Filipino [[consumer]]s. It is a registered non-stock, non-profit private organization founded by 15 pioneering Filipino entrepreneurs and industrialists. NEPA has always been an active participant in the formulation of national economic policies. NEPA fosters the spirit of economic nationalism and national industrialization, and promotes the protection of Filipino interests in the country's polity, economy, culture and environment.

NEPA in History

== History ==
* '''Beginning'''
The crusade for political independence stimulated a parallel campaign for economic freedom in early 1900s. In 1903, Ang Bagong [[Katipunan]] was organized to promote "economic nationalism" and "economic self-sufficiency" among the Filipinos. The movement had a brief but colorful existence. Nevertheless, the flame of economic nationalism continue to spread as the people's aspiration for national independence intensified in the 1920s.

* '''The Chamber of Commerce of the Philippine Islands'''
The Chamber of Commerce of the Philippine Islands, composed of Filipino businessmen, carried on the movement after the demise of Bagong Katipunan. In 1926, the Chamber issued a manifesto entitled "Ours First, Yours Later", urging the people to patronize locally-made products.

* '''Founding'''
NEPA was born out of the historic necessity to hasten the industrial development of the colony in preparation for its acquisition of independence under the [[Tydings–McDuffie Act]], signed on March 24, 1934. Centuries of Spanish rule and three decades of [[free trade]] under the [[United States|Americans]] made the Philippines dependent on the outside world for almost every manufactured commodity — from [[toothpick]]s to [[Nail (fastener)|nails]]! In early 1934, the Chamber of Commerce created a committee tasked with promoting Filipino products on a more sustained basis. In August of that year, the Chamber sponsored the "Made-in-the-Philippines Week" to popularize local products. It also organized the National Congress of Filipino Businessmen. On November 19, 1934, the Chamber's initiative gave birth to NEPA in a founding meeting held at Club Filipino.

* '''Founding officers'''
The founders were: Antonio Brias, Salvador Araneta, Isaac Ampil, Florencio Reyes, Benito Razon, Arsenio N. Luz, Joaquin Elizalde, Leopoldo R. Aguinaldo, Vicente Villanueva, Toribio Teodoro, Gonzalo Puyat, Ramon J. Fernandez, Ciriaco Tuazon, Aurelio Periquet, Sr., and Primo Arambulo.

* '''Rise of the movement'''
Right after its founding, NEPA launched a nationwide campaign to promote economic protectionism. Provincial, municipal and student chapters were created all over the country. Popular meetings and assemblies, attended by thousands of Filipinos, were held in different parts of the country. "NEPA" became a trademark and a symbol of pride of Philippine-made products.

* '''The war years'''
World War II disrupted the work of NEPA. However, the pre-war consciousness-raising efforts of NEPA regarding self-reliance made it easier for individual entrepreneurs and families to produce essential commodities out of locally available materials.

* '''Post-war revival'''
NEPA was revived in late 1948 under the leadership of Senator Gil J. Puyat. In the 1950s, the entrepreneurs and firms associated with NEPA spearheaded the great industrial drive that developed around the program of [[import controls]] and [[foreign exchange controls]]. The rapid industrial transformation of the Philippines made her the envy of her Asian neighbors. During this period, NEPA founded the Home Industries Association of the Philippines, Filipino Inventors Society, Philippine Hatter's Association and Philippine Standards Association.
The decade ended with NEPA becoming the main pillar of the "Filipino First" program of President Carlos P. Garcia.

* '''Difficulties of 1960s'''
The decade of the 1960s saw the [[Diosdado Macapagal|Macapagal]] administration putting an end to the "Filipino First" policy. Decontrols, [[Philippine peso|peso]] [[devaluation]] and an open door to foreign investors became the order of the day. This policy reversal, formulated by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and implemented by a rising group of so-called [[technocrat]]s, was continued in the first term of President [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]].

* '''Crisis of the 1970s'''
In the 1970s, the Philippines literally became an [[open economy]] — open to foreign capital, foreign loans and foreign economic advisers. Filipino capitalists were relegated to junior partners under the policy of [[Manual labour|labor]]-intensive, [[export]]-oriented, [[Multinational corporation|transnational]]-dependent industrialization. This induced economic slowdown, which was exacerbated by the [[Floating exchange rate|floating]] of the [[US dollar]] in August 1971. As a result, the Asian currencies collapsed.

* '''NEPA and the 1980s'''
Against the backdrop of IMF-[[World Bank]] domination of the economy, NEPA started redefining its role in the changed economic situation.

;1st Conference on Economic Independence
On August 23, 1980, it organized the 1st Conference on Economic Independence, which reaffirmed that "political independence can only be meaningful in terms of the welfare of the whole nation, if our national economy is free from the control of foreign interests." The Conference expressed grave concern over the "operation of the World Bank and other international financial institutions in the Philippines which primarily benefit transnational corporations and their home countries, to the detriment of Filipino businessmen, consumers, workers and peasants, and other sectors of our society."

;2nd Conference on Economic Independence
The above theme was reiterated in the 2nd Conference on Economic Independence organized in December 1983, which was held in the midst of the worst economic crisis ever experienced by the country. The Conference called for a renewal of NEPA and its transformation, once again, into a nationwide movement aimed at the promotion of genuine economic independence. In late 1984, NEPA gained another 50-year extension of its corporate life. Its leadership declared its firm resolve to push NEPA once again in the struggle to promote economic nationalism so that the Filipino shall at last be the sole determinant and principal beneficiary of the nation's economic development.

;Renaissance
The year 1986 saw the renaissance of a new NEPA. It fought for the protection of our national patrimony in the Constitutional Commission, a just debt re-scheduling scheme and capping of debt service, agrarian reform and import rationalization. NEPA stood for nationalist development and industrialization to fight massive poverty. In mid-1986, NEPA launched its mass organization known as Kilusang Pilipino Muna which renewed the call for the patronage of Filipino-made products and services. The late 1980s saw NEPA initiating the organization of the Freedom from Debt Coalition (FDC) and the Movement for Nationalist Industrialization (MNI).

* '''NEPA and the 1990s'''
NEPA once again vowed to be at the forefront of the struggle to promote and protect the economic interests of the Filipino people.

;NEPA Manifesto
In preparation for this renewed organizational vigor, NEPA conducted a series of workshop-meetings in 1991 which culminated in the adoption of the "NEPA Manifesto" better known in its title "NEPA Vision of Development – Capitalism and Nationalism: The Missing Partnership" on December 10, 1992.

;Organization and projects
This was capped by an operational planning workshop on December 29, 1992, which resulted in the adoption of the new NEPA organization system and the approval of several projects such as the revival of the Bureau of Economic Research, organization of the Information Resource Center, NEPA Training Center (which will be transformed later into the NEPA School of Business &amp; Economics), Business Development &amp; Management Center, NEPA Awards for Outstanding Entrepreneurs (first conducted in the 1970s), establishment of NEPA corporations and cooperatives, and the strengthening of NEPA Confederation by organizing city and municipal chapters, as well as faculty/student chapters in schools, colleges and universities throughout the country.

;Campaign for economic nationalism
In mid-1990s, NEPA renewed its campaign to promote economic nationalism and new protectionism. However, the spirited NEPA plan was never pursued. The association was eclipsed by the dreamlike economic upswing coupled with a strong anti-protectionist campaign by elite business groups and bureaucrat capitalists. At that point in time, the government predicted that the Philippines would reach a [[newly industrialized country]] (NIC) status by the year 2000. In October 1996, however, NEPA insisted that the economic ascent was a mercurial upsurge. NEPA declared firmly that "if we take a closer look at the more important economic indicators, the country is not dramatically improving. The balance of trade is rising, there is still massive unemployment and underemployment, the per capita income has not increased significantly as compared to GNP growth, and the purchasing power of the peso has been stifled." NEPA re-echoed its fears that "unless certain economic fundamentals are changed, the l990s — like the l980s — might turn out to be another lost decade for the Philippines." In mid-1997, the Asian currencies plunged deeper than the 1971 fall.

;1998 presidential campaign
At the height of the 1998 presidential campaign, most candidates were still parroting the four-fold economic policies of indiscriminate globalization, unproductive liberalization, ineffective privatization and unwieldy deregulation. NEPA maintained that the continuity of these economic policies would perpetuate the economic crises the country had been experiencing since the early 1970s. The economic decline in the last three years of the 1990s confirmed NEPA's prognostication.

;Organizational hiatus
NEPA experienced organizational hiatus in late 1990s and the year 2000. Its directorial board deserted and membership dwindled—saddled with economic downtrend combined with NEPA's organizational inactivity and a silent debate on maintaining "protectionism" as its pivotal concern.

;NEPA Junior
The need for a sustainable campaign and existence of the organization has given birth to the creation of NEPA Junior as the youth wing of the organization. In 2011, NEPA organized student chapters in colleges and universities in [[Metro Manila]] to raise awareness among studenty on the need for economic nationalism in the Philippines. The following year, on November 24, 2012, a new milestone of the organization was made with the formal launching of NEPA Junior at Balagtas Hall of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. Hundreds of students from various colleges and universities from [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]] converged in the event.

== The 21st century ==
Looking more closely at two important economic sectors in the current decade of the 2000s, NEPA notes that the country's manufacturing sector is not only sluggish, it continues to decline; while the agricultural sector remains uncompetitive with decreasing productivity, and worse, its sustainability is going down.

* '''Focus of development'''
Economists of some presidential candidates for the 2010 elections contend that development should focus on the service sector which employs 45% of the work force. NEPA points out that the growth of the service sector can only be sustained by accelerating the development of manufacturing industry and the rapid modernization of agriculture. NEPA, however, emphasizes that the economy can only attain sustainable growth by balancing the development of agriculture, industrial manufacturing and the service industry. The continuity of existing 30-year-old economic policies, NEPA maintains, will perpetuate the economic crises the country has been experiencing since the early 1970s. NEPA also observes that all indicators show the next administration will continue to promote the interest of big businesses and multi-national corporations. NEPA believes this will kill local manufacturing industries, particularly the small and medium enterprises, and soon, retail trade will be in the hands of foreign companies. NEPA suggests that the next administration should critically analyze the current economic programs and development policies. The new president should creatively explore new economic programs that will promote the creation of domestic manufacturing enterprises, enhance the modernization of agriculture, and sustain the growth and quality of the service industries.

* '''Looking back and moving forward'''
During the first two years of the [[Corazon Aquino|Aquino]] administration, its economists predicted the country would be an industrialized nation by the end of her term. Officials of the [[Fidel V. Ramos|Ramos]] government made a more upbeat prediction: the status of a [[newly industrialized country]] (NIC) for the Philippines by the year 2000. The [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo|Macapagal-Arroyo]] administration also made the same prediction using the label "Strong Republic". Industrialization (or NIC-hood) means achieving an annual growth rate of at least 7–8 per cent throughout the decade. It also means halving the double-digit unemployment rate and raising the national per capita income from the subsistence level of $700 to a more decent $2,000 or more. NEPA shares the aspiration for national industrialization, which has been completely forgotten by the presidency of [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]. Moreover, NEPA wants the national march to industrialization to be measured not only in terms of the rising average per capita income but also, and more importantly, in the general reduction of absolute and relative poverty of the masses, estimated by various studies to be affecting between 65 and 80 per cent of the population.

* '''NEPA's resolutions'''
NEPA is less optimistic that the nation will achieve the desired economic targets and the overall goal of industrialization beginning in the year 2010 and onwards. In fact, NEPA fears that, unless certain economic fundamentals are changed, the decade of the 2010s – like the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s – might turn out (as usual) to be another lost decade for the Philippines. Finally, NEPA resolved: 
# To promote an alternative all-out industrialization based on economic Filipinism to achieve self-sufficiency and self-sustaining growth
# To oppose the imposition of the external forces that seek to dominate the economy and exploit the people and national resources
# To promote a sense of nationalism among the people, a sense of belonging to each other, a sense of common purpose and common destiny, a national pride that make the improbable a reality... a Corporate Philippines or "Philippines, Inc."

== Major policy positions ==
* Increased state investment in and promotion of local manufacturing, more state support for small and medium-size entrepreneurs in the form of increased and relaxed credit windows and technical support;
* Review of export processing charters with the view of putting into place stringent import substitution and technology transfer requirements for locators in various export processing zones in the country;
* Immediate suspension and review of all tariff reduction commitments that had negative impact on agriculture and local manufacturing industries;

== History ==
Chowdhary and Gadihoke started working together as students at [[The Mother's International School, New Delhi|The Mother's International School]], as part of their computer club, [[The Mother's International School, New Delhi#Computer club|MINET]], of which Chowdhary was [[President (corporate title)|President]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beingindian.com/bi-viral/delhi-teens-thoughtful-us-want-device-reading-app-dyslexic/|title=WOW!

'''Recruitee''' is [[Software as a service]] (Saas) that functions as an [[applicant tracking system]] (ATS). It includes a careers site editor for [[employer branding]], a plugin for [[sourcing (personnel)]], [[job board]] integration, email and calendar [[synchronization]]. Within 4 months after its public launch in August 2015, Recruitee attracted over 1000 [[small and medium-sized enterprises]] (SMEs) and recruiting agencies worldwide.

== History ==

In 2011, Perry Oostdam met Pawel Smoczyk on [[Founder2be]], a [[social network]] that helps aspiring [[entrepreneurs]] find their [[co-founder]]. Working remotely from the [[Netherlands]] and [[Poland]], they put together their first product - a mobile activation [[game]] called GeoRun.&lt;ref name="recruitee founders"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@PerryDam/the-u-turn-of-our-startup-ae50e6599b03/  |title=The U-turn of Our Startup|date=9 December 2015 |publisher=[[Medium.com]]|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Oostdam and Smoczyk pivoted the business and built Recruitee out of their own frustration with the hassles of [[Recruitment|hiring]].&lt;ref name="recruitee pivot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.saas-invaders.co/perry-oostdam-the-story-of-a-successful-pivot/ |author=Tom Benattar |title=Perry Oostdam - The Story of A Successful Pivot|date=11 September 2015 |publisher=SaaS Invaders|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe hiring should be a team effort, not only for founders and HR alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hinchliffe|first1=Tim|title=Recruitee: Smart Hiring on the Cloud co-Founder Interview|url=http://sociable.co/business/recruitee-smart-hiring/|website=Sociable.co|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recruitee Makes Hiring Easy On the Cloud|url=http://thestartupmag.com/recruitee-makes-hiring-easy-cloud/|website=Startup Magazine|accessdate=3 October 2016|date=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its launch, Recruitee quickly became popular and got an undisclosed amount of seed funding in September 1, 2015. Its board members include Dutch entrepreneurs Robert Pijselman and Luc Brandts.&lt;ref name="fjfdfb advisory board"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iamwire.com/2015/09/recruitee-com-seed-funding/122314/ |author=Sujata Sangwan |title=Hiring Platform Recruitee.com Raises Seed Round of Funding|date=8 September 2015 |publisher=iamWire|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Recruitee announced a partnership with Rockstart, an accelerator in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="talent pool partner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockstart.com/blog/introducing-talent-pool/|author=Catherine |title=Introducing Talent Pool|date=20 November 2015|publisher=Rockstart|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recruitee set up a Talent Pool that let applicants apply to job openings from all startups that are and were affiliated with Rockstart.

Recruitee's current clients include [[Vice (magazine)]], Usabilla, and [[Vlisco]].&lt;ref name="clients"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.co/recruitee-recruiting-software-to-hire-the-best-talent-2016-02 |title=Recruitee: A Recruiting Software to Hire the Best Talent|date=5 February 2016|publisher=Tech Cocktail|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

Users can [[drag and drop]] candidates' profiles to different stages as they move along the [[Recruitment|hiring process]].&lt;ref name="engadget review"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/08/08/this-is-the-hiring-tool-all-modern-teams-should-have/ |author=Diogo Costa |title=This is the Hiring Tool All Modern Teams Should Have|publisher=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can post job openings to free and paid [[job board]]s from Recruitee.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4448">'''Reset''' is an evolving military term currently used to describe the equipment refurbishment process. In current U.S. [[military]] terms, "reset" refers to "a series of actions to restore units to a desired level of combat capability commensurate with future mission requirements."&lt;ref name="anderson1"&gt;[http://armedservices.house.gov/pdfs/joint013107/multi%20testimony013107.pdf "Readiness Committee Written Statement." Brigadier General Charles A. Anderson]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context specific terminology==
The military term is somewhat like [[Reset (finance)|the financial term "reset"]], which is a generic concept in the financial world.  Reset, which also known as ''fixing,'' is a generic concept in the [[financial markets]] which refers to the determination and recording of a [[reference rate]], usually in order to calculate the settlement value of a periodic payment schedule between two parties.

The military term is somewhat like [[Reset (computing)|the computing term "reset"]], which means to clear any pending errors or events and bring a system to normal condition or initial state.

The military term "reset" is unlike its finance and computing counterparts in that the military usage anticipates three related components: repairing, replacing and recapitalizing.  Military reset, in simplest terms, is intended to reverse the effects of stress on all equipment.  Initial funding from Congress was used to reset brigade combat teams involving about 4,000 soldiers and about 40,000 pieces of equipment returning from duty in Afghanistan and Iraq.&lt;ref name="anderson1"/&gt; 

===Repair===
Repair starts with an inspection followed by maintenance and possible replacement of some parts to bring equipment to original technical specifications.&lt;ref name="anderson1"/&gt; 

===Replacement===
Replacement means to buy new or to replace equipment destroyed in battle or otherwise too damaged to fix. Also listed under replacement is reserve-component equipment which has been left overseas for other units to use.&lt;ref name="anderson1"/&gt; 

===Recapitalizing===
Recapitalizing involves overhauling or restoring equipment to improve performance or make it like new from the factory.&lt;ref name="anderson1"/&gt; 

Timely funding would be designed to allow military depots to order repair parts in advance of equipment arrival.”&lt;ref&gt;Gilmore, Gerry J. [http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=2895  "Army’s Equipment ‘Reset’ Program Ahead of 2006 Pace,"] American Forces Press Service. February 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic reset==
* [[Strategic reset]] is a policy framework designed to strengthen the United States' stance throughout the Middle East.&lt;ref name="strategic1"&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/strategic_reset.html Center for American Progress: "Strategic Reset"] retrieved 27 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The plan for strategic reset entails four key measures:
* Acknowledging Iraq's [[politics of Iraq|political]] and [[demography|demographic]] fragmentation.&lt;ref name="strategic1" /&gt;
* Implementing prompt [[phased redeployment|phased military redeployment]].&lt;ref name="strategic1" /&gt;
* Establishing local and regional methods for improving security and [[diplomacy]] in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="strategic1" /&gt;
* Developing a functional strategy to resolve the [[Arab-Israeli Conflict|Arab–Israeli Conflict]].&lt;ref name="strategic1" /&gt;

In 2007, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' described as "strategic reset" a proposal by U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] that took the form of "an unusually detailed public explanation of the new American effort to create a de facto alliance between Israel and moderate Arab states against Iranian extremism."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/25/AR2007012501555.html "Rice's Strategic Reset." ''Washington Post'' 26 Jan 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sheet moulding compound''' ('''SMC''') or '''sheet moulding composite''' is a ready to mould [[Fiberglass|glass-fibre reinforced polyester]] material primarily used in [[compression moulding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whelan |first=A. |year=2012 |title=Polymer Technology Dictionary |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |page=391 |isbn=9789401112925}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sheet is provided in rolls weighing up to 1000&amp;nbsp;kg. Alternatively the resin and related materials may be mixed on site when a producer wants greater control over the chemistry and filler.

SMC is both a process and reinforced composite material.  This is manufactured by dispersing long strands (usually &gt;1”) of chopped fiber (commonly [[glass fiber]]s or [[carbon fiber]]s on a bath of [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]] resin (commonly [[polyester resin]], [[vinyl ester resin]] or [[epoxy resin]])). The longer fibers in SMC result in better strength properties than standard [[bulk moulding compound]] (BMC) products. Typical applications include demanding electrical applications, corrosion resistant needs, structural components at low cost, automotive, and transit. 

==Process==
Paste reservoir dispenses a measured amount of specified resin paste onto a plastic carrier film.  This carrier film passes underneath a chopper which cuts the fibers onto the surface. Once these have drifted through the depth of resin paste, another sheet is added on top which sandwiches the glass.  The sheets are compacted and then enter onto a take-up roll, which is used to store the product whilst it matures.  The carrier film is then later removed and the material is cut into charges.  Depending on what shape is required determines the shape of the charge and steel die which it is then added to.  Heat and pressure act on the charge and once fully cured, this is then removed from the mould as the finished product. Fillers both reduce weight and change the physical properties, typically adding strength. Production challenges include wetting the filler, which could consist of glass microspheres or aligned fibers rather than random chopped fibers; adjusting die temperature and pressure to provide the proper geometry; and adjusting chemistry to end use.

==Advantages==
Compared to similar methods, SMC benefits from a very high volume production ability, excellent part reproducibility, it is cost effective as low labor requirements per production level is very good and industry scrap is reduced substantially.  Weight reduction, due to lower dimensional requirements and because of the ability to consolidate many parts into one, is also advantageous.  The level of flexibility also exceeds many counterpart processes.

==Physical properties==
Properties vary depending upon fiber and resin types.
* Impact Strength: 8–13&amp;nbsp;ft·lbf/in
* Flex Strength: 18-34 KPSI (120-230 MPa)
* Flex Mod: 1500-2100 KPSI (10-15 GPa)
* Tensile Strength: 8-18 KPSI (55-125 MPa)
* Compressive Strength: 24-32 KPSI (165-220 MPa)
* HDT @ 264 PSI: &gt;500°F

'''Stock dilution''', also known as equity dilution,  is the decrease in existing [[Shareholder|shareholders]]’ ownership of a company as a result of the company issuing new [[Equity (finance)|equity]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.capshare.com/blog/dilution-101-startup-guide-equity-dilution/|title=Dilution 101: A Startup Guide to Equity Dilution with Real-World Statistics - Capshare Blog|date=2016-10-18|newspaper=Capshare Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; New equity increases the total [[shares outstanding]] which has a dilutive effect on the ownership percentage of existing shareholders.  This increase in the number of [[shares outstanding]] can result from a primary market offering (including an [[initial public offering]]), employees exercising [[employee stock options|stock options]], or by issuance or conversion of [[convertible bond]]s, [[preferred shares]] or [[warrant (finance)|warrants]] into stock. This dilution can shift fundamental positions of the stock such as ownership percentage, voting control, [[earnings per share]], and the value of individual shares.

==Control dilution==
Control dilution describes the reduction in ownership percentage or loss of a controlling share of an investment's stock. Many [[venture capital]] contracts contain an anti-dilution provision in favor of the original investors, to protect their equity investments. One way to raise new equity without diluting voting control is to give warrants to all the existing shareholders equally. They can choose to put more money in the company, or else lose ownership percentage. When employee options threaten to dilute the ownership of a control group, the company can use cash to [[Share repurchase|buy back]] the shares issued.

The measurement of this percent dilution is made at a point in time. It will change as market values change and cannot be interpreted as a "measure of the impact of" dilutions.
 
#Presume that all convertible securities are convertible at the date.
#Add up the number of new shares that will be issued as a result.
#Add up the proceeds that would be received on these conversions and issues (The reduction of debt is a 'proceed').
#Divide the total proceeds by the current market price of the stock to determine the number of shares the proceeds can buyback.
#Subtract the number bought-back from the new shares originally issued
#Divide the net increase in shares by the starting # shares outstanding.

==Earnings dilution==
Earnings dilution describes the reduction in amount earned per share in an investment due to an increase in the total number of shares. The calculation of earnings dilutions derives from this same process as control dilution. The net increase in shares (steps 1-5) is determined at the beginning of the reporting period, and added to the beginning number of shares outstanding. The [[net income]] for the period is divided by this increased number of shares. Notice that the conversion rates are determined by market values at the beginning, not the period end. The returns to be realized on the reinvestment of the proceeds are not part of this calculation.

==Value dilution==
Value dilution describes the reduction in the current price of a stock due to the increase in the number of shares. This generally occurs when shares are issued in exchange for the purchase of a business, and incremental income from the new business must be at least the [[return on equity]] (ROE) of the old business. When the purchase price includes goodwill, this becomes a higher hurdle to clear.

The theoretical diluted price, i.e. the price after an increase in the number of shares, can be calculated as:

:Theoretical Diluted Price = &lt;math&gt;\frac{(O \times OP) + (N \times IP)}{O + N}&lt;/math&gt;
Where:
*O = original number of shares
*OP = Current share price   
*N = number of new shares to be issued
*IP = issue price of new shares

For example, if there is a 3-for-10 issue, the current price is $0.50, the issue price $0.32, we have
* O = 10, OP = $0.50, N = 3, IP = $0.32, and
* TDP = ((10x0.50)+(3x0.32))/(10+3) = $0.4585

===Owners' share of the underlying business===
If the new shares are issued for proceeds at least equal to the pre-existing price of a share, then there is no negative dilution in the amount recoverable. The old owners just own a smaller piece of a bigger company. However, voting rights at stockholder meetings are decreased.
 
But, if new shares are issued for proceeds below or equal to the pre-existing price of a share, then stock holders have the opportunity to maintain their current voting power without losing net worth.

===Market value of the business===
Frequently the market value for shares will be higher than the [[book value]]. Investors will not receive full value unless the proceeds equal the market value. When this shortfall is triggered by the exercise of employee stock options, it is a measure of wage expense. When new shares are issued at full value, the excess of the market value over the book value is a kind of internalized capital gain for the investor. He is in the same position as if he sold the same % interest in the secondary market.

Assuming that markets are efficient, the market price of a stock will reflect these evaluations, but with the increase in shareholder equity 'management' and prevalence of barter transactions involving equity, this assumption may be stretched.

Preferred share conversions are usually done on a dollar-for-dollar basis. $1,000 face value of preferreds will be exchanged for $1,000 worth of common shares (at market value). As the common shares increase in value, the preferreds will dilute them less (in terms of percent-ownership), and vice versa. In terms of value dilution, there will be none from the point of view of the shareholder. Since most shareholders are invested in the belief the stock price will increase, this is not a problem.

When the stock price declines because of some bad news, the company's next report will have to measure, not only the financial results of the bad news, but also the increase in the dilution percentage. This exacerbates the problem and increases the downward pressure on the stock, increasing dilution. Some financing vehicles are structured to augment this process by redefining the conversion factor as the stock price declines, thus leading to a "[[Death spiral financing|death spiral]]".

==Impact of options and warrants dilution==
Options and warrants are converted at pre-defined rates. As the stock price increases, their value increases dollar-for-dollar. If the stock is valued at a stable [[price-to-earnings ratio]] (P/E) it can be predicted that the options' rate of increase in value will be 20 times (when P/E=20) the rate of increase in earnings. The calculation of "what percentage share of future earnings increases goes to the holders of options instead of shareholders?" is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retailinvestor.org/truths.html#dilutedEPS|title=Retail Investor .org : Understanding changes to Owners' Equity - Investor Education|website=www.retailinvestor.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2015|reason=WP:USERGENERATED}}

:'''''(in-the-money options outstanding as % total) * (P/E ratio) = % future earnings accrue to option holders'''''

For example, if the options outstanding equals 5% of the issued shares and the P/E=20, then 95% (= 5/105*20) of any increase in earnings goes, not to the shareholders, but to the options holders.

==Share dilution scams==
A share dilution scam happens when a company, typically traded in unregulated markets such as the [[OTC Bulletin Board]] and the [[Pink Sheets LLC|Pink Sheets]], repeatedly issues a massive number of shares into the market (using [[follow-on offering]]s) for no particular reason, considerably devaluing share prices until they become almost worthless, causing huge losses to shareholders.

Then, after share prices are at or near the minimum price a stock can trade and the share float has increased to an unsustainable level, those fraudulent companies tend to [[reverse split]] and continue repeating the same scheme.

== Investor-backed private companies and startups ==
Stock dilution has special relevance to investor-backed private companies and startups. Significantly dilutive events occur much more frequently for private companies than they do for public companies. These events happen because private companies frequently issue large amounts of new stock every time they raise money from investors.    

Private company investors often acquire large ownership stakes (20%-35%) and invest large sums of money as part of the [[venture capital]] process. To accommodate this, private companies must issue large amounts of stock to these investors. The issuance of stock to new investors creates significant dilution for founders and existing shareholders.  

Company founders start with 100% ownership of their company but frequently have less than 35% ownership in the later-stages of their companies' life cycles (i.e., before a sale of the company or an IPO).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; While founders and investors both understand this dilution, managing it and minimizing it can often be the difference between a successful outcome for founders and a failure.  As such, dilutive terms are heavily negotiated in venture capital deals.

[[File:Portrait of Thomas Beale - George Chinnety (cropped).JPG|thumb|Portrait of Thomas Beale by [[George Chinnery]]]]
'''Thomas Beale''' (c. 1775&amp;ndash;1841), was a Scottish naturalist, opium speculator and general merchant operating in the [[Far East]] during the 19th century.

==Biography==
Thomas was the younger brother of [[Daniel Beale]] and the cousin of [[Thomas Chaye Beale]].&lt;ref name="OPC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gwulo.com/sites/gwulo.com/.../Gwulo-Macau-Old-Protestant-Cemetery.pdf|title=Old Protestant Cemetery in Macau|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is first mentioned as one of the five unofficial foreign residents in [[Canton (Guangzhou)|Canton]] in 1796 as secretary to his older brother who was the [[Prussia]]n consul.&lt;ref name=RIDE&gt;
{{Cite book|last1=Ride|first1=Lindsay|first2=May|last2=Ride|first3=Bernard (ed.)|last3=Mellor

 | isbn=978-962-209-384-3
}} p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas later became consul in his own right and served from 1798 until at least 1814. Both brothers were partners in the trading firm of [[Hollingworth Magniac|Magniac &amp; Co.]], which dealt in goods including opium, cotton and tea. The Prussian consulship eventually devolved upon [[Jardine Matheson Holdings|Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co.]] through [[Hollingworth Magniac]].&lt;ref name="RIDE" /&gt;

Known for his hospitality, Beale's mansion in Macao included a garden with 2,500 potted plants and an aviary that became a must-see for Western visitors to Macau. The {{Convert|40|by|20|ft|m}} aviary contained hundreds of rare birds from China, Europe, Southeast Asia, and South America.  George Vachell, chaplain to the [[East India Company]] described a visit during which he saw about six hundred birds to his friend [[John Stevens Henslow]], [[Regius Professor of Botany (Cambridge)|Professor of Botany at Cambridge University]] and mentor to [[Charles Darwin]]. When the missionary cum naturalist [[George Bennett (missionary)|George Bennett]] stopped in Macau during his Pacific voyage, Beale's garden and aviary made such an impression that he devoted forty-five pages of his travelogue to describing their contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fan|first=Fa-ti|title=British Naturalists in Qing China: Science, Empire, and Cultural Encounter|publisher=Cambridge, MA and London: Harvard University Press|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdFstTce_F0C&amp;pg=PA44}} pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt; The house was described by a contemporary as "one of the finest of the old Portuguese houses ... on a narrow street known as Beale's Lane".&lt;ref&gt;Ride, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Of Beale's aviary, contemporary visitor [[William Wightman Wood]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;in particular I may mention the [[bird-of-paradise]]. A splendid living specimen is in the possession of Mr. Beale almost domesticated. It feeds from the hand of its amiable owner without fear, and appears capable of being rendered perfectly tame and familiar. This is perhaps the only specimen at present existing in confinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Sketches_of_China.html?id=yDQOAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Sketches of China: with illustrations from original drawings|year=1830|last=[[William Wightman Wood|Wood, William Wightman]]|publisher=Carey &amp; Lea, Philadelphia}} p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After offering opium [[Futures contract|futures]] as security for loans in a falling market and investing millions of dollars in illicit deals in Brazil, he ended up owing the East India Company some 800,000 [[Peso#1821–1897 Mexican dollar|dollars]]. In 1816, Thomas was declared insolvent in the "most sensational bankruptcy of the period".&lt;ref name="RIDE" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Coates|first=Austin|title=Macao and the British, 1637–1842|publisher=China; OUP|isbn= 978-0-19-582782-8}} pp. 140–141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cheong|first=W.E.|title=The Hong merchants of Canton: Chinese merchants in Sino-Western trade|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-7007-0361-6}} p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

Bankruptcy notwithstanding, Thomas' amiability made him Lady Elizabeth Napier's favourite &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Napier|first=Priscilla|title=Barbarian Eye|year=1995|publisher=Brassey's}} p.138, Lady Napier's letter, 19 August 1834&lt;/ref&gt; among the Europeans in Macau in 1834 and he later subscribed 20 pounds sterling for a memorial to her husband the late [[William Napier, 9th Lord Napier|William John, Lord Napier]], first Chief Superintendent of Trade at Canton, so appointed following the abolition of the East India Company's monopoly on Far Eastern trade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fQrmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=thomas+beale+canton&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d1lfZReGTC&amp;sig=I2rUFkMFcyWf2SLzlmsn2OheWIs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HrrmTaeGCIOIvgOS9uTjCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20beale%20canton&amp;f=false ''Canton Register'', Tuesday, February 25, 1835]&lt;/ref&gt;

The body of Thomas was found washed ashore at Casilha Bay, near Macau in January 1841,&lt;ref name="OPC" /&gt; after he allegedly committed suicide.&lt;ref name="RIDE" /&gt;

==Types of Business License==

The types of Business Licenses issued in Dubai and other emirates in United Arab Emirates (UAE) are professional, commercial and industrial. The professional license covers services offered by professionals, artisans and craftsmen; the commercial license covers all trading and commercial activities performed with an intention of making profit ; the industrial license covers all industrial and manufacturing activities. The type of license depends on the business activity of the company or enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baijumasoodu.com/articles/details/39|title=Types of Business License|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurisdiction of the Company==

In UAE, a company can be formed in any of the following three jurisdictions: Mainland, Free Zone and Offshore. The licensing authority in mainland is the Department of Economic Development of the respective emirates. In Free Zones, the relevant Free Zone Authority will be the licensing authority and respective Offshore Authority in the case of Offshore jurisdiction.

==Legal Forms of Business==
The common legal forms of business in the UAE are:
* [[Sole proprietorship]]
* Civil Company
* [[Limited liability company|Limited Liability Company]] (LLC)
* [[Partnership]]
* Private Share [[Holding company|Holding Company]]
* [[Share (finance)|Public Share]] Holding Company
* Branches
* Representative Offices
Under UAE Law, there are five types of business establishments applicable to foreign entities interested in establishing a formal presence in the UAE. UAE government has implemented wide range of economic and administrative policies which has made UAE an attractive business destination.

A company can create a permanent establishment, create an entity in a UAE free zone, enter into a commercial agency agreement, establish a branch office, create a civil company (currently possible to establish a company in Dubai,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldwideformations.com/free-zone-incorporation/dubai|title=Business Setup in Dubai FreeZone {{!}} Dubai Freezone Company Formation {{!}} WWFL|work=WWFL|access-date=2018-02-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharjah &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldwideformations.com/free-zone-incorporation/sharjah|title=Sharjah Freezone Incorporation {{!}}Company Registration Sharjah {{!}}WWFL|work=WWFL|access-date=2018-02-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ajman&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldwideformations.com/free-zone-incorporation/ajman|title=Ajman Freezone {{!}}Company Formation &amp; Registration in Ajma FreeZone {{!}}WWFL|work=WWFL|access-date=2018-02-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Limited Liability Company ===

A [[Limited Liability Company]] (LLC) is the most common type of registration in the UAE and is recommended where the purpose of the entity is to make sales within the region. However, it should be noted that 100% foreign ownership of such an entity is not permitted. Under the UAE Commercial Companies Law (CCL), foreign investors are permitted to hold up to 49 per cent equity ownership in UAE companies and 51 per cent of the equity must be held at all times by one or more UAE nationals.

In accordance with Article (218) of the CCL a Limited Liability Company can be formed by a minimum of 1 (as per Article 8 of the Federal Commercial Company Law of 2015) and a maximum of 50 [[shareholders]] whose liability is limited to their shares in the capital of the company. Recent amendments to Article (217) of the CCL that came into force in June 2009 removed the requirement for minimum [[share capital]] (previously AED 300,000 in Dubai and AED 150,000 in other Emirates) allowing founders of a limited liability company the freedom to determine the company’s share capital which could be less than the earlier prescribed bottom line.

A LLC must appoint a minimum of one manager and up to a maximum of five managers for the business. Managers must be appointed by a [[Memorandum of Association]] or by a management contract, for a fixed term or an unlimited term. Unless the Memorandum of Association states otherwise, the manager has full powers of administration and management of the LLC. LLC is not allowed to practice its activities in the UAE without a Trade License and Commercial Registration Certificate.

=== Free Zone Company ===

Establishing a business entity in one of the UAE's many [[Free trade zone]]s (FTZs) can be an attractive option for foreign investors. UAE has over 35 FTAs of which more than 20 are located in Dubai. 
The main attraction for setting up a company in a free zone is that there is no UAE national shareholding required. All free zones in UAE offer the following incentives:
* 100% foreign ownership of the enterprises
* 100% cent import and export tax exemptions
* 100% repatriation of capital and profits
* No currency restrictions
* [[Corporate tax]] exemption for 15 years, renewable for an additional 15 years
* No personal [[income taxes]]

UAE Free Zone companies can only operate within the free zone boundaries and are generally limited to performing solely those activities listed in their license(s).

It is mandatory for every company registered in the Free Zone to lease minimum office space within that particular Free Zone. A Free Zone Company can obtain UAE residence visas for the director, shareholder and also employees of the company through the Free Zone where it is registered.

=== Offshore Company ===

UAE [[Offshore company]] registration is a very popular method of doing business in the Middle East region. 
In UAE there are three offshore jurisdictions – Dubai (Jebel Ali Offshore Company)  [[Ras Al Khaimah]]and Ajman. They offer similar services but serve different strategic goals of offshore company registration.The Jebel Ali Offshore Company is an International Business Crown/holds the only offshore vehicle that is permitted to own / hold real estate in the Emirate of Dubai.

The RAK Offshore and the RAK International Company (RAKIC) are International Business Companies. They provide a flexible and credible option for foreign investors to register an offshore company in UAE without the need to establish a physical presence in the UAE.

UAE Offshore companies offer the following benefits:
* No Corporate tax
* 100% foreign ownership
* Limited Liability Company
* No TIEAs
* Absolute Privacy and Confidentiality
* Ability to maintain multi-currency Bank accounts in the UAE
* Virtual office facilities available in the UAE

=== Branch / Representative Office ===

A branch office has the same legal identity as its [[parent company]] and conducts business under the name of its parent company. A branch office may only be engaged in activities similar to those of its parent company but it is not permitted to carry on the business of importing the products of its parent company, a function reserved for local trade agents. In some cases the Branch of a foreign company are required to obtain an additional license from UAE Ministry of Economy.

[[Representative office]], on the other hand, is limited to promoting its parent company’s activities i.e. gathering information and soliciting orders and projects to be performed by the company’s head office.

A UAE national must be appointed as a ‘service agent’ for the branch or representative office.

=== Civil Company ===

A civil company is a business partnership for professionals like doctors, lawyers, engineers and accountants.
A civil company is 100% owned by the professional partners (except for engineering civil company), however, a UAE National Local Service Agent is normally required.  
A foreign company can be a partner in a civil company, as long as the foreign company is in the same field as the civil company.

The '''Youth International Party''', whose members were commonly called '''Yippies''', was an American radically youth-oriented and [[counterculture|countercultural]] [[revolutionary]] offshoot of the [[Free Speech Movement|free speech]] and anti-war movements of the 1960s. It was founded on December 31, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krassner, Confessions of a raving, unconfined nut: misadventures in the counter-culture, Page 156, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil A. Hamilton, The ABC-CLIO companion to the 1960s counterculture in America, Page 339, ABC-CLIO, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; They employed theatrical gestures, such as advancing a pig ("[[Pigasus (politics)|Pigasus]] the Immortal") as a candidate for President in 1968, to mock the social status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419101355/|publisher=St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture|title=Yippies|author=David Holloway|date=2002|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709141214/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419101355/|archivedate=July 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been described as a highly theatrical, [[anti-authoritarian]] and anarchist youth movement of "symbolic politics".&lt;ref name="Abbie Hoffman page 128"&gt;Abbie Hoffman, Soon to be a Major Motion Picture, page 128.

Since they were well known for street theater and politically themed pranks, they were either ignored or denounced by many of the "old school" [[political left]]. According to [[ABC News]], "The group was known for street theater pranks and was once referred to as the '[[Groucho Marx|Groucho]] [[Marxism|Marxists]]'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/popup?id=3321269&amp;contentIndex=1&amp;page=9&amp;start=false|title=1969: Height of the Hippies|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The Yippies had no formal membership or hierarchy. [[Abbie Hoffman|Abbie]] and [[Anita Hoffman]], [[Jerry Rubin]], [[Nancy Kurshan]], and [[Paul Krassner]] founded the Yippies (according to his own account, Krassner coined the name) at a meeting in the Hoffmans' New York apartment  on December 31, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Jerry, DO IT! Scenarios of the Revolution, page 81, Simon and Schuster,  1970.&lt;/ref&gt; "If the press had created '[[hippie]],' could not we five hatch the 'yippie'?" Abbie Hoffman wrote.&lt;ref name="Abbie Hoffman page 128"/&gt;

Other activists associated with the Yippies include [[Stew Albert]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/01/nyregion/stew-albert-66-who-used-laughter-to-protest-a-war-dies.html|title=Stew Albert, 66, Who Used Laughter to Protest a War, Dies|website=New York Times|first=Douglas |last=Martin|access-date=2006-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ed Rosenthal]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Judy Gumbo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yippiegirl.com/memoir.html|title=Yippie Girl: The Joy of Protest|website=YippieGirl.com|first=Judy |last=Gumbo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quirkyberkeley.com/judy-gumbo-yippie-girl-still/|title=Judy Gumbo – Yippie Girl – Still|author=Dalzell, Tom|access-date=23 September 2017|website=Quirky Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Ed Sanders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_MJngb8LT0C&amp;pg=PT524&amp;dq=yippie+concerts&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKy-uw0oLXAhXBOSYKHXi6CIU4ChDoAQgnMAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Fug You: An Informal History of the Peace Eye Bookstore, the Fuck You Press, the Fugs and Counterculture in the Lower East Side|author=Ed Sanders|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robin Morgan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iU97L2XVGN4C&amp;pg=PT78&amp;lpg=PT78&amp;dq=yippies+feminists&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SALhT6tKw6&amp;sig=Vdbn-dYo7yu8t_ngd_lOGcAA3KM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijpOvPkYzYAhXDqYMKHWO_CAMQ6AE|title=Mass Media and the Shaping of American Feminism, 1963-1975|author=Patricia Bradley|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phil Ochs]], [[Robert M.

A Yippie flag was frequently seen at anti-war demonstrations. The flag had a [[Anarchist symbolism#Black flag|black background]] with a five-pointed [[red star]] in the center, and a green [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] leaf superimposed over it. When asked about the Yippie flag, an anonymous Yippie identified only as "Jung" told ''The New York Times'' that "The black is for anarchy.  The red star is for our [[Socialist heraldry|five point program]].  And the leaf is for marijuana, which is for getting ecologically stoned without polluting the environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=znjlwbfZOTcC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=yippie+flag+five+point&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_bwqn0E1zE&amp;sig=zPprWanO0rqy9gz7N7L0reaFgo8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwA2oVChMI-avaw5KEyAIViEuSCh2PIQSX#v=onepage&amp;q=yippie%20flag%20five%20point&amp;f=false|title=Collision at Home Plate: The Lives of Pete Rose and Bart Giamatti|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|authorlink=James Reston Jr|first=James |last=Reston Jr|date=1 February 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This flag is also mentioned in Hoffman's ''[[Steal This Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Abbie Hoffman, Steal This Book, page 73. Grove Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin became the most famous Yippies—and bestselling authors—in part due to publicity surrounding the five-month [[Chicago Seven]] Conspiracy trial of 1969. They both used the phrase "ideology is a brain disease" to separate the Yippies from mainstream political parties that played the game by the rules. Hoffman and Rubin were arguably the most colorful of the seven defendants accused of [[criminal conspiracy]] and [[Incitement|inciting]] to [[riot]] at the August [[1968 Democratic National Convention]]. Hoffman and Rubin used the trial as a platform for Yippie antics—at one point, they showed up in court attired in judicial robes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://famous-trials.com/chicago8/1321-contempt|title=The Chicago Eight Trial: Selected Contempt Specifications|website=Famous Trials}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
[[File:Yippie poster.jpg|thumb|270px|YIP poster advertising the 1968 [[Festival of Life]].]]
The term ''Yippie'' was invented by Krassner and Hoffman on New Year's Eve 1967. [[Paul Krassner]] wrote in a January 2007 article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'':

{{quote|We needed a name to signify the radicalization of hippies, and I came up with Yippie as a label for a phenomenon that already existed, an organic coalition of [[psychedelia|psychedelic]] hippies and political activists. In the process of cross-fertilization at antiwar demonstrations, we had come to share an awareness that there was a linear connection between putting kids in prison for smoking pot in this country and burning them to death with [[napalm]] on the other side of the planet.&lt;ref name=latimes2007jan28&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/28/entertainment/ca-yippies28 "'60s live again, minus the LSD"]. By [[Paul Krassner]]. January 28, 2007. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anita Hoffman liked the word, but felt that ''[[The New York Times]]'' and other "strait-laced types" needed a more formal name to take the movement seriously. That same night she came up with Youth International Party, because it symbolized the movement and made for a good play on words.&lt;ref&gt;David T. Dellinger, Judy Clavir and John Spitzer, The Conspiracy Trial, page 349. Bobbs-Merrill, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the name Youth International Party, the organization was also simply called Yippie!, as in a shout for joy (with an exclamation mark to express exhilaration).&lt;ref&gt;Jonah Raskin, For the Hell of It, page 129. University of California Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; "What does Yippie! mean?" Abbie Hoffman wrote. "Energy – fun – fierceness – exclamation point!"&lt;ref&gt;Abbie Hoffman, Revolution For the Hell of It, page 81. Dial Press, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First press conference===
The Yippies held their first press conference in New York at the Americana Hotel March 17, 1968, five months before the August [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in Chicago. [[Judy Collins]] sang at the press conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famous-trials.com/chicago8/1320-collins|title=The Chicago Eight Trial : Testimony of Judy Collins|website=Famous Trials}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Krassner]], ''Confessions of a Raving Unconfined Nut'', p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript348_full.html|title=NOW with Bill Moyers (transcript dated 11-26-04)|website=PBS|access-date=2004-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' reported it with an article titled: "Yipes! The Yippies Are Coming!"&lt;ref name=latimes2007jan28/&gt;

==The New Nation concept==
{{American socialism |Former parties}}

The Yippie "New Nation" concept called for the creation of alternative, counterculture institutions: [[food co-op]]s; [[underground press|underground newspapers]] and [[zines]]; [[free clinic]]s and [[support groups]]; [[artist collective]]s; [[potlatch]]es, [[Flea Market|"swap-meets"]] and [[Give-away shop|free stores]]; [[organic farming]]/[[permaculture]]; [[pirate radio]], [[bootleg recording]] and [[public-access television]]; [[Squatting]]; [[Free school movement|free schools]]; etc.  Yippies believed these cooperative institutions and a radicalized hippie culture would spread until they supplanted the existing system.  Many of these ideas/practices came from other (overlapping and intermingling) counter-cultural groups such as the [[Diggers (theater)|Diggers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XUikrTLOJPQC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=yippies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit6IWPr_HWAhWH1CYKHS31APY4ChDoAQgnMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=yippies&amp;f=false|title=Anti-Disciplinary Protest: Sixties Radicalism and Postmodernism|author=Julie Stephens|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diggers.org/history.htm|title=A People's Hxstory of the Sixties|website=The Digger Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]], the [[Merry Pranksters]]/[[Deadhead]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Rosie McGee, "Total Environmental Theatre" in ''Grateful Dead Family Album'', p. 38-40, Time-Warner Books 1990, ed.

There was much overlap, social interaction and cross-pollination within these groups and the Yippies, so there was much crossover membership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/11/archives/jerry-rubins-change-of-cause-from-antiwar-to-me-movement-just-mimi.html|title=Jerry Rubin's Change of Cause: From Antiwar to 'Me'|publisher=New York Times|author=Klemesrud, Judy|date=11 November 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as similar influences and intentions.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Wolfe, ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]'', Farrar Straus Giroux, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Stone, ''[[Prime Green: Remembering the Sixties]]'', HarperCollins Publishers, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

"We are a people. We are a new nation," YIP's New Nation Statement said of the burgeoning [[hippie]] movement. "We want everyone to control their own life and to care for one another ... We cannot tolerate attitudes, institutions, and machines whose purpose is the destruction of life, the accumulation of profit."&lt;ref&gt;The New Yippie Book Collective (eds.), Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago to 1984, page 514. Bleecker Publishing, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal was a decentralized, collective, [[anarchism|anarchistic]] nation rooted in the borderless hippie counterculture and its communal ethos. Abbie Hoffman wrote: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;We shall not defeat Amerika by organizing a political party. We shall do it by building a new nation – a nation as rugged as the marijuana leaf.&lt;ref&gt;Abbie Hoffman, Woodstock Nation, back cover. Vintage Books, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Anthony Moretta, ''The Hippies: A 1960s History'', p. 260. [[McFarland &amp; Company]], Jefferson, NC. 2017. {{ISBN|978-0786499496}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The flag for the "new nation" consisted of a black background with a red five pointed star in the center and a green marijuana leaf superimposed over it (same as the YIP flag).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fotw.net/flags/us%7Dyip.html Flags of the World – Youth International Party listing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210053745/http://www.fotw.net/flags/us%7Dyip.html |date=February 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicago Museum shows a different flag for the new nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.chicagohistory.org/index.php/2011/06/yippies-in-lincoln-park-1968/|title=Chicago History Museum - Blog  » Blog Archive   » Yippies in Lincoln Park, 1968|publisher=|accessdate=February 4, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073042/http://blog.chicagohistory.org/index.php/2011/06/yippies-in-lincoln-park-1968/|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not the marijuana leaf. It has the word NOW under what looks like the all-seeing eye on a pyramid seen on the back of a dollar bill.

==Culture and activism==
{{See also|Counterculture of the 1960s}}

The Yippies often paid tribute to [[rock 'n' roll]] and irreverent pop-culture figures such as the [[Marx Brothers]], [[James Dean]] and [[Lenny Bruce]]. Many Yippies used nicknames which contained [[Baby Boomer]] television or pop references, such as [[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]] or [[Gumby]]. (Pogo was notable for creating the famous slogan: "[[Pogo_(comic_strip)#.22We_have_met_the_enemy_and_he_is_us..22|We
 have met the enemy and he is us]]"—first used on a 1970 [[Earth Day]] poster.)

The Yippies' love of pop-culture was one way to differentiate the Old and New Left, as [[Jesse Walker]] writes in [[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] magazine:

{{quote|Forty years ago, the yippies seemed unusual because they fused the political radicalism of the New Left with the long-haired, grass-smoking lifestyle of the counterculture. Today that combination is so familiar that many people don't even realize that the protesters and the hippies initially distrusted each other. What seems most curious about the yippies ''today'' is the way they mixed hard left politics with a deep appreciation for pop culture. Abbie Hoffman announced that he wanted to combine the styles of [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Fidel Castro]]. Jerry Rubin dedicated ''Do it!'' not just to his girlfriend but to "Dope, Color TV, and Violent Revolution." Even when praising a form of mass culture that had earned some grudging respect from the late-'60s left—rock 'n' roll—Rubin's list of musicians who "gave us the life/beat and set us free" included not just raucous originals like [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Bo Diddley]] but [[Fabian Forte|Fabian]] and [[Frankie Avalon]], commercial confections that most lefty rock intellectuals disdained as insufficiently authentic. In one chapter, Rubin complained that if "the white ideological left" took over, "Rock dancing would be taboo, and miniskirts, Hollywood movies and comic books would be illegal." All this from a self-proclaimed communist whose heroes included Castro, [[Chairman Mao]], and [[Ho Chi Minh]].

It's not that the yippies swallowed pop culture uncritically. (Hoffman kept a sign attached to the bottom of his TV that said "bullshit.") It's that they saw the mass media's dream-world as another terrain to fight in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2008/08/27/the-yippie-show|title=The Yippie Show|author=Walker, Jesse|website=REASON|access-date=27 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At demonstrations and parades, Yippies often wore [[face paint]] or colorful [[bandanna]]s to keep from being identified in photographs. Other Yippies reveled in the spotlight, allowing their stealthier comrades the anonymity they needed for their pranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/chicago10/yippies.html |title=CHICAGO 10: The Film: The Players: The Yippies |publisher=PBS|date=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA38-IA2&amp;dq=yippies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiywOXPs_HWAhUBxmMKHSFMALc4FBDoAQg-MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=yippies&amp;f=false|title=The Loony Humor of the Yippies|author=[[Shana Alexander]]|publisher=LIFE magazine|date=25 October 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aim_-KChqLgC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=yippies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi985mv24LXAhUF5CYKHXVhD904FBDoAQhKMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=yippies&amp;f=false|title=Play, Creativity, and Social Movements: If I Can't Dance, It's Not My Revolution|author=Benjamin Shepard|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One cultural intervention that misfired was at [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]], with [[Abbie Hoffman]] interrupting a performance by [[The Who]], trying to speak against the incarceration of [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]], sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1969 after giving two joints to an undercover narcotics officer. Guitarist [[Pete Townshend]] used his guitar to bat Hoffman off the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_xR__PLTyY|title=the who - woodstock incident with abbie hoffman and pete|date=June 13, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=February 4, 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yippies were the first on the [[New Left]] to make a point of exploiting mass media.&lt;ref&gt;Abbie Hoffman, Soon to be a Major Motion Picture, p. 86. Perigee Books, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Colorful, theatrical Yippie actions were tailored to attract media coverage and also to provide a stage where people could express the "repressed" Yippie inside them.&lt;ref name="doit86"&gt;Jerry Rubin, ''Do It!'', page 86. Simon and Schuster, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; "We believe every nonyippie is a repressed yippie," Jerry Rubin wrote in ''Do it!'' "We try to bring out the yippie in everybody."&lt;ref name="doit86"/&gt;

===Early Yippie actions===
[[File:Yippie! Button at the Chicago History Museum.jpg|thumb|right|200px|a Yippie! button on display at the [[Chicago History Museum]]]]
Yippies were famous for their sense of humor.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Boskin, Rebellious Laughter: People's humor in America, page 98. Syracuse University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[direct action]]s were often satirical and elaborate [[practical joke|prank]]s or put-ons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yui4BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=yippies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi74KnE_r3cAhVFba0KHUArA6s4KBDoAQhUMAg#v=snippet&amp;q=yippies%20&amp;f=false|title=Radical Theatrics: Put-Ons, Politics, and the Sixties|publisher=[[University of Washington Press]]|author=Craig J.

Another famous prank just before Yippie was coined was a [[guerrilla theater]] event in New York City on August 24, 1967.  [[Abbie Hoffman]] and a group of future Yippies managed to get into a tour of the [[New York Stock Exchange]], where they threw fistfuls of real and fake US$ from the balcony of the visitors' gallery down to the [[trader (finance)|trader]]s below, some of whom booed, while others began to scramble frantically to grab the money as fast as they could.
&lt;ref&gt;Soon To Be A Major Motion Picture: The Autobiography of Abbie Hoffman, First Edition, Perigree Books, 1980, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The visitors' gallery was closed until a glass barrier could be installed, to prevent similar incidents.

On the 40th anniversary of the NYSE event, [[CNN]]-Money editor James Ledbetter described the now-famous incident:

{{quote|[The] group of pranksters began throwing handfuls of one-dollar bills over the railing, laughing the entire time. (The exact number of bills is a matter of dispute; Hoffman later wrote that it was 300, while others said no more than 30 or 40 were thrown.)

Some of the brokers, clerks and stock runners below laughed and waved; others jeered angrily and shook their fists. The bills barely had time to land on the ground before guards began removing the group from the building, but news photos had been taken and the Stock Exchange "happening" quickly slid into iconic status.

Once outside, the activists formed a circle, holding hands and chanting "Free! Free!" At one point, Hoffman stood in the center of the circle and lit the edge of a $5 bill while grinning madly, but an NYSE runner grabbed it from him, stamped on it, and said: "You're disgusting."

If the prank accomplished nothing else, it helped cement Hoffman's reputation as one of America's most outlandish and creative protestors ... the "Yippie" movement quickly became a prominent part of America's counterculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/07/17/news/funny/abbie_hoffman/|title=The day the NYSE went Yippie|website=CNN Money|author=Ledbetter, James|access-date=23 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There was a clash with police on March 22, 1968, where a large group of countercultural youths led by the Yippies descended into [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]] for a "Yip-In".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/17999/|title=Radical Street Theatre and the Yippie Legacy: a Performance History of the Youth International Party, 1967-1968|author=Susanne E. Shawyer|website=University of Texas, Austin|date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The night erupted into a violent clash with police that Don McNeill of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' christened a "pointless confrontation in a [[box canyon]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gitlin|first=Todd|title=The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage|location=New York|year=1993|pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2010/04/21/nat-hentoff-on-the-police-riot-against-yippies-at-grand-central/|author=Hentoff, Nat|website=The Village Voice|title=Nat Hentoff on the Police Riot Against Yippies at Grand Central (4 April 1968)|access-date=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month after the Grand Central Station Yip-In, Yippies organized a "Yip-Out," a be-in style event in Central Park that went off peacefully and drew 20,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Hamilton, The ABC-CLIO companion to the 1960s counterculture in America, Page 340, ABC-CLIO, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''A Trumpet to Arms: Alternative Media in America'', author David Armstrong points out that the Yippie hybrid of [[performance art]],  [[Guerilla theatre]] and political irreverence was often in direct conflict with the sensibility of the 60s American Left/peace movement: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Yippies' unorthodox approach to revolution, which emphasized spontaneity over structure, and media blitz over community organizing, put them almost as much at odds with the rest of the left as with mainstream culture. Wrote (Jerry) Rubin in the ''[[Berkeley Barb]]'', "The worst thing you can say about a demonstration is that it is boring, and one of the reasons that the peace movement has not grown into a mass movement is that the peace movement--its literature and its events--is a bore.  Good theatre is needed to communicate revolutionary content.&lt;ref&gt;David Armstrong, ''A Trumpet to Arms: Alternative Media in America'', p. 120-121, [[South End Press]], Boston. 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===House Un-American Activities Committee===
The [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) subpoenaed [[Jerry Rubin]] and [[Abbie Hoffman]] of the Yippies in 1967, and again in the aftermath of the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]]. The Yippies used media attention to make a mockery of the proceedings: Rubin came to one session dressed as an [[American Revolutionary War]] soldier, and passed out copies of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] to people in attendance. Then Rubin "blew giant gum bubbles while his co-witnesses taunted the committee with [[Nazi]] salutes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/Youth_International_Party Youth International Party], 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Rubin also attended HUAC dressed as [[Santa Claus]] and a [[Viet Cong]] soldier.

On another occasion, police stopped Hoffman at the building entrance and arrested him for wearing an [[American flag]]. Hoffman quipped for the press, "I regret that I have but one shirt to give for my country", paraphrasing the last words of revolutionary patriot [[Nathan Hale]]; meanwhile Rubin, who was wearing a matching [[Viet Cong]] flag, shouted that the police were Communists for not arresting him also.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Rubin, ''[http://faculty.atu.edu/cbrucker/Amst2003/Texts/Yippie.pdf A Yippie Manifesto]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the fifties, the most effective sanction was terror. Almost any publicity from HUAC meant the '[[Hollywood blacklist|blacklist]].' Without a chance to clear his name, a witness would suddenly find himself without friends and without a job. But it is not easy to see how in 1969 a HUAC blacklist could terrorize an [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|SDS]] activist. Witnesses like Jerry Rubin have openly boasted of their contempt for American institutions. A [[subpoena]] from HUAC would be unlikely to scandalize Abbie Hoffman or his friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1969/2/24/by-any-other-name-pthe-house|title=By Any Other Name.

Yippie theatrics culminated at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in Chicago. YIP planned a six-day Festival of Life – a celebration of the [[counterculture]] and a protest against the state of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QUAeoaEbzPkC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=yippies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiordfytfHWAhVK42MKHWNPCwY4HhDoAQhHMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=yippies&amp;f=false|title=1968: Art and Politics in Chicago|publisher=DePaul University Art Museum|editor=Patricia Kelly|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was supposed to counter the "Convention of Death." This promised to be "the blending of pot and politics into a political grass leaves movement – a cross-fertilization of the hippie and [[New Left]] philosophies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grin.com/en/e-book/324245/democracy-in-america-yippie-guerilla-theater-and-the-reinvigoration-of|title=Democracy in America, Yippie! Guerilla Theater and the Reinvigoration of the American Democratic Process During the Cold War|publisher=Syracuse University|author=Kayla Schultz|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yippies' sensational statements before the convention were part of the theatrics, including a [[tongue-in-cheek]] threat to put [[LSD]] in Chicago's water supply. "We will fuck on the beaches! ... We demand the Politics of Ecstasy! ... Abandon the Creeping Meatball! ... And all the time 'Yippie! Chicago – August 25–30.'" First on a list of Yippie demands: "An immediate end to the war in Vietnam."&lt;ref&gt;Norman Mailer, ''[[Miami and the Siege of Chicago]],'' page 137. Signet Books, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zunes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/the-us-anti-vietnam-war-movement-1964-1973/|website=International Center on Nonviolent Conflict (ICNC)|title=The US Anti-Vietnam War Movement (1964-1973)|author=Stephen Zunes, Jesse Laird|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yippie organizers hoped that well-known musicians would participate in the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|Festival of Life]] and draw a crowd of tens if not hundreds of thousands from across the country. The city of Chicago refused to issue any permits for the festival and most musicians withdrew from the project. Of the rock bands who had agreed to perform, only the [[MC5]] came to Chicago to play and their set was cut short by a clash between the audience of a couple thousand and police. [[Phil Ochs]] and several other singer-songwriters also performed during the festival.&lt;ref&gt;David Farber, Chicago '68, page 177-8, University of Chicago Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the Festival of Life and other [[anti-war]] demonstrations during the [[1968 Democratic National Convention|Democratic convention]], Chicago police repeatedly clashed with protesters, as many millions of viewers watched the extensive TV coverage of the events. On the evening of August 28 the police attacked the protesters in front of the Conrad Hilton hotel as the demonstrators chant "[[The whole world is watching]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=James|title=Democracy is in the Streets: From Port Huron to the Siege of Chicago|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|year=1987|pages=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a "police riot," concluded the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence,&lt;ref&gt;The Walker Report, ''Rights in Conflict: The violent confrontation between demonstrators and police in the parks and streets of Chicago during the week of the Democratic National Convention'', p. 5, Bantam Books, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; saying "On the part of the police there was enough wild club swinging, enough cries of hatred, enough gratuitous beating to make the conclusion inescapable that individual policemen, and lots of them, committed violent acts far in excess of the requisite force for crowd dispersal or arrest."

===The conspiracy trial===

{{See also|Chicago Seven}}

Following the convention, eight protesters were charged with conspiracy to incite the riots, and there was a heavily publicized, five-month trial. The [[Chicago Seven]] represented a cross-section of the New Left, including [[Abbie Hoffman]] and [[Jerry Rubin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/the-mess-we-made|title=The Mess We Made: An Oral History of the '68 Convention|website=GQ.com|author=Goldstein, Sarah|access-date=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''American Fun: Four Centuries of Joyous Revolt'', John Beckman writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Never mind ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', the so-called Chicago Eight (then Seven) trial was the countercultural performance of the sixties. [[Guerrilla theater]] stared down courtroom farce to decide the civil dispute of the era: the Movement vs. the Establishment.  The eight defendants seemed finically chosen to represent the world of dissent: [[Students for a Democratic Society|SDS]] leaders [[Rennie Davis]] and [[Tom Hayden]] (who had authored "The [[Port Huron Statement]]"); graduate students [[Lee Weiner]] and [[John Froines]]; portly fifty-four-year-old Christian socialist [[David Dellinger]]; Yippies Rubin and Hoffman; and--briefly--[[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[Bobby Seale]]. "Conspire, hell," Hoffman quipped. "We couldn't agree on lunch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ahdAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT290&amp;dq=john+beckman+froines+yippies&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp69GhkazbAhWdnoMKHR0FDmoQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20beckman%20froines%20yippies&amp;f=false|title=American Fun: Four Centuries of Joyous Revolt|author=John Beckman|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]], New York|date=2014|ISBN=978-0-307-90818-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several other Yippies – including [[Stew Albert]], Wolfe Lowenthal, Brad Fox and Robin Palmer – were among another 18 activists named as "unindicted co-conspirators" in the case.&lt;ref&gt;David T. Dellinger, Judy Clavir and John Spitzer, The Conspiracy Trial, page 601. Bobbs-Merrill, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; While five of the defendants were initially convicted of crossing state lines to incite a riot, all convictions were soon reversed in appeal court. Defendants Hoffman and Rubin became popular authors and public speakers, spreading Yippie militancy and comedy wherever they appeared. When Hoffman appeared on ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', for example, he wore a shirt with an American flag design, prompting [[CBS]] to black out his image when the show aired.&lt;ref&gt;Abbie Hoffman, Soon to be a Major Motion Picture, page 170. Perigee Books, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Yippie movement==
The Youth International Party quickly spread beyond Rubin, Hoffman and the other founders. YIP had chapters all over the US and in other countries, with particularly active groups in New York City, [[Vancouver]], [[Washington, D.C.]], Detroit, [[Milwaukee]], Los Angeles, [[Tucson]], [[Houston]], [[Austin]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Dayton]], Chicago, [[Berkeley California|Berkeley]], [[San Francisco]] and [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]].&lt;ref&gt;Ken Wachsberger, ''The Ballad of Ken and Emily, or, Tales from the Counterculture'', Page 54, Azenphony Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; There were YIP conferences through the 1970s, beginning with a "New Nation Conference" in Madison, Wisconsin in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;The New Yippie Book Collective, ''Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago to 1984'', Page 16. Bleecker Publishing, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Street protests===
On the final day of the Madison conference, April 4, 1971, hundreds of riot police broke up a block party organized by local Yippies to cap the event, resulting in a street clash between Yippies and police.&lt;ref&gt;"Yippies Pelt Police with Eggs, Rocks." April 5, 1971, ''The Rock Hill Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt; During an anti-war protest in Washington, D.C., on November 15, 1969, East Coast Yippies led thousands of youths in the storming of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] building.&lt;ref&gt;Kifner, John. "Tear Gas Repels Radicals' Attack." ''New York Times'', 16 November 1969&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 6, 1970, L.A. Yippies invaded [[Disneyland]], hoisting the New Nation flag at City Hall and taking over [[Tom Sawyer's Island]]. While riot police confronted the Yippies, the theme park was closed early for only the second time in the park's history (the first being shortly after the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of President Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago to 1984|editor=The New Yippie Book Collective|publisher=Bleecker Publishing|year=1983|pages=459}}&lt;/ref&gt;). As many as 23 of the 200 Yippies attending were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nightflight.com/august-6-1970-the-day-the-yippies-invaded-disneyland/|title=August 6, 1970, the Day the Yippies invaded Disneyland|website=NightFlight|author=Thomas, Bryan|access-date=2015-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vancouver Yippies invaded the U.S. border town of [[Blaine, Washington]], on May 9, 1970, to protest [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[Cambodian Campaign|invasion of Cambodia]] and [[Kent State shooting|the shooting of students]] at [[Kent State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago to 1984|editor=The New Yippie Book Collective|publisher=Bleecker Publishing|year=1983|pages=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus Yippies were charged with inciting the rioting that occurred in the city on May 11, 1972, in response to Nixon's mining of North Vietnam's Haiphong harbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago to 1984|editor=The New Yippie Book Collective|publisher=Bleecker Publishing|year=1983|pages=403}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were acquitted.

YIP was a member of the coalition of anti-Vietnam War activists&lt;ref name=Zunes /&gt; who, over several days in early May 1971, tried to shut down the U.S. government by occupying intersections and bridges in Washington, D.C. The [[1971 May Day Protests|May Day protests]] resulted in the largest [[mass arrest]] in American history.&lt;ref&gt;Lester Friedman, American cinema of the 1970s: themes and variations, Page 49, NJ Rutgers University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1971/06/17/a-special-supplement-mayday-the-case-for-civil-dis/|title=Mayday: The Case for Civil Disobedience|author=Chomsky, Noam|publisher=[[The New York Review of Books]]|date=17 June 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A frequent 'national' complaint among Yippies was that the New York 'central HQ' chapter acted as if other chapters did not exist and kept them out of the decision-making process.  At one point, at a YIP conference in Ohio in 1972, Yippies voted to 'exclude' Abbie and Jerry as official spokespersons from the party, since they had become too famous and rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/28/archives/yippies-exclude-hoffman-and-rubin-as-spokesmen.html|title=Yippies Exclude Hoffman And Rubin as Spokesmen|website=New York Times|date=28 November 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Yippies marched on the Manhattan home of [[Watergate]] conspirator [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... five hundred die-hard Yippies staged one last march on the Mitchell home, no longer the Watergate but a grand apartment building on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue.  "Free [[Martha Mitchell]]!" they chanted. "Fuck John!" When the Mitchells finally appeared at the window to see what all the commotion was about, the stoners cherished their last "eye-to-eyeball confrontation with Mr. Law 'n' Order." To commemorate the moment, they placed a giant marijuana joint on the Mitchells' doorstep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHIGQTGemnAC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=steve+conliff+yippies&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Rx-qLBpdiM&amp;sig=eZB6Dk5Kj4OWr_2jFSZnAVYbrzI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1ovjy8-7WAhUG6CYKHeXdAOs4ChDoAQgvMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=steve%20conliff%20yippies&amp;f=false|title=The Strong Man: John Mitchell and the Secrets of Watergate|author=[[James Rosen (journalist)|James Rosen]]|publisher=Doubleday|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yippies organized [[marijuana]] "smoke-ins" across North America through the 1970s and into the 1980s. The first YIP smoke-in was attended by 25,000 in Washington, D.C. on July 4, 1970.&lt;ref name=IT /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago to 1984|editor=The New Yippie Book Collective|publisher=Bleecker Publishing|year=1983|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a culture clash when many of the hippie protesters strolled en masse into the nearby "Honor America Day" festivities with Billy Graham and Bob Hope.&lt;ref name="A.

===Alternative culture===

Yippies organized alternative institutions in their counterculture communities. In [[Tucson]], Yippies operated a free store;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tucsonweekly.com/tw/04-27-95/curr1.htm|title=I Remember Jerry|author=Miller, Tom |publisher=Tucson Weekly|date=27 April 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Vancouver, Yippies established the People's Defense Fund to provide legal help for the often-harassed hippie community; in Milwaukee, Yippies helped launch the city's first [[Food cooperative|food co-op]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago to 1984|editor=The New Yippie Book Collective|publisher=Bleecker Publishing|year=1983|pages=656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Yippies were involved in the underground press.

Infamous Baltimore Yippie [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] became a renowned independent filmmaker ([[Pink Flamingos]], [[Polyester (film)|Polyester]], [[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]), once claiming in an interview that the Yippies influenced his irreverent sense of style: "I was a Yippie agitator, and I wanted to look like [[Little Richard]].

===Pranking the system===

Yippies mocked the system and its authority. The Youth International Party, having nominated a pig ([[Pigasus (politics)|Pigasus]]) for U.S. president in 1968, famously ran [[Nobody for President]] as its 'official' candidate in 1976.&lt;ref name=Conliff&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zisman.ca/openroad/1977-Spring/pages/P25.pdf |title=Everybody needs nobody sometimes|author=Conliff, Steve|publisher=Open Road|date=Spring 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spangler&gt;*[http://www.headcount.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nobody-for-President.jpg PHOTO: Nobody For President, Curtis Spangler and Wavy Gravy, October 12, 1976] (photo credit: James Stark) ''HeadCount.org''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wavy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wholeearth.com/issue/2061/article/271/20th.anniversary.rendezvous.-.wavy.gravy|author=Wavy Gravy|title=20th Anniversary Rendezvous - Wavy Gravy|publisher=Whole Earth Review|website=WholeEarth.com|date=Winter 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vancouver Yippie Betty "Zaria" Andrew ran as the Youth International Party's candidate for mayor in 1970.&lt;ref name=Zaria /&gt;  One of her campaign promises was to repeal every law, including the law of gravity so that everyone could get high.&lt;ref name=Hawthorn /&gt; That same year, Berkeley Yippie Stew Albert ran for sheriff of Alameda County, challenging the incumbent sheriff to a high-noon duel and receiving 65,000 votes.&lt;ref&gt;Stew Albert, Who the Hell is Stew Albert?,  Page 131. Red Hen Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Detroit Yippies went to city hall and applied for a permit to blow up the General Motors building.  After the permit was denied, the Yippies said that it just goes to show you can't work within the system to change the system. "This destroys my last hope for legal channels," said Detroit Yippie Jumpin' Jack Flash.&lt;ref&gt;The New Yippie Book Collective, Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago to 1984, Page 414. Bleecker Publishing, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Yippies, including [[Robin Morgan]], [[Nancy Kurshan]], Sharon Krebs and [[Judy Gumbo]], were active in the [[Guerilla theatre]] feminist group W.I.T.C.H. ([[Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell]]), which combined "theatricality, humor, and activism."&lt;ref&gt;Robin Morgan, [[Sisterhood is Powerful]], page 538.

On November 7, 1970, Jerry Rubin and London Yippies took over ''The Frost Programme'' when he was the guest on the popular British TV program. In all the chaos, a Yippie fired a water pistol into host David Frost's open mouth, the broadcaster called for a commercial break and the show was over.

===Nobody for President and "None of the Above"===

''See also:'' ''[[Nobody for President]]'' ''and'' ''[[None of the Above]]''

Perhaps one of the swan songs of [[Yippies]] was a groundbreaking effort to place a new voting option, [[None of the Above]], on the election ballot in [[Santa Barbara County]], in California, by the [[Isla Vista Municipal Advisory Council]] in 1976. This represented an incipient libertarian impulse of Yippies and the first example in the United States of this election ballot alternative, in what one of the resolution's two co-sponsors, [[Matthew Steen]], described as an "anti-institutional [[Yippie]] up-yours."  Years earlier Steen had been a Yippie activist with [[Stew Albert]], as a reporter with the ''[[Berkeley Tribe]]''.  This novel motion was adopted unanimously by the Council, having a ripple effect across the country, with voters in [[Nevada]] approving this option in a change to state election laws in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/none-of-the-above-ballot_n_3576469.html|title='None Of The Above' Ballot Option In Nevada Upheld By Federal Appeals Court|date=2015-11-25|access-date=2016-08-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125044018/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/none-of-the-above-ballot_n_3576469.html|archivedate=November 25, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in 2000 a citizen initiative to place [[None of the Above]] on the official state ballot in California was qualified although the proposition was voted down 62% to 38% in the general election that year. The most recent addition, internationally, are for state elections in [[India]] where this option must be made available in [[electronic voting machines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/326064958/Negative-Voting-in-the-Indian-Election-System-A-Study|title="Negative Voting in the Indian Election System- A Study" by Prethin V.

In 1976, national Yippies took a cue from [[Isla Vista]]ns, backing [[Nobody for President]], a campaign that took on a life of its own in the post-Watergate malaise of the mid-70s.&lt;ref name=Conliff /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wavy /&gt;&lt;ref name=Spangler /&gt;  The Yippie campaign slogan: "Nobody's perfect."&lt;ref&gt;The New Yippie Book Collective, Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago to 1984, Page 321. Bleecker Publishing, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; (Meanwhile, in a strange twist of Yippie fate, [[Matthew Steen]] had become treasurer of a student-led campaign to elect [[Jerry Brown]] for President, competing against both "Nobody for President" and [[Jimmy Carter]] during the presidential primary campaign of that year.)

From the experimental combination of Isla Vista local politics, presidential campaigns and the Yippies, the name and spirit of this unexpected ballot initiative spread quickly—in the form of [[None of the Above]] music festivals, radio and television shows, rock bands, T-shirts, buttons, (decades later) countless websites and other related social phenomena.  The die-hard dedication to the 'option' of [[Nobody for President]] and [[None of the Above]] has not abated since the counter-cultural 70s, but has only grown, unexpectedly taking the Yippie legacy into a new century and succeeding generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoaxes.org/archive/permalink/nobody_for_president/|title=Nobody For President|website=hoaxes.org|accessdate=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobodyforpresident.org/index2020.html Nobody for President 2020]&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Freetheweed.jpg|thumb|Freetheweed|Banner at Halloween Yippie Smoke-In, Columbus, Ohio, 1978]]

The most famous writing to come out of the Yippie movement is [[Abbie Hoffman]]'s ''[[Steal This Book]]'', which is considered to be a guidebook in causing general mischief and capturing the spirit of the Yippie movement. Hoffman is also the author of ''Revolution for the Hell of It'' which has been called the original Yippie book. This book claims that there were no actual yippies, and that the name was just a term used to create a myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sixties Papers: Documents of a Rebellious Decade|editor1=Judith Clavir Albert |editor2=Stewart Edward Albert |location=Connecticut|year=1984|pages=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Buy This Book]]'', written and illustrated by political cartoonist and post-'60s Yippie activist [[Pete Wagner]] (ME Publications, 1980) who distributed copies of the ''Yipster Times'' on the University of Minnesota campus in the mid-1970s, was promoted by Hoffman, who said the book "manages to reach to the limits of bad taste." ''[[Buy This Too]]'' (Wagner, Minne HA! HA!/Brain Trust, 1987) recounted efforts by the guerrilla street theater gang, the 1985 Brain Trust, a group inspired by a series of meetings and interviews between Wagner and Krassner in May 1981, when Krassner was in Minneapolis to perform standup comedy at Dudley Riggs ETC Theater, to fight the New Right with Yippie-like myth-making tactics in the Midwest during the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;''Buy This Too'', by Pete Wagner, Minne HA! HA! Publishing, Minneapolis 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, a group of Yippies published ''[[Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago, '68 to 1984]]'' (Bleecker Publishing), a large, 'phone-book sized anthology' (733 pages) of Yippie history, including journalistic accounts from both alternative and mainstream media, as well as many personal stories and essays.  Includes countless photographs, old leaflets and posters, 'underground' comics, newspaper clippings, and various other historical ephemera.  The editors (often doubling as authors) officially called themselves "The New Yippie Book Collective";  which included [[Steve Conliff]] (who wrote over half the volume), [[Dana Beal]] (head archivist), Grace Nichols, Daisy Deadhead, [[Ben Masel]], Alice Torbush, Karen Wachsman, and Aron Kay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago, '68, to 1984 | author=New Yippie Book Collective | isbn=9780912873008 |publisher=Bleecker Publishing|date=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still in print.

In 2000, a [[Hollywood]] film based on the life of Yippie co-founder [[Abbie Hoffman]], titled ''[[Steal This Movie]]'' (spoofing the title of his book, ''[[Steal This Book]]''), was released to mixed reviews, with [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|id=0161216|title=Steal This Movie}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Noted film critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the movie a positive review,&lt;ref name="RogerEbert.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/steal-this-movie-2000|author=Ebert, Roger|title=Steal This Movie|website=RogerEbert.com|publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=August 25, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; remarking that although it is often difficult to credibly bring historic events to life, he believed the movie succeeded:&lt;ref name="RogerEbert.com"/&gt;

{{Quote|text=Abbie Hoffman is seen wearing an American flag shirt and getting in trouble for desecrating it; the movie cuts to footage of [[Roy Rogers]] and [[Dale Evans]] yodeling while wearing their flag shirts. Hoffman insisted that the flag represented all Americans, including those opposed to the war; he resisted efforts of the Right to annex it as their exclusive ideological banner.

Vincent D'Onofrio has an interesting task, playing the role, since Hoffman seems on autopilot much of the time. He is charismatic and has an instinctive grasp of the dramatic gesture, but can be infuriating on a one-to-one level ...&lt;ref name=RogerEbert.com /&gt;}}

In 2004, the Yippies, along with the National AIDS Brigade, purchased the long-time Yippie "headquarters" (which had initially been acquired by [[squatting]]&lt;ref name=Starecheski /&gt;) at 9 [[Bleecker Street]] in New York City &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/01/garden/yippies-answer-to-smoke-filled-rooms.html|title=Yippies' Answer to Smoke-Filled Rooms|website=New York Times|author=Leland, John|access-date=2003-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; for $1.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/article/29241|title=Yippies Apply for a Piece of Establishment|author=Kolben, Deborah|website=New York Sun|access-date=2006-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After official purchase, it was converted into the "Yippie Museum/Café and Gift Shop",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thevillager.com/villager_144/museumwillhave.html|title=Museum will have Abbie's trash, Rubin's road kill|author=Anderson, Lincoln|website=The Villager|access-date=2006-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkartworld.com/things/things-yippie.html|title=The Yippie Museum|website=New York Art World|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; housing a multitude of counter-cultural and leftist memorabilia from all over the world, as well as providing an independently operated café that featured live music on scheduled nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thevillager.com/villager_185/stealthiscoffeehouse.html|title=Steal This Coffeehouse : Yippies Revive the 60s Vibe|website=The Villager|author=Haught, Lori|access-date=2006-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/nyregion/thecity/20yipp.html|title=At the Yippie Museum, It's Parrots and Flannel|author=Bleyer, Jennifer|website=New York Times|access-date=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performers at the café included both nationally known figures and local bands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://localeastvillage.com/2011/12/09/yippee-the-yippie-museum-cafe-gets-back-its-groove/|website=Local East Village|title=Yippee!

The museum was chartered by the [[Board of Regents]] of the [[University of the State of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regents.nysed.gov/2006Meetings/March2006/0306bra1.htm|title=NY Board of Regents – Charter Applications for March 2006|publisher=State of New York|date=September 29, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929113834/http://www.regents.nysed.gov/2006Meetings/March2006/0306bra1.htm|archivedate=September 29, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the original curator's message, the museum was founded "to preserve the history of the Youth International Party and all of its offshoots."

[[George Martinez (activist)|George Martinez]] was a semi-frequent speaker at the Yippies' Open-Mic, known as "Occupational Hazards/The People's Soapbox,"&lt;ref name=Lennard /&gt; as was [[Andy Stepanian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timknoxshoots.wordpress.com/2013/06/13/at-the-yippie-cafe/|title=At the Yippie Cafe|website=timknoxshoots|access-date=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Captain Ray Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://vimeo.com/35688245|title=Philadelphia's Capt.

In Summer 2013, The Yippie Cafe officially closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypress.com/remembering-the-yippies/|title=Remembering the Yippies : Counter-cultural haven on Bleecker Street still alive despite legal struggle|website=NY PRESS|author=Fitzsimmons, Daniel|access-date=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/loan-dispute-threatens-a-countercultural-soapbox/?_r=0|title=Loan Dispute Threatens a Countercultural Soapbox|website=New York Times|author=Moynihan, Colin|access-date=2013-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 2014, the Yippie building (Museum) at #9 Bleecker was sold, closed and permanently cleaned out;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.celebstoner.com/blogs/preston-peet/2014/01/17/requiem-for-yippie-stronghold,-9-bleecker/|title=Requiem for Yippie Stronghold, 9 Bleecker|website=CelebStoner|author=Peet, Preston|access-date=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of the memorabilia and historic materials dispersed among the remaining New York Yippies.&lt;ref name=Moynihan2014 /&gt;

As of 2017, the old Yippie building at #9 Bleecker had been totally transformed into a successful [[Bowery]]-area [[Boxing]] club called "Overthrow", deliberately and artfully retaining much of its original Yippie/60s-revolutionary decor. Tourists still drop by to see it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patterson.no-art.info/activities/2016-10-10_overthrow-fanzine.pdf|title=OVERTHROW FANZINE|author=Patterson, Clayton|publisher=Overthrow Boxing Club|access-date=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
