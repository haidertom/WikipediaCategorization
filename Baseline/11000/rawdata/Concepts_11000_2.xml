'''80,000 Hours''' is a San Francisco-based organisation that conducts research on the careers with positive social impact and provides career advice. It provides this advice online, through one-on-one advice sessions and through a community of like-minded individuals. The organisation is part of the '''Centre for Effective Altruism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, affiliated with the [[University of Oxford]] Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics.&lt;ref name="80k-history" /&gt; The organisation's name refers to the typical amount of time someone spends working over a lifetime.&lt;ref name="80k-faq"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://80000hours.org/faq | title = FAQ | accessdate = 29 October 2012 | publisher = 80,000 Hours | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121101064337/http://80000hours.org/faq | archivedate = 1 November 2012 | df = dmy-all }}; {{cite web | url = http://www.euromoney.com/Article/3044777/Impact-investing-the-big-business-of-small-donors.html | title = Impact investing: the big business of small donors | accessdate = 31 October 2012 | publisher = Euromoney }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the nonprofits funded by startup accelerator [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]] in 2015.&lt;ref name=yc-techcrunch&gt;{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/04/80000-hours/|title = Want To Make An Impact With Your Work?

== Principles ==
According to 80,000 Hours, some careers aimed at doing good are far more effective than others. On their framework for assessing different career options, the value of a career is regarded as depending on both its potential for impact and on the degree to which it gives the individual better opportunities to have an impact in the future.&lt;ref name="80k-about"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://80000hours.org/research | title = Research | accessdate = 17 January 2014 | publisher = 80,000 Hours}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group emphasises that the positive impact of choosing a certain occupation should be measured by the amount of additional good that is done as a result of this choice, not by the amount of good directly done.&lt;ref name="80k-counterfactuals"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://80000hours.org/blog/35-the-replaceability-effect-working-in-unethical-industries-part-1 | title = The replaceability effect: working in unethical industries part 1 | author = Sebastian Farquhar | accessdate = 31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It considers indirect ways of making a difference, such as [[Earning to give|earning a high salary in a conventional career and donating]] a portion of it, as well as direct ways, such as scientific research. The moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]] mentions the example of banking and finance as a potentially high impact career through such donations in his TED Talk, "The why and how of effective altruism," where he discusses the work of 80,000 Hours.&lt;ref name="peter-singer-TED-talk"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism.html | title = The why and how of effective altruism | author = Peter Singer | accessdate = 27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[William MacAskill]] is the Founder and President of 80,000 Hours,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://80000hours.org/about/meet-the-team/|title=Meet the team|work=80,000 Hours|access-date=4 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Co-founder and Vice-President of [[Giving What We Can]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/the-team|title=The Team|accessdate=16 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021170844/http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/the-team|archivedate=21 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Research Associate at the Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics, [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/staff/staff/research_associates/will_macaskill|title=William MacAskill, Research Associate|accessdate=16 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023051515/http://www.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/staff/staff/research_associates/will_macaskill|archivedate=23 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
80,000 Hours has promoted the idea that pursuing a high-earning career and donating a significant portion of the income to cost-effective charities can be an effective philanthropic strategy for some people. [[John Humphrys]] criticised this idea on the [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|BBC Today programme]], saying that people interested in becoming wealthy tend to be selfish and that idealistic young people will become cynical as they age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview | last = Crouch | first = William | last2 = Hislop | first2 = Ian | title= BBC News - Today - Do bankers make the world better? | subjectlink2 = Ian Hislop | others = [[John Humphrys]] |work=Today | date = 22 November 2011  | access-date = 29 October 2012 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9645000/9645137.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea was also criticised in the ''Oxford Left Review'', where Pete Mills wrote that lucrative careers perpetuate an unjust system.&lt;ref name="oxford-left"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mills | first = Pete | title = The Ethical Careers Debate | journal = The Oxford Left Review | issue = 7 | pages = 4–9 | date = May 2012 | url=http://oxfordleftreview.com/2012/07/17/olr-issue/ | access-date = 6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he argues that because the likelihood of bringing about social change is difficult to quantify, 80,000 Hours is biased toward quantifiable methods of doing good.

Over time 80,000 Hours has deemphasised 'earning to give', in favour of alternative paths like research, advocacy or policy reform, and begun recommending work on problems that are less easily quantified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://80000hours.org/2015/07/80000-hours-thinks-that-only-a-small-proportion-of-people-should-earn-to-give-long-term/|title=80,000 Hours thinks that only a small proportion of people should earn to give long term - 80,000 Hours|date=2015-07-06|work=80,000 Hours|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/|title=A list of the most urgent global issues|work=80,000 Hours|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' has criticised the organisation for its [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] approach to altruism and has argued that cultivating altruism is not purely a matter of maximising one's positive social impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper | last = Brooks | first = David | title = How to Produce a Person | newspaper = The New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/brooks-the-way-to-produce-a-person.html |date=4 June 2013 |page=A25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[effective altruism]] movement, of which 80,000 Hours is a part, has been criticised by Ken Berger, the founder of [[Charity Navigator]] for its efforts to objectively compare and prioritise charitable causes, which he believes to be a subjective process that is the responsibility of individual donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Elitist Philanthropy of So-Called Effective Altruism | journal = Stanford Social Innovation Review | url = http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/the_elitist_philanthropy_of_so_called_effective_altruism}}&lt;/ref&gt; William MacAskill responded to this article justifying the need to figure out which charities do the most good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/what_charity_navigator_gets_wrong_about_effective_altruism|title=What Charity Navigator Gets Wrong About Effective Altruism (SSIR)|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10060">In [[neuroscience]] and [[psychophysics]], an '''absolute threshold''' was originally defined as the lowest level of a [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] – light, sound, touch, etc. – that an organism could detect. Under the influence of [[Detection theory|signal detection theory]], absolute threshold has been redefined as the level at which a stimulus will be detected a specified percentage (often 50%) of the time.&lt;ref name="Colman2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Colman|first=Andrew M.|title=A Dictionary of Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aPk_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=11 October 2014|date=26 February 2009|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-104768-8|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absolute threshold can be influenced by several different factors, such as the subject's motivations and expectations, cognitive processes, and whether the subject is adapted to the stimulus.&lt;ref name = "Gale"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3406000012.html" Absolute Threshold." Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology. 2001.] Retrieved July 14, 2010 from Encyclopedia.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://m.livescience.com/33895-human-eye.html&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The absolute threshold can be compared to the [[difference threshold]], which is the measure of how different two stimuli must be for the subject to notice that they are not the same.&lt;ref name = "Gale" /&gt;

==Vision==
A landmark 1942 experiment by [[Selig Hecht|Hecht]], Shlaer, and Pirenne assessed the absolute threshold for vision. They tried to measure the minimum number of [[photon]]s the [[human eye]] can detect 60% of the time, using the following controls:&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamentals of Sensation and Perception'', Michael Levine. Oxford University Press (3rd Edition). London, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Visual Perception'', [[Tom N. Cornsweet|Tom Cornsweet]]. Harcourt Publishing (1970). Chapters 2 and 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hecht1942"&gt;{{Citation | last = Hecht | first = Selig | last2 = Shlaer | first2 = Simon | last3 = Pirenne | first3 = Maurice Henri | date = 1942-07-20 |title = Energy, Quanta, and Vision | journal = Journal of General Physiology | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | publisher = The Rockefeller Press | pages = 819–840 | pmc=2142545 | pmid=19873316 | doi=10.1085/jgp.25.6.819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Dark adaptation – the participants were completely dark adapted (a process lasting forty minutes) to optimise their visual sensitivity.
* Location – the stimulus was presented to an area where there is a high density of rod cells, 20 degrees to the left of the point of focus (i.e., 20 degrees to the right of the [[Fovea centralis|fovea]]).
* Stimulus size – the stimulus had a diameter of 10 [[minutes of arc]] (1 minute=1/60th of a degree). Although not explicitly mentioned in the original research paper, this ensured that the light stimulus fell only on rod cells connected to the same nerve fibre (this is called the ''area of spatial summation'').
* Wavelength – the stimulus wavelength matched the maximum sensitivity of rod cells (510&amp;nbsp;nm).
* Stimulus duration – 0.001 second (1 ms).

The researchers found that the emission of only 5-14 photons could elicit visual experience. However, only about half of these entered the retina, due to reflection (from the cornea), absorption, and other factors relating to transmittance of the ocular media. The researchers estimated that 5 to 14 of the estimated 500 rods in the test area would each absorb one photon, with a 4% chance that one rod would absorb two photons.

A second absolute threshold for vision involves the minimum photon flux (photons per second per unit area). In this case the light covers a wide field over an extended period of time instead of being concentrated on one spot on the retina in a short burst. Knowing the pupil diameter and the wavelength of the light, the result can be described in terms of [[luminance]] (~0.000001 [[candela]] per square meter or 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or retinal [[illuminance]] (~0.00002 Trolands). By including estimates for the probability of an average photon being absorbed by an average rod cell, the threshold stimulation for the rods is approximately one photon absorption per second per 5000 rods.&lt;ref name="Shevell2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shevell|first=Steven K.|title=The Science of Color|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fNJZ0xmTFIC&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=11 October 2014|date=11 July 2003|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-052322-4|pages=45–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of total absolute power sensitivity, Denton and Pirenne in the Journal of Physiology in 1954 found that for diffuse, extended sources i.e. a relatively large (~ 45 degree wide source, as viewed by the subject) frosted glass aperture, and a long (5 second) observation and decision time, the human eye could begin to reliably distinguish the lit from unlit glass at a power level of approximately 7.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−14&lt;/sup&gt; watts / steradian-cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at the eye for green (510&amp;nbsp;nm) light. This power level was dependent on the wavelength of the light used according to the usual luminosity curve. For white light, the absolute sensitivity found was 5.9 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−14&lt;/sup&gt; watts / steradian-cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This base sensitivity varied only about 0.03 log steps between monocular (one-eyed) or binocular (two eyed) vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1366217 | pmid=13152690 | volume=123 | title=The absolute sensitivity and functional stability of the human eye. | date=Mar 1954 | journal=J Physiol | pages=417–42 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1954.sp005062 | author=Denton EJ, Pirenne MH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 Sakitt conducted an experiment that combined elements of signal detection and threshold theory. Two key elements of the study were a high tolerance for false positives and a multiple-choice option on deciding whether or not a light was seen. In the classic studies described above, the tolerance for false positives was so low that threshold was biased upward. Based on statistical analysis of a large number of trials, 6 photons each absorbed by one rod near-simultaneously looked "very bright," 5 photons looked "bright," 4 photons "a moderate light," 3 photons "a dim light." Two observers were able to see 2 photons as "''slightly'' doubtful if a light was seen." One observer saw a single photon as "''very'' doubtful if a light was seen." Zero photons were seen as "did not see anything."&lt;ref name="Uttal2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Uttal|first=William R.|title=A Taxonomy of Visual Processes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FG_pAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA389|accessdate=11 October 2014|date=27 June 2014|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-317-66895-4|page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reike|first=Fred|title=Vertebrae Phototransduction and the Visual Cycle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-_jaD2auP8C&amp;pg=PA186|accessdate=11 October 2014|date=19 April 2000|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-049673-3|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bialek2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bialek|first=William|authorlink=William Bialek|title=Biophysics: Searching for Principles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MLYJ5Rz3GLwC&amp;pg=PA40|accessdate=11 October 2014|date=4 November 2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1-4008-4557-2|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hearing==
{{Main article|Absolute threshold of hearing}}
The absolute threshold of hearing is the minimum [[Sound intensity level|sound level]] of a [[pure tone]] that an average ear with normal [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]] can hear with no other sound present. The absolute threshold relates to the [[sound]] that can just be heard by the organism.&lt;ref name="Durrant &amp; Lovrinic 1984"&gt;Durrant J D., Lovrinic J H. 1984. ''Bases of Hearing Sciences''. Second Edition. United States of America: Williams &amp; Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gelfand 2004"&gt;Gelfand S A., 2004. ''Hearing an Introduction to Psychological and Physiological Acoustics''. Fourth edition. United States of America: Marcel Dekker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The threshold of hearing is generally reported as the [[Root mean square|RMS]] [[sound pressure]] of 20 µPa (micropascals) = 2×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;  [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa). It is approximately the quietest sound a young human with undamaged hearing can detect at 1,000 [[Hertz|Hz]].&lt;ref name="Gelfand, 1990"&gt;Gelfand, S A., 1990. ''Hearing: An introduction to psychological and physiological acoustics''. 2nd edition. New York and Basel: Marcel Dekker, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The threshold of hearing is [[frequency]] dependent and it has been shown that the ear's sensitivity is best at frequencies between 1&amp;nbsp;kHz and 5&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="Gelfand, 1990"/&gt;

==Odor==
{{Main article|Odor detection threshold}}
The '''odor detection threshold''' is the lowest concentration of a certain [[odor]] compound that is perceivable by the human [[olfaction|sense of smell]]. The thresholds of a chemical compound is determined in part by its [[Molecular geometry|shape]], [[Chemical polarity|polarity]], [[partial charge]]s and [[molecular mass]].&lt;ref name="Visakh2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Visakh|first1=P. M.|last2=Iturriaga|first2=Laura B.|last3=Ribotta|first3=Pablo Daniel|title=Advances in Food Science and Nutrition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HNNiAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA280|accessdate=12 October 2014|date=17 December 2013|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-86553-8|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; The olfactory mechanisms responsible for a compound's different detection threshold is not well understood, as such, these thresholds cannot yet be accurately predicted. Rather, they must be measured through extensive tests using human subjects in laboratory settings.&lt;ref name="RhoadesBell2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rhoades|first1=Rodney A.|last2=Bell|first2=David R.|title=Medical Phisiology: Principles for Clinical Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1kGcFOKCUzkC&amp;pg=PA88|accessdate=12 October 2014|date=18 January 2012|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-1-60913-427-3|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2165">An '''agent of record''' ('''AOR''') is an individual or a legal entity with a duly executed contractual agreement with an [[insurance policy]] owner, in line with the prevailing legal norms and regulations of the region in which the contract was entered. The agent of record has a legal right to receive commissions from the respective insurance policy.

The individual or [[Legal personality|legal entity]] is authorized to represent an insured party in purchasing, servicing, and maintaining insurance coverage with a designated insurer. The majority of insurance companies will not disclose information or discuss an insured party's account with an agent other than the Agent of Record. An insured party wishing to change [[insurance agent]](s) must submit a revised agent of record letter&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluestarbenefits.wordpress.com/2007/06/22/agent-of-record-letter/ Agent of record letter]&lt;/ref&gt; to the respective insurer authorizing said insurer to release the insured party's information and to discuss the insured party's coverage with the newly appointed agent.

Relevant documents may be executed via hard copy documents or, alternatively, electronically in jurisdictions where electronic execution is legal. Applications may be made electronically, as well as in physical form.

An Agent of Record letter can, in some cases, be used as an insurance sales tool, though some question its legality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-12937881.html/ Agent of Record letters can lock in business accounts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disambiguation==
In the advertising and marketing industry, AOR stands for "Agency of Record." In this context, an AOR is an agency that is authorized to purchase advertising time (for radio or television advertising) or space (for print or web advertising) on behalf of the company with which they have an agency contract.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allbusiness.com/barrons_dictionary/dictionary-agency-of-record-4962111-1.html agency of record | Barrons Dictionary | AllBusiness.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

	'''Alexander Carl Heinrich Braun''' (10 May 1805 – 29 March 1877) was a German [[botanist]] from [[Regensburg]], Bavaria. His research centered on the morphology of plants.

==Biography==
He studied botany in [[Heidelberg]], [[Paris]] and [[Munich]]. In 1833 he began teaching botany at the Polytechnic School of [[Karlsruhe]], staying there until 1846. Afterwards he was a professor of botany in [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]] (from 1846), [[University of Giessen|Giessen]] (from 1850) and at the [[University of Berlin]] (1851), where he remained until 1877. While in Berlin, he was also director of the [[Berlin Botanical Garden|botanical garden]]. In 1852, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

Braun is largely known for his research involving [[plant morphology]]. He accepted evolution but was a critic of [[Darwinism]].&lt;ref&gt;Glick, Thomas F. (1988). ''The Comparative Reception of Darwinism''. University of Chicago Press. p. 86. {{ISBN|0-226-29977-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a proponent of [[vitalism]], a popular 19th century speculative theory that claimed that a regulative force existed within living matter in order to maintain functionality. Despite these beliefs, Braun made important contributions in the field of [[cell theory]].

From his 1830s analysis of the arrangement of scales on a [[pine cone]] he was a pioneer of [[phyllotaxis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/80/3/231.pdf] A History of the Study of Phyllotaxis&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877 [[Wilhelm Philippe Schimper]] and [[Philipp Bruch]] named the plant genus ''[[Braunia]]'' in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&amp;taxon_id=104560 EFloras, Flora of North America] Braunia Bruch &amp; Schimper&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a decorative plant known as "Braun's holly [[fern]]" (''[[Polystichum braunii]]'') commemorates his name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UNe-JB5ftKEC&amp;pg=PA326] Encyclopedia of garden ferns by Suzanne Olsen&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amishi Jha''' is an associate professor of [[psychology]] at the [[University of Miami]] whose research on [[attention]], [[working memory]], and [[mindfulness]] has investigated the neural bases of [[executive functioning]] and mental training using various cognitive neuroscience techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/system/files/2007_JCogNeurosci_Sreenivasan%2526Jha.pdf/ University of Pennsylvania]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625211241/http://psychology.sas.upenn.edu/system/files/2007_JCogNeurosci_Sreenivasan%26Jha.pdf/ |date=June 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Past studies have focused on the method by which attention selects information as relevant or irrelevant and how working memory then allows that information to be manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amishi.com/lab/assets/pdf/2002_CogBrainRes_Jha.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Jha's most recent research has examined mindfulness training with soldiers in the U.S. military with the Strong Projects as a tool in improving situational awareness and reducing stress measured through brainwave activity and cognitive behavioral tools. Her work has been featured in numerous publications, popular press articles, she has spoken at the [[World Economic Forum]], the [[Aspen Institute]], and the NY Academy of Sciences and has presented her research to the [[Dalai Lama]], [[Mind and Life Institute]], and Poptech.

==Education and career==
Jha received her B.S. in Psychology from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1993, and her PhD in Psychology from the [[University of California-Davis]] in 1998. During her graduate school she worked with [[Michael Gazzaniga]] and Ron Mangun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/faculty/mangun/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203010208/http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/faculty/mangun/ |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1998 to 2001 she completed her post-doctoral training in [[Neuroimaging]] and Functional MRI ([[fMRI]]), at [[Duke University]] with Gregory McCarthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.yale.edu/faculty/gregory-mccarthy |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000757/http://psychology.yale.edu/faculty/gregory-mccarthy |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2002 to 2010 she worked as an assistant professor at [[University of Pennsylvania]] at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and Department of Psychology. In 2010 she joined the [[University of Miami]] as an associate professor in the Department of Psychology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psy.miami.edu/faculty/ajha/ University of Miami Faculty Page]&lt;/ref&gt; Since arriving at the University of Miami, she has co-founded the Mindfulness Research and Practice Initiative and serves as the Director of Contemplative Neuroscience for that effort.

==Research==
Jha has examined the executive functioning mechanisms of the brain such as [[attention]], and [[working memory]], utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging, [[event related potential]], [[electroencephalography]], signal detection and behavioral methods. Her lab has investigated [[mindfulness]] training as a route to strengthen attentional processes as well as reduce perceived stress, and improve mood. Jha published one of the first studies on how attention may be modified by mindfulness training, and the first study of how mindfulness may protect against degradation in working memory in high stress groups, specifically military cohorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mind-fitness-training.org/JFQ_Mind_Fitness.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231803/http://www.mind-fitness-training.org/JFQ_Mind_Fitness.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research has followed two parallel lines of questioning – one seeking to determine the neural mechanisms of executive functioning and the other developing and evaluating ways to bolster executive functioning through training.

===Findings===
Jha's research into mindfulness-based training seeks to determine the benefits of mindfulness training and how this training changes cognitive and affective processes at neural and behavioral levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amishi.com/lab/wp-content/uploads/jha_stanley_etal_emotion_2010.pdf] Jha, A.P., Stanley, E.A., Kiyonaga, A., Wong, L., &amp; Gelfand., L. (2010). Examining the Protective Effects of Mindfulness Training on Working Memory and Affective Experience. Emotion, 10(1), 54–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Her findings have consistently shown that mindfulness training improves numerous aspects of both cognitive and emotional health. As well, she has demonstrated that there may be a dose-response effect of mindfulness training, so that greater benefits are observed with greater time spent engaging in mindfulness exercises.

====Military====
[[File:STRONG.jpg|thumb|STRONG Project logo]]Exposure to significant and potentially traumatizing stress is pervasive for military personnel during times of war. Such stress can lead to a degradation of psychological health with potentially dire consequences for the individual (e.g. [[PTSD]]), mission (e.g. impaired judgment), and family (e.g. divorce), amongst others. In some of the first studies of mindfulness training in the military, Jha partnered with the Mind Fitness Training Institute&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mind-fitness-training.org/ Mind Fitness Training Institute (MMFT)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102091949/http://www.mind-fitness-training.org/ |date=January 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and training developed and delivered by Dr. Elizabeth Stanley of [[Georgetown University]]. An 8-week mindfulness training course was offered to [[Marines]] preparing to deploy to Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.georgetown.edu/news/?ID=46897/ Georgetown University News: Interview with Elizabeth Stanley]&lt;/ref&gt; She found that the more time Marines spent engaging in mindfulness exercises outside of the classroom, the more they improved in their working memory and mood. Jha suggested that working memory capacity may be a core cognitive capacity necessary to preserve psychological resilience in high stress cohorts. These findings suggest that even in individuals facing extraordinary levels of stress, mindfulness training may help improve overall mental health and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mind-fitness-training.org/JFQ_Mind_Fitness.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231803/http://www.mind-fitness-training.org/JFQ_Mind_Fitness.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-02 |df= }} Joint Force Quarterly&lt;/ref&gt;

====Teachers====
In a recent study with teachers, Jha and collaborators looked at whether mindfulness training would be effective at improving the mental well-being of elementary and secondary school teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amishi.com/lab/wp-content/uploads/Jha_MindfulnessTrainingAndReductionsInTeacherStress_Apr2013.pdf] Roeser, R. W., Schonert-Reichl, K. A., Jha, A. P., Cullen, M., Wallace, L., Wilensky, R., Oberle, E., Thomson, K., Taylor, C., &amp; Harrison, J. (2013). Mindfulness Training and Reductions in Teacher Stress and Burnout: Results From Two Randomized, Waitlist-Control Field Trials. Journal of Educational Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the completion of the 8-week mindfulness training course, teachers reported less occupational stress, less occupational burnout, as well as lower symptoms of both depression and anxiety, while increasing their working memory capacity. Importantly, teachers who received mindfulness training continued to improve on all four measures over the three-month period following the completion of the course. This finding suggests that not only does mindfulness training have an immediate positive impact on emotional health but that the effects persist, providing long-term improvements in several aspects of well-being.

====Children====
Many types of contemplative practices, including mindfulness, train individuals to learn to control their attention, critical to success in a variety of settings, including school. In a recent study, Jha and colleagues sought to determine whether, and if so, how, concentrative meditation training can affect attentional processing in school age children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amishi.com/lab/wp-content/uploads/Davidson_etal_2012.pdf] Davidson, R., Dunne, J., Eccles, J. S., Engle, A., Greenberg, M., Jennings, P., Jha, A. P., Jinpa, T., Lantieri, L., Meyer, D., Roeser, R. W., &amp; Vago, D. (2012). Contemplative Practices and Mental Training: Prospects for American Education. Child Development Perspectives. 6(2): 146-153.
&lt;/ref&gt; The results indicated that even in children as young as 13, meditation training improved children's ability to achieve and maintain alertness. Additionally, training improved children's ability to resolve conflicts between divergent actions, which may improving their ability to complete tasks as instructed. These findings suggest that meditation training may improve academic performance.

In another study in children who are part of the juvenile justice system, Jha and [[NYU]] collaborators investigated if mindfulness training vs. an active comparison training might protect against degradation in attention that may accompany being incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amishi.com/lab/wp-content/uploads/Jha_MindfulnessTrainingImprovesAttentionalTaskPerformance_Nov2013.pdf] Leonard, N. R., Jha, A. P., Casarjian, B., Goolsaran, M., Garcia, C., Cleland, C. M., Gwadz, M. V., &amp; Massey, Z. (2013). Mindfulness Training Improves Attentional Task Performance in Incarcerated Youth: A Group Randomized Controlled Intervention Trial. Frontiers in Psychology.
&lt;/ref&gt; While those in the active comparison group degraded in their attention over a several month interval of being incarcerated, those in the mindfulness group did not. Again, Jha suggests that attention may serve as a core cognitive capacity necessary for resilience. In addition, attention is necessary for effective decision making under stress and regulation of behavior. Greater access to these capacities with mindfulness training may help promote resilience and reduce recidivism in children who have entered the juvenile justice system.

The '''Arab Press Network''' ('''APN''') ({{lang-fr|Place Réseau right la Presse Arabe}}) is a network of organisations that support and  promote the development of the press in the [[Arab world]]. It is run by the World Association of Newspapers, with its  headquarters in [[Paris]], and is supported by the Danish newspaper group JP/Politiken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabpressnetwork.org/aboutv2.php?lang%3Dfr |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601020235/http://www.arabpressnetwork.org/aboutv2.php?lang=fr |archivedate=2012-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to APN, their mission is to facilitate  associations between Arab journalists and editors in order to promote  a free press. On a commercial level, the network supports newspapers to grow  and expand  through practical advice.

The APN website contains news about the Arab world and on developments therein relating to freedom of the press.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3042">{{short description|unwanted secondary product of an item or process}}
A '''by-product''' is a secondary product derived from a manufacturing process or chemical reaction. It is not the primary product or service being produced. In the context of [[Manufacturing|production]], a by-product is the 'output from a joint production process that is minor in quantity and/or [[net realizable value]] (NRV) when compared with the main products'.&lt;ref&gt;Wouters, Mark; Selto, Frank H.; Hilton, Ronald W.; Maher, Michael W. (2012): ''Cost Management: Strategies for Business Decisions'', International Edition, McGraw-Hill, p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt; Because they are deemed to have no influence on reported financial results, by-products do not receive allocations of [[joint cost]]s. By-products also by convention are not inventoried, but the NRV from by-products is typically recognized as 'other income' or as a reduction of [[joint production process]]ing costs when the by-product is produced.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Trade Organization]] (2004): ''United States - Final dumping determination on softwood lumber from Canada'', WT/DS264/AB/R, 11 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; A by-product can be useful and marketable or it can be considered waste. For example, [[bran]] is a byproduct of the [[mill (grinding)|milling]] of refined [[flour]], sometimes [[compost]]ed or burned for disposal but in other cases used as a nutritious ingredient in [[food]] or [[animal feed|feed]], and [[gasoline]] was once a byproduct of [[oil refinery|oil refining]] that later became a desirable [[commodity]] as [[motor fuel]].

[[International Energy Agency|IEA]] defines "by-product" in the context of [[life-cycle assessment]]: "... main products, co-products (which involve similar revenues to the main product), by-products (which result in smaller revenues), and waste products (which provide little or no revenue)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ieabioenergy-task38.org/systemdefining/biomitre_technical_manual.pdf# |title=BIOMITRE Technical Manual, Horne, R. E. and Matthews, R., November 2004 |access-date=2011-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726171133/http://www.ieabioenergy-task38.org/systemdefining/biomitre_technical_manual.pdf# |archive-date=2011-07-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some chemists treat "by-product" and "side-product" as synonyms in the above sense of a generic secondary (untargeted) product, others find it useful to distinguish the two.  When the two terms are distinguished, "by-product" is used to refer to a product that is not desired but inevitably results from molecular fragments of starting materials and/or reagents that are not incorporated into the desired product, as a consequence of conservation of mass.  In contrast, "side-product" is used to refer to a product that is formed from a competitive process that could, in principle, be suppressed by optimization of reaction conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9798">According to Rieh (2005), "Patrick Wilson (1983) developed the '''cognitive authority''' theory from [[social epistemology]] in his book, ''Second-hand Knowledge: An Inquiry into Cognitive Authority''. The fundamental concept of Wilson’s cognitive authority is that people construct knowledge in two different ways: based on their first-hand experience or on what they have learned second-hand from others. What people learn first-hand depends on the stock of ideas they bring to the interpretation and understanding of their encounters with the world. People primarily depend on others for ideas as well as for information outside the range of direct experience. Much of what they think of the world is what they have gained second-hand. Wilson (1983) argues that all that people know of the world beyond the narrow range of their own lives is what others have told them. However, people do not count all hearsay as equally reliable; only those who are deemed to “know what they are talking about” become cognitive authorities. Wilson coined the term cognitive authority to explain the kind of authority that influences thoughts that people would consciously recognize being proper. Cognitive authority differs from administrative authority or the authority vented in a hierarchical position." (Rieh, 2005).

==Philosophical issues==
Wilson's dichotomy between first hand knowledge and second hand knowledge may be a trace left from empiricism. According to non-empiricist epistemologies such as hermeneutics and pragmatism even our first hand knowledge (our perception) is influenced by our culture and hence - mostly indirectly and unconsciously - by cognitive authorities: the way we learn to look at things when brought up in a culture and socialized into a subculture and a domain.

The concept of cognitive authority is important because it forces us to be [[skeptical]] towards claims in the literature and elsewhere. It forces us to consider the criteria we should use when evaluating information [[:wikt:source|source]]s. In other words: It forces us to consider [[epistemological]] issues.

Different "movements", "paradigms", "positions" or "schools" in a given field tend to have different cognitive authorities. 
 
"Most people, even most academics, do not have the time, training, or occasion to work through the technical literature on a controversial topic, and so, they must rely on professionals for a disinterested evaluation" (Herrnstein, 1973, pp.&amp;nbsp;52,53; quoted from Tucker, 1994). Tucker shows, however, that the recognized experts within the field of intelligence research blindly accepted [[Cyril Burt]]'s research even though it was without scientific value and probably directly faked: They wanted to believe that [[IQ]] was hereditary, and considered uncritically empirical claims supporting this view. When a researcher from another field ([[Leon Kamin]]) first demonstrated that Burt's results were wrong, he was not considered a cognitive authority. When his criticism was considered unavoidable, the established researchers tried to change history and deprive Kamin of his intellectual credit. This example shows something about how cognitive authority may be ascribed in the real world.  
 
The concept of cognitive authority also raises the question of the role of experts. On the one hand, it is dangerous to blindly believe claims originating from "experts" while on the other hand, "commonsensism" is also a problematic epistemology. John Dewey (1920) discussed this dilemma and worked on improving general education in order to make the general public less vulnerable to the power of experts.

==Example: The cognitive authority of professional historians==
In about 1880, history was established as an academic discipline and as a profession based on that discipline in both Europe and the USA. The cognitive authority of history was closely related to the application of scientific methods and [[source criticism]]. A clear division was established between amateur historians and professional, scientific historians. From the dominant "paradigm" in the historical profession of that time, it was clear what to consider "cognitive authority".

However, inside history, the "paradigm" shifted to "the present period of confusion, polarization, and uncertainty, in which the idea of historical objectivity has become more problematic than ever before".&lt;ref&gt;(Novick, 1988, p. 16-17)&lt;/ref&gt;

For some the development has turned around and amateurs have the same cognitive authority as professional historians: "[I]t is not the purportedly objective investigations
of the historian into a real subject matter which lead to knowledge about history, but rather the
knowledge at which the historian arrives is conditioned
by the linguistic mode in which she/he operates.
Professional historiography for White [1973] generates no
more objective knowledge of the past than does speculative philosophy of history or the historical
novel." &lt;ref&gt;(Iggers, 2001, 6772)&lt;/ref&gt;

What is considered "cognitive authority" in a given field of knowledge is thus relative and depending on the "paradigm" of the information seeker. An argument about what should be regarded "cognitive authority" is in the end an epistemological argument.

==Implications for library and information science==
The concept of cognitive authority was developed in [[library and information science]] and has attracted a lot of attention in this field. Its importance for this field is related to questions such as: What criteria should be used for selecting information sources? For advising users about selecting information? For interpreting user studies and relevance judgments? All such issues involve questions of cognitive authority and epistemology.

"Perhaps we [library and information professionals] should learn to be more critical of the very concept of authority. Authority is legitimate only within the boundaries of the community (subject or otherwise) in which it is based. Many questions pertain to areas claimed by competing disciplines, and some to areas beyond the bounds of recognized disciplinary communities. Even when we are able to locate authoritative sources with answers to questions, they tend to be less certain than they look, and greater authority is no guarantee of quality. Authority tells us only that the creators of the source have qualifications and institutional affiliations that match the expectations of a given disciplinary community, not that the source is infallible, or even that its disciplinary community is the best to pursue the information sought" (Pierce, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;31).

The '''Cortex Plus System''' is a toolkit RPG system that evolved from [[Margaret Weis Productions, Ltd]]'s [[Cortex System]].  It has been used for four published games and one published preview to date, and the design principles are in the '''Cortex Plus Hacker's Guide''',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Of the four games published using this system, [[Leverage: The Roleplaying Game]] was nominated for the 2011 Origins Award for best Role Playing Game,&lt;ref name="Leverage RPG on RPG Geek"&gt;[http://rpggeek.com/rpg/4883/leverage-the-roleplaying-game Leverage RPG on RPG Geek]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marvel Heroic Roleplaying]] won the 2013 award and the award for best support as well as the 2012 [[ENnie Award]] for Best Rules and runner up for Best Game.&lt;ref name="rpggeek.com"&gt;[http://rpggeek.com/rpg/16869/marvel-heroic-roleplaying Marvel Heroic Roleplaying on RPG Geek]&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that despite the similarity in name, ''Cortex Plus'' is not the [[Cortex System]], also produced by Margaret Weis Productions.

==System==

Unlike the [[Cortex System]], Cortex Plus is a roll and keep system in which you roll one die from each category and keep the two highest dice in your [[dice pool]].  What goes into your dice pool is whatever is considered important for the game you are playing - but different stories have different things they consider important so the implementation of the system has been different for each game so far.  All versions of Cortex Plus use standard polyhedral dice and the normal [[dice notation]] ranging from d4 (a 4 sided tetrahedral die) to d12 (a 12-sided dodecahedral die), and narratively notable features are given dice from this list, with d6 being the default.

In all cases Cortex Plus uses dice pools ranging from d4 (terrible) to d12 (the best possible), and every die in your pool that rolls a natural 1 (called an 'Opportunity') doesn't count toward your total and causes some form of negative consequence which, depending on the game, either creates a complication for the characters to overcome or adds to the Doom Pool that provides the [[Game Master]] resources within the scene.  Adding a d4 to your dice pool is considered a penalty because it isn't likely to roll one of your best two die results and there's such a high chance of rolling a 1.

Most versions of Cortex Plus (other than Smallville) give the character a set of three distinctions that they can choose to add to their dice pool either as a d8 to assist them, or as a d4 to hinder them - but they gain a plot point by using the d4 option.

Equipment is normally handled by enabling the character to do things (you can't shoot someone without a gun) but where it is especially notable it is given a dice rating and added to the dice pool as an asset.  And things that get in the way are treated similarly, and added to the dice pool as complications.

Cortex Plus also uses [[Plot point (role-playing games)|Plot Points]] - the normal uses of which are to establish something as notable (turning it into an asset), power a stunt or ability, to add a die to your roll, or to keep an additional die after you have rolled.

===Action===

Cortex Plus Action is used in both the Leverage and [[Firefly Role-Playing Game]]s, and is the most traditional of the three.  The important factors are an ''attribute'' (Leverage uses the six from the [[Cortex System]], Firefly uses Physical/Mental/Social), a ''Skill'' (Leverage uses Grifter, Hacker, Hitter, Mastermind, and Thief which are based on the TV show.  Firefly has a list of 22).  Also in the dice pool can be a distinction, an asset, and a complication affecting the opposition.

Leverage, as a [[Heist film|Heist]] or [[Confidence trick|Con]] game allows characters to spend a plot point to establish [[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback scenes]] to explain what is really going on and why things are not as bad as they appear.

===Drama===

Cortex Plus Drama is used in the [[Smallville Roleplaying Game]], which was the first Cortex Plus game.  It has the most complicated character generation; the players start by drawing a relationship map that step by step ties the player characters to each other and the gameworld.  Instead of attributes and skills, the important factors are considered Relationships with other characters and Values (Duty, Glory, Justice, Love, Power, Truth in Smallville) and each relationship and values having a statement attached and you can use the dice when acting in line with the statement.  A character can also challenge a value statement and possibly reject it, allowing them to use it three times in the dice pool on that roll - but using a smaller die for the rest of the session every time they want to invoke that value or relationship.

When a character loses a contest and doesn't give in Smallville they take stress (Insecure, Afraid, Angry, Exhausted, and Injured) which can be used against them - or they can use at the cost of increasing the amount of stress they've taken, and being unable to act beyond d12 stress.

===Heroic===

Cortex Plus Heroic was written for [[Marvel Heroic Roleplaying]] and has the largest dice pools.  In addition to distinctions, assets, complications, and stress (as used in Drama - with stress being Physical, Mental, and Emotional in Marvel Heroic), Cortex Plus Heroic characters have an Affiliation (Solo, Buddy, Team), at least one powerset and possibly more, and some Specialities (which represent a mix of skills, resources, and contacts).  The powersets are further detailed with [[Special effect|Sfx]] and Limits so they more closely represent the vision of the character, and character creation is largely freeform.  Unlike other Cortex Plus games, the default is to keep three dice with the third die representing the effect size and not being added to the total, only the size of this die mattering. This third die is known as the Effect Die.  Marvel Heroic Roleplaying commonly uses large dice pools with seven separate categories (and potentially more than one power set).  The dice in Marvel Heroic are:

From the character:
* ''Distinction'' which may be invoked either positively for a d8 or negatively for a [[dice notation|d4]] (more chance of being a complication, little chance of being one of the best two dice)
* ''Affiliation'' (Solo/Budy/Team).  This reflects who the character is with and the nature of the scene.  Each character has one at d6, one at d8, one at d10.
* ''Power Sets'' - representing the characters' powers.  To better represent a character's abilities these are tweaked with [[Special effect|Sfx]] and limits.  One die per power set by default - but Sfx can increase this.
* ''Speciality'' which represents a mix of character skill, knowledge, and connections in their specialty field. Experts are rated d8, and Masters d10.  A d10 speciality may be replaced by 2d8 or 3d6 and a d8 speciality may be replaced by 2d6.

There are also three potential dice from the situation:
* ''Asset'' - a situational advantage or an object that's been created earlier.
* ''Resource'' created in a "transition scene" a resource represents a character building something with their skill or calling on their contacts in advance.
* ''Their opponent's state'' - opponents may have taken ''stress'' (i.e. harm) or ''complications'' (i.e. temporary disadvantages) from previous actions, and one die for this may be included.

Extra dice may be included through [[Plot point (role-playing games)|Plot Points]], and characters seldom use all those dice.

Reception to Cortex Plus games has been good, with [[Marvel Heroic Roleplaying]] winning best rules at the 2012 [[ENnie Awards]].&lt;ref name="2012 ENnies"&gt;[http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/congratulations-to-the-2012-ennie-award-winners/ 2012 ENnie Award winners]&lt;/ref&gt;  A common theme in reviews is that there are no procedural elements, and you are instead rolling based on what you consider relevant to the situation&lt;ref name="RPGamer Smallville"&gt;[http://www.rpgamer.com/savingthrow/reviews/rev-SV.html Review of Smallville Roleplaying Game]  - RPGamer&lt;/ref&gt; and the way that 1s add narrative complications to the results that would not normally be expected in other role-playing games.&lt;ref name="SFSignal"&gt;[http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2013/03/roll-perception-plus-awareness-the-marvel-heroic-roleplaying-game/ Roll Perception Plus Awareness - SFSignal review of Marvel Heroic Roleplaying]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another theme picked up on in the system is the way that it allows balance between characters such as [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Captain America]] while having enough meat to distinguish them.&lt;ref name="io9 MHRP"&gt;[http://io9.com/5888568/reshape-wolverine-and-spider+mans-worlds-with-the-new-marvel-rpg Reshape Wolverine and Spider-man's world with the new Marvel RPG] - [[io9]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carbonyl oxide (Criegee zwitterion).svg|thumb|Criegee [[zwitterion]]]]

A '''Criegee intermediate''' (also called a '''Criegee [[zwitterion]]''' or '''Criegee [[biradical]]''') is a [[carbonyl]] [[oxide]] with two charge centres. These [[molecules]] help to break down [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen dioxide]] in the atmosphere, and may help offset [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Oliver |last1= Welz |first2= John D. |last2= Savee |first3= David L. |last3= Osborn |first4= Subith S. |last4= Vasu |first5= Carl J. |last5= Percival |first6= Dudley E. |last6= Shallcross |first7= Craig A. |last7= Taatjes |title= Direct Kinetic Measurements of Criegee Intermediate (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OO) Formed by Reaction of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; |journal= Science |date= 13 January 2012 |volume= 335 |issue= 6065 |pages= 204–207 |doi= 10.1126/science.1213229 |bibcode = 2012Sci...335..204W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MSNBC&gt;{{cite news| last=Castro| first=Joseph| title=How mysterious molecules may help cool Earth|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45975663/ns/technology_and_science-science/#.TxCB1PmGmSo|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|accessdate=2012-01-12 |date= January 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of this sort of structure was first postulated in the 1950s by [[Rudolf Criegee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120112142232.htm | title= Offsetting Global Warming: Molecule in Earth's Atmosphere Could 'Cool the Planet' | date= January 12, 2012| publisher= [[Science Daily]] | accessdate= 2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; for whom it is named, but it was not until 2013 that direct detection of such chemicals was reported.

In [[electromagnetism]], '''current density''' is the [[electric current]] per unit area of cross section. The '''current density vector''' is defined as a [[vector (geometric)|vector]] whose magnitude is the [[electric current]] per cross-sectional area at a given point in space, its direction being that of the motion of the charges at this point. In [[SI unit]]s, the electric current density is measured in [[ampere]]s per [[square metre]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), R.G. Lerner, G.L. Trigg, VHC publishers, 1991, ISBN (Verlagsgesellschaft) 3-527-26954-1, ISBN (VHC Inc.) 0-89573-752-3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Assume that ''A'' (SI unit: [[metre|m]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is a small surface centred at a given point ''M'' and orthogonal to the motion of the charges at ''M''. If ''I''{{sub|''A''}} (SI unit: [[ampere|A]]) is the [[electric current]] flowing through ''A'', then '''electric current density''' ''J'' at ''M'' is given by the [[limit of a function|limit]]:&lt;ref&gt;Essential Principles of Physics, P.M. Whelan, M.J. Hodgeson, 2nd Edition, 1978, John Murray, {{ISBN|0-7195-3382-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;J = \lim\limits_{A \rightarrow 0}\frac{I_A}{A},&lt;/math&gt;

with surface ''A'' remaining centred at ''M'' and orthogonal to the motion of the charges during the limit process.

The '''current density vector''' '''J''' is the vector whose magnitude is the electric current density, and whose direction is the same as the motion of the charges at ''M''.

At a given time ''t'', if '''v''' is the speed of the charges at ''M'', and ''dA'' is an infinitesimal surface centred at ''M'' and orthogonal to '''v''', then during an amount of time ''dt'', only the charge contained in the volume formed by ''dA'' and {{nowrap|1='''l''' = '''v''' ''dt''}} will flow through ''dA''. This charge is equal to {{nowrap|''ρ'' {{!!}}''v''{{!!}} d''t'' d''A''}}, where ''ρ'' is the charge density at ''M'', and the electric current at ''M'' is {{nowrap|1=''I'' = ''ρ'' {{!!}}''v''{{!!}} ''dA''}}. It follows that the current density vector can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;J = \rho \mathbf{v}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[surface integral]] of '''J''' over a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] ''S'', followed by an integral over the time duration ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, gives the total amount of charge flowing through the surface in that time ({{nowrap|''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}):

:&lt;math&gt;q=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\iint_S \mathbf{J}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}}\,{\rm d}A{\rm d}t. &lt;/math&gt;

More concisely, this is the integral of the [[flux]] of '''J''' across ''S'' between ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The [[area]] required to calculate the flux is real or imaginary, flat or curved, either as a cross-sectional area or a surface. For example, for charge carriers passing through an [[electrical conductor]], the area is the cross-section of the conductor, at the section considered.

The [[vector area]] is a combination of the magnitude of the area through which the charge carriers pass, ''A'', and a [[unit vector]] normal to the area, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. The relation is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = A \mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the current density '''J''' passes through the area at an angle ''θ'' to the area normal &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}}= J\cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;

where '''⋅''' is the [[dot product]] of the unit vectors. That is, the component of current density passing through the surface (i.e. normal to it) is {{nowrap|''J'' cos ''θ''}}, while the component of current density passing tangential to the area is {{nowrap|''J'' sin ''θ''}}, but there is ''no'' current density actually passing ''through'' the area in the tangential direction. The ''only'' component of current density passing normal to the area is the cosine component.

==Importance==
Current density is important to the design of electrical and [[electronics|electronic]] systems.

Circuit performance depends strongly upon the designed current level, and the current density then is determined by the dimensions of the conducting elements. For example, as [[integrated circuit]]s are reduced in size, despite the lower current demanded by smaller [[semiconductor devices|devices]], there is a trend toward higher current densities to achieve higher device numbers in ever smaller [[semiconductor chip|chip]] areas. See [[Moore's law]].

At high frequencies, the conducting region in a wire becomes confined near its surface which increases the current density in this region. This is known as the [[skin effect]].  

High current densities have undesirable consequences. Most electrical conductors have a finite, positive [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], making them dissipate [[Power (physics)|power]] in the form of heat.  The current density must be kept sufficiently low to prevent the conductor from melting or burning up, the [[electrical insulator|insulating material]] failing, or the desired electrical properties changing. At high current densities the material forming the interconnections actually moves, a phenomenon called ''[[electromigration]]''.  In [[superconductivity|superconductors]] excessive current density may generate a strong enough magnetic field to cause spontaneous loss of the superconductive property.

The analysis and observation of current density also is used to probe the physics underlying the nature of solids, including not only metals, but also semiconductors and insulators. An elaborate theoretical formalism has developed to explain many fundamental observations.&lt;ref name= Martin&gt;{{cite book |title=Electronic Structure:Basic theory and practical methods |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmRTFLpSGNsC&amp;pg=PA316&amp;dq=isbn=0-521-78285-6#PPA369,M1 |author=Richard P Martin |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-521-78285-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Altland&gt;{{cite book |title=Condensed Matter Field Theory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0KMkfAMe3JkC&amp;pg=RA4-PA557&amp;dq=isbn=978-0-521-84508-3#PRA2-PA378,M1  |author=Alexander Altland &amp; Ben Simons |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-521-84508-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current density is an important parameter in [[Ampère's circuital law]] (one of [[Maxwell's equations]]), which relates current density to [[magnetic field]].

In [[special relativity]] theory, charge and current are combined into a [[4-vector]].

==Calculation of current densities in matter==

===Free currents===
Charge carriers which are free to move constitute a [[free current]] density, which are given by expressions such as those in this section.

Electric current is a coarse, average quantity that tells what is happening in an entire wire. At position '''r''' at time ''t'', the ''distribution'' of [[electric charge|charge]] flowing is described by the current density:&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Handbook of Physics Formulas, G. Woan, Cambridge University Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-521-57507-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \rho(\mathbf{r},t) \; \mathbf{v}_\text{d} (\mathbf{r},t) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where '''J'''('''r''',&amp;thinsp;''t'') is the current density vector, '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;('''r''',&amp;thinsp;''t'') is the particles' average [[drift velocity]] (SI unit: [[metre|m]]∙[[second|s]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), and

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{r}, t)= qn(\mathbf{r},t) &lt;/math&gt;

is the [[charge density]] (SI unit: coulombs per [[cubic metre]]), in which ''n''('''r''',&amp;thinsp;''t'') is the number of particles per unit volume ("number density") (SI unit: m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;), ''q'' is the charge of the individual particles with density ''n'' (SI unit: [[coulomb]]s).

A common approximation to the current density assumes the current simply is proportional to the electric field, as expressed by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \sigma \mathbf{E} \, &lt;/math&gt;

where '''E''' is the [[electric field]] and ''σ'' is the [[electrical conductivity]].

Conductivity ''σ'' is the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] ([[invertible matrix|inverse]]) of electrical [[resistivity]] and has the SI units of [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] per [[metre]] (S⋅m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and '''E''' has the [[SI]] units of [[newton (unit)|newton]]s per [[coulomb]] (N⋅C&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;) or, equivalently, [[volt]]s per [[metre]] (V⋅m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

A more fundamental approach to calculation of current density is based upon:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} (\mathbf{r}, t) =  \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d}t' \int \mathrm{d}^3\mathbf{r}' \; \sigma(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}', t-t') \; \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}',\ t') \, &lt;/math&gt;

indicating the lag in response by the time dependence of ''σ'', and the non-local nature of response to the field by the spatial dependence of ''σ'', both calculated in principle from an underlying microscopic analysis, for example, in the case of small enough fields, the [[linear response function]] for the conductive behaviour in the material. See, for example, Giuliani or Rammer.&lt;ref name=Giuliani&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantum Theory of the Electron Liquid |author=Gabriele Giuliani, Giovanni Vignale |page=111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFkIKRfgUpsC&amp;pg=PA538&amp;dq=%22linear+response+theory%22+capacitance+OR+conductance#PPA111,M1 |isbn=0-521-82112-6 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rammer&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantum Field Theory of Non-equilibrium States |author=Jørgen Rammer |page=158 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7TbrAm5Wq0C&amp;pg=PR6&amp;dq=%22linear+response+theory%22+capacitance+OR+conductance#PPA158,M1 |isbn=0-521-87499-8 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The integral extends over the entire past history up to the present time.

The above conductivity and its associated current density reflect the fundamental mechanisms underlying charge transport in the medium, both in time and over distance.

A [[Fourier transform]] in space and time then results in:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} (\mathbf{k}, \omega) = \sigma(\mathbf{k}, \omega) \; \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{k}, \omega) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ''('''k''',&amp;thinsp;''ω'') is now a [[Complex function#Complex functions|complex function]].

In many materials, for example, in crystalline materials, the conductivity is a [[tensor]], and the current is not necessarily in the same direction as the applied field. Aside from the material properties themselves, the application of magnetic fields can alter conductive behaviour.

===Polarization and magnetization currents===
Currents arise in materials when there is a non-uniform distribution of charge.&lt;ref name="Electromagnetism 2008"&gt;Electromagnetism (2nd Edition), I.S. Grant, W.R. Phillips, Manchester Physics, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-471-92712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In [[dielectric]] materials, there is a current density corresponding to the net movement of [[electric dipole moment]]s per unit volume, i.e. the [[polarization density|polarization]] '''P''':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{P}=\frac{\partial \mathbf{P}}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly with [[magnetic materials]], circulations of the [[magnetic dipole moment]]s per unit volume, i.e. the [[magnetization]] '''M,''' lead to [[magnetization current]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herczynski|first=Andrzej|date=2013|year=|title=Bound charges and currents|url=http://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/schools/cas_sites/physics/pdf/herczynski/AJP-81-202.pdf|journal=American Journal of Physics|publisher=the American Association of Physics Teachers|publication-date=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1119/1.4773441|bibcode=2013AmJPh..81..202H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{M}=\nabla\times\mathbf{M} &lt;/math&gt;

Together, these terms add up to form the [[bound current]] density in the material (resultant current due to movements of electric and magnetic dipole moments per unit volume):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{b}=\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{P}+\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{M} &lt;/math&gt;

===Total current in materials===

The total current is simply the sum of the free and bound currents:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{J}_\mathrm{f}+\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{b} &lt;/math&gt;

===Displacement current===
There is also a [[displacement current]] corresponding to the time-varying [[electric displacement field]] '''D''':&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Electrodynamics (3rd Edition), D.J. Griffiths, Pearson Education, Dorling Kindersley, 2007, {{ISBN|81-7758-293-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Physics for Scientists and Engineers - with Modern Physics (6th Edition), P. A. Tipler, G. Mosca, Freeman, 2008, {{ISBN|0-7167-8964-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{D}=\frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

which is an important term in [[Ampere's circuital law]], one of Maxwell's equations, since absence of this term would not predict [[electromagnetic waves]] to propagate, or the time evolution of [[electric field]]s in general.

== Continuity equation ==
{{main|Continuity equation}}
Since charge is conserved, current density must satisfy a [[continuity equation]]. Here is a derivation from first principles.&lt;ref name="Electromagnetism 2008"/&gt;

The net flow out of some volume ''V'' (which can have an arbitrary shape but fixed for the calculation) must equal the net change in charge held inside the volume:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_S{ \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}} = -\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \int_V{\rho \; \mathrm{d}V} = - \int_V{ \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}\;\mathrm{d}V}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ'' is the [[charge density]], and ''d'''A''''' is a [[surface integral|surface element]] of the surface ''S'' enclosing the volume ''V''. The surface integral on the left expresses the current ''outflow'' from the volume, and the negatively signed [[volume integral]] on the right expresses the ''decrease'' in the total charge inside the volume. From the [[divergence theorem]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_S{ \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}} = \int_V{\mathbf{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{J}\;  \mathrm{d}V}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_V{\mathbf{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{J}\; \mathrm{d}V}\ = - \int_V{ \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} \;\mathrm{d}V}&lt;/math&gt;

This relation is valid for any volume, independent of size or location, which implies that:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = - \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

and this relation is called the [[continuity equation]].&lt;ref name=Chow&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Electromagnetic Theory: A modern perspective |author = Tai L Chow |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dpnpMhw1zo8C&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=isbn=0-7637-3827-1#PPA204,M1 |isbn=0-7637-3827-1 |year=2006 |pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Griffiths&gt;{{cite book |author= Griffiths, D.J. |title=Introduction to Electrodynamics |page=213 |publisher=Pearson/Addison-Wesley |year=1999 |isbn=0-13-805326-X |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In practice ==
In [[electrical wiring]], the maximum current density can vary from 4&amp;nbsp;A⋅mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; for a wire with no air circulation around it,  to 6&amp;nbsp;A⋅mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; for a wire in free air. Regulations for [[building wiring]] list the maximum allowed current of each size of cable in differing conditions. For compact designs, such as windings of [[Switched-mode power supply|SMPS transformers]], the value might be as low as 2&amp;nbsp;A⋅mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=A. Pressman |display-authors=etal |title=Switching power supply design |edition=3rd |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-148272-1 |year=2009 |page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the wire is carrying high frequency currents, the [[skin effect]] may affect the distribution of the current across the section by concentrating the current on the surface of the [[electrical conductor|conductor]]. In [[transformer]]s designed for high frequencies, loss is reduced if [[Litz wire]] is used for the windings. This is made of multiple isolated wires in parallel with a diameter twice the [[skin depth]]. The isolated strands are twisted together to increase the total skin area and to reduce the [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] due to skin effects.

For the top and bottom layers of [[printed circuit boards]],  the maximum current density can be as high as 35&amp;nbsp;A⋅mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; with a copper thickness of 35&amp;nbsp;μm. Inner layers cannot dissipate as much heat as outer layers; designers of circuit  boards avoid putting high-current traces on inner layers.

In the [[semiconductors]] field, the maximum current densities for different elements are given by the manufacturer. Exceeding those limits raises the following problems:
* The [[Joule heating|joule effect]] which increases the temperature of the component.
* The [[electromigration|electromigration effect]] which will erode the interconnection and eventually cause an open circuit.
* The slow [[diffusion|diffusion effect]] which, if exposed to high temperatures continuously, will move metallic ions and [[Doping_(semiconductor)|dopants]] away from where they should be. This effect is also synonym to ageing.

The following table gives an idea of the maximum current density for various materials.

Even if manufacturers add some margin to their numbers, it is recommended to, at least, double the calculated section to improve the reliability, especially for high quality electronics. One can also notice the importance to keep electronic devices cool to avoid them to be exposed to [[electromigration]] and slow [[diffusion]].

In [[biological organism]]s, [[ion channel]]s regulate the flow of [[ion]]s (for example, [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[potassium]]) across the [[Cell membrane|membrane]] in all [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. Current density is measured in pA⋅pF&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Metric prefix|pico]][[ampere]]s per [[Metric prefix|pico]][[farad]]), that is, current divided by [[capacitance]], a de facto measure of membrane area.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}

In [[gas discharge lamp]]s, such as [[flashlamp]]s, current density plays an important role in the output [[spectroscopy|spectrum]] produced. Low current densities produce [[spectral line]] [[emission spectrum|emission]] and tend to favour longer [[wavelength]]s. High current densities produce continuum emission and tend to favour shorter wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;[https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/1811/5654/1/V71N06_343.pdf Xenon lamp photocathodes]&lt;/ref&gt; Low current densities for flash lamps are generally around 10&amp;nbsp;A⋅mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. High current densities can be more than 40&amp;nbsp;A⋅mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.

 [https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-cute-aggression-16884 "Explainer: what is cute aggression?"] ''[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]'', 10 September 2013. Accessed 2 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; is a superficially [[aggression|aggressive]] behaviour or reaction caused by experiencing something [[cuteness|cute]], especially a [[human baby]] or young animal.&lt;ref name=Aragon2015&gt;Oriana R. Aragón, Margaret S. Clark, Rebecca L. Dyer and John A. Bargh (2015) [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614561044 "Dimorphous Expressions of Positive Emotion: Displays of Both Care and Aggression in Response to Cute Stimuli"], 
''Psychological Science'', 26(3): 259-273 (27 January 2015). doi: 10.1177/0956797614561044&lt;/ref&gt; People experiencing playful aggression may grit their teeth, clench their fists, or feel the urge to pinch and squeeze something they consider cute, while not actually causing or intending to cause any harm.&lt;ref name=Aragon2015/&gt;

==Terminology==
The term "cute aggression" was published widely in 2013, after Rebecca Dyer presented research on the topic at the annual meeting of the [[Society for Personality and Social Psychology]] on January 18.&lt;ref name=Conversation/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pappas&gt;Stephanie Pappas (2013) [https://www.livescience.com/26452-why-we-go-crazy-for-cuteness.html "'I Wanna Eat You Up!' Why We Go Crazy for Cute"] ''LiveScience'', 21 January 2013. Accessed 2 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "playful aggression" was subsequently used in a 2015 paper by Oriana R. Aragón and colleagues,&lt;ref name=Aragon2015/&gt; and defined as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Playful aggression is in reference to the expressions that people show sometimes when interacting with babies. Sometimes we say things and appear to be more angry than happy, even though we are happy. For example some people grit their teeth, clench their hands, pinch cheeks, or say things like “I want to eat you up!” It would be difficult to ask about every possible behavior of playful aggression, so we ask generally about things of this kind—calling them playful aggressions.&lt;ref name=Aragon2015/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The concept of playful aggression is also captured in several non-[[English language|English]] terms.&lt;ref name=Lateral&gt;Amy Smith (2017) [http://www.lateralmag.com/articles/issue-24/cute-anger-management "Cute anger management"] ''Lateral'' magazine, 9 August 2017. Accessed 2 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Filipino language|Filipino]], for example, the word ''gigil'' refers to "the gritting of teeth and the urge to pinch or squeeze something that is unbearably cute."&lt;ref name=Aragon2015/&gt;

==Function==
Playful aggression is a type of dimorphous display, in which a positive experience elicits expressions usually associated with negative emotions.&lt;ref name=Aragon2015/&gt; This behaviour occurs more commonly in individuals who experience dimorphous emotions across a range of situations, and may help to regulate emotions by balancing an overwhelmingly positive emotion with a negative response.&lt;ref name=Aragon2015/&gt;

'''Fairfield Materials Management Ltd''' is a [[Manchester]] based  [[social enterprise]] that operates a community waste management project at Manchester’s New Smithfield Market focused on minimising waste, and bringing social and environmental benefits to Greater Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairfieldcompost.co.uk/about/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

By utilising '[[in-vessel composting]]', Fairfield Materials Management established the UK’s first sustainable [[biodegradable]] [[waste management]] system to operate on a wholesale market,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairfieldcompost.co.uk/about.html&lt;/ref&gt; diverted 16,500 tonnes of organic market waste material away from [[landfill]] between 2003 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairfieldcompost.co.uk/what_we_do.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairfield has developed a composting production model that processes fruit, vegetable, plant and woody waste into [[peat]]-free, [[British Standards Institution]] PAS 100&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrap.org.uk/composting/compost_
specifications/bsi_pas_100/bsi_pas_100_1.
&lt;/ref&gt; accredited compost.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.letsrecycle.com/materials/composting/news.jsp?story=5785&lt;/ref&gt; It operates on a site fully licensed by the [[Environment Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairfieldcompost.co.uk/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Fairfield was recognised as the most innovative social enterprise within its sector by The Composting Association.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.compostingconference.com/Community_Init_Award.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Fairfield Materials Management was founded in 2003 by a small group of ecological activists, horticulturists and social entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairfieldcompost.co.uk/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairfield Materials Management was initiated by Val Rawlinson (Director) after she became involved in an East Manchester anti-incineration campaign in 1996. The incinerator was not built, but Lucy Danger and Val Rawlinson realised that they had to show Manchester that environmental and social alternatives were available and working successfully throughout the United Kingdom and so Fairfield Composting was established by Val who began promoting home composting and supplying compost bins.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.debdale-eco-centre.com&lt;/ref&gt; and Lucy set up EMERGE Recycling recruiting Val as a director.

Val also recognised the need for a commercial sized composting system for New Smithfield Market and choose a Vertical Composting Unit (VCU) system as the preferred technology; Emma Smith was recruited as a waste auditor in November 2001 to undertake a waste composition analysis of Smithfield Market's waste.  Chris Walsh joined the team and between 2001 and 2003 the group secured several hundred thousand pounds through grants and loans,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adventurecapitalfund.org.uk/content/view/28/59/&lt;/ref&gt; designed the site, obtaining planning permission and a waste management licence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.communitycompost.org/hotrotters/fmm.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Fairfield began operating and initially diverted waste from four market traders, taking in [[green waste]] from [[Manchester City Council]] and producing compost.  In 2004 a further two composting units were added and in 2005 a final three units were added to the system.  This enabled Fairfield to process all of the market's fruit and vegetable waste through the in-situ technology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairfieldcompost.co.uk/about/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst remaining a director of Fairfield Val set up Debdale Eco Centre(DEC) and with Emma's help secured funding to promote home composting.  WRAP funding later enabled DEC to run a project supplying low cost compost bins which achieved high home composting levels.  When Manchester City Council working in partnership with BIFFA introduced the Green Bin home composting levels were reduced negating the work undertaken by Val. Val retired from DEC aged 70 in 2010 but continues as a Director of Fairfield  

The business became sustainable through the efforts of Ian Trippier who was recruited as office manager bringing his vast experience of social enterprises and business acumen to the organisation. Ian and Eric Lowry, Operations Manager, have proved an invaluable partnership raising standards in Waste Management and turning Fairfield into a very successful organisation.   

In 2009 the Fairfield Group in partnership national [[renewable energy]] business Bio Group Ltd &lt;ref&gt;http://www.crainsmanchesterbusiness.co.uk/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090106/FREE/301069997/1046/energy&lt;/ref&gt; secured planning permission in [[Bredbury]], [[Stockport]] for their second waste management site.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.englandsnorthwest.com/invest/news/archive/8162-food-recycle-plant-approved.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Flowers in a glass vase on a partly draped stone ledge''''' is a circa 1667 floral painting by [[Nicolaes van Verendael]] in the collection of the [[Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url={{#if: {{wikidata|property|Q29882478|P350}} | https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/{{wikidata|property|Q29882478|P350}} | {{wikidata|property|Q29882478|P973}} }}|title={{wikidata|label|Q29882478}}|publisher={{wikidata|property|linked|Q29882478|P195}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history and creation==
[[File:Nicolaes van Verendael - Garland surrounding the Virgin Mary.jpg|thumb|Garland painting in the Prado]]
Nicolaes van Verendael was a respected flower painter in Antwerp who worked with [[Jan Davidsz. de Heem]], among others. The early provenance of this painting is unknown but it can be dated based on other works by Van Verendael, such as his garland painting in the [[Prado]] which was long attributed to [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]], who began floral painting in Antwerp a half-century beforehand.
==Description and interpretation==
This painting dates to the period in Antwerp when hothouses became popular among the nobility and patrons ordered paintings to record their personal hothouse triumphs. Not all of the blooms would have bloomed at the same time, and the painting was meant more for decoration than for botanical accuracy. The work shows the following flower species: [[Rosa × alba|Rosa alba]], [[Tropaeolum majus]], [[Anemone hepatica|Hepatica nobilis]], [[rosemary]], [[Tulip|Tulipa]], [[Delphinium]], [[Aquilegia]], [[Pomegranate|Punica granatum]], [[Rosa × centifolia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/nl/explore/images/198239 Painting record] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later history and influence==
This painting was stored for safe-keeping during WWII in the [[Albrechtsburg]] in [[Meissen]], from whence it was found and taken by marauding Soviet troops in 1945. Somehow it ended up in the possession of a German citizen who later migrated to Canada and it appeared on the art market in the 1970s, whereupon it was returned to the museum after 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.codart.nl/museums/after-70-years-in-exile-nicolaes-van-verendael-s-flower-still-life-returns-to-the-suermondt-ludwig-museum-in-aachen/ After 70 years in exile Nicolaes van Verendael’s Flower Still Life returns to the Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum in Aachen], article 4 March 2015 on codart&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought''''' is a 1995 book by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] and other members of the Fluid Analogies Research Group exploring the mechanisms of [[intelligence]] through [[computer model]]ing. It contends that the notions of [[analogy]] and fluidity are fundamental to explain how the human [[mind]] solves problems and to create computer programs that show intelligent behavior. It analyzes several computer programs that members of the group have created over the years to solve problems that require intelligence.

It was the first book ever sold by [[Amazon.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-corporateTimeline|title=Amazon Media Room: History &amp; Timeline|website=phx.corporate-ir.net|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the book==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
The book is a collection of revised articles that appeared in precedence, each preceded by an introduction by Hofstadter.
They describe the scientific work by him and his collaborators in the 1980s and 1990s.
The project started in the late 1970s at Indiana University.
In 1983 he took a sabbatical year at MIT, working in [[Marvin Minsky]]'s Artificial Intelligence Lab.
There he met and collaborated with [[Melanie Mitchell]], who then became his doctoral student.
Subsequently, Hofstadter moved to the University of Michigan, where the FARG (Fluid Analogies Research Group) was founded.
Eventually he returned to Indiana University in 1988, continuing the FARG research there.
The book was written during a sabbatical year at the Istituto per la Ricerca Scientifica e Tecnologica in Trento, Italy.

==Publication==
Upon publication, [[Jon Udell]], a [[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]] senior technical editor-at-large said:&lt;ref name="byte"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fifteen years ago, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach|Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]'' exploded on the literary scene, earning its author a [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction#1980s|Pulitzer prize]] and a monthly column in ''[[Scientific American]]''. Douglas Hofstadter's exuberant synthesis of math, music, and art, and his inspired thought experiments with "tangled hierarchy," recursion, pattern recognition, figure/ground reversal, and self-reference, delighted armchair philosophers and AI theorists. But in the end, many people believed that these intellectual games yielded no useful model of cognition on which to base future AI research. Now ''Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies'' presents that model, along with the computer programs Hofstadter and his associates have designed to test it. These programs work in stripped-down yet surprisingly rich microdomains.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On April 3, 1995, ''Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies'' became the first book ordered online by an Amazon.com customer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/meet-amazons-first-ever-customer-2015-04-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of chapters==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}

===Chapter 1:To Seek Whence Cometh a Sequence===
The first [[AI]] project by Hofstadter stemmed from his teenage fascination with [[integer sequence|number sequences]].
When he was 17, he studied the way that [[triangular numbers|triangular]] and [[square numbers]] interleave, and eventually found a [[recursive relation]] describing it.
In his first course on AI, he set to the students and to himself the task of writing a program that could extrapolate the rule by which a numeric sequence is generated.
He discusses [[Breadth-first search|breadth-first]] and [[Depth-first search|depth-first]] techniques, but eventually concludes that the results represent [[expert system]]s that incarnate a lot of technical knowledge but don't shine much light on the mental processes that humans use to solve such puzzles.

Instead he devised a simplified version of the problem, called SeekWhence, where sequences are based on very simple basic rules not requiring advanced mathematical knowledge.
He argues that [[pattern recognition]], analogy, and fluid working hypotheses are fundamental to understand how humans tackle such problems.

===Chapter 2:The Architecture of Jumbo===
Jumbo is a program to solve [[jumble]]s, word puzzles consisting in five or six scrambled letters that need to be [[anagram]]med to form an English word.
The resulting word does not need to be a real one but just to a plausible, that is, to consists of a sequence of letters that is normal in English.

The constituent elements of Jumbo are the following:
* The "chunkabet": a database of chunks, small sequences of letters, with a numeric value giving their strength as possible components of a word.
* The "[[cytoplasm]]": a loose data structure containing partial associations of letter, modeling a form of [[working memory]]. The name is inspired by the place in a cell where molecular fragments are assembled into proteins.
* The "Coderack": a structure containing "codelets", small pieces of programs that are waiting to be executed in the cytoplasm; the codelet that is executed next is chosen non-deterministically, based on urgencies attached to them; a codelet may form new associations, break down old ones, or generate more codelets.
A "temperature" is associated to the present state of the cytoplasm; it determines how probable it is that a destructive codelet is executed.
There is a "freezing" temperature at which no destruction can occur anymore: a solution has been found.

===Chapter 3:Numbo: A Study in Cognition and Recognition===
Numbo is a program by [[Daniel Defays]] that tries to solve numerical problems similar to those used in the French game [[Des chiffres et des lettres#Le compte est bon .28.22the total is right.22.29|"Le compte est bon"]]. The game consists in combining some numbers called "bricks", using the operations of multiplication, addition, and subtraction, to obtain a given result.

The program is modeled on Jumbo and [[Copycat (software)|Copycat]] and uses a permanent network of known mathematical facts, a working memory in the form of a cytoplasm, and a coderack containing codelets to produce free associations of bricks in order to arrive at the result.

===Chapter 4:Highlevel Perception, Representation, and Analogy===
The chapter subtitle ''A Critique of Artificial-intelligence Methodology'' indicates that this is a polemical article, in which [[David Chalmers]], [[Robert M. French|Robert French]], and [[Douglas_Hofstadter|Hofstadter]] criticize most of the research going on at that time (the early '80s) as exaggerating results and missing the central features of human intelligence.

Some of these AI projects, like the [[structure mapping engine]] (SME), claimed to model high faculties of the human mind and to be able to understand literary analogies and to rediscover important scientific breakthroughs.
In the introduction, Hofstadter warns about the [[Eliza effect]] that leads people to attribute understanding to a computer program that only uses a few stock phrases.
The authors claim that the input data for such impressive results are already heavily structured in the direction of the intended discovery and only a simple matching task is left to the computer.

Their main claim is that it is impossible to model high-level cognition without at the same time modeling low-level perception.
While cognition is necessarily based on perception, they argue that it in turn influences perception itself.
Therefore, a sound AI project should try to model the two together.
In a slogan repeated several times throughout the book: ''cognition is recognition''.

Since human perception is too complex to be modelled by available technology, they favor the restriction of AI projects to limited domains like the one used for the Copycat project.

===Chapter 5:The Copycat Project===
This chapter presents, as stated in the full title, ''A Model of Mental Fluidity and Analogy-making''.
It is a description of the architecture of the [[Copycat (software)|Copycat]] program, developed by Hofstadter and [[Melanie Mitchell]].
The field of application of the program is a domain of short alphabetic sequences.
A typical puzzle is: ''If '''abc''' were changed to '''abd''', how would you change '''ijk''' in the same way?''.
The program tries to find an answer using a strategy supposedly similar to the way the human mind tackles the question.

Copycat has three major components:
*The ''Slipnet'', a model of long-term memory in humans. It contains concepts of various degrees of abstraction, from the letter types to the notion of ''opposite''. Concepts are connected with links indicating their similarity. The activation of a node may cause the activation of a neighbor with a probability proportional to the inverse of the length of their link. The lengths of these links are not static; they have a value at the beginning but they may change elastically during computation according to the partial results achieved.
*The ''Workspace'', a model of short-term memory. Here partial structures are constructed and dismantled. The temporary results may cause the activation of concepts in the slipnet. A ''temperature'' measures the satisfaction of the program with the structure obtained at each moment. High temperature means dissatisfaction and leads to the adoption of a different strategy. Low temperature means satisfaction and the continuation of the present strategy.
*The ''Coderack'', a collection of ''codelets'', that is small fragments of code, that wait to be selected and executed in the workspace. Each has a weight associated to it that determined its probability to be selected for execution.
The resulting software displays emergent properties.
It works according to a ''[[parallel terraced scan]]'' that runs several possible processes at the same time.
It shows mental fluidity in that concepts may ''slip'' into similar ones.
It emulates human behavior in tending to find the most obvious solutions most of the time but being more satisfied (as witnessed by low temperature) by more clever and deep answers that it finds more rarely.

===Chapter 6:Perspectives on Copycat===
This chapter compares Copycat with other recent (at the time) work in [[artificial intelligence]].
Specifically, it matches it with the claimed results from the [[structure mapping engine]] SME and the [[Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine]] (ACME).
The authors' judgment is that those programs suffer from two defects: Their input is pre-structured by the developers to highlight the analogies that the software is supposed to find; and the general architecture of the programs is serial and deterministic rather than parallel and stochastic like Copycat's, which they consider psychologically more plausible.

Severe criticism is put on the claim that these tools can solve "real-life" problems.
In fact, only the terms used in the example suggest that the input to the programs comes from a concrete situation.
The logical structures don't actually imply any meaning for the term.

Finally a more positive assessment is given to two other projects: Indurkhya' PAN model and Kokinov's AMBR system.

===Chapter 7:Prolegomena to Any Future Metacat===
This chapter looks at those aspects of human creativity that are not yet modeled by Copycat and lays down a research plan for a future extension of the software.
The main missing element is the mind's ability to observe itself and reflect on its own thinking process.
Also important is the ability to learn and to remember the results of the mental activity.

The creativity displayed in finding analogies should be applicable at ever higher levels: making analogies between analogies (expression inspired by the title of a book by [[Stanislaw Ulam]]), analogies between these second-order analogies, and so on.

===Chapter 8:Tabletop, BattleOp, Ob-Platte, Potelbat, Belpatto, Platobet===
Another of Hofstadter's students, Robert French, was assigned the task of applying the architecture of Copycat to a different domain, consisting in analogies between objects lying on a table in a coffeehouse.
The resulting program was named Tabletop.

The authors present a different and vaster domain to justify the relevance of attacking such a trivial-seeming project.
The alternative domain is called Ob-Platte and consists in discovering analogies between geographical locations in different regions or countries.

Once again arguments are offered against a brute-force approach, which would work on the small Tabletop domain but would become unfeasible on the larger Ob-Platte domain.
Instead a parallel non-deterministic architecture is used, similar to the one adopted by the Copycat project.

===Chapter 9:The Emergent Personality of Tabletop, a Perception-based Model of Analogy-making===
In the premise to the chapter, title ''The Knotty Problem of Evaluating Research'', Hofstadter considers the question of how research in AI should be assessed.
He argues against a strict adherence to a match between the results of an AI program with the average answer of human test subjects.
He gives two reasons for his rejection: the AI program is supposed to emulate creativity, while an average of human responses will delete any original insight by any of the single subjects; and the architecture of the program should be more important that its mere functional description.

In the main article, the architecture of Tabletop is described: it is strongly inspired by that of Copycat and consists of a Slipnet, a Workspace, and a Corerack.

===Chapter 10:Letter Spirit===
This last chapter is about a more ambitious project that Hofstadter started with student Gary McGraw.
The microdomain used is that of grid fonts: typographic alphabets constructed using a rigid system of small rigid components.
The goal is to construct a program that, given only a few or just one letter from the grid font, can generate the whole alphabet ''in the same style''.
The difficulty lies in the ambiguity and undefinability of ''style''.
The projected program would have a structure very similar to that of Jumble, Numble, Copycat, and Tabletop.

===Epilogue===
In the concluding part of the book, Hofstadter analyses some AI projects with a critical eye.
He finds that today's AI is missing the gist of human creativity and is making exaggerated claims.
The project under scrutiny are the following.

[[AARON]], a computer artist that can draw images of people in outdoor settings in a distinctive style reminiscent of that of a human artist; criticism: the program doesn't have any understanding of the objects it draws, it just uses some graphical algorithms with some randomness thrown in to generate different scenes at every run and to give the style a more natural feel.

[[Racter]], a computer author that wrote a book entitled ''The Policeman's Beard Is Half Constructed''.
Although some of the prose generated by the program is quite impressive, due in part to the [[Eliza effect]], the computer does not have any notion of plot or of the meaning of the words it uses. Furthermore, the book is made up of selected texts from thousands produced by the computer over several years.

[[Automated Mathematician|AM]], a computer mathematician that generates new mathematical concepts. It managed to produce by itself the notion of [[prime number]] and the [[Goldbach conjecture]]. As with Racter, the question is how much the programmer filtered the output of the program, keeping only the occasional interesting output.
Also, mathematics being a very specialized domain, it is doubtful whether the techniques used can be abstracted to general cognition.

Another mathematical program, called Geometry, was celebrated for making an insightful discovery of an original proof that an isosceles triangle has equal base angles. The proof is based on seeing the triangle in two different ways. However, the program generates all possible ways of seeing the triangle, not even knowing that it is the same triangle.

Hofstadter concludes with some methodological remarks on the [[Turing Test]].
In his opinion it is still a good definition and he argues that by interacting with a program, a human may be able to have insight not just on its behaviour but also on its structure.
However, he criticises the use that is made of it at present: it encourages the development of fancy{{Peacock term|date=December 2015}} natural-language interfaces instead of the investigation of deep cognitive faculties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17010">The topic of gender and emotion is often reduced to attempts to identify the differences between women, men, and the various ways in which they express their emotions. Stereotypes are powerful, and men and women from various cultures have been shown to accept the Western stereotype that women are more emotional than men.&lt;ref name= kring&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kring | first1 = A. M. | last2 = Gordon | first2 = A. H. | year = 1998 | title = Sex differences in emotion: expression, experience, and physiology | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.74.3.686 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = 3| pages = 686–703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, women are believed to experience and express discrete emotions such as happiness, fear, disgust, and sadness more than men. 

Many researchers have concluded that the observed emotional differences between men and women primarily stem from socialized [[gender role]]s, rather than biology.  Thus, the range of [[emotional expression]] that certain populations experience is based, in large part, on their culture's expectations for [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wester | first1 = S. | last2 = Vogel | first2 = D. | last3 = Pressly | first3 = P. | last4 = Heesacker | first4 = M. | year = 2002 | title = Sex Differences in Emotion: A Critical Review of the Literature and Implications for Counseling Psychology | url = | journal = The Counseling Psychologist | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 630–652 | doi=10.1177/00100002030004008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major theories==
Many psychologists reject the notion that men actually experience emotions less frequently than do women.  Instead, researchers have suggested that men exhibit restrictive [[emotionality]]. Restrictive emotionality refers to a tendency to inhibit the expression of certain emotions and an unwillingness to self-disclose intimate feelings.&lt;ref name = jansz /&gt; Men's restrictive emotionality has been shown to influence health, emotional appraisal and overall identity.  Furthermore, tendencies toward restrictive emotionality are correlated with an increased risk of certain anxiety disorders.&lt;ref name = jansz /&gt;
A substantial amount of research has suggested that women do, on average, express emotions more frequently than men.&lt;ref name = kring /&gt; In the Handbook of Emotions, Leslie R. Brody and Judith A. Hall report that This difference in emotional expression starts at a young age, as early as 4 and 6 years old, as girls begin to express more sadness and anxiety than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;&lt;ref name = brody&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brody | first1 = L. R. | last2 = Hall | first2 = J. A. | year = 2008 | title = Gender and emotion in context | url = | journal = Handbook of emotions | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 395–408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brody and Hall (2008) report that women generally smile, laugh, nod and use hand gestures more than men do.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;  The only known exception to this rule is that men more frequently express anger.  However, all of these effects are not commonly observed until after preschool, suggesting that these differences might be the result of certain [[socialization]] processes.&lt;ref name = jansz&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jansz | first1 = J | year = 2000 | title = [[Masculine]] identity and restrictive emotionality | url = | journal = Gender and emotion: Social psychological perspectives | volume = | issue = | pages = 166–186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Women are also more accurate expressers of emotion, when "posing deliberately and when observed unobstrusively."&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;  This increased expressiveness in emotional expression is consistent across cultures – women report more intense emotional experiences and more overt emotional expressions across 37 cultures.&lt;ref name =  fischer&gt;Fischer, A. H., &amp; Manstead, A. S. R. (2000). The relation between gender and emotion in different cultures. In A. H. Fischer (Ed.), Gender and emotion: Social psychological perspectives (pp. 71–98). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been found that men and women more accurately display gender-stereotypic expressions – men more accurately express anger, contempt and happiness, while women were more accurately express fear and happiness.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;  Other studies have shown that women show higher levels of expression accuracy and judgement of nonverbal emotional cues than men overall.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt; However, these patterns are not consistent across cultures, again suggesting that socialization influences the observed gender differences in emotional expression.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;  For example, in [[Japan]], research has suggested that women convey anger and contempt better than men do.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;

==Major empirical findings==
Research has shown that culture and context-specific gender roles have a stronger influence on emotional expression than do biological factors.  "Empirical evidence suggests that girls are socialized to be emotional, nonaggressive, nurturing, and obedient, whereas boys are socialized to be unemotional, aggressive, achievement oriented, and self-reliant. Peers continue this process as children develop and mature in effect constraining how, where, why, and with whom certain emotions are expressed".&lt;ref name = wester/&gt;  One study suggests that people tend to exhibit more intense negative facial expressions in solitary conditions, and smile more when others are present.  In this experiment, men and women did not differ in their anger expression in non-social conditions. However, women were more likely to express their anger in the solitary condition as opposed to the social condition. Men, on the other hand, seemed to be less concerned with appearing positive to others; they showed no difference in their expression of anger based on whether or not others were present.&lt;ref name = derks/&gt;  In another recent study, Coats and Feldman found that women who were more accurate expressors of happiness were judged as more popular, while men who were more accurate expressors of anger were judged as more popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coats | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Feldman | first2 = R. S. | year = 1996 | title = Gender differences in nonverbal correlates of social status | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 22 | issue = 10| pages = 1014–1022 | doi=10.1177/01461672962210004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that there are negative consequences for people who are less accurate expressors of gender-stereotypical emotions.

These consequences also extend to judging others' emotions. Studies have shown that there are negative social consequences for children who are deficient at judging gender-stereotypic nonverbal cues – angry nonverbal cues for boys and happy, sad, and fearful nonverbal cues for girls.  Communication of emotion involves both detection and expression of emotions or moods. The ability to detect non-verbal cues leads to successful communication of emotions. In [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC), the absence of body language and visibility restricts one's ability to correctly recognize other's [[emotion]]s.  For this reason, emoticons are widely used  in online communication to replace non-verbal behaviors that emphasize or clarify one's feelings.  Surprisingly, there is no static gender difference in the use of emoticons.  In some studies, both men and women display an increase in emoticon use in the context of a mixed-gender group chat.  Others show that men use more emoticons when interacting with women, while women show no change when interacting with men.&lt;ref name = derks&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Derks | first1 = Daantje | last2 = Fischer | first2 = Agneta H. | last3 = Bos | first3 = Arjan E.R. | year = 2008 | title = The role of emotion in computer-mediated communication: A review | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 766–785 | doi =  10.1016/j.chb.2007.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature versus nurture==
{{Main article|Nature versus nurture}}
The social-developmental hypothesis is one of the major arguments for the impact of nurture on emotional expression.  The social-developmental theory explains gender differences in emotion expression through emphasizing "children's active role in their development of gendered behavior" through learning by watching adults or through interactions with their parents and peers (Chaplin &amp; Aldao, 2012).&lt;ref name= chaplin&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chaplin | first1 = T. | last2 = Aldao | first2 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Gender differences in emotion expression in children: A meta-analytic review | url = http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/bul-a0030737.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 139 | issue = 4| pages = 735–765 | doi=10.1037/a0030737 | pmid=23231534 | pmc=3597769}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis points to the fact that infants are not born with the same differences in emotional expression and gender differences generally grow more pronounced as children age.  In a 2012 meta-analysis conducted by Tara Chaplin and Amelia Aldao, researchers reviewed gender differences in emotion expression from the infancy period through adolescence in order to determine the impact of development and age on gender differences. Their findings support the notion that social factors in a child's development play a large role in the gender differences that later emerge, as "gender differences were not found in infancy…but they emerged by the toddler/preschool period and in childhood".&lt;ref name= chaplin /&gt; One possible explanation for this developmental difference comes from the child's parents.  In many Western cultures, for example, parents discuss and express a broader range of emotions with their daughters than their sons.&lt;ref name = wester&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wester | first1 = S. | last2 = Vogel | first2 = D. | last3 = Pressly | first3 = P. | last4 = Heesacker | first4 = M. | year = 2002 | title = Sex Differences in Emotion: A Critical Review of the Literature and Implications for Counseling Psychology | url = http://www.sagepub.com/counselingstudy/Journal%20Articles/Wester.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The Counseling Psychologist | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 630–652 | doi=10.1177/00100002030004008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As children grow older, these patterns continue with their peers.

The second major argument in support of social influences on emotion expression involves the idea that a society's gender roles reinforce gender differences.  The social constructionist theory states that children grow up in the context of gender roles that naturally place them in role-specific situations, influencing their emotion expression in that context.  Gender stereotypes in [[heteronormative]] societies enforce expectations for women to suppress anger and contempt, but express other emotions using words and facial expressions.  Simultaneously, these same cultural norms discourage men from verbally expressing emotions, with the exception of anger or contempt (Wester, Pressly, &amp; Heesacker, 2002).&lt;ref name = wester/&gt; As an adaptive feature, regulation of expression of emotion involves the consideration the social demands of any given situation.  Studies have shown that "fewer gender differences in emotion expression may be found when children are with someone they trust and know well than when children are with an unfamiliar person" (Chaplin &amp; Aldao, 2012).&lt;ref name=chaplin /&gt; Generally, people are trained to behave in a "socially acceptable" way around strangers or acquaintances, suggesting that the social context of an environment can shape the levels of emotion expression.

Biological factors also play a role in influencing emotion expression.  One central biological argument is related to cognitive differences between genders. In a 2008 study using functional magnetic reasoning imaging (fMRI) to monitor brain activity in participants, researchers found that men and women differ in neural responses when experiencing negative emotions. "Compared with women, men showed lesser increases in prefrontal regions that are associated with reappraisal, greater decreases in the amygdala, which is associated with emotional responding, and lesser engagement of ventral striatal regions, which are associated with reward processing" (McRae, Ochsner, Mauss, Gabrieli, &amp; Gross, 2008).&lt;ref name="mcrae"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McRae|first1=K.|last2=Ochsner|first2=K. N.|last3=Mauss|first3=I. B.|last4=Gabrieli|first4=J. J.|last5=Gross|first5=J. J.|year=2008|title=Gender differences in emotion regulation: An fMRI study of cognitive reappraisal|url=|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|volume=11|issue=2|pages=143–162|doi=10.1177/1368430207088035}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way that male and female brains respond to emotions likely impacts the expression of those emotions.

The biological roots of gender differences interact with the social environment in various ways.  Biological theorists propose that females and males have innate differences that exist at birth, but unfold with age and maturation in response to interactions with their specific environments (Chaplin &amp; Aldao, 2012).&lt;ref name = chaplin/&gt; An important argument for this viewpoint is that "gender differences in emotion expression are the result of a combination of biologically based temperamental predispositions and the socialization of boys and girls to adopt gender-related display rules for emotion expression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brody | first1 = L | year = 1997 | title = Gender and Emotion: Beyond Stereotypes | url = | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 53 | issue = 2| pages = 369–394 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-4560.1997.tb02448.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that even infant males display higher levels of activity and arousal than do infant girls as well as a lower ability for language and behavior inhibitory controls, which are biologically-based characteristics.  This "nature" argument interacts with "nurture" in that "parents and other socialization agents may respond to boys in ways that dampen emotional expressiveness…as a way to down-regulate their high emotional arousal and activity levels".&lt;ref name = chaplin/&gt; On the other hand, girls are encouraged to utilize their higher vocabulary and communication skills to verbally express their emotions to parents and other adults, which would also highlight expression differences between genders.

== "Man-box" ==
References to a figurative "man-box", an idea often attributed to [[TED (conference)|TED]] speaker Tony Porter, attempts to describe the societal restrictions on a man's freedom of emotional expression. As Porter describes, this restriction is a primary reason for high rates of violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Porter|first=Tony|title=A call to men|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/tony_porter_a_call_to_men|language=en|accessdate=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his organization, ''A Call to Men'', Porter and his team organize initiatives and create awareness about what it means to possess "healthy manhood".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acalltomen.org/about-us/our-vision/|title=Mission/Vision|website=A Call To Men|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'man-box' is an analogous attempt to shed light on some of the cultural and social barriers we impose on men such as emotional reservedness, lack of physical intimacy with other men, and expectations of aggressive and/or dominant behavior in social environments.

==Controversies==
Emotions are complex and involve different components, such as physiological arousal, expressive behaviors, and conscious experience. While the expressive component of emotion has been widely studied, it remains unclear whether or not men and women differ in other aspects of emotion.  Most researchers agree that women are more emotionally expressive, but not that they experience more emotions than men do.&lt;ref name = kring /&gt; Some studies have shown that women are more likely to produce inauthentic smiles than men do, while others have shown the opposite.  This debate is significant because emotion can be generated by adopting an action that is associated with a particular emotion, such as smiling and speaking softly.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;

A possible explanation is that both men and women's emotional expressiveness is susceptible to social factors. Men and women may be reinforced by social and cultural standards to express emotions differently, but it is not necessarily true in terms of experiencing emotions. For instance, studies suggest that women often occupy roles that conform to feminine display rules, which require them to amplify their emotional response to impress others.&lt;ref name = derks /&gt;

== Definition ==
'''Human rights education''' is defined as the learning process that builds up the required knowledge, values, and proficiency of human rights of which the objective is to develop an acceptable human rights culture. This type of learning teaches students to examine their experiences from the human rights point of view enabling them to integrate these concepts into their values and decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/what_is_human_rights_education|title=WHAT is human rights education?|website=www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Amnesty International]], human rights education is a way to empower people so that they can create skills and behavior that would promote dignity and equality within the community, society, and all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/human-rights-education/|title=Human Rights Education|website=www.amnesty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-Discrimination ===
The ''National Economic and Social Rights'' Initiative stated the importance of Non-Discrimination in Human Rights Education. Governments must see to it that it must be exercised without bias to race, gender, color, religion, language, national or social origin, political or personal opinion, birth, or any status. All students, parents, and communities possess the right to take part in decisions affecting their respective schools and the right to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nesri.org/programs/what-is-the-human-right-to-education|title=Join NESRI in supporting people's movements for human rights|website=www.nesri.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human Rights Education and Training ==
The [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|OHCHR]] promotes Human Rights Education by supporting national and local initiatives for HRE within the context of its ''Technical Cooperation Programs''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Countries/Pages/TechnicalCooperationIndex.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}}  	Technical Cooperation Homepage|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through the ACT Project which subsidizes the grassroots projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Education/Training/ACTProject/Pages/ACTProjectIndex.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}}  	ACT Project overview|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACT or ''Assisting Communities Together Project'' is the collaboration between the OHCHR and the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Program]] (UNDP)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/extrabudgetary-projects-on-freedom-of-expression/development-partners/united-nations-development-programme-undp/|title=United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; to make grants available for civil society organizations in implementing human rights activities in local communities.

The OHCHR also develops preferred Human Rights Education training materials and resource tools such as the Database on Human Rights Education and Training,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hre.ohchr.org/hret/intro.aspx|title=Database on human rights education and training|website=hre.ohchr.org|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resource Collection on Human Rights Education and Training,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Education/Training/Pages/Collection.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}}  	Resource Collection on Human Rights Education and Training|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and web section on the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it takes care of coordinating the World Program for Human Rights Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Education/Training/Pages/Programme.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}}  	World Programme for Human Rights Education (2005-ongoing)|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Universal Declaration of Human Rights ===
The ''Universal Declaration of Human Rights'' is acknowledged as a landmark document in human rights history. It was drafted by representatives from various countries and regions with varying legal and cultural experiences. The [[United Nations General Assembly]] proclaimed this declaration in Paris, France on December 10, 1948. This Declaration states that basic human rights require protection. It was translated into more than 500 languages worldwide.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== Demand for Human Rights Education ==
The demand for human rights education continues to grow globally. Academic institutions are in the position to train students as future business leaders capable of managing human rights impact on their respective corporate organizations. The [[United Nations Global Compact]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unglobalcompact.org/take-action/action/human-rights-open-letter-to-academics|title=Make Human Rights Part of Management Education {{!}} UN Global Compact|website=www.unglobalcompact.org|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in cooperation with the Principles for Responsible Management Education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://responsiblebusiness.haas.berkeley.edu/curriculum/prme.html|title=Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME) - Center for Responsible Business {{!}} Berkeley-Haas|website=responsiblebusiness.haas.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; invites different corporations to incorporate business along with human rights topics to their curricula. 

The Asia-Pacific Center for Education for International Understanding and the [[United Nations Academic Impact]] mutually organized the 2018 United Nations Global Citizenship Education Seminar at the UN Headquarters in New York City.  These seminars are useful in the formulation of new ideas and concepts related to HRE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://academicimpact.un.org/content/2018-united-nations-global-citizenship-education-seminar|title=2018 United Nations Global Citizenship Education Seminar|last=OmarHernandez|date=2018-05-09|website=academicimpact.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Education is crucial because it is one of the keys to making governments and political leaders accountable. It also imparts and spreads out the human rights vocabulary and provides a critical approach towards human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=From Citizenship to Human Rights to Human Rights Education|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5040/9781472566461.ch-009|work=Making Human Rights Intelligible : Towards a Sociology of Human Rights|publisher=Hart Publishing|isbn=9781849463959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights education and the United Nations==
The United Nations High Commissioner for the Promotion and Protection of all Human Rights functions as coordinator of the UN Education and Public Information Programs in the area of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r141.htm|title=A/RES/48/141.  High Commissioner for the promotion and protection of all human rights|website=www.un.org|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] has proclaimed it as central to the achievement of the rights enshrined in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html |publisher=United Nations General Assembly |quote=Following this historic act the Assembly called upon all Member countries to publicize the text of the Declaration and "to cause it to be disseminated, displayed, read and expounded principally in schools and other educational institutions, without distinction based on the political status of countries or territories. |title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights |date=10 December 1948 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208080853/http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html |archivedate=8 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|Now, Therefore THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY proclaims THIS UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms...|||Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948}}

Article 26.2 of the UDHR states the role of educators in achieving the [[social order]] called for by the declaration:

{{Cquote|Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace.|||Article 26.2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights}}

Article 29 of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] requires states to ensure that children are enabled to develop a respect for their own cultural identity, language and values and for the culture, language and values of others.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Ruane (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of human rights was reaffirmed by the United Nations in the 1993 [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]]:

{{Cquote|The World Conference on Human Rights reaffirms that States are duty-bound, as stipulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in other [[international human rights instruments]], to ensure that education is aimed at strengthening the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms.|||Paragraph 33, section 1 of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/pdf/vienna.pdf|title=Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action|publisher=United Nations|date=25 June 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Cquote|States should strive to eradicate [[illiteracy]] and should direct education toward the full development of the human personality and to the strengtheng of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The World Conference on Human Rights calls on all States and institutions to include human rights, [[humanitarian law]], [[democracy]] and [[rule of law]] as subjects in curricula of all learning institutions in formal and non- formal settings. Human rights education should include peace, democracy, development and [[social justice]], as set forth in international and regional human rights instruments, in order to achieve common understanding and awareness with a view to strengthening universal commitment to human rights.|||Paragraph 79 and 80, section 2 of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action}}

As a result of the Vienna Declaration the decade from 1995 to 2004 was declared the ''UN Decade of Human Rights Education''.&lt;ref&gt;General Assembly resolution 49/184 of 23 December 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/education/training/decade.htm|title=UN Decade of Human Rights Education|publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216055141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/education/training/decade.htm|archivedate=16 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights education history==
The emphasis on Human Rights Education began in 1995 with the beginning of the UN Decade for Human Rights Education, though previously addressed in 1953 with the UNESCO Associated Schools Program, which served as an “initial attempt to teach human rights in formal school settings”. The first formal request for the need to educate students about human rights came about in UNESCO’s 1974 article Recommendation concerning Education for International Understanding, Cooperation and Peace, and Education Relating to Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  The participants of the International Congress on the Teaching of Humans Rights eventually met in 1978 to form a specific definition of what would be required application of the education in formal curricula. The aims at which the Congress agreed upon including the encouragement of tolerant attitudes with focus on respect, providing knowledge of human rights in the context of national and international dimensions as well as their implementations, and finally developing awareness of human rights translating into reality whether social or political on national and international levels.

Human Rights Education became an official central concern internationally after the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993.  This conference brought the issue of educating formally to the top of many countries’ priority lists and was brought to the attention of the United Nations. It was two years later that the United Nations approved the Decade for Human Rights Education, which reformed the aims of application once again. Since the development of the UN Decade, the incorporation of human rights education into formal school curricula has been developed and diversified with the assistance of nongovernmental organizations, intergovernmental organizations, and individuals dedicated to spreading the topic through formal education.

Today{{When|date=April 2017}} the most influential document used to determine what qualifies as human rights and how to implement these ideas and rights into everyday life is the Universal Declaration.  The declaration was adopted by the General Assembly in 1948, making December 10 annual [[Human Rights Day]] ever since.  To this day the 30 article compilation is seen{{By whom|date=April 2017}} as “a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humanrightseducation.info&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights education organizations==

{{Importance section|date=July 2018}}

[http://aihr-iadh.org/ '''Arab Institute for Human Rights''']
The Arab Institute for Human Rights is an independent Arab non-governmental
organization based in Tunisia. It was founded in 1989 at the initiative of the Arab Organization for Human Rights, the Arab Lawyers Union, and the Tunisian League for Human Rights and with the support of the United Nations Centre for Human Rights. The Institute received the UNESCO International Award for Human Rights Education for the year 1992.
Goals :

==Human rights education at schools==

Several schools offer human rights education as part of their curriculum, for example linked subjects like History, Politics and Citizenship, but there are also specialised courses, such as Human Rights offered as part of the International Bacclaureate Diploma programme for high school students.

IB Human Rights is an academic subject containing units on:

* The theory of human rights
* The practise of human rights
* Contemporary human rights issues

In order to pass the course students are required to study for two years, take a final examination and produce a coursework.

As part of their diploma programme, students may also choose to write their Extended Essay on Human Rights. This is a 4000 word research paper focusing on human rights.

The IB Human Rights course was originally authored by Joni Mäkivirta, the developer of [[Cognitive Emotional Pedagogy]]. Part of the 2002 version of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110411121849/http://www.hrea.org/erc/Library/pre-service/syllabus-ibo02.pdf IB Human Rights] syllabus is at the Global Human Rights Education (HREA) website. Only part of the syllabus is available at the HREA website for copyright reasons.

The complete IB Human Rights syllabus that contains more details, including the assessment criteria, as well as the guide for the Human Rights Extended Essay can be acquired from [http://www.ibo.org the International Baccalaureate Organisation].

Some cities in the world have adopted a municipal law to stimulate successfully the HRE in the public schools, as the example of the Municipal Plan of HRE of the city of São Paulo (Decreto Nº 57.503, DE 6 DE Dezembro de 2016), in Brazil [http://portaledh.educapx.com/].

==Human rights education models==
1.	'''Values and awareness'''
The Values and Awareness Model focuses on transmitting “basic knowledge of human rights issues and to foster its integration into public values” based on its philosophical-historical approach. This model is what people commonly think of when human rights are concerned with the target audience being the general public with topics including global human rights and more cultural based matters.

2.	'''Accountability'''
The Accountability Model is associated with the legal and political approach to human rights in which the learners which the model targets are already involved via professional roles.  The model is incorporated by means of training and networking, covering topics such as court cases, codes of ethics, and how to deal with the media.

3.	'''Transformational''' 
This model of education focuses on the psychological and sociological aspects of human rights.  The topics towards which this model is effective are those including vulnerable populations and people with personal experiences effected by the topic, such as women and minorities. The model aims to empower the individual, such as those victims of abuse and trauma. The model is geared towards recognizing the abuse of human rights but is also committed to preventing these abuses.&lt;ref&gt;"Understanding what we do: emerging models for human rights education by Felisa Tibbitts International Review of Education volume 48, numbers 3-4, pgs 159-171"&lt;/ref&gt;

(eds) (2005) ''Oxford Dictionary of Scientific Quotations.'' Oxford University Press. 21:9.&lt;/ref&gt; They adduce that for this purpose schools must encourage ethical behavior and personal responsibility. In order to achieve these goals schools must respect human rights in school by allowing students the three great freedoms—freedom of choice, freedom of action and freedom to bear the results of action—that constitute personal responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, D.

{{Other uses|Incontinence (disambiguation)}}
'''Incontinence''' ("a want of continence or self-restraint") is often used by philosophers to translate the Greek term [[Akrasia]] (ἀκρασία). Used to refer to a lacking in moderation or self-control, especially related to sexual desire,&lt;ref&gt;dictionary.com – [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/incontinence incontinence]&lt;/ref&gt; incontinence may also be called '''wantonness'''.

==Aristotle==
[[Aristotle]] devoted book VII of the [[Nicomachean Ethics]] to the discussion of continence and incontinence, having previously linked the latter both to [[Spendthrift|prodigality]] in its effects, and to those dominated by irrational feeling in its failure to obey knowledge of the good:&lt;ref&gt;J. A. K. Thompson trans, ''The Ethics of Aristotle'' (1976) pp. 142, 66, and 89&lt;/ref&gt; a case of knowing [[virtue]], but not having habituated it to control [[Passion (emotion)|passion]]. 

Aristotle considered one could be incontinent with respect to money or temper or glory, but that its core relation was to bodily enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 235-9&lt;/ref&gt; Its causes could be weakness of will, or an impetuous refusal to think.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he did not consider it a vice, because it is not so much a product of moral choice, but instead, a failure to act on one's better knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 244-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later developments==

For Augustine, incontinence was not so much a problem of knowledge (knowing but not acting) but of the [[Will (philosophy)|will]]: he considered it a matter of everyday experience that men incontinently choose lesser over greater goods.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Mitcham, ''Thinking Through Technology'' (1994) p. 263-4&lt;/ref&gt;

In the structural division of [[Inferno (Dante)|Dante's ''Inferno'']], incontinence is the sin punished in the second through fifth circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Durling|first1=Robert M.|last2=Martinez|first2=Ronald L.|page=178|title=Inferno|series=The Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri|volume=1|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1996|isbn=9780195087444}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mutual incontinence of lust was for Dante the lightest of the deadly sins,&lt;ref&gt;Dante, p. 101-2&lt;/ref&gt; even if its lack of self-control would open the road to deeper layers of Hell.

Akrasia appeared later as a character in Spenser's [[The Faerie Queene]], representing the incontinence of lust, followed in the next canto by a study of that of anger;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Spenser]], ''The Fairie Queen'' (1978) p. lxiv&lt;/ref&gt; and as late as [[Jane Austen]] the [[sensibility]] of such figures as [[Marianne Dashwood]] would be treated as a form of (spiritual) incontinence.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Harman, ''Jane's Fame'' (2007) p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

With the triumph of [[Romanticism]], however, the incontinent choice of feeling over reason became increasingly valorised in Western culture.&lt;ref&gt;Mitcham, p. 265–56&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Blake|Blake]] wrote that "those who restrain desire, do so because theirs is weak enough to be restrained".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in M. H. Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (1971) p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraged by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], there was a rise of what [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] would describe as "an ''abandon'' (ακρατεια)...a state of mind in which [[antinomianism]] is accepted – consciously or unconsciously, in theory or in practice – as a substitute for creativeness".&lt;ref&gt;Arnold J. Toynbee, ''[[A Study of History]]'' (1939) v5 p. 377 and p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;

A peak of such acrasia was perhaps reached in the 1960s cult of letting it all hang out – of breakdown, acting out and emotional self-indulgence and drama.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Diski, ''The Sixties'' (2009) p. 120-1&lt;/ref&gt; Partly in reaction, the proponents of [[emotional intelligence]] would look back to Aristotle in the search for impulse control and [[Gratification|delayed gratification]]&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1996) pp. 80–83 and p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; – to his dictum that "a person is called continent or incontinent according as his reason is or is not in control".&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], '''intelligibility''' is what can be comprehended by the [[human mind]] in contrast to sense perception.  The intelligible method is thought thinking itself, or the human mind reflecting on itself.  [[Plato]] referred to the intelligible realm of [[mathematics]], [[Intelligible form|forms]], [[first principles]], logical [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], and the [[dialectical method]].  The intelligible realm of thought thinking about thought does not necessarily require any visual images, sensual impressions, and material causes for the contents of mind.  [[René Descartes|Descartes]] referred to this method of thought thinking about itself, without the possible illusions of the senses.  [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] made similar claims about [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] knowledge.  A priori knowledge is claimed to be independent of the content of experience.

==Usage==
The [[object (philosophy)|objects]] or concepts that have intelligibility may be called '''intelligible'''. Some possible examples are [[number]]s and the logical [[law of non-contradiction]].

There may be a distinction between everything that is intelligible and everything that is visible, called the ''intelligible world'' and the ''visible world'' in e.g. the [[analogy of the divided line]] as written by [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.cua.edu/hoffmann/courses/201_1068/Plato&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] is generally regarded as being only partially intelligible. The Absolute is the idea of an unconditional [[reality]] which [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcend]]s limited, conditional, everyday [[existence]]. It is sometimes used as a term for [[God]] or the [[Divine]]. Other similar concepts are [[The One (Neoplatonism)|The One]] and [[First Cause]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11372">'''Katharine "Kay" Bullitt''' (born February, 22, 1925) is a [[Seattle]] education reformer, civil rights activist and philanthropist. Bullitt was instrumental in the [[desegregation]] of [[Seattle Public Schools|Seattle public schools]].

== Early years ==
Katharine "Kay" Bullitt was born in 1925 in Boston and was raised in Arlington, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/bullitt.htm|title=Kay Bullitt|website=depts.washington.edu|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother had a long career as dean of women at Colorado College before marrying in her late 30's and having three daughters. Kay was the middle child between Marion ("Barney") and Margaret ("Margie").&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parentmap.com/article/2014-superheroes-for-washington-families?page=2|title=2014 Superheroes for Washington Families - ParentMap|website=www.parentmap.com|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullitt attended the [[Shady Hill School]] in Cambridge.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title="I thought if I'd stayed in Cambridge ... I'd have been active in teaching and Democratic politics"|date=1969-12-31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhOvhAdbvgU&amp;list=PLrnclw6j_Mi8aqQrNHZqfoqBZ3Jrvg5Un&amp;index=2|accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullitt's interest in civic projects began early and focused on education and peace. She attended [[Radcliffe College]] which both her mother and sister had attended.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title=Kay Bullitt: Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project (Segment 1)|date=2016-11-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bXmKE0b0Yo&amp;list=PLrnclw6j_Mi8aqQrNHZqfoqBZ3Jrvg5Un&amp;index=1|accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in college, Bullitt worked in a community center in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] which primarily serviced African-American children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Kay's sister had written her thesis on the difference between African-American students from [[Barbados]] and the South.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Kay's own senior thesis was on the role of Federal Government in Education.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  During World War II, Bullitt spent a summer at the Hampton Institute in Virginia as part of an interracial farm project. Bullitt was also active with the Massachusetts Fair Employment Practice.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

After the end of World War II, Bullitt worked in Germany for two summers.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title=Bullitt describes her role in several efforts to desegregate Seattle public schools in the 1960s|date=2016-09-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WdYGdet0uU&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLrnclw6j_Mi8aqQrNHZqfoqBZ3Jrvg5Un|accessdate=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After college, Bullitt taught at the Shady Hill School in Cambridge which she had attended as a child.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She taught the fourth grade there for five years. Inspired by the ability that she had observed in the young African-Americans she had worked with, Bullitt decided to take a trip across the country to observe what education and work experience was like for children. In her wanderings, Bullitt came to Seattle and decided to stay in 1951.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Desegregation in Seattle ==
In the 1960s, Bullitt hosted an integrated day camp at her home on Capitol Hill.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title="It showed all during that time when there was such difficulty in the schools..."|date=2016-09-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DK8NBm6E54&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLrnclw6j_Mi8aqQrNHZqfoqBZ3Jrvg5Un|accessdate=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Bullitt said that the camp was "self-serving," as she had three older (step-)children and three under six, all with different interests.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; She recruited teachers and counselors from the [[League of Women Voters]] and The Little School in Seattle. From after the World's Fair in 1962 through the early seventies, the camp was integrated and grew to host 100 children and 35 teenagers running it.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Also during this time in the 1960s, Bullitt began work in Seattle to integrate schools through voluntary transfer.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Her children were going to [[Lowell Elementary School (Seattle, Washington)|Lowell Elementary School]] in the Capitol Hill neighborhood and they began a partnership with Madrona School, a primarily African-American school in Seattle, and had about 50 children going between the schools. Bullitt also started the Voluntary Instruction Program (VIP) which brought in volunteers to teach subjects in small groups, starting with Madrona, but then went to other Central District schools.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The program disappeared when they were unable to convince the district to fund a directorship position.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Bullitt briefly headed a program called School Affiliation Service which was based on her visits to Germany after World War II. Bullitt wanted to have people come from the South to see how the integration in Seattle was working.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This program eventually evolved into  the Coalition for Quality Integrated Education (CQIE) in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/school-integration-memories-hit-home/|title=School-Integration memories hit home|date=2012-06-13|newspaper=The Seattle Times|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title=In the early 1970s Bullitt started a volunteer organization to work for school desegregation|date=2016-09-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hup_BX8_kus&amp;index=6&amp;list=PLrnclw6j_Mi8aqQrNHZqfoqBZ3Jrvg5Un|accessdate=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wawona and Other Civic Projects ==
In 1963 after reading an article in the local paper about the ''[[Wawona (schooner)|Wawona]]'', an historic schooner, Bullitt began efforts to save and restore the ship.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/historic-schooner-wawona-heads-for-demise/|title=Historic schooner Wawona heads for demise|date=2009-03-05|newspaper=The Seattle Times|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 165 foot-long ship was launched in 1897 and was initially used to haul lumber up and down the Pacific Coast.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The schooner also served as a fishing schooner in the Bering Sea and was a military barge during Word War II.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After 46 years and numerous fundraising and volunteer efforts, it was determined it would be too costly to restore and they were unable to secure permanent moorage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ship, which was profiled in ''Shipbuilders, Sea Captains and Fishermen'' by Joe Follansbee, was dismantled in 2009, with portions being saved for the Seattle Museum of History &amp; Industry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Bullitt was instrumental in founding several Civic and community projects in Seattle. She helped found [[Bumbershoot]], an annual international music and arts festival in Seattle, which takes place every Labor Day Weekend at the [[Seattle Center]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/pacific-nw-magazine/kay-bullitt/|title=Kay Bullitt|date=2005-08-26|newspaper=The Seattle Times|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the seventies, Bullitt helped found a savings and loan bank for women, called Sound Savings &amp; Loan. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title="We were able to help a lot of women get credit and get loans, and the banks started hiring women"|date=2016-09-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4l3Ita5MNA&amp;index=9&amp;list=PLrnclw6j_Mi8aqQrNHZqfoqBZ3Jrvg5Un|accessdate=2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullitt helped restore Pioneer Square.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 1982 Bullitt, then a director of the Municipal League, helped organize Target Seattle, which was a week-long [[symposium]] on the dangers of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/File/3123|title=Target Seattle symposium discusses nuclear war and doomsday for a week beginning on September 24, 1982. - HistoryLink.org|website=www.historylink.org|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title=In the 1980s, Bullitt helped organize a weeklong anti-nuclear protest in Seattle|date=2016-09-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv0qucXK0G8&amp;list=PLrnclw6j_Mi8aqQrNHZqfoqBZ3Jrvg5Un&amp;index=11|accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers included [[Louis Harris]], [[David Brower]], [[Jonas Salk|Dr. Jonas Salk]], Dr. [[John E.

Every year for 60 years, on Wednesday evenings in July, Bullitt hosted a picnic for family and friends at her Capitol Hill home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Bullitt also hosted Seattle's Middle East Peace Camp for Children for a number of years on the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2007/08/18/peace-camp-stresses-unity-diversity|title=Peace Camp Stresses Unity in Diversity|last=|first=|date=|work=Common Dreams|access-date=2017-03-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|title="As {{sic|hide=y|Ghandi}} said, 'If you want real peace, start with the children.'"|date=2016-09-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvDhtLaq0no&amp;list=PLrnclw6j_Mi8aqQrNHZqfoqBZ3Jrvg5Un&amp;index=12|accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullitt, with her former late husband, Stimson Bullitt, donated the property to the city to be a park after her death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Democracy Workshop|title=Steinbrueck Kickoff - Kay Bullitt - 05-05-2013|date=2013-05-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mRbtUMp4yI|accessdate=2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullitt has many awards including a United Nations Human Rights Prize.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Personal ==
In 1954, Bullitt was married to Stimson Bullitt, son of [[Dorothy Stimson Bullitt]], the founder of [[KING Broadcasting Company]]. Their marriage lasted for 25 years, ending in divorce in 1979. Stimson Bullitt was the President of KING Broadcasting in Seattle from 1962-72. He was also an attorney, author, judge and outdoorsman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/civic-leader-charles-stimson-bullitt-ran-king-tv-and-helped-shape-seattle/|title=Civic leader Stimson Bullitt ran KING-TV and helped shape Seattle|date=2009-04-21|newspaper=The Seattle Times|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her step-children, Ashley, Scott -- who changed his name to Fred Nemo, and Jill, Kay and Stim had three more children: Dorothy, Ben (who preceded her in death in Nov, 1981), and Margaret.

[[File:Gravitation space source.svg|thumb|200px|Induced spacetime curvature]]

In [[physics]], '''Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime''' govern the dynamics of the [[electromagnetic field]] in [[curvature|curved]] [[spacetime]] (where the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] may not be the [[Minkowski metric]]) or where one uses an arbitrary (not necessarily [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]]) coordinate system. These equations can be viewed as a generalization of the [[Maxwell's equations#In vacuum|vacuum Maxwell's equations]] which are normally formulated in the [[local coordinates]] of [[flat spacetime]]. But because [[general relativity]] dictates that the presence of electromagnetic fields (or [[energy]]/[[matter]] in general) induce curvature in spacetime,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/h224886u7651v774/ | doi=10.1007/BF00762342 | bibcode=1984GReGr..16..495H | volume=16 | title=The significance of curvature in general relativity | year=1984 | journal=General Relativity and Gravitation | pages=495–500 | last1 = Hall | first1 = G. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell's equations in flat spacetime should be viewed as a convenient approximation.

When working in the presence of bulk matter, it is preferable to distinguish between free and bound electric charges. Without that distinction, the vacuum Maxwell's equations are called the "microscopic" Maxwell's equations. When the distinction is made, they are called the macroscopic Maxwell's equations.

The electromagnetic field also admits a coordinate-independent geometric description, and Maxwell's equations expressed in terms of these geometric objects are the same in any spacetime, curved or not.  Also, the same modifications are made to the equations of flat [[Minkowski space]] when using local coordinates that are not Cartesian. For example, the equations in this article can be used to write Maxwell's equations in [[spherical coordinates]]. For these reasons, it may be useful to think of Maxwell's equations in Minkowski space as a [[special case]], rather than Maxwell's equations in curved spacetimes as a generalization.

==Summary==

In [[general relativity]], the [[metric (general relativity)|metric]], ''g''&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt;, is no longer a constant (like η&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt; as in [[metric tensor (general relativity)#Examples|Examples of metric tensor]]) but can vary in space and time, and the equations of electromagnetism in a vacuum become:
:&lt;math&gt;F_{\alpha \beta} \, = \, \partial_{\alpha} A_{\beta} \, - \, \partial_{\beta} A_{\alpha} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\mu\nu} \, = \, \frac{1}{\mu_{0}} \, g^{\mu\alpha} \, F_{\alpha\beta} \, g^{\beta\nu} \, \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;J^{\mu} \, = \, \partial_\nu \mathcal{D}^{\mu \nu} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f_\mu \, = \, F_{\mu\nu} \, J^\nu \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; is the density of the [[Lorentz force]], ''g''&lt;sup&gt;αβ&lt;/sup&gt; is the reciprocal of the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] ''g''&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''g'' is the [[determinant]] of the metric tensor. Notice that ''A''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt; are (ordinary) tensors while &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{D}^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;, ''J''&lt;sup&gt;ν&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; are [[tensor density|tensor ''densities'']] of weight +1. Despite the use of [[partial derivative]]s, these equations are invariant under arbitrary curvilinear coordinate transformations. Thus if one replaced the partial derivatives with [[covariant derivative]]s, the extra terms thereby introduced would cancel out.  (Cf. [[manifest covariance#Example]].)

==The electromagnetic potential==

The [[Electromagnetic four-potential|electromagnetic potential]] is a covariant vector, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; which is the undefined primitive of electromagnetism. As a covariant vector, its rule for transforming from one coordinate system to another is
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{A}_{\beta}(\bar{x}) = \frac{\partial x^{\gamma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} A_{\gamma}(x)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Electromagnetic field==
The [[Electromagnetic tensor|electromagnetic field]] is a covariant [[antisymmetric tensor]] of degree 2 which can be defined in terms of the electromagnetic potential by

:&lt;math&gt;F_{\alpha \beta} = \partial_{\alpha} A_{\beta} - \partial_{\beta} A_{\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

To see that this equation is invariant, we transform the coordinates (as described in the [[classical treatment of tensors]])

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\bar{F}_{\alpha \beta} &amp;= \frac{\partial \bar{A}_{\beta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} - \frac{\partial \bar{A}_{\alpha}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} \\[6pt]
&amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \left( \frac{\partial x^{\gamma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} A_{\gamma} \right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} \left( \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} A_{\delta} \right) \\[6pt]
&amp;= \frac{\partial^2 x^{\gamma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha} \partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} A_{\gamma} + \frac{\partial x^{\gamma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} \frac{\partial A_{\gamma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} - \frac{\partial^2 x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta} \partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} A_{\delta} - \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial A_{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} \\[6pt]
&amp;= \frac{\partial x^{\gamma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial A_{\gamma}}{\partial x^{\delta}} - \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial x^{\gamma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} \frac{\partial A_{\delta}}{\partial x^{\gamma}} \\[6pt]
&amp;= \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial x^{\gamma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} \left( \frac{\partial A_{\gamma}}{\partial x^{\delta}} - \frac{\partial A_{\delta}}{\partial x^{\gamma}} \right) \\[6pt]
&amp;= \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial x^{\gamma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} F_{\delta \gamma}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This definition implies that the electromagnetic field satisfies 

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\lambda F_{\mu \nu} + \partial _\mu F_{\nu \lambda} + \partial_\nu F_{\lambda \mu} = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;

which incorporates [[Faraday's law of induction]] and [[Gauss's law for magnetism]]. This is seen by

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\lambda F_{\mu \nu} + \partial _\mu F_{\nu \lambda} + \partial_\nu F_{\lambda \mu} = \partial_\lambda \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\lambda \partial_\nu A_\mu + \partial_\mu \partial_\nu A_\lambda - \partial_\mu \partial_\lambda A_\nu + \partial_\nu \partial_\lambda A_\mu - \partial_\nu \partial_\mu A_\lambda = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Although there appear to be 64 equations in Faraday–Gauss, it actually reduces to just four independent equations. Using the antisymmetry of the electromagnetic field one can either reduce to an identity (0 = 0) or render redundant all the equations except for those with ''λ'', ''μ'', ''ν'' being either 1, 2, 3 or 2, 3, 0 or 3, 0, 1 or 0, 1, 2.

The Faraday–Gauss equation is sometimes written

:&lt;math&gt;F_{[\mu \nu; \lambda]} = F_{[\mu \nu, \lambda]} = \frac{1}{6} \left( \partial_\lambda F_{\mu \nu} + \partial _\mu F_{\nu \lambda} + \partial_\nu F_{\lambda \mu} - \partial_\lambda F_{\nu \mu} - \partial _\mu F_{\lambda \nu} - \partial_\nu F_{\mu \lambda} \right) = \frac{1}{3} \left( \partial_\lambda F_{\mu \nu} + \partial _\mu F_{\nu \lambda} + \partial_\nu F_{\lambda \mu} \right) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where a semicolon indicates a covariant derivative, a comma indicates a partial derivative, and square brackets indicate anti-symmetrization (see [[Ricci calculus]] for the notation). The covariant derivative of the electromagnetic field is

:&lt;math&gt;F_{\alpha \beta; \gamma} = F_{\alpha \beta, \gamma} - {\Gamma^{\mu}}_{\alpha \gamma} F_{\mu \beta} - {\Gamma^{\mu}}_{\beta \gamma} F_{\alpha \mu},&lt;/math&gt;

where Γ''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;βγ&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Christoffel symbol]], which is symmetric in its lower indices.

==Electromagnetic displacement==
The [[electric displacement field]], '''D''' and the [[auxiliary magnetic field]], '''H''' form an antisymmetric contravariant rank 2 [[tensor density]] of weight +1. In a vacuum, this is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\mu \nu} \, = \, \frac{1}{\mu_{0}} \, g^{\mu \alpha} \, F_{\alpha \beta} \, g^{\beta \nu} \, \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is the only place where the metric (and thus gravity) enters into the theory of electromagnetism. Furthermore, the equation is invariant under a change of scale, that is, multiplying the metric by a constant has no effect on this equation. Consequently, gravity can only affect electromagnetism by changing the [[speed of light]] relative to the global coordinate system being used. Light is only deflected by gravity because it is slower when near to massive bodies. So it is as if gravity increased the index of refraction of space near massive bodies.

More generally, in materials where the [[magnetization]]&amp;ndash;[[electric polarization|polarization]] tensor is non-zero, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^{\mu \nu} \, = \, \frac{1}{\mu_{0}} \, g^{\mu \alpha} \, F_{\alpha \beta} \, g^{\beta \nu} \, \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} \, - \, \mathcal{M}^{\mu \nu} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The transformation law for electromagnetic displacement is
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathcal{D}}^{\mu \nu} \, = \, \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \, \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\beta}} \, \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \, \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] \,&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Jacobian determinant]] is used. If the magnetization-polarization tensor is used, it has the same transformation law as the electromagnetic displacement.

==Electric current==
The electric current is the divergence of the electromagnetic displacement. In a vacuum,

:&lt;math&gt;J^{\mu} = \partial_{\nu} \mathcal{D}^{\mu \nu}.&lt;/math&gt;

If magnetization-polarization is used, then this just gives the free portion of the current

:&lt;math&gt;J^{\mu}_{\text{free}} = \partial_{\nu} \mathcal{D}^{\mu \nu}.&lt;/math&gt;

This incorporates [[Ampere's Law]] and [[Gauss's Law]].

In either case, the fact that the electromagnetic displacement is antisymmetric implies that the electric current is automatically conserved

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_{\mu} J^{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} \partial_{\nu} \mathcal{D}^{\mu \nu} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

because the partial derivatives [[Commutative property|commute]].

The Ampere-Gauss definition of the electric current is not sufficient to determine its value because the electromagnetic potential (from which it was ultimately derived) has not been given a value. Instead, the usual procedure is to equate the electric current to some expression in terms of other fields, mainly the electron and proton, and then solve for the electromagnetic displacement, electromagnetic field, and electromagnetic potential.

The electric current is a contravariant vector density, and as such it transforms as follows

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{J}^{\mu} = \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} J^{\alpha} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right].&lt;/math&gt;

Verification of this transformation law

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\bar{J}^{\mu} &amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}} \left( \bar{\mathcal{D}}^{\mu \nu} \right) \\[6pt]

 &amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}} \left( \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\beta}} \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] \right) \\[6pt]

 &amp;= \frac{\partial^2 \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu} \partial x^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\beta}} \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial^2 \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu} \partial x^{\beta}} \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\beta}} \frac{\partial \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\beta}} \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] \\[6pt]

&amp;= \frac{\partial^2 \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\beta} \partial x^{\alpha}} \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial^2 \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu} \partial x^{\beta}} \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta}}{\partial x^{\beta}} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\beta}} \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}}{\partial x^{\sigma}} \frac{\partial^2 x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu} \partial \bar{x}^{\rho}}\\[6pt]

&amp; = 0+ \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial^2 \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu} \partial x^{\beta}} \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} J^{\alpha} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}}{\partial x^{\sigma}} \frac{\partial^2 x^{\sigma}}{\partial x^{\beta} \partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \\[6pt]

&amp; = \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} J^{\alpha} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} \mathcal{D}^{\alpha \beta} \det \left[ \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right] \left( \frac{\partial^2 \bar{x}^{\nu}} {\partial \bar{x}^{\nu} \partial x^{\beta}} + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}}{\partial x^{\sigma}} \frac{\partial^2 x^{\sigma}}{\partial x^{\beta} \partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

So all that remains is to show that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu} \partial x^{\beta}} + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}}{\partial x^{\sigma}} \frac{\partial^2 x^{\sigma}}{\partial x^{\beta} \partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

which is a version of a known theorem (see [[Inverse functions and differentiation#Higher derivatives]]).

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\partial^2 \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu} \partial x^{\beta}} + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\rho}}{\partial x^{\sigma}} \frac{\partial^2 x^{\sigma}}{\partial x^{\beta} \partial \bar{x}^{\rho}} &amp;= \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}} 
\frac{\partial^2 \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\sigma} \partial x^{\beta}} + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\sigma}} \frac{\partial^2 x^{\sigma}}{\partial x^{\beta} \partial \bar{x}^{\nu}} \\[6pt]

&amp; = \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}} \frac{\partial^2 \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\beta} \partial x^{\sigma}} + \frac{\partial^2 x^{\sigma}}{\partial x^{\beta} \partial \bar{x}^{\nu}} \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\sigma}} \\[6pt]

&amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\beta}} \left( \frac{\partial x^{\sigma}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}} \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\sigma}} \right) \\[6pt]

&amp; = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\beta}} \left( \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\nu}} \right) \\[6pt]

&amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\beta}} \left( \mathbf{4} \right) \\[6pt]

&amp;= 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Lorentz force density==
The density of the [[Lorentz force]] is a covariant vector density given by

:&lt;math&gt;f_{\mu} = F_{\mu \nu} J^{\nu} .&lt;/math&gt;

The force on a test particle subject only to gravity and electromagnetism is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d p_{\alpha}}{dt} = \Gamma^{\beta}_{\alpha \gamma} p_{\beta} \frac{d x^{\gamma}}{dt} + q F_{\alpha \gamma} \frac{d x^{\gamma}}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''p&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the linear 4-momentum of the particle, ''t'' is any time coordinate parameterizing the world line of the particle, Γ&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;αγ&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Christoffel symbol]] (gravitational force field), and ''q'' is the electric charge of the particle.

This equation is invariant under a change in the time coordinate; just multiply by &lt;math&gt;d t/d \bar{t}&lt;/math&gt; and use the [[chain rule]]. It is also invariant under a change in the ''x'' coordinate system.

Using the transformation law for the Christoffel symbol

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\Gamma}^{\beta}_{\alpha \gamma} = \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}}{\partial x^{\epsilon}} \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial x^{\zeta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\gamma}} \Gamma^{\epsilon}_{\delta \zeta} + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}}{\partial x^{\eta}} \frac{\partial^2 x^{\eta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha} \partial \bar{x}^{\gamma}} &lt;/math&gt;

we get

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d \bar{p}_{\alpha}}{dt} - \bar{\Gamma}^{\beta}_{\alpha \gamma} \bar{p}_{\beta} &amp; \frac{d\bar{x}^{\gamma}}{dt} - q \bar{F}_{\alpha \gamma} \frac{d \bar{x}^{\gamma}}{dt} = \\[6pt]

&amp; = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} p_{\delta} \right) - \left( \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}}{\partial x^{\theta}}  \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \frac{\partial x^{\iota}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\gamma}} \Gamma^{\theta}_{\delta \iota} + \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}}{\partial x^{\eta}} \frac{\partial^2 x^{\eta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha} \partial \bar{x}^{\gamma}} \right) \frac{\partial x^{\epsilon}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} p_{\epsilon} \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\gamma}}{\partial x^{\zeta}} \frac{d x^{\zeta}}{dt} - q \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} F_{\delta \zeta} \frac{d x^{\zeta}}{dt} \\[6pt]

&amp;= \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \left( \frac{d p_{\delta}}{dt} - \Gamma^{\epsilon}_{\delta \zeta} p_{\epsilon} \frac{d x^{\zeta}}{dt} - q F_{\delta \zeta} \frac{d x^{\zeta}}{dt} \right) + \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \right) p_{\delta} - \left( \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}}{\partial x^{\eta}} 
\frac{\partial^2 x^{\eta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha} \partial \bar{x}^{\gamma}} \right) \frac{\partial x^{\epsilon}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\beta}} p_{\epsilon} \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{\gamma}}{\partial x^{\zeta}} \frac{d x^{\zeta}}{dt} \\[6pt]

&amp; = 0 + \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial x^{\delta}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha}} \right) p_{\delta} - \frac{\partial^2 x^{\epsilon}}{\partial \bar{x}^{\alpha} \partial \bar{x}^{\gamma}} p_{\epsilon} \frac{d \bar{x}^{\gamma}}{dt} = 0

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Lagrangian==
In a vacuum, the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian density]] for classical electrodynamics (in joules/meter&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) is a scalar [[tensor density|density]]

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} \, = \, - \frac{1}{4 \mu_0} \, F_{\alpha \beta} \, F^{\alpha \beta} \, \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} \, + \, A_{\alpha} \, J^{\alpha} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;F^{\alpha \beta} = g^{\alpha \gamma} F_{\gamma \delta} g^{\delta \beta} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The four-current should be understood as an abbreviation of many terms expressing the electric currents of other charged fields in terms of their variables.

If we separate free currents from bound currents, the Lagrangian becomes
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} \, = \, - \frac{1}{4 \mu_0} \, F_{\alpha \beta} \, F^{\alpha \beta} \, \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} \, + \,A_{\alpha} \, J^{\alpha}_{\text{free}} \, + \, \frac12 \, F_{\alpha \beta} \, \mathcal{M}^{\alpha \beta} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Electromagnetic stress–energy tensor==
{{main|Electromagnetic stress–energy tensor}}

As part of the source term in the [[Einstein field equations]], the electromagnetic [[stress–energy tensor]] is a covariant symmetric tensor

:&lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\nu} = - \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left ( F_{\mu \alpha} g^{\alpha \beta} F_{\beta \nu} - \frac{1}{4} g_{\mu \nu} F_{\sigma \alpha} g^{\alpha \beta} F_{\beta \rho} g^{\rho \sigma} \right  ) &lt;/math&gt;

using a metric of signature (−,+,+,+). If using the metric with signature (+,−,−,−), the expression for &lt;math&gt;T_{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt; will have opposite sign. The stress–energy tensor is trace-free

:&lt;math&gt;T_{\mu \nu} g^{\mu \nu} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

because electromagnetism propagates at the [[invariant speed]].

In the expression for the conservation of energy and linear momentum, the electromagnetic stress–energy tensor is best represented as a mixed tensor density

:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{T}_{\mu}^{\nu} = T_{\mu \gamma} g^{\gamma \nu} \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c}.&lt;/math&gt;

From the equations above, one can show that

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak{T}_{\mu}^{\nu}}_{; \nu} + f_{\mu} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the semicolon indicates a [[covariant derivative]].

This can be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;- {\mathfrak{T}_{\mu}^{\nu}}_{, \nu} = - \Gamma^{\sigma}_{\mu \nu} \mathfrak{T}_{\sigma}^{\nu} + f_{\mu} &lt;/math&gt;

which says that the decrease in the electromagnetic energy is the same as the work done by the electromagnetic field on the gravitational field plus the work done on matter (via the Lorentz force), and similarly the rate of decrease in the electromagnetic linear momentum is the electromagnetic force exerted on the gravitational field plus the Lorentz force exerted on matter.

Derivation of conservation law

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
{\mathfrak{T}_{\mu}^{\nu}}_{; \nu} + f_{\mu} &amp;= -\frac{1}{\mu_0} \left ( F_{\mu \alpha ; \nu} g^{\alpha \beta} F_{\beta \gamma} g^{\gamma \nu} + F_{\mu \alpha} g^{\alpha \beta} F_{\beta \gamma ; \nu} g^{\gamma \nu} - \frac12 \delta_{\mu}^{\nu} F_{\sigma \alpha ; \nu} g^{\alpha \beta} F_{\beta \rho} g^{\rho \sigma} \right ) \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} + \frac{1}{\mu_{0}} F_{\mu \alpha} g^{\alpha \beta} F_{\beta \gamma ; \nu} g^{\gamma \nu} \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} \\[6pt]

&amp;= - \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left ( F_{\mu \alpha ; \nu} F^{\alpha \nu} - \frac12 F_{\sigma \alpha ; \mu} F^{\alpha \sigma} \right ) \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} \\[6pt]

&amp;= - \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left  ( \left (- F_{\nu \mu ; \alpha} - F_{\alpha \nu ; \mu} \right ) F^{\alpha \nu} - \frac12 F_{\sigma \alpha ; \mu} F^{\alpha \sigma} \right ) \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} \\[6pt]

&amp;= - \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left ( F_{\mu \nu ; \alpha} F^{\alpha \nu} - F_{\alpha \nu ; \mu} F^{\alpha \nu} + \frac12 F_{\sigma \alpha ; \mu} F^{\sigma \alpha} \right  ) \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} \\[6pt]

&amp;= - \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left ( F_{\mu \alpha ; \nu} F^{\nu \alpha} - \frac12 F_{\alpha \nu ; \mu} F^{\alpha \nu} \right ) \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c} \\[6pt]

&amp;= - \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left (- F_{\mu \alpha ; \nu} F^{\alpha \nu} + \frac12 F_{\sigma \alpha ; \mu} F^{\alpha \sigma} \right ) \frac{\sqrt{-g}}{c}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which is zero because it is the negative of itself (see four lines above).

==Electromagnetic wave equation==
The [[nonhomogeneous electromagnetic wave equation]] in terms of the field tensor is modified from the [[Formulation of Maxwell's equations in special relativity|special relativity form]] to

:&lt;math&gt; \Box F_{ab} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  F_{ab;}{}^d{}_d = \, -2 R_{acbd} F^{cd} + R_{ae}F^e{}_b - R_{be}F^e{}_a + J_{a;b} - J_{b;a} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''R&lt;sub&gt;acbd&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the covariant form of the [[Riemann tensor]] and &lt;math&gt; \Box &lt;/math&gt; is a generalization of the [[d'Alembertian]] operator for covariant derivatives. Using

:&lt;math&gt;  \Box A^{a} = {{A^{a; }}^{b}}_{ b} &lt;/math&gt;

Maxwell's source equations can be written in terms of the [[Four-potential|4-potential]] [ref 2, p.&amp;nbsp;569] as,

:&lt;math&gt;  \Box A^{a}  - {A^{b;a}}_{ b} = - \mu_0 J^{ a } &lt;/math&gt;

or, assuming the generalization of the [[Lorenz gauge]] in curved spacetime

:&lt;math&gt;  {A^{ a  }}_{ ; a } = 0 \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  \Box A^{a}  = - \mu_0 J^{ a }  + {R^{ a }}_{ b } A^{ b } &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;  R_{ a b }  \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  {R^{ s }}_{ a s b } &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Ricci curvature tensor]].

This the same form of the wave equation as in flat spacetime, except that the derivatives are replaced by covariant derivatives and there is an additional term proportional to the curvature. The wave equation in this form also bears some resemblance to the Lorentz force in curved spacetime where ''A&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;'' plays the role of the 4-position.

== Nonlinearity of Maxwell's equations in a dynamic spacetime ==

When Maxwell's equations are treated in a [[background independent]] manner, that is, when the spacetime metric is taken to be a dynamical variable dependent on the electromagnetic field, then the electromagnetic wave equation and Maxwell's equations are nonlinear. This can be seen by noting that the curvature tensor depends on the stress–energy tensor through the [[Einstein field equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;   G_{ab} =  \frac{8 \pi G} {c^4}   T_{ab}    &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;  {G}_{a  b} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\        {R}_{a b} - {1 \over 2} {R} g_{a b}   &lt;/math&gt;
is the [[Einstein tensor]], ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]], ''g&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[metric tensor]], and ''R'' ([[scalar curvature]]) is the trace of the Ricci curvature tensor. The stress–energy tensor is composed of the stress-energy from particles, but also stress-energy from the electromagnetic field. This generates the nonlinearity.

== Geometric formulation ==

In the differential geometric formulation of the electromagnetic field, the antisymmetric Faraday tensor can be considered as the [[differential form#Applications in physics|Faraday 2-form]] '''F'''.  In this view, one of Maxwell's two equations is  d'''F'''= '''0''', where ''d'' is the [[exterior derivative]] operator. This equation is completely coordinate and metric independent and says that the electro-magnetic flux through a closed two dimensional surface in space time is topological, more precisely, depends only on its  [[homology class]] (a generalization of the integral form of Gauss law and Maxwell-Faraday equation as the homology class in Minkowski space is automatically 0). By the [[Poincaré lemma]], this equation implies, (at least locally) that there exists a 1-form '''A''' satisfying '''F''' = d '''A'''. The other Maxwell equation is d * '''F''' = '''J'''.
In this context, '''J''' is the [[differential form#Applications in physics|current 3-form]] (or even more precise, twisted three form), the asterisk * denotes the [[Hodge star]] operator, and d is the exterior derivative operator. The dependence of Maxwell's equation on the metric of spacetime lies in the Hodge star operator * on two forms, which is [[conformally invariant]].  Written this way, Maxwell's equation is the same in any space time, manifestly coordinate invariant, and convenient to use (even in Minkowski space or Euclidean space and time especially with curvilinear coordinates).

An even more geometric interpretation is that the Faraday two form '''F''' is (up to a factor i) the [[curvature 2-form]] &lt;math&gt;F(\nabla)&lt;/math&gt; of a ''U''(1)-[[Connection (vector bundle)|connection]] &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; on a [[principal bundle|principal ''U''(1)-bundle]] whose sections represent charged fields. The connection is much like the vector potential since every connection can be written as &lt;math&gt;\nabla = \nabla_0 + iA&lt;/math&gt; for a "base" connection &lt;math&gt;\nabla_0&lt;/math&gt; and '''F''' = '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + d '''A'''. In this view, the Maxwell "equation", d '''F'''= '''0''', is a mathematical identity known as the [[Bianchi identity]]. The equation  d * '''F''' = '''J''' is the only equation with any physical content in this formulation. This point of view is particularly natural when considering charged fields or quantum mechanics. It can be interpreted as saying that, much like gravity can be understood as being the result of the necessity of a connection to parallel transport vectors at different points, electromagnetic phenomena, or more subtle quantum effects like the [[Aharanov-Bohm effect]], can be understood as a result from the necessity of a connection to parallel transport charged fields or wave sections at different points. In fact, just as the Riemann tensor is the [[holonomy]] of the Levi Civita connection along an infinitesimal closed curve, the curvature of the connection is the holonomy of the U(1)-connection.

In [[U.S. antitrust law]], the phrase "'''merger doctrine'''" is used to broadly describe the approaches that courts have taken to address [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]] between [[corporation]]s which might tend to reduce [[Competition (economics)|competition]] and raise prices. More specifically, courts tend to make separate discussions of a ''horizontal merger doctrine'' (where direct competitors merge) and ''vertical merger doctrine'' (where a company merges with its own suppliers and distributors, cutting them off from supplying or distributing to competitors).

In the law of [[real property]], the '''merger doctrine''' stands for the proposition that the [[contract]] for the conveyance of property merges into the [[deed]] of conveyance; therefore, any guarantees made in the contract that are not reflected in the deed are extinguished when the deed is conveyed to the buyer of the property.

The merger doctrine traditionally applies only to covenants of title; covenants relating to the physical condition of the property (say, a promise that the furnace is in good working order) will not merge, and will not extinguish. The parties may by contract abrogate the doctrine and provide that some or all terms of the contract survive the closing and delivery of the deed.{{citation needed|date = January 2015}}

Merger also refers to the doctrine whereby "a [[fee simple]] estate, once fragmented into present and future interests, can thereafter be reconstituted. 'Merger is the absorption of a lesser estate by a greater estate, and takes place when two distinct estates of greater and lesser rank meet in the same person or class of persons at the same time without any intermediate estate.'
"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chase|first1=Edward, &amp; Julia Forrester|title=Property Law|date=2010|publisher=LexisNexis|isbn=978-08205-7094-5|pages=262–63|edition=2d}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a merger doctrine extinguishes an easement by necessity to a landlocked piece of property once that property is sold to one of the adjoining owners, thus extinguishing the necessity. The lack of any property interest removes the necessity and the easement.

==Blink of an eye==
[[File:MBED Top Level Ontology.jpg|thumb|right|This [[NASA]]-generated chart expresses a framework for modeling non-military space systems architectures; but it could be construed as a military taxonomy -- modeling military space systems architectures.&lt;ref&gt;Shames, Peter and Joseph Skipper. (2006). [https://web.archive.org/web/20090227132305/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/39851/1/06-0876.pdf  "Toward a Framework for Modeling Space Systems Architectures."] NASA, JPL.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Military theorist [[Carl von Clausewitz]] stressed the significance of grasping the fundamentals of any situation in the "blink of an eye" (''[[coup d'œil]]'').  In a military context, the astute tactician can immediately grasp a range of implications and can begin to anticipate plausible and appropriate courses of action.&lt;ref&gt;Calusewitz, Carl. (1982). [https://books.google.com/books?id=_La4qTgECD0C&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=clausewitz+coup+d%27oeil&amp;source=web&amp;ots=8UCKTI28o4&amp;sig=0ntr9cQoagmpsJVuulXii533H8U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result  ''On War,'' p. 141;] [http://www.greenchameleon.com/gc/blog_detail/defining_taxonomy/ "Defining 'Taxonomy',"] Straights Knowledge website.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clauzewitz' conceptual "blink" represents a tentative [[ontology]] which organizes a set of concepts within a [[Domain of discourse|domain]].

A conventional military taxonomy might be an hierarchical set of classifications for a given set of objects; and the progress of reasoning is developed from the general to the more specific. In such taxonomic [[Model (abstract)|schema]], a conflative term is always a [[polyseme]].&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Joseph L. (1988). [https://books.google.com/books?id=PEY0U3umLRkC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=conflation&amp;client=firefox-a  ''The Science of Linguistics in the Art of Translation: Some Tools from Linguistics for the Analysis and Practice of Translation,'' p. 112.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, a less conventional approach might employ an open-ended contextual military taxonomy—a taxonomy holding only with respect to a specific context; and the progress of reasoning is developed form the specific to the more general.&lt;ref&gt;Grossi, Davide, [[Frank Dignum]] and John-Jules Charles Meyer. (2005). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/9yj2lfa5cy67c78m/fulltext.pdf?page=1  "Contextual Taxonomies" in ''Computational Logic in Multi-Agent Systems,'' pp. 33-51].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptive paradigm==
A taxonomy of terms to describe various types of military operations is fundamentally affected by the way all elements are defined and addressed—not unlike [[framing (social sciences)|framing]].

In terms of a specific military operation, a taxonomic approach based on differentiation and categorization of the entities participating would produce results which were quite different from an approach based on functional objective of an operation (such as peacekeeping, disaster relief, or counter-terrorism). An incidental advantage which flows from give-and-take in refining taxonomic terms more accurately and efficiently becomes more than a worthwhile objective in terms of anticipated outcomes or results. In today's nontraditional operations, the discussion about fundamentals also generates greater precision in how the defense and security community understands and discusses integrated operations.&lt;ref&gt;Downie, Richard D. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0KNN/is_38/ai_n15631260/pg_3?tag=artBody;col1 "Defining integrated operations,"] ''Joint Force Quarterly'' (Washington, D.C.). July, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hyūga class helicopter destroyer===
Military taxonomy in Japan is circumscribed by Japan's pacifist post-war constitution.  For example, this affects classification of the [[Hyūga class helicopter destroyer|''Hyūga'' class helicopter carriers]], which are ships of the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] (JMSDF).&lt;ref name="globalsecurity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/ddh-x.htm |title=16DDH "13,500 ton" ton Class |work=Global Security |accessdate=2008-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616174940/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/ddh-x.htm |archivedate=June 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of [[helicopter carrier]] was formally identified as a helicopter [[destroyer]] (DDH) to comply with explicit constitutional limitations written in [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[  "Japan's Largest 'Helicopter Carrier' Commissioned Amid Concerns," Kyodo News International. March 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two ships of this class, the JS ''Hyūga'' and the JS ''Ise''  resemble a light [[aircraft carrier]] or [[amphibious assault ship]] such as the [[Marina Militare Italiana|Italian Navy]]'s 13,850-ton [[Giuseppe Garibaldi (551)|''Giuseppe Garibaldi'']], the [[Spanish Navy]]'s 17,000-ton [[Principe de Asturias (R11)|''Principe de Asturias'']] or the [[Royal Navy]]'s 21,000-ton [[Invincible class aircraft carrier|''Invincible''-class carriers]].&lt;ref name="Hutchison2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htnavai/articles/20070825.aspx|title=Japan's Secret Aircraft Carriers|last=Hutchison |first=Harold C. |date=2007-08-25|work=StrategyPage|accessdate=2008-07-13}}; {{ja}} [http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=cae_1188504476 JMSDF's new carrier, launch video.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary, JS ''Hyūga'' is the "first Japanese aircraft carrier built since WWII;"&lt;ref&gt;PBS/WNET, NYC: [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/episodes/japans-about-face/introduction/746/ "Japan's About-Face: The military's shifting role in post-war society."] July 8, 2008; Teslik, Lee Hudson. [http://www.cfr.org/publication/10439/japan_and_its_military.html "Backgrounder; Japan and Its Military,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125200934/http://www.cfr.org/publication/10439/japan_and_its_military.html |date=2010-01-25 }} ''Council on Foreign Relations.'' April 13, 2006; Hsiao, Russell. [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/JA08Ad01.html "China navy floats three-carrier plan,"] ''Asia Times'' (Hong Kong). January 8, 2008; [http://informationdissemination.blogspot.com/search?q=hyuga "Meet Japan's New Destroyer - Updated,"] Information Dissemination (blog). August 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but this label is controversial.  A taxonomic label of "aircraft carrier" is legally proscribed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avionews.com/index.php?corpo=see_news_home.php&amp;news_id=1101427&amp;pagina_chiamante=corpo%3Dindex.php  "Japan Commissioned Its Biggest Helicopter Carrier,"] ''AvionNews'' (World Aeronautical Press Agency). March 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each ship in this class has attracted media and Diet attention because of its resemblance to an aircraft carrier.  Until the 1970s, US Navy taxonomy categorized large-scale flattops as "attack aircraft carriers" and small flattops as "antisubmarine aircraft carriers." In Japan, the constitutional prohibition against having "attack" aircraft carries has been construed to encompass small aircraft carriers but not helicopter carriers.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity"/&gt;

A uniquely Japanese taxonomic template is applied to these ships and to their missions, which are limited to "[[military operations other than war]]" (MOOTW).&lt;ref name="globalsecurity"/&gt;

==Strategic paradigm==
A number of military strategies can be parsed using a taxonomy model.  The comparative theoretical framework might posit a range of criteria, e.g., the character of envisaged political goals, the type of military strategy preferred, and the scope of forces engaged; and this template suggests discrete modes of force.  The taxonomy-model analysis suggests a useful depiction of the spectrum of the use of military force in a political context.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Stuart A. and  Efraim Inbar. [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a782379359~db=all~order=page  "A taxonomy of Israel's use of military force,"] ''Journal Comparative Strategy,'' Vol. 10, No. 2 (April 1991), pp. 121 - 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parsing terrorism===
In the 21st century, the ambit of a subset taxonomy of terrorism would include terms related to terrorists, terrorist groups, terrorist attacks, weapons, venues, and characteristics of terrorists and terrorist groups.&lt;ref name="cycorp2"/&gt;

==Limitations==
Taxonomies offer useful, but incomplete means of structuring information.&lt;ref name="e-mapsys1"&gt;Electronic Mapping Systems: [http://www.e-mapsys.com/Taxonomy1.htm  taxonomy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxonomies are a necessary but not sufficient condition for adequate evaluation of a given data set. While the taxonomic categorizations and sub-categorizations do enhance understanding, it may be significant that the lack of detail in describing objects or elements creates room for ambiguity.&lt;ref name="e-mapsys1"/&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''multiplication table''' (sometimes, less formally, a '''times table''') is a [[mathematical table]] used to define a [[multiplication]] [[binary operation|operation]] for an algebraic system.

The [[decimal]] multiplication table was traditionally taught as an essential part of elementary arithmetic around the world, as it lays the foundation for arithmetic operations with base-ten numbers. Many educators believe it is necessary to memorize the table up to 9 × 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=For the Learning of Mathematics|volume=1|issue=1|year=1980|title=The Multiplication Table: To Be Memorized or Mastered!|first=John|last=Trivett|pages=21–25|jstor= 40247697}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Qinghuajian, Suan Biao.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The [[Tsinghua Bamboo Slips]], Chinese [[Warring States]] era decimal multiplication table of 305&amp;nbsp;BC]]
The oldest known multiplication tables were used by the [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]] about 4000 years ago.&lt;ref name=Qiu/&gt; However, they used a base of 60.&lt;ref name=Qiu&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jane Qiu | title = Ancient times table hidden in Chinese bamboo strips | journal = Nature News | date = January 7, 2014 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2014.14482 | url = http://www.nature.com/news/ancient-times-table-hidden-in-chinese-bamboo-strips-1.14482}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known tables using a base of 10 are the [[Chinese mathematics|Chinese]] [[Tsinghua Bamboo Slips#Decimal multiplication table|decimal multiplication table on bamboo strips]] dating to about 305&amp;nbsp;BC, during China's [[Warring States]] period.&lt;ref name=Qiu/&gt;

[[File:PSM V26 D467 Table of pythagoras on slats.jpg|thumb|right|180px|"Table of Pythagoras" on [[Napier's bones]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Page:Popular Science Monthly Volume 26.djvu/467]]&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
The multiplication table is sometimes attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician [[Pythagoras]] (570–495&amp;nbsp;BC). It is also called the Table of Pythagoras in many languages (for example French, Italian and at one point even Russian), sometimes in English.&lt;ref&gt;for example in [https://books.google.com/books?id=TBBKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=%22table+of+pythagoras%22+-Montessori&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TaXIEXCAic&amp;sig=KiblQIMaPnnwRp-R0eW6CSEQUUk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IltFTezaDJH2sgatovGnDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22table%20of%20pythagoras%22%20-Montessori&amp;f=false ''An Elementary Treatise on Arithmetic'' by [[John Farrar (scientist)|John Farrar]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Greco-Roman]] mathematician [[Nichomachus]] (60–120&amp;nbsp;AD), a follower of [[Neopythagoreanism]], included a multiplication table in his ''[[Introduction to Arithmetic]]'', whereas the oldest surviving [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] multiplication table is on a wax tablet dated to the 1st century AD and currently housed in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;David E. Smith (1958), ''History of Mathematics, Volume I: General Survey of the History of Elementary Mathematics''. New York: Dover Publications (a reprint of the 1951 publication), {{isbn|0-486-20429-4}}, pp. 58, 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 493&amp;nbsp;AD, [[Victorius of Aquitaine]] wrote a 98-column multiplication table which gave (in [[Roman numerals]]) the product of every number from 2 to 50 times and the rows were "a list of numbers starting with one thousand, descending by hundreds to one hundred, then descending by tens to ten, then by ones to one, and then the fractions down to 1/144."&lt;ref&gt;David W. Maher and John F. Makowski. "Literary evidence for Roman arithmetic with fractions". ''Classical Philology'', 96/4 (October 2001), p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1820 book ''The Philosophy of Arithmetic'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leslie |first=John |year=1820 |title=The Philosophy of Arithmetic; Exhibiting a Progressive View of the Theory and Practice of Calculation, with Tables for the Multiplication of Numbers as Far as One Thousand |publisher=Abernethy &amp; Walker |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; mathematician [[John Leslie (physicist)|John Leslie]] published a multiplication table up to 99 × 99, which allows numbers to be multiplied in pairs of digits at a time.  Leslie also recommended that young pupils memorize the multiplication table up to 25 × 25. The illustration below shows a table up to 12 × 12, which is a size commonly used in schools.

The traditional rote learning of multiplication was based on memorization of columns in the table, in a form like
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
&lt;poem&gt;
   1 × 10 = 10
   2 × 10 = 20
   3 × 10 = 30
   4 × 10 = 40
   5 × 10 = 50
   6 × 10 = 60
   7 × 10 = 70
   8 × 10 = 80
   9 × 10 = 90
&lt;/poem&gt;
{{div col end}}

This form of writing the multiplication table in columns with complete number sentences is still used in some countries, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina,{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} instead of the modern grid above.

==Patterns in the tables==
There is a pattern in the multiplication table that can help people to memorize the table more easily. It uses the figures below:
&lt;!--

Figure 1 is used for multiples of 1, 3, 7, and 9. Figure 2 is used for the multiples of 2, 4, 6, and 8. These patterns can be used to memorize the multiples of any number from 0 to 10, except 5. As you would start on the number you are multiplying, when you multiply by 0, you stay on 0 (0 is external and so the arrows have no effect on 0, otherwise 0 is used as a link to create a perpetual cycle). The pattern also works with multiples of 10, by starting at 1 and simply adding 0, giving you 10, then just apply every number in the pattern to the "tens" unit as you would normally do as usual to the "ones" unit.

[[File:Multiplication_mnemonic_7.svg|thumb|120px|Using the mnemonic to recall multiples of 7]]
For example, to recall all the multiples of 7:

# Look at the 7 in the first picture and follow the arrow.
# The next number in the direction of the arrow is 4. So think of the next number after 7 that ends with 4, which is 14.
# The next number in the direction of the arrow is 1. So think of the next number after 14 that ends with 1, which is 21.
# After coming to the top of this column, start with the bottom of the next column, and travel in the same direction. The number is 8. So think of the next number after 21 that ends with 8, which is 28.
# Proceed in the same way until the last number, 3, corresponding to 63.
# Next, use the 0 at the bottom. It corresponds to 70.
# Then, start again with the 7.  This time it will correspond to 77.
# Continue like this.

==In abstract algebra==
Tables can also define binary operations on [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[field (mathematics)|field]]s, [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, and other [[Abstract algebra|algebraic systems]]. In such contexts they can be called [[Cayley table]]s. Here are the addition and multiplication tables for the [[finite field]] '''Z&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

For every natural number ''n'', there are also addition and multiplication tables for the ring '''Z&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

==Chinese multiplication table==
{{Main|Chinese multiplication table}}
The Chinese multiplication table consists of eighty-one sentences with four or five Chinese characters per sentence, making it easy for children to learn by heart. A shorter version of the table consists of only forty-five sentences, as terms such as "nine eights beget seventy-two" are identical to "eight nines beget seventy-two" so there is no need to learn them twice.

==Standards-based mathematics reform in the US==
In 1989, the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] (NCTM) developed new standards which were based on the belief that all students should learn higher-order thinking skills, and which recommended reduced emphasis on the teaching of traditional methods that relied on rote memorization, such as multiplication tables. Widely adopted texts such as [[Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space]] (widely known as [[Technical Education Research Centers|TERC]] after its producer, Technical Education Research Centers) omitted aids such as multiplication tables in early editions. NCTM made it clear in their 2006 [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics#Curriculum Focal Points|Focal Points]] that basic mathematics facts must be learned, though there is no consensus on whether rote memorization is the best method.

In [[multilinear algebra]], a '''multivector''', sometimes called '''Clifford number''',&lt;ref&gt;John Snygg (2012), ''A New Approach to Differential Geometry Using Clifford’s Geometric Algebra'', Birkhäuser, p.5 §2.12&lt;/ref&gt; is an element of the [[exterior algebra]] {{math|Λ(''V'')}} of a [[vector space]] {{mvar|V}}. This algebra is [[graded algebra|graded]], [[associative algebra|associative]] and [[alternating algebra|alternating]], and consists of [[linear combination]]s of '''simple''' {{math|''k''}}-vectors (also known as '''decomposable''' {{math|''k''}}-vectors or [[Blade (geometry)|{{math|''k''}}-blades]]) of the form
:&lt;math&gt; v_1\wedge\cdots\wedge v_k,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;v_1, \ldots, v_k&lt;/math&gt; are in {{mvar|V}}.

"Multivector" may mean either ''homogeneous'' elements (all terms of the linear combination have the same grade or degree {{math|''k''}}, that is are the product of the same number {{math|''k''}} of vectors), which are referred to as '''{{math|''k''}}-vectors''' or '''{{math|''p''}}-vectors''',&lt;ref&gt;Élie Cartan, ''The theory of spinors'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=AEZ1h7Cg3cwC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=p-vector+multivectors p. 16], considers only homogeneous vectors, particularly simple ones, referring to them as "multivectors" (collectively) or ''p''-vectors (specifically).&lt;/ref&gt; or may allow sums of terms in different degrees.

In [[differential geometry]], a '''{{math|''p''}}-vector''' is the antisymmetric [[tensor]] obtained by taking [[linear combination]]s of the [[wedge product]] of {{math|''p''}} [[tangent vector]]s, for some integer {{math|''p'' ≥ 0}}. It is the [[Dual space|dual]] concept to a [[p-form|{{math|''p''}}-form]].

For {{math|1=''p'' = 0, 1, 2}} and {{math|3}}, these are often called respectively ''[[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s'', ''vectors'', ''[[bivector]]s'' and ''trivectors''; they are respectively dual to [[0-form]]s, [[1-form]]s, [[2-form]]s and 3-forms.&lt;ref name="Ławrynowicz"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wedge product==
{{Main|Exterior algebra}}

The wedge product operation used to construct multivectors is linear, associative and alternating, which reflect the properties of the determinant. This means for vectors '''u''', '''v''' and '''w''' in a vector space ''V'' and for scalars ''α'', ''β'', the wedge product has the properties,

* Linear:  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}\wedge(\alpha\mathbf{v}+\beta\mathbf{w})=\alpha\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}+\beta\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{w};&lt;/math&gt;
* Associative:  &lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v})\wedge\mathbf{w}=\mathbf{u}\wedge(\mathbf{v}\wedge\mathbf{w})=\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}\wedge\mathbf{w};&lt;/math&gt;
* Alternating:  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}=-\mathbf{v}\wedge\mathbf{u}, \quad\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{u}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The product of ''p'' vectors is called a grade ''p'' multivector, or a ''p''-vector.  The maximum grade of a multivector is the dimension of the vector space ''V''.

The linearity of the wedge product allows a multivector to be defined as the linear combination of basis multivectors.  There are &lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''n''|b=''p''}}&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt; basis ''p''-vectors in an ''n''-dimensional vector space.&lt;ref name="Flanders"&gt;H. Flanders, ''Differential Forms with Applications to the Physical Sciences, Academic Press, New York, NY, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

==Area and volume==
The ''p''-vector obtained from the wedge product of ''p'' separate vectors in an ''n''-dimensional space has components that define the projected {{nowrap|(''p'' − 1)}}-volumes of the ''p''-[[Parallelepiped#Parallelotope|parallelotope]] spanned by the vectors.  The square root of the sum of the squares of these components defines the volume of the ''p''-parallelotope.&lt;ref name="Flanders"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Shilov, ''Linear Algebra'', (trans. R. A. Silverman), Dover Publications, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following examples show that a bivector in two dimensions measures the area of a parallelogram, and the magnitude of a bivector in three dimensions also measures the area of a parallelogram.  Similarly, a three-vector in three dimensions measures the volume of a parallelepiped.

It is easy to check that the magnitude of a three-vector in four dimensions measures the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by these vectors.

===Multivectors in R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;===
Properties of multivectors can be seen by considering the two dimensional vector space {{nowrap|1=''V'' = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Let the basis vectors be '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, so '''u''' and '''v''' are given by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}=u_1\mathbf{e}_1+u_2\mathbf{e}_2,\quad \mathbf{v}=v_1\mathbf{e}_1+v_2\mathbf{e}_2,&lt;/math&gt;

and the multivector {{nowrap|'''u''' ∧ '''v'''}}, also called a bivector, is computed to be

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v} =\begin{vmatrix} u_1 &amp; v_1 \\ u_2 &amp; v_2\end{vmatrix} \mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2.&lt;/math&gt;

The vertical bars denote the determinant of the matrix, which is the area of the parallelogram spanned by the vectors '''u''' and '''v'''.  The magnitude of {{nowrap|'''u''' ∧ '''v'''}} is the area of this parallelogram.  Notice that because ''V'' has dimension two the basis bivector {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the only multivector in Λ''V''.

The relationship between the magnitude of a multivector and the area or volume spanned by the vectors is an important feature in all dimensions.  Furthermore, the linear functional version of a multivector that computes this volume is known as a differential form.

===Multivectors in R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;===
More features of multivectors can be seen by considering the three dimensional vector space {{nowrap|1=''V'' = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  In this case, let the basis vectors be '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, so '''u''', '''v''' and '''w''' are given by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}=u_1\mathbf{e}_1+u_2\mathbf{e}_2 +u_3\mathbf{e}_3 ,\quad \mathbf{v}=v_1\mathbf{e}_1+v_2\mathbf{e}_2+v_3\mathbf{e}_3, \quad \mathbf{w}=w_1\mathbf{e}_1+w_2\mathbf{e}_2+w_3\mathbf{e}_3,&lt;/math&gt;

and the bivector {{nowrap|'''u''' ∧ '''v'''}} is computed to be

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v} =\begin{vmatrix} u_2 &amp; v_2 \\ u_3 &amp; v_3\end{vmatrix} \mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_3 + \begin{vmatrix} u_1 &amp; v_1 \\ u_3 &amp; v_3\end{vmatrix} \mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_3 +\begin{vmatrix} u_1 &amp; v_1 \\ u_2 &amp; v_2\end{vmatrix} \mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2.&lt;/math&gt;

The components of this bivector are the same as the components of the cross product.  The magnitude of this bivector is the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.

This shows that the magnitude of the bivector {{nowrap|'''u''' ∧ '''v'''}} is the area of the parallelogram spanned by the vectors '''u''' and '''v''' as it lies in the three-dimensional space ''V''.  The components of the bivector are the projected areas of the parallelogram on each of the three coordinate planes.

Notice that because ''V'' has dimension three, there is one basis three-vector in Λ''V''.  Compute the three-vector
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}\wedge\mathbf{w}=\begin{vmatrix} u_1 &amp; v_1 &amp;w_1\\ u_2 &amp; v_2&amp; w_2\\u_3&amp;v_3&amp;w_3\end{vmatrix} \mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_3. &lt;/math&gt;
This shows that the magnitude of the three-vector {{nowrap|'''u''' ∧ '''v''' ∧ '''w'''}} is the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the three vectors '''u''', '''v''' and '''w'''.

In higher-dimensional spaces, the component three-vectors are projections of the volume of a parallelepiped onto the coordinate three-spaces, and the magnitude of the three-vector is the volume of the parallelepiped as it sits in the higher-dimensional space.

==Grassmann coordinates==
In this section, we consider multivectors on a [[projective space]] ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, which provide a convenient set of coordinates for lines, planes and hyperplanes that have properties similar to the homogeneous coordinates of points, called [[Grassmann coordinates]].&lt;ref&gt;W. V. D. Hodge and D. Pedoe, Methods of Algebraic Geometry, Vol. 1, Cambridge Univ. Press, 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

Points in a real projective space ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; are defined to be lines through the origin of the vector space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;.  For example, the projective plane ''P''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the set of lines through the origin of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  Thus, multivectors defined on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; can be viewed as multivectors on ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

A convenient way to view a multivector on ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is to examine it in an [[affine space|affine component]] of ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the intersection of the lines through the origin of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; with a selected hyperplane, such as {{nowrap|1=H: ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1}}.  Lines through the origin of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; intersect the plane {{nowrap|1=E: ''z'' = 1}} to define an affine version of the projective plane that only lacks the points {{nowrap|1=''z'' = 0}}, called the points at infinity.

===Multivectors on ''P''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;===
Points in the affine component {{nowrap|1=E: ''z'' = 1}} of the projective plane have coordinates {{nowrap|1='''x''' = (''x'', ''y'', 1)}}.  A linear combination of two points {{nowrap|1='''p''' = (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1)}} and {{nowrap|1='''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1)}} defines a plane in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; that intersects E in the line joining '''p''' and '''q'''.  The multivector {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q'''}} defines a parallelogram in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; given by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} \wedge \mathbf{q} =(p_2 - q_2)\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_3 + (p_1- q_1) \mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_3 +(p_1 q_2-  q_1 p_2)\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2.&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that substitution of {{nowrap|''α'''''p''' + ''β'''''q'''}} for '''p''' multiplies this multivector by a constant.  Therefore, the components of {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q'''}} are homogeneous coordinates for the plane through the origin of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

The set of points {{nowrap|1='''x''' = (''x'', ''y'', 1)}} on the line through '''p''' and '''q''' is the intersection of the plane defined by {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q'''}}  with the plane {{nowrap|1=E: ''z'' = 1}}.  These points satisfy {{nowrap|1='''x''' ∧ '''p''' ∧ '''q''' = 0}}, that is,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{p} \wedge \mathbf{q} = (x\mathbf{e}_1+y\mathbf{e}_2+\mathbf{e}_3)\wedge \big( (p_2 - q_2)\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_3 + (p_1- q_1) \mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_3 +(p_1 q_2-  q_1 p_2)\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2\big)=0,&lt;/math&gt;

which simplifies to the equation of a line

:&lt;math&gt;  \lambda:  x(p_2 - q_2) + y(p_1- q_1)+ (p_1 q_2- q_1 p_2)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is satisfied by points {{nowrap|1='''x''' = ''α'''''p''' + ''β'''''q'''}} for real values of α and β.

The three components of {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q'''}} that define the line ''λ'' are called the [[Grassmann coordinates]] of the line.  Because three homogeneous coordinates define both a point and a line, the geometry of points is said to be dual to the geometry of lines in the projective plane.  This is called the [[duality (projective geometry)|principle of duality]].

===Multivectors on ''P''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;===
Three dimensional projective space, ''P''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; consists of all lines through the origin of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.  Let the three dimensional hyperplane, {{nowrap|1=H: ''w'' = 1}}, be the affine component of projective space defined by the points {{nowrap|1='''x''' = (''x'', ''y'', ''z'', 1)}}.  The multivector {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q''' ∧ '''r'''}} defines a parallelepiped in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}\wedge\mathbf{q}\wedge\mathbf{r}=\begin{vmatrix} p_2 &amp; q_2 &amp;r_2\\ p_3 &amp; q_3&amp; r_3\\1&amp;1&amp;1\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_3\wedge\mathbf{e}_4 + \begin{vmatrix} p_1 &amp; q_1 &amp;r_1\\ p_3 &amp; q_3&amp; r_3\\1&amp;1&amp;1\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_3\wedge\mathbf{e}_4 + \begin{vmatrix} p_1 &amp; q_1 &amp;r_1\\ p_2 &amp; q_2&amp; r_2\\1&amp;1&amp;1\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_4 + \begin{vmatrix} p_1 &amp; q_1 &amp;r_1\\ p_2 &amp; q_2&amp; r_2\\ p_3 &amp; q_3&amp; r_3\end{vmatrix} \mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_3. &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that substitution of {{nowrap|α'''p''' + β'''q''' + γ'''r'''}} for '''p''' multiplies this multivector by a constant.  Therefore, the components of {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q''' ∧ '''r'''}}  are homogeneous coordinates for the 3-space through the origin of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

A plane in the affine component {{nowrap|1=H: ''w'' = 1}} is the set of points {{nowrap|1='''x''' = (''x'', ''y'', ''z'', 1)}} in the intersection of H with the 3-space defined by {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q''' ∧ '''r'''}}.  These points satisfy {{nowrap|1='''x''' ∧ '''p''' ∧ '''q''' ∧ '''r''' = 0}}, that is,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{p} \wedge \mathbf{q}\wedge\mathbf{r} = (x\mathbf{e}_1+y\mathbf{e}_2+z\mathbf{e}_3 +\mathbf{e}_4)\wedge \mathbf{p}\wedge\mathbf{q}\wedge\mathbf{r} = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;

which simplifies to the equation of a plane

:&lt;math&gt;  \lambda:  x\begin{vmatrix} p_2 &amp; q_2 &amp;r_2\\ p_3 &amp; q_3&amp; r_3\\1&amp;1&amp;1\end{vmatrix} + y \begin{vmatrix} p_1 &amp; q_1 &amp;r_1\\ p_3 &amp; q_3&amp; r_3\\1&amp;1&amp;1\end{vmatrix}+ z\begin{vmatrix} p_1 &amp; q_1 &amp;r_1\\ p_2 &amp; q_2&amp; r_2\\1&amp;1&amp;1\end{vmatrix}+  \begin{vmatrix} p_1 &amp; q_1 &amp;r_1\\ p_2 &amp; q_2&amp; r_2\\ p_3 &amp; q_3&amp; r_3\end{vmatrix} =0.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is satisfied by points {{nowrap|1='''x''' = ''α'''''p''' + ''β'''''q''' + ''γ'''''r'''}} for real values of ''α'', ''β'' and ''γ''.

The four components of {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q''' ∧ '''r'''}} that define the plane ''λ'' are called the [[Grassmann coordinates]] of the plane.  Because four homogeneous coordinates define both a point and a plane in projective space, the geometry of points is dual to the geometry of planes.

'''A line as the join of two points:''' In projective space the line ''λ'' through two points '''p''' and '''q''' can be viewed as the intersection of the affine space {{nowrap|1=H: ''w'' = 1}} with the plane {{nowrap|1='''x''' = ''α'''''p''' + ''β'''''q'''}}  in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.  The multivector {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q'''}} provides homogeneous coordinates for the line

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda:  \mathbf{p} \wedge \mathbf{q} = (p_1\mathbf{e}_1+p_2\mathbf{e}_2+p_3\mathbf{e}_3 +\mathbf{e}_4)\wedge  (q_1\mathbf{e}_1+q_2\mathbf{e}_2+q_3\mathbf{e}_3 +\mathbf{e}_4),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\qquad =\begin{vmatrix} p_1 &amp; q_1\\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_4 + \begin{vmatrix} p_2 &amp; q_2\\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_4 + \begin{vmatrix} p_3 &amp; q_3\\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_3\wedge\mathbf{e}_4+ \begin{vmatrix} p_2 &amp; q_2\\ p_3 &amp; q_3 \end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_3+\begin{vmatrix} p_3 &amp; q_3\\ p_1 &amp; q_1 \end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_3\wedge\mathbf{e}_1+\begin{vmatrix} p_1 &amp; q_1\\ p_2 &amp; q_2\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2.&lt;/math&gt;
These are known as the [[Plücker coordinates]] of the line, though they are also an example of Grassmann coordinates.

'''A line as the intersection of two planes:'''  A line ''μ'' in projective space can also be defined as the set of points '''x''' that form the intersection of two planes ''π'' and ''ρ'' defined by grade three multivectors, so the points '''x''' are the solutions to the linear equations

:&lt;math&gt;  \mu: \mathbf{x}\wedge \pi = 0, \mathbf{x}\wedge \rho = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

In order to obtain the Plucker coordinates of the line ''μ'', map the multivectors ''π'' and ''ρ'' to their dual point coordinates using the [[Hodge star operator]],&lt;ref name="Flanders"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_1 = {\star}(\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_3 \wedge\mathbf{e}_4), -\mathbf{e}_2 = {\star}(\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_3 \wedge\mathbf{e}_4), \mathbf{e}_3 = {\star}(\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2 \wedge\mathbf{e}_4), -\mathbf{e}_4 = {\star}(\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2 \wedge\mathbf{e}_3),&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt; {\star}\pi = \pi_1\mathbf{e}_1 + \pi_2\mathbf{e}_2 + \pi_3\mathbf{e}_3 + \pi_4\mathbf{e}_4, \quad {\star}\rho = \rho_1\mathbf{e}_1 + \rho_2\mathbf{e}_2 + \rho_3\mathbf{e}_3 + \rho_4\mathbf{e}_4 .&lt;/math&gt;

So, the Plücker coordinates of the line ''μ'' are given by

:&lt;math&gt; \mu: ({\star}\pi)\wedge({\star}\rho) =\begin{vmatrix} \pi_1 &amp; \rho_1\\ \pi_4 &amp; \rho_4 \end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_4 + \begin{vmatrix} \pi_2 &amp; \rho_2\\ \pi_4 &amp; \rho_4 \end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_4 + \begin{vmatrix} \pi_3 &amp; \rho_3\\ \pi_4 &amp; \rho_4\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_3\wedge\mathbf{e}_4+ \begin{vmatrix}  \pi_2 &amp; \rho_2\\ \pi_3 &amp; \rho_3\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_3+\begin{vmatrix}  \pi_3 &amp; \rho_3\\ \pi_1 &amp; \rho_1\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_3\wedge\mathbf{e}_1+\begin{vmatrix}  \pi_1 &amp; \rho_1\\ \pi_2 &amp; \rho_2\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2.&lt;/math&gt;

Because the six homogeneous coordinates of a line can be obtained from the join of two points or the intersection of two planes, the line is said to be self dual in projective space.

==Clifford product==
[[William Kingdon Clifford|W. K. Clifford]] combined multivectors with the [[inner product]] defined on the vector space, in order to obtain a general construction for hypercomplex numbers that includes the usual complex numbers and Hamilton's [[quaternion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;W. K. Clifford, "Preliminary sketch of bi-quaternions," Proc. London Math. Soc. Vol. 4 (1873) pp. 381-395&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. K. Clifford, ''Mathematical Papers'', (ed. R. Tucker), London: Macmillan, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clifford product between two vectors '''u''' and '''v''' is linear and associative like the wedge product, and has the additional property that the multivector '''uv''' is coupled to the inner product {{nowrap|'''u''' · '''v'''}} by Clifford's relation,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{v}\mathbf{u} = 2\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}.&lt;/math&gt;

Clifford's relation preserves the alternating property for the product of vectors that are perpendicular.  This can be seen for the orthogonal unit vectors {{nowrap|1='''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n''}} in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  Clifford's relation yields

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_i\mathbf{e}_j + \mathbf{e}_j\mathbf{e}_i = 2\mathbf{e}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_j = 0, &lt;/math&gt;

therefore the basis vectors are alternating,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_i\mathbf{e}_j = -  \mathbf{e}_j\mathbf{e}_i, \quad i\neq j = 1, \ldots, n.&lt;/math&gt;

In contrast to the wedge product, the Clifford product of a vector with itself is no longer zero.  To see this compute the product,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_i\mathbf{e}_i +  \mathbf{e}_i\mathbf{e}_i = 2 \mathbf{e}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_i = 2,&lt;/math&gt;

which yields

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_i\mathbf{e}_i = 1,\quad i=1,\ldots, n.&lt;/math&gt;

The set of multivectors constructed using Clifford's product yields an associative algebra known as a [[Clifford algebra]].  Inner products with different properties can be used to construct different Clifford algebras.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=glOqQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22J.+M.+McCarthy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_QoMToDvMcfd0QGFh-mvDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDsQ6wEwAg J.

Bottema and B. Roth, ''Theoretical Kinematics'', North Holland Publ. Co., 1979]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometric algebra==
{{See also|Blade (geometry)}}

Multivectors play a central role in the mathematical formulation of physics known as geometric algebra.  The term ''geometric algebra'' was used by E. Artin for matrix methods in projective geometry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009Z61B58/ref=rdr_ext_tmb  E. Artin, ''Geometric algebra, Interscience Publ., 1957]&lt;/ref&gt; It was D. Hestenes who used ''[[geometric algebra]]'' to describe the application of Clifford algebras to classical mechanics,&lt;ref&gt;D. Hestenes, New Foundations for Classical Mechanics, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  This formulation was expanded to ''geometric calculus'' by D. Hestenes and G. Sobczyk,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Clifford-Algebra-Geometric-Calculus-Mathematics/dp/9027725616/ref=sr_1_10?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396272483&amp;sr=1-10&amp;keywords=geometric+algebra D. Hestenes and G. Sobczyk, Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus: A Unified Language for Mathematics and Physics, Springer Verlag, 1987]&lt;/ref&gt; who provided new terminology for a variety of features in this application of Clifford algebra to physics. C. Doran and A. Lasenby show that Hestene's geometric algebra provides a convenient formulation for modern physics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Geometric-Algebra-Physicists-Chris-Doran/dp/0521715954/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_z C. Doran and A. Lasenby, Geometric Algebra for Physicists, Cambridge Univ. Press, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometric algebra]], a multivector is defined to be the sum of different-grade [[blade (geometry)|''k''-blades]], such as the summation of a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]], a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], and a ''2''-vector.&lt;ref name= Rodrigues&gt;{{cite book |title=Invariants for pattern recognition and classification |author=Marcos A.

&lt;/ref&gt; A sum of only ''k''-grade components is called a ''k''-vector,&lt;ref name=Sommer&gt;{{cite book |title=Computer algebra and geometric algebra with applications |editor1=Hongbo Li |editor2=Peter J.

&lt;/ref&gt; or a ''homogeneous'' multivector.&lt;ref name=Sanfeliu&gt;{{cite book |title=Progress in pattern recognition, image analysis and applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gsnXS1xdeekC&amp;pg=PA25 |page=25 |editor1=Alberto Sanfeliu |editor2=José Francisco Martínez Trinidad |editor3=Jesús Ariel Carrasco Ochoa |author=Eduardo Bayro-Corrochano |chapter = Clifford geometric algebra: A promising framework for computer vision, robotics and learning |isbn=3-540-23527-2 |publisher=Springer |year=2004}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest grade element in a space is called a ''[[pseudoscalar]]''.

If a given element is homogeneous of a grade ''k'', then it is a ''k''-vector, but not necessarily a ''k''-blade.  Such an element is a ''k''-blade when it can be expressed as the wedge product of ''k'' vectors.  A geometric algebra generated by a 4-dimensional Euclidean vector space illustrates the point with an example: The sum of any two blades with one taken from the XY-plane and the other taken from the ZW-plane will form a 2-vector that is not a 2-blade.  In a geometric algebra generated by a Euclidean vector space of dimension 2 or 3, all sums of 2-blades may be written as a single 2-blade.

* 0-vectors are scalars;
* 1-vectors are vectors;
* 2-vectors are [[bivector]]s;
* (''n'' − 1)-vectors are [[pseudovector]]s;
* ''n''-vectors are [[pseudoscalar]]s.

In the presence of a [[volume form]] (such as given an [[inner product]] and an orientation), pseudovectors and pseudoscalars can be identified with vectors and scalars, which is routine in [[vector calculus]], but without a volume form this cannot be done without a choice.

In the [[algebra of physical space]] (the geometric algebra of Euclidean 3-space, used as a model of (3+1)-spacetime), a sum of a scalar and a vector is called a [[paravector]], and represents a point in spacetime (the vector the space, the scalar the time).

===Bivectors===
{{main|Bivector}}

A '''bivector''' is therefore an element of the [[antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetric]] [[tensor product]] of a [[tangent space]] with itself.

In [[geometric algebra]], also, a '''bivector''' is a grade 2 element (a 2-vector) resulting from the [[wedge product]] of two vectors, and so it is geometrically an ''oriented area'', in the same way a ''vector'' is an oriented line segment. If '''a''' and '''b''' are two vectors, the bivector {{nowrap|'''a''' ∧ '''b'''}} has

* a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] which is its area, given by
*:&lt;math&gt;\left\| \mathbf a \wedge \mathbf b \right\| = \left\| \mathbf{a} \right\| \, \left\| \mathbf{b} \right\| \, \sin(\phi_{a,b})&lt;/math&gt;
* a direction: the plane where that area lies on, i.e., the plane determined by '''a''' and '''b''', as long as they are linearly independent;
* an orientation (out of two), determined by the order in which the originating vectors are multiplied. 
Bivectors are connected to [[pseudovector]]s, and are used to represent rotations in geometric algebra.

As bivectors are elements of a vector space Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' (where ''V'' is a finite-dimensional vector space with {{nowrap|1=dim ''V'' = ''n''}}), it makes sense to define an [[inner product]] on this vector space as follows. First, write any element {{nowrap|''F'' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''V''}} in terms of a basis {{nowrap|1=('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;1 ≤ ''i'' &lt; ''j'' ≤ ''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''V''}} as

: &lt;math&gt;F = F^{ab} \mathbf{e}_a \wedge \mathbf{e}_b \quad (1 \le a &lt; b  \le n) ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Einstein summation convention]] is being used.

Now define a map {{nowrap|G : Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' × Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' → '''R'''}} by insisting that

: &lt;math&gt;G(F, H) := G_{abcd}F^{ab}H^{cd} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; are a set of numbers.

==Applications==
Bivectors play many important roles in physics, for example, in the [[classification of electromagnetic fields]].

{{Nihongo|'''Ninjō'''|[[wikt:人情|人情]]|"human emotion or compassion"}} in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], is human feeling that complements and opposes the value of [[giri (Japanese)|giri]], or social obligation, within the Japanese worldview.  Broadly speaking, ''ninjō'' is said to be the human feeling that inescapably springs up ''in conflict'' with social obligation.  As ''ninjō'' is a culture-specific term, the validity or importance of this concept is subject to a wide range of viewpoints, inextricably tied into one's perspective on [[nihonjinron]] as a whole.

The classic example of ''ninjō'' is that of a [[samurai]] who falls in love with an unacceptable partner (perhaps somebody of low social class or somebody of an enemy clan).  As a loyal member of his clan, he then becomes torn between the obligation to his feudal lord and his personal feelings, with the only possible resolution being ''[[shinjū]]'' or double love-suicide.  The correspondence to [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' or the [[Aeneid]] would be made by Japanese and non-Japanese alike.  The question of whether modern Japanese still feel a greater sense of giri than their Western counterparts, and thus remain in some ineffable way psychologically closer to this sort of giri-ninjo conflict is precisely where nihonjinron divides into the Japan-centric and Japan-skeptic camps.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6105">'''Oil regeneration''' - is extraction of contaminants from [[oil]] in order to restore its original properties to be used equally with fresh oils.&lt;ref name="Regeneration of spent transformer oil"&gt;[http://iasj.net/iasj?func=fulltext&amp;aId=24692 Abdul-Halim Adbul-Karim Mohammed, Mohammed Abbas Kadhum (December 2010). Regeneration of spent transformer oil. Journal of Engineering. Number 4. pp. 5799 -5810]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil aging==
Aging is a result of physical and [[chemical process]]es that change oil during storage and use in machines and mechanisms.
The main cause of aging is exposure to high [[temperature]]s and contact with air that leads to oxidation, decomposition, polymerization and condensation of hydrocarbons. Another cause of aging is contamination with metal particles, [[water]] and [[dust]]. Their accumulation leads to build up of slurries, resinous and asphaltic compounds, coke, soot, various salts and acids in the oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Difference between Oil Purification and Oil Regeneration|url=https://fuelcleaning.globecore.com/difference-between-oil-purification-and-oil-regeneration/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The oil in which aging process occurs, cannot fully perform its functions. Therefore, it is either replaced with new oil or regenerated.

==Regeneration by physical methods==
Physical methods of regeneration do not change the chemical properties of oil. They remove only mechanical impurities (metal particles, sand, dust, as well as tar, asphalt and coke-like substances, water).
Regeneration by physical methods include:
* [[sedimentation]]. This method is often used as the first stage in regeneration.  The contamination particles in oil settle down, due to gravity;&lt;ref name="Regeneration of used engine oil"&gt;[http://www.iaeng.org/publication/WCE2013/WCE2013_pp565-568.pdf Isah, A. G., Abdulkadir, M., Onifade, K. R., Musa, U., Garba, M. U., Bawa, A. A and Sani, Y. (3-5 July 2013). Regeneration of used engine oil. Proceedings of the World Congress on Engineering. Vol I.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[centrifugation]] - separates oil into layers (an oil layer, a rag layer, a water layer,) by centrifugal forces;&lt;ref name="Modern Approach to Problems of Transformer Oil Purification"&gt;[http://www.tribology.fink.rs/journals/2002/3-4/7.pdf Mačužić I., Jeremić B. (2002). Modern approach to problems of transformer oil purification. Tribology in industry. Vol. 24. No. 3&amp;4. pp. 39-43.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[filtration]] - separates suspensions into clean liquid and wet sediment with the help of filters;&lt;ref name="Used oil recycling markets and best management practices in the United States"&gt;[http://infohouse.p2ric.org/ref/05/04827.pdf Used oil recycling markets and best management practices in the United States. The National Recycling Congress. September 15, 1992. Boston, MA.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Washing with water and dry washing to remove acidic products from oil (water-soluble low-molecular acids, salts of organic acids).

==Regeneration by physicochemical methods==

Physicochemical methods are based on the use of [[Coagulation (water treatment)|coagulants]] and [[Adsorption|adsorbents]].&lt;ref name="Recycling of Used Lubricating Oil Using Three Samples of Acids
and Clay as a Method of Treatment"&gt;[http://www.soeagra.com/iaast/iaastjune2013/2.pdf Udonne J.D, Bakare O.A. (June 2013). Recycling of Used Lubricating Oil Using Three Samples of Acids and Clay as a Method of Treatment. IAAST Vol 4. pp. 8-14.]&lt;/ref&gt; Coagulants promote the coarsening and precipitation of fine-dispersed asphalt-resinous substances in oil. Adsorbents selectively absorb organic and inorganic compounds. These methods remove asphalt and resinous compounds, emulsified and dissolved water from oil. Adsorptive treatment with bleaching clays neutralizes free acid in acid-treated oil, unstable oxidized and sulphurized products as well as traces of sulphonic acid. In addition, clay treatment leads to higher resistance to oil oxidation at high temperatures and increased colour stability. This process is used in clay polishing plants for waste oil re-refining and transformer oil regeneration systems for the reclamation of old transformer oil to as-new condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Audibert|first1=François|title=Waste engine oils : rerefining and energy recovery|date=2006|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-444-52202-3|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regeneration by chemical methods==

Chemical methods of regeneration remove asphalt, silicic, acidic, some hetero-organic compounds and water from oils. These methods are based on the interaction of contaminating substances in oil with special [[reagent]]s introduced into them.&lt;ref name="Recycling of Used Lubricating Oil Using Three Samples of Acids
and Clay as a Method of Treatment"&gt;[http://www.soeagra.com/iaast/iaastjune2013/2.pdf Udonne J.D, Bakare O.A. (June 2013). Recycling of Used Lubricating Oil Using Three Samples of Acids and Clay as a Method of Treatment. IAAST Vol 4. pp. 8-14.]&lt;/ref&gt; The compounds formed as a result of these chemical reactions are then easily removed from oil. Chemical methods include acid and alkaline refining, drying with calcium sulphate or reduction with metal hydrides.

==Choice of methods of regeneration==

In practice, to achieve a complete regeneration of oil using only one method is difficult. Therefore, a combination of different approaches are often used.&lt;ref name="Experimental regeneration process of used motor oils"&gt;[http://www.cder.dz/download/Art17-2_15.pdf Danane F., Ahmia A., Bakiri A., Lalaoui N. (2014). Experimental regeneration process of used motor oils. Revue des Energies Renouvelables. Vol. 17. N°2. pp. 345 – 351]&lt;/ref&gt;
The choice of methods is influenced by factors such as the nature and origin of aging products, the requirements for regenerated oils, the amount of collected [[waste oil]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18756">The '''open–closed''' [[political spectrum]], or '''horseshoe theory''' is an alternative to the standard [[Left–right politics|left–right system]], especially used to describe the [[Cleavage (politics)|cleavage]] in political systems in Europe and North America in the 21st century. In this system, parties and voters are arranged on an axis from open ([[social liberalism|socially liberal]] and [[globalist]]) to closed ([[cultural conservatism|culturally conservative]] and [[protectionist]]). Each side draws from both traditionally left- and right-wing ideas and values: "closed" parties usually hold conventionally right-wing views on social issues but may support the left-wing policies of [[market intervention]] and [[redistribution of wealth]], while open parties can hold left-wing or progressive opinions on many issues but be staunchly in favour of the traditionally more rightist policies of [[free trade]]. Depending on context, open–closed can be a replacement to left–right or a second axis on a [[political compass]].&lt;ref name="Davos"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/will-politics-open-closed-replace-left-versus-right-1606328|title=Will the politics of 'open and closed' replace 'left versus right'?|date=13 February 2017|accessdate=9 May 2017|newspaper=International Business Times|first=James|last=Bloodworth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ID"/&gt;

A [[Realigning election|political realignment]] along these lines across the [[Western world]] has been described by political scientists in the wake of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], the [[Great Recession]] and the [[European migrant crisis]], with mainstream left-wing and right-wing political parties shifting or falling behind [[populism|populist]] parties and [[independent (politics)|independents]]. Examples of votes described as having been fought on open-closed lines include the [[UK EU membership referendum, 2016|2016 Brexit referendum]], presidential elections in [[Austrian presidential election, 2016|Austria in 2016]], [[United States presidential election, 2016|the United States in 2016]] and [[French presidential election, 2017|France in 2017]], and general elections in [[Polish parliamentary election, 2015|Poland in 2015]] and [[Dutch general election, 2017|the Netherlands in 2017]].&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21702748-new-divide-rich-countries-not-between-left-and-right-between-open-and|title=Drawbridges up|newspaper=The Economist|date=30 July 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://france-amerique.com/a-new-political-spectrum/|title=A New Political Spectrum|date=25 April 2017|accessdate=8 May 2017|first=Guy|last=Sorman|translator-first=Alexis|translator-last=Cornel|website=France-Amérique}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coming"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/opinion/the-coming-political-realignment.html|title=The Coming Political Realignment|date=1 July 2016|first=David|last=Brooks|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precursors and terminology==
[[File:Political spectrum horseshoe model.svg|thumb|The horseshoe theory states that extreme left and right have more in common with each other than the centre.|upright=1.2]]
Prior to the development of [[socialism]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the primary divide in British politics was between [[classical liberalism]] ([[Whiggism]]) and [[traditional conservatism]] ([[Toryism]]) as seen in debates about free trade and the [[Corn Laws]], and James Kirkup, writing in the ''Daily Telegraph'', has suggested that the open-closed split marks a return to this era of politics.&lt;ref name="TTIP"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11296902/From-immigration-to-trade-and-the-NHS-politics-is-about-open-vs-closed.html|title=From immigration to trade and the NHS, politics is about open vs closed|date=17 December 2014|accessdate=8 May 2017|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|first=James|last=Kirkup}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the rise of the socially-liberal [[New Left]] and socially-conservative [[Christian right|religious right]] in the 1970s, and the subsequent "[[culture war]]s", marked the beginning the open-closed cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bornschier |first=Simon |last2=Kriesi |first2=Hanspeter |editor-last=Rydgren |editor-first=Jens |title=Class Politics and the Radical Right |publisher=Routledge |date=2012 |pages=10–29 |chapter=The populist right, the working class, and the changing face of class politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fareed Zakaria]], writing in the ''Washington Post'', described the [[Nordic model]] of free market social democracy as another early example of open politics.&lt;ref name="Armed"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-politics-of-the-future-be-open-and-armed/2016/07/07/fd171ce0-447b-11e6-8856-f26de2537a9d_story.html|title=The politics of the future: Be open and armed|date=7 July 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017|newspaper=Washington Post|first=Fareed|last=Zakaria}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Stephan Shakespeare]], director of public opinion research at [[YouGov]], identified the divide in an analysis of the party positions in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 UK general election]], but termed closed and open voters "drawbridge up" and "drawbridge down" respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/apr/17/uk.election20054|title=They seem to be campaigning for the sake of it|first=Stephan|last=Shakespeare|authorlink=Stephan Shakespeare|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 April 2005|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "open" and "closed" for this divide were first used by then-British prime minister [[Tony Blair]] in 2006, with reference to the [[horseshoe theory]] that far-left and far-right politics are similar in substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2016/11/tony-blair-s-unfinished-business|title=Tony Blair’s unfinished business|first=Jason|last=Cowley|newspaper=New Statesman|date=24 November 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair, who declared himself staunchly for "open", had overseen the development of the [[Third Way]] [[New Labour]] movement in 1990s and the schism in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] between "open" Blairites and "closed" traditional socialists has remained.&lt;ref name="Armed"/&gt; Political analyst [[James Bloodworth (journalist)|James Bloodworth]] criticised Blair's choice of terminology, describing "closed" as pejorative to those threatened by globalism and "open" as overly laudatory of the "[[Davos Man]]" type of globalist.&lt;ref name="Davos"/&gt;

==Rise and development==
[[File:Angela Merkel Donald Trump 2017-03-17 (cropped).png|thumb|left|Although both are conservatives, the "open" [[Angela Merkel]] and "closed" [[Donald Trump]] fall at opposite ends of the spectrum.&lt;ref name="FA"/&gt;|alt=Merkel and Trump at a press conference together.|upright=1.2]]
Following the financial crisis and subsequent recession, plus the arrival of large numbers of [[refugees of the Syrian Civil War]], populist political parties made significant gains across the European Union. In southern European countries, these tended to be [[Anti-austerity movement|anti-austerity]] left-wing parties such as [[Syriza]] in Greece and [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] in Spain, while northern European countries saw [[anti-immigrant]] right-wing parties such as the [[UK Independence Party]] and the [[Alternative for Germany]] gain support.&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt; However all these parties shared a [[Eurosceptic]] and [[anti-establishment|anti-elite]] viewpoint, and appealed to the "left-behind" who saw their livelihoods or communities as threatened by globalism and immigration. [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|In 2015]], Syriza became the largest party in the [[Parliament of Greece]], while the right-wing populist [[Law and Justice]] became the first party since the fall of Communism to win an [[absolute majority]] in the Polish [[Sejm]] in [[Polish parliamentary election, 2015|elections the same year]].&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt; At the [[2016 UK EU membership referendum]], the Leave option narrowly defeated the [[bipartisanship|cross-party]] Remain option. The subsequent realignment of British politics saw the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], aligned with "Leave", and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], aligned with "Remain", rise in the polls while Labour, which remained deeply divided between its open and closed wings, lost ground rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/bes-findings/has-brexit-broken-british-voting/|title=Has Brexit Broken British Voting?|website=[[British Election Study]]|date=21 April 2017|accessdate=8 May 2017|first1=Jon|last1=Mellon|first2=Chris|last2=Prosser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar political developments followed in the United States in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Hillary Clinton]], liberal and pro-globalism, faced two political opponents who both represented protectionist viewpoints from opposite ends of the left–right spectrum: [[Bernie Sanders]], a [[democratic socialist]] who challenged her in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|primaries]], and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Donald Trump]], running on a [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] "[[America First (policy)|America First]]" platform.&lt;ref name="Coming"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newdivide"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21702750-farewell-left-versus-right-contest-matters-now-open-against-closed-new|title=The new political divide|date=30 July 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017|newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump eventually triumphed, winning several [[Rust Belt]] states from the "[[Blue wall (politics)|Blue Wall]]" of Democratic [[safe state]]s which had suffered [[deindustrialisation]] and economic deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/09/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-blue-wall|title=Trump stomps all over the Democrats' Blue Wall|publisher=CNN|date=9 November 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While "closed" politicians scored several electoral victories, another realignment in the [[political centre]] began in Europe, as [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] [[pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] voters abandoned traditional [[Major party|parties of government]] and clustered around new liberal parties and independent politicians. In the Netherlands, where the closed anti-Islam and anti-European [[Party for Freedom]] (PVV) under [[Geert Wilders]] led [[Opinion polling for the Dutch general election, 2017|opinion polls]] for much of the previous parliament, the liberal pro-EU [[Democrats 66]] and the [[green politics|green]] [[GroenLinks]] positioned themselves as the main open opponents of the PVV. At the [[Dutch general election, 2017|2017 elections]], all three parties made significant gains at the expense of the established parties.&lt;ref name="ID"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21718921-identity-does-not-have-be-exclusive-preserve-far-right-dutch-election-suggests|title=The Dutch election suggests a new kind of identity politics|date=18 March 2017|accessdate=8 May 2017|newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Van der Bellen]], an independent formerly of [[The Greens – The Green Alternative|The Greens]], defeated the anti-immigrant [[Norbert Hofer]] of the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] in the [[Austrian presidential election, 2016|2016 Austrian presidential election]], while [[Emmanuel Macron]], a former member of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialists]] who described himself as "neither left nor right" and who founded his own party [[En Marche]], defeated the [[Front National (France)|Front National]] candidate [[Marine Le Pen]] in the [[French presidential election, 2017|2017 French presidential election]]. In both cases, neither of the mainstream parties of left and right reached the [[Two-round system|second round of voting]] – instead, each election saw an open centrist independent against a closed [[far-right politics|far-right]] party.&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ID"/&gt;

==Open and closed policies==
Although they can come from all sides of the left–right spectrum, closed parties share common ground on many issues, as likewise do open parties.

===Immigration and social integration===
Opposition to immigration is one of the starkest divides between open and closed parties. The closed position supports restrictions on migration, and prefers that immigrants [[Social integration|integrate]] into the national culture. By contrast, the open position takes a more liberal stance on migration, and tolerates or even celebrates [[multiculturalism]].&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt; Both left-wing and right-wing parties can be closed on the topic of immigration: the conservative Polish Law and Justice accuses immigrants of undermining Polish values and bringing in terrorists, while the socialist German [[Left Party (Germany)|Left Party]] considers immigrants a drain on the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt;{{Not in source|date=February 2018}} Conversely, in the United Kingdom for example the [[Adam Smith Institute]] (a [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] right-wing organisation) and [[Vince Cable]] (a left-wing [[social democrat]] and former [[Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy|business secretary]]) stand together as some of the strongest defenders of immigration.&lt;ref name="TTIP"/&gt;

===Trade and economic integration===
Issues of [[international trade]] and [[international cooperation]] are another significant line of division between the two camps. In the open ideology, free trade and globalism is a net good, strengthening the national economy and providing jobs while cutting prices. In the closed ideology, free trade is detrimental to the national economy and encourages companies to [[offshoring|offshore]] industries, resulting in lower wages and higher unemployment, as well as potentially threatening national culture.&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coming"/&gt; The closed attitude to globalism manifests in opposition to trade agreements such as the [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]], to [[military alliance]]s such as [[NATO]], and to [[supranational union]]s such as the EU, which are generally supported by the open side.&lt;ref name="newdivide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TTIP"/&gt;

===Elites and anti-establishmentism===
Pro-closed politicians opposing free trade and immigration usually describe these as impositions from an existing political [[elite]], either within the country or outside its borders, and campaign on an [[anti-establishment]] platform. In the most extreme case, this can cross over into [[conspiracism]], alleging that shadowy figures are actively trying to harm the nation.&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt;

===Identity===
[[Identity politics]] plays a role in forming both the open and closed coalitions. Pro-closed voters tend to have a strong sense of [[national identity]], while pro-open ones share a more cosmopolitan identity. This does not mean that all closed voters are racist, nor that all open voters are unpatriotic. Nationalist pride can be enhanced by the arrival of newcomers, if these [[cultural assimilation|assimilate]] to the national culture quickly.&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt; Conversely some open politicians, such as [[Jesse Klaver]], leader of GroenLinks, and Emmanuel Macron, have succeeded in developing a patriotic alternative to nationalism in which tolerance and cooperation are themselves considered national values to be prized and protected.&lt;ref name="ID"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/bd6cc7da-2a75-11e7-bc4b-5528796fe35c|title=Emmanuel Macron offers the patriotic antidote to nationalism |date=27 April 2017|accessdate=9 May 2017|newspaper=Financial Times|first=Philip|last=Stephens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics of cleavage==
Political scientists have identified several lines of cleavage between supporters of open and closed parties. [[Educational attainment]] was the strongest predictor of voting preference in the Brexit referendum and the 2016/2017 US, Dutch and French elections: in each case, those with low educational achievement were more likely to vote for the closed or populist option.&lt;ref name="MacronCharts"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/62d782d6-31a7-11e7-9555-23ef563ecf9a|title=French election results: Macron’s victory in charts|date=8 May 2017|accessdate=8 May 2017|first1=John|last1=Burn-Murdoch|first2=Billy|last2=Ehrenberg-Shannon|first3=Aleksandra|last3=Wisniewska|first4=Aendrew|last4=Rininsland|newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was described by the BBC as "one of the most remarkable features of the US election", as the Republican party usually performs well among university graduates.&lt;ref name="Revolt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37943072|title=US election 2016: The Trump-Brexit voter revolt|first=John|last=Curtice|authorlink=John Curtice|website=BBC News|date=11 November 2016|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Income has been suggested as another dividing line: in the EU referendum, the bottom fifth of UK earners overwhelmingly voted for Brexit (68% Leave, 32% Remain) while a large majority of the top quarter voted against Brexit (39% Leave, 61% Remain). However, Trump performed better with middle class voters than with either the highest or lowest earners and, although a small wealth effect was seen among French voters, this disappeared when [[Controlling for a variable|controlling for]] education.&lt;ref name="MacronCharts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Revolt"/&gt;

[[Pessimism]] and [[optimism]] also appear to be important psychological factors in determining whether a voter chooses an open or a closed candidate. Le Pen only took 20% of the vote of those who believed the situation would improve for the next generation, but over 40% among those who believed it would deteriorate.&lt;ref name="MacronCharts"/&gt; A majority of Leave voters agreed life in Britain is worse than it was thirty years ago, while a majority of Remain voters disagreed.&lt;ref name="Drawbridges"/&gt;

In [[electrical engineering]], the '''power factor''' of an [[alternating current|AC]] electrical power system is defined as the [[ratio]] of the ''[[AC power#Active, reactive, and apparent power|real power]]'' absorbed by the [[electrical load|load]] to the ''apparent power'' flowing in the circuit, and is a [[dimensionless number]] in the [[closed interval]] of −1 to 1. A power factor of less than one indicates the voltage and current are not in phase, reducing the instantaneous [[Product (mathematics)|product]] of the two. [[Power (physics)|Real power]] is the instantaneous product of voltage and current and represents the capacity of the electricity for performing work. Apparent power is the product of average current and voltage. Due to energy stored in the load and returned to the source, or due to a non-linear load that distorts the wave shape of the current drawn from the source, the apparent power may be greater than the real power. A negative power factor occurs when the device (which is normally the load) generates power, which then flows back towards the source.

In an electric power system, a load with a low power factor draws more current than a load with a high power factor for the same amount of useful power transferred. The higher currents increase the energy lost in the distribution system, and require larger wires and other equipment. Because of the costs of larger equipment and wasted energy, electrical utilities will usually charge a higher cost to industrial or commercial customers where there is a low power factor.

'''Power-factor correction''' increases the power factor of a load, improving efficiency for the distribution system to which it is attached. Linear loads with low power factor (such as [[induction motor]]s) can be corrected with a passive network of [[capacitor]]s or [[inductor]]s. Non-linear loads, such as [[rectifier]]s, distort the current drawn from the system. In such cases, active or passive power factor correction may be used to counteract the distortion and raise the power factor. The devices for correction of the power factor may be at a central [[electrical substation|substation]], spread out over a distribution system, or built into power-consuming equipment.

== Linear circuits ==

[[File:Power factor 0.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.36|Instantaneous and average power calculated from AC voltage and current with a zero power factor (&lt;math&gt;\varphi=90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\cos\varphi=0&lt;/math&gt;). The blue line shows all the power is stored temporarily in the load during the first quarter cycle and returned to the grid during the second quarter cycle, so no real power is consumed.]]

[[File:Power factor 0.7.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.36|Instantaneous and average power calculated from AC voltage and current with a lagging power factor (&lt;math&gt;\varphi=45^\circ&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\cos\varphi\approx0.71&lt;/math&gt;). The blue line shows some of the power is returned to the grid during the part of the cycle labeled &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.]]

In a purely resistive AC circuit, voltage and current waveforms are in step (or [[Phase (waves)|in phase]]), changing polarity at the same instant in each cycle. All the power entering the load is consumed (or dissipated).

Where [[Reactance (electronics)|reactive]] loads are present, such as with [[capacitor]]s or [[inductor]]s, energy storage in the loads results in a phase difference between the current and voltage waveforms. During each cycle of the AC voltage, extra energy, in addition to any energy consumed in the load, is temporarily stored in the load in [[Electric field|electric]] or [[magnetic field]]s, and then returned to the power grid a fraction of the period later.

Because [[high voltage]] alternating current distribution systems are essentially quasi-linear circuit systems subject to continuous daily variation, there is a continuous "ebb and flow" of nonproductive power. Non productive power increases the current in the line, potentially to the point of failure.

Thus, a circuit with a low power factor will use higher currents to transfer a given quantity of real power than a circuit with a high power factor. A linear load does not change the shape of the waveform of the current, but may change the relative timing (phase) between voltage and current.

Electrical circuits containing dominantly resistive loads (incandescent lamps, heating elements) have a power factor of almost 1.0, but circuits containing inductive or capacitive loads (electric motors, [[solenoid]] valves, transformers, [[Electrical ballast|fluorescent lamp ballasts]], and others) can have a power factor well below 1.

=== Definition and calculation ===
[[AC power]] flow has two components:
* Real power or active power (&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;) (sometimes called average power&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introductory Circuit Analysis|last=Boylestad|first=Robert|publisher=|isbn=978-0-13-097417-4|edition=10th|location=|date=2002-03-04|pages=857}}&lt;/ref&gt;), expressed in [[watt]]s (W)
* Reactive power (&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;), usually expressed in [[volt-ampere reactive|reactive volt-amperes]] (var)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SI Units – Electricity and Magnetism |publisher = International Electrotechnical Commission |url=http://www.iec.ch/zone/si/si_elecmag.htm | place = [[Switzerland|CH]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071211234311/http://www.iec.ch/zone/si/si_elecmag.htm#si_epo |archivedate = 2007-12-11 |access-date= 14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are combined to the complex power (&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;) expressed [[volt-amperes]] (VA). The magnitude of the complex power is the apparent power (&lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt;), also expressed in volt-amperes (VA).

The VA and var are non-SI units mathematically identical to the watt, but are used in engineering practice instead of the watt to state what [[physical quantity|quantity]] is being expressed. The [[SI]] explicitly disallows using units for this purpose or as the only source of information about a physical quantity as used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The International System of Units (SI) [SI brochure]|url=http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf|year=2006|publisher=[[BIPM]]|location=§&amp;nbsp;5.3.2 (p.&amp;nbsp;132, 40 in the [[PDF]] file)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power factor is defined as the ratio of real power to apparent power. As power is transferred along a transmission line, it does not consist purely of real power that can do work once transferred to the load, but rather consists of a combination of real and reactive power, called apparent power. The power factor describes the amount of real power transmitted along a transmission line relative to the total apparent power flowing in the line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] | id = Std. 100 | title = Authoritative Dictionary of Standards Terms | edition = 7th | isbn = 978-0-7381-2601-2| year = 2000 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = IEEE | id = Std. 1459–2000 | title = Trial-Use Standard Definitions for the Measurement of Electric Power Quantities Under Sinusoidal, Nonsinusoidal, Balanced, or Unbalanced Conditions | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-7381-1963-2}}.  Note 1, section 3.1.1.1, when defining the quantities for power factor, asserts that real power only flows to the load and can never be negative. As of 2013, one of the authors acknowledged that this note was incorrect, and is being revised for the next edition. See http://powerstandards.com/Shymanski/draft.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Power triangle ====
[[File:Power triangle diagram.jpg|frameless|upright=1.68]]

One can relate the various components of AC power by using the power triangle in vector space. Real power extends horizontally in the î direction as it represents a purely real component of AC power. Reactive power extends in the direction of ĵ as it represents a purely imaginary component of AC power. Complex power (and its magnitude, Apparent power) represents a combination of both real and reactive power, and therefore can be calculated by using the vector sum of these two components. We can conclude that the mathematical relationship between these components is:

                               S &amp;= P + jQ \\
                               |S|^2 &amp;= P^2 + Q^2 \\[3pt]
                               |S| &amp;= \sqrt{P^2 + Q^2} \\
  \cos\theta\text{, power factor} &amp;= \frac{P\text{, real power}}{|S|\text{, apparent power}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Increasing the power factor ====
[[File:Increased power factor.jpg|frameless|upright=1.8]]

As the power factor (i.e. cos ''θ'') increases, the ratio of real power to apparent power (which = cos ''θ''), increases and approaches unity (1), while the angle ''θ'' decreases and the reactive power decreases. [As cos ''θ'' → 1, its maximum possible value, ''θ'' → 0 and so Q → 0, as the load becomes less reactive and more purely resistive].

==== Decreasing the power factor ====
[[File:Decreased power factor.jpg|frameless|upright=1.85]]

As the power factor decreases, the ratio of real power to apparent power also decreases, as the angle θ increases and reactive power increases.

==== Lagging and leading power factors ====
There is also a difference between a lagging and leading power factor. The terms refer to whether the phase of the current is leading or lagging the phase of the voltage. A lagging power factor signifies that the load is inductive, as the load will “consume” reactive power, and therefore the reactive component &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is positive as reactive power travels through the circuit and is “consumed” by the inductive load. A leading power factor signifies that the load is capacitive, as the load “supplies” reactive power, and therefore the reactive component &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is negative as reactive power is being supplied to the circuit.

[[File:Lagging-Leading.jpg|frameless|upright=2.66]]

If θ is the [[phase angle]] between the current and voltage, then the power factor is equal to the [[Trigonometric functions|cosine]] of the angle, &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;|P| = |S| \cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;

Since the units are consistent, the power factor is by definition a [[dimensionless number]] between −1 and 1. When power factor is equal to 0, the energy flow is entirely reactive and stored energy in the load returns to the source on each cycle. When the power factor is 1, all the energy supplied by the source is consumed by the load. Power factors are usually stated as "leading" or "lagging" to show the sign of the phase angle. Capacitive loads are leading (current leads voltage), and inductive loads are lagging (current lags voltage).

If a purely resistive load is connected to a power supply, current and voltage will change polarity in step, the power factor will be 1, and the electrical energy flows in a single direction across the network in each cycle. Inductive loads such as induction motors (any type of wound coil) consume reactive power with current waveform lagging the voltage. Capacitive loads such as capacitor banks or buried cable generate reactive power with current phase leading the voltage. Both types of loads will absorb energy during part of the AC cycle, which is stored in the device's magnetic or electric field, only to return this energy back to the source during the rest of the cycle.

For example, to get 1&amp;nbsp;kW of real power, if the power factor is unity, 1&amp;nbsp;kVA of apparent power needs to be transferred (1&amp;nbsp;kW ÷ 1 = 1&amp;nbsp;kVA). At low values of power factor, more apparent power needs to be transferred to get the same real power. To get 1&amp;nbsp;kW of real power at 0.2 power factor, 5&amp;nbsp;kVA of apparent power needs to be transferred (1&amp;nbsp;kW ÷ 0.2 = 5&amp;nbsp;kVA). This apparent power must be produced and transmitted to the load, and is subject to the losses in the production and transmission processes.

Electrical loads consuming [[AC power|alternating current power]] consume both real power and reactive power. The vector sum of real and reactive power is the apparent power. The presence of reactive power causes the real power to be less than the apparent power, and so, the electric load has a power factor of less than 1.

A negative power factor (0 to −1) can result from returning power to the source, such as in the case of a building fitted with solar panels when surplus power is fed back into the supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = On the resistance and electromotive forces of the electric arc |first=W. | last = Duddell | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=203 |issue=359–371 |doi=10.1098/rsta.1904.0022  | pages = 512–15 | year = 1901 | quote = The fact that the solid arc has, at low frequencies, a negative power factor, indicates that the arc is supplying power to the alternator…}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Analysis of some measurement issues in bushing power factor tests in the field |first=S. |last=Zhang |journal= IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery|volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=1350–56 |date=July 2006 |quote=…(the measurement) gives both negative power factor and negative resistive current (power loss) |doi=10.1109/tpwrd.2006.874616}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Performance of Grid-Connected Induction Generator under Naturally Commutated AC Voltage Controller |first=A.

=== Power factor correction of linear loads ===
A high power factor is generally desirable in a power delivery system to reduce losses and improve voltage regulation at the load. Compensating elements near an electrical load will reduce the apparent power demand on the supply system. Power factor correction may be applied by an [[electric power transmission]] utility to improve the stability and efficiency of the network. Individual electrical customers who are charged by their utility for low power factor may install correction equipment to increase their power factor so as to reduce costs.

Power factor correction brings the power factor of an AC power circuit closer to 1 by supplying or absorbing reactive power, adding capacitors or inductors that act to cancel the inductive or capacitive effects of the load, respectively. In the case of offsetting the inductive effect of motor loads, capacitors can be locally connected. These capacitors help to generate reactive power to meet the demand of the inductive loads. This will keep that reactive power from having to flow all the way from the utility generator to the load. In the electricity industry, inductors are said to consume reactive power and capacitors are said to supply it, even though reactive power is just energy moving back and forth on each AC cycle.

The reactive elements in power factor correction devices can create voltage fluctuations and harmonic noise when switched on or off. They will supply or sink reactive power regardless of whether there is a corresponding load operating nearby, increasing the system's no-load losses. In the worst case, reactive elements can interact with the system and with each other to create resonant conditions, resulting in system instability and severe [[overvoltage]] fluctuations. As such, reactive elements cannot simply be applied without engineering analysis.

[[File:Condensatorenbatterij.jpg|right|thumb|1. [[Reactive Power Control Relay]]; 2. Network connection points; 3. [[Fuse (electrical)|Slow-blow Fuses]]; 4. Inrush Limiting [[Contactor]]s; 5. [[Capacitor]]s (single-phase or three-phase units, delta-connection); 6. [[Transformer]] (for controls and ventilation fans) ]]

An '''automatic power factor correction unit''' consists of a number of [[capacitor]]s that are switched by means of [[contactor]]s. These contactors are controlled by a regulator that measures power factor in an electrical network. Depending on the load and power factor of the network, the power factor controller will switch the necessary blocks of capacitors in steps to make sure the power factor stays above a selected value.

Instead of using a set of switched [[capacitor]]s, an unloaded [[synchronous motor]] can supply reactive power. The [[reactive power]] drawn by the synchronous motor is a function of its field excitation. This is referred to as a '''[[synchronous condenser]]'''. It is started and connected to the [[electrical network]]. It operates at a leading power factor and puts [[volt-ampere reactive|vars]] onto the network as required to support a system's [[voltage]] or to maintain the system power factor at a specified level.

The synchronous condenser's installation and operation are identical to large [[electric motor]]s. Its principal advantage is the ease with which the amount of correction can be adjusted; it behaves like a variable capacitor. Unlike capacitors, the amount of reactive power supplied is proportional to voltage, not the square of voltage; this improves voltage stability on large networks.  Synchronous condensers are often used in connection with [[High-voltage direct current|high-voltage direct-current]] transmission projects or in large industrial plants such as [[steel mill]]s.

For power factor correction of high-voltage power systems or large, fluctuating industrial loads, power electronic devices such as the [[Static VAR compensator]] or [[STATCOM]] are increasingly used. These systems are able to compensate sudden changes of power factor much more rapidly than contactor-switched capacitor banks, and being solid-state require less maintenance than synchronous condensers.

== Non-linear loads ==
Examples of non-linear loads on a power system are rectifiers (such as used in a power supply), and arc discharge devices such as [[fluorescent lamp]]s, electric [[welding]] machines, or [[arc furnace]]s. Because current in these systems is interrupted by a switching action, the current contains frequency components that are multiples of the power system frequency. Distortion power factor is a measure of how much the harmonic distortion of a load current decreases the average power transferred to the load.
[[File:Power factor 75 2.png|right|thumb|upright=1.36|Sinusoidal voltage and non-sinusoidal current give a distortion power factor of 0.75 for this computer power supply load.]]

=== Non-sinusoidal components ===
In linear circuits having only sinusoidal currents and voltages of one frequency, the power factor arises only from the difference in phase between the current and voltage. This is "displacement power factor".&lt;ref name="FuchsMasoum2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ewald Fuchs|author2=Mohammad A. S. Masoum|title=Power Quality in Power Systems and Electrical Machines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wuGcBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA432|date=14 July 2015|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-12-800988-8|pages=432–|quote=The DPF it the cosine of the angle between these two quantities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-linear loads change the shape of the current waveform from a [[sine wave]] to some other form. Non-linear loads create [[harmonic]] currents in addition to the original (fundamental frequency) AC current. This is of importance in practical power systems that contain [[non-linear]] loads such as [[rectifiers]], some forms of electric lighting, [[electric arc furnace]]s, welding equipment, [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]], variable speed drives and other devices. Filters consisting of linear capacitors and inductors can prevent harmonic currents from entering the supplying system.

To measure the real power or reactive power, a [[wattmeter]] designed to work properly with non-sinusoidal currents must be used.

=== Distortion power factor ===
The ''distortion power factor'' is the distortion component associated with the harmonic voltages and currents present in the system.
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mbox{distortion power factor}
&amp; = \frac{ I_1}{I_{rms}} \\
&amp; = \frac{I_1} {\sqrt{I_1^2+I_2^2+I_3^2+I_4^2+\cdots}} \\
&amp; = \frac{1} { \sqrt{1+ \frac{I_2^2+I_3^2+I_4^2+\cdots}{I_1^2}}} \\
&amp; = \frac{1} {\sqrt{ 1+THD_i^2}} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\mbox{THD}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[total harmonic distortion]] of the load current. 
:&lt;math&gt;THD_i = \frac{\sqrt{\displaystyle\sum_{h=2}^\infty I_h^2}} {I_1}= \frac{\sqrt{I_2^2+I_3^2+I_4^2+\cdots}} {I_1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt; is the fundamental component of the current and &lt;math&gt;I_{\mbox{rms}}&lt;/math&gt; is the total current – both are [[root mean square]]-values (distortion power factor can also be used to describe individual order harmonics, using the corresponding current in place of total current). This definition with respect to total harmonic distortion assumes that the voltage stays undistorted (sinusoidal, without harmonics). This simplification is often a good approximation for stiff voltage sources (not being affected by changes in load downstream in the distribution network). Total harmonic distortion of typical generators from current distortion in the network is on the order of 1–2%, which can have larger scale implications but can be ignored in common practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://ecmweb.com/power-quality/effects-harmonics-power-systems |title=Effects of Harmonics on Power Systems |first=C. |last=Sankaran |year=1999 |publisher=Electro-Test |quote=...and voltage-time relationship deviates from the pure sine function. The distortion at the point of generation is very small (about 1% to 2%), but nonetheless it exists.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result when multiplied with the displacement power factor (DPF) is the overall, true power factor or just power factor (PF):
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{PF} = \frac{\cos{\varphi}} {\sqrt{ 1+THD_i^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Distortion in three-phase networks ===
In practice, the local effects of distortion current on devices in a [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase distribution network]] rely on the magnitude of certain order harmonics rather than the total harmonic distortion.

For example, the triplen, or zero-sequence, harmonics (3rd, 9th, 15th, etc.) have the property of being in-phase when compared line-to-line. In a [[delta-wye transformer]], these harmonics can result in circulating currents in the delta windings and result in greater [[Joule heating|resistive heating]]. In a wye-configuration of a transformer, triplen harmonics will not create these currents, but they will result in a non-zero current in the [[Ground and neutral|neutral wire]]. This could overload the neutral wire in some cases
and create error in kilowatt-hour metering systems and billing revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.pge.com/includes/docs/pdfs/mybusiness/customerservice/energystatus/powerquality/harmonics.pdf | title = Power System Harmonics | publisher = Pacific Gas and Electric | chapter = Single-phase load harmonics vs. three-phase load harmonics | format = [[PDF]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://energylogix.ca/harmonics_and_ieee.pdf | title = Harmonics and IEEE 519 | publisher = EnergyLogix Solutions | chapter = Harmonic Effects | place = [[Canada|CA]] | format = [[PDF]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of current harmonics in a transformer also result in larger [[eddy currents]] in the magnetic core of the transformer. Eddy current losses generally increase as the square of the frequency, lowering the transformer's efficiency, dissipating additional heat, and reducing its service life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://ecmweb.com/power-quality/effects-harmonics-power-systems |title=Effects of Harmonics on Power Systems |first=C. |last=Sankaran |year=1999 |publisher = Electro-Test |section=Transformers}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative-sequence harmonics (5th, 11th, 17th, etc.) combine 120 degrees out of phase, similarly to the fundamental harmonic but in a reversed sequence.  In generators and motors, these currents produce magnetic fields which oppose the rotation of the shaft and sometimes result in damaging mechanical vibrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://ecmweb.com/power-quality/effects-harmonics-power-systems |title=Effects of Harmonics on Power Systems |first=C. |last=Sankaran |year=1999 |publisher=Electro-Test |section=Motors |quote=The interaction between the positive and negative sequence magnetic fields and currents produces torsional oscillations of the motor shaft. These oscillations result in shaft vibrations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switched-mode power supplies ===
{{Main|switched-mode power supply#Power factor}}
A particularly important class of non-linear loads is the millions of personal computers that typically incorporate [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]] (SMPS) with rated output power ranging from a few watts to more than 1&amp;nbsp;kW. Historically, these very-low-cost power supplies incorporated a simple full-wave rectifier that conducted only when the [[Mains electricity|mains]] instantaneous voltage exceeded the voltage on the input capacitors.  This leads to very high [[peak-to-average ratio|ratios of peak-to-average]] input current, which also lead to a low distortion power factor and potentially serious phase and neutral loading concerns.

A typical switched-mode power supply first converts the AC mains to a DC bus by means of a [[bridge rectifier]] or a similar circuit. The output voltage is then derived from this DC bus. The problem with this is that the [[rectifier]] is a non-linear device, so the input current is highly non-linear. That means that the input current has energy at [[harmonic]]s of the frequency of the voltage.

This presents a particular problem for the power companies, because they cannot compensate for the harmonic current by adding simple capacitors or inductors, as they could for the reactive power drawn by a linear load. Many jurisdictions are beginning to legally require power factor correction for all power supplies above a certain power level.

Regulatory agencies such as the [[European Union|EU]] have set harmonic limits as a method of improving power factor. Declining component cost has hastened implementation of two different methods. To comply with current EU standard EN61000-3-2, all switched-mode power supplies with output power more than 75&amp;nbsp;W must include passive power factor correction, at least. [[80 Plus]] power supply certification requires a power factor of 0.9 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.80plus.org/ | publisher = 80 Plus | title = Certified Power Supplies and Manufacturers | section = What is an 80 PLUS certified power supply?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power factor correction (PFC) in non-linear loads ===

==== Passive PFC ====
The simplest way to control the [[Harmonics (electrical power)|harmonic]] current is to use a [[electronic filter|filter]] that passes current only at [[utility frequency|line frequency]] (50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz). The filter consists of capacitors or inductors, and makes a non-linear device look more like a [[linear]] load. An example of passive PFC is a [[valley-fill circuit]].

A disadvantage of passive PFC is that it requires larger inductors or capacitors than an equivalent power active PFC circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.nuvation.com/corporate/news/newsletter/fall2006/powersupply.html |publisher=Nuvation |date=Fall 2006 |title=Power Supply Design Principles: Techniques and Solutions, Part 3 |newspaper=Newsletter |first=Ben |last=Schramm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309134617/http://www.nuvation.com/corporate/news/newsletter/fall2006/powersupply.html |archivedate=2007-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = Xplore | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1187344 | title = Quasi-active power factor correction with a variable inductive filter: theory, design and practice | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 248–255 | publisher = IEEE| doi = 10.1109/TPEL.2002.807135 | year = 2003 | last1 = Wolfle | first1 = W.H. | last2 = Hurley | first2 = W.G. }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher=Nuigalway |type=project |url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/power_electronics/projects/quasi_active.html |place=[[Ireland|IE]] |title=Power electronics |contribution=Quasi-active Power Factor Correction: The Role of Variable Inductance |last1=Wölfle |first1=W.

==== Active PFC ====
[[File:Active pfc PSU packaging.png|right|thumb|Specifications taken from the packaging of a 610 W [[Power supply unit (computer)|PC power supply]] showing active PFC rating]]

Active PFC is the use of [[power electronics]] to change the waveform of current drawn by a load to improve the power factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Fairchild Semiconductor | year = 2004 | type = application note | number = 42047 | title = Power Factor Correction (PFC) Basics | url = http://www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-42047.pdf | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some types of the active PFC are [[Buck converter|buck]], [[Boost converter|boost]], [[Buck-boost converter|buck-boost]] and [[synchronous condenser]].  Active power factor correction can be single-stage or multi-stage.

In the case of a switched-mode power supply, a [[boost converter]] is inserted between the bridge rectifier and the main input capacitors. The boost converter attempts to maintain a constant DC bus voltage on its output while drawing a current that is always in phase with and at the same frequency as the line voltage. Another switched-mode converter inside the power supply produces the desired output voltage from the DC bus. This approach requires additional semiconductor switches and control electronics, but permits cheaper and smaller passive components. It is frequently used in practice.

For a three-phase SMPS, the [[Vienna rectifier]] configuration may be used to substantially improve the power factor.

[[Switched-mode power supply|SMPSs]] with passive PFC can achieve power factor of about 0.7–0.75, SMPSs with active PFC, up to 0.99 power factor, while a SMPS without any power factor correction have a power factor of only about 0.55–0.65.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Sugawara |first1=I. |last2=Suzuki |first2=Y. |last3=Takeuchi |first3=A. |last4=Teshima |first4=T. |contribution=Experimental studies on active and passive PFC circuits |title=INTELEC 97, 19th International Telecommunications Energy Conference |date=19–23 Oct 1997 |pages=571–78 |doi=10.1109/INTLEC.1997.646051|isbn=978-0-7803-3996-5 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their very wide input voltage range, many power supplies with active PFC can automatically adjust to operate on AC power from about 100&amp;nbsp;V (Japan) to 240&amp;nbsp;V (Europe). That feature is particularly welcome in power supplies for laptops.

==== Dynamic PFC ====
Dynamic power factor correction (DPFC), sometimes referred to as "real-time power factor correction," is used for electrical stabilization in cases of rapid load changes (e.g. at large manufacturing sites). DPFC is useful when standard power factor correction would cause over or under correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Chavez |first=C. |last2=Houdek |first2=J. A. |title=Dynamic Harmonic Mitigation and power factor correction |journal=IEE |date=9–11 Oct 2007|volume=Electrical Power Quality |pages=1–5 |doi=10.1109/EPQU.2007.4424144 |isbn=978-84-690-9441-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  DPFC uses semiconductor switches, typically [[thyristor]]s, to quickly connect and disconnect capacitors or inductors to improve power factor.

== Importance of power factor in distribution systems ==
[[File:Condensor bank 150kV - 75MVAR.jpg|thumb|upright|75 Mvar capacitor bank in a 150 kV substation]]
Power factors below 1.0 require a utility to generate more than the minimum volt-amperes necessary to supply the real power (watts). This increases generation and transmission costs. For example, if the load power factor were as low as 0.7, the apparent power would be 1.4 times the real power used by the load. Line current in the circuit would also be 1.4 times the current required at 1.0 power factor, so the losses in the circuit would be doubled (since they are proportional to the square of the current). Alternatively, all components of the system such as generators, conductors, transformers, and switchgear would be increased in size (and cost) to carry the extra current. When the power factor is close to unity, for the same KVA rating of the transformer more load can be connected&lt;ref&gt;https://www.electricalclassroom.com/power-factor/&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Utilities typically charge additional costs to commercial customers who have a power factor below some limit, which is typically 0.9 to 0.95.  Engineers are often interested in the power factor of a load as one of the factors that affect the efficiency of power transmission.

With the rising cost of energy and concerns over the efficient delivery of power, active PFC has become more common in consumer electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = ON Semiconductor | year = 2007 | title = Power Factor Correction Handbook | url = http://www.onsemi.com/pub_link/Collateral/HBD853-D.PDF | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Current [[Energy Star]] guidelines for computers&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | format = PDF | place = US | url = http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/prod_development/revisions/downloads/computer/Version5.0_Computer_Spec.pdf | publisher = Energy Star | title = Program Requirements for Computers | edition = Version 5.0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; call for a power factor of ≥ 0.9 at 100% of rated output in the [[Power supply unit (computer)|PC's power supply]]. According to a white paper authored by Intel and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], PCs with internal power supplies will require the use of active power factor correction to meet the ENERGY STAR 5.0 Program Requirements for Computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Bolioli |first1=T. |last2=Duggirala |first2=M. |last3=Haines |first3=E. |last4=Kolappan |first4=R. |last5=Wong |first5=H. |year=2009 |publisher=Energy Star |title=Version 5.0 System Implementation |type=white paper |format=PDF |url=http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/product_specs/program_reqs/Computers_Intel_Whitepaper_Spec5.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, [[IEC EN 61000-3-2|EN 61000-3-2]] requires power factor correction be incorporated into consumer products.

Small customers, such as households, are not usually charged for reactive power and so power factor metering equipment for such customers will not be installed.

== Techniques for measuring the power factor ==

The power factor in a single-phase circuit (or balanced three-phase circuit) can be measured with the wattmeter-ammeter-voltmeter method, where the power in watts is divided by the product of measured voltage and current. The power factor of a balanced polyphase circuit is the same as that of any phase. The power factor of an unbalanced poly phase circuit is not uniquely defined.

A direct reading power factor meter can be made with a [[moving coil meter]] of the electrodynamic type, carrying two perpendicular coils on the moving part of the instrument. The field of the instrument is energized by the circuit current flow. The two moving coils, A and B, are connected in parallel with the circuit load.  One coil, A, will be connected through a resistor and the second coil, B, through an inductor, so that the current in coil B is delayed with respect to current in A. At unity power factor, the current in A is in phase with the circuit current, and coil A provides maximum torque, driving the instrument pointer toward the 1.0 mark on the scale. At zero power factor, the current in coil B is in phase with circuit current, and coil B provides torque to drive the pointer towards 0. At intermediate values of power factor, the torques provided by the two coils add and the pointer takes up intermediate positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first1=Donald G. |last1=Fink |author1-link=Donald G.

Another electromechanical instrument is the polarized-vane type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Manual of Electric Instruments Construction and Operating Principles |id=GET-1087A |publisher=General Electric, Meter and Instrument Department |place=Schenectady, New York |year=1949 |pages=66–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instrument a stationary field coil produces a rotating magnetic field, just like a polyphase motor. The field coils are connected either directly to polyphase voltage sources or to a phase-shifting reactor if a single-phase application.  A second stationary field coil, perpendicular to the voltage coils, carries a current proportional to current in one phase of the circuit. The moving system of the instrument consists of two vanes that are magnetized by the current coil. In operation the moving vanes take up a physical angle equivalent to the electrical angle between the voltage source and the current source. This type of instrument can be made to register for currents in both directions, giving a four-quadrant display of power factor or phase angle.

Digital instruments exist that directly measure the time lag between voltage and current waveforms. Low-cost instruments of this type measure the peak of the waveforms. More sophisticated versions measure the peak of the fundamental harmonic only, thus giving a more accurate reading for phase angle on distorted waveforms. Calculating power factor from voltage and current phases is only accurate if both waveforms are sinusoidal.&lt;ref name=ni_white_paper&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ni.com/white-paper/4278/en/|title=The Fundamentals of FFT-Based Signal Analysis and Measurement in LabVIEW and LabWindows/CVI|work=National Instruments Corporation|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Power Quality Analyzers, often referred to as Power Analyzers, make a digital recording of the voltage and current waveform (typically either one phase or three phase) and accurately calculate true power (watts), apparent power (VA) power factor, AC voltage, AC current, DC voltage, DC current, frequency, IEC61000-3-2/3-12 Harmonic measurement, IEC61000-3-3/3-11 flicker measurement, individual phase voltages in delta applications where there is no neutral line, total harmonic distortion, phase and amplitude of individual voltage or current harmonics, etc.&lt;ref name=Yokogawa_WT3000E&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yokogawa.co.jp/ftp/dist/ks/catalog/en/BUWT3000E-01EN_020.pdf|title=WT3000E Series Precision Power Analyzers|work=Yokogawa Corporation|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fluke_1760&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdn.testequity.com/documents/pdf/1760-ds.pdf|title=Fluke 1760 Three-Phase Power Quality Recorder |work=Fluke Corporation|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mnemonics ==
English-language power engineering students are advised to remember:
"ELI the ICE man" or "ELI on ICE" – the voltage E leads the current I in an inductor L; the current leads the voltage in a capacitor C.

Another common mnemonic is CIVIL – in a capacitor (C) the current (I) leads voltage (V), voltage (V) leads current (I) in an inductor (L).

The '''prisoner's dilemma''' is a standard example of a game analyzed in [[game theory]] that shows why two completely [[Rationality#Economics|rational]] individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so. It was originally framed by [[Merrill Flood]] and [[Melvin Dresher]] while working at [[RAND Corporation|RAND]] in 1950. [[Albert W. Tucker]] formalized the game with prison sentence rewards and named it "prisoner's dilemma",&lt;ref&gt;Poundstone, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; presenting it as follows:

{{quote|Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge, but they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The offer is:
* If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves two years in prison
* If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve three years in prison (and vice versa)
* If A and B both remain silent, both of them will only serve one year in prison (on the lesser charge).}}

It is implied that the prisoners will have no opportunity to reward or punish their partner other than the prison sentences they get and that their decision will not affect their reputation in the future. Because betraying a partner offers a greater reward than cooperating with them, all purely rational self-interested prisoners will betray the other, meaning the only possible outcome for two purely rational prisoners is for them to betray each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Milovsky|first=Nicholas|title=The Basics of Game Theory and Associated Games|url=http://issuu.com/johnsonnick895/docs/game_theory_paper|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The interesting part of this result is that pursuing individual reward logically leads both of the prisoners to betray when they would get a better reward if they both kept silent. In reality, humans display a [[systemic bias]] towards cooperative behavior in this and similar games despite what is predicted by simple models of "rational" self-interested action.&lt;ref name = Fehr&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fehr | first1= Ernst | last2=Fischbacher | first2=Urs   | date= Oct 23, 2003 | title=The Nature of human altruism |journal=Nature | volume=425 | pages=785–91 | publisher=Nature Publishing Group| doi=10.1038/nature02043 | url=http://www.iwp.jku.at/born/mpwfst/04/nature02043_f_born.pdf | accessdate=February 27, 2013 | pmid=14574401 | issue=6960|bibcode = 2003Natur.425..785F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Amos&gt;{{cite book | title=Preference, belief, and similarity: selected writings. | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press | first1= Amos | last1=Tversky | first2=Eldar | last2=Shafir | url=http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/PAPER-SUGGESTIONS/Preference,%20Belief,%20and%20Similarity%20Selected%20Writings%20(Bradford%20Books).pdf  | year=2004 | isbn=9780262700931 | accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahn"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Toh-Kyeong|first1 = Ahn|last2 = Ostrom|first2 = Elinor|last3 = Walker|first3 = James|date = Sep 5, 2002|title = Incorporating Motivational Heterogeneity into Game-Theoretic Models of Collective Action|journal = Public Choice|volume = 117|issue = 3–4|pages = 295–314|publisher = |doi =10.1023/b:puch.0000003739.54365.fd |url = http://www.indiana.edu/~workshop/seminars/papers/ahnostromwalker_092402.pdf|accessdate = June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hessel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Oosterbeek|first1 = Hessel|last2 = Sloof|first2 = Randolph|last3 = Van de Kuilen|first3 = Gus|date = Dec 3, 2003|title = Cultural Differences in Ultimatum Game Experiments: Evidence from a Meta-Analysis|journal = Experimental Economics|volume = 7|issue = 2|pages = 171–88|publisher = Springer Science and Business Media B.V|doi = 10.1023/B:EXEC.0000026978.14316.74|url = http://www.econ.nagoya-cu.ac.jp/~yhamagu/ultimatum.pdf|accessdate = February 27, 2013|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130512175243/http://www.econ.nagoya-cu.ac.jp/~yhamagu/ultimatum.pdf|archivedate = May 12, 2013|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extended "iterated" version of the game also exists. In this version, the classic game is played repeatedly between the same prisoners, who continuously have the opportunity to penalize the other for previous decisions. If the number of times the game will be played is known to the players, then (by [[backward induction]]) two classically rational players will betray each other repeatedly, for the same reasons as the single-shot variant. In an infinite or unknown length game there is no fixed optimum strategy, and prisoner's dilemma tournaments have been held to compete and test algorithms for such cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://egtheory.wordpress.com/2015/03/02/ipd/|title = Short history of iterated prisoner's dilemma tournaments|date = March 2, 2015|access-date = February 8, 2016|website = Theory, Evolution, and Games Group|publisher = |last = Kaznatcheev|first = Artem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prisoner's dilemma game can be used as a model for many [[#Real-life examples|real world situations]] involving cooperative behavior. In casual usage, the label "prisoner's dilemma" may be applied to situations not strictly matching the formal criteria of the classic or iterative games: for instance, those in which two entities could gain important benefits from cooperating or suffer from the failure to do so, but find it difficult or expensive—not necessarily impossible—to coordinate their activities.

==Strategy for the prisoner's dilemma==

Two prisoners are separated into individual rooms and cannot communicate with each other.
The normal game is shown below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! {{diagonal split header|&lt;br /&gt;Prisoner A|Prisoner B}} !! Prisoner B stays silent&lt;br&gt;(''cooperates'') !! Prisoner B betrays&lt;br&gt;(''defects'')
|-
! Prisoner A stays silent&lt;br&gt;(''cooperates'')
| Each serves 1 year|| Prisoner A: 3 years&lt;br /&gt;Prisoner B: goes free
|-
! Prisoner A betrays&lt;br&gt;(''defects'')
| Prisoner A: goes free&lt;br /&gt;Prisoner B: 3 years || Each serves 2 years
|}

It is assumed that both prisoners understand the nature of the game, have no loyalty to each other, and will have no opportunity for retribution or reward outside the game. Regardless of what the other decides, each prisoner gets a higher reward by betraying the other ("defecting"). The reasoning involves an argument by [[Dilemma#Use in logic|dilemma]]: B will either cooperate or defect. If B cooperates, A should defect, because going free is better than serving 1 year. If B defects, A should also defect, because serving 2 years is better than serving 3. So either way, A should defect. Parallel reasoning will show that B should defect.

Because defection always results in a better payoff than cooperation regardless of the other player's choice, it is a [[dominant strategy]]. Mutual defection is the only strong [[Nash equilibrium]] in the game (i.e. the only outcome from which each player could only do worse by unilaterally changing strategy). The dilemma, then, is that mutual cooperation yields a better outcome than mutual defection but is not the rational outcome because the choice to cooperate, from a self-interested perspective, is irrational.

==Generalized form==
The structure of the traditional Prisoner's Dilemma can be generalized from its original prisoner setting. Suppose that the two players are represented by the colors, red and blue, and that each player chooses to either "Cooperate" or "Defect".

If both players cooperate, they both receive the reward ''R'' for cooperating. If both players defect, they both receive the punishment payoff ''P''. If Blue defects while Red cooperates, then Blue receives the temptation payoff ''T'', while Red receives the "sucker's" payoff, ''S''. Similarly, if Blue cooperates while Red defects, then Blue receives the sucker's payoff ''S'', while Red receives the temptation payoff ''T''.

This can be expressed in [[Normal-form game|normal form]]:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+ Canonical PD payoff matrix
! {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|Blue}}|{{color|#900|Red}}}}
! scope="col" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#900|Cooperate}}
! scope="col" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#900|Defect}}
|-
! scope="row" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#009|Cooperate}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''R''}}|{{color|#900|''R''}}|transparent}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''S''}}|{{color|#900|''T''}}|transparent}}
|-
! scope="row" | {{color|#009|Defect}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''T''}}|{{color|#900|''S''}}|transparent}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''P''}}|{{color|#900|''P''}}|transparent}}
|}

and to be a prisoner's dilemma game in the strong sense, the following condition must hold for the payoffs:

:''T'' &gt; ''R'' &gt; ''P'' &gt; ''S''

The payoff relationship ''R'' &gt; ''P'' implies that mutual cooperation is superior to mutual defection, while the payoff relationships ''T'' &gt; ''R'' and ''P'' &gt; ''S'' imply that defection is the [[dominant strategy]] for both agents.

===Special case: Donation game===
The "donation game"&lt;ref name=Hilbe2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilbe|first=Christian |author2=Martin A. Nowak |author3=Karl Sigmund|title=Evolution of extortion in Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma games|journal=PNAS|date=April 2013|volume=110|issue=17|pages=6913–18|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/17/6913.abstract|accessdate=25 November 2013|doi=10.1073/pnas.1214834110|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.6913H |arxiv=1212.1067}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a form of prisoner's dilemma in which cooperation corresponds to offering the other player a benefit ''b'' at a personal cost ''c'' with ''b'' &gt; ''c''. Defection means offering nothing. The payoff matrix is thus

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
! {{diagonal split header|{{navy (color)|Blue}}|{{color|#900|Red}}}}
! scope="col" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#900|Cooperate}}
! scope="col" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#900|Defect}}
|-
! scope="row" style="width:60px;" | {{color|#009|Cooperate}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''b''-''c''}}|{{color|#900|''b''-''c''}}|transparent}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|-''c''}}|{{color|#900|''b''}}|transparent}}
|-
! scope="row" | {{color|#009|Defect}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|''b''}}|{{color|#900|-''c''}}|transparent}}
| {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|0}}|{{color|#900|0}}|transparent}}
|}

Note that {{tmath|2R&gt;T+S}} (i.e. {{tmath|2(b-c)&gt;b-c}}) which qualifies the donation game to be an iterated game (see next section).

The donation game may be applied to markets. Suppose X grows oranges, Y grows apples. The [[marginal utility]] of an apple to the orange-grower X is ''b'', which is higher than the marginal utility (''c'') of an orange, since X has a surplus of oranges and no apples. Similarly, for apple-grower Y, the marginal utility of an orange is ''b'' while the marginal utility of an apple is ''c''. If X and Y contract to exchange an apple and an orange, and each fulfills their end of the deal, then each receive a payoff of ''b''-''c''. If one "defects" and does not deliver as promised, the defector will receive a payoff of ''b'', while the cooperator will lose ''c''. If both defect, then neither one gains or loses anything.

==The iterated prisoner's dilemma==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2012}}
If two players play prisoner's dilemma more than once in succession and they remember previous actions of their opponent and change their strategy accordingly, the game is called iterated prisoner's dilemma.

In addition to the general form above, the iterative version also requires that 2''R'' &gt; ''T'' + ''S,'' to prevent alternating cooperation and defection giving a greater reward than mutual cooperation.

The iterated prisoner's dilemma game is fundamental to some theories of human cooperation and trust. On the assumption that the game can model transactions between two people requiring trust, cooperative behaviour in populations may be modeled by a multi-player, iterated, version of the game. It has, consequently, fascinated many scholars over the years. In 1975, Grofman and Pool estimated the count of scholarly articles devoted to it at over 2,000. The iterated prisoner's dilemma has also been referred to as the "[[Peace war game|Peace-War game]]".&lt;ref name = Shy&gt;{{cite book | title= Industrial Organization: Theory and Applications | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press | first1= Oz | last1=Shy |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tr4CjJ5LlRcC&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=industrial+organization+theory+and+applications  | year=1995 | isbn=0262193663 | accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the game is played exactly ''N'' times and both players know this, then it is optimal to defect in all rounds. The only possible [[Nash equilibrium]] is to always defect. The proof is [[Mathematical induction|inductive]]: one might as well defect on the last turn, since the opponent will not have a chance to later retaliate. Therefore, both will defect on the last turn. Thus, the player might as well defect on the second-to-last turn, since the opponent will defect on the last no matter what is done, and so on.  The same applies if the game length is unknown but has a known upper limit.

Unlike the standard prisoner's dilemma, in the iterated prisoner's dilemma the defection strategy is counter-intuitive and fails badly to predict the behavior of human players. Within standard economic theory, though, this is the only correct answer.  The [[superrational]] strategy in the iterated prisoner's dilemma with fixed ''N'' is to cooperate against a superrational opponent, and in the limit of large ''N'', experimental results on strategies agree with the superrational version, not the game-theoretic rational one.

For cooperation to emerge between game theoretic rational players, the total number of rounds ''N'' must be unknown to the players. In this case 'always defect' may no longer be a strictly dominant strategy, only a Nash equilibrium. Amongst results shown by [[Robert Aumann]] in a 1959 paper, rational players repeatedly interacting for indefinitely long games can sustain the cooperative outcome.

===Strategy for the iterated prisoner's dilemma===
Interest in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) was kindled by [[Robert Axelrod]] in his book ''[[The Evolution of Cooperation]]'' (1984). In it he reports on a tournament he organized of the ''N'' step prisoner's dilemma (with ''N'' fixed) in which participants have to choose their mutual strategy again and again, and have memory of their previous encounters. Axelrod invited academic colleagues all over the world to devise computer strategies to compete in an IPD tournament. The programs that were entered varied widely in algorithmic complexity, initial hostility, capacity for forgiveness, and so forth.

Axelrod discovered that when these encounters were repeated over a long period of time with many players, each with different strategies, greedy strategies tended to do very poorly in the long run while more [[altruism|altruistic]] strategies did better, as judged purely by self-interest. He used this to show a possible mechanism for the evolution of altruistic behaviour from mechanisms that are initially purely selfish, by [[natural selection]].

The winning [[deterministic algorithm|deterministic]] strategy was [[tit for tat]], which [[Anatol Rapoport]] developed and entered into the tournament. It was the simplest of any program entered, containing only four lines of [[BASIC]], and won the contest. The strategy is simply to cooperate on the first iteration of the game; after that, the player does what his or her opponent did on the previous move. Depending on the situation, a slightly better strategy can be "tit for tat with forgiveness". When the opponent defects, on the next move, the player sometimes cooperates anyway, with a small probability (around 1–5%). This allows for occasional recovery from getting trapped in a cycle of defections. The exact probability depends on the line-up of opponents.

By analysing the top-scoring strategies, Axelrod stated several conditions necessary for a strategy to be successful.

; Nice: The most important condition is that the strategy must be "nice", that is, it will not defect before its opponent does (this is sometimes referred to as an "optimistic" algorithm). Almost all of the top-scoring strategies were nice; therefore, a purely selfish strategy will not "cheat" on its opponent, for purely self-interested reasons first.
; Retaliating: However, Axelrod contended, the successful strategy must not be a blind optimist. It must sometimes retaliate. An example of a non-retaliating strategy is Always Cooperate. This is a very bad choice, as "nasty" strategies will ruthlessly exploit such players.
; Forgiving: Successful strategies must also be forgiving. Though players will retaliate, they will once again fall back to cooperating if the opponent does not continue to defect. This stops long runs of revenge and counter-revenge, maximizing points.
; Non-envious: The last quality is being non-envious, that is not striving to score more than the opponent.

The optimal (points-maximizing) strategy for the one-time PD game is simply defection; as explained above, this is true whatever the composition of opponents may be. However, in the iterated-PD game the optimal strategy depends upon the strategies of likely opponents, and how they will react to defections and cooperations. For example, consider a population where everyone defects every time, except for a single individual following the tit for tat strategy. That individual is at a slight disadvantage because of the loss on the first turn. In such a population, the optimal strategy for that individual is to defect every time. In a population with a certain percentage of always-defectors and the rest being tit for tat players, the optimal strategy for an individual depends on the percentage, and on the length of the game.

In the strategy called Pavlov, [[win-stay, lose-switch]], faced with a failure to cooperate, the player switches strategy the next turn.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/93/7/2686.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In certain circumstances,{{specify|date=November 2012}} Pavlov beats all other strategies by giving preferential treatment to co-players using a similar strategy.

Deriving the optimal strategy is generally done in two ways:
# [[Bayesian Nash equilibrium|Bayesian Nash Equilibrium]]: If the statistical distribution of opposing strategies can be determined (e.g. 50% tit for tat, 50% always cooperate) an optimal counter-strategy can be derived analytically.&lt;ref name="bne"&gt;For example see the 2003 study [http://econ.hevra.haifa.ac.il/~mbengad/seminars/whole1.pdf  "Bayesian Nash equilibrium; a statistical test of the hypothesis"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051002195142/http://econ.hevra.haifa.ac.il/~mbengad/seminars/whole1.pdf |date=2005-10-02 }} for discussion of the concept and whether it can apply in real [[economic]] or strategic situations (from [[Tel Aviv University]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulations of populations have been made, where individuals with low scores die off, and those with high scores reproduce (a [[genetic algorithm]] for finding an optimal strategy). The mix of algorithms in the final population generally depends on the mix in the initial population. The introduction of mutation (random variation during reproduction) lessens the dependency on the initial population; empirical experiments with such systems tend to produce tit for tat players (see for instance Chess 1988),{{Clarify|date=August 2016}} but no analytic proof exists that this will always occur.

Although tit for tat is considered to be the most [[robust]] basic strategy, a team from [[Southampton University]] in England (led by [[Nick Jennings (computer scientist)|Professor Nicholas Jennings]] and consisting of Rajdeep Dash, Sarvapali Ramchurn, Alex Rogers, Perukrishnen Vytelingum) introduced a new strategy at the 20th-anniversary iterated prisoner's dilemma competition, which proved to be more successful than tit for tat. This strategy relied on collusion between programs to achieve the highest number of points for a single program. The university submitted 60 programs to the competition, which were designed to recognize each other through a series of five to ten moves at the start.&lt;ref name="southamptonstrategy"&gt;[http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2004/oct/04_151.shtml : University of Southampton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421055745/http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2004/oct/04_151.shtml |date=2014-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once this recognition was made, one program would always cooperate and the other would always defect, assuring the maximum number of points for the defector. If the program realized that it was playing a non-Southampton player, it would continuously defect in an attempt to minimize the score of the competing program. As a result,&lt;ref name="southamptontrick"&gt;[http://www.prisoners-dilemma.com/results/cec04/ipd_cec04_full_run.html The 2004 Prisoners' Dilemma Tournament Results] show [[University of Southampton]]'s strategies in the first three places, despite having fewer wins and many more losses than the GRIM strategy. (Note that in a PD tournament, the aim of the game is not to "win" matches&amp;nbsp;– that can easily be achieved by frequent defection). It should also be pointed out that even without implicit collusion between [[computer program|software strategies]] (exploited by the Southampton team) tit for tat is not always the absolute winner of any given tournament; it would be more precise to say that its long run results over a series of tournaments outperform its rivals. (In any one event a given strategy can be slightly better adjusted to the competition than tit for tat, but tit for tat is more robust). The same applies for the tit for tat with forgiveness variant, and other optimal strategies: on any given day they might not 'win' against a specific mix of counter-strategies. An alternative way of putting it is using the Darwinian [[Evolutionarily stable strategy|ESS]] simulation. In such a simulation, tit for tat will almost always come to dominate, though nasty strategies will drift in and out of the population because a tit for tat population is penetrable by non-retaliating nice strategies, which in turn are easy prey for the nasty strategies. Richard Dawkins showed that here, no static mix of strategies form a stable equilibrium and the system will always oscillate between bounds.&lt;/ref&gt; this strategy ended up taking the top three positions in the competition, as well as a number of positions towards the bottom.

This strategy takes advantage of the fact that multiple entries were allowed in this particular competition and that the performance of a team was measured by that of the highest-scoring player (meaning that the use of self-sacrificing players was a form of [[minmaxing]]). In a competition where one has control of only a single player, tit for tat is certainly a better strategy. Because of this new rule, this competition also has little theoretical significance when analysing single agent strategies as compared to Axelrod's seminal tournament. However, it provided a basis for analysing how to achieve cooperative strategies in multi-agent frameworks, especially in the presence of noise. In fact, long before this new-rules tournament was played, [[Richard Dawkins]] in his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' pointed out the possibility of such strategies winning if multiple entries were allowed, but he remarked that most probably Axelrod would not have allowed them if they had been submitted. It also relies on circumventing rules about the prisoner's dilemma in that there is no communication allowed between the two players, which the Southampton programs arguably did with their opening "ten move dance" to recognize one another; this only reinforces just how valuable communication can be in shifting the balance of the game.

===Stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma===

In a stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma game, strategies are specified by in terms of "cooperation probabilities".&lt;ref name=Press2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Press|first1=WH|last2=Dyson|first2=FJ|title=Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma contains strategies that dominate any evolutionary opponent|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|date=26 June 2012|volume=109|issue=26|pages=10409–13|doi=10.1073/pnas.1206569109|pmid=22615375|pmc=3387070|bibcode=2012PNAS..10910409P}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an encounter between player ''X'' and player ''Y'', ''X'' 's strategy is specified by a set of probabilities ''P'' of cooperating with ''Y''. ''P'' is a function of the outcomes of their previous encounters or some subset thereof. If ''P'' is a function of only their most recent ''n'' encounters, it is called a "memory-n" strategy. A memory-1 strategy is then specified by four cooperation probabilities:  &lt;math&gt;P=\{P_{cc},P_{cd},P_{dc},P_{dd}\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that ''X'' will cooperate in the present encounter given that the previous encounter was characterized by (ab). For example, if the previous encounter was one in which ''X'' cooperated and ''Y'' defected, then &lt;math&gt;P_{cd}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that ''X'' will cooperate in the present encounter. If each of the probabilities are either 1 or 0, the strategy is called deterministic. An example of a deterministic strategy is the "[[tit for tat]]" strategy written as ''P''={1,0,1,0}, in which ''X'' responds as ''Y'' did in the previous encounter. Another is the [[win–stay, lose–switch]] strategy written as ''P''={1,0,0,1}, in which ''X'' responds as in the previous encounter, if it was a "win" (i.e. cc or dc) but changes strategy if it was a loss (i.e. cd or dd). It has been shown that for any memory-n strategy there is a corresponding memory-1 strategy which gives the same statistical results, so that only memory-1 strategies need be considered.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt;

If we define ''P'' as the above 4-element strategy vector of ''X'' and &lt;math&gt;Q=\{Q_{cc},Q_{cd},Q_{dc},Q_{dd}\}&lt;/math&gt; as the 4-element strategy vector of ''Y'', a transition matrix ''M'' may be defined for ''X'' whose ''ij'' th entry is the probability that the outcome of a particular encounter between ''X'' and ''Y'' will be ''j'' given that the previous encounter was ''i'', where ''i'' and ''j'' are one of the four outcome indices: ''cc'', ''cd'', ''dc'', or ''dd''. For example, from ''X'' 's point of view, the probability that the outcome of the present encounter is ''cd'' given that the previous encounter was ''cd'' is equal to &lt;math&gt;M_{cd,cd}=P_{cd}(1-Q_{dc})&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that the indices for ''Q'' are from ''Y'' 's point of view: a ''cd'' outcome for ''X'' is a ''dc'' outcome for ''Y''.)  Under these definitions, the iterated prisoner's dilemma qualifies as a [[stochastic process]] and ''M'' is a [[stochastic matrix]], allowing all of the theory of stochastic processes to be applied.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt;

One result of stochastic theory is that there exists a stationary vector ''v'' for the matrix ''M'' such that &lt;math&gt;v\cdot M=v&lt;/math&gt;. Without loss of generality, it may be specified that ''v'' is normalized so that the sum of its four components is unity. The ''ij'' th entry in &lt;math&gt;M^n&lt;/math&gt; will give the probability that the outcome of an encounter between ''X'' and ''Y'' will be ''j'' given that the encounter ''n'' steps previous is ''i''. In the limit as ''n'' approaches infinity, ''M'' will converge to a matrix with fixed values, giving the long-term probabilities of an encounter producing ''j'' which will be independent of ''i''. In other words, the rows of &lt;math&gt;M^\infty&lt;/math&gt; will be identical, giving the long-term equilibrium result probabilities of the iterated prisoners dilemma without the need to explicitly evaluate a large number of interactions. It can be seen that ''v'' is a stationary vector for &lt;math&gt;M^n&lt;/math&gt; and particularly &lt;math&gt;M^\infty&lt;/math&gt;, so that each row of &lt;math&gt;M^\infty&lt;/math&gt; will be equal to ''v''. Thus the stationary vector specifies the equilibrium outcome probabilities for ''X''. Defining &lt;math&gt;S_x=\{R,S,T,P\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_y=\{R,T,S,P\}&lt;/math&gt; as the short-term payoff vectors for the {cc,cd,dc,dd} outcomes (From ''X'' 's point of view), the equilibrium payoffs for ''X'' and ''Y'' can now be specified as &lt;math&gt;s_x=v\cdot S_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_y=v\cdot S_y&lt;/math&gt;, allowing the two strategies ''P'' and ''Q'' to be compared for their long term payoffs.

====Zero-determinant strategies====

[[File:IPD Venn.svg|right|thumb|600px|The relationship between zero-determinant (ZD), cooperating and defecting strategies in the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD) illustrated in a [[Venn diagram]]. Cooperating strategies always cooperate with other cooperating strategies, and defecting strategies always defect against other defecting strategies. Both contain subsets of strategies that are robust under strong selection, meaning no other memory-1 strategy is selected to invade such strategies when they are resident in a population. Only cooperating strategies contain a subset that are always robust, meaning that no other memory-1 strategy is selected to invade and replace such strategies, under both strong and [[weak selection]]. The intersection between ZD and good cooperating strategies is the set of generous ZD strategies. Extortion strategies are the intersection between ZD and non-robust defecting strategies. Tit-for-tat lies at the intersection of cooperating, defecting and ZD strategies.]]

In 2012, [[William H. Press]] and [[Freeman Dyson]] published a new class of strategies for the stochastic iterated prisoner's dilemma called "zero-determinant" (ZD) strategies.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt; The long term payoffs for encounters between ''X'' and ''Y'' can be expressed as the determinant of a matrix which is a function of the two strategies and the short term payoff vectors: &lt;math&gt;s_x=D(P,Q,S_x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_y=D(P,Q,S_y)&lt;/math&gt;, which do not involve the stationary vector ''v''. Since the determinant function &lt;math&gt;s_y=D(P,Q,f)&lt;/math&gt; is linear in ''f'', it follows that &lt;math&gt;\alpha s_x+\beta s_y+\gamma=D(P,Q,\alpha S_x+\beta S_y+\gamma U)&lt;/math&gt; (where ''U''={1,1,1,1}). Any strategies for which &lt;math&gt;D(P,Q,\alpha S_x+\beta S_y+\gamma U)=0&lt;/math&gt; is by definition a ZD strategy, and the long term payoffs obey the relation  &lt;math&gt;\alpha s_x+\beta s_y+\gamma=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Tit-for-tat is a ZD strategy which is "fair" in the sense of not gaining advantage over the other player. However, the ZD space also contains strategies that, in the case of two players, can allow one player to unilaterally set the other player's score or alternatively, force an evolutionary player to achieve a payoff some percentage lower than his own. The extorted player could defect but would thereby hurt himself by getting lower payoff. Thus, extortion solutions turn the iterated prisoner's dilemma into a sort of [[ultimatum game]]. Specifically, ''X'' is able to choose a strategy for which &lt;math&gt;D(P,Q,\beta S_y+\gamma U)=0&lt;/math&gt;, unilaterally setting &lt;math&gt;s_y&lt;/math&gt;  to a specific value within a particular range of values, independent of ''Y'' 's strategy, offering an opportunity for ''X'' to "extort" player ''Y'' (and vice versa). (It turns out that if ''X'' tries to set &lt;math&gt;s_x&lt;/math&gt; to a particular value, the range of possibilities is much smaller, only consisting of complete cooperation or complete defection.&lt;ref name="Press2012"/&gt;)

An extension of the IPD is an evolutionary stochastic IPD, in which the relative abundance of particular strategies is allowed to change, with more successful strategies relatively increasing. This process may be accomplished by having less successful players imitate the more successful strategies, or by eliminating less successful players from the game, while multiplying the more successful ones. It has been shown that unfair ZD strategies are not [[evolutionarily stable strategy|evolutionarily stable]]. The key intuition is that an evolutionarily stable strategy must not only be able to invade another population (which extortionary ZD strategies can do) but must also perform well against other players of the same type (which extortionary ZD players do poorly, because they reduce each other's surplus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adami|first=Christoph|author2=Arend Hintze|title=Evolutionary instability of Zero Determinant strategies demonstrates that winning isn't everything|year=2013|page=3|arxiv=1208.2666|doi=10.1038/ncomms3193|bibcode=2013NatCo...4E2193A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theory and simulations confirm that beyond a critical population size, ZD extortion loses out in evolutionary competition against more cooperative strategies, and as a result, the average payoff in the population increases when the population is bigger. In addition, there are some cases in which extortioners may even catalyze cooperation by helping to break out of a face-off between uniform defectors and [[win–stay, lose–switch]] agents.&lt;ref name=Hilbe2013 /&gt;

While extortionary ZD strategies are not stable in large populations, another ZD class called "generous" strategies ''is'' both stable and robust.  In fact, when the population is not too small, these strategies can supplant any other ZD strategy and even perform well against a broad array of generic strategies for iterated prisoner's dilemma, including win–stay, lose–switch. This was proven specifically for the [[Prisoner's dilemma#Special case: Donation game|donation game]] by Alexander Stewart and Joshua Plotkin in 2013.&lt;ref name=Stewart2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Alexander J.|author2=Joshua B. Plotkin|title=From extortion to generosity, evolution in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|year=2013|doi=10.1073/pnas.1306246110|volume=110|issue=38|pages=15348–53|bibcode=2013PNAS..11015348S|pmc=3780848}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generous strategies will cooperate with other cooperative players, and in the face of defection, the generous player loses more utility than its rival. Generous strategies are the intersection of ZD strategies and so-called "good" strategies, which were defined by Akin (2013)&lt;ref name=Akin2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akin|first=Ethan|title=Stable Cooperative Solutions for the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma|year=2013|page=9|arxiv=1211.0969|bibcode=2012arXiv1211.0969A}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be those for which the player responds to past mutual cooperation with future cooperation and splits expected payoffs equally if he receives at least the cooperative expected payoff. Among good strategies, the generous (ZD) subset performs well when the population is not too small. If the population is very small, defection strategies tend to dominate.&lt;ref name=Stewart2013 /&gt;

===Continuous iterated prisoner's dilemma===
Most work on the iterated prisoner's dilemma has focused on the discrete case, in which players either cooperate or defect, because this model is relatively simple to analyze. However, some researchers have looked at models of the continuous iterated prisoner's dilemma, in which players are able to make a variable contribution to the other player. Le and Boyd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Le | first1 = S. | last2 = Boyd | first2 = R. |name-list-format=vanc| year = 2007 | title = Evolutionary Dynamics of the Continuous Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 245 | issue = 2| pages = 258–67 | doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.09.016 | pmid = 17125798 }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that in such situations, cooperation is much harder to evolve than in the discrete iterated prisoner's dilemma. The basic intuition for this result is straightforward: in a continuous prisoner's dilemma, if a population starts off in a non-cooperative equilibrium, players who are only marginally more cooperative than non-cooperators get little benefit from [[assorting]] with one another. By contrast, in a discrete prisoner's dilemma, tit for tat cooperators get a big payoff boost from assorting with one another in a non-cooperative equilibrium, relative to non-cooperators. Since nature arguably offers more opportunities for variable cooperation rather than a strict dichotomy of cooperation or defection, the continuous prisoner's dilemma may help explain why real-life examples of tit for tat-like cooperation are extremely rare in nature (ex. Hammerstein&lt;ref&gt;Hammerstein, P. (2003). Why is reciprocity so rare in social animals? A protestant appeal. In: P. Hammerstein, Editor, Genetic and Cultural Evolution of Cooperation, MIT Press. pp. 83–94.
&lt;/ref&gt;) even though tit for tat seems robust in theoretical models.

===Emergence of stable strategies===
Players cannot seem to coordinate mutual cooperation, thus often get locked into the inferior yet stable strategy of defection.  In this way, iterated rounds facilitate the evolution of stable strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spaniel|first=William|title=Game Theory 101: The Complete Textbook|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iterated rounds often produce novel strategies, which have implications to complex social interaction. One such strategy is win-stay lose-shift. This strategy outperforms a simple Tit-For-Tat strategy&amp;nbsp;– that is, if you can get away with cheating, repeat that behavior, however if you get caught, switch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nowak|first=Martin|author2=Karl Sigmund|title=A strategy of win-stay, lose-shift that outperforms tit-for-tat in the Prisoner's Dilemma game|journal=Nature|year=1993|volume=364|issue=6432|doi=10.1038/364056a0|pages=56–58|pmid=8316296|bibcode=1993Natur.364...56N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only problem of this tit-for-tat strategy is that they are vulnerable to signal error. The problem arises when one individual shows cooperative behavior but the other interprets it as cheating. As a result of this, the second individual now cheats and then it starts a see-saw pattern of cheating in a chain reaction.

==Real-life examples==
The prisoner setting may seem contrived, but there are in fact many examples in human interaction as well as interactions in nature that have the same payoff matrix. The prisoner's dilemma is therefore of interest to the [[social science]]s such as [[economics]], [[politics]], and [[sociology]], as well as to the biological sciences such as [[ethology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]. Many natural processes have been abstracted into models in which living beings are engaged in endless games of prisoner's dilemma. This wide applicability of the PD gives the game its substantial importance.

===In environmental studies===
In [[environmental studies]], the PD is evident in crises such as global [[climate change|climate-change]]. It is argued all countries will benefit from a stable climate, but any single country is often hesitant to curb [[Carbon dioxide|{{Co2}}]] emissions. The immediate benefit to any one country from maintaining current behavior is wrongly perceived to be greater than the purported eventual benefit to that country if all countries' behavior was changed, therefore explaining the impasse concerning climate-change in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9867020|title=Markets &amp; Data|date=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important difference between climate-change politics and the prisoner's dilemma is uncertainty; the extent and pace at which pollution can change climate is not known. The dilemma faced by government is therefore different from the prisoner's dilemma in that the payoffs of cooperation are unknown. This difference suggests that states will cooperate much less than in a real iterated prisoner's dilemma, so that the probability of avoiding a possible climate catastrophe is much smaller than that suggested by a game-theoretical analysis of the situation using a real iterated prisoner's dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rehmeyer|first=Julie|title=Game theory suggests current climate negotiations won't avert catastrophe|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/game-theory-suggests-current-climate-negotiations-won%E2%80%99t-avert-catastrophe|work=Science News|publisher=Society for Science &amp; the Public|date=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osang and Nandy provide a theoretical explanation with proofs for a regulation-driven win-win situation along the
lines of [[Michael Porter]]'s hypothesis, in which government regulation of competing firms is substantial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.smu.edu/tosang/pdf/regln0803.pdf Osang and Nandy 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In animals===
Cooperative behavior of many animals can be understood as an example of the prisoner's dilemma. Often animals engage in long term partnerships, which can be more specifically modeled as iterated prisoner's dilemma. For example, [[guppy|guppies]] inspect predators cooperatively in groups, and they are thought to punish non-cooperative inspectors.

[[Vampire bats]] are social animals that engage in reciprocal food exchange. Applying the payoffs from the prisoner's dilemma can help explain this behavior:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=The Selfish Gene|year=1976|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* C/C: "Reward: I get blood on my unlucky nights, which saves me from starving. I have to give blood on my lucky nights, which doesn't cost me too much."
* D/C: "Temptation: You save my life on my poor night. But then I get the added benefit of not having to pay the slight cost of feeding you on my good night."
* C/D: "Sucker's Payoff: I pay the cost of saving your life on my good night. But on my bad night you don't feed me and I run a real risk of starving to death."
* D/D: "Punishment: I don't have to pay the slight costs of feeding you on my good nights. But I run a real risk of starving on my poor nights."

===In psychology===
In [[addiction]] research / [[behavioral economics]], [[George Ainslie (psychologist)|George Ainslie]] points out&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George|last=Ainslie |title=Breakdown of Will |year=2001 |isbn=0-521-59694-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that addiction can be cast as an intertemporal PD problem between the present and future selves of the addict.  In this case, ''defecting'' means ''relapsing'', and it is easy to see that not defecting both today and in the future is by far the best outcome. The case where one abstains today but relapses in the future is the worst outcome&amp;nbsp;– in some sense the discipline and self-sacrifice involved in abstaining today have been "wasted" because the future relapse means that the addict is right back where he started and will have to start over (which is quite demoralizing, and makes starting over more difficult).  Relapsing today and tomorrow is a slightly "better" outcome, because while the addict is still addicted, they haven't put the effort in to trying to stop. The final case, where one engages in the addictive behavior today while abstaining "tomorrow" will be familiar to anyone who has struggled with an addiction.  The problem here is that (as in other PDs) there is an obvious benefit to defecting "today", but tomorrow one will face the same PD, and the same obvious benefit will be present then, ultimately leading to an endless string of defections.

[[John Gottman]] in his research described in "the science of trust" defines good relationships as those where partners know not to enter the (D,D) cell or at least not to get dynamically stuck there in a loop.

===In economics===
Advertising is sometimes cited as a real-example of the prisoner’s dilemma.  When [[cigarette advertising]] was legal in the United States, competing cigarette manufacturers had to decide how much money to spend on advertising.  The effectiveness of Firm A’s advertising was partially determined by the advertising conducted by Firm B.  Likewise, the profit derived from advertising for Firm B is affected by the advertising conducted by Firm A.  If both Firm A and Firm B chose to advertise during a given period, then the advertising cancels out, receipts remain constant, and expenses increase due to the cost of advertising.  Both firms would benefit from a reduction in advertising.  However, should Firm B choose not to advertise, Firm A could benefit greatly by advertising. Nevertheless, the optimal amount of advertising by one firm depends on how much advertising the other undertakes. As the best strategy is dependent on what the other firm chooses there is no dominant strategy, which makes it slightly different from a prisoner's dilemma. The outcome is similar, though, in that both firms would be better off were they to advertise less than in the equilibrium. Sometimes cooperative behaviors do emerge in business situations.  For instance, cigarette manufacturers endorsed the making of laws banning cigarette advertising, understanding that this would reduce costs and increase profits across the industry.{{Citation needed|reason=This reference doesn't mention or support the claimed historical account.|date=December 2012}}&lt;ref name="trust"&gt;This argument for the development of cooperation through trust is given in '' [[The Wisdom of Crowds]] '', where it is argued that long-distance [[capitalism]] was able to form around a nucleus of [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], who always dealt honourably with their business partners. (Rather than defecting and reneging on promises&amp;nbsp;– a phenomenon that had discouraged earlier long-term unenforceable overseas contracts). It is argued that dealings with reliable merchants allowed the [[meme]] for cooperation to spread to other traders, who spread it further until a high degree of cooperation became a profitable strategy in general [[commerce]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This analysis is likely to be pertinent in many other business situations involving advertising.{{Citation needed|reason=This doesn't sound like cooperation|date=November 2012}}

Without enforceable agreements, members of a [[cartel]] are also involved in a (multi-player) prisoner's dilemma.&lt;ref name=NicholsonIntermediateMicroEd8&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Nicholson|year=2000|title=Intermediate Microeconomics|edition=8th|publisher=Harcourt}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Cooperating' typically means keeping prices at a pre-agreed minimum level. 'Defecting' means selling under this minimum level, instantly taking business (and profits) from other cartel members. [[Anti-trust]] authorities want potential cartel members to mutually defect, ensuring the lowest possible prices for [[consumer]]s.

===In sport===
[[Doping in sport]] has been cited as an example of a prisoner's dilemma.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schneier |first=Bruce |url=https://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/10/lance-armstrong-and-the-prisoners-dilemma-of-doping-in-professional-sports/ |title=Lance Armstrong and the Prisoners' Dilemma of Doping in Professional Sports &amp;#124; Wired Opinion |publisher=Wired.com |date=2012-10-26 |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two competing athletes have the option to use an illegal and/or dangerous drug to boost their performance. If neither athlete takes the drug, then neither gains an advantage. If only one does, then that athlete gains a significant advantage over their competitor, reduced by the legal and/or medical dangers of having taken the drug. If both athletes take the drug, however, the benefits cancel out and only the dangers remain, putting them both in a worse position than if neither had used doping.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;

===In international politics===
In [[international politics|international political theory]], the Prisoner's Dilemma is often used to demonstrate the coherence of [[strategic realism]], which holds that in international relations, all states (regardless of their internal policies or professed ideology), will act in their rational self-interest given [[anarchy (international relations)|international anarchy]]. A classic example is an arms race like the [[Cold War]] and similar conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0165489684900222 | title = Arms races as iterated prisoner's dilemma games | author = Stephen J. Majeski | journal = Mathematical and Social Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–66 | year = 1984 | doi=10.1016/0165-4896(84)90022-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Cold War the opposing alliances of [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] both had the choice to arm or disarm. From each side's point of view, disarming whilst their opponent continued to arm would have led to military inferiority and possible annihilation. Conversely, arming whilst their opponent disarmed would have led to superiority. If both sides chose to arm, neither could afford to attack the other, but both incurred the high cost of developing and maintaining a nuclear arsenal. If both sides chose to disarm, war would be avoided and there would be no costs.

Although the 'best' overall outcome is for both sides to disarm, the rational course for both sides is to arm, and this is indeed what happened. Both sides poured enormous resources into military research and armament in a [[War of attrition (game)|war of attrition]] for the next thirty years until the Soviet Union could not withstand the economic cost.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The same logic could be applied in any similar scenario, be it economic or technological competition between sovereign states.

===Multiplayer dilemmas===
Many real-life dilemmas involve multiple players.&lt;ref&gt;Gokhale CS, Traulsen A. Evolutionary games in the multiverse. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 2010 Mar 23. 107(12):5500–04.&lt;/ref&gt; Although metaphorical, [[Garrett Hardin|Hardin's]] [[tragedy of the commons]] may be viewed as an example of a multi-player generalization of the PD: Each villager makes a choice for personal gain or restraint. The collective reward for unanimous (or even frequent) defection is very low payoffs (representing the destruction of the "commons"). A commons dilemma most people can relate to is washing the dishes in a shared house.  By not washing dishes an individual can gain by saving his time, but if that behavior is adopted by every resident the collective cost is no clean plates for anyone.

The commons are not always exploited: [[William Poundstone]], in a book about the prisoner's dilemma (see References below), describes a situation in New Zealand where newspaper boxes are left unlocked. It is possible for people to [[Excludability|take a paper without paying]] (''defecting'') but very few do, feeling that if they do not pay then neither will others, destroying the system. Subsequent research by [[Elinor Ostrom]], winner of the 2009 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, hypothesized that the [[tragedy of the commons]] is oversimplified, with the negative outcome influenced by outside influences. Without complicating pressures, groups communicate and manage the commons among themselves for their mutual benefit, enforcing social norms to preserve the resource and achieve the maximum good for the group, an example of effecting the best case outcome for PD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volokh.com/2009/10/12/elinor-ostrom-and-the-tragedy-of-the-commons/ |title=The Volokh Conspiracy " Elinor Ostrom and the Tragedy of the Commons |publisher=Volokh.com |date=2009-10-12 |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Friend or Foe?''===
''[[Friend or Foe? (TV series)|Friend or Foe?]]'' is a game show that aired from 2002 to 2005 on the [[Game Show Network]] in the US.  It is an example of the prisoner's dilemma game tested on real people, but in an artificial setting. On the game show, three pairs of people compete. When a pair is eliminated, they play a game similar to the prisoner's dilemma to determine how the winnings are split. If they both cooperate (Friend), they share the winnings 50–50. If one cooperates and the other defects (Foe), the defector gets all the winnings and the cooperator gets nothing. If both defect, both leave with nothing. Notice that the reward matrix is slightly different from the standard one given above, as the rewards for the "both defect" and the "cooperate while the opponent defects" cases are identical. This makes the "both defect" case a weak equilibrium, compared with being a strict equilibrium in the standard prisoner's dilemma. If a contestant knows that their opponent is going to vote "Foe", then their own choice does not affect their own winnings. In a specific sense, ''Friend or Foe'' has a rewards model between prisoner's dilemma and the [[Chicken (game)|game of Chicken]].

The rewards matrix is
{| class="wikitable"
! {{diagonal split header|{{color|#009|Pair 1}}|{{color|#900|Pair 2}}}}

|}

This payoff matrix has also been used on the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television]] programmes ''Trust Me'', ''[[Shafted]]'', ''[[The Bank Job (TV series)|The Bank Job]]'' and ''[[Golden Balls]]'', and on the [[United States|American]] shows ''[[Bachelor Pad]]'' and ''[[Take It All (game show)|Take It All]]''. Game data from the ''[[Golden Balls]]'' series has been analyzed by a team of economists, who found that cooperation was "surprisingly high" for amounts of money that would seem consequential in the real world, but were comparatively low in the context of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | ssrn=1592456 | title=Split or Steal?

===Iterated snowdrift===
Researchers from the [[University of Lausanne]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]] have suggested that the "Iterated Snowdrift Game" may more closely reflect real-world social situations. Although this model is actually a [[chicken game]], it will be described here. In this model, the risk of being exploited through defection is lower, and individuals always gain from taking the cooperative choice. The snowdrift game imagines two drivers who are stuck on opposite sides of a [[snowdrift]], each of whom is given the option of shoveling snow to clear a path, or remaining in their car. A player's highest payoff comes from leaving the opponent to clear all the snow by themselves, but the opponent is still nominally rewarded for their work.

This may better reflect real world scenarios, the researchers giving the example of two scientists collaborating on a report, both of whom would benefit if the other worked harder. "But when your collaborator doesn’t do any work, it’s probably better for you to do all the work yourself. You’ll still end up with a completed project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kümmerli|first=Rolf|title='Snowdrift' game tops 'Prisoner's Dilemma' in explaining cooperation|url=http://phys.org/news111145481.html|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==

Several software packages have been created to run prisoner's dilemma simulations and tournaments, some of which have available source code.

==In fiction==
[[Hannu Rajaniemi]] set the opening scene of his ''[[The Quantum Thief]]'' trilogy in a "dilemma prison". The main theme of the series has been described as the "inadequacy of a binary universe" and the ultimate antagonist is a character called the All-Defector.  Rajaniemi is particularly interesting as an artist treating this subject in that he is a Cambridge-trained mathematician and holds a PhD in [[mathematical physics]]&amp;nbsp;– the interchangeability of matter and information is a major feature of the books, which take place in a "post-singularity" future.  The first book in the series was published in 2010, with the two sequels, ''[[The Fractal Prince]]'' and ''[[The Causal Angel]]'', published in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

A game modeled after the (iterated) prisoner's dilemma is a central focus of the 2012 video game ''[[Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward]]'' and a minor part in its 2016 sequel ''[[Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma]]''.

In ''The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Prisoner's Dilemma'' by [[Trenton Lee Stewart]], the main characters start by playing a version of the game and escaping from the "prison" altogether. Later they become actual prisoners and escape once again.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6654">In [[telecommunications]], '''return loss''' is the loss of [[power (physics)|power]] in the [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] returned/reflected by a discontinuity in a [[transmission line]] or [[optical fiber]].  This discontinuity can be a mismatch with the terminating load or with a device inserted in the line.  It is usually expressed as a ratio in [[decibel]]s (dB);

:&lt;math&gt;RL(\mathrm{dB}) = 10 \log_{10} {P_\mathrm i \over P_\mathrm r}&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''RL''(dB) is the return loss in dB, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the incident power and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the reflected power.
Return loss is related to both [[standing wave ratio]] (SWR) and [[reflection coefficient]] (Γ).  Increasing return loss corresponds to lower SWR.  Return loss is a measure of how well devices or lines are matched.  A match is good if the return loss is high.  A high return loss is desirable and results in a lower [[insertion loss]].

Return loss is used in modern practice in preference to SWR because it has better resolution for small values of reflected wave.&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt;

==Sign==
Properly, loss quantities, when expressed in decibels, should be positive numbers.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Except for cases where an active device succeeds in reflecting back more power than was sent into it.  This is the case, for instance, with the [[negative resistance#Amplifiers|tunnel diode amplifier]].&lt;/ref&gt;  However, return loss has historically been expressed as a negative number, and this convention is still widely found in the literature.&lt;ref name=Bird&gt;Trevor S. Bird, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5162049 "Definition and Misuse of Return Loss"], ''IEEE Antennas &amp; Propagation Magazine'', '''vol.51''', iss.2, pp.166-167, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The correct definition of return loss is the difference in dB between the incident power sent towards the Device Under Test (DUT) and the power reflected, resulting in a positive sign:

:&lt;math&gt;RL(\mathrm{dB}) = 10 \log_{10} {P_\mathrm i \over P_\mathrm r}&lt;/math&gt;

However taking the ratio of '''reflected''' to '''incident''' power results in a negative sign for return loss;

:&lt;math&gt;RL'(\mathrm{dB}) = 10 \log_{10} {P_\mathrm r \over P_\mathrm i}&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''RL'''(dB) is the negative of ''RL''(dB).
Return loss with a positive sign is identical to the magnitude of Γ when expressed in decibels but of opposite sign.  That is, return loss with a negative sign is more properly called reflection coefficient.&lt;ref name=Bird/&gt;  The [[S-parameter]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; from [[two-port network]] theory is frequently also called return loss,&lt;ref&gt;Noel G. Barton, Jacques Periaux, "Coupling of fluids, structures, and waves in aeronautics", proceedings of a French-Australian workshop in Melbourne, Australia, 3–6 December 2001, p.187, Springer, 2003 {{ISBN|3-540-40222-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but is actually equal to Γ.

Caution is required when discussing increasing or decreasing return loss since these terms strictly have the opposite meaning when return loss is defined as a negative quantity.

==Electrical==
In metallic conductor systems, reflections of a signal traveling down a conductor can occur at a discontinuity or [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] mismatch. The ratio of the amplitude of the reflected wave ''V&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' to the amplitude of the incident wave ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is known as the [[reflection coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit \Gamma = {V_\mathrm r \over V_\mathrm i}&lt;/math&gt;

When the source and load impedances are known values, the reflection coefficient is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit \Gamma = { {Z_\mathrm L - Z_\mathrm S} \over {Z_\mathrm L + Z_\mathrm S} }&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is the impedance toward the [[voltage source|source]] and ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the impedance toward the [[Electrical load|load]].

Return loss is the negative of the magnitude of the reflection coefficient in dB. Since power is proportional to the square of the voltage, return loss is given by,

:&lt;math&gt;RL(\mathrm{dB}) = -20 \log_{10} \left| \mathit \Gamma \right|&lt;/math&gt;

where  the [[vertical direction|vertical]] bars indicate [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]]. Thus, a large positive return loss indicates the reflected power is small relative to the incident power, which indicates good impedance match from source to load.

When the actual transmitted (incident) power and the reflected power are known (i.e., through measurements and/or calculations), then the return loss in dB can be calculated as the difference between the incident power ''P''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (in [[dBm]]) and the reflected power ''P''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; (in dBm),

:&lt;math&gt;RL(\mathrm{dB}) = P_\mathrm i(\mathrm{dBm}) - P_\mathrm r(\mathrm{dBm})\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Optical==
In [[optics]] (particularly in [[optical fiber|fiberoptics]]) a loss that takes place at discontinuities of [[refractive index]], especially at an air-[[glass]] [[wiktionary:interface|interface]] such as a fiber endface. At those interfaces, a fraction of the optical [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] is reflected back toward the source.  This reflection phenomenon is also called "'''[[Fresnel reflection]] loss'''," or simply "'''Fresnel loss'''."

Fiber optic transmission systems use [[laser]]s to transmit signals over optical fiber, and a high optical return loss (ORL) can cause the laser to stop transmitting correctly. The measurement of ORL is becoming more important in the characterization of optical networks as the use of [[wavelength-division multiplexing]] increases.  These systems use lasers that have a lower tolerance for ORL, and introduce elements into the network that are located in close proximity to the laser.

:&lt;math&gt;\text{ORL}(\mathrm{dB}) = 10 \log_{10} {P_\mathrm i \over P_\mathrm r}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_\mathrm r&lt;/math&gt; is the reflected power and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_\mathrm i&lt;/math&gt; is the incident, or input, power.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12455">In [[functional analysis]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], '''stereotype algebras''' are [[topological algebra]]s defined as [[stereotype space]]s with a (unital and associative) multiplication satisfying the condition of separate uniform continuity on compact sets.

== Definition ==
There are two equivalent ways to define stereotype algebra. 

* '''An abstract definition''': a (projective&lt;ref name=projectivealgebra&gt;There is another notion, an '''injective stereotype algebra''', which is defined as a [[monoid (category theory)|monoid]] in the [[Stereotype space#Category of stereotype spaces|monoidal category ('''Ste''',&lt;math&gt;\odot&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;{\mathbb C}&lt;/math&gt;)]] of stereotype spaces with the dual tensor product, &lt;math&gt;\odot&lt;/math&gt;. The class of these algebras is much narrower.&lt;/ref&gt;) '''stereotype algebra'''{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=271}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2005}} is a [[monoid (category theory)|monoid]] in the [[Stereotype space#Category of stereotype spaces|monoidal category ('''Ste''',&lt;math&gt;\circledast&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;{\mathbb C}&lt;/math&gt;)]] of stereotype spaces with the tensor product &lt;math&gt;\circledast&lt;/math&gt;.

* '''An analytic definition''': let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a [[stereotype space]] (over the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt; of complex numbers&lt;ref&gt;...or the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers&lt;/ref&gt;) and suppose it is endowed with a bilinear operation &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in A\times A\mapsto x\cdot y\in A&lt;/math&gt; that turns &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; into a [[unital algebra|unital]] and [[associative algebra]] (over the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt;). Then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is called a (projective) '''stereotype algebra'''{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=271}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2009|p=483}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2016|p=147}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2017|p=594}} if the multiplication &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in A\times A\to A&lt;/math&gt; is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_space#Universality_of_'%22%60UNIQ--postMath-0000014E-QINU%60%22' continuous bilinear map in the stereotype sense], i.e. if for each [[compact set]] &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; and for each neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; there is a neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;V\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;S\cdot V\subseteq U\quad \&amp;\quad V\cdot S\subseteq U.
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The requirement on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in the analytic definition of stereotype algebra can be equivalently expressed as follows: for each [[compact set]] &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; and for each [[Net (mathematics)|net]] &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; tending to zero in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;
y_i\overset{A}{\underset{i\to\infty}{\longrightarrow}}0
&lt;/math&gt; 
the nets &lt;math&gt;x\cdot y_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_i\cdot x&lt;/math&gt; tend to zero in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; uniformly on &lt;math&gt;x\in S&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;math&gt;
x\cdot y_i\overset{A}{\underset{x\in S}{\underset{i\to\infty}{\rightrightarrows}}}0
\quad \&amp;\quad y_i\cdot x\overset{A}{\underset{x\in S}{\underset{i\to\infty}{\rightrightarrows}}}0.
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''morphism of stereotype algebras'' &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous unital&lt;ref&gt;A homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi:A\to B&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''unital'' if it preserves unit: &lt;math&gt;\varphi(1_A)=1_B&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi:A\to B&lt;/math&gt;.

Stereotype algebras form a subclass in the class of ''separately continuous'' [[topological algebra]]s.

== Stereotype modules ==

A stereotype space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''left stereotype module'' over a stereotype algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, if a bilinear operation &lt;math&gt;(a,x)\in A\times X\mapsto a\cdot x\in X&lt;/math&gt; is defined that turns &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; into a left [[module (mathematics)|module]] over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and this operation is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_space#Universality_of_'%22%60UNIQ--postMath-0000014E-QINU%60%22' continuous bilinear map in the stereotype sense]: for each [[compact set]] &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; and for each neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; there is a neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;V\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; such that 

&lt;math&gt;
S\cdot V\subseteq U,
&lt;/math&gt;

and at the same time for each [[compact set]] &lt;math&gt;T\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; and for each neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; there is a neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;W\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; such that 

&lt;math&gt;
W\cdot T\subseteq U.
&lt;/math&gt;

The notion of a ''right stereotype module'' over a stereotype algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is defined by analogy.

The theory of stereotype algebras allows to simplify the formulations in the theory of [[topological algebra]]s and to bring this field closer to [[abstract algebra]]. The following two results (which do not hold for general jointly or separately continuous algebras) are typical illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Other illustrations are the already mentioned [[Group algebra#Stereotype group algebras|universality property for the stereotype group algebras]]{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=275}} and the structure of [[Hopf algebra]] on them{{sfn|Akbarov|2009|p=507}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theorem'''.{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=283}} ''A stereotype space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with a structure of left (right) module over a stereotype algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a stereotype module over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the operation of multiplication &lt;math&gt;(a,x)\in A\times X\mapsto a\cdot x\in X&lt;/math&gt; (respectively, &lt;math&gt;(x,a)\in X\times A\mapsto x\cdot a\in X&lt;/math&gt;) defines a continuous map (a representation) &lt;math&gt;A\to X\oslash X&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;ref&gt;Here &lt;math&gt;X\oslash X&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Stereotype space#Ste as a *-autonomous category|stereotype space of operators &lt;math&gt;\varphi:X\to X&lt;/math&gt;]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theorem'''.{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=289}} ''For each stereotype algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the categories &lt;sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'''Ste''' and '''Ste'''&lt;sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; of left and right stereotype modules over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are [[Enriched category|enriched categories]] over the [[Stereotype space#Ste as a *-autonomous category|monoidal category ('''Ste''',&lt;math&gt;\circledast&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;{\mathbb C}&lt;/math&gt;)]] of stereotype spaces.''

== Applications ==

The notion of stereotype algebra is used in the generalizations{{sfn|Akbarov|2017}} of the [[Pontryagin  duality]] theory to the classes of non-commutative groups based on the notion of [[Envelope (category theory)|envelope]]: the holomorphic, the smooth and the continuous envelopes of stereotype algebras lead respectively to the constructions of the holomorphic, the smooth and the continuous dualities in ''big geometric disciplines'' – [[complex geometry]], [[differential geometry]], and [[topology]] – for certain classes of (not necessarily commutative) topological groups considered in these disciplines ([[affine algebraic group]]s, and some classes of [[Lie group]]s and Moore groups).{{sfn|Akbarov|2009}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2016}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2017}}{{sfn|Kuznetsova|2013}}

'''Surrogation''' is a [[Psychology|psychological]] phenomenon in which the measure(s) of a [[Construct (philosophy)|construct of interest]] evolve to replace the construct itself. Research on [[performance measurement]] in [[management accounting]] has identified surrogation as "the tendency for managers to lose sight of the [[Strategic management|strategic]] construct(s) the [performance] measures are intended to represent, and subsequently act as though the measures ''are'' the constructs of interest" (emphasis in original).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Willie|last2=Hecht|first2=Gary|last3=Tayler|first3=William B.|date=2012-07-04|title=Strategy Selection, Surrogation, and Strategic Performance Measurement Systems|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2012.00465.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Accounting Research|language=EN|volume=51|issue=1|pages=105-133|doi=10.1111/j.1475-679X.2012.00465.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; An everyday example of surrogation is a manager tasked with increasing customer satisfaction who begins to believe that the customer satisfaction survey score actually ''is'' customer satisfaction.

==First usage==
Inspired by work by [[Yuji Ijiri]], the term ''surrogation'' was coined by Willie Choi, Gary Hecht, and William Tayler in their paper, "Lost in Translation: The Effects of Incentive Compensation on Strategy Surrogation".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Willie|last2=Hecht|first2=Gary|last3=Tayler|first3=William B.|date=2011-05-24|title=Lost in Translation: The Effects of Incentive Compensation on Strategy Surrogation|url=http://www.aaapubs.org/doi/10.2308/accr-10273?code=aaan-site|journal=The Accounting Review|language=EN|volume=87|issue=4|pages=1135-1163|doi=10.2308/accr-10273}}&lt;/ref&gt;   They show [[Management|managers]] tend to use measures as surrogates for [[Business strategy|strategy]], acting as if measures were in fact the strategy when making optimization decisions. This appears to occur even if a measure-maximizing choice ultimately works against the strategy.

They also show surrogation is exacerbated by [[Incentive program|incentive compensation]]. But, the phenomenon is distinct from [[wealth]]-maximizing behavior, since it persists both when incentives are removed and when they are changed to create an [[opportunity cost]] for maximizing the surrogate. The additional tendency to surrogate in the presence of incentives is reduced when managers are compensated based on multiple measures of a strategy rather than on a single measure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Choi et al. proposed [[attribute substitution]] as a mechanism for surrogation. Attribute substitution in [[decision-making]] involves a complex ''target attribute'' being replaced by a more easily accessible ''[[Heuristics in judgment and decision-making|heuristic]] attribute''. For this to occur, the target attribute must be relatively inaccessible, the heuristic attribute must be readily accessible, and the mental substitution must not be consciously rejected by the person. In the case of surrogation, the two attributes are related in that some party intends the heuristic attribute to serve as proxy for the target attribute.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Further studies==
In a follow-up study, Choi, Hecht, and Tayler demonstrate involving managers in the selection of a strategy reduces their tendency to surrogate. Merely involving managers in the strategy deliberation process does not appear to have the same surrogation-reducing effect as involving them in the actual selection of the strategy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Jeremiah Bentley shows the effects of incentive compensation on surrogation are partially [[Mediation (statistics)|explained]] by a mechanism in which measure-based incentive compensation (in this case using a single measure) and wealth-maximizing behavior lead [[Principal–agent problem|agents]] to [[Campbell's law|distort]] their operational decisions (see [[Campbell's law]]). That operational distortion, in turn, leads them to [[Belief revision|change their beliefs]] about the compensated measure's causal relationship with the outcome—in other words, to surrogate—possibly as a means of reducing [[cognitive dissonance]] arising from inconsistency between beliefs and actions. He demonstrates that allowing people to provide narrative explanations for their decisions reduces the amount of operational distortion observed under an incentive compensation scheme, and also reduces surrogation. He also finds that the effect is larger for people who have a high preference for consistency, which supports the argument that surrogation is due to an attempt to reduce cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bentley|first=Jeremiah W.|date=2017-02-24|title=Decreasing Operational Distortion and Surrogation through Narrative Reporting|ssrn=2924726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Bloomfield had proposed a link between cognitive dissonance and surrogation in an earlier paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bloomfield|first=Robert J.|date=2015-02-01|title=Rethinking Managerial Reporting|url=http://aaajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2308/jmar-51061|journal=Journal of Management Accounting Research|language=EN|volume=27|issue=1|pages=139–150|doi=10.2308/jmar-51061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a subsequent study, Paul Black, Tom Meservy, William Tayler, and Jeff Williams show that surrogation can occur simply when a measure is provided to managers, even if they do not receive incentive compensation based on the measure. That is, if managers know that something is being measured, they will begin to surrogate on that measure, ''even if they are told that the measure is no more nor less important that other measures when determining their compensation.'' This implies that firms must be careful in determining what measures are communicated to managers, as managers may surrogate on a measure just because they hear that it is being measured.

William Tayler discusses everyday examples of surrogation and incentive compensation on BYU News Radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.byuradio.org/episode/8c31b2be176e4d5b9a02ed1b41b2d42d/the-morning-show-drones-incentives-and-taliban-poets|title=Episode - BYUradio|website=www.byuradio.org|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surrogation is conceptually related to Plato's [[Allegory of the Cave]] in that people are failing to distinguish the shadow (i.e. the measure) from the form (i.e. the [[Construct (philosophy)|construct]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bloomfield|first=Robert J.|date=2014-04-22|title=What Counts and What Gets Counted|ssrn=2427106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surrogation is also related to [[Simulacra and Simulation|Baudrillard's concept of simulacra]], in his order-of-simulacra theory. The connection to this concept is discussed in Macintosh, Shearer, Thornton and Welker (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macintosh|first=Norman B.|last2=Shearer|first2=Teri|last3=Thornton|first3=Daniel B.|last4=Welker|first4=Michael|date=2000|title=Accounting as Simulacrum and Hyperreality: Perspectives on Income and Capital|journal=Accounting, Organizations &amp; Society|volume=25|pages=13–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a compliment to analyses of production and its processes, '''Sustainable Consumption''' (SC) is the study of resource and energy use (domestic or otherwise). As the term sustainability would imply, those who study SC seek to apply the concept of “continuance”—the capacity to meet both present and future human generational needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Paul Ekins|last2=Newby|first2=Les|date=1998|title=Sustainable Wealth Creation At The Local Level In An Age Of Globalization|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00343409850118013|journal=Regional Studies|language=en|volume=32|issue=9|pages=863–871|doi=10.1080/00343409850118013|issn=0034-3404}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/15489268|title=Our common future|date=1987|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=World Commission on Environment and Development.|isbn=019282080X|location=Oxford|oclc=15489268}}&lt;/ref&gt; SC, then, would also include analyses of efficiency, infrastructure, and waste, as well as access to basic services, green and decent jobs and a better quality of life for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/|title=Sustainable consumption and production|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shares a number of common features with and is closely linked to the terms [[Sustainable product development|sustainable production]] and [[sustainable development]]. Sustainable consumption as part of [[sustainable development]] is a prerequisite in the worldwide struggle against [[sustainability]] challenges such as [[climate change]], [[resource depletion]], famines or [[environmental pollution]].

Sustainable development as well as sustainable consumption rely on certain premises such as:

* Effective [[resource use|use of resources]], and minimisation of [[waste]] and [[pollution]]
* Use of [[renewable resource]]s within their capacity for renewal
* Fuller [[product life-cycle]]s
* [[Intergenerational equity|Intergenerational]] and intragenerational equity

==The Oslo definition==
The definition proposed by the 1994 Oslo Symposium on Sustainable Consumption defines it as "the use of services and related products which respond to basic needs and bring a better [[quality of life]] while minimizing the use of natural resources and toxic materials as well as emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle of the service or product so as not to jeopardize the needs of future generations."&lt;ref&gt;Source: Norwegian Ministry of the Environment (1994) Oslo Roundtable on Sustainable Production and Consumption.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strong and weak sustainable consumption ==
{{tone|section|date=October 2017|reason=should be rephrased as encyclopedic definition, not as action plan from the proponents' PoV. Also, who coined these terms?}}
In order to achieve sustainable consumption, two developments have to take place: it requires both an increase in the efficiency of consumption as well as a change in consumption patterns and reductions in consumption levels in industrialized countries as well as rich social classes in developing countries which have also a large ecological footprint and give examples for increasing middle classes in developing countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009|editor-last=Meier|editor-first=Lars|editor2-last=Lange|editor2-first=Hellmuth|title=The New Middle Classes|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4020-9938-0|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-9938-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The first prerequisite is not sufficient on its own and can be named weak sustainable consumption. Here, technological improvements and [[eco-efficiency]] support a necessary reduction in [[resource consumption]]. Once this aim has been met, the second prerequisite, the change in patterns and reduction of levels of consumption is indispensable. Strong sustainable consumption approaches also pay attention to the social dimension of [[well-being]] and assess the need for changes based on a risk-averse perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lorek|first1=Sylvia|last2=Fuchs|first2=Doris|title=Strong Sustainable Consumption Governance - Precondition for a Degrowth Path?|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2013|volume=38|pages=36–43|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2011.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve what can be termed strong sustainable consumption, changes in infrastructures as well as the choices customers have are required. In the political arena, weak sustainable consumption has been discussed whereas strong sustainable consumption is missing from all debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fuchs|first1=Doris|last2=Lorek|first2=Sylvia|title=Sustainable Consumption Governance: A History of Promises and Failures|journal=Journal of Consumer Policy|date=2005|volume=28|pages=261–288|doi=10.1007/s10603-005-8490-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called [[Attitude-behavior gap|attitude-behaviour]] or [[values-action gap]] describes a significant obstacle to changes in individual customer behavior. Many consumers are well aware of the importance of their consumption choices and care about environmental issues, however, most of them do not translate their concerns into their consumption patterns as the purchase-decision making process is highly complicated and relies on e.g. social, political and psychological factors. Young et al. identified a lack of time for research, high prices, a lack of information and the cognitive effort needed as the main barriers when it comes to [[green consumption]] choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Young|first1=William|title=Sustainable Consumption: Green Consumer Behaviour when Purchasing Products|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2010|issue=18|pages=20–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable conferences and programs==

*1992 - At the [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED) the concept of sustainable consumption was established in chapter 4 of the Agenda 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=United Nations|title=Agenda 21|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/Agenda21.pdf|format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*1994 - Sustainable Consumption Symposium in Oslo

A statement issued in 2013 by the institute on its official web site read: "As of summer 2013, the Institute has suspended its activities following the formation of a new charity, [[The Idries Shah Foundation]]."&lt;ref name="ICR-Ceased-2014" /&gt;

==History==
The institute was founded in 1965 by the well-known writer, thinker and [[Sufism|Sufi]] teacher [[Idries Shah]]&lt;ref name="wintle"&gt;Justin Wintle (ed), ''Makers of Modern Culture'', Volume I, p474, Routledge, 2001, {{ISBN|0-415-26583-5}}.

In his book ''Listening to Idries Shah'', author, [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapist]] and tutor, [[Ivan Tyrrell]] recounts a conversation in which Shah explained his reasons for founding the ICR: "I want to attract ordinary people and help them think about psychological and cultural issues. But, as an individual, I can't easily get people to listen seriously. I discovered, however, that if I call myself an 'institute' – they will," Shah told him.&lt;ref name="Tyrrell"&gt;{{cite book

==Aims and remit==
The Institute's stated aim was "to stimulate study, debate, education and research into all aspects of human thought, behaviour and culture" and to make the results of its members' academic work accessible to society and also to academics working in different fields.&lt;ref name="charity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="icr-about" /&gt;

The body, which had a number of distinguished Fellows, published several dozen academic monographs and some books over the years&lt;ref name="charity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="icr-about" /&gt; and held regular events.&lt;ref name="charity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guidestar-statement"&gt;[http://www.guidestar.org.uk/gs_activities.aspx?CCReg=0AWV1MgzSc0%2fkY4xcMOB1g%3d%3d&amp;strQuery= ICR's statement of public benefit at Guidestar.org.uk], made in light of the new Charities Act. Retrieved on 2008-11-14.&lt;/ref&gt; These events usually included a series of six lectures by specialists per year, and a two-day seminar which is usually held in the Autumn. The aim of these was "to connect ideas across disciplines, across cultures, and even through history" and to bring about a broader, more holistic understanding by looking at issues from several different perspectives, with particular interest in human thought and behaviour and issues neglected by contemporary culture.&lt;ref name="guidestar-statement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="icr-events"&gt;[http://www.i-c-r.org.uk/events/index.php Events held by the Institute for Cultural Research] Retrieved on 2008-11-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Institute supported projects in areas where freedom of access to facts was threatened,&lt;ref name="charity" /&gt; for example in the case of [[Afghanistan]] where assistance had been given to the [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF)'s female educational projects.&lt;ref name="icr-about" /&gt;

All the Institute for Cultural Research's activities were open to the general public.&lt;ref name="charity" /&gt;

==Notable contributors==
The institute published so many [[monograph]]s and hosted so many [[lecture]]s and [[seminar]]s that only a small sample of notable contributors are listed here.&lt;ref name="scholar-list"&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;q=%22icr.org.uk%22&amp;btnG=Search Google Scholar search results for ICR publications (pdf files)] Retrieved on 2008-11-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Time-out''' is a form of behavioral modification that involves temporarily separating a person from an environment where unacceptable behavior has occurred. The goal is to remove that person from an enriched, enjoyable environment, and therefore lead to [[extinction (psychology)|extinction]] of the offending behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 23881717|title = Is Isolation Room Time-Out a Punisher?|journal = Behavioral Disorders|volume = 6|issue = 4|pages = 247–256|last1 = Smith|first1 = Donald E. P|year = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an educational and [[parenting]] technique recommended by most [[pediatrician]]s and [[developmental psychologist]]s as an effective form of [[discipline]]. Often a corner (hence the common term ''corner time'') or a similar space where the person is to stand or sit during time-outs is designated. This form of discipline is especially popular in western cultures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Invitation to the Life Span|last = Berger|first = Kathleen Stassen|publisher = Worth Publisher|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the punishment is often known as the '''naughty chair''' or '''naughty step'''. This term became popular in the US thanks to two reality TV series, ''[[Supernanny]]'' and ''[[Nanny 911]]''.

==History==
The concept of time-out was invented,{{dubious|reason=what chance is there that there have been fewer than thousands (at the very least, and perhaps millions) of prior independent inventions of the core practice?|date=October 2018}} named, and used (see Child Magazine, 2006, "20 People who Changed Childhood"&lt;ref name="20 People Who Changed Childhood"&gt;{{cite article|title= 20 People Who Changed Childhood|author=R. Straus|date=October 2006|pages=107–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;) by [[Arthur W. Staats]] in his extended work with his daughter (and later son), and was part of a long-term program of behavioral analysis beginning in 1958 that treated various aspects of child development. He introduced various elements that later composed foundations for applied behavior analysis and behavior therapy. (The [[token reward system]] was another invention by him.) [[Montrose Wolf]], a graduate student assistant of Staats on several studies dealing with reading learning in preschoolers (see, for example, "The conditioning of textual responses using 'extrinsic' reinforcers"&lt;ref name=" The conditioning of textual responses using 'extrinsic' reinforcers"&gt;{{cite article|title= The conditioning of textual responses using 'extrinsic' reinforcers|author=Staats, A.W.; Staats, C.K.; Schultz, R.E.; Wolf, M.|date=1962|pages=33–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;), used that background when he went to the [[University of Washington]] where he began his creative program of research. Wolf began the widespread use of Staats' time-out procedure in extending training methods to an autistic child (see the 1964 published study dealing with the behavioral treatment of a child).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=1226164 | pmid=16033175 | doi=10.1901/jaba.2005.165-04 | volume=38 | issue=2 | title=Montrose M. Wolf (1935-2004) | year=2005 | journal=J Appl Behav Anal | pages=279–87 | last1 = Risley | first1 = T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1404175&amp;blobtype=pdf | pmc = 1404175 | pmid=13916029 | doi=10.1901/jeab.1962.5-33 | volume=5 | title=The conditioning of textual responses using &amp;quot;extrinsic&amp;quot; reinforcers | year=1962 | journal=J Exp Anal Behav | pages=33–40 | last1 = Staats | first1 = AW | last2 = Staats | first2 = CK | last3 = Schutz | first3 = RE | last4 = Wolf | first4 = M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Staats described the discipline of his 2-year-old daughter in 1962: "I would put her in her crib and indicate that she had to stay there until she stopped crying. If we were in a public place [where her behavior was inappropriate], I would pick her up and go outside."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Strauss, "Twenty People Who Changed Childhood," ''Child'' magazine, October 2006, pp107-110.&lt;/ref&gt; .

== Application ==
For Staats, the timeout period was ended when the child's misbehavior, such as crying inappropriately, ended. He considered removal from a positive emotional environment to one of lesser positivity as a very mild punishment. Various people have added their opinions regarding time-out as the following indicates.

Time out is a type two [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment procedure]] and is used commonly in schools, colleges, offices, clinics and homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wolf | first1 = Tera L. | last2 = McLaughlin | first2 = T. F. | last3 = Lee Williams | first3 = Randy | year = 2006 | title = Time-out interventions and strategies: A brief review and recommendations | url = | journal = International Journal of Special Education | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 22–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To implement time out, a caregiver removes the child from a reinforcing activity for a short period of time, usually 5 to 15 minutes, in order to discourage inappropriate behavior and teach the child that engaging in problem behavior will result in decreased access to reinforcing items and events in the child's environment.

Time-outs may be on a chair, step, corner, bedroom, or any other location where there are no distractions and reduced access to fun items, activities and people.  This procedure is preferable to other punishments such as reprimanding, yelling at or spanking the child for their misbehavior, which are type one punishments ([[positive punishment]]).

Research has established that 15 minutes is the maximum time that a child should be kept in time out from reinforcers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = G. D. | last2 = Nielsen | first2 = G. | last3 = Johnson | first3 = S. M. | year = 1972 | title = TIMEOUT DURATION AND THE SUPPRESSION OF DEVIANT BEHAVIOR IN CHILDREN1 | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 111–120 | doi=10.1901/jaba.1972.5-111| pmc = 1310739 | pmid=16795328}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, shorter durations may be just as effective for behavior change.

For this disciplinary technique to be most effective and to produce the desired results, the child should be old enough to sit still and is required to remain there for a fixed period. Also, according to developmental psychologists, parents should evaluate each situation to determine what may be causing the misbehavior, such as a toy, frustration, hunger, or lack of sleep, and then address any underlying needs before a punishment contingency should be used. Any time they are trying to reduce a problem behavior, parents should be sure that they are also teaching and reinforcing the desired replacement behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Discipline and Effective Parenting|last = Flaskerud|first = Jacquelyn H.|date = 2011|journal = Issues in Mental Health Nursing|accessdate = |doi = 10.3109/01612840.2010.498078|pmid =21208055|volume=32|issue = 1|pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents should also clearly explain why the child is being put in time out, and what the child needs to do to return to the reinforcing environment/be let out of time-out (but too much explanation can reinforce the unwanted behavior as a result of "misplaced adult attention"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200109/why-our-kids-are-out-control ''Psychology Today'' September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;). Furthermore, the renown developmental psychologist Kathleen Stassen Berger suggests that time-out should remain brief, proposing a general guideline: the length of time that the child should remain in time-out should correlate with the child's age - each of year of the child's age constitutes one minute in time-out.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Time-out is one behavior control method based on removing [[positive reinforcement]] for a brief time.  Less elaborate methods from the same class like [[tactical ignoring]], or planned ignoring, also can be effective in cases where parental/caregiver attention is the positive reinforcement for negative behavior. This class of methods are more effective if the child gets a significant amount positive reinforcement (praise, attention) for good behavior. All punishment procedures can evoke other problem behaviors, damage rapport, or evoke escape or avoidant behaviors. For this, and other ethical reasons, behavior analysts exhaust all options for using differential reinforcement and/or [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]] procedures to reduce problem behavior, before considering the use of punishment procedures.

==Effectiveness==
Several studies show that time-out is an especially effective disciplinary strategy, reducing aggressive and non-compliant behavior, when other positive parenting methods are also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Parental Use of Time Out Revisited: A Useful or Harmful Parenting Strategy?|last = Morawska|first = Alina|date = February 2011|journal = Journal of Child and Family Studies|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Time out must be linked with "time in" in order to be effective because children need to be able to find reinforcement through positive experiences.

There are differences between strategies for ending time out. While some proponents of time-outs insist on silence and stillness from the child during the time-out, it is easier to use a "release-contingency," such that the requirement is only that the child is sitting peacefully at the end of the time-out period. Those who use time-out for children to get anger and frustration "out of their system" or for children to think about their behavior are using time-out in a way that is different than those basing it on operant behavioral principles (that time-out from positive reinforcement may reduce recurrences of the unwanted target behavior).

In a study by Donaldson and Vollmer, the efficacy of a fixed duration time-out and a release contingency time-out were compared. In the fixed duration condition, children were sent to time-out for a total of 4 minutes and were released from time-out whether or not they performed problem behavior during the time-out session. In the release contingency condition, children were not released from time-out if they were performing problem behavior during the last 30 seconds of their time-out. The time-out was extended until there were no occurrences of problem behavior for a total of 30 seconds or until the time-out reached the ten-minute mark. Results showed that both time-out procedures were successful in reducing the problem behavior for the subjects. The subjects in the release contingency did not benefit from staying in time-out for an extended period of time either. Moreover, the results show that only 4 minutes is necessary for a successful time-out procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Donaldson | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Vollmer | first2 = T. R. | year = 2011 | title = An evaluation and comparison of time-out procedures with and without release contingencies | journal = Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis | volume = 44 | issue = 4| pages = 693–705 | doi=10.1901/jaba.2011.44-693 | pmid=22219523 | pmc=3251275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of time-out also varies with each individual child, dependent on the child's age, temperament and emotional wellness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Disadvantages==
Critics of time-out include [[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)|Thomas Gordon]], [[Gabor Maté (physician)|Gabor Mate]], [[Alfie Kohn]] and [[Aletha Solter]], who claim that the approach may lead to short-term compliance but has the same disadvantages as other forms of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, T. (2000). Parent Effectiveness Training: The Proven Program for Raising Responsible Children. New York, NY: Three Rivers Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, A. (2005). Unconditional Parenting: Moving From Rewards and Punishments to Love and Reason. New York, NY: Atria Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solter, A. (1989). Helping Young Children Flourish. Goleta, CA: Shining Star Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solter, A. (2013). Attachment Play. Goleta, CA: Shining Star Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solter, A. (2002). The disadvantages of time-out. http://www.awareparenting.com/timeout.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seasoned teachers say 'Time-outs only seem to work at first because of shock value and over time it becomes less effective.' http://afineparent.com/be-positive/effective-discipline.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to these authors, the use of time-out does not enhance moral behavior or teach children useful conflict-resolution skills and it fails to address the underlying cause of the behavior. Furthermore, they claim that the parent/child bond can be damaged by forced isolation and withdrawal of love in an effort to control a child's behavior and this can lead to feelings of insecurity or anxiety in children, though there is no evidence that this occurs. Another argument is that time-out, like all other methods of [[coercive control]], eventually stops working as children grow older and begin to rebel against their parents’ authoritarian approach to discipline.

In addition to the potential psychological drawbacks resulting from the use of time-out, there also appears to be a risk to the child's developing brain, according to research in neuroscience by [[Daniel J. Siegel]]. “In a brain scan, relational pain (that caused by isolation during punishment) can look the same as physical abuse,” and “Repeated experiences actually change the physical structure of the brain.”&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, D.J. and Bryson, T.P. (September 23, 2014). ‘Time-Outs’ Are Hurting Your Child. Time Magazine online. http://time.com/3404701/discipline-time-out-is-not-good/&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dr. Siegel backed away from this statement and claimed that Time Magazine distorted his message. He later clarified, "The “appropriate” use of time-outs calls for brief, infrequent, previously explained breaks from an interaction used as part of a thought-out parenting strategy that is followed by positive feedback and connection with a parent. This seems not only reasonable, but it is an overall approach supported by the research as helpful for many children."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drdansiegel.com/blog/2014/10/29/you-said-what-about-time-outs/|title=You Said WHAT About Time-Outs?! {{!}} Dr. Dan Siegel|website=www.drdansiegel.com|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Association for Infant Mental Health has published a position statement in which the use of time-out is considered inappropriate, especially for children under three years of age, which matches with most professional advice.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Association for Infant Mental Health (July 2009): Position Pager 3: Time Out. {{cite web |url=http://www.aaimhi.org/inewsfiles/Position%20Paper%203.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908074504/http://www.aaimhi.org/inewsfiles/Position%20Paper%203.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of time-out needs to be carefully considered in families dealing with special challenges. In a review of parenting intervention programs for drug-abusing mothers, researchers found that programs emphasizing behavioral approaches to discipline (such as the use of time-out and rewards) “were not successful in fostering measurable improvement in mother-child interactions or promoting child development.” An attachment-based approach focusing on strengthening the parent/child relationship was found to be more successful than behavioral approaches in changing children's behavior in these families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Suchman | first1 =  | last2 = Pajulo | first2 = M. | last3 = DeCoste | first3 = C. | last4 = Mayes | first4 = L.C. | year = 2006 | title = Parenting Interventions for Drug-Dependent Mothers and Their Young Children: The Case for an Attachment-Based Approach | journal = Family Relations | volume = 55 | issue = 2| pages = 211–226 | pmc=1847954 | pmid=17417669 | doi=10.1111/j.1741-3729.2006.00371.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have found that the traditional behavioral approach to discipline (such as the use of time-out and rewards) can be challenging with children in foster care with attachment disorders resulting from early abuse or neglect. Foster parents benefit from training that addresses these children's attachment and emotional issues, as wells as traditional parenting techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wotherspoon | first1 = E. | last2 = O'Neill-Laberge | first2 = M. | last3 = Pirie | first3 = J. | year = 2008 | title = Meeting the emotional needs of infants and toddlers in foster care: the collaborative mental health care experience | url = | journal = Infant Mental Health Journal | volume = 29 | issue = 4| pages = 377–397 | doi = 10.1002/imhj.20185 | pmid = 28636157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Time-out has been misused to the point of becoming abusive in some schools and so proper training for educational professionals is important. There are reported cases of children being locked in closets for extended periods of solitary confinement for behaviors such as crying or failing to finish an assignment.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, I. (1990). Child abusers' destructive use of 'time-out'. From Reading, Writing and the Hickory Stick, pp. 139-140, 12-13. http://www.nospank.net/timeout.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some experts call school time-out rooms 'abuse.' http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/2008-10-20-time-out-discipline_N.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These are not examples of appropriate use of time-out.

The '''Transnational Radical Party''' ('''TRP'''), whose official name is '''Nonviolent Radical Party, Transnational and Transparty''' ('''NRPTT'''), is a political association of citizens, members of parliament and members of government of various national and political backgrounds who intend to adopt [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] means to create an effective body of [[international law]] with respect for individuals, [[human rights|human]], [[civil and political rights]], as well as the affirmation of [[democracy]] and [[political freedom]] in the world.

The TRP does not participate in elections, and despite being named "party", is a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO), adept in building synergies among political forces aimed at achieving the goals of its congressional motions.

The TRP is the direct evolution of the Italian [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]] (1955–89) and is separate from the once-connected [[Italian Radicals]] party (founded in 2001), has been an NGO at the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) of the [[United Nations]] (UN) since 1995, listed in the general consultative status' category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/coordination/ngo/search/DisplayOrgInfo.asp?OrgID=655|title=1 June is the last day to apply for consultative status with ECOSOC|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TRP often advocates the international use of [[Esperanto]] in its literature.&lt;ref name="eo"&gt;[http://en.nitobe.info/ld/dokumentujo/dokumento.php?id=30&amp;priskribolingvo=en The International Politics of Esperanto] at the Nitobe Center for Language Democracy&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{further|Italian Radicals (disambiguation)|Pannella List|Bonino List|Italian Radicals}}

The TRP's forerunner, the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]] (PR), was established in 1955 by a left-wing splinter group from the centre-right [[Italian Liberal Party]] (PLI). In 1989 the PR was transformed into the TRP. In 1992 a majority of the Radicals formed, at the national-level in Italian politics, the [[Pannella List]], as its most senior figure was [[Marco Pannella]]. Since 1999 the List ran in elections under the banner of [[Bonino List]], named after [[Emma Bonino]]. In 2001 the Radicals in Italy formed the [[Italian Radicals]] (RI).

===Background and foundation===
In the [[European Parliament election, 1979 (Italy)|first European Parliament election in 1979]] the PR obtained its best result ever countrywide (3.7% of the vote, resulting in the election of three [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s, including Pannella). Following the election, the PR was involved with the [[European Green Party|Coordination of European Green and Radical Parties]] (CEGRP) and its unsuccessful efforts to create a single pan-European platform for green and radical politics.&lt;ref name="Bomberg2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Bomberg|title=Green Parties and Politics in the European Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7WIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70|date=2 August 2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-85145-4|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, since then, the party projected itself into international politics.

In 1988, after a decade during which transnational issues and values were emphasised, the PR's congress decided that the party would be transformed during 1989 into the TRP and that the latter would not present itself in elections (in order to avoid competition with the other parties and stimulate cooperation instead), while permitting "dual membership" with other parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Un programma politico|author=Sergio Stanzani|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/un-programma-politico|journal=Notizie Radicali|issue=51|date=11 March 1988|access-date=26 February 2017|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new symbol featuring the stylised face of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/il-simbolo-di-gandhi-fa-la-differenza|title=Il simbolo di Gandhi fa la differenza|author=Gianfranco Spadaccia|journal= Atti del convegno “I radicali e la nonviolenza: un metodo, una speranza”|location=Roma|date=29-30 April 1988|access-date=26 February 2016|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the point of no return in the transformation of the PR into an instrument of political fight completely at disposal of issue-oriented campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lettera aperta di Mauro Mellini al Primo segretario del Partito Radicale Sergio Stanzani|journal=Notizie Radicali|date=30 November 1988|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/lettera-aperta-di-mauro-mellini-al-primo-segretario-del-partito-radicale-sergio-stanzani|issue=262|access-date=26 February 2017|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Massimo Teodori|title=L'illusione transnazionale e transpartitica|journal=Marco Pannella — un eretico liberale nella crisi della repubblica|publisher=Casa editrice Marsilio|location=Venezia|date=1996|url=http://www.eclettico.org/cr/libri/teodori/diaspora.htm#_Toc490915674|access-date=26 February 2017|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All this provoked great controversy among Radicals. Some long-time members left in order to continue their own activity in other parties or retire from public life. However, also most TRP Radicals continued to be actively engaged in politics, sometimes supported by the TRP itself, sometimes seeking hospitality in traditional parties or creating entirely new electoral lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalparty.org/it/content/lorganizzazione-politica-dellantiproibizionismo|title=L'organizzazione politica dell'antiproibizionismo|date=1 July 1991|access-date=26 February 2016|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isimbolidelladiscordia.it/2016/05/in-memoria-di-marco-pannella-una-storia.html|title=In memoria di Marco Pannella: una storia, tanti simboli|date=19 May 2016|access-date=26 February 2017|author=Gabriele Maestri|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[European Parliament election, 1989 (Italy)|1989 European Parliament election]] Pannella stood as a successful candidate of the joint list between the PLI (his former party) and the [[Italian Republican Party]], some Radicals formed the "Anti-prohibition List on Drugs" (1 MEP), while others joined the [[Rainbow Greens]] (2 MEPs). In the run-up of the [[Italian general election, 1992|1992 general election]] the Pannella List was formed.

[[Sergio Stanzani]] and [[Emma Bonino]] were the first secretary and president of the party, respectively. In 1993 Bonino, who would be appointed to the [[European Commission]] in 1995, replaced Stanzani, and Pannella became president.

===International activities and ECOSOC recognition===
The TRP was soon involved in comparing the conditions of the [[rule of law]] among different democracies throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ISBN= 9788840400587|first=Massimo|last= Lensi|title=Oltre Chiasso|publisher=Nardini Editore|location= Firenze|year=2016|url=http://www.nardinieditore.it/prodotto/oltre-chiasso-il-mio-viaggio-con-marco-pannella-e-il-partito-radicale-transnazionale/|quote=The Transnational Radical Party is one of Marco Pannella's most interesting insights.

In 1995, after an intense institutional work, the TRP became a non-governmental organization for the promotion of human rights' legislation and the affirmation of democracy and freedom worldwide. As such, it was granted the general consultative status at the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) of the [[United Nations]] (UN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Onu/riconoscimento ngo del partito radicale|author=Marino Busdachin|date=21 June 1995|journal= appunto di Marino Busdachin per la conferenza segreteria e per Marco Pannella|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/onu-riconoscimento-ngo-del-partito-radicale-0|access-date=26 February 2017|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1995 [[Olivier Dupuis]], a long-time Radical from [[Belgium]] and founding member of the TRP who had moved to [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] in 1988 and from there had coordinated TRP's activities in Eastern Europe, was elected secretary of the party, while [[Jean-François Hory]], a [[France|French]] MEP of the [[Radical Party of the Left]] within the TRP-sponsored [[European Radical Alliance]] group, was president. In 1996 Dupuis took Pannella's seat in the European Parliament.

Within the UN, the party has carried out high-profile battles on several issues: the [[United Nations moratorium on the death penalty|moratorium on the death penalty]] and the proposal of his complete abolition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La pena di morte a fronte del diritto internazionale vigente.|author=Caterina Caravaggi|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/la-pena-di-morte-a-fronte-del-diritto-internazionale-vigente|date= 25 October 1991 |access-date=26 February 2016|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; anti-prohibition against global mafias,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Droga: Il Partito radicale e l'iniziativa contro il traffico clandestino delle droghe|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/droga-il-partito-radicale-e-liniziativa-contro-il-traffico-clandestino-delle-droghe|author=Stanzani Sergio|date=1 February 1989|journal=“I costi del proibizionismo sulle droghe” - Atti del colloquio internazionale sull’antiproibizionismo, Bruxelles 28 September - 1 October 1988|publisher=Ed.

Some confusion came from the fact that since the 2000s, rather than highlighting its expansion abroad, the TRP has preferred to focus on the "Case Italy", emblematic of the decadence of a constitutional political system into a "real democracy", that is to say a formal democracy in which its very institutions substantially act in contrast with the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/il-caso-italia-1-introduzione-lo-stato-della-giustizia-in-europa-i-convegno|title=IL CASO ITALIA: (1) Introduzione - LO STATO DELLA GIUSTIZIA IN EUROPA - I· CONVEGNO|access-date=2017-03-20|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marco Pannella|date=10 October 1989|title=Diritti democratici nella "Democrazia reale"|journal=IL GIORNALE D’ITALIA|access-date=20 March 2017|quote=|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/diritti-democratici-nella-democrazia-reale|language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the TRP, Italy has become a "[[Particracy|partycratic]] regime" and, as such, has started to spread the "plague" of "real democracy" around the democratic world. That was denounced by Radicals within international organisations and though the publication of a "yellow book" on the "Italian plague".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|author=Gruppo di Iniziativa di Satyagraha 2009 per lo Stato di diritto e la Democrazia cancellati in Italia|title=La Peste Italiana|url=http://www.radicali.it/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/peste_italiana.pdf|access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the TRP effectively suffered internal problems too. In 2003 Dupuis resigned from secretary because of serious political differences with Pannella. In 2011–14 [[Demba Traoré (politician)|Demba Traoré]], a politician from [[Mali]], served briefly as secretary: he left the party without officially resigning, after being returned to the government of his own country. The TRP was later provisionally run by a committee, known as the "Senate" (''Senato''), led by Pannella and composed of the party's leading members.

===Re-organisation and split of the Italian Radicals===
After the death of Pannella in May 2016, an extraordinary congress was convened in September to overcome the long inactivity due to the absence of the secretary, as well as the economic problems undermining the party's viability. The congress adopted with 178 votes in favour, 79 against and 13 abstentions on the final resolution:
*set three main goals (1. affirmation of the rule of law and the human right of knowledge; 2. justice reform in Italy, including pardon, amnesty, abolition of the [[article 41-bis prison regime]] and of life sentences; 3. formation of the [[United States of Europe]], inspired on the [[Ventotene Manifesto]]);
*set a membership target of 3,000 members for 2017 and 2018 in order to pay for the party's debts, otherwise the TRP would be dissolved;
*suspended the party's organs (president, secretary, treasurer, senate, etc.), with the exception of the congress;
*elected a collective leadership led by [[Rita Bernardini]], [[Antonella Casu]], [[Sergio D'Elia]] and [[Maurizio Turco]] (legal representative).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalparty.org/it/content/mozione-generale-del-40esimo-congresso-straordinario-del-partito-radicale-nonviolento-transn|title=MOZIONE GENERALE DEL 40ESIMO CONGRESSO STRAORDINARIO DEL PARTITO RADICALE NONVIOLENTO, TRANSNAZIONALE E TRANSPARTITO|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalparty.org/it/content/i-furbetti-del-partitino-consulenza-i-compagni-espulsi-o-di-espulsione|title=I furbetti del partitino (consulenza per i compagni espulsi o in via di espulsione)|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 IMHO by no means the material conditional may not be referred to or abbreviated as the adjective "truth functional", omitting a noun like "conditional" or "implication". Seems more like an internal link spamming rather than an appropriate dab hatnote. --Incnis Mrsi --&gt;
In [[logic]], a '''truth function'''&lt;ref&gt;Roy T. Cook (2009). ''A Dictionary of Philosophical Logic'', p. 294: Truth Function. Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that accepts [[Truth value|truth values]] as input and produces a truth value as output, i.e., the input and output are all truth values. The typical example is in [[Propositional calculus|propositional logic]], wherein a compound statement is constructed by one or two statements connected by a [[logical connective]]; if the truth value of the compound statement is determined by the truth value(s) of the constituent statement(s), the compound statement is called a '''truth function''', and the logical connective is said to be '''truth functional'''.&lt;ref&gt;Roy T. Cook (2009). ''A Dictionary of Philosophical Logic'', p. 295: Truth Functional. Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classical logic|Classical propositional logic]] is a '''truth-functional propositional logic''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/prop-log/  Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Propositional Logic], by Kevin C. Klement&lt;/ref&gt; in that every statement has exactly one truth value which is either true or false, and every logical connective is truth functional (with a correspondent [[truth table]]), thus every compound statement is a truth function.&lt;ref&gt;Roy T. Cook (2009). ''A Dictionary of Philosophical Logic'', p. 47: Classical Logic. Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, [[modal logic]] is non-truth-functional.

==Overview==
A [[logical connective]] is truth-functional if the truth-value of a compound sentence is a function of the truth-value of its sub-sentences.  A class of connectives is truth-functional if each of its members is. For example, the connective "''and''" is truth-functional since a sentence like "''Apples are fruits and carrots are vegetables''" is true ''[[if and only if|if, and only if]]'' each of its sub-sentences "''apples are fruits''" and "''carrots are vegetables''" is true, and it is false otherwise.  Some connectives of a natural language, such as English, are not truth-functional.

Connectives of the form "x ''believes that'' ..." are typical examples of connectives that are not truth-functional.  If e.g. Mary mistakenly believes that Al Gore was President of the USA on April 20, 2000, but she does not believe that the moon is made of green cheese, then the sentence

:"''Mary believes that Al Gore was President of the USA on April 20, 2000''"

is true while

:"''Mary believes that the moon is made of green cheese''"

is false.  In both cases, each component sentence (i.e. "''Al Gore was president of the USA on April 20, 2000''" and "''the moon is made of green cheese''") is false, but each compound sentence formed by prefixing the phrase "''Mary believes that''" differs in truth-value.  That is, the truth-value of a sentence of the form "''Mary believes that...''" is not determined solely by the truth-value of its component sentence, and hence the (unary) [[Logical connective|connective]] (or simply ''operator'' since it is unary) is non-truth-functional.

The class of [[classical logic]] connectives (e.g. [[and (logic)|&amp;]], [[material conditional|→]]) used in the construction of formulas is truth-functional.  Their values for various truth-values as argument are usually given by [[truth table]]s. [[Truth-functional propositional calculus]] is a [[formal system]] whose formulae may be interpreted as either true or false.

== Table of binary truth functions ==

In two-valued logic, there are sixteen possible truth functions, also called [[Boolean function]]s, of two inputs ''P'' and ''Q''. Any of these functions corresponds to a truth table of a certain [[logical connective]] in classical logic, including several [[degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate]] cases such as a function not depending on one or both of its arguments. Truth and falsehood is denoted as 1 and 0 in the following truth tables, respectively, for sake of brevity.

==Functional completeness==
{{see also|Functional completeness}}

Because a function may be expressed as a [[composition of functions|composition]], a truth-functional logical calculus does not need to have dedicated symbols for all of the above-mentioned functions to be [[functional completeness|functionally complete]]. This is expressed in a [[propositional calculus]] as [[logical equivalence]] of certain compound statements. For example, classical logic has {{math|¬''P'' ∨ ''Q''}} equivalent to {{math|''P'' → ''Q''}}. The conditional operator "→" is therefore not necessary for a classical-based [[logical system]] if "¬" (not) and "∨" (or) are already in use.

A [[minimal element|minimal]] set of operators that can express every statement expressible in the [[propositional calculus]] is called a ''minimal functionally complete set''. A minimally complete set of operators is achieved by NAND alone {↑} and NOR alone {↓}.

The following are the minimal functionally complete sets of operators whose arities do not exceed 2:&lt;ref name="Wernick"&gt;Wernick, William (1942) "Complete Sets of Logical Functions," ''Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 51'': 117&amp;ndash;32. In his list on the last page of the article, Wernick does not distinguish between ← and →, or between &lt;math&gt;\nleftarrow&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
;One element: {↑}, {↓}.
;Two elements: &lt;math&gt;\{\vee, \neg\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\wedge, \neg\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\to, \neg\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\gets, \neg\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\to, \bot\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\gets, \bot\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\to, \nleftrightarrow\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\gets, \nleftrightarrow\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\to, \nrightarrow\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\to, \nleftarrow\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\gets, \nrightarrow\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\gets, \nleftarrow\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\nrightarrow, \neg\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\nleftarrow, \neg\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\nrightarrow, \top\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\nleftarrow, \top\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\nrightarrow, \leftrightarrow\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\nleftarrow, \leftrightarrow\}&lt;/math&gt;.
;Three elements: &lt;math&gt;\{\lor, \leftrightarrow, \bot\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\lor, \leftrightarrow, \nleftrightarrow\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\lor, \nleftrightarrow, \top\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\land, \leftrightarrow, \bot\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\land, \leftrightarrow, \nleftrightarrow\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{\land, \nleftrightarrow, \top\}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Algebraic properties==
Some truth functions possess properties which may be expressed in the theorems containing the corresponding connective. Some of those properties that a binary truth function (or a corresponding logical connective) may have are:

*'''[[associativity]]''': Within an expression containing two or more of the same associative connectives in a row, the order of the operations does not matter as long as the sequence of the operands is not changed.
*'''[[commutativity]]''': The operands of the connective may be swapped without affecting the truth-value of the expression.
*'''[[distributivity]]''': A connective denoted by · distributes over another connective denoted by +, if ''a'' · (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' · ''b'') + (''a'' · ''c'') for all operands ''a'', ''b'', ''c''.
*'''[[idempotence]]''': Whenever the operands of the operation are the same, the connective gives the operand as the result. In other words, the operation is both truth-preserving and falsehood-preserving (see below).
*'''[[Absorption Law|absorption]]''': A pair of connectives &lt;math&gt;\land, \lor&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the absorption law if &lt;math&gt;a\land(a\lor b)=a&lt;/math&gt; for all operands ''a'', ''b''.

A set of truth functions is [[functional completeness|functionally complete]] if and only if for each of the following five properties it contains at least one member lacking it:
*'''[[monotonic]]''': If ''f''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≤ ''f''(''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) for all ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ {0,1} such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. E.g., &lt;math&gt;\vee, \wedge, \top, \bot&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''[[affine transformation|affine]]''': For each variable, changing its value either always or never changes the truth-value of the operation, for all fixed values of all other variables. E.g., &lt;math&gt;\neg, \leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\not\leftrightarrow, \top, \bot&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''self dual''': To read the truth-value assignments for the operation from top to bottom on its [[truth table]] is the same as taking the complement of reading it from bottom to top; in other words, ''f''(¬''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ¬''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ¬''f''(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;). E.g., &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;.
*'''truth-preserving''': The interpretation under which all variables are assigned a [[truth value]] of 'true' produces a truth value of 'true' as a result of these operations. E.g., &lt;math&gt;\vee, \wedge, \top, \rightarrow, \leftrightarrow, \subset&lt;/math&gt;. (see [[Validity (logic)|validity]])
*'''falsehood-preserving''': The interpretation under which all variables are assigned a [[truth value]] of 'false' produces a truth value of 'false' as a result of these operations. E.g., &lt;math&gt;\vee, \wedge, \nleftrightarrow, \bot, \not\subset, \not\supset&lt;/math&gt;. (see [[Validity (logic)|validity]])

===Arity===
{{see also|arity}}

A concrete function may be also referred to as an ''operator''. In two-valued logic there are 2 nullary operators (constants), 4 [[unary operation|unary operators]], 16 [[binary operation|binary operators]], 256 [[ternary operation|ternary operators]], and &lt;math&gt;2^{2^n}&lt;/math&gt; ''n''-ary operators. In three-valued logic there are 3 nullary operators (constants), 27 [[unary operation|unary operators]], 19683 [[binary operation|binary operators]], 7625597484987 [[ternary operation|ternary operators]], and &lt;math&gt;3^{3^n}&lt;/math&gt; ''n''-ary operators. In ''k''-valued logic, there are ''k'' nullary operators, &lt;math&gt;k^k&lt;/math&gt; unary operators, &lt;math&gt;k^{k^2}&lt;/math&gt; binary operators, &lt;math&gt;k^{k^3}&lt;/math&gt; ternary operators, and &lt;math&gt;k^{k^n}&lt;/math&gt; ''n''-ary operators. An ''n''-ary operator in ''k''-valued logic is a function from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_k^n \to \mathbb{Z}_k&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the number of such operators is &lt;math&gt;|\mathbb{Z}_k|^{|\mathbb{Z}_k^n|} = k^{k^n}&lt;/math&gt;, which is how the above numbers were derived.

However, some of the operators of a particular arity are actually degenerate forms that perform a lower-arity operation on some of the inputs and ignores the rest of the inputs. Out of the 256 ternary boolean operators cited above, &lt;math&gt;\binom{3}{2}\cdot 16 - \binom{3}{1}\cdot 4 + \binom{3}{0}\cdot 2&lt;/math&gt; of them are such degenerate forms of binary or lower-arity operators, using the [[inclusion–exclusion principle]]. The ternary operator &lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z)=\lnot x&lt;/math&gt; is one such operator which is actually a unary operator applied to one input, and ignoring the other two inputs.

[[Negation|"Not"]] is a [[unary operation|unary operator]], it takes a single term (¬''P''). The rest are [[binary operation|binary operators]], taking two terms to make a compound statement (''P'' &amp;and; ''Q'', ''P'' &amp;or; ''Q'', ''P'' → ''Q'', ''P'' ↔ ''Q'').

The set of logical operators {{math|&amp;Omega;}} may be [[Partition of a set|partition]]ed into disjoint subsets as follows:

::: &lt;math&gt;\Omega = \Omega_0 \cup \Omega_1 \cup \ldots \cup \Omega_j \cup \ldots \cup \Omega_m \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In this partition, &lt;math&gt;\Omega_j&lt;/math&gt; is the set of operator symbols of ''[[arity]]'' {{mvar|j}}.

In the more familiar propositional calculi, &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is typically partitioned as follows:

:::nullary operators: &lt;math&gt;\Omega_0 = \{\bot, \top \} &lt;/math&gt;

:::unary operators: &lt;math&gt;\Omega_1 = \{ \lnot \} &lt;/math&gt;

:::binary operators: &lt;math&gt;\Omega_2 \subseteq \{ \land, \lor, \rightarrow, \leftrightarrow \} &lt;/math&gt;

==Principle of compositionality==

Instead of using [[truth table]]s, logical connective symbols can be interpreted by means of an interpretation function and a functionally complete set of truth-functions (Gamut 1991), as detailed by the [[principle of compositionality]] of meaning.
Let ''I'' be an interpretation function, let ''Φ'', ''Ψ'' be any two sentences and let the truth function ''f''&lt;sub&gt;nand&lt;/sub&gt; be defined as:
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;nand&lt;/sub&gt;(T,T) = F; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;nand&lt;/sub&gt;(T,F) = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;nand&lt;/sub&gt;(F,T) = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;nand&lt;/sub&gt;(F,F) = T

Then, for convenience, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;not&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;or&lt;/sub&gt; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;and&lt;/sub&gt; and so on are defined by means of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;nand&lt;/sub&gt;:

* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;not&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;nand&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''x'')
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;or&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''y'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;nand&lt;/sub&gt;(''f''&lt;sub&gt;not&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), ''f''&lt;sub&gt;not&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''))
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;and&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''y'') = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;not&lt;/sub&gt;(''f''&lt;sub&gt;nand&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''y''))

or, alternatively ''f''&lt;sub&gt;not&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;or&lt;/sub&gt; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;and&lt;/sub&gt; and so on are defined directly:

* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;not&lt;/sub&gt;(T) = F; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;not&lt;/sub&gt;(F) = T;
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;or&lt;/sub&gt;(T,T) = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;or&lt;/sub&gt;(T,F) = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;or&lt;/sub&gt;(F,T) = T; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;or&lt;/sub&gt;(F,F) = F
* ''f''&lt;sub&gt;and&lt;/sub&gt;(T,T) = T; ''f''&lt;sub&gt;and&lt;/sub&gt;(T,F) = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;and&lt;/sub&gt;(F,T) = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;and&lt;/sub&gt;(F,F) = F

Then
{{Bulleted list|style=font-family: "Nimbus Roman No9 L", "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
| ''I''(~) {{=}} ''I''({{not}}) {{=}} ''f''&lt;sub&gt;not&lt;/sub&gt;
| ''I''(&amp;) {{=}} ''I''({{and}}) {{=}} ''f''&lt;sub&gt;and&lt;/sub&gt;
| ''I''(''v'') {{=}} ''I''({{or-}}) {{=}} ''f''&lt;sub&gt;or&lt;/sub&gt;
| ''I''(~''Φ'') {{=}} ''I''({{not}}''Φ'') {{=}} ''I''({{not}})(''I''(''Φ'')) {{=}} ''f''&lt;sub&gt;not&lt;/sub&gt;(''I''(''Φ''))
| ''I''(''Φ''{{and}}''Ψ'') {{=}} ''I''({{and}})(''I''(''Φ''), ''I''(''Ψ'')) {{=}} ''f''&lt;sub&gt;and&lt;/sub&gt;(''I''(''Φ''), ''I''(''Ψ''))
}}
etc.

Thus if ''S'' is a sentence that is a string of symbols consisting of logical symbols ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; representing logical connectives, and non-logical symbols ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, then if and only if {{math|size=100%|''I''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)...''I''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} have been provided interpreting ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; by means of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;nand&lt;/sub&gt; (or any other set of functional complete truth-functions) then the truth-value of {{tmath|I(s)}} is determined entirely by the truth-values of ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. of {{math|size=100%|''I''(''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)...''I''(''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.  In other words, as expected and required, ''S'' is true or false only under an interpretation of all its non-logical symbols.

==Computer science==
Logical operators are implemented as [[logic gate]]s in [[digital circuit]]s. Practically all digital circuits (the major exception is [[DRAM]]) are built up from [[logical nand|NAND]], [[logical nor|NOR]], [[negation|NOT]], and [[logic gate|transmission gate]]s. NAND and NOR gates with 3 or more inputs rather than the usual 2 inputs are fairly common, although they are logically equivalent to a cascade of 2-input gates. All other operators are implemented by breaking them down into a logically equivalent combination of 2 or more of the above logic gates.

The "logical equivalence" of "NAND alone", "NOR alone", and "NOT and AND" is similar to [[Turing equivalence (theory of computation)|Turing equivalence]].

The fact that all truth functions can be expressed with NOR alone is demonstrated by the [[Apollo guidance computer]].

'''Women's fear of crime''' refers to women's fear of being a victim of crime, independent of actual [[Victimisation|victimization]]. Although [[fear of crime]] is a concern for people of all genders, studies consistently find that women around the world tend to have much higher levels of fear of crime than men, despite the fact that in many places, and for most offenses, men's actual victimization rates are higher.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanko|first=Elizabeth A.|date=1995|title=Women, Crime, and Fear|jstor=1048395|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=539|pages=46–58|doi=10.1177/0002716295539001004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Gender of Crime|last=Britton|first=Dana|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4422-0970-1|location=Lanham, MD|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of crime is related to perceived risk of victimization, but is not the same; fear of crime may be generalized instead of referring to specific offenses, and perceived risk may also be considered a demographic factor that contributes to fear of crime. Women tend to have higher levels for both perceived risk and fear of crime.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snedker|first=Karen A.|date=2015|title=Neighborhood Conditions and Fear of Crime A Reconsideration of Sex Differences|url=http://cad.sagepub.com/content/61/1/45|journal=Crime &amp; Delinquency|language=en|volume=61|issue=1|pages=45–70|doi=10.1177/0011128710389587|issn=0011-1287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Addington|first=Lynn A.|title=Fear of Crime and Perceived Risk|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/display/id/obo-9780195396607-0051|journal=Oxford Bibliographies Online Datasets|doi=10.1093/obo/9780195396607-0051|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In women's everyday lives, fear of crime can have negative effects, such as reducing their environmental mobility. Studies have shown that women tend to avoid certain behaviors, such as walking alone at night, because they are fearful of crime, and would feel more comfortable with these behaviors if they felt safer.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keane|first=Carl|date=1998|title=Evaluating the Influence of Fear of Crime as an Environmental Mobility Restrictor on Women's Routine Activities|url=http://eab.sagepub.com/content/30/1/60|journal=Environment and Behavior|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=60–74|doi=10.1177/0013916598301003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories on women's fear of crime ==
Social scientists have differing views on the causes of women's fear of crime. Some have argued that women's heightened fear of crime is due to women's higher levels physical vulnerability compared to men, although [[Feminism|feminist]] work generally resists this generalization and often tries to relocate the cause to larger societal factors.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Coping with Crime: Individual and Neighborhood Reactions|last=Skogan|first=Wesley G.|last2=Maxfield|first2=Michael G.|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1981|isbn=0-8039-1632-9|series=Sage Library of Social Research 124|location=Beverly Hills, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is nonetheless important that most women are aware of pervasive cultural view that women are more vulnerable than men, which may make them think they are more likely to be victimized and therefore contribute to their fear; in this way, it would be perceived vulnerability and not actual vulnerability that is the cause of women's fear.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Some research has also suggested that women are in fact not much more fearful about crime than men, but that dominant cultural ideas about masculinity may make men reluctant to talk about their fear or report it in surveys.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilchrist|first=Elizabeth|last2=Bannister|first2=Jon|last3=Ditton|first3=Jason|last4=Farrall|first4=Stephen|date=1998|title=Women and the 'fear of crime': challenging the accepted stereotype|url=|journal=British Journal of Criminology|issue=38.2|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminist Theory ===
Feminist discourse on fear of crime tends to explain women's higher levels of fear with the [[Patriarchy|unequal gender structure]] in most societies, which places women beneath men within the power structure and thus puts them especially at risk for victimization by men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This theory refers to the oppressive [[social control]] of women, arguing that some crimes against women (such as rape) and the socialization that women receive to feel vulnerable and fear male violence are used by the patriarchy to assert male dominance and "keep women in their place."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Rape and fear of crime ==
As rape is by far the most gendered crime by victimization, some feminist scholars have suggested that fear of rape is the most important and most unique element of women's fear of crime, or even that women's fear of crime is in fact a generalized fear of rape.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warr|first=Mark|date=1984|title=Fear of Victimisation: Why Are Women and the Elderly More Afraid?|url=|journal=Social Science Quarterly|issue=65|pages=681–702|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Female Fear|last=Gordon|first=Margaret T.|last2=Riger|first2=Stephanie|publisher=The Free Press|year=1989|isbn=0-02-912490-5|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this theory, often referred to as the "shadow of sexual assault hypothesis," often note that women tend to fear that rape will co-occur with other crimes, such as burglary, a fear that is not found among men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferraro|first=Kenneth F.|date=1996|title=Women's fear of victimization: shadow of sexual assault?|url=|journal=Social Forces|issue=2|doi=10.1093/sf/75.2.667|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chui|first=Wing Hong|last2=Cheng|first2=Kevin Kwok-Yin|last3=Wong|first3=Lok-Ping|date=2013|title=Gender, Fear of Crime, and Attitudes Toward Prisoners Among Social Work Majors in a Hong Kong University|url=http://ijo.sagepub.com/content/57/4/479|journal=International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology|language=|volume=57|issue=4|pages=479–494|doi=10.1177/0306624X12436524|issn=0306-624X|pmid=22334610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some supporters of the theory also note that sexual harassment, which most women will experience in their lifetimes, especially contributes to the fear of rape; in some cases, women's rejection of unwanted sexual advances leads to threats, and even "benevolent" harassment may increase women's wariness and fear of men in public spaces.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The fear of rape, unlike other fears of specific crimes, is almost exclusive to women.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Among women, it is also one of the strongest crime-related fears, and is the strongest crime-related fear for young women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Levels of fear of rape vary among women by age, race/ethnicity, residential area, and other factors, but are especially high for women who have been victims of rape in the past or know victims personally (the latter group may include a significant portion of women, with one study estimating that over half of women know rape victims).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The fear of rape may also be related to the fear of murder, as women tend to overestimate the proportion of rape victims who are murdered during their attacks. Stigma and blame are also factors: what many feminists refer to as the "[[rape myth]]," the popular idea that women can be blamed for their rape and that women are responsible for preventing rape by the regulation of their behavior, often serves to support the fear of rape.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Demographic differences in women's fear of crime ==
Although women as a whole demographic are more fearful of crime, specific subgroups of women may have higher levels of fear or be more likely to change their behavior because of it. In many studies, the demographics found to have the highest generalized fear of crime are single, older, urban, women of color, and of lower socioeconomic class.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For fear of victimization for specific crimes, the demographics with the highest levels of fear may be different.

=== Geography ===
Generally, research has demonstrated that women from urban areas have higher levels of fear of crime. Even within cities, fear levels may differ from neighborhood to neighborhood. Increased social disorganization in the neighborhood (as measured by homelessness, drug sales, vandalism, prostitution, etc.) and higher rates of neighborhood serious crime lead to higher levels of fear of crime for both men and women, but both factors have a stronger effect on women's fear of crime.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Urban and rural communities tend to have very different levels of fear of crime. Rural areas are almost always perceived by residents and outsiders as safer, so it is often assumed that fear of crime levels will be lower there. Still, 2005 research in New Zealand and the United Kingdom noted that fear of crime levels in rural areas is on the rise, and found that sources of fear of crime among rural women often include perceived encroachment of urban influence (through people or attitudes) into their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Little|first=Jo|last2=Panelli|first2=Ruth|last3=Kraack|first3=Anna|date=2005|title=Women's fear of crime: A rural perspective|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074301670500015X|journal=Journal of Rural Studies|volume=21|issue=2|pages=151–163|doi=10.1016/j.jrurstud.2005.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race/Ethnicity ===
Theorists have suggested that Black and Latina women, and women of color in general, in the United States may have higher rates of fear of crime due to increased [[social vulnerability]]; because of institutional racism and sexism against women of color, their identities may put them at greater risk of victimization, leading to higher levels of fear.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Solutions to women's fear of crime ==
In general, proposed solutions to women's fear of crime either place the responsibility on individual women (through preventive strategies) or on official agencies (through infrastructure improvements, anti-rape education, more involved policing, etc.), and are often framed as a combination of both.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hickey|first=Georgina|date=2011|title=From Civility to Self-Defense: Modern Advice to Women on the Privileges and Dangers of Public Space|jstor=41290280|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|volume=39|issue=1/2|pages=77–94|doi=10.1353/wsq.2011.0021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those that expect women to protect themselves from crime, most focus on the dangers for women in public spaces; however, as women usually face their highest rates of victimization in the home or at the hands of known people, these campaigns have been suggested to be particularly ill-equipped to help solve the problem of women's high fear of crime, and to support an untrue picture of women's victimization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of the most common individual strategies for dealing with fear of crime and preventing victimization is simple avoidance, the attempt to stay away from areas (such as dark alleys or public transportation) where it is believed victimization is likely to occur; research has found that women employ avoidance strategies more often than men do.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Avoided areas may include neighborhoods with high crime rates, but for many women also include any unfamiliar areas. Women may also employ other isolation strategies by avoiding social interaction with strangers, ignoring them or moving quickly and with purpose to discourage interaction&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nothing Bad Happens to Good Girls: Fear of Crime in Women's Lives|last=Madriz|first=Esther|publisher=University of California Press|year=1997|isbn=0-520-20855-2|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common method of allaying fear of crime among women is by "crime-proofing" homes or possessions. Popular examples include home security systems, locking away valuables, or participating in [[Neighborhood watch|neighborhood watch programs]]. These strategies are used by people of all genders, but some are more often employed by women. For example, many women in an American study reported choosing purses with zippers or holding purses protectively to defend against [[theft]] and purse-snatching.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

As interest in women's safety and women's fear of crime has increased, so has interest in precautionary strategies; for example, in the past few decades, women's [[self-defense]] classes, books, and other self-defense instruction have become increasingly popular.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some women also choose to carry weapons, such as knives or guns, or repellents like [[pepper spray]] and [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] to ward off potential attackers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Feminist commentators usually take the view that the responsibility for reducing women's fear of crime lies with the society, and that fear must be combatted at its source by addressing men's violence against women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Women's fear of crime around the world ==
Although most research on women's fear of crime has been done in English-speaking countries, with the most done in the United States, similar trends in women's fear of crime have been found around the world.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karakus|first=Onder|last2=McGarrell|first2=Edmund F.|last3=Basibuyuk|first3=Oguzhan|date=2010|title=Fear of crime among citizens of Turkey|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235210000267|journal=Journal of Criminal Justice|volume=38|issue=2|pages=174–184|doi=10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2010.02.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===
A 2014 study using data from 20 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa concluded that fear of crime has a stronger negative effect on women's subjective well-being compared to men's, with subjective wellbeing defined as self-reported satisfaction with life. In the study, fear of crime had a statistically significant correlation with subjective wellbeing for females, but no significant correlation for males, suggesting that for the men in the study, fear of crime was not an important factor in determining their happiness and life satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sulemana|first=Iddisah|date=2014|title=The Effect of Fear of Crime and Crime Victimization on Subjective Well-Being in Africa|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-014-0660-4|journal=Social Indicators Research|language=en|volume=121|issue=3|pages=849–872|doi=10.1007/s11205-014-0660-4|issn=0303-8300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===
A 2013 study of Hong Kong social work students found significant gender differences in fear of crime levels. Consistent with the shadow of sexual assault hypothesis, the study found that the women had the highest levels of fear for rape, and that fear of rape was a predictor for fear of other crimes. Hong Kong has one of the lowest rates of crime and victimization in the world, so this study may suggest that the presence and size of gender differences in fear of crime are not strongly correlated with total crime and victimization rates.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Europe ===
A 1998 study in Glasgow, Scotland, found a gender disparity in fear of crime levels smaller than what is generally accepted. The study also found that men and women with similar fear levels tended to use similar reasoning to explain their fear of crime or lack of fear, although men's and women's fear appeared in different situations (men tended to be more often fearful about property crime, whereas women were more fearful about violent crime).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Middle East ===
A 2010 Turkish study using a large nationwide sample confirmed that women expressed significantly higher levels of fear of crime than men. The study also found that previous victimization, a consistent predictor for higher levels of fear in women, was present at close to equal rates in the male and female samples, suggesting that prior victimization has a stronger effect on women's fear of crime than on men's. Also, if the study's sample is representative of the Turkish population, women have slightly higher victimization rates than men, and so their fear does not reflect the "gender-fear paradox" of victimization found in many other developed countries.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4686">'''Yakay-Der''' ({{lang-tr|Yakınlarını Kaybeden Ailelerle Yardımlaşma ve Dayanışma Derneği}}; "The Association of Solidarity and Assistance for the Families of Missing Persons") is a Turkish activist group. It was founded on 9 March 2001 to help the families of [[forced disappearance|disappeared Kurds]] in Turkey. 

According to Yakar-Der, more than 1,500 persons are unaccounted for following the "special war" period in Turkey from 1993 to 1998, in the context of actions taken to root out the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]]. These activities were brought to light in the [[Susurluk scandal]] which surfaced in 1996 and resulted in several high-level resignations in the Turkish Government.

==About==
The President of Yakar-Der is [[Pervin Buldan]]. 

Its stated objectives are:

* To investigate the unknown killings of known opponents of the State and the disappearance of such people under very suspicious situations and circumstances;
* To investigate and try to find out who are responsible for the unknown killings and/or disappearances of such activists, and to bring them to book, i.e. to make certain that they are arrested, prosecuted and punished; and
*To work with the families of those who have been killed or who have disappeared.

==History==
Yakar-Der was established as a result of a long struggle organised by what came to be known as the [[Saturday Mothers]], a group of women who protested every Saturday for about two years in front of the [[Galatasaray High School]] in [[Taksim Square|Taksim]] in [[Istanbul]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report and recommendations on the Kurdish question in Turkey|publisher=International delegation of Human Rights Lawyers|year=2005|url=http://www.freedom-for-ocalan.com/english/download/REPORT%20AND%20RECOMMENDATIONS%20ON%20THE%20KURDISH%20QUESTION%20IN%20TURKEY,%20%20BY%20THE%20INTERNATIONAL%20%20DELEGATION%20OF%20HUMAN%20RIGHTS%20LAWYERS_%20JANUARY%202005.pdf|accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a successor to the Association '''Mag-Der''', which was closed down by the Turkish authorities because of alleged irregularities with respect to  the Turkish Law of Associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Fondation du Yakar-Der|publisher=ICAD|date=December 2005|url=http://www.icad-committee.com/html/francais/02/fr_conference05/fr_informacionYAKAY.htm|accessdate=2009-08-16}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, Yakar-Der, together with the [[Human Rights Association (Turkey)|Turkish Human Rights Association]] (İHD) and the International Committee Against Disappearances (ICAD), organise a series of special events to mark the Week of Disappeared People. In May 2006, they organised the 5th International Conference against Disappearances, in [[Diyarbakir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conference programme

In 2008 they organized sit-down strikes, a photo exhibition and panel discussions with the relatives of missing persons. They also filed a complaint with the public prosecutor and demanded the punishment of officials responsible for the disappearance of the missing persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkey: Some 800 victims of enforced disappearance remembered|publisher=Today's Zaman|date=2008-05-25|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=142608|accessdate=2009-08-16}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, they began a campaign to urge Turkey to ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NGOs seek ratification of convention on disappeared persons |publisher=Today's Zaman |date=2009-05-23 |url=http://todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=176075 |accessdate=2009-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713204549/http://todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=176075 |archivedate=July 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
