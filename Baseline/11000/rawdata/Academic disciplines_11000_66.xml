'''50 Things That Made the Modern Economy''' began as a weekly economic history [[Radio documentary|documentary radio]] series on the [[BBC World Service]] presented by economist and journalist [[Tim Harford]]. The first episode was broadcast on Saturday 5 November 2016, and all episodes are available as [[podcast]]s.

Harford explained his motivation "to paint a picture of economic change by telling the stories of the ideas, people, and tools that had far-reaching consequences". He was fascinated by the many unexpected outcomes, such as "the impact of the fridge on global politics, or of the gramophone on income inequality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/51st-thing-that-made-the-modern-economy "BBC World Service invites suggestions for the ’51st Thing’ that made the modern economy"], ''[[BBC World Service]]'', 19 August 2017. Retrieved on 10 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was subsequently released by Harford as a book titled '''Fifty Things That Made The Modern Economy''' in the UK published by [[Little, Brown Book Group|Little, Brown Books]], and as '''Fifty Inventions That Shaped The Modern Economy''' in the US published by [[Riverhead Books]]. The hardcover and eBook editions were released on 6 July 2017 in the UK and the US edition was released on 29 August 2017. A paperback edition has been announced for May 2018.

A public call was made for suggestions for a '''51st thing''' in August 2017. Harford chose his six favourite submissions for an online vote from late September to 6 October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4Y4Gn8gbQvp4X87wGLV3n4N/vote-for-the-51st-thing|title=Vote for the 51st Thing!|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005133320/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4Y4Gn8gbQvp4X87wGLV3n4N/vote-for-the-51st-thing|archive-date=5 October 2017|dead-url=|access-date=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winning item was announced as the [[Credit Card]] in an episode released on 28 October 2017.

Each of the nine-minute long programmes introduces the story of fifty products or inventions that have revolutionised the modern world.

Each episode was originally broadcast on BBC World Service, with a subsequent broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] and distribution as a BBC podcast.

'''Advanced Placement Human Geography''' (also known as '''AP Human Geo''', '''AP Geography''', '''APHG''', '''AP HuGe''', '''HGAP''', '''AP HuGs''', '''APHUG''', '''AP HUMAN''', or '''High School Ap Human''') is an [[Advanced Placement]] [[social studies]] course that studies [[human geography]]. The test is administered by [[College Board]].

This college-level course introduces students to the systematic study of patterns and processes that have shaped human understanding, use, and alteration of [[Earth]]'s surface. Students employ spatial concepts and landscape analyses to analyze human social organization and its environmental consequences. They also learn about the methods and tools geographers use in their science and practice.

== Exam ==
The AP Human Geography Exam consists of two sections. The first section consists of 75 [[multiple choice]] questions and the second section consists of 3 free-response questions. The sections are 60 and 75 minutes long, respectively. It is not necessary to answer the free-response questions in essay form; instead, points are awarded on certain key words, examples, and other vital aspects.

The topics covered by the exam are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap-human-geography-course-description.pdf AP Human Geography:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==AP Human Geography==
The curriculum consists of informational book-related homework, which often requires students to strive to learn information independently. The curriculum teaches about diffusion, human traits, religion, and population clusters.

In [[social science]], '''antipositivism''' (also '''interpretivism''' or '''negativism''') is a theoretical stance that proposes that the social realm cannot be studied with the [[scientific method]] of investigation applied to the [[Nature|natural world]] and that investigation of the social realm requires a different [[epistemology]]. Fundamental to this epistemology is the belief that the concepts and language researchers bring to their research shape their perception of the social world under investigation.&lt;ref name="7th Canadian"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Macionis |first1=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda M. |title=Sociology |publisher=Pearson Canada |location=Toronto |isbn=978-0-13-700161-3 |page=32 |edition=7th Canadian|year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept ==

Interpretivism (anti-positivism) developed among researchers dissatisfied with [[post-positivism]], the theories of which they considered too general and ill-suited to reflect the nuance and variability found in human interaction. Because the values and theoretical beliefs of researchers cannot fully be removed from their inquiry, interpretivists believe research ''on'' human beings ''by'' human beings cannot yield objective results. Thus, rather than seeking an objective perspective, interpretivists look for meaning in the subjective experiences of individuals engaging in social interaction. Many interpretivist researchers immerse themselves in the social context they are studying, seeking to understand and formulate theories about a community or group of individuals by observing from the inside. Interpretivism is an inductive practice influenced by philosophical frameworks such as [[hermeneutics]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and [[symbolic interactionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, K. (2004). Interpretive Perspectives on Theory Development. In Communication Theories: Perspectives, Processes, and Contexts (pp. 46–59). Boston, Massachusetts: McGraw-Hill.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Beginning with [[Giambattista Vico]], in the early eighteenth century, and later with [[Montesquieu]], the study of natural history and human history were separate fields of intellectual enquiry. Natural history is not under human control, whereas human history is a human creation. As such, antipositivism is informed by an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] distinction between the natural world and the social realm. The natural world can only be understood by its external characteristics, whereas the social realm can be understood externally and internally, and thus can be known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Knowledge and Social Structure|last = Hamilton|first = Peter|publisher = Routledge and Kegan Paul|year = 1974|isbn = 978-0710077462|location = London|pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early nineteenth century, intellectuals, led by the [[Hegelian]]s, questioned the prospect of empirical social analysis.{{clarify|date=January 2017}}{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} [[Karl Marx]] died before the establishment of formal social science, but nonetheless rejected the [[sociological positivism]] of [[Auguste Comte]]—despite his attempt to establish an [[historical materialist]] science of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Zbigniew A. |last=Jordan |title=The Evolution of Dialectical Materialism: A Philosophical and Sociological Analysis |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York, NY, USA |year=1967 |pages=131, 321 |isbn=}} [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/jordan2.htm] [https://books.google.com/?id=l2MHAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22science+of+society%22#search_anchor]&lt;/ref&gt;

The enhanced positivism of [[Émile Durkheim]] served as foundation of modern academic [[sociology]] and [[social research]], yet retained many mechanical elements of its predecessor.{{clarify|date=July 2014}} [[Hermeneutic]]ians such as [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] theorized in detail on the distinction between natural and social science ('[[Geisteswissenschaft]]'), whilst [[neo-Kantian]] philosophers such as [[Heinrich Rickert]] maintained that the social realm, with its abstract meanings and symbolisms, is inconsistent with scientific methods of analysis. [[Edmund Husserl]], meanwhile, negated positivism through the rubric of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p. 20-5&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the twentieth century, the first wave of German sociologists formally introduced ''verstehende'' (interpretive) sociological antipositivism, proposing research should concentrate on human cultural [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]s, [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[symbols]], and social processes viewed from a resolutely [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]] perspective{{clarify|date=June 2014}}. As an antipositivist, however, one seeks relationships that are not as "ahistorical, invariant, or generalizable"&lt;ref name="Classical Statements6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, USA |year=2005 |page=241 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2014}} as those pursued by natural scientists.

The interaction between theory (or constructed [[concept]]s) and data is always fundamental in [[social science]] and this subjection distinguishes it from physical science{{According to whom|date=June 2014}}. Durkheim himself noted the importance of constructing concepts in the abstract (e.g. "[[collective consciousness]]" and "[[social anomie]]") in order to form workable categories for experimentation{{clarify|date=June 2014}}. Both Weber and [[Georg Simmel]] pioneered the [[verstehen]] (or 'interpretative') approach toward social science; a systematic process in which an outside observer attempts to relate to a particular cultural group, or indigenous people, on their own terms and from their own point of view.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

|text = ''[Sociology is ]'' ... the science whose object is to interpret ''the meaning of social action'' and thereby give a ''causal explanation'' of the way in which the ''action proceeds'' and the ''effects which it produces''. By 'action' in this definition is meant the human behaviour when and to the extent the agent or agents see it as ''subjectively meaningful'' ... the meaning to which we refer may be either (a) the meaning actually intended either by an individual agent on a particular historical occasion or by a number of agents on an approximate average in a given set of cases, or (b) the meaning attributed to the agent or agents, as types, in a pure type constructed in the abstract. In neither case is the 'meaning' thought of as somehow objectively 'correct' or 'true' by some metaphysical criterion. This is the difference between the empirical sciences of action, such as sociology and history, and any kind of ''a priori'' discipline, such as jurisprudence, logic, ethics, or aesthetics whose aim is to extract from their subject-matter 'correct' or 'valid' meaning.
|sign = [[Max Weber]]
|source = The Nature of Social Action 1922&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max ''The Nature of Social Action'' in Runciman, W.G. 'Weber: Selections in Translation' Cambridge University Press, 1991. p7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Through the work of Simmel, in particular, sociology acquired a possible character beyond positivist data-collection or grand, deterministic systems of structural law. Relatively isolated from the sociological academy throughout his lifetime, Simmel presented idiosyncratic analyses of modernity more reminiscent of the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and [[Existentialism|existential]] writers than of Comte or Durkheim, paying particular concern to the forms of, and possibilities for, social individuality.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Donald (ed) 'Simmel: On individuality and social forms' Chicago University Press, 1971. pxix.&lt;/ref&gt; His sociology engaged in a [[neo-Kantian]] critique of the limits of human perception.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Donald (ed) 'Simmel: On individuality and social forms' Chicago University Press, 1971. p6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antipositivism thus holds there is no methodological unity of the sciences: the three goals of positivism - ''description, control, and prediction'' - are incomplete, since they lack any ''understanding''.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Science aims at understanding causality so control can be exerted. If this succeeded in sociology, those with knowledge would be able to control the ignorant and this could lead to [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]].{{According to whom|date=July 2014}}

This perspective has led to controversy over how one can draw the line between [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] research, much less draw an artificial line between environment and human organization (see [[environmental sociology]]), and influenced the study of [[hermeneutics]]. The base concepts of antipositivism have expanded beyond the scope of [[social science]], in fact, [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] has the same basic principles at its core. Simply put, positivists see sociology as a science, while anti-positivists do not.

=== Frankfurt School ===
The antipositivist tradition continued in the establishment of [[critical theory]], particularly the work associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] of social research. Antipositivism would be further facilitated by rejections of '[[scientism]]'; or science ''as ideology''. [[Jürgen Habermas]] argues, in his ''On the Logic of the Social Sciences'' (1967), that "the positivist thesis of unified science, which assimilates all the sciences to a natural-scientific model, fails because of the intimate relationship between the social sciences and history, and the fact that they are based on a situation-specific understanding of meaning that can be explicated only [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutically]] ... access to a symbolically prestructured reality cannot be gained by observation alone."&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Zygmunt Bauman]] argued that "our innate tendency to express moral concern and identify with the Other's wants is stifled in modernity by positivistic science and dogmatic bureaucracy. If the Other does not "fit in" to modernity's approved classifications, it is liable to be extinguished."&lt;ref&gt;John Scott. ''Fifty Key Sociologists: The Contemporary Theorists.'' Routledge. 2006. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5009">'''Aviation engineering''' is the science of designing, developing, and assembling aircraft. Aviation engineers focus on airspace development, airport design, aircraft navigation technologies, and aerodrome planning. Professionals working in this field experiment with innovations in technology and materials, test planes, simulate flight conditions, and more.

As a branch of law, it is art for it involves formulation of [[public policy]], regulations, aviation laws pertaining to [[airspace]], [[airline]]s, [[airport]]s, [[aerodrome]]s and the conduct of [[air services agreements]] through treaty.

This branch of [[engineering]] is distinct to [[aerospace engineering]] which deals with the science of flying craft and spacecraft.

==Airspace development==
The global airspace is divided into territorial airspace which then belongs to a [[country]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What is meant by international waters and airspace? {{!}} Find Laws, Legal Information, News &amp; Solicitors - Findlaw UK |url=http://findlaw.co.uk/law/government/other_law_and_government_topics/international_waters_and_international_airspace.html |website=Find Laws, Legal Information, News &amp; Solicitors - Findlaw UK |access-date=2016-02-02 |language=en-US |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301054920/http://findlaw.co.uk/law/government/other_law_and_government_topics/international_waters_and_international_airspace.html |archivedate=2016-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, airspace has to be engineered to benefit both military and civil users. Planning and designing airspace is important so as not to affect military operations and in order to designate air routes for commercial airlines to navigate freely without intervention by military authorities. For instance, not all of [[China]] can be used for commercial aeronautical navigation. Certain airspaces are designated as military-use only. Navigating outside commercial airspaces in the country may lead to risk of the astrayed aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = China To Continue Airspace Relaxation|url = http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2015-04-13/china-continue-airspace-relaxation|website = Aviation International News|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In prior years, airspace has been limited to military and air mail services. The advancement in aerospace engineering brought to fore aircraft designs that lead to the development of commercial airliners. Governments around the world concluded air rights for their respective airlines and their corresponding aircraft. Government saw the economic potential of airspace as a state enterprise. This rise in the development of commercial aviation led to the study of the complexities of aircraft (plane) management, airport design and construction, international air services agreements (treaties).

In recent years, the global airline industry has demanded that China should reform its aviation policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = REFILE-China aviation regulator to push for air space reform -paper|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/china-aviation-idUSL4N0XC2TM20150415|newspaper = Reuters|date = 2015-04-15|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airport design==
Recent designs of airports have been engineered to align with global environmental standards. Advancement in [[civil engineering]] and [[architecture]] make an interplay of the two disciplines.

==Career==
Governments around the world hire aviation engineers for all sorts of reasons. In the [[United States]], federal, state and local agencies all commonly employ aviation engineers for agencies such as the Department of Transportation. The Federal Aviation Administration, which is in charge of controlling aircraft navigation throughout the whole nation, maintaining navigation, licensing and certification for aviation engineers. FAA employs many aviation engineers to work on research and development problems, [[noise pollution]] and hypersonic aircraft among other things. 

Engineers are heavily involved in improving aviation technologies to support the advancement of military and commercial aviation. Aviation engineers are often employed in aerospace machine shops specializing in the technological advancement of aircraft parts and equipment. These shops produce aircraft components such as electrical connectors, oxygen generation systems, landing gear assemblies, and other pieces that require special attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Aerospace Machine Shop {{!}} Precision CNC machining {{!}} Ardel Engineering|url = http://www.ardelengineering.com/aircraft-aerospace|website = www.ardelengineering.com|access-date = 2016-02-02|first = |last = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aviation engineers do more than work on planes. Aviation engineers also play a large role in airport design. They provide guidance for the construction and daily running of the airports, as well as help in the operation and maintenance.

'''Chemical engineering''' is a branch of [[engineering]] that uses principles of [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]], and [[economics]] to efficiently use, produce, transform, and transport chemicals, materials, and energy. A chemical engineer designs large-scale processes that convert chemicals, raw materials, living cells, microorganisms, and energy into useful forms and products.

Chemical engineers are involved in many aspects of plant design and operation, including safety and hazard assessments, process design and analysis, [[control engineering]], [[chemical reaction engineering]], construction specification, and operating instructions.

==Etymology==
[[File:Davis GE.jpg|thumb|150px|[[George E. Davis]]]]

A 1996 ''[[British Journal for the History of Science]]'' article cites James F. Donnelly for mentioning an 1839 reference to chemical engineering in relation to the production of [[sulfuric acid]].{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=172}} In the same paper however, [[George E. Davis]], an English consultant, was credited for having coined the term.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=174}} Davis also tried to found a ''Society of Chemical Engineering'', but instead it was named the [[Society of Chemical Industry]] (1881), with Davis as its first Secretary.&lt;ref name="Swindin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swindin|first1=N.|title=George E. Davis memorial lecture|journal=Transactions of the Institution of Chemical Engineers|date=1953|volume=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flavell-While"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flavell-While|first1=Claudia|title=Chemical Engineers Who Changed the World: Meet the Daddy|url=http://www.thechemicalengineer.com/~/media/Documents/TCE/Articles/2012/849/849cewctw.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2016|work=The Chemical Engineer|agency=52-54|date=2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028085216/http://www.thechemicalengineer.com/~/media/Documents/TCE/Articles/2012/849/849cewctw.pdf|archivedate=28 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''History of Science in United States: An Encyclopedia'' puts the use of the term around 1890.{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=176}} "Chemical engineering", describing the use of mechanical equipment in the chemical industry, became common vocabulary in England after 1850.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=186}} By 1910, the profession, "chemical engineer," was already in common use in Britain and the United States.{{sfn|Perkins|2003|p=20}}

==History==
{{main|History of chemical engineering}} 
Chemical engineering emerged upon the development of [[unit operations]], a fundamental concept of the discipline of chemical engineering. Most authors agree that Davis invented the concept of unit operations if not substantially developed it.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|pp=172–173}} He gave a series of lectures on unit operations at the [[Manchester Technical School]] (later part of the [[University of Manchester]]) in 1887, considered to be one of the earliest such about chemical engineering.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=175}} Three years before Davis' lectures, [[Henry Edward Armstrong]] taught a degree course in chemical engineering at the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]]. Armstrong's course failed simply because its graduates ... were not especially attractive to employers. Employers of the time would have rather hired chemists and [[mechanical engineers]].{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=176}} Courses in chemical engineering offered by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in the United States, [[Owens College, Manchester|Owens College]] in [[Manchester]], England, and [[University College London]] suffered under similar circumstances.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=178}}

[[File:MIT Industrial Chemistry Lab.gif|thumb|Students inside an industrial chemistry laboratory at MIT|250px]]

Starting from 1888,{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=180}} [[Lewis M. Norton]] taught at MIT the first chemical engineering course in the United States. Norton's course was contemporaneous and essentially similar to Armstrong's course. Both courses, however, simply merged chemistry and engineering subjects along with product design. "Its practitioners had difficulty convincing engineers that they were engineers and chemists that they were not simply chemists."{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=176}} Unit operations was introduced into the course by [[William Hultz Walker]] in 1905.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=183}} By the early 1920s, unit operations became an important aspect of chemical engineering at MIT and other US universities, as well as at [[Imperial College London]].{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=184}} The [[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]] (AIChE), established in 1908, played a key role in making chemical engineering considered an independent science, and unit operations central to chemical engineering. For instance, it defined chemical engineering to be a "science of itself, the basis of which is ... unit operations" in a 1922 report; and with which principle, it had published a list of academic institutions which offered "satisfactory" chemical engineering courses.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=187}} Meanwhile, promoting chemical engineering as a distinct science in Britain lead to the establishment of the [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]] (IChemE) in 1922.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=189}} IChemE likewise helped make unit operations considered essential to the discipline.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=190}}

===New concepts and innovations===
By the 1940s, it became clear that unit operations alone were insufficient in developing [[chemical reactor]]s. While the predominance of unit operations in chemical engineering courses in Britain and the United States continued until the 1960s, [[Transport phenomena (engineering &amp; physics)|transport phenomena]] started to experience greater focus.{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=185}} Along with other novel concepts, such as [[process systems engineering]] (PSE), a "second paradigm" was defined.{{sfn|Ogawa|2007|p=2}}{{sfn|Perkins|2003|p=29}} Transport phenomena gave an [[systems analysis|analytical]] approach to chemical engineering{{sfn|Perkins|2003|p=30}} while PSE focused on its synthetic elements, such as [[control system]] and [[Process design (chemical engineering)|process design]].{{sfn|Perkins|2003|p=31}} Developments in chemical engineering before and after [[World War II]] were mainly incited by the [[petrochemical industry]],{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=177}} however, advances in other fields were made as well. Advancements in [[biochemical engineering]] in the 1940s, for example, found application in the [[pharmaceutical industry]], and allowed for the [[mass production]] of various [[antibiotic]]s, including [[penicillin]] and [[streptomycin]].{{sfn|Perkins|2003|pp=32–33}} Meanwhile, progress in [[polymer science]] in the 1950s paved way for the "age of plastics".{{sfn|Kim|2002|p=7S}}

===Safety and hazard developments===
Concerns regarding the safety and environmental impact of large-scale chemical manufacturing facilities were also raised during this period. ''[[Silent Spring]]'', published in 1962, alerted its readers to the harmful effects of [[DDT]], a potent [[insecticide]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The 1974 [[Flixborough disaster]] in the United Kingdom resulted in 28 deaths, as well as damage to a [[chemical plant]] and three nearby villages.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The 1984 [[Bhopal disaster]] in India resulted in almost 4,000 deaths.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} These incidents, along with [[List of industrial disasters|other incidents]], affected the reputation of the trade as [[industrial safety]] and [[environmental protection]] were given more focus.{{sfn|Kim|2002|p=8S}} In response, the IChemE required safety to be part of every degree course that it accredited after 1982. By the 1970s, legislation and monitoring agencies were instituted in various countries, such as France, Germany, and the United States.{{sfn|Perkins|2003|p=35}}

===Recent progress===
Advancements in [[computer science]] found applications designing and managing plants, simplifying calculations and drawings that previously had to be done manually. The completion of the [[Human Genome Project]] is also seen as a major development, not only advancing chemical engineering but [[genetic engineering]] and [[genomics]] as well.{{sfn|Kim|2002|p=9S}} Chemical engineering principles were used to produce [[DNA sequences]] in large quantities.{{sfn|American Institute of Chemical Engineers|2003a}}

==Concepts==
{{chemical engineering}}

Chemical engineering involves the application of several principles. Key concepts are presented below.

===Plant design and construction===
Chemical engineering design concerns the creation of plans, specification, and economic analyses for [[pilot plant]]s, new plants or plant modifications. Design engineers often work in a consulting role, designing plants to meet clients' needs. Design is limited by a number of factors, including funding, government regulations and safety standards. These constraints dictate a plant's choice of process, materials and equipment.{{sfn|Towler|Sinnott|2008|pp=2–3}}

Plant construction is coordinated by [[project engineering|project engineers]] and project managers &lt;ref&gt;Herbst, Andrew; Hans Verwijs (Oct. 19-22). "Project Engineering: Interdisciplinary Coordination and Overall Engineering Quality Control". Proc. of the Annual IAC conference of the American Society for Engineering Management 1 ({{ISBN|9781618393616}}): 15–21&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the size of the investment. A chemical engineer may do the job of project engineer full-time or part of the time, which requires additional training and job skills or act as a consultant to the project group. In the USA the education of chemical engineering graduates from the Baccalaureate programs accredited by [[ABET]] do not usually stress project engineering education, which can be obtained by specialized training, as electives, or from [[graduate programs]].  Project engineering jobs are some of the largest employers for chemical engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Do Chemical Engineers Do?|url=http://chemistry.about.com/od/chemistrystudentfaqs/f/chemeng.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process design and analysis===
{{main|Process design}}

A unit operation is a physical step in an individual chemical engineering process. Unit operations (such as [[crystallization]], [[filtration]], [[drying]] and [[evaporation]]) are used to prepare reactants, purifying and separating its products, recycling unspent reactants, and controlling energy transfer in reactors.{{sfn|McCabe|Smith|Hariott|1993|p=4}} On the other hand, a unit process is the chemical equivalent of a unit operation. Along with unit operations, unit processes constitute a process operation. Unit processes (such as [[nitration]] and [[oxidation]]) involve the conversion of material by [[biochemical]], [[thermochemical]] and other means. Chemical engineers responsible for these are called process engineers.{{sfn|Silla|2003|pp=8–9}}

Process design requires the definition of equipment types and sizes as well as how they are connected together and the materials of construction. Details are often printed on a [[Process Flow Diagram]] which is used to control the capacity and reliability of a new or modified chemical factory.

[[Education for Chemical Engineers|Education for chemical engineers]] in the first college degree 3 or 4 years of study stresses the principles and practices of process design. The same skills are used in existing chemical plants to evaluate the [[Economics#Economic efficiency|efficiency]] and make recommendations for improvements.

===Transport phenomena===
{{main|Transport phenomena}}

Modeling and analysis of transport phenomena is essential for many industrial applications. Transport phenomena involve [[fluid dynamics]], [[heat transfer]] and [[mass transfer]], which are governed mainly by [[momentum transfer]], [[energy transfer]] and transport of [[chemical species]] respectively. Models often involve separate considerations for  [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]], [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] and [[molecular]] level phenomena. Modeling of transport phenomena therefore requires an understanding of applied mathematics.{{sfn|Bird|Stewart|Lightfoot|2002|pp=1–2}}

==Applications and practice==
[[File:Chemengg.jpg|thumb|left|Chemical engineers use computers to control automated systems in plants.{{sfn|Garner|2003|pp=47–48}}|alt=Two computer flat screens showing a plant process management application]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1986-0205-015, Chemiekombinat Bitterfeld, Produktion von Weißtönern.jpg|right|thumb|Operators in a chemical plant using an older analog control board, seen in East-Germany, 1986.]]

[[Chemical engineer]]s "develop economic ways of using materials and energy".{{sfn|American Institute of Chemical Engineers|2003|loc=Article III}} Chemical engineers use [[chemistry]] and engineering to turn raw materials into usable products, such as medicine, petrochemicals and plastics on a large-scale, industrial setting. They are also involved in [[waste management]] and research. Both applied and research facets could make extensive use of computers.{{sfn|Garner|2003|pp=47–48}}

Chemical engineers may be involved in industry or university research where they are tasked with designing and performing experiments to create better and safer methods for production, pollution control, and resource conservation. They may be involved in designing and constructing plants as a [[project engineer]]. Chemical engineers serving as project engineers use their knowledge in selecting optimal production methods and plant equipment to minimize costs and maximize safety and profitability. After plant construction, chemical engineering project managers may be involved in equipment upgrades, process changes, troubleshooting, and daily operations in either full-time or consulting roles. {{sfn|Garner|2003|pp=49–50}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11332">'''Cheminformatics''' (also known as '''chemoinformatics''', '''chemioinformatics''' and '''chemical informatics''')  is the use of computer and [[Information science|informational]] techniques applied to a range of problems in the field of [[chemistry]]. These ''[[in silico]]'' techniques are used, for example, in [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]] and academic settings in the process of [[drug discovery]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Bharath|last2=Zhou|first2=Hongyi|last3=Kubanek|first3=Julia|last4=Skolnick|first4=Jeffrey|date=2014-04-26|title=Experimental validation of FINDSITEcomb virtual ligand screening results for eight proteins yields novel nanomolar and micromolar binders|journal=Journal of Cheminformatics|language=En|volume=6|issue=1|pages=16|doi=10.1186/1758-2946-6-16|issn=1758-2946|pmc=4038399|pmid=24936211}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These methods can also be used in chemical and allied industries in various other forms.

== History ==

The term chemoinformatics was defined by F.K. Brown&lt;ref name="Brown_1998"&gt;{{Cite book | author = F.K. Brown | title = Chapter 35. Chemoinformatics: What is it and How does it Impact Drug Discovery | journal = Annual Reports in Med. Chem. | year = 1998 | volume = 33 | pages = 375–384 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-7743(08)61100-8 | series = Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry | isbn = 978-0-12-040533-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brown, Frank | title = Editorial Opinion: Chemoinformatics – a ten year update | journal = [[Current Opinion in Drug Discovery &amp; Development]]| year = 2005 | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 296–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1998:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chemoinformatics is the mixing of those information resources to transform data into information and information into knowledge for the intended purpose of making better decisions faster in the area of drug lead identification and optimization.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since then, both spellings have been used, and some have evolved to be established as Cheminformatics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.molinspiration.com/chemoinformatics.html Cheminformatics or Chemoinformatics ?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; while European Academia settled in 2006 for Chemoinformatics.&lt;ref name="Obernai"&gt;[http://infochim.u-strasbg.fr/chemoinformatics/Obernai%20Declaration.pdf Obernai Declaration]&lt;/ref&gt; The recent establishment of the [[Journal of Cheminformatics]] is a strong push towards the shorter variant.

== Basics ==
Cheminformatics combines the scientific working fields of [[chemistry]], [[computer science]] and [[information science]] for example in the areas of [[topology (chemistry)|topology]], [[chemical graph theory]], [[information retrieval]] and [[data mining]] in the [[chemical space]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roy|first=Ambrish|last2=Srinivasan|first2=Bharath|last3=Skolnick|first3=Jeffrey|date=2015-08-12|title=PoLi: A Virtual Screening Pipeline Based on Template Pocket and Ligand Similarity|journal=Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling|language=EN|volume=55|issue=8|pages=1757–1770|doi=10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00232|issn=1549-9596|pmc=4593500|pmid=26225536}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Bharath|last2=Tonddast-Navaei‡|first2=Sam|last3=Roy§|first3=Ambrish|last4=Zhou|first4=Hongyi|last5=Skolnick|first5=Jeffrey|date=2018-09-07|title=Chemical space of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors: New approaches for discovering novel drugs for old bugs|journal=Medicinal Research Reviews|language=en|doi=10.1002/med.21538|pmid=30192413|issn=0198-6325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Bharath|last2=Tonddast-Navaei|first2=Sam|last3=Skolnick|first3=Jeffrey|date=September 2017|title=Pocket detection and interaction-weighted ligand-similarity search yields novel high-affinity binders for Myocilin-OLF, a protein implicated in glaucoma|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960894X1730731X|journal=Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters|volume=27|issue=17|pages=4133–4139|doi=10.1016/j.bmcl.2017.07.035|issn=0960-894X|pmc=5568477|pmid=28739043}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Bharath|last2=Zhou|first2=Hongyi|last3=Mitra|first3=Sreyoshi|last4=Skolnick|first4=Jeffrey|date=October 2016|title=Novel small molecule binders of human N-glycanase 1, a key player in the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation pathway|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0968089616306265|journal=Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry|volume=24|issue=19|pages=4750–4758|doi=10.1016/j.bmc.2016.08.019|issn=0968-0896|pmc=5015769|pmid=27567076}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gasteiger_2004"&gt;Gasteiger J.(Editor), Engel T.(Editor): ''Chemoinformatics : A Textbook''.

== Applications ==

===Storage and retrieval===
{{main|Chemical database}}
The primary application of cheminformatics is in the storage, indexing and search of information relating to compounds. The efficient search of such stored information includes topics that are dealt with in computer science as [[data mining]], [[information retrieval]], [[information extraction]] and [[machine learning]]. Related research topics include:
* [[Unstructured data]]
**[[Information retrieval]]
**[[Information extraction]]
* [[Structured data mining]] and mining of [[structured data]]
**[[Database mining]]
**[[Graph mining]]
**[[Molecule mining]]
**[[Sequence mining]]
**[[Tree mining]]
*[[Digital libraries]]

==== File formats ====
{{main|Chemical file format}}
The ''in silico'' representation of chemical structures uses specialized formats such as the [[XML]]-based [[Chemical Markup Language]] or [[Simplified molecular input line entry specification|SMILES]].  These representations are often used for storage in large [[chemical database]]s. While some formats are suited for visual representations in 2 or 3 dimensions, others are more suited for studying physical interactions, modeling and docking studies.

=== Virtual libraries ===
Chemical data can pertain to real or virtual molecules.  Virtual libraries of compounds
may be generated in various ways to explore chemical space and hypothesize novel 
compounds with desired properties.

Virtual libraries of classes of compounds (drugs, natural products, diversity-oriented synthetic products) were recently generated using the FOG (fragment optimized growth) algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FOG: Fragment Optimized Growth Algorithm for the de Novo Generation of Molecules occupying Druglike Chemical | last=Kutchukian | first=Peter  |author2=Lou, David |author3=Shakhnovich, Eugene  |journal=Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling | year=2009 |volume=49 | pages=1630–1642|doi=10.1021/ci9000458|pmid=19527020|issue=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was done by using cheminformatic tools to train transition probabilities of a [[Markov chain]] on authentic classes of compounds, and then using the Markov chain to generate novel compounds that were similar to the training database.

=== Virtual screening ===
{{main|Virtual screening}}
In contrast to [[high-throughput screening]], virtual screening involves computationally
screening ''[[in silico]]'' libraries of compounds, by means of various methods such as
[[docking (molecular)|docking]], to identify members likely to possess desired properties
such as biological activity against a given target&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. In some cases, [[combinatorial chemistry]] is used in the development of the library to increase the efficiency in mining the chemical space. More commonly, a diverse library of small molecules or [[natural product]]s is screened.

===Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)===
{{main|Quantitative structure–activity relationship}}
This is the calculation of [[quantitative structure–activity relationship]] and [[QSPR|quantitative structure property relationship]] values, used to predict the activity of compounds from their structures. In this context there is also a strong relationship to [[chemometrics]]. Chemical [[expert system]]s are also relevant, since they represent parts of chemical knowledge as an ''[[in silico]]'' representation. There is a relatively new concept of [[matched molecular pair analysis]] or prediction-driven MMPA which is coupled with QSAR model in order to identify activity cliff.&lt;ref name="Prediction-driven matched molecular pairs to interpret QSARs and aid the molecular optimization process"&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.jcheminf.com/content/6/1/48/abstract | doi=10.1186/s13321-014-0048-0| pmid=25544551| pmc=4272757| title=Prediction-driven matched molecular pairs to interpret QSARs and aid the molecular optimization process| journal=Journal of Cheminformatics| volume=6| issue=1| pages=48| year=2014| last1=Sushko| first1=Yurii| last2=Novotarskyi| first2=Sergii| last3=Körner| first3=Robert| last4=Vogt| first4=Joachim| last5=Abdelaziz| first5=Ahmed| last6=Tetko| first6=Igor V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christoph Sutter''' (born 20 March 1973)&lt;ref name="up.ethz.ch"/&gt; is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] carbon expert and [[entrepreneur]]. Christoph attended the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] where he studied for an MSc in Environmental Science (1993–1999) and a Master of Didactics on Environmental Science. He also concluded his PhD on the Topic "Sustainability Assessment of CDM Projects under the Kyoto Protocol" there. His thesis was awarded the ETH medal for the best PhD thesis in 2003.&lt;ref name="up.ethz.ch"/&gt; He completed his education with a McKinsey mini MBA in Toronto in Summer 2005.

After working for the consultancy Ernst Basler &amp; Partner in Zurich during his studies he was part of setting up the [[myclimate]] foundation based on his PhD results. Myclimate is an offset provider for the voluntary offsetting market, focused on [[CDM Gold Standard]] Certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nachhaltigkeit.org/200911113422/mensch-gesellschaft/interviews/klimamarkt-braucht-klare-signale |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214170120/http://www.nachhaltigkeit.org/200911113422/mensch-gesellschaft/interviews/klimamarkt-braucht-klare-signale |archivedate=2011-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this activity, Christoph was called to work for the [[UNFCCC]] Methodology Panel in 2005 where he worked for 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nzz.ch/vermittler_zwischen_umwelt_und_wirtschaft-1.812553|title=Vermittler zwischen Umwelt und Wirtschaft - NZZ|date=21 August 2008|publisher=|via=NZZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unsatisfied with the exclusive focus on voluntary offsetting, he later founded the company [http://www.southpolecarbon.com] [[South Pole Carbon]] with his former colleagues Thomas Camerata and [[Renat Heuberger]].

A '''community land trust''' ('''CLT''') is a nonprofit corporation that develops and stewards affordable housing, community gardens, civic buildings, commercial spaces and other community assets on behalf of a community. “CLTs” balance the needs of individuals to access land and maintain security of tenure with a community’s need to maintain affordability, economic diversity and local access to essential services.

== Historical overview ==
The community land trust (CLT) is a neutral and sustainable model of affordable housing and community development that has slowly spread throughout the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom over the past 40 years. The model was originated in the United States by [[Ralph Borsodi]] and [[Robert Swann (land trust pioneer)|Robert Swann]], drawing upon earlier examples of planned communities on leased land including the [[Garden city movement]] in the United Kingdom, single tax communities in the US, [[Gramdan]] villages in India, and [[moshav]] communities on lands owned by the [[Jewish National Fund]] in Israel. [[New Communities]], Inc., the prototype for the modern-day community land trust, was formed in 1969 near [[Albany, Georgia]], by leaders of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] who were seeking a new way to achieve secure access to land for [[African American farmer]]s.

== History ==
According to the [[Schumacher Center for a New Economics]] website, "Swann was inspired by [[Ralph Borsodi]] and by Borsodi's work with [[J. P. Narayan]] and [[Vinoba Bhave]], both disciples of [[Gandhi]]. Vinoba walked from village to village in rural [[India]] in the 1950s and 1960s, gathering people together and asking those with more land than they needed to give a portion of it to their poorer sisters and brothers. The initiative was known as the [[Bhoodan]] or Land gift movement, and many of India's leaders participated in these walks.

Some of the new landowners, however, became discouraged. Without tools to work the land and seeds to plant it, without an affordable [[Credit (finance)|credit system]] available to purchase these necessary things, the land was useless to them. They soon sold their deeds back to the large landowners and left for the cities. Seeing this, Vinoba altered the Boodan system to a [[Gramdan]] or Village gift system. All donated land was subsequently held by the village itself. The village would then lease the land to those capable of working it. The lease expired if the land was unused. The Gramdan movement inspired a series of regional village land trusts that anticipated Community Land Trusts in the United States.

The first organization to be labeled with the term 'community land trust' in the U.S., called [[New Communities]], Inc., was founded with the purpose of helping [[African-American]] farmers in the rural South to gain access to farmland and to work it with security.

A precursor to this was the [[Celo Community]] in North Carolina, which was founded in 1937 by [[Arthur Ernest Morgan]].&lt;ref name=hicks&gt;Hicks, George L. Experimental Americans: Celo and Utopian Community in the Twentieth Century. University of Illinois Press: 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Communities ===
{{Main|New Communities}}

Robert Swann worked with [[Slater King]], president of the [[Albany Movement]] and a cousin of [[Martin Luther King]], Jr., [[Charles Sherrod]], an organizer for the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], his wife [[Shirley Sherrod]], and individuals from other southern civil rights organizations in the South to develop [[New Communities]], Inc., "a nonprofit organization to hold land in perpetual trust for the permanent use of rural communities".

Their vision for New Communities Inc. drew heavily on the example and experience of the [[Jewish National Fund]] (JNF) in making land available through 99-year ground leases for the development of planned communities and agricultural cooperatives.  The JNF was founded in 1901 to buy and develop land in [[Ottoman Palestine]] (later Israel) for Jewish settlement.  By 2007, the JNF owned 13% of all the land in Israel.  It has a long and established legal history of leasing land to individuals, to [[cooperative]]s, and to [[intentional communities]] such as [[kibbutz]]im and [[moshav]]im. Swann, Slater King, Charles Sherrod, Faye Bennett, director of the National Sharecroppers Fund, and four other Southerners travelled to Israel in 1968 to learn more about ground leasing. They decided on a model that included individual leaseholds for [[homestead (buildings)|homesteads]] and [[cooperative]] leases for farmland. New Communities Inc. purchased a {{convert|5000|acre|km2|sing=on}} farm near [[Albany, Georgia]] in 1970, developed a plan for the land, and farmed it for 20 years. The land was eventually lost as a result of [[Pigford v. Glickman|USDA]] racial discrimination, but the example of New Communities inspired the formation of a dozen other rural community land trusts in the 1970s. It also inspired and informed the first book about community land trusts, produced by the International Independence Institute in 1972.

Ralph Borsodi, Robert Swann, and Erick Hansch founded the International Independence Institute in 1967 to provide training and technical assistance for rural development in the United States and other countries, drawing on the model of the Gramdan villages being developed in India. In 1972, Swann, Hansch, Shimon Gottschalk, and Ted Webster proposed a "new model for land tenure in America" in ''The Community Land Trust'', the first book to name and describe this new approach to the ownership of land, housing, and other buildings. One year later, they changed the name of the International Independence Institute to the Institute for Community Economics (ICE).

In the 1980s, ICE began popularizing a new notion of the CLT, applying the model for the first time to problems of affordable housing, gentrification, displacement, and neighborhood revitalization in urban areas. From 1980–1990, [[Chuck Matthei]], an activist with roots in the [[Catholic Worker movement]] and the [[peace movement]], served as Executive Director of ICE, then based in [[Greenfield, Massachusetts|Greenfield]], MA and now an affiliate of the National Housing Trust and located in [[Washington, DC]]. ICE pioneered the modern community land trust and community loan fund models. During Matthei's tenure, the number of community land trusts increased from a dozen to more than 100 groups in 23 states, creating many hundreds of permanently affordable housing units, as well as commercial and public service facilities. With colleagues Matthei guided the development of 25 regional loan funds and organized the National Association of Community Development Loan Funds, later known as the National Community Capital Association. From 1985–1990, Matthei served as a founding Chairman of the Association and from 1983–1988 he served as a founding board member of the [http://www.socialinvest.org/ Social Investment Forum], the national professional association in the field of socially responsible investment. Matthei also launched an effort in the early to mid-1980s to address many of the legal and operational questions about CLTs that were arising as banks, public officials and1 by an ecumenical association of churches and ministries created to prevent the displacement of low-income, African-American residents from their neighborhood. During the 1980s, the number of urban CLTs increased dramatically. They were sometimes formed, as in Cincinnati, in opposition to the plans and politics of municipal government. In other cities, like Burlington, Vermont and Syracuse, New York, community land trusts were formed in partnership with a local government. One of the most significant city-CLT partnerships was formed in 1989 when a CLT subsidiary of the Dudley Neighborhood Initiative was granted the power of eminent domain by the City of Boston. others encountered the growing effort to create such community-based organizations around the country.

The first urban CLT, the Community Land Cooperative of Cincinnati, was founded in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Land Cooperative of Cincinnati (CLCC) |url=https://community-wealth.org/content/community-land-cooperative-cincinnati-clcc|access-date=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently over 250 community land trusts in the United States. In 2006, a national association was established in the United States to provide assistance and support for CLTs: the National Community Land Trust Network. Also established that year to serve as the Network’s training and research arm was the National CLT Academy. Fledgling CLT movements are also underway in England, Canada, Australia, Belgium, Kenya and [https://web.archive.org/web/20111127232235/http://www.communitylandtrusts.co.nz/ New Zealand]. Similar nationwide networks for promoting and supporting CLTs have recently been formed in the United Kingdom and in Australia.

[[File:Community Land Trusts.png|thumbnail|right|The basic mechanisms of community land trusts]]

== Defining features in the United States ==
Since 1992, the defining features of the CLT model in the United States have been enshrined in federal law ([[s:Housing and Community Development Act of 1992/Title II#Sec. 213. Housing Education and Organizational Support for Community Land Trusts.|Section 213, Housing and Community Development Act of 1992]]). There is considerable variation among the hundreds of organizations that call themselves a community land trust, but ten key features are to be found in most of them.

=== Nonprofit, tax-exempt corporation ===
A community land trust is an independent, nonprofit corporation that is legally chartered in the state in which it is located. Most CLTs are started from scratch, but some are grafted onto existing nonprofit corporations such as community development corporations. Most CLTs target their activities and resources toward charitable activities like providing housing for low-income people and redeveloping blighted neighborhoods, making them eligible to receive [[501(c)(3)]] designation from the IRS.

=== Dual ownership ===
A nonprofit corporation, the CLT, acquires multiple parcels of land throughout a targeted geographic area with the intention of retaining ownership of the parcels forever. Any building already located on the land or later constructed on the land can be held by the CLT or sold off to an individual homeowner, a [[Housing cooperative|cooperative housing corporation]], a nonprofit developer of rental housing, or some other nonprofit, governmental, or for-profit entity.&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;{{cite news|title= Affordable Housing, Always|first= Alana |last= Semuels|work= [[The Atlantic]]|date= July 7, 2015| url= http://www.routefifty.com/2015/07/collective-land-ownership-cities/117061/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leased land ===
Although CLTs intend never to resell their land, they can provide for the exclusive use of their land by the owners of any buildings located thereon. Exclusive use of parcels of land can be conveyed to individual homeowners or to the owners of other types of residential or commercial structures by long-term ground leases. The two-party contract between the landowner (the CLT) and a building's owner protects the owner's interests in security, privacy, legacy, and equity and enforces the CLT's interests in preserving the appropriate use, the structural integrity and the continuing affordability of any buildings on its land.

=== Perpetual affordability ===
The CLT retains an option to repurchase any residential (or commercial) structures on its land if their owners ever choose to sell. The resale price is set by a formula contained in the ground lease that is designed to give present homeowners a fair return on their investment but giving future homebuyers fair access to housing at an affordable price. By design and by intent, the CLT is committed to preserving the affordability of housing (and other structures), one owner after another, one generation after another, in perpetuity.

=== Perpetual responsibility ===
The CLT does not disappear once a building is sold. As owner of the underlying land and as owner of an option to repurchase any buildings located on its land, the CLT has an abiding interest in what happens to the structures and to the people who occupy them. The ground lease requires owner-occupancy and responsible use of the premises. Should buildings become a hazard, the ground lease gives the CLT the right to step in and force repairs. Should property owners default on their mortgages, the ground lease gives the CLT the right to step in and cure the default, forestalling foreclosure. The CLT remains a party to the deal, safeguarding the structural integrity of the buildings and the residential security of the occupants.

=== Community base ===
The CLT operates within the physical boundaries of a targeted locality. It is guided by and accountable to the people who call the locale their home. Most commonly, any adult who resides on the CLT’s land and any adult who resides within the area deemed by the CLT to be its community can become a voting member of the CLT. The community may encompass a single neighborhood, multiple neighborhoods, or, in some cases, an entire town, city, or county.

=== Governance ===
Typically, CLTs are run by a [[board of directors]] whose members include three groups of [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s: residents or leaseholders, people who reside within its targeted community but do not live on its land, and lastly the broader public interest. This third group is frequently represented by government officials, funders, housing agencies, and social service providers. Organization [[bylaws]] may designate each of these groups a specific and equal number of seats, and they may be elected separately by their constituent groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.resilience.org/stories/2017-03-29/community-land-trust-models-housing-coops-around-world/ |quote=Like many other CLTs, the CHT has a governing board divided in thirds and elected by residents: one-third of its membership is constituted by CHT residents; another third from surrounding communities; and the final third is {{sic|comprised |hide=y}} of municipal officials and a regional representative who are presumed to speak for the public interest (in other CLTs this final third is often {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} technical specialists like engineers, accountants, planners, architects, social workers or lawyers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rioonwatch.org/?p=25330 |quote=CLT trusts are usually divided into thirds, where one third of the trust leadership is residents from the CLT community, one third is people from the neighborhood surrounding the CLT, and one third is made up of technical experts and municipal officials who provide particular expertise (legal, architectural, engineering, political, etc.) and speak in the general public interest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.prosper.org.au/2008/05/29/community-land-trusts-explained/ |quote=those representing resident members, those representing members who are not CLT residents, and those representing the broader community interest here members includes neighbors who are interested, supportive, or may become residents}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cltnetwork.org/faq/ |quote=CLTs are nonprofit organizations—governed by a board of CLT residents, community residents and public representatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saratogacommunityhousing.org/what-is-a-community-land-trust/ |quote=residents of trust owned lands, other community members and public-interest representatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Control of the CLT’s board is diffused and balanced to ensure that all interests are heard but that no interest predominates.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

=== Expansionist acquisition ===
CLTs are not focused on a single project located on a single parcel of land. They are committed to an active acquisition and development program aimed at expanding the CLT's holdings of land and increasing the supply of affordable housing (and other types of buildings) under the CLT's stewardship. A CLT's holdings are seldom concentrated in one corner of a community but tend to be scattered throughout its service area, indistinguishable from other owner-occupied housing in the same neighborhood.

== Flexible development ==
There is enormous variability in the types of projects that CLTs pursue and in the roles they play in developing them. Many CLTs do development with their own staff. Others delegate development to nonprofit or for-profit partners, confining their own efforts to assembling land and preserving the affordability of any structures located upon it. Some CLTs focus on a single type and tenure of housing, like detached, owner-occupied houses. Others take full advantage of the model’s unique flexibility. They develop housing of many types and tenures or they focus more broadly on comprehensive community development, undertaking a diverse array of residential and commercial projects. CLTs around the country have constructed (or acquired, rehabilitated, and resold) single-family homes, duplexes, condos, co-ops, SROs, multi-unit apartment buildings, and mobile home parks. CLTs have created facilities for neighborhood businesses, nonprofit organizations, and social service agencies. CLTs have provided sites for community gardens. vest-pocket parks, and affordable working land for entry-level agriculturalists. Permanently affordable access to land is the common ingredient, linking them all. The CLT is the social thread, connecting them all.

== Development elsewhere ==
Fledgling CLT movements are also underway in:

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7790">'''Cue validity''' is the [[conditional probability]] that an object falls in a particular category given a particular feature or ''cue''. The term was popularized by {{Harvtxt|Beach|1964}}, {{Harvtxt|Reed|1972}} and especially by [[Eleanor Rosch]] in her investigations of the acquisition of so-called [[Prototype_theory#Basic_level_categories | ''basic categories'']] ({{Harvnb|Rosch|Mervis|1975}};{{Harvnb|Rosch|1978}}). 

==Definition of cue validity==
Formally, the cue validity of a feature &lt;math&gt;f_i\ &lt;/math&gt; with respect to category &lt;math&gt;c_j\ &lt;/math&gt; has been defined in the following ways:
* As the conditional probability &lt;math&gt;p(c_j|f_i)\ &lt;/math&gt;; see {{Harvtxt|Reed|1972}}, {{Harvtxt|Rosch|Mervis|1975}}, {{Harvtxt|Rosch|1978}}.
* As the deviation of the conditional probability from the category base rate, &lt;math&gt;p(c_j|f_i)-p(c_j)\ &lt;/math&gt;; see {{Harvtxt|Edgell|1993}}, {{Harvtxt|Kruschke|Johansen|1999}}.
* As a function of the linear correlation; see {{Harvtxt|Smedslund|1955}}, {{Harvtxt|Castellan|1973}}, {{Harvtxt|Sawyer|1991}}, {{Harvtxt|Busemeyer|Myung|McDaniel|1993}}.
* Other definitions; see {{Harvtxt|Restle|1957}}, {{Harvtxt|Martignon|Vitouch|Takezawa|Forster|2003}}.

For the definitions based on probability, a high cue validity for a given feature means that the feature or attribute is more diagnostic of the class membership than a feature with low cue validity. Thus, a high-cue validity feature is one which conveys more information about the category or class variable, and may thus be considered as more useful for identifying objects as belonging to that category. Thus, high cue validity expresses high feature ''informativeness''. For the definitions based on linear correlation, the expression of "informativeness" captured by the cue validity measure is not the full expression of the feature's informativeness (as in [[mutual information]], for example), but only that portion of its informativeness that is expressed in a linear relationship. For some purposes, a bilateral measure such as the [[mutual information]] or [[category utility]] is more appropriate than the cue validity.

==Examples==
As an example, let us consider the domain of "numbers" and allow that every number has an attribute (i.e., a ''cue'') named "&lt;code&gt;is_positive_integer&lt;/code&gt;", which we call &lt;math&gt;f_{p\mbox{-}int}\ &lt;/math&gt;, and which adopts the value 1 if the number is actually a positive [[integer]]. Then we can inquire what the validity of this cue is with regard to the following classes: {&lt;code&gt;rational number&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;irrational number&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;even integer&lt;/code&gt;}:
* If we know that a number is a positive integer we know that it is a [[rational number]]. Thus, &lt;math&gt;p(c_{rational}|f_{p\mbox{-}int}) = 1\ &lt;/math&gt;, the cue validity for &lt;code&gt;is_positive_integer&lt;/code&gt; as a cue for the category &lt;code&gt;rational number&lt;/code&gt; is 1.
* If we know that a number is a positive integer then we know that it is ''not'' an [[irrational number]]. Thus, &lt;math&gt;p(c_{irrational}|f_{p\mbox{-}int}) = 0\ &lt;/math&gt;, the cue validity for &lt;code&gt;is_positive_integer&lt;/code&gt; as a cue for the category &lt;code&gt;irrational number&lt;/code&gt; is 0.
* If we know only that a number is a positive integer, then its chances of being even or odd are 50-50 (there being the same number of even and odd integers). Thus, &lt;math&gt;p(c_{even}|f_{p\mbox{-}int}) = 0.5\ &lt;/math&gt;, the cue validity for &lt;code&gt;is_positive_integer&lt;/code&gt; as a cue for the category &lt;code&gt;even integer&lt;/code&gt; is 0.5, meaning that the attribute &lt;code&gt;is_positive_integer&lt;/code&gt; is entirely uninformative about the number's membership in the class &lt;code&gt;even integer&lt;/code&gt;.

In [[perception]], "cue validity" is often short for ''[[ecological validity (perception)|ecological validity]]'' of a perceptual cue, and is defined as a correlation rather than a probability (see above). In this definition, an uninformative perceptual cue has an ecological validity of 0 rather than 0.5.

==Use of the cue validity==
In much of the work on modeling human category learning, there has been the assumption made (and sometimes validated) that attentional weighting tracks the cue validity, or tracks some related measure of feature informativeness. This would imply that attributes are differently weighted by the perceptual system; informative or high-cue validity attributes being weighted more heavily, while uninformative or low-cue validity attributes are weighted more lightly or ignored altogether (see, e.g., Navarro 1998).

[[Image:Double Dildo.jpg|right|thumb|An 18-inch latex double dildo]]

A '''double penetration [[dildo]]''' or '''double dildo''' is a [[sex toy]] that allows for the simultaneous penetration of two bodily orifices at the same time. It is designed in the form of two penetrative stimulators ([[penis]] shaped or non-[[phallic]]) that come separately or fixed on the single shaft. Some of them include a vibrating motor that turns them into [[List of sex positions#Multiple penetration|double penetration]] [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrators]].

==Use==
The following three sexual configurations can be performed with using double penetration dildos.
*'''Vagina-to-vagina'''. Some women use double-ended dildos as part of their sex play with a second woman. The double-ended nature of the dildo allows penetration in two [[vagina]]s simultaneously.
*'''Vagina-to-anus'''. The majority of double-penetration dildos are designed for simultaneous stimulation of [[anus|anal]] and vaginal [[erogenous zones]], but in the case of elongated "double-headed" devices it is possible for two partners to use the same device simultaneously. This can even be used for [[pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]], when a woman penetrates the anus of a man.
*'''Anus-to-anus'''. Most double-ended dildos can be used for [[anal sex|anal penetration]] of both partners.

Simulated [[oral sex]] can also be performed on the dildo.

==Classification==
[[Image:Double dildo overview 01.jpg|thumb|right|Double dildo with remote-controlled rotating vibrator on one side]]

* '''Double-ended dildo''' aka  ''DED''.  Associated with [[lesbian]] love making devices, double-ended dildos are also used by [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] women for anal and vaginal simultaneous penetration. This dildo is usually made out of the soft flexible material (such as plastic or some form of rubber) that allows changing the shape of the shaft like the user wishes: to bend in the C-shape or to straighten it. In the past, though, they were often made of wood: Haberlandt (1899), for example, illustrates a straight double-ended dildo of this kind from late 19th century [[Zanzibar]].
* '''Anal and vaginal stimulators on the single shaft'''. These types of dildos or vibrators are intended for stimulating the user anally and vaginally. One shaft of the smaller length and width is attached to the other one that are both inserted stimulating anal and vaginal erogenous zones in a woman. In a vibrating sex toy there can be two motors in both shafts controlled together or separately.
* '''Kits of two separate vibrators or dildos used simultaneously'''. This type is a kit of vibrators and dildos that are not connected with each other or connected by a wire attached to the single control panel. They are used simultaneously or separately stimulating the erogenous zones of both partners. This type is more mobile and one can offer much more possibilities for love plays with or without partner(s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/news/a17085/dildo-christmas-tree/?src=spr_TWITTER&amp;spr_id=1440_35414494 Christmas Tree Decorated With Sex Toys In Milan]&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bondagebunnies.co.uk/ |title= Penis Dildos|accessdate=March 24, 2016 | archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6gFLHugbY6g61OVjAU |archivedate=March 24, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=News &amp; Commentary|work=Valley Advocate|location=Easthampton, Massachusetts|publisher=Accessed via [[NewsBank]]|date=4 November 2010|quote=The Hitachi Magic Wand , with a reputation for releasing even the most stubborn orgasm, brings a powerful buzz to all the right places (instead of uncomfortably rattling the handle). Separately sold removable silicone tops add extra texture or penetration options}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Double-ended/sided hands and strap free dildos'''. The latest technological achievement is totally new kind of strapless strap on. A special example of these are [[Feeldoe]], Sysil, Super Strapless Silicone Dildo, Share, Nexus Maximus and Transfer, which has an egg shaped bulb designed to be inserted into the vagina or anus of the wearer.

==Materials==
* Jelly rubber ("jelly"). The most popular sex toy material that is convenient for designing any shape and texture of the shaft. It features a variety of colors, though jelly tends to suffer discoloration, and physical deterioration over time. This material contains chemicals called [[phthalate]]s, which are thought to be harmful to gynecological and reproductive health. Unlike silicone (below) this material is porous, meaning that it can harbor bacteria.
* [[Silicone]]. Dildos and vibrators made of this material are durable and feature excellent non-porous properties, so they are easy to clean and maintain.
* [[Rubber]]. Many realistic dildos are made of rubber—a material that is both pliable and flexible enough for effective penetration. Like jelly, rubber is also porous.
* [[Glass]]. Glass double-ended dildos are usually created with special original designs. Glass is a smooth and firm material that delivers a cool feeling when used. It can also be used chilled and warmed for different feeling. Usually, glass dildos are made out of a special [[Borosilicate glass|borosilicate]] type of glass, of which [[Pyrex]], Schott-Duranglas and Simax are the most suited.
* [[Plastic]]. This non-porous and phthalate-free material is often used for creating double-ended dildos.

'''Drapery''' is a general word referring to [[cloth]]s or [[textile]]s ([[Old French]] ''[[wikt:draperie|draperie]]'', from [[Late Latin]] ''drappus''&lt;ref&gt;"Perhaps of [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] origin" ''[[OED]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;).  It may refer to cloth used for decorative purposes &amp;ndash; such as around windows &amp;ndash; or to the trade of retailing cloth, originally mostly for clothing, formerly conducted by drapers. 

In [[art history]], drapery refers to any cloth or textile depicted, which is usually clothing. The schematic depiction of the folds and woven patterns of loose-hanging clothing on the human form, with ancient prototypes, was reimagined as an adjunct to the female form by Greek vase-painters and sculptors of the earliest fifth century and has remained a major source of stylistic formulas in sculpture and painting, even after the [[Renaissance]] adoption of tighter-fitting clothing styles.  After the Renaissance, large cloths with no very obvious purpose are often used decoratively, especially in portraits in the [[grand manner]]; these are also known as draperies.
[[Image:Fresque Mithraeum Marino.jpg|thumb|280px|Fresco of [[Mithras]] and the Bull from the [[mithraeum]] at Marino, (3rd century CE)]]
For the Greeks, as [[Sir Kenneth Clark]] noted,&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''The Young Johneey: A Study in Ideal Form'' 1956:245ff.&lt;/ref&gt; clinging drapery followed the planes and contours of the bodily form, emphasizing its twist and stretch: "floating drapery makes visible the line of movement through which it has just passed.... Drapery, by suggesting lines of force, indicates for each action a past and a possible future." Clark contrasted the formalized draperies in the frieze at Olympia with the sculptural frieze figures of the [[Parthenon]], where "it has attained a freedom and an expressive power that have never been equalled except by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]". Undraped male figures, Clark observed, "were kept in motion by their flying cloaks."

The '''Earthquake Engineering Research Institute''' ('''EERI''') is a leading technical society in dissemination of earthquake risk and [[earthquake engineering]] research both in the U.S. and globally.  EERI members include researchers, geologists, geotechnical engineers, educators, government officials, and building code regulators.  Their mission, as stated in their 5-year plan published in 2006, has three points: "Advancing the science and practice of earthquake engineering; Improving understanding of the impact of earthquakes on the physical, social, economic, political, and cultural environment; and Advocating comprehensive and realistic measures for reducing the harmful effects of earthquakes".&lt;ref name= "plan"&gt;[http://www.eeri.org/site/images/about/strategic_plan.pdf EERI, ''Earthquake Engineering Research Institute Strategic Plan 2006-2010'', 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
In the 2006 5-year plan, the EERI has identified four main goals towards fulfilling their mission and planned strategies to carry them out.&lt;ref name = "plan" /&gt;

#"'''Enhance and expand educational materials and technical programs.'''"  They will hold two seminars per year on topics intended to interest a wide audience.  They will also post many of their publications online, such as their journal ''Earthquake Spectra''.  
# "'''Outreach and Advocacy'''"  They will continue to release their findings on earthquake risks, including the costs of potential disasters.  They hope to influence policymakers to increase funds for preventing these risks.  They hope also to include earthquake safety into the "green" building design movement.
#"'''Maintain a strong program of international activities.'''"  They serve as an inflow point in the U.S. for earthquake research from other countries.  They also serve as an outflow, translating their research into languages other than English.
#"'''Expand and broaden financial resource base.'''"  They wish to raise $1 million in donations by 2010, and increase worldwide membership to 3,000.  They wish to expand their programs and partnerships with other organizations with more workshops and seminars.  In February, 2010, the EERI entered a partnership with the Geo-Institute of [[American Society of Civil Engineers]], increasing their collaboration to reduce earthquake hazards.&lt;ref name = "team"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeri.org/site/images/about/G-I-Agreement-signed.pdf|title=Geo-Institute of ASCE and Earthquake Engineering Research Institute Partnering Agreement, 2010.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The EERI was formed in 1948 as an advising committee on the [[U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]].   It quickly became its own independent, [[nonprofit organization]], with the purpose of studying why buildings fail under earthquake disasters, and what methods can prevent these failures.    At first they conducted their research in laboratories of different University or Government groups.  As the EERI grew, they began to more often send research funds to the Universities, and have the University conduct the research.  EERI focused more on identifying and investigating areas in need of research, and policymaking based on the university’s lab results.

In 1952 the EERI organized the first Conference on Earthquake Engineering, at [[UCLA]].  In 1955, they held the first World Conference on Earthquake Engineering.    In 1984, the 8th World Conference was held in [[San Francisco]].  This conference brought in scientists from 54 countries.

At first, membership to the EERI was limited to invite-only engineers and scientists.   
In 1973, they began to hire members by application, and increased their membership from 126 to 721 by 1978.  In 1991, EERI began receiving funding from the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), to continue publishing information on how to reduce damage from earthquakes.

After a number of location changes, the EERI headquarters settled in [[Oakland]], [[California]].

Their quarterly journal, ''Earthquake Spectra'', covers current research on earthquake engineering and is available online or by subscription.   Its target audience is any geologist, seismologist, or related engineer.  EERI also publishes many other types of information, including a monthly newsletter, an oral history series, and field investigation reports.&lt;ref name = "history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/nicee/wcee/article/14_S07-005.PDF|author=Tubbesing, Susan K., and Thalia Anagnos|title=The Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, a Short History of the U.S. National Earthquake Engineering Society|publisher=Earthquake Engineering Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==California earthquake assessments==
EERI performs risk assessments on earthquake potential sites around the world.  This is a quick summary of two reports on California cities.

In 2006 an engineering firm related to the EERI has projected over $122 billion in damages, if a repeat of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] occurs.  This number includes damages to homes and structures, excluding fire damage.&lt;ref name = "sanfran"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11947095/ns/us_news-san_francisco_earthquake_1906/ Johnson, Alex. ''"Bay Area far from ready for the next ‘Big One’."'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The EERI lobbies for government funding to prevent natural disasters.  The money is best spent before loss of life and large-scale structural damage, though often it is not seen until afterward, as evidenced by Hurricane Katrina.  The EERI and the [[USGS]] have identified that a potential large earthquake in [[Los Angeles]] would cause more damage than Katrina at New Orleans, with up to $250 billion in total damages and 18,000 deaths.&lt;ref name = "katrina"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9351829/ns/technology_and_science-science/|title=Major quake could be worse than Katrina|date=15 September 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student involvement==
EERI has a student chapter in 29 colleges across the U.S. to further promote interest in [[earthquake engineering]].A few representatives from each chapter make up the Student Leadership Council (SLC).&lt;ref name = "history" /&gt;  Since 2008 the EERI and SLC have held the Undergraduate Seismic Design Competition, which was previously run by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER).  In this competition a team of undergraduate college students must design and construct a structure made of [[balsa wood]].  The structure is limited by many rules, such as a weight limit, the individual heights of each floor, total height limit, and more.  The structure is subjected to extra weight and placed on a shake table, which moves to simulate an earthquake.  An [[accelerometer]] is placed on top of the building to measure how fast the top of the building shakes.  Students’ structures are judged on a number of criteria, including the height of the structure, number of floors, the accelerometer readings, and whether the structure breaks.  Students will want to make a building close to the height limit because the higher floors are worth more points. The 8th annual competition is to be held in Portland, OR, March 7th through 10th, along with the 63rd EERI annual meeting.&lt;ref name = "compete"&gt;[https://slc.eeri.org/SDC2017BeforeTheCompetition.htm EERI Seismic Design Competition, ''2017 Undergraduate Seismic Design Competition Announcements'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5412">[[Image:Energese.jpg|thumb|140px|right| The Energy Systems Language of Systems Ecology]]

The '''Energy Systems Language''', also referred to as '''Energese''', '''Energy Circuit Language''', or '''Generic Systems Symbols''', was developed by the [[ecologist]] [[Howard T. Odum]] and colleagues in the 1950s during studies of the tropical forests funded by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]]. They are used to compose energy flow diagrams in the field of [[systems ecology]].

==Design intent==
The design intent of the energy systems language was to facilitate the generic depiction of energy flows through any scale system while encompassing the [[laws of physics]], and in particular, the laws of [[thermodynamics]] (see [[energy transformation]] for an example).

In particular H.T. Odum aimed to produce a language which could facilitate the intellectual analysis, engineering synthesis and management of global systems such as the geobiosphere, and its many subsystems. Within this aim, H.T. Odum had a strong concern that many abstract mathematical models of such systems were not thermodynamically valid. Hence he used analog computers to make system models due to their [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]; that is, the electronic circuits are of value for modelling natural systems which are assumed to obey the laws of energy flow, because, in themselves the circuits, like natural systems, also obey the known laws of energy flow, where the [[energy forms|energy form]] is electrical. However Odum was interested not only in the electronic circuits themselves, but also in how they might be used as formal analogies for modeling other systems which also had energy flowing through them. As a result, Odum did not restrict his inquiry to the analysis and synthesis of any one system in isolation. The discipline that is most often associated with this kind of approach, together with the use of the energy systems language is known as [[systems ecology]].

==General characteristics==
[[Image:PassiveAnalog.jpg|thumb|220px|left| Passive electrical equivalent of Energy Systems Language storage icon]]
When applying the electronic circuits (and schematics) to modeling ecological and economic systems, Odum believed that generic categories, or characteristic modules, could be derived. Moreover he felt that a general symbolic system, fully defined in electronic terms (including the mathematics thereof) would be useful for depicting real system characteristics, such as the general categories of production, storage, flow, transformation, and consumption. Central principles of electronics also therefore became central features of the energy systems language – Odum's generic symbolism.

Depicted to the left is what the generic symbol for storage, which Odum named the Bertalanffy module, in honor of the [[General systems theory|general systems]] theorist [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]].

For Odum, in order to achieve a [[holistic]] understanding of how many apparently different systems actually affect each other, it was important to have a generic language with a massively scalable modeling capacity – to model global-to-local, ecological, physical and economic systems. The intention was, and for those who still apply it, is, to make biological, physical, ecological, economic and other system models thermodynamically, and so also [[energetics|energetically]], valid and [[Verification and validation|verifiable]]. As a consequence the designers of the language also aimed to include the energy metabolism of any system within the scope of inquiry.

==Pictographic icons==
In order to aid learning, in ''Modeling for all Scales'' Odum and Odum (2000) suggested systems might first be introduced with pictographic icons, and then later defined in the generic symbolism.  [[Pictograms]] have therefore been used in software programs like ExtendSim to depict the basic categories of the  Energy Systems Language. Some have argued that such an approach shares similar motivations to [[Otto Neurath]]'s [[Isotype (pictograms)|isotype]] project, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s ([[Characteristica Universalis]]) [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] Project and [[Buckminster Fuller]]'s works.

This form of relativism has its own particular problem, regardless of whether one is talking about truth being relative to the individual, the position or purpose of the individual, or the conceptual scheme within which the truth was revealed.

One school of thought compares scientific knowledge to the mythology of other cultures, arguing that it is merely our society's set of myths based on societal assumptions. For support, [[Paul Feyerabend]]'s comments in ''[[Against Method]]'' that "The similarities between science and myth are indeed astonishing" and "First-world science is one science among many" (from the introduction to the Chinese edition)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feyerabend|first=Paul|title=Against method|date=1992|publisher=Verso|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780860916468|page=3|edition=Repr}}&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes cited, although it is not clear if Feyerabend meant them to be taken entirely seriously.

Yves Winkin, a Belgian professor of communications, responded to a popular trial in which two witnesses gave contradicting testimony by telling the newspaper ''Le Soir'' that "There is no transcendent truth.

== Criticism ==
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
Cognitive relativism is unfalsifiable and has been criticized by both [[Analytic Philosophy|analytic philosophers]] and [[Science|scientists]].

Cosmologist [[Stephen Hawking]] in ''[[The Grand Design (book)|The Grand Design]]'' has advocated [[model-dependent realism]], which bears close resemblance to a relativist position, as a means of reconciling apparent inconsistencies between different iterations of [[M-Theory]].

[[Larry Laudan]]'s book ''Science and Relativism''&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Relativism: Dialogues on the Philosophy of Science'', {{ISBN|978-0-226-46949-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlines the various philosophical points of view on the subject in the form of a dialogue.

'''Frame-based terminology''' is a [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive]] approach to [[terminology]] developed by [[Pamela Faber]] and colleagues at the [[University of Granada]]. One of its basic premises is that the [[conceptualization]] of any specialized domain is goal-oriented, and depends to a certain degree on the task to be accomplished. Since a major problem in modeling any domain is the fact that languages can reflect different conceptualizations and construals, texts as well as specialized knowledge resources are used to extract a set of domain concepts. Language structure is also analyzed to obtain an inventory of conceptual relations to structure these concepts.

As its name implies, frame-based terminology uses certain aspects of [[Frame semantics (linguistics)|frame semantics]] to structure specialized domains and create non-language-specific representations. Such configurations are the conceptual meaning underlying specialized texts in different languages, and thus facilitate specialized knowledge acquisition.

Frame-based terminology focuses on:
# conceptual organization;
# the multidimensional nature of terminological units; and
# the extraction of semantic and syntactic information through the use of multilingual corpora.

In frame-based terminology, conceptual networks are based on an underlying domain event, which generates templates for the actions and processes that take place in the specialized field as well as the entities that participate in them.

As a result, knowledge extraction is largely text-based. The terminological entries are composed of information from specialized texts as well as specialized language resources. Knowledge is configured and represented in a dynamic conceptual network that is capable of adapting to new contexts. At the most general level, generic roles of agent, patient, result, and instrument are activated by basic predicate meanings such as make, do, affect, use, become, etc. which structure the basic meanings in specialized texts. From a linguistic perspective, [[Lexical aspect|Aktionsart]] distinctions in texts are based on [[Robert Van Valin, Jr.|Van Valin]]'s classification of predicate types. At the more specific levels of the network, the qualia structure of the [[generative lexicon]] is used as a basis for the systematic classification and relation of nominal entities.

The methodology of frame-based terminology derives the conceptual system of the domain by means of an integrated top-down and bottom-up approach. The bottom-up approach consists of extracting information from a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of texts in various languages, specifically related to the domain. The top-down approach includes the information provided by specialized dictionaries and other reference material, complemented by the help of experts in the field. 

In a parallel way, the underlying conceptual framework of a knowledge-domain event is specified. The most generic or base-level categories of a domain are configured in a prototypical domain event or action-environment interface. This provides a template applicable to all levels of information structuring. In this way a structure is obtained which facilitates and enhances knowledge acquisition since the information in term entries is internally as well as externally coherent.

In [[mathematical logic]], a '''Gödel numbering''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that assigns to each symbol and [[well-formed formula]] of some [[formal language]] a unique [[natural number]], called its '''Gödel number'''. The concept was used by [[Kurt Gödel]] for the proof of his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]]. ({{harvnb|Gödel|1931}})

A Gödel numbering can be interpreted as an [[Semantics encoding|encoding]] in which a number is assigned to each [[symbol]] of a [[mathematical notation]], after which a sequence of [[natural number]]s can then represent a sequence of symbols. These sequences of natural numbers can again be represented by single natural numbers, facilitating their manipulation in formal theories of arithmetic.

Since the publishing of Gödel's paper in 1931, the term "Gödel numbering" or "Gödel code" has been used to refer to more general assignments of natural numbers to mathematical objects.

== Simplified overview ==
Gödel noted that statements within a system can be represented by natural numbers. The significance of this was that properties of statements - such as their truth and falsehood - would be equivalent to determining whether their Gödel numbers had certain properties. The numbers involved might be very long indeed (in terms of number of digits), but this is not a barrier; all that matters is that we can show such numbers can be constructed.

In simple terms, we devise a method by which every formula or statement that can be formulated in our system gets a unique number, in such a way that we can mechanically convert back and forth between formulas and Gödel numbers. Clearly there are many ways this can be done. Given any statement, the number it is converted to is known as its Gödel number. A simple example is the way in which English is stored as a sequence of numbers in computers using [[ASCII]] or [[Unicode]]:
:* The word '''&lt;tt&gt;HELLO&lt;/tt&gt;''' is represented by 72-69-76-76-79 using decimal [[ASCII]].
:* The logical statement '''&lt;tt&gt;x=y =&gt; y=x&lt;/tt&gt;''' is represented by 120-61-121-32-61-62-32-121-61-120 using decimal ASCII.

== Gödel's encoding ==
Gödel used a system based on [[prime factorization]]. He first assigned a unique natural number to each basic symbol in the formal language of arithmetic with which he was dealing.

To encode an entire formula, which is a sequence of symbols, Gödel used the following system. Given a sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; of positive integers, the Gödel encoding of the sequence is the product of the first ''n'' primes raised to their corresponding values in the sequence:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{enc}(x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n) = 2^{x_1}\cdot 3^{x_2}\cdot 5^{x_3}\cdots p_n^{x_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

According to the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], any number (and, in particular, a number obtained in this way) can be uniquely factored into [[prime factor]]s, so it is possible to recover the original sequence from its Gödel number (for any given number n of symbols to be encoded).

Gödel specifically used this scheme at two levels: first, to encode sequences of symbols representing formulas, and second, to encode sequences of formulas representing proofs. This allowed him to show a correspondence between statements about natural numbers and statements about the provability of theorems about natural numbers, the key observation of the proof.

There are more sophisticated (and more concise) ways to construct a [[Gödel numbering for sequences]].

== Example ==

In the specific Gödel numbering used by  Nagel and Newman, the Gödel number for the symbol "0" is 6 and the Gödel number for the symbol "=" is 5. Thus, in their system, the Gödel number of the formula "0 = 0" is 2&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; × 3&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; × 5&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = 243,000,000.

== Lack of uniqueness ==

A Gödel numbering is not unique, in that for any proof using Gödel numbers, there are infinitely many ways in which these numbers could be defined.

For example, supposing there are ''K'' basic symbols, an alternative Gödel numbering could be constructed by invertibly mapping this set of symbols (through, say, an [[invertible function]] ''h'') to the set of digits of a [[Bijective numeration|bijective base-''K'' numeral system]]. A formula consisting of a string of ''n'' symbols &lt;math&gt; s_1 s_2 s_3 \dots s_n&lt;/math&gt; would then be mapped to the number

:&lt;math&gt; h(s_1) \times K^{(n-1)} + h(s_2) \times K^{(n-2)} + \cdots + h(s_{n-1}) \times K^1 + h(s_n) \times K^0 .&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, by placing the set of ''K'' basic symbols in some fixed order, such that the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;''th''&lt;/sup&gt; symbol corresponds uniquely to the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;''th''&lt;/sup&gt; digit of a bijective base-''K'' numeral system, ''each formula may serve just as the very numeral of its own Gödel number.''

For example, the numbering described [[Proof sketch for Gödel's first incompleteness theorem#G.C3.B6del numbering|here]] has K=10000.

== Application to formal arithmetic ==

===Recursion===
{{main|Course-of-values recursion}}
One may use Gödel numbering to show how functions defined by [[course-of-values recursion]] are in fact [[primitive recursive function]]s.

===Expressing statements and proofs by numbers===
{{main|Proof sketch for Gödel's first incompleteness theorem}}
Once a Gödel numbering for a formal theory is established, each [[rule of inference|inference rule]] of the theory can be expressed as a function on the natural numbers. If ''f'' is the Gödel mapping and if formula ''C'' can be derived from formulas ''A'' and ''B'' through an inference rule ''r''; i.e.
:&lt;math&gt; A, B \vdash_r C, &lt;/math&gt;
then there should be some [[arithmetical function]] ''g&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' of natural numbers such that
:&lt;math&gt; g_r(f(A),f(B)) = f(C). &lt;/math&gt;
This is true for the numbering Gödel used, and for any other numbering where the encoded formula can be arithmetically recovered from its Gödel number.

Thus, in a formal theory such as [[Peano arithmetic]] in which one can make statements about numbers and their arithmetical relationships to each other, one can use a Gödel numbering to indirectly make statements about the theory itself. This technique allowed Gödel to prove results about the consistency and completeness properties of [[formal system]]s.

== Generalizations ==

In [[computability theory]], the term "Gödel numbering" is used in settings more general than the one described above. It can refer to:
#Any assignment of the elements of a [[formal language]] to natural numbers in such a way that the numbers can be manipulated by an [[algorithm]] to simulate manipulation of elements of the formal language.
#More generally, an assignment of elements from a countable mathematical object, such as a countable [[group (mathematics)|group]], to natural numbers to allow algorithmic manipulation of the mathematical object.

Also, the term Gödel numbering is sometimes used when the assigned "numbers" are actually strings, which is necessary when considering models of computation such as [[Turing machine]]s that manipulate strings rather than numbers. 
&lt;!--
There is a very different meaning of the term Gödel numbering relating to 
[[numbering (computability theory)|numberings]] of the class of [[computable function]]s. COMMENTED OUT PER TALK --&gt;

==Gödel  sets==
Gödel  sets are sometimes used in set theory to encode formulas, and are similar to Gödel  numbers, except that one uses sets rather than numbers to do the encoding. In simple cases when one uses a [[hereditarily finite set]] to encode formulas this is essentially equivalent to the use of Gödel numbers, but somewhat easier to define because the tree structure of formulas can be modeled by the tree structure of sets.  Gödel  sets can also be used to encode formulas in [[infinitary logic|infinitary languages]].

The '''''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences''''' was first [[publish]]ed in 1968 and was edited by [[David L. Sills]] and [[Robert K. Merton]]. It contains seventeen volumes and thousands of entries written by scholars around the world. The 2nd edition is composed entirely of new articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gale.cengage.com/servlet/ItemDetailServlet?region=9&amp;imprint=000&amp;titleCode=M83&amp;type=4&amp;cf=p&amp;id=194787 |title=Gale Catalog – International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences, Edition 2 |publisher=Gale.cengage.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in 2008 and edited by [[William A.

Though the 1968 '''''Encyclopedia''''' was initially intended to "complement, not supplant" MacMillan's earlier, fifteen-volume '''''[[Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences]]''''', which had been published from 1930 to 1967 and was edited by American economists [[Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman]] and [[Alvin Saunders Johnson]], it effectively replaced the earlier '''''Encyclopaedia''''', in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1237578|title=The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences: A Review Article|first=James P.|last=Cavin|date=1 January 1969|publisher=|journal=American Journal of Agricultural Economics|volume=51|issue=2|pages=268–278|via=|doi=10.2307/1237578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopaedia of Social Sciences, Inc.

'''Kathryn Bridges Harley Clancy''' (also known as '''Kate Clancy''') is an American [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] who specialises in [[reproductive health]]. She is Associate Professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], in the Department of [[Anthropology]]. Her additional research and policy advocacy work focuses on [[sexual harassment]] in [[science]] and [[Academy|academia]].

== Fertility research ==
Clancy's [[fertility]] research focuses on menstruation and variability in [[Endometrium|endometrial]] function. Clancy's early published research demonstrated that, contrary to previous belief, menstruation does not increase risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Instead, Clancy and colleagues show that a thicker endometrium is associated with greater iron reserves amongst healthy women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B. H.|last2=Nenko|first2=Ilona|last3=Jasienska|first3=Grazyna|date=September 2006|title=Menstruation does not cause anemia: endometrial thickness correlates positively with erythrocyte count and hemoglobin concentration in premenopausal women|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|volume=18|issue=5|pages=710–713|doi=10.1002/ajhb.20538|issn=1042-0533|pmid=16917885}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clancy's later studies focus on rural Polish populations. Clancy explores potential variation amongst endometrial function, or the functions of the inner mucous membrane layer of the [[uterus]]. Her research finds that endometrial thickness is negatively correlated over the latter phase of the menstrual cycle (the [[luteal phase]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B.H.|date=2007-09-01|title=Unexpected luteal endometrial decline in a healthy rural Polish population|url=http://www.ejog.org/article/S0301-2115(06)00461-1/fulltext|journal=European Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology and Reproductive Biology|language=English|volume=134|issue=1|pages=133–134|doi=10.1016/j.ejogrb.2006.07.041|issn=0301-2115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clancy's research contributes to understandings of fertility variation amongst normal, premenopausal Western women. For example, Swedish women appear to show an increase in endometrial thickness in the early part of the luteal phase, while for Canadian and English women, patterns appear largely stable at similar times. Canadian and Swedish women's endometrial thickness drops at other times, and while for Scottish sample, there is an increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CLANCY|first=KATHRYN B.H.|last2=ELLISON|first2=PETER T.|last3=JASIENSKA|first3=GRAZYNA|last4=BRIBIESCAS|first4=RICHARD G.|date=2009|title=Endometrial thickness is not independent of luteal phase day in a rural Polish population|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase/117/3/117_090130/_html|journal=Anthropological Science|language=en|volume=117|issue=3|pages=157–163|doi=10.1537/ase.090130|issn=0918-7960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clancy and colleagues' research suggests that endometrial thickness should be measured daily to better capture and study this variation.

Clancy has also made a broader contribution to the study of human evolutionary biology and ecological stress on ovaries and endometrial function. She finds that immune stress and psychosocial stress impacts on the endometrium's ability to carry a fetus through the mechanism of inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B.H.|date=2009-01-01|title=Reproductive ecology and the endometrium: Physiology, variation, and new directions|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.21188/abstract|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=140|issue=S49|pages=137–154|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21188|issn=1096-8644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clancy's later research focuses on primate development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781461440598|title=Building Babies - Primate Development in Proximate and {{!}} Kathryn B.H.

On Menstrual Synchrony|last=Clancy|first=Kate|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual harassment research ==
Clancy is part of a team of [[anthropologist]]s who led the '''Survey of Academic Field Experiences''' study,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B. H.|last2=Nelson|first2=Robin G.|last3=Rutherford|first3=Julienne N.|last4=Hinde|first4=Katie|date=2014-07-16|title=Survey of Academic Field Experiences (SAFE): Trainees Report Harassment and Assault|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0102172|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=9|issue=7|pages=e102172|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0102172|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as [[SAFE13 Study|SAFE13]]. The study, co-authored with Robin G. Nelson, Julienne N. Rutherford and Katie Hinde, analysed experiences of sexual harassment and [[sexual assault]] in scientific fieldwork sites. The study found the majority of researchers had been exposed to, or experienced, sexual harassment, especially women and junior scientists.

A follow-up study (known as "'''SAFE 2'''"), led by Nelson, Rutherford, Hinde and Clancy identified systemic patterns that lead to negative fieldwork experiences and harassment. Field sites that have clear codes of conduct and consequences for behaviour are less likely to lead to sexual harassment. Where problems arise, these sites deal with issues swiftly and consistently, leading to higher levels of perceived safety and equality. In fieldwork sites where clear rules and consequences do not exist or are ambiguous, leaders do not take action against harassment. This leads to ongoing alienation and professional retaliation.

The SAFE13 study and subsequent research and activities (media interviews, conferences and advocacy) have made significant impact on increasing awareness of institutional responses to sexual harassment, as well as policy reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marieclaire.com/career-advice/a14104684/sexual-harassment-assault-in-science-field/|title="It Gnaws Away at Me": Female Scientists Report a Horrifying Culture of Sexual Assault|date=2017-12-11|work=Marie Claire|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 2018, Clancy, provided testimony to the Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing on sexual harassment in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/subcommittee-research-and-technology-hearing-review-sexual-harassment-and|title=Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing - A Review of Sexual Harassment and Misconduct in Science|date=2018-02-27|work=Committee on Science, Space, and Technology|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clancy testified that creating a safe, harassment-free workplace culture was imperative to improving science.

=== Racism and gender harassment ===
In 2017, Clancy led another study on sexual harassment in collaboration with Katharine M. N. Lee, Erica M. Rodgers and Christina Richey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B.

It is the first study of its kind in the physical sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lallensack|first=Rachael|date=2017-07-20|title=Female astronomers of colour face daunting discrimination|url=https://www.nature.com/news/female-astronomers-of-colour-face-daunting-discrimination-1.22291|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=547|issue=7663|pages=266–267|doi=10.1038/nature.2017.22291}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is the first large study to examine both gender and racial harassment in academic science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/07/its-2017-and-women-of-colour-in-science-are-still-being-harassed/|title=It's 2017, And Women Of Colour In Science Are Still Being Harassed|date=2017-07-11|work=Gizmodo Australia|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study finds that 88% of participants had heard negative language at work, along with other verbal and physical abuse that made them feel unsafe. Women of colour, however, experienced the greatest level of hostility due to their race and gender. They experienced greater incidents of gendered and racialised harassment and were more attuned to noticing other forms of harassment such as homophobia. Forty percent of women of colour feel unsafe at work due to their gender or sex, and 28% due to their race. Women of colour are also more likely to skip educational and professional opportunities, such as meetings and conferences, in an attempt to minimise exposure to hostility and harassment.

The study received wide media coverage, as it provided evidence on how harassment limits women's career outcomes, especially for racial minority women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/07/11/women-of-color-face-staggering-harassment-in-space-science/|title=Women of color face staggering harassment in space science|last=Kaplan|first=Sarah|date=2017-07-11|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clancy also noted that the study unearths how survivors are re-traumatised by existing reporting systems that have no intermediary level of support in between staying silent and launching a formal report.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study has been commended for showing how racial discrimination compounds experiences of sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/07/14/women-color-stem-face-greater-risks-gender-racial-harassment-work/467501001/|title=Women of color in STEM face greater risks of gender, racial harassment at work|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also shows that the impact of harassment contributes to a higher loss of women of colour in science relative to White women scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/azeenghorayshi/unsafe-science|title=Many Women Of Color Feel Unsafe Working In Science, New Study Finds|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study raises questions about [[Bystander effect|bystander interventions]], given the hostile culture towards women of colour is evident to witnesses, who do not feel empowered to act.

Clancy served on the [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's]] 2018 consensus report entitled "Sexual Harassment of Women: Climate, Culture, and Consequences in Academic Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-08-01|title=Sexual Harassment of Women|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24994/sexual-harassment-of-women-climate-culture-and-consequences-in-academic|language=en|doi=10.17226/24994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 2006, Clancy worked as a lecturer at [[Yale University]]. One year later, she joined [[Harvard University]] as Preceptor Faculty and Associate at the Department of Anthropology. She has worked at the University of Illinois since 2008, where she started as a lecturer and now works as an Associate Professor in Anthropology.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://anthro.illinois.edu/directory/profile/kclancy|title=Kathryn B.

'''Legal cynicism''' is a domain of [[legal socialization]] defined by a perception that the legal system and [[law enforcement]] agents are "illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure [[public safety]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kirk |first=David S. |last2=Matsuda |first2=Mauri |date=2011-05-01 |title=Legal Cynicism, Collective Efficacy, and the Ecology of Arrest |journal=Criminology |language=en |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=443–472 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.2011.00226.x |issn=1745-9125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cjb&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Reisig |first=Michael D.  |last2=Scott E.

==Definitions==
[[Robert J. Sampson|Sampson]] and Bartusch (1998) defined legal cynicism as ""[[anomie]]" about law".&lt;ref name=sb1998/&gt; Based on Sampson &amp; Bartusch's work, and on that of [[Leo Srole]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Srole |first=Leo |date=1956 |title=Social Integration and Certain Corollaries: An Exploratory Study |jstor=2088422 |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=709–716 |doi=10.2307/2088422}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alex Piquero|Piquero]] et al. (2005) defined it based on respondents' answers to a five-question survey. In the survey, respondents were asked to rank, on a four-point scale, the extent to which they agreed with each of these statements: 
{{blockquote|
# Laws are meant to be broken, 
#It is okay to do anything you want, 
#There are no right or wrong ways to make money, 
#If I have a fight with someone, it is no one else's business, and 
#A person has to live without thinking about the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=PIQUERO |first=ALEX R. |last2=FAGAN |first2=JEFFREY |last3=MULVEY |first3=EDWARD P. |last4=STEINBERG |first4=LAURENCE |last5=ODGERS |first5=CANDICE |date=2005-09-01 |title=DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES OF LEGAL SOCIALIZATION AMONG SERIOUS ADOLESCENT OFFENDERS |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2776646/ |journal=The Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=267–298 |issn=0091-4169 |pmc=2776646 |pmid=19915683}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Causes and correlates==
Legal cynicism can be exacerbated when police engage in aggressive misconduct in a community, which can lead to greater violence and less cooperation between the community's citizens and the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/2016/9/30/13115224/crime-violent-reduce-ferguson-murder-fbi-ucr |title=The surge in violent crime is overblown — but here's how to combat it |last=Abt |first=Thomas |date=2016-09-30 |website=Vox |access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found to be higher in neighborhoods with higher levels of [[concentrated disadvantage]], even after controlling for demographic factors and crime rates.&lt;ref name=sb1998&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sampson |first=Robert J. |last2=Bartusch |first2=Dawn Jeglum |date=1998 |title=Legal Cynicism and (Subcultural?)

The '''linear no-threshold model''' ('''LNT''') is a model used in [[radiation protection]] to quantify radiation exposure and set regulatory limits. It is most frequently used to calculate the probability of [[radiation induced cancer]] at both high doses where [[epidemiology]] studies support its application but, controversially, it likewise finds applications in calculating the effects of low doses, a dose region that is fraught with much less [[statistical significance|statistical confidence]] in its predictive power but that nonetheless has resulted in major personal and policy decisions in regards to [[public health]]. The model assumes that the long-term, biological damage caused by [[ionizing radiation]] (essentially the cancer risk) is directly proportional to the [[Effective dose (radiation)|dose]]. This allows the summation by [[dosimeter]]s of all radiation exposure, without taking into consideration dose levels or dose rates.&lt;ref&gt;"In the absence of more conclusive data, scientists have assumed that even the smallest radiation exposure carries a risk." [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/rc00152.pdf GAO study]&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, radiation is always considered harmful with no safety threshold, and the sum of several very small exposures are considered to have the same effect as one larger exposure (response linearity).

One of the organizations for establishing recommendations on radiation protection guidelines internationally, the [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation|UNSCEAR]], recommended in 2014 policies that do not agree with the Linear No-Threshold model at exposure levels below background levels of radiation to the UN General Assembly from the Fifty-Ninth Session of the Committee. Its recommendation states that "the Scientific Committee does not recommend multiplying very low doses by large numbers of individuals to estimate numbers of radiation-induced health effects within a population exposed to incremental doses at levels equivalent to or lower than natural background levels." This is a reversal from previous recommendations by the same organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/V12/553/85/PDF/V1255385.pdf?OpenElement |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805144608/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/V12/553/85/PDF/V1255385.pdf?OpenElement |archivedate=5 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }} UNSCEAR Fifty-Ninth Session 21–25 May 2012 | Published 14 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three active (2016) challenges to the LNT model currently being considered by the US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]. One was filed by [[Nuclear Medicine]] Professor Carol Marcus of [[UCLA]], who calls the LNT model scientific "baloney".&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-a-little-radiation-so-bad-1471014742  Is a Little Dose of Radiatoion So Bad?], ''Wall Street Journal'', Aug 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the model describes the reality for small-dose exposures is disputed. It opposes two competing schools of thought: the [[threshold model]], which assumes that very small exposures are harmless, and the [[radiation hormesis]] model, which claims that radiation at very small doses can be beneficial. Because the current data are inconclusive, scientists disagree on which model should be used. Pending any definitive answer to these questions and the [[precautionary principle]], the model is sometimes used to quantify the cancerous effect of [[collective dose]]s of low-level radioactive contaminations, even though it estimates a positive number of excess deaths at levels that would have had zero deaths, or saved lives, in the two other models. Such practice has been condemned by the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=ICRP%20Publication%20103 ICRP publication 103], §66&lt;/ref&gt;

The LNT model is sometimes applied to other cancer hazards such as [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s in drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/safewater/contaminants/dw_contamfs/pcbs.html  ''Consumer Factsheet on: polychlorinated biphenyls'']  US Environment Protection Agency.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Increased risk with dose.svg|thumb|right|Increased Risk of Solid Cancer with Dose for [[Hibakusha|A-bomb survivors]], from BEIR report. Notably this exposure pathway occurred from essentially a massive spike or pulse of radiation, a result of the brief instant that the bomb exploded, which while somewhat similar to the environment of a [[CT scan]], it is wholly unlike the low ''[[dose rate]]'' of living in a contaminated area such as [[Chernobyl]], were the ''dose rate'' is orders of magnitude smaller. However LNT does not consider [[dose rate]] and is an unsubstantiated [[one size fits all]] approach based solely on total [[absorbed dose]]. When the two environments and cell effects are vastly different. Likewise, it has also been pointed out that bomb survivors inhaled carcinogenic [[benzopyrene]] from the burning cities, yet this is not factored in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Radiology|date=April 2009 |volume= 251|issue=1|pages= 13–22|doi= 10.1148/radiol.2511080671|pmid=19332842 |pmc= 2663584|title=The Linear No-Threshold Relationship Is Inconsistent with Radiation Biologic and Experimental Data|last1=Tubiana |first1=M. |last2=Feinendegen |first2=L. E. |last3=Yang |first3=C. |last4=Kaminski |first4=J. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The association of exposure to radiation with cancer had been observed as early as 1902, six years after the discovery of [[X-ray]] by [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] and [[radioactivity]] by [[Henri Becquerel]].&lt;ref name="kathren"&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://scholars.unh.edu/unh_lr/vol1/iss1/5/|journal=University of New Hampshire Law Review |volume= 1|issue= 1|date=December 2002 |title=Historical Development of the Linear Nonthreshold Dose-Response Model as Applied to Radiation|author=Ronald L. Kathren }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, [[Hermann Joseph Muller|Hermann Muller]] demonstrated that radiation may cause genetic mutation and suggested that the mutation rate may be related to dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The early studies were based on relatively high levels of radiation that made it hard to establish the safety of low level of radiation, and many scientists at that time believed that there may be a tolerance level, and that low doses of radiation may not be harmful. A later study in 1955 on mice exposed to low dose of radiation suggest that they may outlive control animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Long-Term Effects of Acute and Chronic Irradiation in Mice.

Although compelling evidence on the effect of low dosage of radiation was hard to come by, by the late 1940s, the idea of LNT became more popular due to its mathematical simplicity.  In 1954, the [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] (NCRP) introduced the concept of maximum permissible dose. In 1958, [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] (UNSCEAR) assessed the LNT model and a threshold model, but noted the difficulty in acquiring "reliable information about the correlation between small doses and their effects either in individuals or in large populations". The [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy]] (JCAE) similarly could not establish if there is a threshold or "safe" level for exposure, nevertheless it introduced the concept of "[[ALARP|As Low As Reasonably Achievable]]" (ALARA). ALARA would become a fundamental principle in radiation protection policy that implicitly accepts the validity of LNT.  In 1959, United States Federal Radiation Council (FRC) supported the concept of the LNT extrapolation down to the low dose region in its first report.&lt;ref name="kathren"/&gt; 

By the 1970s, the LNT model had become accepted as the standard in radiation protection practice by a number of bodies.&lt;ref name="kathren"/&gt;  In 1972, the first report of National Academy of Sciences (NAS) [[Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation]] (BEIR), an expert panel who reviewed available peer reviewed literature, supported the LNT model on pragmatic grounds, noting that while "dose-effect relationship for x rays and gamma rays may not be a linear function", the "use of linear extrapolation . . . may be justified on pragmatic grounds as a basis for risk estimation." In its seventh report of 2006, NAS BEIR VII writes, "the committee concludes that the preponderance of information indicates that there will be some risk, even at low doses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/reports-in-brief/beir_vii_final.pdf |title=Beir VII: Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation |work= The National Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radiation precautions and public policy==
{{See also|Health effects of sun exposure}}
Radiation precautions have led to [[sunlight]] being listed as a carcinogen at all sun exposure rates, due to the [[ultraviolet]] component of sunlight, with no safe level of sunlight exposure being suggested, following the precautionary LNT model. According to a 2007 study submitted by the University of Ottawa to the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., there is not enough information to determine a safe level of sun exposure at this time.&lt;ref name="ODS-sheet-ref-5"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Cranney A, Horsley T, O'Donnell S, etal |title=Effectiveness and safety of vitamin D in relation to bone health |journal=Evidence Report/technology Assessment |volume= |issue=158 |pages=1–235 |date=August 2007 |pmid=18088161 |pmc=4781354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a particular dose of radiation is found to produce one extra case of a type of cancer in every thousand people exposed, LNT projects that one thousandth of this dose will produce one extra case in every million people so exposed, and that one millionth of the original dose will produce one extra case in every billion people exposed. The conclusion is that any given [[dose equivalent]] of radiation will produce the same number of cancers, no matter how thinly it is spread.

The model is simple to apply: a quantity of radiation can be translated into a number of deaths without any adjustment for the distribution of exposure, including the distribution of exposure within a single exposed individual. For example, a [[hot particle]] embedded in an organ (such as lung) results in a very high dose in the cells directly adjacent to the [[hot particle]], but a much lower whole-organ and whole-body dose. Thus, even if a safe low dose threshold was found to exist at cellular level for radiation induced [[mutagenesis]], the threshold would not exist for environmental pollution with hot particles, and could not be safely assumed to exist when the distribution of dose is unknown.

The linear no-threshold model is used to extrapolate the expected number of extra deaths caused by exposure to [[environmental radiation]], and it therefore has a great impact on [[public policy]]. The model is used to translate any [[radiation release]], like that from a "[[dirty bomb]]", into a number of lives lost, while any reduction in [[Ionizing radiation|radiation exposure]], for example as a consequence of [[radon]] detection, is translated into a number of lives saved. When the doses are very low, at natural background levels, in the absence of evidence, the model predicts via extrapolation, new cancers only in a very small fraction of the population, but for a large population, the number of lives is extrapolated into hundreds or thousands, and this can sway public policy.

A linear model has long been used in [[health physics]] to set maximum acceptable radiation exposures.

The United States-based [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] (NCRP), a body commissioned by the [[United States Congress]], recently released a report written by the national experts in the field which states that, radiation's effects should be considered to be proportional to the dose an individual receives, regardless of how small the dose is.

A 1958 analysis of two decades of research on the mutation rate of 1 million lab mice showed that six major hypotheses about ionizing radiation and gene mutation were not supported by data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/128/3338/1546.long |title=Radiation dose rate and mutation frequency. |author=Russell WL, Russell LB, Kelly EM.|journal= Science|date= December 19, 1958 |volume=128|issue=3338|pages=1546–50 |pmid=13615306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its data was used in 1972 by the [[Committee on the Biological Effects of lonizing Radiation|Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation I]] committee to support the LNT model. However, it has been claimed that the data contained a fundamental error that was not revealed to the committee, and would not support the LNT model on the issue of mutations and may suggest a threshold dose ''rate'' under which radiation does not produce any mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://phys.org/news/2017-01-calabrese-lnt-toxicology.html |title=Calabrese says mistake led to adopting the LNT model in toxicology |date=January 23, 2017 |work=Phys.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Edward J.

==Fieldwork==
The LNT model and the alternatives to it each have plausible mechanisms that could bring them about, but definitive conclusions are hard to make given the difficulty of doing [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] studies involving large [[Cohort (statistics)|cohorts]] over long periods.

A 2003 review of the various studies published in the authoritative  ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' concludes that "given our current state of knowledge, the most reasonable assumption is that the cancer risks from low doses of x- or gamma-rays decrease linearly with decreasing dose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Brenner  | first =David J  | title =Cancer risks attributable to low doses of ionizing radiation: Assessing what we really know  | journal =[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]  | volume =100  | issue =24  | pages =13761–6  | date =10 November 2003  | url =http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/100/24/13761  | doi =10.1073/pnas.2235592100  | id =  | accessdate =29 August 2007  | pmid =14610281  | pmc =283495 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study by researchers that looks at Swedish children exposed to fallout from [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] while they were fetuses between 8 and 25 weeks gestation concluded that the reduction in [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] at very low doses was greater than expected, given a simple LNT model for radiation damage, indicating that the LNT model may be too conservative when it comes to neurological damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Douglas |last=Almond |first2=Lena |last2=Edlund |first3=Mårten |last3=Palme |title=Chernobyl's Subclinical Legacy: Prenatal Exposure to Radioactive Fallout and School Outcomes in Sweden |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=124 |issue=4 |year=2009 |pages=1729–1772 |doi=10.1162/qjec.2009.124.4.1729 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in medical journals, studies detail that in Sweden in the year of the Chernobyl accident, the [[birth rate]], both increased and shifted to those of "higher [[maternal age]]" in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Odlind |first1=V |last2=Ericson |first2=A |title=Incidence of legal abortion in Sweden after the Chernobyl accident |journal=Biomedicine &amp; Pharmacotherapy |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=225–8 |year=1991 |pmid=1912377 |doi=10.1016/0753-3322(91)90021-k}}&lt;/ref&gt; More advanced maternal age in Swedish mothers was linked with a reduction in offspring IQ, in a paper published in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mikko |last=Myrskylä |first2=Karri |last2=Silventoinen |first3=Per |last3=Tynelius |first4=Finn |last4=Rasmussen |title=Is Later Better or Worse?

The doses examined varied between 0 and 500 mSv received over their working lives. These results exclude the possibilities of no increase in risk or that the risk is 2-3 times that for A-bomb survivors with a confidence level of 90%. The cancer risk for these radiation workers was still less than the average for persons in the UK due to the [[healthy worker effect]].

A 2009 study focusing on the naturally high background radiation region of [[Karunagappalli]], India concluded: "our cancer incidence study, together with previously reported cancer mortality studies in the HBR area of [[Yangjiang]], China, suggests it is unlikely that estimates of risk at low doses are substantially greater than currently believed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nair | first1 = R.

In 2011 an ''in vitro'' time-lapse study of the cellular response to low doses of radiation showed a strongly non-linear response of certain cellular repair mechanisms called radiation-induced foci (RIF).

In 2013 a data linkage study of 11 million Australians with &gt;680 000 people exposed to CT scans between 1985 and 2005 was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Darby  | first = Mathews  | title =Cancer risk in 680,000 people exposed to computed tomography scans in childhood or adolescence: data linkage study of 11 million Australians.  | journal =[[BMJ]]  | volume =346  | url =  | doi = 10.1136/bmj.f2360  | pmid=23694687  | pmc=3660619  | year=2013  | pages=f2360|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study confirmed the results of the 2012 UK study for leukaemia and brain cancer but also investigated other cancer types. The authors conclude that their results were generally consistent with the linear no threshold theory.

==Controversy==
The LNT model has been contested by a number of scientists.  It is been claimed that the early proponent of the model [[Hermann Joseph Muller]] intentionally ignored an early study that did not support the LNT model when he gave his 1946 Nobel Prize address advocating the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Calabrese, E. J.| title = Muller's Nobel lecture on dose–response for ionizing radiation:ideology or science?| date = 30 June 2011| url =http://users.physics.harvard.edu/~wilson/freshman_seminar/Radiation/Calabrese-Muller-1-1.pdf| accessdate =30 December 2011| doi = 10.1007/s00204-011-0728-8| journal = Archives of Toxicology| volume = 85| issue = 4| pages = 1495–1498| pmid=21717110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also argued that LNT model had caused an irrational fear of radiation.  In the wake of the 1986 [[Chernobyl accident]] in [[Ukraine]], Europe-wide anxieties were formented in pregnant mothers over the perception enforced by the LNT model that their children would be born with a higher rate of mutations.&lt;ref name="kasperson160"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kasperson |first1=Roger E. |last2=Stallen |first2=Pieter Jan M. |title=Communicating Risks to the Public: International Perspectives |publisher=Springer Science and Media |year=1991|location=Berlin |pages=160–2 |isbn=978-0-7923-0601-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As far afield as the country of [[Denmark]], hundreds of excess [[induced abortions]] were performed on the healthy unborn, out of this no-threshold fear.&lt;ref name="autogenerated443"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5271/sjweh.1761 |title=The Chernobyl accident and induced abortions: Only one-way information |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment &amp; Health |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=443–4 |year=1990 |last1=Perucchi |first1=M |last2=Domenighetti |first2=G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the accident however, studies of data sets approaching a million births in the [[EUROCAT (medicine)|EUROCAT]] database, divided into "exposed" and control groups were assessed in 1999. As no Chernobyl impacts were detected, the researchers conclude "in retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn was not justified".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ije/28.5.941 |pmid=10597995 |title=Evaluation of the impact of Chernobyl on the prevalence of congenital anomalies in 16 regions of Europe.

In [[Radiation therapy#Effects on reproduction|very high dose radiation therapy]], it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies, however, human exposure data and animal testing suggests that the "malformation of organs appears to be a [[deterministic effect]] with a [[Dose–response relationship|threshold dose]]" below which, no rate increase is observed.&lt;ref name="ecolo.org"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(sici)1096-9926(199908)60:2&lt;100::aid-tera14&gt;3.3.co;2-8 |pmid=10440782 |title=Teratogen update: Radiation and chernobyl |journal=Teratology |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=100–6 |year=1999 |last1=Castronovo |first1=Frank P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in 1999 on the link between the Chernobyl accident and [[teratology]] (birth defects) concludes that "there is no substantive proof regarding radiation‐induced teratogenic effects from the Chernobyl accident".&lt;ref name="ecolo.org"/&gt; It is argued that the human body has defense mechanisms, such as [[DNA repair]] and [[programmed cell death]], that would protect it against carcinogenesis due to low-dose exposures of carcinogens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://schachtmanlaw.com/the-mythology-of-linear-no-threshold-cancer-causation/ The Mythology of Linear No-Threshold Cancer Causation]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ramsar, Mazandaran|Ramsar]], located in [[Iran]], is often quoted as being a counter example to LNT.

Retrieved on 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11340&amp;page=335 quoted text available at]. Nap.edu (1 June 2003). Retrieved on 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The assumption that any stimulatory hormetic effects from low doses of ionizing radiation will have a significant health benefit to humans that exceeds potential detrimental effects from the radiation exposure is unwarranted at this time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* In 2005 the United States National Academies' National Research Council published its comprehensive meta-analysis of low-dose radiation research BEIR VII, Phase 2. In its press release the Academies stated:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=11340 NAS. Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation May Cause Harm. Press Release, 29 June 2005. Retrieved on 17 December 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The scientific research base shows that there is no threshold of exposure below which low levels of ionizing radiation can be demonstrated to be harmless or beneficial.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* The [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] (a body commissioned by the [[United States Congress]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncrppublications.org/index.cfm?fm=Product.AddToCart&amp;pid=6714063164 NCRP report]. Ncrppublications.org. Retrieved on 5 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed the LNT model in a 2001 report that attempted to survey existing literature critical of the model.
* The [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] (UNSCEAR) wrote in its 2000 report&lt;ref&gt;UNSCEAR 2000 REPORT Vol. II: Sources and Effects of Ionizing Radiation: Annex G: Biological effects at low radiation doses. page 160, paragraph 541. Available online at [http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/annexg.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Until the [...] uncertainties on low-dose response are resolved, the Committee believes that an increase in the risk of tumour induction proportionate to the radiation dose is consistent with developing knowledge and that it remains, accordingly, the most scientifically defensible approximation of low-dose response. However, a strictly linear dose response should not be expected in all circumstances.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] also endorses the LNT model in its 2011 report on radiogenic cancer risk:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-05/documents/bbfinalversion.pdf |title=EPA Radiogenic Cancer Risk Models and Projections for the U.S. Population |publisher=EPA |date=April 2011 |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Underlying the risk models is a large body of epidemiological and radiobiological data. In general, results from both lines of research are consistent with a linear, no-threshold dose (LNT) response model in which the risk of inducing a cancer in an irradiated tissue by low doses of radiation is proportional to the dose to that tissue.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Oppose
A number of organisations disagree with using the Linear no-threshold model to estimate risk from environmental and occupational low-level radiation exposure:

* The [[French Academy of Sciences]] (''Académie des Sciences'') and the National Academy of Medicine (''[[Académie Nationale de Médecine]]'') published a report in 2005 (at the same time as BEIR VII report in the United States) that rejected the Linear no-threshold model in favor of a threshold dose response and a significantly reduced risk at low radiation exposure:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Heyes| title = Authors' reply| date = 1 October 2006| url = http://bjr.birjournals.org/cgi/content/citation/79/946/855| accessdate =27 March 2008| doi = 10.1259/bjr/52126615| journal = British Journal of Radiology| volume = 79| issue = 946| pages = 855–857|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Aurengo| title = Dose-effect relationships and estimation of the carcinogenic effects of low doses of ionizing radiation.| publisher = Académie des Sciences &amp; Académie nationale de Médecine| date = 30 March 2005| url = http://www.radscihealth.org/rsh/Papers/FrenchAcadsFinal07_04_05.pdf| accessdate = 27 March 2008| display-authors = etal| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725061127/http://www.radscihealth.org/rsh/Papers/FrenchAcadsFinal07_04_05.pdf| archivedate = 25 July 2011| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In conclusion, this report raises doubts on the validity of using LNT for evaluating the carcinogenic risk of low doses (&lt; 100 mSv) and even more for very low doses (&lt; 10 mSv). The LNT concept can be a useful pragmatic tool for assessing rules in radioprotection for doses above 10 mSv;  however since it is not based on biological concepts of our current knowledge, it should not be used without precaution for assessing by extrapolation the risks associated with low and even more so, with very low doses (&lt; 10 mSv), especially for benefit-risk assessments imposed on radiologists by the European directive 97-43.}}

* The [[Health Physics Society]]'s position statement first adopted in January 1996, as revised in July 2010, states:&lt;ref&gt;Health Physics Society, 2010. Radiation Risk in Perspective  '''PS010-2''' [http://hps.org/documents/risk_ps010-2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In accordance with current knowledge of radiation health risks, the Health Physics Society recommends against quantitative estimation of health risks below an individual dose of 5 rem (50 mSv)  in one year or a lifetime dose of 10 rem (100 mSv) above that received from natural sources. Doses from natural background radiation in the United States average about 0.3 rem (3 mSv) per year. A dose of 5 rem (50 mSv) will be accumulated in the first 17 years of life and about 25 rem (250 mSv) in a lifetime of 80 years. Estimation of health risk associated with radiation doses that are of similar magnitude as those received from natural sources should be strictly qualitative and encompass a range of hypothetical health outcomes, including the possibility of no adverse health effects at such low levels.}}

* The [[American Nuclear Society]] recommended further research on the Linear No Threshold Hypothesis before making adjustments to current radiation protection guidelines, concurring with the Health Physics Society's position that:&lt;ref&gt;The American Nuclear Society, 2001. Health Effects of Low-Level Radiation. Position Statement '''41''' [http://www.ans.org/pi/ps/docs/ps41.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;   {{quote|There is substantial and convincing scientific evidence for health risks at high dose. Below 10 rem or 100 mSv (which includes occupational and environmental exposures) risks of health effects are either too small to be observed or are non-existent.}}

;Intermediate
The US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] takes the intermediate position that "accepts the LNT hypothesis as a conservative model for estimating radiation risk", but noting that "public health data do not absolutely establish the occurrence of cancer following exposure to low doses and dose rates — below about 10,000 mrem (100 mSv). Studies of occupational workers who are chronically exposed to low levels of radiation above normal background have shown no adverse biological effects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/radiation/health-effects/rad-exposure-cancer.html |title=Radiation Exposure and Cancer |date=29 March 2012 |website=[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] |accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health effects==
{{Further|Radiophobia}}
The consequences of low-level radiation are often more [[psychological]] than radiological. Because damage from very-low-level radiation cannot be detected, people exposed to it are left in anguished uncertainty about what will happen to them. Many believe they have been fundamentally contaminated for life and may refuse to have children for fear of [[birth defect]]s. They may be shunned by others in their community who fear a sort of mysterious contagion.&lt;ref name=riv12&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/10/nuclear-risk-and-fear-from-hiroshima-to-fukushima/ |title=Nuclear Risk and Fear, from Hiroshima to Fukushima |author=[[Andrew C. Revkin]] |date=10 March 2012 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced evacuation from a radiation or nuclear accident may lead to social isolation, anxiety, depression, psychosomatic medical problems, reckless behavior, even suicide. Such was the outcome of the 1986 [[Chernobyl nuclear disaster]] in the Ukraine. A comprehensive 2005 study concluded that "the mental health impact of Chernobyl is the largest public health problem unleashed by the accident to date".&lt;ref name=riv12/&gt; [[Frank N. von Hippel]], a U.S. scientist, commented on the 2011 [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], saying that "fear of ionizing radiation could have long-term psychological effects on a large portion of the population in the contaminated areas".&lt;ref name="Frank N. von Hippel 27–36"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/5/27.full |title=The radiological and psychological consequences of the Fukushima Daiichi accident |author= Frank N. von Hippel |date= September–October 2011|volume=67|issue=5 |work= Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |pages= 27–36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such great psychological danger does not accompany other materials that put people at risk of cancer and other deadly illness. Visceral fear is not widely aroused by, for example, the daily emissions from coal burning, although, as a National Academy of Sciences study found, this causes 10,000 premature deaths a year in the US. It is "only nuclear radiation that bears a huge psychological burden — for it carries a unique historical legacy".&lt;ref name=riv12/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6249">[[File:Ma’oz Hayyim.JPG|250px|thumbnail|Ma’oz Hayyim Synagogue]]
The '''Maoz Haim Synagogue''' was originally constructed in the 3rd century as a simple [[Byzantine]]-era type [[basilica]] building, later apsidical, in the [[Beit She'an]] region in northern [[Israel]]. Discovered in February 1974 by Mr. A. Ya’aqobi during some unrelated digging near [[Maoz Haim]], it stands out as an unusual archeological find that contains a record of synagogue development from a time of otherwise sparse historiography. It was even developing right through times of anti-Judaic legislation and sermonizing.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 211&lt;/ref&gt; The [[synagogue]] was located amongst a large settlement in which it served as a center of worship for [[Jews]] there from its beginning up through its final destruction by fire sometime in the early 7th century.&lt;ref name=Levine89&gt;Levine, Lee, ed. Ancient Synagogues Revealed, 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout==
The initial layout began as a fourteen by twelve and a half meter square room with two rows of five columns with benches lining the walls, although none remained standing.&lt;ref&gt;אפרים שטרן. אנציקלופדיה החדשה לחפירות ארכיאולוגית בארץ ישראל&lt;/ref&gt; There was a single entrance eastward which is considered to be unusual. Most synagogues, aside from others which were located in the same northern Galil region, did not share this feature. However, it is mentioned in rabbinic sources as part of the synagogue layout in order to emulate the eastward entrance utilized by the [[Tabernacle]].&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 199&lt;/ref&gt; The focal point of the synagogue was located southward, towards [[Jerusalem]]. Such an orientation had not previously been a feature of synagogues of the era, but was a new custom which was just beginning to take hold.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 195&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially noticeable with remodeling which was done in the 4th century, altering the synagogue to feature an apse in the southern wall. While the synagogue did not originally have a narthex, one was added during the later phases of building to the north, although it was totally destroyed. The later phases also added an additional entrance to the north, presumably to allow for easier access to the sanctuary.

==Apse==
The apse, where the Torah Shrine had previously stood in the first phase of the synagogue, was further modified in the 6th century to include a raised platform enclosed by a [[chancel screen]] which may have been used to emphasize the sanctity of the Torah shrine area as compared to the rest of the synagogue or the congregation.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, Steven. This Holy Place: On the Sanctity of the Synagogue During the Greco-Roman Period, 222&lt;/ref&gt; Such separations were very common in ancient synagogues and the raised [[bima]] area is what shows that this was no exception.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee, ed. Ancient Synagogues Revealed, 87&lt;/ref&gt; The area of the screen depicted a menorah as well as [[Hebrew]] letters. The only Hebrew word in the entire building was [[Shalom]]; the remainder of the inscriptions were in [[Greek language|Greek]].

Behind the bima there was an area, possibly a geniza, in which several coins, pottery, and glass were found, which were amongst the few artifacts that were found at all at the site. The coins themselves were from the Byzantine era and helped identify the stages of building and development. More coins, fifty in all, were found outside the southern wall which were most likely hidden there amongst broken roof tiles in order to serve as a possible emergency funds, although the original owner never had the chance to claim them.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee, ed. Ancient Synagogues Revealed, 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mosaic Floor==
There were many interesting [[mosaic]]s which were found at the dig site. The only figures found were birds, but there were also many Jewish symbols portrayed in mosaic form, including a [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], an [[etrog]], a [[shofar]] and grapes. However, the symbols and birds were covered up in the 7th century, transforming the synagogue into one which was aniconic, likely as an act of piety.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 367&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to this, the majority of the remaining floor was primarily composed of [[geometric patterns]]. Geometric patterns were popular before as in the earliest layer to an extent, but likely were especially valued in an aniconic society. However, it was not well preserved in the upper layers due to the aforementioned destruction of uncertain cause and additional construction that occurred by the local populace afterwards.&lt;ref name=Levine89/&gt; Despite this, the mosaic floor from the initial stage of construction was better preserved as it had been filled in with approximately 30 centimeters of dirt to lay the new aniconic floor, although not many artifacts were found within it.

'''Music engraving''' is the [[art]] of drawing [[music notation]] at high quality for the purpose of mechanical reproduction. The term ''music copying'' is almost equivalent—though ''music engraving'' implies a higher degree of skill and quality, usually for publication. The name of the process originates in plate engraving, a widely used technique dating from the late sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Four Hundred Years of Music Printing|last = King|first = A. Hyatt|publisher = Trustees of the British Museum|year = 1968|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''engraving'' is now used to refer to any high-quality method of drawing [[music notation]], particularly on a [[computer]] ("computer engraving" or "computer setting") or by hand ("hand engraving").

== Traditional engraving techniques ==

=== Elements of music engraving style ===
Mechanical music engraving began in the middle of the fifteenth century. As [[musical composition]] increased in complexity, so too did the technology required to produce accurate [[Sheet music|musical score]]s. Unlike literary printing, which mainly contains printed words, music engraving communicates several different types of information simultaneously. To be clear to musicians, it is imperative that engraving techniques allow absolute precision. Notes of [[Chord (music)|chords]], [[Dynamics (music)|dynamic markings]], and other notation line up with vertical accuracy. If text is included, each syllable matches vertically with its assigned melody. Horizontally, subdivisions of beats are marked not only by their flags and [[Beam (music)|beams]], but also by the relative space between them on the page.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The logistics of creating such precise copies posed several problems for early music engravers, and have resulted in the development of several music engraving technologies.

=== Moveable type ===
Similar to book printing, music printing began in the fifteenth century with the use of [[moveable type]]. The central problem posed to early music engravers using moveable type was the proper integration of notes, staves, and text. Often, staff lines were hand drawn prior to printing, or added to the printed music afterward. [[Ottavio Petrucci]], one of the most innovative music printers working at the turn of the sixteenth century, used a triple impression technique that printed staves, text, and notes in three separate steps.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Plate engraving ===
Although [[Engraving|plate engraving]] had been used since the early fifteenth century for creating visual art and maps, it was not applied to music until 1581.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this method, a mirror image of a complete page of music was engraved onto a metal plate. Ink was then applied to the grooves, and the music print was transferred onto paper. Metal plates could be stored and reused, which made this method an attractive option for music engravers. [[Copper]] was the initial metal of choice for early plates, but by the eighteenth century [[pewter]] became the standard material due to its malleability and lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Early American Music Engraving and Printing|last = Wolfe|first = Richard J.|publisher = University of Illinois Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = Urbana, IL|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, plates were engraved freely by hand. Eventually, music engravers developed a number of tools to aid in their process, including:
* Scorers for staves and [[Bar (music)|bar lines]], the use of which inspired the term [[Sheet music|musical score]]
* Elliptical gravers for [[Dynamics (music)|crescendos and diminuendos]]
* Flat gravers for [[Tie (music)|ties]] and [[ledger lines]]
* [[Punch (tool)|Punches]] for [[note head]]s, [[clefs]], [[Accidental (music)|accidentals]], and letters&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Music Publishing in the Canadas, 1800-1867|last = Calderisi|first = Maria|publisher = National Library of Canada|year = 1981|isbn = |location = Ottawa|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plate engraving was the methodology of choice for music printing until the late nineteenth century, at which point its decline was hastened by the development of photographic technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nevertheless, the technique has survived to the present day, and is still occasionally used by select publishers such as [[G. Henle Verlag]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.henle.com/en/the-publishing-house/music-engraving/index.html|title = Music Engraving|date = |accessdate = November 3, 2014|website = G. Henle Publishers|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hand copying ===
Historically, a musician was required to draw his own [[staff (music)|staff]] lines (staves) onto blank paper. Eventually, staff paper was manufactured pre-printed with staves as a labor-saving technique. The musician could then write music directly onto the lines in pencil or ink.

In the twentieth century, music staff paper was sometimes printed on [[vellum]] or [[onionskin]]—a durable, semi-transparent material that made it easier for the musician to correct mistakes and revise the work, and also made it possible to reproduce the manuscript through the [[ozalid|ozalid process]]. Also at this time, a [[music copyist]] was often employed to hand-copy individual parts (for each performer) from a composer's full score. Neatness, speed, and accuracy were desirable traits of a skilled copyist.

=== Other techniques ===
* '''[[Lithography]]''': Similar to metal plate engraving, the music was etched onto limestone and then burned onto the surface with acid to preserve the stone plates for future use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.musicprintinghistory.org/lithography/about-lithography.html|title = About Lithography|date = |accessdate = November 3, 2014|website = Music Printing History|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Stencils''', '''stamps''', and '''dry transfers''', including the Notaset, a system inspired by the [[Letraset]] used in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.musicprintinghistory.org/stencils/transfers.html|title = Transfers|date = |accessdate = November 3, 2014|website = Music Printing History|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brushing ink through stencils was a high-quality technique used by [[Amersham]]-based company Halstan &amp; Co.
* '''Music [[typewriters]]''': Originally developed in the late nineteenth century, this technology did not become popular until the mid-1900s. The machines required the use of pre-printed [[manuscript paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.musicprintinghistory.org/music-typewriters|title = Music Typewriters|date = |accessdate = October 22, 2017|website = Music Printing History|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique produced low-quality results and was never widely used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QCgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=popular+science+1930&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AnvcTt6DBMePgwfR96XpDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCThu#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Machine Types Simplified Music."] ''Popular Science'', August 1948, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer music engraving ==
{{Main article|Scorewriter}}

With the advent of the [[personal computer]] since the 1980s, traditional music engraving has been in decline, as it can now be accomplished by computer [[software]] designed for this purpose. There are various such programs, known as [[scorewriter]]s, designed for writing, editing, printing and playing back music, though only a few produce results of a quality comparable to high-quality traditional engraving. Scorewriters have many advanced features, such as the ability to extract individual parts from an orchestral/band score, to transcribe music played on a [[MIDI]] keyboard, and conversely to play back notation via MIDI.

Beginning in the 1980s, [[WYSIWYG]] software such as [[Sibelius Software|Sibelius]], [[MuseScore]], and [[Finale (software)|Finale]] first let musicians enter complex music notation on a computer screen, displaying it just as it will look when eventually printed. Such software stores the music in files of proprietary or standardized formats, usually not directly readable by humans.

Other software, such as GNU [[LilyPond]] and [[Philip's Music Writer]], reads input from ordinary text files whose contents resemble a computer [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] programming language that describes bare musical content with little or no layout specification. The software translates the usually handwritten description into fully engraved graphical pages to view or send for printing, taking care of appearance decisions from high level layout down to glyph drawing. The music entry process is iterative and is similar to the edit-compile-execute cycle used to debug computer programs.

Beside ready-made [[Application software|applications]] there are also some [[Library (computing)|programming libraries]] for music engraving, such as [http://www.vexflow.com/ Vexflow] ([[JavaScript|Javascript]] library), [http://www.verovio.org/ Verovio] (C++, [[JavaScript|Javascript]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]]), [http://guidolib.sourceforge.net/ Guido Engine] ([[C++]] library), and [http://manufaktura-controls.com/ Manufaktura Controls] ([[.NET Framework|.NET]] libraries).  The main purpose of these libraries is to reduce time required for development of software with score rendering capabilities.

The '''Nadal formula''', also called '''Nadal's formula''', is an equation in [[railway]] design that relates the downward force exerted by a [[train]]'s wheels upon the rail, with the lateral force of the wheel's flange against the face of the rail. This relationship is significant in railway design, as a [[Derailment#Slow speed derailments|wheel-climb derailment]] may occur if the lateral and vertical forces are not properly considered.&lt;ref name=APTA&gt;[http://www.aptastandards.com/portals/0/press_pdfs/Mechanical/SS-M-015-06%20Wheel%20Flange%20Angle.pdf APTA SS-M-015-06 Standard for wheel flange angle for passenger equipment]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nadal formula is represented by:
&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{L}{V}\right){{=}}\left(\frac{\tan(\delta)-\mu}{1+\mu*\tan(\delta)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, L and V refer to the lateral and vertical forces acting upon the rail and wheel, δ is the angle made when the wheel flange is in contact with the rail face, and μ is the coefficient of friction between the wheel and the rail.&lt;ref name=APTA /&gt;

Typically, the [[axle load]] for a railway vehicle should be such that the lateral forces of the wheel against the rail should not exceed 50% of the vertical down-force of the vehicle on the rail.&lt;ref name=DOT&gt;[http://www.fra.dot.gov/downloads/Counsel/nprm/tssnprm.pdf Federal Register, July 3, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; Put another way, there should be twice as much downward force holding the wheel to the rail, as there is lateral force which will tend to cause the wheel to climb in turns. This ratio is accomplished by matching the [[Wheelset (rail transport)|wheelset]] with the appropriate [[rail profile]] to achieve the L/V ratio desired. If the L/V ratio gets too high, the wheel flange will be pressing against the rail face, and during a turn this will cause the wheel to climb the face of the rail, potentially derailing the railcar.

==Wagner Formula==

The Nadal formula assumes the wheel remains perpendicular to the rail&amp;mdash;it does not take into account [[hunting oscillation]] of the wheelset, or the movement of the wheel flange contact point against the rail.&lt;ref name="Dukkipati"&gt;{{cite book | last=Dukkipati | first=Rao | title=Vehicle Dynamics | publisher=Narosa Publishing House | year=2000 | isbn=978-81-7319-265-4 | pages=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation of the Nadal formula, which does take these factors into consideration, is the Wagner formula. As the wheelset yaws relative to the rail, the vertical force V is no longer completely vertical, but is now acting at an angle to the vertical, β. When this angle is factored into the Nadal formula, the result is the Wagner formula:&lt;ref name="Dukkipati" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{L}{V}\right){{=}}\left(\frac{\tan(\delta)-\mu*\cos\beta}{(1+\mu*\tan(\delta))*\cos\beta)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

When the vertical force is truly vertical (that is, β=0 and therefore cos(β)=1), the Wagner formula equals the Nadal formula.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10384">'''Neuro-ophthalmology''' is an academically-oriented [[subspecialty]] that merges the fields of [[neurology]] and [[ophthalmology]], often dealing with complex systemic diseases that have manifestations in the [[visual system]]. Neuro-ophthalmologists initially complete a residency in either neurology, neurosurgery, or ophthalmology, then do a [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] in the complementary field. Since diagnostic studies can be normal in patients with significant neuro-ophthalmic disease,&lt;ref name=Lessell&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lessell|first1=S|title=What can we expect in neuro-ophthalmology in the next century?|journal=Archives of Ophthalmology|date=Apr 2000|volume=118|issue=4|pages=553–4|pmid=10766142|doi=10.1001/archopht.118.4.553}}&lt;/ref&gt; a detailed [[medical history]] and [[physical exam]] is essential, and neuro-ophthalmologists often spend a significant amount of time with their patients.

Common pathology referred to a neuro-ophthalmologist includes afferent visual system disorders (e.g. [[optic neuritis]], [[optic neuropathy]], [[papilledema]], [[brain tumor]]s or [[stroke]]s) and efferent visual system disorders (e.g. [[anisocoria]], [[diplopia]], [[ophthalmoplegia]], [[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]], [[nystagmus]], [[blepharospasm]], [[seizures]] of the eye or eye muscles, and [[hemifacial spasm]]). The largest international society of neuro-ophthalmologists is the North American Neuro-Ophthalmological Society (NANOS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society|url=http://www.nanosweb.org/home.cfm|website=North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society Home Page|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which organizes an annual meeting and publishes the Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology. Neuro-ophthalmologists are often faculty at large [[Academic health science centre|university-based medical centers]]. Patients often have co-existing disease in other fields ([[rheumatology]], [[endocrinology]], [[oncology]], [[cardiology]], etc.), thus the neuro-ophthalmologist is often a liaison between the [[ophthalmology]] department and other departments in the medical center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDonnell|first1=Peter|title=Is neuro-ophthalmology in jeopardy?|journal=Ophthalmology Times|date=1 Nov 2004|volume=29|issue=21|page=4|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/15025751/neuro-ophthalmology-jeopardy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Neuro-ophthalmology focuses on diseases of the nervous system that affect vision, control of [[eye movement]]s, or [[pupillary reflex]]es. Neuro-ophthalmologists often see patients with complex multi-system disease and “[[Zebra (medicine)|zebras]]” are not uncommon. Neuro-ophthalmologists are often active teachers in their academic institution, and the first four winners of the prestigious Straatsma [[American Academy of Ophthalmology]] teaching awards were neuro-ophthalmologists.&lt;ref name=Frohman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frohman|first1=LP|title=The human resource crisis in neuro-ophthalmology.|journal=Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology|date=Sep 2008|volume=28|issue=3|pages=231–4|pmid=18769291|doi=10.1097/wno.0b013e318185e084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neuro-ophthalmology is mostly non-procedural, however, neuro-ophthalmologists may be trained to perform [[Strabismus surgery|eye muscle surgery]] to treat adult [[strabismus]], optic nerve fenestration for [[idiopathic intracranial hypertension]], and [[botulinum toxin|botulinum]] injections for [[blepharospasm]] or [[hemifacial spasm]].

Two neuro-ophthalmology fellows of Andrew G. Lee published reasons why they chose to pursue the discipline:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spitze|first1=A|last2=Al-Zubidi|first2=N|last3=Lam|first3=P|last4=Yalamanchili|first4=S|last5=Lee|first5=AG|title=Neuro-ophthalmology as a career.|journal=Indian Journal of Ophthalmology|date=October 2014|volume=62|issue=10|pages=1013–4|pmid=25449937|doi=10.4103/0301-4738.146007|pmc=4278112}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|"The neuro-ophthalmologist is often the sub-specialty that others turn to when the etiology of visual decline is in question. They are often uniquely suited to provide a global and comprehensive perspective to any complex medical, neurologic, ophthalmologic, or neurosurgical case. A neuro-ophthalmology patient has often already seen 2, if not 3 or more other specialists by the time they arrive at our door. We particularly enjoy the sense of satisfaction, medical accomplishment, and difference we can make in patient's lives when able to discover a diagnosis and treat the condition.

What makes the neuro-ophthalmologist unique is the global viewpoint of the integration and interaction of complex and systemic disorders on visual function. There is no “routine day” for us in neuro-ophthalmology clinic as there is always an interesting patient from which we can learn. Any day can hold a combination of corneal, retinal, optic nerve, rheumatologic, neurologic, infectious, or neurosurgical variety."}}

==Historical Developments==
At the turn of the 20th Century, there was no textbook in the English language on neuro-ophthalmology.  In 1906, Dr. William Campbell Posey, Professor of Ophthalmology in the Philadelphia Polyclinic and Dr. William G. Spiller, Professor of Neurology in the University of Pennsylvania, edited ''The Eye and Nervous System:  Their Diagnostic Relations By Various Authors'' [[J.B. Lippincott &amp; Co.]].  According to the Preface to this book, "Although it is generally conceded that a knowledge of neurology is indispensable to the ophthalmologist and that an acquaintanceship with ophthalmology is of the greatest service to the neurologist, there is no book in the English language which covers the ground where the two specialties meet."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Posey|first=William Campbell|last2=Spiller|first2=William G.|title=The Eye and Nervous System: Their Diagnostic Relations by Various Authors|location=Philadelphia and London|publisher=J.B. Lippincott Company|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank B. Walsh]] was a pioneer of neuro-ophthalmology, helping to popularize and develop the field. Walsh was born in [[Oxbow, Saskatchewan]] in 1895 and earned a degree from University of Manitoba in 1921. He joined the Wilmer Ophthalmological Institute at [[Johns Hopkins University]] and began organizing Saturday morning neuro-ophthalmology conferences. Walsh compiled the first neuro-ophthalmology textbook, which was published in 1947 and has been updated over the years by generations of his students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Angelucci|first1=Diane|title=Groundbreaking neuro-ophthalmologist honored|url=http://www.eyeworld.org/article.php?sid=1115&amp;strict=0&amp;morphologic=0&amp;query=|website=EyeWorld|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Doctors have been decreasing the time spent with a patient due to economic pressures, the use of [[Mid-level practitioner|nonphysicians]], and increasing reliance on [[medical laboratory|laboratory tests]]. Neuro-ophthalmology has been affected more so than other specialties due to the complexity of the patients and the time required to do a neuro-ophthalmic history and physical exam.&lt;ref name= Frohman /&gt; Additionally, the current [[Fee-for-service|medical reimbursement system]] rewards quantity of service (performing assembly line procedures) rather than quality of service (making a correct diagnosis, patient education, and counseling), and seeing complex patients is not adequately recognized.

Improved [[functional neuroimaging]] is paving the way for better understanding, assessment, and management of many neurologic and neuro-ophthalmologic conditions. As our understanding of [[neuroscience]] evolves, neuro-ophthalmologists are becoming increasingly better at treatment, rather than only [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], and novel therapies are emerging to treat traditionally vision-devastating disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newman|first1=SA|title=Interventional neuro-ophthalmology: not an oxymoron.|journal=Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology|date=Jun 2012|volume=32|issue=2|pages=177–84|pmid=22617746|doi=10.1097/wno.0b013e318256638e}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, clinical trials began in February 2014 to use [[gene therapy]] to treat [[Leber hereditary optic neuropathy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lam|first1=BL|last2=Feuer|first2=WJ|last3=Schiffman|first3=JC|last4=Porciatti|first4=V|last5=Vandenbroucke|first5=R|last6=Rosa|first6=PR|last7=Gregori|first7=G|last8=Guy|first8=J|title=Trial end points and natural history in patients with G11778A Leber hereditary optic neuropathy : preparation for gene therapy clinical trial.|journal=JAMA Ophthalmology|date=Apr 1, 2014|volume=132|issue=4|pages=428–36|pmid=24525545|doi=10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2013.7971|pmc=4266137}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is one of the first uses of [[gene therapy]] in the [[central nervous system]]. Progress has also been made in understanding [[retinal ganglion cell]] regeneration and in re-establishing [[synapse|synaptic connections]] from the [[optic nerve]] to the [[brain]],&lt;ref name=Lessell /&gt; more than in other regions of the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watanabe|first1=M|last2=Fukuda|first2=Y|title=Survival and axonal regeneration of retinal ganglion cells in adult cats.|journal=Progress in retinal and eye research|date=Nov 2002|volume=21|issue=6|pages=529–53|pmid=12433376|doi=10.1016/s1350-9462(02)00037-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xia|first1=Y|last2=Nawy|first2=S|last3=Carroll|first3=RC|title=Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in retinal ganglion cells.|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=Nov 7, 2007|volume=27|issue=45|pages=12221–9|pmid=17989288|doi=10.1523/jneurosci.2086-07.2007|pmc=3073613}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the goals of the [[National Institutes of Health]] is to use the [[visual system]] as a window to understand [[neuroplasticity|neural plasticity]] and [[regenerative medicine]] in the [[central nervous system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NEI Audacious Goal Initiative|url=http://www.nei.nih.gov/audacious/|website=National Eye Institute|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an area of [[neuroscience]] that has a promising future and is intimately intertwined with neuro-ophthalmology.

'''Oligosaprobes''' are organisms that inhabit clean water or water that is only slightly polluted by organic matter. [[Oxidation]] processes predominate in such waters owing to an excess of dissolved oxygen. [[Nitrate]]s are among the nitrogen compounds present; there is little carbonic acid and no hydrogen sulfide.  Oligosaprobic environments are aquatic environments rich in dissolved oxygen and (relatively) free from decayed organic matter.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ann Basinger Maggenti, Armand R. Maggenti, and Scott Gardner,  '''Online Dictionary of Invertebrate Zoology: O''' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Oligosaprobes include some green and [[Diatom|diatomaceous algae]], flowering plants (for example, [[European white water lily|European white water lilies]]), some [[rotifers]], [[Bryozoa]], sponges, [[mollusk]]s of the genus [[Dreissena]], [[cladoceran]]s (daphnids, bithotrephes), dragonfly and [[mayfly]] larvae, sterlets, trout, minnows, and newts. Oligosaprobes also embrace a few saprophytes, including bacteria (scores and hundreds per 1 cu mm of water) and organisms that feed on bacteria. The term “oligosaprobe” is usually applied only to freshwater organisms.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition (1970-1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23520">'''Public history''' is a broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of [[history]] who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice is deeply rooted in the areas of [[historic preservation]], [[archival science]], [[oral history]], museum [[curator]]ship, and other related fields.  The field has become increasingly professionalized in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] since the late 1970s.  Some of the most common settings for the practice of public history are [[museums]], historic homes and [[historic site]]s, parks, battlefields, [[archives]],  film and television companies, and all levels of government.

==Definition==
Because it incorporates a wide range of practices and takes place in many different settings, public history proves resistant to being precisely defined.  Four key elements often emerge from the discourse of those who identify themselves as public historians:
* use of the methods of the historical discipline
* an emphasis on the usefulness of historical knowledge in some way that goes beyond purely academic or [[antiquarian]] purposes
* an emphasis on professional training and practice
* an aim to deepen and empower public connection with the past

These elements are expressed in the 1989 mission statement of the U.S.-based [[National Council on Public History]]:  "To promote the utility of history in social through professional practice.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncph.org/Portals/13/About%20the%20Council/NCPHsFirstDecade.pdf Reflections on an Idea: NCPH’s First Decade]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Barbara J. Howe, Chair's Annual Address, The Public Historian, Vol. 11, No. 3 (Summer 1989), pp.&amp;nbsp;69–85&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also present in a definition drafted by the NCPH board in 2007, stating, "Public history is a movement,  methodology, and approach that promotes the collaborative study and practice of history; its practitioners embrace a mission to make their special insights accessible and useful to the public."  However, this draft definition prompted some challenges on the H-Public listserv from people in the field,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ncph.org/WhatisPublicHistory/tabid/282/language/en-US/Default.aspx "Public History Redux"]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Public History News'' (September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; who raised questions about whether public history is solely an endeavor by professional or trained historians, or if [[shared historical authority]] should be a key element of the field. Others have pointed out that the existence of many "publics" for public history complicates the task of definition.  For example, historian [[Peter Novick]] has questioned whether much of what is termed public history should actually be called ''private'' history (for example, the creation of corporate histories or archives) or ''popular'' history (for example, research or exhibits conducted outside the norms of the historical discipline).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Novick, ''That Noble Dream:  The "Objectivity Question" and the American Historical Profession'' (1988), 510-21&lt;/ref&gt; Cathy Stanton has also identified a more radical element in North American public history but has asked: 'how much room is there for the progressive component in the public history movement?'&lt;ref&gt;Cathy Stanton, '' The Lowell Experiment: Public History in a Postindustrial City'' (U. of Massachusetts Press, 2006), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hilda Kean]] and Paul Ashton have also discussed the differences in public history in Britain, Australia, New Zealand and the U.S., arguing against 'a rigid demarcation between "historians" and "their publics"'.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Ashton and Hilda Kean (eds), ''People and their Pasts: Public History Today'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 survey of almost 4,000 practitioners predominantly in the U.S. showed that a substantial proportion (almost one quarter of respondents) expressed some reservations about the term and whether it applied to their own work.&lt;ref&gt;John Dichtl and Robert B. Townsend, [http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2009/0909/0909pub1.cfm "A Picture of Public History]:  Preliminary Results from the 2008 Survey of Public History Professionals" in ''Public History News'', Vol. 29, No. 4 (September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, those who embrace the term ''public historian'' accept that the boundaries of the field are flexible. Its definition remains a work in progress, subject to continual re-evaluation of practitioners' relationships with different audiences, goals, and political, economic, or cultural settings.

==Related fields==

Public history refers to a wide variety of professional and academic fields.&lt;ref&gt;[https://public-history-weekly.degruyter.com/3-2015-2/public-history-sublation-german-debate/ Marko Demantowsky, ''“Public History” – Sublation of a German Debate?'', Public History Weekly, volume 3, number 2, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these include:
* [[Applied history]]
* [[Archival science]]
* [[Cultural Heritage Management]]
* [[Digital History]]
* [[Heritage Interpretation]]
* [[Historic Preservation]]
* [[Historical archaeology]]
* [[Museology]]
* [[Oral History]]
* [[Public humanities]]

In addition, a sub-field of scholarly study has developed over the past several decades which focuses on the history and theory of collective memory and history-making.  This body of scholarship (typified by the winners of the National Council on Public History Book Award) may also be considered to be "public history."

==History==

Public history has many antecedents.  These include [[Museum#History museums|history museums]],  [[Historical society|historical societies]],  public and private [[archive]]s and collections, hereditary and memorial associations, [[Historic preservation|preservation organizations]], historical and heritage projects and offices within government agencies, and depictions of history in popular culture of all kinds (for example, [[historical fiction]]).  Ludmilla Jordanova has also observed that 'the state... lies at the heart of public history', linking public history to the rise of the nation state.&lt;ref&gt;Ludmilla Jordanova, ''The Practice of History'' (London: Edward Arnold, 2003) p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; (English Theologian William Paley declared in 1794 that 'public history' was a 'register of the successes and disappointments... and the quarrels of those who engage in contentions [for] power'.)&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, ''Public History Review'', vol 10, 2003, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a distinct historical discipline formed within Western universities, and this had the effect of gradually separating scholars who practiced history professionally from amateur or public practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Tyrrell, ''Historians in Public:  the Practice of American History, 1890-1970'' (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press, 2005), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;  While there continued to be trained historians working in public settings, there was a general retreat from public engagement among professional historians by the middle decades of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Conard, ''Benjamin Shambaugh and the Intellectual Foundations of Public History'' (Iowa City:  University of Iowa Press, 2002), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, a number of political, economic, social, and historiographical developments worked to reverse this trend, converging to produce a new field that explicitly identified itself as “public history”. The social justice movements of the 1960s and 1970s had sparked an interest in the histories of non-dominant people and groups—for example, women, working-class people, ethnic and racial minorities—rather than the  [[Great man theory|“great men”]] who had traditionally been the focus of many historical narratives. In Britain, this emerged through the History Workshop Movement. Many historians embraced [[social history]] as a subject, and some were eager to become involved in public projects as a way of using their scholarship in activist or public-oriented ways.&lt;ref&gt;James Green, ''Taking History to Heart:  The Power of the Past in Building Social Movements'' (Amherst, Massachusetts:  [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2000), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  In the U.S., a severe shortage of academic jobs for historians led many to consider careers outside the academy.&lt;ref&gt;Novick, ''That Noble Dream'', p. 512&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, publicly funded efforts were underway in many Western countries, ranging from national celebrations like the [[United States Bicentennial]] to multiculturalist projects in [[Multiculturalism in Australia|Australia]] and [[Multiculturalism in Canada|Canada]], paralleled by widespread public interest in [[genealogy]], the tracing of folk and family [[Roots revival|“roots”]], and other history-related activities. In the wake of [[deindustrialization]] in many industrial places, governments also supported [[Urban renewal|regeneration or revitalization projects]] that increasingly included the use of local history and culture as an attraction or a basis for [[place branding|“re-branding”]] a depressed area.&lt;ref&gt;Bella Dicks, ''Culture on Display:  The Production of Contemporary Visitability'' (Maidenhead, UK:  Open University Press, 2003), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;  Out of necessity, inclination, or both, a growing number of people with graduate training in history found employment in these kinds of non-academic settings. Public policy decisions like the passage of the U.S. [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966]] and the Canadian government's addition of “historical researcher” as a civil service category in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;John R. English, "The Tradition of Public History in Canada," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 5, No. 1 (Winter 1983), pp. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt; along with the rise of [[cultural tourism]] and the increasing professionalization of many museums and historical societies, have spurred the growth of the field.

In the U.S., the birth of the public history field can be traced to the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], where Robert Kelley, a member of the history faculty, obtained a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] grant in 1976 to create a graduate program to train young historians for public and private sector careers.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wesley Johnson, "The Origins of ''The Public Historian'' and the National Council on Public History," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 21, No. 3 (Summer 1999), pp. 167-79&lt;/ref&gt;  Kelley drew on his own extensive experience as a consultant and legal witness in water litigation cases in conceiving the idea of “public history” as a field in its own right.  Conferences in Scottsdale, Arizona in 1978 and Montecito, California in 1979 helped to catalyze the new field.  The launch of a professional journal, ''[[The Public Historian]]'', in 1978, and the founding of the [[National Council on Public History]] in 1979 further served to give public-minded historians in the academy and isolated practitioners outside of it a sense that they shared a set of missions, experiences, and methods.

Public history in Canada has followed a similar trajectory in many ways, including the experience of an academic “jobs crisis” in the 1970s and the importance of government as a source of employment for public historians.&lt;ref&gt;English, "Tradition of Public History in Canada"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the University of Waterloo created a Masters program in Public History (now defunct), followed by The University of Western Ontario in 1986, and Carleton University in 2002. Also as in the U.S., Canadian public funding for history and heritage projects has shrunk in the past two decades, with public historians increasingly accountable to funders for the effectiveness of their work.&lt;ref&gt;Lyle Dick, "Public History in Canada:  An Introduction," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 31, No. 1 (February 2009), pp. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;  Public history also exists as an identifiable field in Australia&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann Curthoys]] and Paula Hamilton, “What Makes History Public?” ''Public History Review'' 1992, pp. 8-13&lt;/ref&gt; and to a lesser extent in Europe&lt;ref&gt;Jill Liddington, "What is Public History?  Publics and Their Pasts, Meanings and Practices," ''Oral History'' (Spring 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony R. Sutcliffe, "Gleams and Echoes of Public History in Western Europe:  Before and After the Rotterdam Conference," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 6, No. 4 (Fall 1984), pp. 7-16&lt;/ref&gt; and other places. In Latin America, public history finds its highest expression in Brazil, where public history is closely connected with social history and oral history. The Brazilian Public History Network, created in 2012, has been responsible for promoting publications and sponsoring events of national and international scope aimed to foster a creative and cosmopolitan dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazilian Public History Network|url=http://www.historiapublica.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As in the U.S. and Canada, there are many public projects involving historians and the interpretation of history that do not necessarily claim the specific label “public history.”  The International Federation for Public History,(IFPH-FIHP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ifph.hypotheses.org International Federation for Public History - Fédération Internationale pour l'Histoire Publique]&lt;/ref&gt; was formed in 2010 and became an international association with elected Steering Committee in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncph.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/PHN-2012-September1.pdf Serge Noiret: Next Steps for the International Federation, Public History News, Volume 32, Number 4, September 2012, p.10]&lt;/ref&gt; IFPH is also a permanent &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cish.org/EN/membres/internal-commissions.html#public Internal Commission for the International Committee of Historical Sciences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923203723/http://www.cish.org/EN/membres/internal-commissions.html |date=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal Commission of the International Committee of Historical Sciences (ICHS-CISH). The IFPH seeks to broaden international exchanges about the practice and teaching of public history and it is one of the constitutive co-operation partners of the journal ''[[Public History Weekly]]''.

Public history continues to develop and define itself.  There are currently many graduate and undergraduate public history programs in the U.S., Canada, and other countries (see list and links below). The field has a natural synergy with [[digital history]], with its emphasis on access and broad participation in the creation of historical knowledge.  In recent years there has been a growing body of public historical scholarship, including works recognized by the annual [http://ncph.org/cms/?page_id=105 NCPH Book Award].  In several countries, studies have been conducted to explore how people understand and engage with the past, deepening public historians’ sense of how their own work can best connect with their audiences.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of these, see Margaret Conrad, Jocelyn Létourneau, and David Northrup, "Canadians and Their Pasts:  An Exploration in Historical Consciousness," ''The Public Historian'' Vol. 31, No. 1 (February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  While high-profile “history wars” have taken place over public exhibits and interpretations of history in many places in recent years (for example, [[History wars|Australia's]] ongoing debate over the history of colonisation and indigenous peoples,  the furor over [[Jack Granatstein]]’s 1998 book “Who Killed Canadian History?”, or the 1994 controversy over the [[National Museum of American History]]'s planned exhibit on the [[Enola Gay#Recent developments|Enola Gay]] bomber), public historians tend to welcome these as opportunities to participate in vigorous public discussions over the meanings of the past, debating how people arrive at those meanings.

An evolving form of locally collected and publicly presented history, seen in projects like [[If This House Could Talk]] are a less critical and validated public presentation of history, yet offer engagement at the grass roots level that may encourage new forms of collecting history about the everyday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/forum/library/public-articles/iif-this-house-could.html  |title= Connecting Neighbors through their buildings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

The '''respective case''' (also called the '''dedative''' or '''relative''') is a [[grammatical case]] invented by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in his [[constructed language]] [[Quenya]] (the [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|elven language]] of the book ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''). It is not clear if this case is used with [[preposition]]s, [[transitive verb|transitive]] or [[intransitive verb]]s, or has a more general use. Based on a few examples, one linguist has deduced the possibility that it is used as a kind of [[locative]] (e.g.: ''i coa i taures / i coa i tauressë'' the house in the forest).&lt;ref name="hf7"&gt;Helge Fauskanger, "[http://ardalambion.immaginario.net/ardalambion/quenya.htm#Heading7 'Quenya: L’antica lingua]'', “I sostantivi”, Gianluca Comastri, Italian trans., Ardalambion. Accessed 16 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible use is to translate expressions with the preposition “about.” For example, in translating “He told me about the invasion,” the Quenya word for “invasion” might appear in the respective/dedative. The seeming absence of any other case being used to translate this preposition lends support to this conjecture. In the constructed language [[Ithkuil]] the case corresponding to the preposition about is called '''Referential case'''&lt;ref name="Ithkuil-cases"&gt;[http://ithkuil.net/04_case.html A Grammar of Ithkuil Chapter 4: Case Morphology]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cover of 'Revue et Gazette musicale de Paris' 1835 vol2 n46 - Internet Archive.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Revue et Gazette Musicale de Paris'' (15 November 1835)]]

The '''''{{Lang|fr|Revue musicale}}''''' was a weekly musical review founded in 1827 by the Belgian [[musicologist]], teacher and composer [[François-Joseph Fétis]], then working as professor of [[counterpoint]] and [[fugue]] at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]]. It was the first French-language journal dedicated entirely to classical music. In November 1835 it merged with [[Maurice Schlesinger]]'s '''''Gazette musicale de Paris''''' (first published in January 1834) to form '''''Revue et gazette musicale de Paris''''', first published on 1 November 1835. It ceased publication in 1880.

==History==
By 1830 the '''''Revue musicale''''', written and published by Fétis, was on sale at [[Maurice Schlesinger]]'s music seller's premises.&lt;ref name="RF_13-14"&gt;Vol 7 (Tome VIII, IV&lt;sup&gt;me&lt;/sup&gt; année) (1830) sold by Fétis, Alexandre Mesnier &amp; Schlesinger. See review of Vol. 7 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=WtsnAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA281 ''Revue française'', Issues 13-14, p. 281-3].&lt;/ref&gt; Schlesinger (whose father founded the ''Berliner allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'') was a German music editor who had moved to Paris in 1821. Schlesinger published editions of classical and modern music under his own name at a reasonable price, most notably works by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]] and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]. He also published ''[[Robert le diable]]''&lt;ref&gt;Full score of Schlesinger's edition of [http://imslp.org/wiki/Robert_le_diable_%28Meyerbeer,_Giacomo%29 Robert le diable] at IMSLP.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' by [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], as well as ''[[La Juive]]'' by [[Fromental Halévy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} ''{{Lang|fr|Larousse encyclopédique}}'' vol. 9, p.&amp;nbsp;9405.&lt;/ref&gt; Schlesinger founded his own rival publication, the '''''Gazette Musicale de Paris''''', which first appeared on 5 January 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} {{cite book |title=Gazette Musicale de Paris |volume=I&lt;sup&gt;re&lt;/sup&gt; année, No. 1 |date=5 January 1834 |others= [[Maurice Schlesinger|Schlesinger, Maurice]] (ed.) |url=https://archive.org/stream/gazettemusicaled18341pari#page/n5/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} ''{{Lang|fr|Dictionnaire de la musique}}'' Larousse, p.&amp;nbsp;286 {{ISBN|978-2-03-505545-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another music journal, ''[[Le Ménestrel]]'', had first appeared the previous month on 1 December 1833.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref={{harvid|Le Ménestrel|1883-4|}} |title=Le Ménestrel |date=1 December 1833 |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5619191p/f8 |issue=Année 1, No. 0 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |authorlink=Théophile Gautier |last=Gautier |first=Théophile |year=1995 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QHd3nF0cAbEC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=Le+M%C3%A9nestrel+%22L'Henry%22&amp;hl=en#v=snippet&amp;q=L'Henry&amp;f=false |title=Correspondance générale 1865–1867 |editor1-first= Claudine |editor1-last=Lacoste-Veysseyre |publisher=Librairie Droz |isbn=2-600-00075-5 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until ''La Revue et Gazette'' ceased publication in 1880, ''Le Ménestrel'' was to be its main rival in terms of influence and breadth of coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Ellis |first= Katharine |year=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LC3WSReyLQC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=%22Le+M%C3%A9nestrel%22+Heugel&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Le%20M%C3%A9nestrel%22%20Heugel |title=Music Criticism in Nineteenth-Century France |page=2 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-03589-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1835, Schlesinger bought the ''Revue musicale'' from Fétis and merged the two journals into the '''''Revue et gazette musicale de Paris'''''. He widened the subject matter of the ''{{Lang|fr|Gazette musicale}}'' from music itself to also include literature about music – in 1837 he commissioned from [[Honoré de Balzac]] for the ''Gazette'' the [[novella]] ''[[Gambara (short story)|Gambara]]'' (dealing with the new style of [[grand opera]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} René Guise, ''La Pléiade'', p.&amp;nbsp;1517. Pierre Brunel, "{{Lang|fr|Histoire du texte}}", ''Folio Classique'', 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;318–9 comprising ''Gambara'', ''[[Sarrasine]]'', ''[[Massimilla Doni]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Revue musicale'' returned for six months in 1839 as the '''''Revue musicale, journal des artistes, des amateurs et des théatres''''' while the journal was a bi-weekly publication. The list of contributors to the ''Revue et gazette musicale'' in 1840 included: [[François Benoist]], [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Castil-Blaze]], [[Antoine Elwart]], [[Stephen Heller]], [[Jules Janin]], [[Jean-Georges Kastner]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Édouard Monnais]] (director of the [[Paris Opera]] from 1839 to 1847), [[Joseph d'Ortigue]], [[Theodor Panofka]], [[Ludwig Rellstab]], [[Georges Sand]], [[Robert Schumann]], and one [[Richard Wagner]].

'''Ruth Deborah Gates''' (March 28, 1962 – October 25, 2018) was the Director of the [[Hawaiʻi Institute of Marine Biology]] and the first woman to be President of the [[International Society for Reef Studies]]. Her research was dedicated to understanding [[coral reef]] ecosystems, specifically coral-algal symbiosis and the capacity for corals to acclimatize under future [[climate change]] conditions.&lt;ref name=gs&gt;{{Google scholar id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Gates was inspired by the documentary ''[[The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/18/a-radical-attempt-to-save-the-reefs-and-forests|title=A Radical Attempt to Save the Reefs and Forests|work=The New Yorker|last=Kolbert|first=Elizabeth|date=2016-04-18|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied biology at [[Newcastle University]] where she earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in 1984.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gatescorallab.com/ruth-gates|title=Ruth Gates|website=gatescorallab.com|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; She fell in love with corals during a diving trip to the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hawaiibusiness.com/20-for-the-next-20-2016/|title=20 for the Next 20: 2016|date=2016-03-03|work=Hawaii Business Magazine|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 she moved to the [[West Indies]] to study corals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She completed her [[PhD]] at [[Newcastle University]] in 1989 on seawater temperature and [[algal]]-[[cnidaria]]n [[symbiosis]].&lt;ref name=gatesphd&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Newcastle upon Tyne|url=https://copac.jisc.ac.uk/id/18918380?style=html|title=Seawater temperature and algal-cnidarian symbiosis|first= Ruth Deborah|last=Gates|date=1989|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.346445}}|website=jisc.ac.uk|oclc=557254204}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career and research==
After her PhD, Gates was appointed a [[postdoctoral researcher]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She spent thirteen years working as a junior researcher in California. She was there during the 1998 [[bleaching event]] that killed more than 15 % of corals across the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Gates joined the [[Hawaiʻi Institute of Marine Biology]] 2003.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tetiaroasociety.org/ruth-gates|title=Ruth Gates {{!}} Tetiaroa Society|website=www.tetiaroasociety.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied corals and reefs, learning how they function and working on ways to slow their decline.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She worked on [[Coconut Island]], trying to identify why some corals survive bleaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/03/corals-ocean-temperature/|title=Some Corals May Adapt to Warming Seas|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her group monitored the ecosystems of coral reefs to understand how a changing environment impacted coral health.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gatescorallab.com/monitoring-reefs|title=Monitoring Reefs|website=gatescorallab.com|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corals in shallow patches like [[Kāneʻohe Bay]] are subject to high temperatures and irradiance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Alongside seawater temperature, they measure photosynthetic active radiation, salinity and nutrient composition.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This allowed them to build [[3D modeling|3D models]] of reefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TheJohnburns84|title=Ke'ei|date=2015-10-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxZLu7wByKY&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They study the [[symbiodinium]] that live within coral tissues.

A '''sliding door operator''' (or '''sliding door opener''' or '''automatic sliding door operator''') is a device that operates a [[sliding door]] for pedestrian use. It opens the door automatically, waits, then closes it.
[[File:Oorlogsmuseum Overloon.JPG|thumb|Sliding door with opener in a museum]]

== Uses ==
Sliding door operators are typically used on the outside doors of large retail businesses. (smaller retail businesses prefer [[swing door operator]]s.)
They are also used in [[elevator|elevators (lifts)]]

== Triggering ==
A door operator may be triggered in various ways:
* Approach Sensor (such as a [[radar sensor]]) - the door opens when a user approaches it.
* Pushbutton - the door opens when a user presses a button.
* Access control - the door opens when an [[Access control|Access Control System]] determines the user is authorized to go through.
* Automatically (in the case of elevators)
A trigger from any of the above requests that the door be opened (or reopened if it was closing).

== Safety sensors ==
Sensors can be used to detect obstacles in the path of closing doors. The simplest sensor consists of a light beam aimed across the opening: when the beam is broken by an obstacle, the operator prevents the door from closing. [[Infrared]] and [[radar]] safety sensors are also commonly used.

Other sensors such as resistance-sensing motors can be used to reverse the closing action of the door after an obstacle is encountered.

==Technology==
The operator is placed in the space above the sliding door. 

An [[electric motor]], geared down to get a lower speed and a higher [[torque]], drives a [[pulley]] at one end of a belt. The door is clamped to the belt. To open the door, the motor turns the pulley, which in turn turns the belt, which in turn drags the door. To close the door, the reverse occurs.

Historically, elevator doors were opened by a set of mechanical linkages; the motor, geared down, would rotate linked arms, which in turn would drive the door.

==Types==
There are several types of sliding doors, these are:

* Standard sliding door (single wing or double wings)
* Telescopic sliding door (two wings or four wings) 
* Circular sliding door (segment circular, semi-circular or full circular)
* Sliding folding door (two wings or four wings)
* Hermetic sliding door (single wing or double wings)
* All glass sliding door (single wing or double wings)
* [[Clean room]] sliding door (single wing or double wings)

The '''Société Chimique de France''' ('''SCF''') is a [[learned society]] and [[professional association]] founded in 1857 to represent the interests of French chemists in a variety of ways in local, national and international contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Société Chimique de France (SCF), [http://www.societechimiquedefrance.fr/fr/missions-de-la-scf.html   Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409094637/http://www.societechimiquedefrance.fr/fr/missions-de-la-scf.html |date=2010-04-09 }}; retrieved 2011-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt;  Until 2009 the organization was known as the '''Société Française de Chimie'''.

==History==
The Society traces its origins back to an organization of young Parisian chemists who began meeting in May 1857 under the name Société Chimique, with the goal of self-study and mutual education.  In 1858 the established chemist [[Adolphe Wurtz]] joined the society, and immediately transformed it into a [[learned society]] modeled after the [[Chemical Society]] of London, which was the precursor of the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]. Like its British counterpart, the French association sought to foster the communication of new ideas and facts throughout France and across international borders.&lt;ref name="Lagowski1991"&gt;Lagowski, J. J. (1991). [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/ed068p1  "A British Sesquicentennial,"] ''Journal of Chemical Education,'' Vol 68, No. 1, p. 1; acknowledging the sesquicentennial of The Chemical Society in London, which eventually became the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]; retrieved 2011-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Support for the ''[[Bulletin de la Société Chimique de France|Bulletin de la Société Chimique de Paris]]'' began in 1858.   

In the 21st century, the society has become a member of [[ChemPubSoc Europ]]e, which is an organization of 16 European chemical societies.  This European consortium was established in the late 1990s as many chemical journals owned by national chemical societies were amalgamated.&lt;ref&gt;ChemPubSoc Europe, [http://www.wiley-vch.de/vch/journals/2111/chempubsoc-eu.html mission]; [http://www.wiley-vch.de/vch/journals/2111/chempubsoc-eu_members.html  participating societies]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 they started [[ChemistryViews]].org, their news and information service for chemists and other scientists worldwide.

===Prizes and awards===
The society acknowledges individual achievement with prizes and awards, including:
* Louis Ancel Prize
* Raymond Berr Prize

'''''The Last Heathen: Encounters with Ghosts and Ancestors in Melanesia''''' is a book by [[Charles Montgomery (writer)|Charles Montgomery]], published in Canada by [[Douglas and McIntyre]] in 2004. In 2006 it was published in the United States by [[HarperCollins]] as ''The Shark God''.

''The Last Heathen'' is the autobiographical account of the author in his journey to [[Melanesia]], following in the footsteps of his great-grandfather, [[Henry Montgomery (bishop)|Henry Montgomery]], [[Bishop of Tasmania]], and to study the effect of his great-grandfather's religion on the people. Montgomery traveled to Melanesia expecting to find a volatile mixture of the tribal, pagan religion and Christianity. He found a comfortable hybrid instead, the two religions living in harmony. The book details his journey as well as his discoveries, from an atheistic point of view.

The book won the [[Charles Taylor Prize]] for Literary Non-fiction in 2005. The book has also won the [[Hubert Evans Non-Fiction Prize]].

'''''The Principles of Exercise Therapy''''' is a 1953 book by M. Dena Gardiner. 

==About the book==
The Principles of Exercise Therapy book is explained in detailed about exercises. Physical training is physical activity that improves physical condition and health. Physical training protects the health of a person and regulates the patient's health. Physical training mechanics plays a major medicine. Walking, running, swimming, ice skating, bicycling, playing, dance, yoga, and physical exercise are all physical exercises. Heart disease, diabetes and obesity can be controlled by exercise. The book also alleges that exercise helps to reduce mental retardation and reduce the risk of mental retardation in the exercise. It is essential to exercise immune organs or adequate vascular organs in a coherent blood circulation.

==Reception==
The ''[[British Journal of Occupational Therapy]]'' reviewed the book in 1954, stating that "Miss Gardiner is to be congratulated on an excellent piece of work which should prove invaluable to all engaged in the rehabilitation of the physically unfit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=January 1, 1954|title=Book Review: The Principles of Exercise Therapy|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/030802265401700109|journal=British Journal of Occupational Therapy|volume=17|issue=1|pages=16-17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Physical Therapy (journal)|Physical Therapy]]'' also reviewed the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=December 1, 1954|title=The Principles of Exercise Therapy|url=https://academic.oup.com/ptj/article-abstract/34/12/649/4669090?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Physical Therapy|volume=34|issue=12|pages=649|doi=10.1093/ptj/34.12.649|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4941">A '''vector-based graphical user interface''' is a mostly conceptual type of [[graphical user interface]] where elements are drawn using [[Vector graphics|vector]] rather than [[Raster graphics|raster]] information.

[[Image:3D GUI.png|thumb|200px|An example of a vector-based window, found in a privately funded vector-based graphical user interface research project.]]

[[File:2D Vector GUI.png|thumb|2D GUI. All window decorations and elements inside them are vector-based, the background is generated from multiple sine waves and the shapes are defined in-runtime. The final image is rasterized, anti-aliased and optionally composited, here the compositing is disabled.]]

==Pros and cons==
The benefits of a completely vector-based graphical user interface would include:
:*more efficient, independent scalability; The resolution (measured in [[dots per inch]] or DPI) could be set higher or lower than 1px:1px without causing [[pixelation]], enabling better use of high resolution monitors.

Cons might include:
:*Difficulty integrating raster-based applications. With some effort, this could be accomplished by texturing the entire raster-based application to a vector-based plane (though the disadvantages of raster-based graphics would still stand).
:*Slower rendering, greater system requirements. Because today's monitors display only raster-based information, the vector information would have to be rasterized (and optionally [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliased]]) before appearing.

==Usage in 3D graphical user interfaces==
Since current [[3D computer graphics|3D Graphics]] are usually vector-based, rather than raster-based, vector-based graphical user interfaces would be suitable for 3D graphical user interfaces. This is because raster-based 3D models take up an enormous amount of memory, as they are stored and displayed using [[voxel]]s. Current [[operating systems]] such as [[Windows Vista]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[UNIX|UNIX-based]] operating systems (including [[Linux]]) have enjoyed much benefit from using 3D graphical user interfaces. In Windows Vista, for example, [[Windows Aero|Flip3D]] textures each window to a 3D plane based on vector graphics. Even though the window itself is still raster-based, the plane onto which it is textured is vector-based. As a result, the windows, when rotated, appear flat. In Linux desktops, [[Compiz Fusion]] can texture each raster-based workspace onto a 3D vector-based cube.  As operating systems evolve, eventually the entire window would be made from 3D vector graphics, so that when rotated, it does not appear "flat". Also, advanced lighting may make 3D graphical user interfaces more aesthetically pleasing.

==Usage in 2D graphical user interfaces==
As most computer monitors become more and more [[dots per inch|high resolution]], everything displayed would be smaller. However, if the screen resolution were turned down, everything would appear pixelated. Thus, [[resolution independence]] is currently being designed to solve this problem. With raster graphics, all icons need to be extremely high resolution, so as to not appear pixelated on higher resolution screens. This may take up enormous amounts of memory, and hard disk space.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} If vector graphics were used instead, it could be easily scalable and never lose data nor appear pixelated.

Some Graphical User Interfaces on [[Operating System]]s such as [[IRIX]] use vector-based icons.  A number of vector-based icon sets are also available for window managers such as [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]].

With Windows, applications built using [[Windows Presentation Foundation]] (which is native{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} to [[Windows Vista]], but can be downloaded for [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003|Server 2003]]) are vector-based and scale losslessly based on Windows [[Dots per inch|DPI]] settings.  However, even without this, it has always been possible to build applications to be DPI-aware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms969894.aspx MSDN: How to Write High-DPI Applications]&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, in Vista, the [[Desktop Window Manager]] detects when an app is not DPI aware and, if the computer is set to a different DPI than normal, uses bitmap scaling to render the window at a larger size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/greg_schechter/archive/2006/08/07/690704.aspx High DPI Support in Windows Vista Aero]&lt;/ref&gt;

New version of [[AmigaOS]] 4.1 enhanced in 2008 its [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] with 2D vector graphical interface based on [[Cairo (Graphics)|Cairo]] libraries, but pragmatically integrated it with a 3D Compositing Engine based on [[Alpha Channel|Porter-Duff]] Routines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3253">A '''vector addition system (VAS)'''  is one of several mathematical modeling languages for the description of distributed systems. Vector addition systems were introduced by [[Richard M. Karp]] and Raymond E. Miller in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karp|first1=Richard M.|last2=Miller|first2=Raymond E.|title=Parallel program schemata|journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences|date=May 1969|volume=3|issue=2|pages=147–195|doi=10.1016/S0022-0000(69)80011-5|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0022-0000(69)80011-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generalized to '''vector addition systems with states (VASS)''' by [[John Hopcroft|John E. Hopcroft]] and Jean-Jacques Pansiot in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopcroft|first1=John E.|last2=Pansiot|first2=Jean-Jacques|title=On the reachability problem for 5-dimensional vector addition systems|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|date=1979|volume=8|issue=2|pages=135–159|doi=10.1016/0304-3975(79)90041-0|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3975(79)90041-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both VAS and VASS are equivalent in many ways to [[Petri net]]s introduced earlier by [[Carl Adam Petri]]. [[File:Vector addition with states.svg|thumb|Example of a vector addition with states. In this VASS, e.g., q(1,2) can be reached from p(0,0), but q(0,0) cannot be reached from p(0,0).]]

== Informal definition ==

A ''vector addition system'' consists of a finite set of [[integer]] [[row vector|vectors]]. An initial vector is seen as the initial values of multiple counters, and the vectors of the VAS are seen as updates. These counters may never drop below zero. More precisely, given an initial vector with non negative values, the vectors of the VAS can be added componentwise, given that every intermediate vector has non negative values. A ''vector addition system with states'' is a VAS equipped with control states. More precisely, it  is a finite [[directed graph]] with [[Directed graph#Basic terminology|arcs]] labelled by [[integer]] vectors. VASS have the same restriction that the counter values should never drop below zero.

== Formal definitions and basic terminology ==

* A ''VAS'' is a finite set &lt;math&gt;V \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;d &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* A ''VASS'' is a finite [[directed graph]] &lt;math&gt;(Q, T)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;T \subseteq Q \times \mathbb{Z}^d \times Q&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;d &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Transitions ===

* Let &lt;math&gt;V \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d&lt;/math&gt; be a VAS. Given a vector &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathbb{N}^d&lt;/math&gt;, the vector &lt;math&gt;u + v&lt;/math&gt; can be ''reached'', in one transition, if &lt;math&gt;v \in V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u + v \in \mathbb{N}^d&lt;/math&gt;.
* Let &lt;math&gt;(Q, T)&lt;/math&gt; be a VASS. Given a ''configuration'' &lt;math&gt;(p, u) \in Q \times \mathbb{N}^d&lt;/math&gt;, the configuration &lt;math&gt;(q, u + v)&lt;/math&gt; can be ''reached'', in one transition, if &lt;math&gt;(p, v, q) \in T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u + v \in \mathbb{N}^d&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences''' ('''WCGS''') (formerly known as the Cornell University Graduate School of Medical Sciences) is a [[graduate school|graduate]] college of [[Cornell University]] that was founded in 1952 as an academic partnership between two major medical institutions in [[New York City]]: the [[Weill Cornell Medical College]] and the [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center|Sloan Kettering Institute]].  Cornell is involved in the [[Tri-Institutional MD-PhD Program]] with [[Rockefeller University]] and the [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center|Sloan Kettering Institute]]; each of these three institutions is part of a large biomedical center extending along York Avenue between 65th and 72nd Streets on the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]].

==Programs of study==
Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences (WCGS) partners with neighboring institutions along York Avenue, also known as the “corridor of science” in New York City. Such partnerships with [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center]], [[NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital|New York-Presbyterian Hospital]], the [[Hospital for Special Surgery]] and [[Rockefeller University|The Rockefeller University]] offer learning.

WCGS offers a variety of programs at both the Masters and Doctoral levels.

'''Zero population growth''', sometimes abbreviated '''ZPG''' (also called the [[Total fertility rate#Replacement rates|replacement level of fertility]]),&lt;ref name="Ref_"&gt;Zero Population Growth Organizanion. "Zero Population Growth." BookRags Staff. N.p., 2005. Web. 7 Oct. 2009. &lt;http://www.bookrags.com/research/zero-population-growth-enve-02/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is a condition of [[demographic]] balance where the number of people in a specified population neither [[Population growth|grows]] nor [[Population decline|declines]], considered as a social aim by some.&lt;ref name="Ref_a"&gt;Kingsley Davis (1973) "Zero population growth: the goal and the means" in ''The No-Growth Society'', Mancur Olson &amp; Hans H. Landsberg, eds. New York: Norton&lt;/ref&gt;
According to some, zero population growth, perhaps after stabilizing at some [[optimum population]], is the ideal towards which countries and the whole world should aspire in the interests of accomplishing long-term environmental [[sustainability]].&lt;ref name="Ref_b"&gt;Last, John M. "Zero Population Growth." Healthline. N.p., 2002. Web. 5 Oct. 2009. &lt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/zero-population-growth |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 7, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722132220/http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/zero-population-growth |archivedate=July 22, 2011 }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; What it means by ‘the number of people neither grows nor declines’ is that births plus in-migrants equal deaths plus out-migrants.&lt;ref&gt;Haupt, Arthur, and Thomas Kane (1991) "The Population Reference Bureau's Population Handbook", 3d ed. Washington, D.C.: Population Reference Bureau&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A loosely defined goal of ZPG is to match the [[Total fertility rate#Replacement rates|replacement fertility rate]], which is the average number of children per woman which would hold the population constant. This replacement fertility will depend on [[mortality rates]] and the sex ratio at birth, and varies from around 2.1 in developed countries to over 3.0 in some developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Espenshade, Thomas J.; Guzman, Juan Carlos and Westoff, Charles F. [http://www.princeton.edu/~tje/files/global_variation_in_replacement_fertility_prpr_2003.pdf "The Surprising Global Variation in Replacement Fertility"], Population Research and Policy Review, Vol.22, No. 5-6, Dec. 2003, pp. 575-583.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American [[sociology|sociologist]] and [[demography|demographer]] [[Kingsley Davis]] is credited with coining the term&lt;ref name="Davis1967"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davis |first=Kingsley |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1967 |month= |title=Population policy: Will current programs succeed? |journal=Science |volume=158 |issue=3802 |pages=730–739 |doi=10.1126/science.158.3802.730 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=6069101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/97/970305davisobit.html|title=Kingsley Davis, Hoover fellow, demographer, sociologist, dies at age 88 (3/97)|website=www.stanford.edu|accessdate=16 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805130752/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/97/970305davisobit.html|archive-date=5 August 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but it was used earlier by George Stolnitz, who stated that the concept of a [[Demography#Common Rates and Ratios|stationary population]] dated back to 1693.&lt;ref name="Stolnitz1955"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stolnitz |first=George J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1955 |month= |title= A Century of International Mortality Trends_ I|journal=Population Studies |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=24–55 |id= |accessdate= |quote= |doi=10.2307/2172340 |publisher=Population Investigation Committee |jstor=2172340}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A mathematical description was given by [[James Mirrlees]].&lt;ref name="Mirrlees1967"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mirrlees |first=J.

In the late 1960s ZPG became a prominent political movement in the U.S. and parts of Europe, with strong links to [[environmentalism]] and [[feminism]]. [[Yale University]] was a stronghold of the ZPG activists who believed “that a constantly increasing population is responsible for many of our problems: pollution, violence, loss of values and of individual privacy.”&lt;ref&gt;“ZPG – A New Movement Challenges the U.S. to Stop Growing”, [[Life (magazine)|LIFE magazine]], April 27, 1970, page 12ff&lt;/ref&gt; Founding fathers of the movement were [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]], author of ''[[The Population Bomb]]'', Richard Bowers, a Connecticut lawyer, and Professor [[Charles Lee Remington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.populationconnection.org/us/30-years-of-zpg/|title=Whatever happened to Zero Population Growth (ZPG)?|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrlich stated: “The mother of the year should be a sterilized woman with two adopted children.”

==Effects==
In the long term, zero population growth can be achieved when the [[birth rate]] of a population equals the [[death rate]], i.e. fertility is at replacement level and birth and death rates are stable, a condition also called demographic equilibrium. Unstable rates can lead to drastic changes in population levels. This analysis is valid for the planet as a whole (assuming that [[Interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary travel]] remains at zero or negligible levels), but not necessarily for a region or country as it ignores [[human migration|migration]]. A population that has been growing in the past will have a higher proportion of young people.  As it is younger people who have children, there is large time lag between the point at which the fertility rate (mean total number of children each woman has during her childbearing years) falls to the replacement level (the fertility rate which would result in equal birth and death rates for a population at equilibrium) and the point at which the population stops rising.&lt;ref name="Ref_d"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ditext.com/ehrlich/3.html|title=The Population Explosion|website=www.ditext.com|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is that even though the fertility rate has dropped to replacement level, people already within a population continue to live for some time. Therefore, equilibrium, with a static population, will not be reached until the first "replacement level" birth cohorts reach old age and die. The related calculations are complex because the population's overall death rate can vary over time, and mortality also varies with age (being highest among the old).

Conversely, with fertility below replacement, a large elderly generation eventually results (as in an aging “[[baby boom]]”); but since that generation failed to replace itself during its [[fertility|fertile]] years, a subsequent “population bust”, or decrease in population, will occur when the older generation dies off. This effect has been termed [[birth dearth]]. In addition, if a country's fertility is at replacement level, and has been that way for at least several decades (to stabilize its age distribution), then that country's population could still experience coincident growth due to continuously increasing [[life expectancy]], even though the population growth is likely to be smaller than it would be from natural population increase.

Zero population growth is often a goal of demographic planners and [[environmentalist]]s who believe that reducing population growth is essential for the health of the [[ecosystem]]. Preserving cultural traditions and [[ethnic diversity]] is a factor for not allowing human populations levels or rates to fall too low. Achieving ZPG is difficult because a country's population growth is often determined by economic factors, incidence of poverty, natural disasters, disease, etc.

However, even if there is zero population growth, there may be changes in demographics of great [[Demographic gift|importance to economic factors]], such as changes in [[population pyramid|age distribution]].

==How ZPG can be achieved==
Number of demographic experts have suggested a few ways to reach zero population growth.

Biologist Alan D. Thornhill and Author [[Daniel Quinn]] argue that human population growth is a function of the human food supply&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1011463231976#page-1|title = Human Population Numbers as a Function of Food Supply|last = Hoffenberg|first = Ruseell|date = March 2001|journal = Environment, Development and Sustainability|doi = 10.1023/A:1011463231976|pmid = |access-date = 12 December 2015|last2 = Pimentel|publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that human population growth can only be achieved by an expanded food supply to support the growing population. In 1998, they produced a video entitled "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAqWUxCjisE Food Production and Human Population Growth]" where they explain the theory and answer audience questions.

[[Albert Allen Bartlett|Albert Bartlett]], an emeritus professor of physics at University of Colorado at Boulder in his lifetime, suggested that the population have following choices to be at ZPG:

# Voluntarily limit births and immigration to achieve zero population growth;
#Continue on the present path until our population is so large that draconian measures become necessary to stop the growth of population;
#Do nothing and let nature stop the growth through disease, starvation, war and pestilence. If humans do not solve the problem, nature will.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, Albert A. &amp; Lytwak, Edward P. “Zero Growth of the Population of the United States.” (http://www.albartlett.org/articles/ee_zero_growth_population_us_1995.pdf), Population and Environment, Vol.16, Issue 5, May. 1995, pp 415-428&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Jason Brent, another demographic expert, argues that there are three ways to achieve zero population growth. His argument is as follows:

# By war, with or without [[weapons of mass destruction]], [[starvation]], [[disease]], [[rape]], [[murder]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[Internment|concentration camps]], and other horrors beyond the imagination, when humanity has exceeded the [[carrying capacity]] of the Earth.
# By the voluntary action of all of humanity prior to the human population exceeding the carrying capacity of the Earth. If any group or even if a single-family failed to control its population the entire program would fail.
# By coercive population control prior to the human population exceeding the carrying capacity of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Wooldbridge, Frosty (27 Feb 2013). “Zero population growth: only way out of world population overload” (http://churchandstate.org.uk/2013/03/zero-population-growth-only-way-out/).{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Church and State, Retrieved 2015-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In China==
[[China#Demographics|China]] is the largest country by population in the world, being home to some 1.4 billion people. China is expected to witness a zero population growth rate by 2030. China's population growth has slowed since the beginning of this century. This was mostly the result of China's economic growth and increasing living standards which led to the decline. However, many demographers also credit China's [[One-child policy|family planning policy]], which was formulated in the early 1970s, encourages late marriages, late childbearing, and the use of contraceptives, and since 1980 has limited most urban couples to one child and most rural couples to two children. According to government projections, the work-age population will then drop to 870 million.  It was said, in 2009, that the Chinese government was hoping to see zero population growth in the future&lt;ref name="Xiang2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-07/21/content_11746029.htm|title=China expected to see zero population growth by 2030: expert|last=Xiang|first=Zhang|date=21 July 2009|work=China View|accessdate=2010-03-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722071749/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-07/21/content_11746029.htm|archivedate=22 July 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, in November 2013, a relaxation of the one-child policy was announced amid unpopularity, reduced labour pool and support for an ageing population.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-24957303|title=China reforms: One-child policy to be relaxed|date=15 November 2013|work=BBC News|accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
