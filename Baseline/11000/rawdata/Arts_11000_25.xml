'''''Air America''''' is a 1978 [[non-fiction]] book by [[Christopher Robbins]], a journalist investigating [[Allegations of CIA drug trafficking|CIA drug trafficking]] and [[Air America (airline)|front companies]] for ''[[The Observer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Air America|url = https://www.amazon.com/Air-America-Christopher-Robbins/dp/0380899094|publisher = Avon Books|date = 1985-10-01|location = New York|isbn = 9780380899098|language = English|first = Christopher|last = Robbins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book chronicles the [[investigative reporting]] of Robbins from his accidental discovery of the very existence of a company named Air America to the end of the former CIA-owned company, ultimately privatized.

It is the story of one of the world's biggest covert operations: Air America was owned by the CIA, started from the scratch of bunch of other agency-owned air assets. Air America—at its peak—became the biggest civil air fleet in the world.

==Background==
From the 1950s to the early 1970s, Indochina had been the landscape of vast major drug and military operations played by many actors including European and communist countries.  When the US military involvement started, costs rose and new resources, especially for covert operations, were needed.  Since the time of the Anglo-Chinese war, opium was the main source of wealth in the region.  CIA and Air America flew those skies from the times of the [[Korean War]].  A new facility was built inside CIA headquarters in northern Laos where bulk opium was refined into heroin and shipped abroad.  Within a decade of military intervention, in the early seventies, Indochina had become the world's leading opium producer, reaching a 70% worldwide marketshare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Air America|url = http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1104713.Air_America|website = Goodreads|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = 'Air America' Movie Doesn't Say U.S. Fought for Drugs in Laos|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/22/opinion/l-air-america-movie-doesn-t-say-us-fought-for-drugs-in-laos-938390.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1990-09-22|access-date = 2015-10-01|issn = 0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anything, Anywhere, Anytime==
Air America's pilots flew dangerous missions, those no one else would fly, frequently under enemy fire.

Air America's motto was '''"Anything, anywhere, anytime"'''. "Anything" included food, medical supplies, weapons, and drug-related items. The most important precursors required for refining [[raw opium]] into [[heroin]] are [[ether]] and [[acetic anhydride]]. Because of its use for the synthesis of heroin by the diacetylation of morphine, acetic anhydride is today listed as a US DEA List II precursor, and officially restricted in many other countries.

Many missions were in fact aid-oriented missions to provide logistical support and food to allies who were fighting the war along with the South Vietnamese and the US. Most of the time, pilots did not know what they were delivering, just when and where, no matter what the weather was like, or whether it was day or night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CIA Air Operations in Laos, 1955-1974 — Central Intelligence Agency|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/winter99-00/art7.html|website = www.cia.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexandru Bassarab''', or '''Basarab''' (August 7, 1907 – July 8, 1941), was a [[Romania]]n painter, engraver, and [[Fascism|fascist]] politician. Earning his reputation for his pioneering work in [[linocut]] and [[woodcut]], he explored neotraditionalism, [[Romanian nationalism]], and [[Romanian folklore]], and was ultimately drawn into politics with the [[Iron Guard]]. He helped steer several art groups associated or integrated with the Guard, contributed to its fascist propaganda, and briefly served in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]]. He survived the clampdown of the late 1930s, returning to apolitical work with ''Grupul Grafic'', and exploring the legacy of [[Byzantine art]].

Under the [[National Legionary State]], Bassarab returned to favor as one of the leading political iconographers, also urging others to contribute "epic" art in support of the regime. Arrested during the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|civil strife of early 1941]], Bassarab was allowed to redeem himself on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. He died there, in mysterious circumstances, while his work continued to be censored at home.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Bassarab was born in [[Bacău]], where he graduated high school.&lt;ref name="icțiganca"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Iurie Colesnic]], [http://www.timpul.md/articol/iurie-colesnic-in-culisele-istoriei--un-pictor-cazut-la-iganca-54812.html "În culisele Istoriei. Un pictor căzut la Țiganca"], in ''[[Timpul (Moldova)|Timpul]]'', February 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Likely a student of [[Ion Theodorescu-Sion]]'s at the [[Bucharest National University of Arts|National School of Fine Arts]], in subsequent years he attended both the Law Faculty of the [[University of Bucharest]] at the private art school run by Constantin Vlădescu, where his teachers included [[Nicolae Tonitza]], [[Francisc Șirato]] and [[Petre Iorgulescu-Yor]].&lt;ref&gt;Teacă, p.200. See also Clark, p.192&lt;/ref&gt; Bassarab was a specialist in the linocut technique,&lt;ref name="s384"&gt;Scăiceanu, p.384&lt;/ref&gt; also praised for his work in woodcut. He continued to exhibit canvasses at various venues but, as noted at the time by art critic [[Alexandru D. Broșteanu]], these were "timid", far less "rounded" than his woodcuts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandru D. Broșteanu]], "Cronica plastică", in ''[[Gândirea]]'', Nr. 4/1936, p.214-15&lt;/ref&gt; The same was argued by [[Petru Comarnescu]], who suggests that Bassarab "never fully mastered the interplay of colors".&lt;ref name="pcfront"&gt;[[Petru Comarnescu]], "Note. †Al. Basarab", in ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'', Nr. 5/1942, p.467-68&lt;/ref&gt;

Bassarab joined the [[Iron Guard]], a native fascist movement, in 1932, and, as an aspiring propagandist, helped set up its artistic club, named after [[Ștefan Luchian]], and its ''Ideea României'' Lodge.&lt;ref name="icțiganca"/&gt; From October 1934, with [[Ioan Victor Vojen]], [[Dan Botta]], [[Alexandru Ciucurencu]], [[Radu Gyr]], [[Horia Stamatu]], and [[George Zlotescu]], Bassarab was also active in the art collective ''Arta și Omul''. Founded as an apolitical enterprise by Tonitza, it had been taken over by Guardist intellectuals, expressing its rejection of [[liberal democracy]] and its embrace of [[corporatism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ioan Victor Vojen]], "Prefață pentru o activitate viitoare", in ''Arta și Omul'', Nr. 16–17/1934, p.236–38&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, Bassarab's apolitical works were featured at the Official Salons. Although he failed to win prizes there, in 1934 and 1935 the Romanian state purchased a number of his engravings.&lt;ref&gt;"Caleidoscopul vieții intelectuale. Litere, știință, artă. Premiile și cumpărăturile la Salonul Oficial de desen și gravură", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', December 1, 1935, p.2; A. B., "Note și informații", in ''Arta și Omul'', Nr. 16–17/1934, p.264&lt;/ref&gt; With Stamatu, he worked on an edition of [[François Villon]]'s ballads: Stamatu translated them, and Bassarab designed the lettering. Although the work was never printed in book form, it circulated as a rough copy among the intellectuals of [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Octav Șuluțiu]], "Cronica literară: Zoe Verbiceanu, ''Baladele lui François Villon''", in ''[[Gândirea]]'', Nr. 3–4/1941, p.195&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Roland Clark, Bassarab and Zlotescu endure as "[the Guard's] best painters", both of them being guided by Theodorescu-Sion's neotraditionalism; all three were indebted to [[Romanian folklore]], depicting peasants as "active, heroic figures", "dynamic, virile, determined".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p.192–93&lt;/ref&gt; Their art, seen by far-right chroniclers as a "purely Romanian" enterprise, was prominently displayed at the Guard's Bucharest offices, ''Casa Verde'', during a September 1937 exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p.182, 193&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mihail Polihroniade]] used Bassarab's engravings for his propaganda work, ''Tabăra de muncă'', which came out at ''[[Universul]]'' publishers in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p.195&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, Bassarab and Zlotescu also illustrated Neculai Totu's memoir of Guardist participation in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name="craa4857"&gt;"Deciziuni. Comisiunea română pentru aplicarea armistițiului. Comunicat", in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'', Nr. 129/1945, p. 4857&lt;/ref&gt;

Bassarab ran on the Guard lists in the [[Romanian general election, 1937|December 1937 election]]. He took a seat in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]] for [[Ialomița County|Ialomița]], but lost it immediately when [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] ordered a clampdown.&lt;ref name="icțiganca"/&gt; Subsequently, the [[National Renaissance Front]] dictatorship kept Bassarab under close watch, documenting his participation (with Polihroniade, [[Ion Zelea Codreanu]], and Bănică Dobre) in the clandestine Guardist reunion of [[Călărași]] (February 1938).&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Gheorghe, "Activitatea legionarilor dâmbovițeni în timpul monarhiei autoritare carliste (1938–1940)", in ''Collegium Mediense III. Comunicări Științifice, XII: Istorie, Arheologie, Științe Politice'', 2013, p.105&lt;/ref&gt; By early 1940, Bassarab exhibited with the collective known as ''Grupul Grafic'', alongside [[Marcel Olinescu]]. Their work was apolitical, heavily inspired by [[Byzantine art]]—within that context, Bassarab remained the more [[Realism (arts)|naturalistic]], preserving elements of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Petru Comarnescu]], "Note. Grupul Grafic", in ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'', Nr. 2/1940, p.476&lt;/ref&gt; Founders of ''Grupul Grafic'' also included [[Aurel Mărculescu]], who was both [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] and an anti-fascist.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} V. I., [https://web.archive.org/web/20141115103522/http://www.j-art.ro/artist.php?uid=15 ''Aurel Mărculescu/Aron Marcovici (Piatra Neamț, 1900 – București, 1947)''], [http://www.j-art.ro/ J-Art. Artiști Evrei din România] (Center for Monitoring and Combating Antisemitism in Romania &amp; [[Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania]])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political rise, downfall, and death===
In September 1940, Carol abdicated and the Guard took over, establishing a "[[National Legionary State]]"; Bassarab, Olinescu, and [[Gheorghe Ceglokoff]] reformed ''Grupul Grafic'', which was now openly associated with the Guard, and exhibited at [[Sala Dalles]].&lt;ref name="ifgrupul"&gt;[[Ion Frunzetti]], "Grupul Grafic (Sala Dalles)", in ''[[Universul Literar]]'', Nr. 40/1940, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Bassarab exhibited work that was highly political, including portraits of folk heroes such as [[Vasile Ursu Nicola|Horia]] alongside Guard commanders such as [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], [[Ion Moța]] and [[Gheorghe Clime]]. [[Ion Frunzetti]], a Guard supporter and art critic, praised him as "the chronicler of a destiny", with "a certain [[Thracians|Thracian]] toughness".&lt;ref name="ifgrupul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p.193; Teacă, p.200&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed to high positions in the field of propaganda, Bassarab stirred controversy by suggesting that artists should abandon [[easel painting]] in favor of "epic" [[muralism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ion Vlasiu]], "Cronici. Salonul oficial de toamnă", in ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'', Nr. 12/1940, p.663-64&lt;/ref&gt;

During that interval, the Guard accorded its assassinated and exhumed founder, Codreanu, a lavish second funeral. The ceremony was held at [[Sfântul Ilie Gorgani Church]] in Bucharest, and the entrance to the church was flanked by two giant posters of archangels, massively enlarged versions of [[line engraving]]s drawn by Bassarab in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Teacă, p.200-01&lt;/ref&gt; These closely resemble ''Nașterea'' ("Birth"), another drawing by Bassarab. There, the Guard's patron, the [[Archangel Michael]], watches over an infant at his feet. Above, a legend gives Codreanu's birthdate, giving the image a religious and propagandistic impact. Another drawing of his draws upon folklore to place Codreanu in the context of the [[Miorița]] legend.&lt;ref&gt;Teacă, p.201&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1940, Bassarab organized an exhibit, ''Munca legionară'' ("Legionary Labor"), also at Sala Dalles, which represented a fusion of art with Guardist ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Scăiceanu, p.384; Teacă, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; It was attended by [[Traian Brăileanu]], the [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony|Arts Minister]], and Guard Commander [[Horia Sima]].&lt;ref&gt;Teacă, p.202&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterwards, the Guard [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|fell from power]], and Bassarab was arrested on orders from ''[[Conducător]]'' [[Ion Antonescu]].&lt;ref name="icțiganca"/&gt; When Romania entered [[World War II]] in June 1941 as part of [[Operation Barbarossa]], Bassarab was placed into a frontline unit with a high risk of casualties, participating in the recovery of [[Bessarabia]]. He vanished outside [[Țiganca]]. Legends began circulating that he had been killed while [[demining]] a field with his bare hands.&lt;ref name="icțiganca"/&gt; Another account has it that he had been taken prisoner by the [[Red Army]], detained at [[Chișinău]], and finally slashed with a bayonet when he protested against the torturing of a Romanian officer.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolae Goga, "Necrolog.

An obituary by Comarnescu saw print in ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'', praising Bassarab as the "laborer-artist" who, in dying, lived up to his "heroic perspective on art": "it was given to him that he should accomplish more as a Romanian soldier than as an artist, his very sound debut notwithstanding."&lt;ref name="pcfront"/&gt; Bassarab's propaganda work was formally banned soon after [[King Michael's Coup|Antonescu's downfall]], as the new democratic regime and the [[Allied Commission]] clamped down on all forms of fascist literature and art.&lt;ref name="craa4857"/&gt; His widow, who had a degree in philology, never remarried. She survived the rise and fall of [[Communist Romania]] and died in 1999 at age 95. Their son Șerban, born in 1940, pursued a career as a mathematician.&lt;ref&gt;Morariu, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; His father's work was again explored after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]]. In 1999, Petre Oprea republished art chronicles by Bassarab, Stamatu and Zlotescu, noting that their aesthetic hierarchies were often confirmed by posterity.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Rădulescu, [http://www.contemporanul.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/05-Contemporanul-mai-2008.pdf "George Zlotescu.

"'''At the Hop'''"  is a [[rock and roll]]/[[doo-wop]] song written by [[Artie Singer]], [[John Medora]], and [[David White (musician)|David White]] and originally released by [[Danny &amp; the Juniors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''At the Hop'' - Danny and the Juniors |work=Billboard |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=danny &amp; the juniors|chart=all}} |accessdate=5 August 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803131232/http://www.billboard.com/ |archivedate=3 August 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was released in the fall of [[1957 in music|1957]], and reached number one on the [[United States|US]] charts on January 6, 1958, thus becoming one of the top-selling singles of 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= [[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|Macmillan Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] | authorlink=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|year=1998 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|isbn=0-333-74134-X |page=1384 |pages= |url= }}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 August 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  "At the Hop" also hit number one on the R&amp;B Best Sellers list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat more surprisingly, the record reached #3 on the Music Vendor country charts. It was also a big hit elsewhere, which included the group enjoying a number 3 placing with the song on the UK charts.

The song returned to prominence after it was performed by [[rock and roll revival]] act [[Sha Na Na]] at the 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]] and featured in the 1973 [[Coming-of-age story#In film|coming-of-age]] teen comedy ''[[American Graffiti]]''. Musically, it is notable for combining several of the most popular formulas in 1950s rock'n'roll, the [[twelve-bar blues]], [[boogie-woogie]] piano, and the [[50s progression]].

==Background==
The song was written by White, Medora, and Singer in 1957, when Danny &amp; the Juniors were still called The Juvenairs. Initially called "Do the Bop", the song was heard by [[Dick Clark]], who suggested they change the band name to the Juniors and the chorus from "Let's all do the Bop" to "Let's go to the Hop". After performing the song on Clark's show ''[[American Bandstand]]'', it gained popularity and went to the top of the US charts, remaining at number one for five weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= [[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|Macmillan Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] | authorlink=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|year=1998 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|isbn=0-333-74134-X |page=1384 |pages= |url= }}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 August 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The song describes the scene at a [[record hop]], particularly the dances being performed and the interaction with the [[disc jockey]] host.

A sample of the song's lyrics (contemporary popular dances in italics):

:You can rock it you can roll it
:Do the ''stomp'' and even ''[[The Stroll|stroll]]'' it
:At the hop.
:When the record starts spinnin'
:You ''[[chalypso]]'' and you ''[[The Chicken (dance)|chicken]]'' at the hop
:Do the dance sensation that is sweepin' the nation
:at the hop

== Payola involvement ==
On the 2008 nationally-televised [[PBS]] documentary ''Wages of Spin: Dick Clark, American Bandstand and the Payola Scandals'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wages of Spin|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1189398/fullcredits#cast|work=Full cast and crew|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer claimed that [[Dick Clark]] would not play "At the Hop" without receiving half of the publishing proceeds. Singer agreed to make the payments and called the situation "bittersweet" because although he didn't like having to give the money, he credited his success in the music industry to Clark and therefore was grateful to him. [[Payola]] was not illegal at the time and Clark sold the song prior to the 1960 payola hearings.

==Cover versions==
*Children's entertainer's [[Sharon, Lois &amp; Bram]] covered the song on their 1995 album titled ''[[Let's Dance! (Sharon, Lois &amp; Bram album)|Let's Dance!]]''.

*"At The Hop" was covered by German singer [[Freddy Quinn]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= At the Hop - Freddy Quinn | work=[[Allmusic]] | url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t18382434|pure_url=yes}} | accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The song was part of [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]]'s song "Rock'n'Roll Medley", to be found on ''[[Live 1973]]''.

*The [[Canadian National Exhibition]] has been using the song as its advertising theme since 1982, substituting "the Ex" for "the hop". &lt;ref&gt;{{https://youtu.be/B8CT24377d0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1988 film ''[[Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw]]'' featured a variation on the song called "At the Pound". A music video of the song promoting the film was included on various [[Family Home Entertainment]] video cassettes.
*American retro rock-and-roll band [[Flash Cadillac &amp; the Continental Kids]] covered the song as part of the sound track for the 1973 film [[American Graffiti]].  In the film, the band portrayed a fictional band named "Herby and the Heartbeats".  The cover was released as a single in 1973.
It was parodied by [[Dash Rip Rock]] as "Smokin' Pot" and has gone on to be a staple of morning radio shows as a [[bumper music|bumper]] whenever a current topic has to do with marijuana use.

*It is played frequently in the American radio program ''[[The Savage Nation]]'', hosted by talk show host [[Michael Savage]].

Communism alongside [[Marxism-Leninism]] were officially banned in [[Indonesia]] following the aftermath of [[30 September Movement|30 September coup attempt]] and the subsequent [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965-1966|anti-communist killings]],  by adoption of ''TAP MPRS'' no. 25/1966 in 1966 and ''Undang Undang'' no. 27/1999 in 1999, which are still in force. The law does not explicitly declare a ban on symbols of Communism, but [[Indonesian police]] frequently use the law to arrest people displaying it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.detik.com/berita/3206373/ini-penjelasan-kapolri-soal-lambang-palu-arit-yang-dilarang-di-indonesia Police chief explanation on banned hammer and sickle symbol in Indonesia] (in Indonesian)&lt;/ref&gt; Some of its violators were people with no knowledge of symbols of Communism, in which cases the authorities frequently freed them with only minor punishment or small fine applied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://regional.kompas.com/read/2016/07/10/19380351/pakai.kaus.bergambar.palu.arit.seorang.petani.ditangkap.polisi Farmer arrested after wearing shirt with hammer and sickle] (in Indonesian)&lt;/ref&gt; However, displaying such symbols in an attempt to intentionally propagate Communist or Marxist-Leninist ideas are an extremely severe offence, even considered as [[treason]] against the country and could be punished by up to 20 years of prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.hukumonline.com/pusatdata/detail/lt50768a41ad5ab/node/657/tap-mprs-no-xxv_mprs_1966-tahun-1966-pembubaran-partai-komunis-indonesia,-pernyataan-sebagai-organisasi-terlarang-diseluruh-wilayah-negara-republik-indonesia-bagi-partai-komunis-indonesia-dan-larangan-setiap-kegiatan-untuk-menyebarkan-atau-mengembangkan-faham-atau-ajaran-komunis_marxisme-leninisme Explanations on banning communism and Marxism-Leninism in Indonesia] (in Indonesian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wirantaprawira.de/law/criminal/security/index.html Undang Undang no.27/1999, laws on Communism and Marxism-Leninism] (Indonesian)&lt;/ref&gt; This makes Indonesia a country with a very strict [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] policy compared to other countries that also practiced anti-communism.

Other [[socialist]] and [[left-wing]] related symbols, while not officially prohibited by law (as [[democratic socialism]] itself remained acceptable in the country) are still widely condemned by the Indonesian people and considered as being closely related to Communism in general. These include the [[red star]], the [[socialist heraldry]], the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]], and anthems or slogans such as ''[[The Internationale]]'' and "[[Workers of the world, unite!]]". Despite this, ''The Internationale'' was still remained in use during [[International Labour Day]].

In addition, since the [[Transition to the New Order|New Order regime]] was established in 1967, the [[hammer and sickle]] has become [[social stigma|stigmatized]] in the country, which itself is very similar to how [[Nazi symbolism]] is treated in the West in general. As such, displaying the symbol in public, even without any political intentions, is still regarded as highly offensive. Because of this, Indonesians are usually prone to report those who displayed the symbol in public to the authorities.

Indonesia is the first country in the world to introduce a ban on Communist symbols, not including the [[Axis powers|Axis countries]] during [[World War II]].

In April 2017, Indonesian police detained a [[Malaysians|Malaysian]] tourist at a hotel in [[Mataram (city)|Mataram]] for wearing a T-shirt with an image of the hammer and sickle symbol. The tourist was not aware that Communist symbols were banned in Indonesia. The police seized the T-shirt and released the tourist after giving him a warning.&lt;ref name="Malaysian detained in Indonesia for wearing T-shirt with communist symbol"&gt;{{cite|title = Malaysian detained in Indonesia for wearing T-shirt with communist symbol|url = http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysian-detained-in-indonesia-for-wearing-t-shirt-with-communist-symbol|publisher = The Straits Times|date = 14 April 2017|accessdate = 17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, a Russian tourist was confronted by locals and reported to the police in [[Bali]] for flying a Soviet [[Banner of Victory]] to commemorate [[Victory Day]].

===United States===
During the [[First Red Scare|Red Scare of 1919–20]] in the [[United States]], many states passed laws forbidding the display of [[red flag (politics)|red flag]]s, including [[Minnesota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Oklahoma]],&lt;ref&gt;Zechariah Chafee, Jr., ''Freedom of Speech'' (NY: Harcourt, Brace and Howe, 1920), 180ff., Appendix V&lt;/ref&gt; and [[California]].  In ''[[Stromberg v. California]]'', the United States Supreme Court held that such laws are unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;''Stromberg v. California'', 283 U.S. 359 (1931).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moldova===
In 2009, such a ban was proposed in [[Moldova]] by parliamentarian Oleg Serebryan,&lt;ref name=pola/&gt; and the law came into effect in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/moldova-ban-on-use-of-communist-symbols/|title=Moldova: Ban on Use of Communist Symbols - Global Legal Monitor|date=28 November 2012|website=www.loc.gov|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitutional Court of Moldova found it unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=khpg/&gt;  

=== Ukraine ===
In 2015 the Verkhovna Rada passed a [[Ukrainian decommunization laws|law banning communist and nazi symbols]].  Earlier, in 2012, the city of [[Lviv]] in [[Western Ukraine]] banned the public display of Communist symbols.&lt;ref name="runei" /&gt; On December 2015, all communist parties were officially banned in Ukraine.

=== Estonia ===
On November 30, 2006, [[Estonia]]n government signed the draft law to ban politically motivated display of Soviet and Nazi symbols in public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1073110.html|title=Estonia Proposes Ban On Soviet, Nazi Symbols|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 24, 2007 it was passed in the first reading by the parliament. The bill specifies those symbols: the flags, coats of arms, other attributes, and slogans of the USSR, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Germany's [[Nazi Party]], and its SS organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=32427&amp;no_cache=1#.VrGgU_krKM8 "Moscow stung by Estonian ban on totalitarianism's symbols"], ''Eurasia Daily Monitor'', Vol. 4, Issue 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, it eventually failed the parliamentary committee on the grounds of [[freedom of speech]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

=== Lithuania ===
[[Lithuania]] banned Soviet and Nazi symbols in 2008 (Article 188&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; of the Code of Administrative Offences) under the threat of a fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/europe/7459976.stm | work=BBC News | title=Lithuanian ban on Soviet symbols | date=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Article 5 of the Law on Meetings prohibits meetings involving Nazist and Soviet imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Joint amicus curiae brief, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, the laws were in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltictimes.com/audi_featuring_soviet_symbols_banned_from_entering_lithuania/|title=Audi featuring Soviet symbols banned from entering Lithuania|website=www.baltictimes.com|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Latvia ===
In June 2014, the [[Latvia]]n parliament approved a ban on the display of Soviet and Nazi symbols at all public events. The ban involves flags, anthems, uniforms, Nazi ''[[hakenkreuz]]'' and the Soviet [[hammer and sickle]].&lt;ref name="Latvia Bans Soviet, Nazi Symbols"&gt;{{citation|title = Latvia Bans Soviet, Nazi Symbols|url = http://en.ria.ru/russia/20130621/181788657/Latvia-Bans-Soviet-Nazi-Symbols.html|publisher = RIA Novosti|date = 21 Jun 2013|accessdate = 14 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Georgia ===
In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] a ban was introduced in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/georgia-ban-on-soviet-symbols-proposed/|title=Georgia: Ban on Soviet Symbols Proposed - Global Legal Monitor|date=8 December 2010|website=www.loc.gov|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it failed to define the applicable sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dfwatch.net/georgia-to-enforce-ban-on-communist-symbols-44753-23804|title=Georgia to enforce ban on communist symbols|date=31 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, there was a proposal to amend the ban,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-27272993/communist-symbols-to-be-banned-in-georgia|title=Communist symbols to be banned in Georgia|date=4 May 2014|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; however as of 2015, the law remained inactive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gcssi.org/wp2/?p=5618|title="Decommunization of Georgia: causes, excuses and permanent interference."|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Czech Republic===
In 1991, in [[Czechoslovakia]] the criminal code was amended with w § 260 which banned propaganda of movements which restricted human rights and freedoms, citing Nazism and Communism. Later the specific mentions of these were removed citing their lack of clear legal definition. However the law itself was recognized as constitutional.&lt;ref name=khpg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislationline.org/documents/id/17873 "Joint amicus curiae brief for the Constitutional Court of Moldova on the compatibility with European standards"], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2005, there was a petition in the [[Czech Republic]] to ban the promotion of Communism and in 2007, there was a proposed amendment to the law to ban Communist symbols. Both attempts failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expats.cz/prague/article/politics/communists-in-czech-politics/|title=Communists in Czech Politics|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Joint amicus curiae brief, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poland ===
In 2009, in [[Poland]]&lt;ref name=pola&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/politics/poland-bans-communist-symbols/|title=New Polish law equates Communist and Nazi symbols|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; § 2 to 4 were added to Article 256, which ban "fascist, communist or other totalitarian symbols" unless used "as part of artistic, educational, collecting or academic activity." On July 19, 2011, the [[Constitutional Tribunal of Poland]] found this ban unconstitutional due to the violation of [[freedom of expression]].&lt;ref&gt;Joint amicus curiae brief, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, Poland updated its "[[decommunization]]" legislation to include Soviet propaganda monuments, prompting negative reactions from the Russian government.&lt;ref name="Russia warns Poland not to touch Soviet WW2 memorials"&gt;{{cite|title = Russia warns Poland not to touch Soviet WW2 memorials|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40775355|publisher = BBC News|date = 31 July 2017|accessdate = 2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hungary ===
[[Hungary]] had a law (Article 269/B of the Criminal Code (2000)) that banned the use of symbols of fascist and communist dictatorships.&lt;ref name=khpg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1430564974|title=Analysis of the Law on Prohibiting Communist Symbols - Human Rights in Ukraine|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hungarian Criminal Code 269 / B. § 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The same year the Constitutional Court upheld the law when it was challenged, claiming that the involved restriction of the [[freedom of expression]] was justified.&lt;ref&gt;Joint amicus curiae brief, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] considered the challenge of Attila Vajnai who was charged with a misdemeanor for use of the [[red star]] and declared the Hungarian law to be in violation of the freedom of expression. The Court recognized the gross violations by the Nazi and Communist regimes; however, it noted that modern Hungary is a stable democracy with negligible chance of dictatorship, therefore restrictions on the freedom of expression have no justification in the country in the form of a "clear, pressing and specific social need".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.hu/20080709/european-court-overturns-hungarian-prohibition-on-communist-star/|title=European court overturns Hungarian prohibition on "communist" star|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the law was annulled in 2013 by the Constitutional Court, citing the lack of precise definition and the European Court of Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2013/02/20/hungary-court-annuls-ban-on-fascist-communist-symbols/|title=Hungary Court Annuls Ban on Fascist, Communist Symbols|first=Veronika|last=Gulyas|date=20 February 2013|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]] introduced a draft law that outlaws merchandise featuring symbols like the Nazi swastika or the communist five-pointed red star, including the one used by the Dutch brewing company [[Heineken International|Heineken]].&lt;ref name="Hungary threatens to ban Heineken's red star as 'communist'"&gt;{{cite|title = Hungary threatens to ban Heineken's red star as 'communist'|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/24/hungary-threatens-to-ban-heineken-star-logo-as-communist|publisher = The Guardian|date = 24 March 2017|accessdate = 29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Romania ===
[[Romania]]n Law 51/1991, Art.3 considers the following as threats to national security: "initiating, organizing, committing or supporting in any way totalitarian or extremist actions of a communist, fascist, legionary or of any other racist, antisemitic, revisionist, separatist nature that can endanger in any way the unity and territorial integrity of Romania, and inciting actions that can endanger the rule of law". However, symbols are not mentioned in the Law.

=== Bulgaria ===
In [[Bulgaria]], lawmakers have voted on 24 November 2016 to make the public display of communist symbols illegal. The law, known as the "Criminal Nature of the Communist Regime", requires that signs and items created during the Communist regime glorifying the former Communist party and its leaders be removed from public places. A ban is introduced on putting such signs in public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bta.bg/en/c/DF/id/1466614|title=Parliament Passes Amendments to Act Declaring the Criminal Nature of the Communist Regime in Bulgaria|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.euscoop.com/en/2017/9/7/protests-for-removal-of-soviet-monument|title=New protests for the removal of the statue of the Soviet Army in Sofia|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.calvertjournal.com/news/show/7304/bulgaria-bans-public-display-of-communist-symbols|title=Bulgaria bans public display of communist symbols|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mongolia ===
In 2012, [[Mongolia]] has removed the last statue of [[Vladimir Lenin]] in its capital, [[Ulaanbaatar]]. No law on decommunization in the country will be planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-19940437|title=Mongolian capital removes Lenin|date=14 October 2012|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Croatia===
The use of fascist and communist symbols is currently under review in [[Croatia]], one of the discussions being the banning of the [[red star]], a symbol used by the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] during the [[Croatian War of Independence]].&lt;ref name="Croatia to Review Use of Fascist, Communist Symbols"&gt;{{cite|title = Croatia to Review Use of Fascist, Communist Symbols|url = http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/croatian-govt-forms-dealing-with-past-council-03-02-2017|publisher = Balkan Insight|author = Sven Milekic|date = 2 March 2017|accessdate = 8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albania===
[[Albania]]'s Institute for Communist Crimes (ICC) proposed a ban on [[Cinema of Albania|communist-era films]], sparking negative reactions from the public.&lt;ref name="Proposed Ban on Albanian Communist Films Sparks Backlash"&gt;{{cite|title = Proposed Ban on Albanian Communist Films Sparks Backlash|url = http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/initiative-to-ban-albanian-communist-movies-couse-backlash-03-15-2017#sthash.CjsDtU7P.dpuf|publisher = Balkan Insight|author = Fatjona Mejdini|date = 16 March 2017|accessdate = 1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The [[Flag of East Germany]] was outlawed as an unconstitutional and criminal symbol in West Germany and West Berlin, where it was referred to as the {{lang|de|Spalterflagge}} (secessionist flag) until the late 1960s, when the ban was lifted.

===South Korea===
Similarly, the [[flag of North Korea]] is prohibited in [[South Korea]] as an unconstitutional symbol though some exceptions exist.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-games-asian-northkorea-flag/seoul-reminds-citizens-of-north-korea-flag-ban-idUSKBN0H708Z20140912&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aroundtherings.com/site/A__62654/Title__South-Korea-Makes-Olympic-Exception-for-North-Korean-Flag/292/Articles|title=South Korea Makes Olympic Exception for North Korean Flag|website=aroundtherings.com|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union==
In January 2005, [[Vytautas Landsbergis]], backed by  Member of the [[European Parliament]] from Hungary, [[Jozsef Szajer]], urged a ban on the Communist symbols in the [[European Union]], in addition to [[Nazi symbols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/11858/|title=Estonian MEP supports ban of communist symbols|website=www.baltictimes.com|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2005, the [[European Commission]] rejected calls for a proposed Europe-wide ban on Nazi symbols to be extended to cover Communist Party symbols as well. However this rejection did not rule out the individual states having their own laws in this respect.&lt;ref&gt;JOINT AMICUS CURIAE BRIEF, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4248425.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - EU rejects Communist symbol ban|website=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, a group of MEPs including Landsbergis addressed a letter to the President of the European Parliament, in which they requested a ban of symbols of totalitarian regimes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2942">Jewish theatre artists have long influenced and co-created British theatre. In 2012, British theatre critic Michael Billington claimed that “modern theatre" is heavily dependent "on Jewish writers.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Billington|first1=Michael|title=J is for Jewish Dramatists|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/feb/14/jewish-dramatists-modern-drama|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A significant proportion of British theatre artists, such as Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard, Peter Brook, Mike Leigh, Steven Berkoff, Patrick Marber, Nicholas Hytner, Sam Mendes, Jonathan Miller, Ryan Craig, Julia Pascal, Nina Raine, Diane Samuels, Shellley Silas or Gail Louw (see the [[List of British Jewish entertainers]]), are of Jewish cultural heritage, and thus ‘differently’ cultured. As Peter Lawson argues, Israel Zangwill's dramatization of his novel ''Children of the Ghetto'' (1899) is the first notable British-Jewish play, focused on immigration to the East End.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lawson, Peter, |editor1-last=in Baskin|editor1-first=Judith, R.|title=Judaism &amp; Jewish Culture|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge UP|pages=592-593}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that there is a British-Jewish theatre emphasises the specific historical, ideological and institutional contexts and frameworks shaping Jewish-inflected theatre artists in Britain. Many of the Anglo-Jewish theatre or British-Jewish practitioners grew up in specifically Jewish environments (e.g.: Pinter, Kops, Wesker, Berkoff) to parents who were immigrants or first-generation British citizens. In these homes, Yiddish was often spoken and Hebrew read, different foods were cooked, different body languages seen, and the patterns of speech (often found in Pinter, Kops or Berkoff) were not quite British. British-Jewish theatre is shaped by specific historical, ideological and institutional contexts and frameworks, such as the role of still prevalent stereotypes and low-level anti-Semitism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pascal|first1=Julia|title=Time to bury Fagin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/17/jewish-stereotypes-fagin-shylock|website=The Guardian: Opinion|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the controversies around the Israeli-Palestine conflict.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5444">[[Image:Meister des Book of Lindisfarne 002.jpg|thumb|A carpet page from the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]]]]'''Carpet pages''' are a characteristic feature of [[Insular art|Insular]] [[illuminated manuscript]]s.  They are pages of mainly geometrical ornamentation, which may include repeated animal forms, typically placed at the beginning of each of the four [[Gospels]] in [[Gospel Book]]s. The designation "carpet page" is used to describe those pages in Christian, Islamic, or Jewish illuminated manuscripts that contain little or no text and which are filled entirely with decorative motifs.&lt;ref&gt;The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Elizabeth Howie: DUBLIN, TRINITY COLLEGE MS A.4.5 (57) — GOSPEL BOOK (BOOK OF DURROW)[http://www.unc.edu/celtic/catalogue/manuscripts/durrow.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/mamlukquran.html British Library, ''Mamluk Qur'an'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/educational_site/biblical_manuscripts/LeningradCarpetPage.shtml# |title=West Semitic Research Project, ''The Leningrad Codex Carpet Page'' |access-date=2010-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126125718/http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/educational_site/biblical_manuscripts/LeningradCarpetPage.shtml# |archive-date=2010-11-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are distinct from pages devoted to highly decorated [[historiated initial]]s, though the style of decoration may be very similar.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 36-37&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpet pages are wholly devoted to ornamentation with brilliant colors, active lines, and complex patterns of [[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]].  They are normally symmetrical, or very nearly so, about both a horizontal and vertical axis, though for example the page at right is only symmetrical about a vertical axis.  Some [[art historians]] find their origin in similar [[Copt]]ic decorative book pages,&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 53&lt;/ref&gt; and they also clearly borrow from contemporary metalwork decoration. [[Oriental carpets]], or other textiles, may themselves have been influences.  The tooled leather book binding of the [[St Cuthbert Gospel]] represents a simple carpet page in another medium,&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 53&lt;/ref&gt; and the few surviving [[treasure binding]]s - metalwork book covers or [[book shrine]]s - from the same period, such as that on the [[Lindau Gospels]], are also close parallels.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 57-60&lt;/ref&gt;  Roman floor [[mosaic]]s seen in post-Roman Britain, are also cited as a possible source.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 53&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Hebrew]] [[Codex Cairensis]], from 9th century [[Galilee]], also contains a similar type of page, but stylistically very different.

The earliest surviving example is from the early 7th century [[Bobbio Orosius]], and relates more closely to [[Late Antique]] decoration.  There are notable carpet pages in the [[Book of Kells]], [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], [[Book of Durrow]], and other manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, 36-37, 46-62&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpet pages are also found in some medieval [[Hebrew]] manuscripts, typically opening the major sections of the book. Islamic manuscripts, especially [[Qur'an]]s, often have pages entirely devoted to complex geometrical decoration, but the term is not usually used of them.

A '''charnel house''' is a [[vault (architecture)|vault]] or building where human skeletal remains are stored. They are often built near [[Church architecture|churches]] for depositing bones that are unearthed while digging [[grave (burial)|grave]]s. The term can also be used more generally as a description of a place filled with [[death]] and destruction.

== Africa, Europe, and Asia ==
In countries where ground suitable for burial was scarce, corpses would be interred for approximately five years following death, thereby allowing decomposition to occur. After this, the remains would be exhumed and moved to an [[ossuary]] or charnel house, thereby allowing the original burial place to be reused. In modern times, the use of charnel houses is a characteristic of cultures living in rocky or arid places, such as the [[Cyclades]] archipelago and other Greek islands in the [[Aegean Sea]].

[[File:Beinhaus Évora.JPG|thumb|Skulls in a charnel house]]

[[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai]] is famous for having a working charnel house. Saint Catherine's was founded by [[Justinian]] in the early 6th century, on the site of an older monastery founded about 313 AD and named for [[Helena of Constantinople]]. The monastery comprises the whole [[Eastern Orthodox Church organization|Autonomous Church]] of Sinai, under the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|Patriarchate of Jerusalem]]. The site lies at the foot of Mount Sinai where Christians believe [[Moses]] received the Ten Commandments.&lt;ref&gt;Holy Bible NIV: Exodus 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Sinai is an inhospitable place, the brethren of St. Catherine's have struggled to eke out a subsistence-level existence. The difficulty in establishing a large cemetery in the rocky ground notwithstanding, relics are also gathered for temporal and spiritual reasons: a reminder to the monks of their impending death and fate in the hereafter. The Archbishop of Saint Catherine's is commonly the [[Abbot]] as well. After death, he is afforded the dignity of a special niche within the "Skull-House".

== North America ==
A charnel house is also a structure commonly seen in some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] societies of the Eastern United States. Major examples are the [[Hopewell culture]]s and [[Mississippian culture]]s. These houses were used specifically for [[mortuary]] services and, although they required many more resources to build and maintain than a [[crypt]], they were widely used. They offered privacy and shelter as well as enough workspace for mortuary proceedings. These proceedings included [[cremation]] (in the included crematorium) as well as defleshing of the body before the cremation. Once the houses had served their purpose, they were burned to the ground and covered by earth, creating a sort of burial [[mound]]. Anthropologist William F. Romain in ''Mysteries of the Hopewell'' notes that these charnel houses were built in the form of a square, and their diagonals could be aligned to the direction of maximum and minimum moon-sets both north and south.

== England ==
Charnel houses do not appear to have been common in England. The earliest reference found to a charnel house was in the parish of [[St Mary-at-Hill]] in London, during the sixteenth century. Few other charnel houses are attested in the seventeenth century, usually within overcrowded urban contexts.&lt;ref&gt;cf. N.J.G. Pounds, ''A History of the English Parish'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Code of Hammurabi''' is a well-preserved [[Babylonia]]n [[code of law]] of ancient [[Mesopotamia]], dated back to about 1754 BC ([[Middle Chronology]]).  It is one of the oldest deciphered writings of significant length in the world. The sixth Babylonian king, [[Hammurabi]], enacted the code. A partial copy exists on a 2.25 metre (7.5 ft) stone [[stele]]. It consists of 282 laws, with scaled punishments, adjusting "an [[eye for an eye]], a tooth for a tooth" (''lex talionis'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review: The Code of Hammurabi|first= J. Dyneley |last=Prince|journal= The American Journal of Theology |volume= 8| issue =  3 |date=July 1904|pages= 601–609 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |jstor=3153895}}&lt;/ref&gt; as graded depending on social status, of slave versus free, man or woman.&lt;ref name="Bar"&gt;[[Gabriele Bartz]], Eberhard König, (Arts and Architecture), Könemann, Köln, (2005), {{ISBN|3-8331-1943-8}}. The laws were based with scaled punishments, adjusting "an eye for an eye" depending on social status.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly half of the code deals with matters of contract, establishing the wages to be paid to an ox driver or a surgeon for example. Other provisions set the terms of a transaction, the liability of a builder for a house that collapses, or property that is damaged while left in the care of another. A third of the code addresses issues concerning household and family relationships such as inheritance, divorce, paternity, and [[sexual behavior|reproductive behaviour]]. Only one provision appears to impose obligations on an official; this provision establishes that a judge who reaches an incorrect decision is to be fined and removed from the bench permanently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonlaw.com/Hammurabi.html Code of Hammurabi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921205329/http://www.commonlaw.com/Hammurabi.html |date=21 September 2007 }} at commonlaw.com  {{cite |url=http://www.commonlaw.com/home/legal-history-and-philosophy/code-of-hammurabi |date=22 May 2017 |title=Code of Hammarubi at Commonlaw }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few provisions address issues related to military service.

The code was discovered by modern [[archaeology|archaeologists]] in 1901, and its ''[[editio princeps]]'' translation published in 1902 by [[Jean-Vincent Scheil]]. This nearly complete example of the code is carved into a basalt stele in the shape of a huge [[index finger]],&lt;ref&gt;Iconographic Evidence for Some Mesopotamian Cult Statues, Dominique Collon, Die Welt der Götterbilder, Edited by Groneberg, Brigitte; Spieckermann, Hermann;, and Weiershäuser, Frauke, Berlin, New York (Walter de Gruyter) 2007, pp. 57–84&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|2.25|m|foot|abbr=on}} tall. The code is inscribed in the [[Akkadian language]], using [[cuneiform script]] carved into the stele. 

It is currently on display in the [[Louvre]], with replicas in numerous institutions, including the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago]], the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law in Chicago, the Clendening History of Medicine Library &amp; Museum at the University of Kansas Medical Center, the library of the [[Theological University of the Reformed Churches]] in the Netherlands, the [[Pergamon Museum]] of Berlin, the Arts Faculty of the University of Leuven in Belgium, the [[National Museum of Iran]] in Tehran, and the Department of Anthropology, [[National Museum of Natural History]], [[Smithsonian Institution]], the University Museum at the University of Pennsylvania, and [[Museum of the Bible]] in Washington, DC.

[[Hammurabi]] ruled for nearly 42 years, from about 1792 to 1749 BC according to the [[Middle chronology]]. In the preface to the law, he states, "[[Anu]] and [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]] called by name me, Hammurabi, the exalted prince, who feared God, to bring about the rule of righteousness in the land, to destroy the wicked and the evil-doers; so that the strong should not harm the weak; so that I should rule over the black-headed people like [[Shamash]], and enlighten the land, to further the well-being of mankind."&lt;ref name="wsu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MESO/CODE.HTM |title=Mesopotamia: The Code of Hammurabi |accessdate=14 September 2007 |publisher=Washington State University |year=1996 |author1=Edited by Richard Hooker |author2=Translated by L.W King |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909114038/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MESO/CODE.HTM |archivedate=9 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the stone slab are 44 columns and 28 paragraphs that contained 282 laws.

It had been taken as plunder by the [[Elam|Elamite]] king [[Shutruk-Nahhunte]] in the 12th century BC and was taken to [[Susa]] in [[Elam]] (located in the present-day [[Khuzestan Province]] of Iran) where it was no longer available to the Babylonian people. However, when [[Cyrus the Great]] brought both Babylon and Susa under the rule of his [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], and placed copies of the document in the [[Cyrus the Great#Library at Sippar|Library of Sippar]], the text became available for all the peoples of the vast Persian Empire to view.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Van De Mieroop: A History of the Ancient Near East, second edition p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Egyptologist [[Gustave Jéquier]], a member of an expedition headed by [[Jacques de Morgan]], found the stele containing the Code of Hammurabi during archaeological excavations at the ancient site of Susa in Khuzestan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0H0EpSm8aioC&amp;pg=PA313&amp;lpg=PA313&amp;dq=khuzestan+susa+hammurabi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ckH25GVD5y&amp;sig=KJOFs2tnpffmgH_yfQUdZMagTUo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBmoVChMI9KWthsvvyAIVR8FjCh2LZwPw#v=onepage&amp;q=khuzestan%20susa%20hammurabi&amp;f=false|title=Cultures in Contact: From Mesopotamia to the Mediterranean in the Second Millennium B.C|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|date=2013|access-date=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws of Hammurabi's Code==
{{Main article|Babylonian law}}
The Code of Hammurabi was one of the only sets of laws in the [[ancient Near East]] and also one of the first forms of law.&lt;ref name="yale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hamframe.htm |title=The Code of Hammurabi: Translated by L.W.

University of Michigan Library, 2009, (originally published in 1916 by American Sunday-School Union) p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;
These codes come from similar cultures in a relatively small geographical area, and they have passages which resemble each other.&lt;ref&gt;Barton 2009, p. 406. Barton, a scientist of Semitic languages at the University of Pennsylvania from 1922 to 1931, stated that while there are similarities between the Mosaic Law and the Code of Hammurabi, a study of the entirety of both laws "convinces the student that the laws of the Old Testament are in no essential way dependent upon the Babylonian laws." He states that "such resemblances" arose from "a similarity of antecedents and of general intellectual outlook" between the two cultures, but that "the striking differences show that there was no direct borrowing."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Milkau Oberer Teil der Stele mit dem Text von Hammurapis Gesetzescode 369-2.png|thumb|Figures at the top of the stele "fingernail", above Hammurabi's code of laws.]]
The Code of Hammurabi is the longest surviving text from the Old Babylonian period.&lt;ref&gt;"The Code of Hammurabi," [http://www.historyguide.org/ancient/hammurabi.html], The History Guide, 3 August 2009, Retrieved on 2 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The code has been seen as an early example of a fundamental law, regulating a government – i.e., a primitive [[constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;What is a Constitution? William David Thomas, Gareth Stevens (2008) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flach, Jacques.  Le Code de Hammourabi et la constitution originaire de la propriete dans l'ancienne Chaldee. (Revue historique.  Paris, 1907. 8. v. 94, pp. 272–289.&lt;/ref&gt; The code is also one of the earliest examples of the idea of [[presumption of innocence]], and it also suggests that both the accused and accuser have the opportunity to provide [[evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;Victimology: Theories and Applications, Ann Wolbert Burgess, Albert R. Roberts, Cheryl Regehr, Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning, 2009, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; The occasional nature of many provisions suggests that the code may be better understood as a codification of Hammurabi's supplementary judicial decisions, and that, by memorializing his wisdom and justice, its purpose may have been the self-glorification of Hammurabi rather than a modern legal code or constitution. However, its copying in subsequent generations indicates that it was used as a model of legal and judicial reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;For this alternative interpretation see Jean Bottéro, "The 'Code' of Hammurabi" in ''Mesopotamia: Writing, Reasoning and the Gods'' (University of Chicago, 1992), pp. 156–184.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Code of Hammurabi was trying to achieve equality, biases still existed towards those categorized in the lower end of the social spectrum and some of the punishments and justice could be gruesome. The magnitude of criminal penalties often was based on the identity and gender of both the person committing the crime and the victim. The Code issues justice following the three classes of Babylonian society: property owners, freed men, and slaves.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/8-things-you-may-not-know-about-hammurabis-code|title=8 Things You May Not Know About Hammurabi’s Code|work=History.com|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Punishments for someone assaulting someone from a lower class were far lighter than if they had assaulted someone of equal or higher status.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/8-things-you-may-not-know-about-hammurabis-code|title=8 Things You May Not Know About Hammurabi’s Code|work=History.com|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a doctor killed a rich patient, he would have his hands cut off, but if he killed a slave, only financial restitution was required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyextra.com/article/international-history/nutshell-babylon|title=What was Babylon? |work=History Extra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women could also receive punishments that their male counterparts would not, as men were permitted to have affairs with their servants and slaves, whereas married women would be harshly punished for committing adultery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Various copies of portions of the Code of Hammurabi have been found on baked clay tablets, some possibly older than the celebrated basalt stele now in the Louvre. The Prologue of the Code of Hammurabi (the first 305 inscribed squares on the stele) is on such a tablet, also at the Louvre (Inv #AO 10237). Some gaps in the list of benefits bestowed on cities recently annexed by Hammurabi may imply that it is older than the famous stele (currently dated to the early 18th century BC).&lt;ref&gt;Fant, Clyde E. and Mitchell G.

Eerdmans Publishing Co., p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Museum of the Ancient Orient]], part of the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]], also has a "Code of Hammurabi" clay tablet, dated to 1790 BC, in (Room 5, Inv # Ni 2358).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Freely|Freely, John]], ''Blue Guide Istanbul'' (5th ed., 2000), London: [[A&amp;C Black]], New York: [[WW Norton]], p. 121.

In July 2010, archaeologists reported that a fragmentary Akkadian cuneiform tablet was discovered at [[Tel Hazor]], [[Israel]], containing a c. 1700 BC text that was said to be partly parallel to portions of the Hammurabi code. The Hazor law code fragments are currently being prepared for publication by a team from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/138788|title=Code of Hammurabi Tablet Found |work=Inside Israel News – Arutz Sheva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4642">A '''Daunian stele''' is a type of stone funerary monument constructed by the [[Daunians]], an [[Iapygians|Iapygian]] tribe which inhabited [[Apulia]] in [[classical antiquity]]. Daunian stelae were made from the end of the 8th century BC to the 6th century BC. They consist of a parallelepiped-shaped plate, which protrudes from the upper head and decorated on all four sides. Sizes vary between 40 and 130&amp;nbsp;cm in height, and consequently, between 20 and 80&amp;nbsp;cm in width while the thickness is between 3 and 12&amp;nbsp;cm.

==Description==
Daunian stelea were made from [[limestone]] in the southern part of [[Gargano]] where 2000 copies were found. Originally they were placed vertically on top of the [[mound]] covering the tomb, with a base devoid decoration that was stuck in the ground. Their decorations were executed with more or less deep incisions, a schematic representation of the deceased in their full dress funeral (decoration primary) accompanied by ornaments and abstract figurative scenes that form filler (secondary decoration).

The stars are divided into two categories depending on the presence of weapons in the depiction of the deceased, or ornaments. The first category would cover warriors, belonging to approximately 14% of the stelae found, while the second group, which includes all others, also includes the many stars which refer to female characters, approximately 6% of total stele found, which have a characteristic style with long braid on the back, also in depictions on pottery.

Figures with the ornaments as covering the whole body except the arms folded on the chest and covered with embroidered cotton gloves, and head covered with a tall conical hat that stretches to cover the neck. Among the deceased  ornaments are necklaces to more speed, large brooches and pendants long bracket composite chest, belt or pendant circular form of pomegranate and tapes, and pairs of large pendants in the center, and fermatrecce with three points for the circular female figures.
Warriors have a chest cardiophylax (plate protection for the upper chest) rectangular with concave sides, which is hung a sword "cross", kept in its scabbard and placed transversely to the hilt to the right, the spadapendono below the tape. The arms are always close to the chest, but with no ornaments. On the back, hangs a large shield round hoplite type, with "episema" (central theme) geometric (radial and vortex of the most common reasons) or, more rarely figured. The heads are in this case obtained in a separate block and insert the neck through a hole, have a circular shape and had to be covered by a helmet or other headgear.
The figurative scenes are rendered with subtle engravings and characters are both human and animals and fantastic creatures, and gods theriomorphic (depicted with animal features). They are engraved with scenes of funerals, with processions of bearers of offerings with containers on their heads, accompanied by a lyre player, but there are also representations of daily activities: fishing, sailing ships from sailing with square or, more rarely different types of hunting, both on horseback with the lance (deer hunting) and walk with the sling (birds). The stele of warriors often have processions of chariots or fight scenes, which were interpreted as funeral games in honor of the deceased, or hunting scenes and battles, which sometimes appear warrior with a helmet or mask in the form of bucranium three horns. Often there appear also fantastic animals ([[Pegasus|pegasi]], [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeras]] and [[sea serpent]]s, among others).&lt;ref&gt;Maria Luisa Nava, "Le stele della Daunia", in ''Atti del XIII Convegno di Studi Etruschi Italici'', Manfredonia 1980, Firenze, Leo Olski ed., 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Death by Hanging'''''|絞死刑|Kōshikei}} is a 1968 Japanese film directed by [[Nagisa Oshima]], starring Do-yun Yu. It was acclaimed for its innovative [[Brechtian]] techniques and complex treatments of guilt and consciousness, justice, and the persecution of ethnic [[Koreans in Japan]].

== Plot ==
A documentary-like opening introduces a death chamber where an execution is about to take place. Inexplicably, the man to be executed, an ethnic Korean known only as R, survives hanging but loses his memory. The officials who witness the hanging debate how to proceed, as the law could be interpreted as forbidding execution of an individual who does not recognize their crime and its punishment.  
They decide that they must persuade R to accept guilt by reminding him of his crimes{{snd}} at this point the film moves into a highly theatricalized film-within-a-film structure.

In scenes of absurd and perverse humor, the officials recreate R's first crime, the rape of a young woman.  This failing, they attempt to recreate his childhood by way of performing crude racist stereotypes of Koreans held by some Japanese. Exasperated, they resort to visiting the scene of R's other crime at an abandoned high school, but in an overzealous moment of reenactment, an official murders a girl. Back in the death chamber, a woman claiming to be R's "sister" appears one by one to the officials.  She tries to convince R that his crimes are justified by Korean nationalism against a Japanese enemy, but after failing to win him over, is herself hanged. At a drinking party to celebrate her hanging, the officials reveal their guilt-ridden, violent pasts, oblivious to R and his "sister" lying on the floor amongst them, themselves exploring R's psyche. The prosecutor invites R to leave a free man, but when he opens the door, he is driven back by an intense burst of light from outside, symbolizing the fact that as a Korean he will never be accepted by Japanese society. Finally, R admits to the crimes, but proclaims himself innocent{{snd}} stating that if the officers execute him, then they are murderers as well. In his second hanging, R's body disappears, leaving an empty noose hanging beneath the gallows.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Ian. "Nagisa Oshima." In Second Wave England: November Books, 1970. pp. 70–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The character R in ''Death by Hanging'' was based on [[Ri Chin'u]], an ethnic Korean who in 1958 murdered two Japanese school girls.  A precocious, talented young man, he not only confessed to his crimes, but wrote about them in great detail; his writings, collected as ''Crime, Death, and Love'' became nearly as famous as his crimes and persona.  Much of his book consisted of correspondence with [[Bok Junan]], a Korean journalist sympathetic to the [[communist]] North.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turim|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "sister" character was developed from this relationship, indicating the journalist's Korean nationalist interpretation of Ri's life and experiences.  Much of R and the "sister's" dialogue is taken from this correspondence.  Oshima held Ri Chin'u in high regard, despite his crimes.  Claiming him to be "the most intelligent and sensitive youth produced by postwar Japan", Oshima thought his prose "ought to be included in high school textbooks".  Oshima first wrote a script about him in 1963, but this was not the version that eventually was filmed.&lt;ref&gt;Oshima, Nagisa. "About Death By Hanging". pp. 166–169 in Cinema, Censorship, and the State: The Writings of Nagisa Oshima, 1956-1978, ed. Annette Michelson. Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to 1968, the idea was conceptually reworked, with Ri Chin'u negated as hero and replaced by R, a Korean subject more open to experimental treatment and analysis.  The resulting film is just as much concerned with the domestic repression of Koreans in Japan as with the death penalty, but remains cinematically important because of its theoretical and conceptual innovations.&lt;ref name="Turim1998"/&gt;

==Themes==
===Guilt and consciousness===
For all its dark absurdity, ''Death by Hanging'' addresses a number of themes{{snd}} guilt and consciousness, and also race and discrimination (all within a greater context of state violence){{snd}} with great gravity. The guiding juxtaposition is of the criminal consciousness with the state's license to commit violence without guilt.  If the state has internalized in its formation communal norms of "guilt" and "justice", thereby wielding violence legitimately (even if{{snd}} in this case{{snd}} wrapped in a context of ethnic bigotry), it must still prove guilt to transgressors, in this case, the character R.  Guilt is culturally learned, but R presents the difficulty of not being aware of guilt or acknowledgement of violating social boundaries in his crimes; he likewise remains unaware of his own ethnicity and cannot comprehend the link (as it is presented to him) between his ethnicity and his alleged criminality. Both the assorted officials (legal, scientific, and metaphysic representatives) and his "sister" (representative of nationalism) attempt, but fail to recreate R's consciousness. In fact, their own violent actions (simulated rape, murder, recollection of war crimes) and ignorance accentuate the contradiction of violence and guilt{{snd}} the state that has been sanctioned to kill is constituted by people just as guilty and worthy of punishment as R, the criminal. The implications extend far beyond a mere commentary on the [[death penalty]], but pose an open-ended series of questions about the relationship between the individual and the state, between violence and guilt (or an understood concept of guilt), and between ethnic discrimination and the various products of discrimination:  as Koreans were discriminated against and denied legitimacy by Japan, so R denies Japanese state authority. His body's refusal to die becomes an act of resistance against the state and its delineation of justified and unjustified violence.&lt;ref&gt;Standish, Isolde. A New History of Japanese Cinema New York: Continuum, 2005. pp. 244–250.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation resonates with Oshima's long-standing concern with the plight of the Korean minority, and with the painful history of the Japanese occupation of Korea and war-time atrocities.

===A Brechtian theater of the absurd===
Despite its documentary style, from the start, as voiceover and image give contradictory information, it is clear that ''Death by Hanging'' is not a presentation of "reality". This distancing is compounded by the seven intertitles that give an indication of the action about to occur (or in a psychoanalytic interpretation, displacing R as a defined subject). These techniques have established the film as Oshima's most [[Brechtian]]. Other ideas borrowed from [[Brecht]] include dark humor, the theme of justice, and an exploration of open-ended, unresolved contradictions. That a death chamber serves as this unlikely theater of the absurd underscores the film's dominant ironic tone. Rich in symbolism and visual allusions, Oshima's ''[[mise en scène]]'' contains a number of subtle, masterful touches, such as the newspapered walls in the reconstruction of R's youth referencing the intense media scrutiny of Ri Chin'u. Another theatrical element observed by Maureen Turim is the important role of dialogue: "much of the humor and irony is a matter of verbal repartee, presented in exquisite timing and visual framing."&lt;ref name="Turim1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Turim|1998|pages=61–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''Death by Hanging'' was released theatrically in Japan on March 9, 1968, where it was distributed by [[Toho]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=247}} This was the first Toho release in [[Vista Vision]] size format.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=247}} The film was released in the United States theatrically by [[New Yorker Films]] with English subtitles on December 8, 1971.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=247}}

== Reception ==
In Japan, the film won the ''[[Kinema Junpo]]'' Award for Best Screenplay.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=247}}

[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' found the film provocative and entertaining while it focused on capital punishment, but felt it reached a point of total confusion as it became more [[Godardian]] or Brechtian. He also called Oshima's directing "hugely concerned and committed to the sort of cinema that plays an active role in its society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Canby|first1=Vincent|title=Death By Hanging (1968)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A01E2D8133FEF34BC4D52DFB466838F669EDE|website=The New York Times|date=February 15, 1974|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Richie]] of the ''[[Japan Times]]'' felt that halfway through the film, when R's sister appears, the film's statement is "clear, direct, double-edged, and brilliantly delivered", but afterward it "unravels, getting more and more woolly-headed while the words come thicker and longer and faster". However, he still felt that at the end, the film raised important questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richie|first1=Donald|title=Donald Richie on 'Koshikei (Death by Hanging)'|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2013/01/17/films/film-reviews/donald-richie-on-koshikei-death-by-hanging/|website=The Japan Times|date=January 28, 1968|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Excessivism is a reflection, examination, or investigation of every aspect of life in excessive state with particular consideration to the areas that have real and consequential effect on the members of the society.  Subject areas are, but not limited to, economics, politics and psychology. In the area of economics it is a commentary on [[economic materialism]]. It reflects, examines and investigates the excessive desire to acquire material goods beyond one's needs and often means.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Excessivism depicts the excessive use of resources in an exaggerated way, by means of two- or three-dimensional visual creations, written or spoken words, or in any other manner. It aims at a reflection, examination, or investigation of the capitalist system, devoid of aesthetic, legal, commercial, ethical, moral, racial, or religious considerations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The goal of the capitalist system is to deliver profit for private investors, or corporations (without consideration of consequences including human and environmental), as contrasted to cooperatively or state-owned means of wealth. Said structure provides incomparable contribution to economic growth, employment and prosperity. According to [[determinism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Southern Cone Model: The Political Economy of Regional Capitalist Development in Latin America|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=w0N-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=excessive+economic+determinism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=excessive%2520economic%2520determinism&amp;f=false|publisher = Routledge|date = 2004-08-02|isbn = 9781134327089|first = Nicola|last = Phillips}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Charting a New Course: The Politics of Globalization and Social Transformation|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5CEGwRutaEEC|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield|date = 2001-01-01|isbn = 9780742508934|first = Fernando Henrique|last = Cardoso|first2 = Mauricio Augusto|last2 = Font}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Crafting Qualitative Research: Working in the Postpositivist Traditions|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KtDKBgAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 2015-02-24|isbn = 9781317473695|first = Pushkala|last = Prasad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Elgar Companion to Radical Political Economy|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lc6b1Q1Kf1YC|publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing|date = 1994-01-01|isbn = 9781843768647|first = Philip|last = Arestis|first2 = Malcolm C.|last2 = Sawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; freedom of choice is illusory and society is positioned to function as a reliable producer of excess, the lubricant of the capitalist engine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
The inaugural exhibition of Excessivism took place in LA Artcore Brewery Annex gallery with the title "Excessivist Initiative".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; And the Excessivism Manifesto was published in [[Downtown News]] weekly in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[[Downtown News]], Excessivism Manifesto, September 28, 2015 page 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://www.survivorlibrary.com/library/architect_and_engineer_of_california_vol_22_1910.pdf |title=The Architect and Engineer of California Volume 22 |publisher=The Architect and Engineer Co. |date=August 1910 |accessdate=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an art critic Shana Nys Dambrot the idea was conceived in the studio of the founder based on his personal realizations of his relationship as a consumer with the capitalist environment.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  Excessivism was introduced to the Los Angeles art scene in November 2014 in the Red Pipe gallery in an  exhibition titled ''Excess The New Norm''. It was curated by art critic, publisher and curator Mat Gleason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Red Pipe Gallery: Kaloust Guedel: Excess The New Norm|url=http://www.artslant.com/la/events/show/353832-excess-the-new-norm|publisher=ArtSlant|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Fantasy}}
'''Fantastic art''' is a broad and loosely defined [[art]] [[genre]].&lt;ref name="jahsonic" /&gt; It is not restricted to a specific school of artists, geographical location or historical period.  It can be characterised by subject matter – which portrays non-realistic, mystical, [[mythical]] or [[folklore|folkloric]] subjects or events – and style, which is representational and naturalistic, rather than abstract - or in the case of magazine illustrations and similar, in the style of [[graphic novel]] art such as [[manga]].

Fantasy has been an integral part of art since its beginnings,&lt;ref name="Schurian"/&gt; but has been particularly important in [[mannerism]], [[magic realism|magic realist]] painting, [[romantic art]], [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], [[surrealism]] and [[lowbrow (art movement)|lowbrow]]. In French, the genre is called le [[fantastique]], in English it is sometimes referred to as ''visionary art'', ''grotesque art'' or [[mannerism|mannerist art]]. It has had a deep and circular interaction with [[fantasy literature]].

The subject matter of Fantastic Art may resemble the product of hallucinations, and Fantastic artist [[Richard Dadd]] spent much of his life in mental institutions.  [[Salvador Dalí]] famously said: "the only difference between me and a madman is that I am not mad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=thinkexist.com |url=http://thinkexist.com/quotation/the_only_difference_between_me_and_a_madman_is/175604.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130804105007/http://thinkexist.com/quotation/the_only_difference_between_me_and_a_madman_is/175604.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 August 2013 |accessdate=4 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some recent Fantastic Art draws on the artist's experience, or purported experience, of [[hallucinogenic drugs]].

The term '''Fantasy Art''' is closely related, and is applied primarily to recent art (typically 20th century onwards) inspired by, or illustrating, fantasy literature.  The term has acquired some pejorative overtones.

Fantastic art has traditionally been largely confined to painting and illustration, but since the 1970s has increasingly been found also in photography. Fantastic art explores fantasy, imagination, the dream state, the [[grotesque]], visions and the uncanny,&lt;ref name="Schurian"&gt;Schurian, Walter (2005) Beyond Mere Understanding. In: ''Fantastic Art'', Schurian, W. &amp; Grosenick, U. (Ed.), [[Taschen]], p.6-25. {{ISBN|978-3-8228-2954-7}} (English edition)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as so-called "[[Goth]]" art.

==Related genres==
{{Speculative fiction|cTopic=Fantasy fiction}}
Genres which may also be considered as Fantastic Art include the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] of the [[Victorian era]], and [[Surrealism]].  Works based on classical mythology, which have been a staple of European art from the [[Renaissance]] period, also arguably meet the definition of Fantastic Art, as art based on modern mythology such as [[JRR Tolkien]]'s [[Middle Earth]] mythos unquestionably does.  [[Religious art]] also depicts supernatural or miraculous subjects in a naturalistic way, but is not generally regarded as Fantastic Art.

== Historic artists and fine artists ==
Many artists have produced works which fit the definition of fantastic art.  Some, such as [[Nicholas Roerich]], worked almost exclusively in the genre, others such as [[Hieronymus Bosch]], who has been described as the first "fantastic" artist in the Western tradition,&lt;ref name="Schurian"/&gt;  produced works both with and without fantastic elements, and for artists such as [[Francisco de Goya]], fantastic works were only a small part of their output.  Others again such as [[René Magritte]] are usually classed as Surrealists but use fantastic elements in their work. It is therefore impossible to give an exhaustive list of fantastic artists, but a selection of major and influential figures is listed below.&lt;ref name=jahsonic&gt;{{cite web|title=Jahsonic, a vocabulary of culture|url=http://www.jahsonic.com/FantasticArt.html|accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=David (ed.)|title=Fantastic Art|year=1973|publisher=Pan Ballantine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twentieth century==
The rise of [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] "pulp" magazines demanded artwork to illustrate stories and (via cover art) to promote sales.  This led to a movement of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] artists prior to and during the Great Depression, as anthologised by [[Vincent Di Fate]], himself a prolific SF and [[space]] artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Di Fato|first=Vincent|title=Infinite Worlds: The Fantastic Visions of Science Fiction Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States in the 1930s, a group of Wisconsin artists inspired by the Surrealist movement of Europe created their own brand of fantastic art. They included [[Madison, Wisconsin]]-based artists Marshall Glasier, Dudley Huppler and [[John Wilde]]; Karl Priebe of [[Milwaukee]] and [[Gertrude Abercrombie]] of [[Chicago]]. Their art combined macabre humor, mystery and irony &lt;ref&gt;Sara Krajewski, “Surreal Wisconsin: Surrealism and its Legacy of Wisconsin Art,” Madison Art Center, 1998  http://members.aol.com/MenuBar/surreal/surreal.htm accessed 3/26/2003&lt;/ref&gt; which was in direct and pointed contradiction to the [[American Regionalism]] then in vogue.

In postwar [[Chicago]], the art movement [[Chicago Imagism]] produced many fantastic and grotesque paintings, which were little noted because they did not conform to New York [[abstract art]] fashions of the time.  Major imagists include [[Roger Brown (artist)|Roger Brown]], [[Gladys Nilsson]], [[Jim Nutt]], [[Ed Paschke]], and [[Karl Wirsum]].&lt;ref name=Vine&gt;Richard Vine, "Where the Wild Things Were", ''[[Art in America]]'', May 1997, pp. 98-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-European Art==
Non-European art may contain fantastic elements, although it is not necessarily easy to separate them from religious elements involving supernatural beings and miraculous events.

The Foundation holds the world's largest collection of Giacometti's works: 95 paintings, 260 bronze sculptures, 550 plaster sculptures, and thousands of drawings and engravings. The Foundation also holds a large archive giving background to the artist's creations: numerous notebooks and sketchbooks, manuscripts for published texts, correspondence with other artists and intellectuals, as well as a large part of his private library, including reviews, books, exhibition catalogues, and newspapers, some of which have his annotations or drawings. It aims at establishing a comprehensive catalogue of the artist's works from the records started by his widow. It also organises exhibitions of works from its collection, and provides short and long-term loans to major museums and cultural institutions. The premises housing the collection are not open to the general public, however the entire collection is progressively being made available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-giacometti.fr/the-alberto-giacometti-database.html|title=Alberto Giacometti Database|date=|accessdate=13 November 2011|language=English, French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Foundation is the sole beneficiary of the legacy of Annette Giacometti, his widow, deceased in 1993. Mrs. Giacometti appointed [[Roland Dumas]], a lawyer and former French foreign minister, to be her executor. By the time Annette Giacometti died, the French Government had not yet approved creation of the foundation. In 1994, reportedly to cover the cost of storage, insurance and legal fees, Dumas put 18 Giacometti works up for sale through the French auctioneer Jacques Tajan, raising the equivalent of some $8 million.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Riding (September 24, 2002), [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/24/arts/for-sale-maybe-giacometti-s-legacy-a-proposed-auction-draws-fire-in-paris.html For Sale (Maybe): Giacometti's Legacy; A Proposed Auction Draws Fire in Paris] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 Mrs. Giacometti's brother, Michael Arm, asked a Paris court to annul his sister's will, prepared in January 1990, arguing that she was mentally incompetent at the time. In May 2007, Dumas received a 12-month jail sentence (suspended) for funds he mis-appropriated acting as executor of the will of Annette Giacometti.

== Administration and implementation ==
The Foundation is administered by a nine-member board, including two French Government representatives (statutory members: the [[Ministry of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]] and the [[Ministry of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture and Communication]] and a member of the Fondation Alberto Giacometti at [[Zürich]] (Alberto Giacometti-Stiftung). 
== Mission ==
The Foundation has a mission to protect, disseminate and promote Giacommetti's works. Its activities include:
* Public display of works:
Holding a collection of over 5,000 works, the Foundation participates in many cultural activities, lectures, themed exhibitions, and conferences in cultural institutions around the world. It is involved in the publication, reproduction and editing of Alberto Giacometti's work.
* Conservation of the Alberto et Annette Giacometti archives
* Cataloguing the works
* Awards and scholarships
* Protection of the works both in France and abroad:
For this purpose, it monitors related publications, exhibitions and sales, and the sale of counterfeit works, attempting to remove them from the market and pursue the counterfeiters. It grants permission to display, edit and publish Giacometti's works. The foundation, in conjunction with members of Giacometti's family, has the right to produce new sculptures from the original plaster casts, completing the editions he began. Under French law, an artist or his heirs have the right to cast no more than 12 sculptures that are to be considered authentic. Giacometti cast most of his sculptures in editions of 6 and occasionally 8.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel (September 15, 2006), [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/15/arts/design/15voge.html  The Giacometti Foundation Selects a Partner] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[filmmaking]], '''found footage''' is the use of [[footage]] as a [[found object]], appropriated for use in [[collage film]]s, [[documentary film]]s, [[mockumentary film]]s and other works.

==Use in commercial film==
Historical found footage is often used in documentary films as a source of primary information, giving the viewer a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.  Director and cinematographer [[Ken Burns]] used archival footage in his films. ''[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]]'' (1994), his documentary television series for PBS, incorporates historical footage accompanied by original music or actors reading relevant written documents.

Often fictional films imitate this style in order to increase their authenticity, especially the mockumentary genre. In the dramatized and embellished pseudo-documentary film ''[[F For Fake]]'' &lt;!-- Year of release in Europe. --&gt;(1973), director [[Orson Welles]] borrows all shots of main subject [[Elmyr de Hory]] from a BBC documentary,&lt;ref name="f for fake"&gt;{{cite web |last=Null |first=Christopher |title=F for Fake |publisher=filmcritic.com |date=12 February 2005 |accessdate=23 March 2011 |url=http://www.filmcritic.com/reviews/1976/f-for-fake/?OpenDocument }}&lt;/ref&gt;  rather than fabricating the footage himself.

Stuart Cooper's ''[[Overlord (1975 film)|Overlord]]'' uses stock footage of the landing on Normandy during [[World War II]] to increase realism. The footage was obtained from the [[Imperial War Museum]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criterion.com/asp/release.asp?id=382 The Criterion Collection: Overlord by Stuart Cooper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other parts of the film were shot by Cooper, but using old World War II-era film stock with World War II-era [[camera lens|lens]]es.

==Music video and VJing==
A certain style of [[music video]] makes extensive use of found footage, mostly found on TV, like news, documentaries, old (and odd) films etc. Prominent examples are videos of bands such as [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] and [[Coldcut]]. The latter also project video material during their stage show, which includes live mixing of video footage. Artists such as Vicki Bennett, also known as [[People Like Us (musician)|People Like Us]], or the video artist Kasumi with the film Shockwaves, use [[Creative Commons]] archives such as the [[Prelinger Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Shiels, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/new_media/2062364.stm ''Unlocking the copyright culture''], BBC News website, June 24, 2002.

'''''Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball''''' is a multiplatform [[baseball]] [[simulation game]] that was licensed by the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]], featuring the likeness, [[motion capture]]d movements, and "Big Hurt" branding of player [[Frank Thomas (designated hitter)|Frank Thomas]].

All the teams, statistics, and players are meant to simulate the [[1995 Major League Baseball season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12182| title = Basic game summary | publisher = [[allgame]] | date = | accessdate = 2011-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acclaim released a successor to the game also featuring Thomas and now featuring actual major league teams, ''[[All-Star Baseball]] '97 Featuring Frank Thomas''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:FrankThomasBigHurtBaseballScreenshotSNES.PNG|225px|left|thumb|In this screenshot, the batter sends the ball flying far away. On the scoreboard, there is also an endorsement for the athletic shoe company ''[[Reebok]]''.]]

Featuring realistic pitching, realistic batting, and a realistic likeness of Frank Thomas himself for the game's era, there are also regular season and exhibition modes.&lt;ref name="mobygames"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/frank-thomas-big-hurt-baseball| title = Overview of ''Frank Thomas' Big Hurt Baseball'' | publisher = [[MobyGames]] | date = | accessdate = 2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitching and batting can be done either in a high, medium, or low direction (in addition to slow, medium, or fast pitching) for greater realism.&lt;ref name="mobygames"/&gt; Greater emphasis was placed on defense and pitching, as opposed to more offense-oriented baseball video games like ''[[World Series Baseball '95]]''. Games often take place at night; especially at [[Wrigley Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.34thdimension.com/articles/110-frank-thomas-quotbig-hurtquot-baseball-review-genesis.html| title = Defense/pitching/aesthetics information | publisher = 34th Dimension | date = | accessdate = 2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Games can be played to a minimum of two innings and a maximum of nine innings (plus any extra innings that occur in a tied game). All the teams in the game can be edited through a special edit screen; this allows players to replace teams that they don't like with their home towns (that don't have Major League Baseball teams).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.giantbomb.com/profile/killerjt/frank-thomas-big-hurt-baseball-snes/52-105175/img_0005/51-337847/| title = "Edit team name" mode information | publisher = Giant Bomb | date = | accessdate = 2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 700 players with Major League Baseball contracts appeared in the game.

==Development==
Frank Thomas's animations in the game were created from several days of [[motion capture]] filming Thomas at Acclaim's in-house studio during Spring 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Hooray for Hollywood!

== Release ==
A conversion of the game was in development for the [[Atari Jaguar CD]] after [[Atari Corporation]] and Acclaim announced their partnership in March 1995 that included plans to release three titles for the system, including ''Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball''.&lt;ref name="FTBHBaj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://host.fptoday.com/melek/Jaguar/jag-95.htm|title=ATARI AND ACCLAIM JOIN FORCES IN MAJOR SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT|website=Nine Lives|date=March 22, 1995|accessdate=2018-09-22|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041214015334/http://host.fptoday.com/melek/Jaguar/jag-95.htm|archivedate=14 December 2004|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=http://oldgamemags.ukprintarchive.com/Multi-format%20Publications/Computer%20&amp;%20Video%20Games/CVG%20(1995-06)%20163%20(EMAP).pdf/#page/12|title=CVG News - Atari's Cat Gets The CD Cream - Big Cat Claws EA Deal|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|issue=163|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|date=June 1995|pages=12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/stream/GamePro_Issue_071_June_1995#page/n150/mode/1up|title=ProNews: At the Deadline|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=71|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1995|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=http://retrosprite.proboards.com/post/34/thread|title=Acclaim join Atari for a bit of a Jag 'n' Jam|magazine=[[Future plc|Ultimate Future Games]]|issue=7|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|date=June 1995|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=http://oldgamemags.ukprintarchive.com/Multi-format%20Publications/Edge/Supplements/Suppl-Edge-022.pdf|title=Jaguar: mass market machine|magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|issue=22 Supplement|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|date=July 1995|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vendel|first=Curt|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/jaguar/jagfiles/jag64-payments.PDF|title=Payment Schedule for Jaguar games to Developers|website=atarimuseum.com|format=PDF|date=August 26, 1995|accessdate=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The port was originally slated to be release around the fourth quarter of 1995 and was later slated for an April/Q2 1996 release,&lt;ref name="FTBHBaj"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MANIAC.N020.1995.06/MANIAC.N020.1995.06-DURiAN_Searchable#page/n39/mode/1up|title=Feature - XT Generation Report - Atari Jaguar|magazine=[[:de:M!

Reviewing the Genesis version, Videohead of ''[[GamePro]]'' said the game has "nothing awful", but is also short on exceptional features. He praised the animation but criticized the slow-moving fielders, inauthentic representations of real world ballparks, "jagged" voice tracks, and graphical glitches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Frank Thomas 'Big Hurt' Baseball Faces Big Injury|magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=88 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1996|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air Hendrix reviewed the Super NES version and was more negative: "Watching [[Little League]] players would be more exciting than struggling with Big Hurt's shoddy controls, scant features, and no-brainer action." He also criticized how tightly the camera follows the ball during fielding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Frank Thomas 'Big Hurt' Baseball |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=89 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=February 1996|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]''{{'}}s brief review of the Super NES version stated, "Combing simulation aspects with a traditional baseball game, ''Frank Thomas' Big Hurt Baseball'' shows signs of innovative but flawed thinking. Most of the simulation aspects are in the pitching, which quickly becomes a tiresome chore. The rest of the game is a sub-par replica of several other baseball titles."&lt;ref name="NGen13"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Frank Thomas' Big Hurt Baseball|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=13 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1996|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two sports reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' both gave the PlayStation version a 7.5 out of 10. They remarked that the attention to detail in the stadium sounds and visuals make the game very realistic, and that while the control is somewhat "sluggish", it works well once learned.&lt;ref name="EGM85"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=|first= |title=Big Hurt Baseball |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=85|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=August 1996 |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''GamePro''{{'}}s Scary Larry said that the motion-captured animation is excellent, but that against other PlayStation baseball games such as ''[[Triple Play 97]]'', ''Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball'' doesn't hold up well due to the lack of key options such as changing the batter's stance and speed bursts while running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=96|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=September 1996|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave a more positive recommendation for the Saturn version, while noting that he only did so because the Saturn did not have as many outstanding baseball games as the PlayStation yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Big Hurt Makes Big Dent on Saturn|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=96|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=September 1996|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''GamePro'' and ''Next Generation'' found the Saturn version a major improvement over the Super NES version, with ''Next Generation'' calling it "an extremely solid game with little flaws that keep it from being great." The reviewer called the graphics "extraordinary", while his criticisms included the somewhat difficult interface and the delay in the batting controls.&lt;ref name="NGen21"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first= |title=Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=21 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=September 1996|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Allsetter of the British ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' chiefly commented on baseball's lack of mass appeal in Britain, and argued that though ''Big Hurt'' is good by the standards of a baseball video game it would only appeal to those who are fans of the sport.&lt;ref name="SatMag9"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Allsetter |first=Rob |title=Review: Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=9|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=July 1996|pages=68-69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''GamePro'' gave the Game Boy version a brief negative review, commenting that "The graphics make hitting a nightmare. When the ball is on its way, it gets lost in the green background. Every swing of the bat sounds like a skier slushing down the slopes." They were much more approving of the Game Gear version, saying it "offer smooth gameplay and excellent control along with such options as Season and All Star games."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Frank Thomas "Big Hurt" Baseball|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=91|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1996|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:futakuchi-onna.jpg|thumb|250px|An image of a futakuchi-onna from the [[Ehon Hyaku Monogatari]]]]
A {{nihongo|'''futakuchi-onna'''|二口女||lit. "two-mouthed woman"}} is a type of [[yōkai]] or Japanese [[monster]].  They are characterized by their two [[mouth]]s – a normal one located on her face and second one on the back of the [[head]] beneath the [[hair]]. There, the woman's [[human skull|skull]] splits apart, forming lips, [[teeth]] and a [[tongue]], creating an entirely functional second mouth.

In [[Japanese mythology]] and [[kaidan|folklore]], the futakuchi-onna belongs to the same class of stories as the [[rokurokubi]], [[kuchisake-onna]] and the [[yama-uba]], women afflicted with a [[curse]] or [[supernatural]] [[disease]] that transforms them into yōkai.  The supernatural nature of the women in these stories is usually concealed until the last minute, when the true self is revealed.

==Origins of the second mouth==
The origin of a futakuchi-onna's second [[mouth]] is often linked to how little a woman eats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227233426/http://www.youkaimura.org/futaku.htm|title=Wayback Machine|date=27 February 2007|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many stories, the soon-to-be futakuchi-onna is a wife of a [[miser]] and rarely eats. To counteract this, a second mouth mysteriously appears on the back of the woman's head. The second mouth often mumbles spiteful and threatening things to the woman and demands food. If it is not fed, it can screech obscenely and cause the woman tremendous pain. Eventually, the woman's hair begins to move like a pair of [[Snake|serpents]], allowing the mouth to help itself to the woman's meals. While no food passes through her normal lips, the mouth in the back of her head consumes twice what the other one would. In another story, the extra mouth is formed when a stingy woman is accidentally hit in the head by her husband's [[axe]] while he is chopping wood, and the wound never heals. Other stories have the woman as a mother who lets her stepchild die of [[starvation]] while keeping her own offspring well fed; presumably, the [[spirit]] of the neglected child lodges itself in the stepmother's or the surviving daughter's body to exact [[revenge]].

==Prototypical story==
This is the most famous and prototypical story of a futakuchi-onna:

In a small village there lived a stingy miser who, because he could not bear the expense of paying for food for a wife, lived entirely by himself.

One day he met a woman who did not eat anything, whom he immediately took for his wife. Because she never ate a thing, and was still a hard worker, the old miser was extraordinarily thrilled with her, but on the other hand he began to wonder why his stores of rice were steadily decreasing.

One day the man pretended to leave for work, but instead stayed behind to spy on his new wife. To his horror, he saw his wife’s hair part on the back of her head, her skull split wide revealing a gaping mouth. She unbound her hair, which reached out like tentacles to grasp the rice and shovel it into the hungry mouth.

==In popular culture==
{{Pop culture|date=April 2018}}
* In the manga ''[[Gantz]]'' a creature that has the characteristics of both the Futakuhi-onna and the [[Rokurokubi]] (i.e. second mouth on the back of the head and the ability to elongate the neck) is seen in later chapters of the series albeit briefly. It is not stated if this is another variation of the creature or a way to feature both at the same time.
* The long running anime series ''[[GeGeGe No Kitaro]]'' often features Futakuchi-onna as an antagonist to Kitaro. Her skin is a pale white with raven black hair which can form snake-like ropes that stretch out and snare victims, often to pull them towards her horrifically large mouth on the back of her head which has sharp teeth. She is also known to work with other [[Yōkai]] antagonists [[Kamaitachi]] and [[Tantanbō]].
* The 2005 movie ''[[The Great Yokai War]]'' briefly features a futakuchi-onna.
* In the [[video game]] ''[[The Last Blade]]'', the character [[List of The Last Blade characters#Akari Ichijou|Akari Ichijou]] uses various attacks that involve [[yōkai]]. One of them is a special move that summons "a hundred yōkai" that parade across the screen in a procession. A futakuchi-onna is featured in this procession.
* ''[[Samurai Sentai Shinkenger]]'' and ''[[Power Rangers Samurai]]'' villain [[Gedoushu|Tayu Usukawa]] is themed after the Futakuchi-onna.
* In ''[[Shuriken Sentai Ninninger]]'', one of the "Monster of the Fortnight" Youkai the Ninningers fought was a Futakuchi-onna.
* The television horror anthology series ''[[Masters of Horror]]'' featured a creature similar to a futakuchi-onna as a main character in the episode ''Imprint''.
* The [[Pokémon]] [[List of Pokémon (252–319)#Mawile|Mawile]] is based on the futakuchi-onna.
* The comic ''[[Eerie Cuties]]'' featured a Futakuchi-onna as a history teacher.
* The adult-oriented strategy game ''[[Sengoku Rance]]'' features a female [[ninja]] character named "Orime" who is based on the Futakuchi-onna.
* In the [[video game]] ''[[The Secret World]]'', the Futakuchi-onna is a rare enemy located in Tokyo.
* In ''[[Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children]]'' and its [[Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (film)|film adaption]], the character named Claire Densmore is inspired by the Futakuchi-onna where she has a mouth with sharp teeth that is covered by her curly hair which she mostly eats with.
* In the [[video game]] ''[[Skullgirls]]'', the location of the parasite Samson on Filia gives her the appearance of a futakuchi-onna.
* In the mobile game ''[[Onmyoji]]'', Futakuchi-onna is a shikigami with two huge arms on her head that resembles pigtails.
*In the upcoming videogame [[Mamono]] (a [[Pokémon]]-inspired RPG game) the futakuchi-onna is one of the trainable monster girls.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8481">'''Geocriticism''' is a method of [[literary analysis]] and [[literary theory]] that incorporates the study of geographic space. The term designates a number of different critical practices.  In France, [[Bertrand Westphal]] has elaborated the concept of ''géocritique'' in several works.&lt;ref&gt;See Westphal, ''La Géocritique, Réel, Fiction, Espace'', Paris, Éditions de Minuit, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, [[Robert Tally]] has argued for a geocriticism as a critical practice suited to the analysis of what he has termed "literary cartography".&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Tally's "Geocriticism and Classic American Literature" and ''Spatiality''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Some of the first expressly ''geocritical'' writings emerged from symposia organized by  Westphal at the [[University of Limoges]]. Westphal's foundational essay, "Pour une approche géocritique des textes"&lt;ref&gt;Available in French online at http://www.vox-poetica.net/sflgc/biblio/gcr.html&lt;/ref&gt; constitutes a [[manifesto]] for geocriticism.  Westphal's theory is elaborated in greater detail in his ''Geocriticism: Real and Fictional Spaces'', translated by Tally, who also provides a brief introduction.  But there are also many works addressing similar themes and using similar methods that might be considered geocritical, even if the term "geocriticism" is not used.

== Theory ==
In Westphal's theory, geocriticism is based on three theoretical concepts: spatio-temporality, transgressivity, and referentiality. 

The idea that space and time form a continuum ([[space-time]]) is a tenet of modern physics. In the field of literary theory, geocriticism is an interdisciplinary method of literary analysis that focuses not only on such temporal data as relations between the life and times of the author (as in biographical criticism), the history of the text (as in [[textual criticism]]), or the story (as studied by [[narratology]]), but also on spatial data. Geocriticism therefore has affinities with geography, architecture, urban studies, and so on; it also correlates to philosophical concepts such as [[deterritorialization]].
 
Following the work of [[Michel Foucault]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Henri Lefebvre]] and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], among others, a geocritical approach to literature recognizes that representations of space are often transgressive, crossing the boundaries of established norms while also reestablishing new relations among people, places, and things. Cartography is no longer seen as the exclusive province of the state or the government; rather, various agents or groups may be responsible for representing the geographic spaces at the same time and with different effects. In practice, therefore, geocriticism is multifocal, examining a variety of topics at once, thus differentiating itself from practices that focus on the singular point of view of the traveler or protagonist. 

Geocriticism also assumes a literary referentiality between world and text, or, in other words, between the referent and its representation. By questioning the relations between a given space's nature and its actually existing condition, the geocritical approach allows for a study of fiction that points also to the theory of possible worlds, such as may be seen in the work on third space by the American geographer [[Edward Soja]] (''Thirdspace''). Tally's book ''Spatiality'', an introduction to spatiality studies in literature and critical theory, includes a chapter on geocriticism.

== Critical practices ==
Geocriticism frequently involves the study of places described in the literature by various authors, but it can also study the effects of literary representations of a given space. An example of the range of geocritical practices can be found in Tally's collection ''Geocritical Explorations: Space, Place, and Mapping in Literary and Cultural Studies''.

Geocriticism derives some of its practices from precursors whose theoretical work helped establish space as a valid topic for literary analysis.  For example, in ''The Poetics of Space'' and elsewhere, Gaston Bachelard studied literary works to develop a typology of places according to their connotations. Maurice Blanchot's writings have legitimized the idea of literary space, an imaginary place for the creation of the work of literature. One might also look at the developments of cultural studies and especially postcolonial studies, such as [[Raymond Williams]]'s ''The Country and the City'' or [[Edward Said]]'s ''Culture and Imperialism'', which employ what Said has called a "geographical inquiry into historical experience."&lt;ref&gt;Said, ''Culture and Imperialism'', p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fredric Jameson]]'s concept of cognitive mapping and his theoretical engagement with the postmodern condition also highlight the importance of spatial representation and aesthetic productions, including literature, film, architecture, and design.  In ''The Atlas of European Novel, 1800-1900'', [[Franco Moretti]] has examined the diffusion of literary spaces in Europe, focusing on the complex relationship between the text and space. Moretti has also promulgated a theory of literary history, or literary geography, that would use maps to bring to light new connections between the texts studied and their social spaces.&lt;ref&gt;See Moretti, ''Graphs, Maps, Trees''.&lt;/ref&gt;  And, in his study of Herman Melville's literary cartography, Robert Tally has offered a geocritical approach to certain texts.&lt;ref&gt;See Tally, ''Melville, Mapping and Globalization''.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Geocriticism has intellectual and methodological affiliations with such fields as Literature and the Environment or [[ecocriticism]], regional literature, urban studies, sociological and philosophical approaches to literature, and utopian studies.

'''Georgine''' is a women’s [[ready-to-wear]] brand founded by the designers Georgine Ratelband and Chris Roshia in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Designer to Watch: GEORGINE’s Georgine Ratelband|url=http://www.thefashionspot.com/runway-news/318363-simply-chic-simply-georgine/#/slide/1|accessdate=19 August 2018|work=theFashionSpot|date=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="suitcasemag"/&gt;

== History ==
Georgine was launched by the fashion designer Georgine Ratelband with her partner Chris Roshia and was founded in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Georgine Ratelband and Chris Roshia - SCAD.edu|url=https://www.scad.edu/content/georgine-ratelband-and-chris-roshia|accessdate=19 August 2018|work=[[Savannah College of Art and Design]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before completing her graduation from [[Istituto Europeo di Design]] in 2011, thesis-collection of Georgine was acquired by a boutique in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter"/&gt; Georgine was presented at [[New York Fashion Week]], and their designs have rated the pages of [[Women’s Wear Daily]], [[W Magazine]] and [[Vogue Italia]].&lt;ref name="suitcasemag"&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=PWhat’s in Your Suitcase, Georgine Ratelband|url=https://suitcasemag.com/fashion/global-style/whats-in-your-suitcase-georgine-ratelband/|accessdate=19 August 2018|work=[[Suitcase]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly following the launch of the brand Ratelband was surprised to discover that [[Beyoncé]] wore one of her pieces on the red carpet during her Husband [[Jay-Z]]’s Tidal X Event at Brooklyn’s [[Barclays Center]]. Since then Georgine has dressed numerous celebrities including: [[Lady Gaga]], [[Zendaya]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Cardi B]], [[Demi Moore]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Bella Hadid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chistian |first1=Allaire|title=Battle of the Power Jackets: Bella Hadid vs. Gigi Hadid|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/bella-hadid-gigi-hadid-sisters-style-jackets|accessdate=19 August 2018|work=[[Vogue (British magazine)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lena Dunham]], The Kardashian’s, Tracey Ellis Ross, [[Mariah Carey]], [[Patina Miller]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Patina Miller Wearing Georgine - Georgine Front Row New York Fashion Week|url=http://www.luxurycheckout.com/blog/patina-miller-wearing-georgine-georgine-front-row-new-york-fashion-week/|accessdate=19 August 2018|work=LuxuryCheckout}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Gilles]], [[Sarah Rafferty]], Victoria Secret Model’s; [[Rosie Huntington-Whiteley]], [[Romee Strijd]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nyquist|first1=Katja|title=Bella Hadid Wearing GEORGINE During Paris Fashion Week|url=https://trendprivemagazine.com/2018/03/06/bella-hadid-wearing-georgine-paris-fashion-week/|accessdate=19 August 2018|work=Trend Prive Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter"/&gt;

The '''Golden Sun Bird''' ({{zh|s=太阳神鸟金饰|t=太陽神鳥金飾|p=Tàiyáng Shénniǎo Jīnshì}}) is an ancient [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], unearthed in 2001 from the [[Jinsha (archaeological site)|Jinsha Ruins]] in [[Chengdu]] City, [[Sichuan]] Province, [[People's Republic of China|China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=unknown |url=http://www.chinese-treasures.net/node/54 |title=Gold Sunbird |publisher=Chinese Treasures |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a ring-shaped piece of foil, made of nearly pure [[gold]]. The pattern consists of four [[birds]], flying in the same [[counterclockwise]] direction, located around the perimeter. The center is a sun pattern with twelve points. It is 12.5&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter, with a 5.29&amp;nbsp;cm inner diameter. It has a thickness of 0.02&amp;nbsp;cm, and weighs 20 grams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/chinanews/2005-08/16/content_4918640_1.htm |title=:: 新华网 :: - 地方联播 |publisher=Xinhuanet.com |date=2005-08-16 |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece is from the late [[Sanxingdui]] culture, and is now located in the [[Chengdu Jinsha Ruins Museum]].

==Logo==

In 2011, the city of Chengdu selected the Golden Sun Bird as the design for its logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://news.ifeng.com/mainland/detail_2011_12/31/11688105_0.shtml |title= Chengdu Unveils its New City Logo |publisher= news.ifeng.com  |date=2011-12-30 |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2221">The '''''Kokka Taikan''''' (国歌大観) is a compilation encyclopedia of Japanese [[Waka (poetry)|waka]] poetry early and modern, also serving as the ''de facto'' academic indexing system for poetry about which little is known. It is published by '''[[Kadokawa Group Holdings|Kadokawa Gakugei Shuppan]]'''.

In academic literature or [[literary criticism]], the ''Kokka taikan'' reference number is more likely to be provided for poems by unknown or anonymous authors or when the year or location is unknown. For example, where records of [[poetry competition]]s in notable households are harvested, only a period and the location may be known; these poems may be valuable if referenced by masterpieces from the same or rival [[literary group]].

==Compilation and extent==
The 2012 2nd edition of the ''Kokka Taikan'' comprises over 450,000 [[Waka (poetry)|Japanese]] and [[Chinese poetry|Chinese poems]].&lt;ref&gt;Kadokawa [http://www.kadokawa.co.jp/sp/201211-06/ ''Kokka taikan'' DVD-ROM page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original encyclopedia, encompassing only Japanese poetry, was compiled by Matsushita Daisaburo and Fumio Watanabe and published between 1901 and 1903. Continuation volumes were published between 1925 and 1926. The reference numbers for these volumes continued in sequence but are marked in referencing with ''zoku Kokka taikan''. The encyclopedia was published by Kadokawa from 1983.

The current 2nd edition, published in 2012, is expanded with reference number continuing in sequence and is available on DVD-ROM.

==Other collections==
More long established collections can be seen as coherently delimited collections. The ''Kokka taikan'' can be viewed as the miscellany, aiming to contain poetry outside the long established collections:
* [[Man'yōshū]]: the very ancient Japanese poetry collated during the [[Nara period]].
* [[Monogatari]]: the 40 or so longer tales that survive from the [[Heian period|Heian]] and [[Kamakura period]]s.
* [[Nijūichidaishū]]: the 21 imperial anthologies of Japanese court poetry.

'''Kolormondo''' is a [[Color model|colour system]], presenting [[Color|colours]] and their interrelations in [[three-dimensional space|three dimensions]]. The Kolormondo system is used to understand, identify and communicate colours. Kolormondo is a patent pending Swedish innovation. The founder of Kolormondo, Nicoline Kinch, has received the Inventors Prize of the city of Stockholm.

== Colours in 3D ==
Kolormondo is displayed as a 3D Colour Puzzle and as a digital 3D Colour [[Globe]]. The Kolormondo 3D Colour Puzzle is based on [[CMYK color model|CMYK]], [[Cyan|Cyan (C)]], [[Magenta|Magenta (M)]], [[Yellow|Yellow (Y)]] and on [[Black|Black (K)]]. These are [[Pigment|pigment based colours]], which are used on printed media. Kolormondo´s digital colour globe is built with [[RGB color model|RGB]], [[Red|Red (R)]], [[Green|Green (G)]] and [[Blue|Blue (B)]]. These are light colours and are used on the screen.

The Kolormondo system is three-dimensional displayed as a globe. At the [[Equator]], you find the most pure [[hue]]s, those that constitute the [[Color wheel|colour circle]]. The North Pole is white while the South Pole is black. The closer you get to the white North Pole the lighter the colours become. If you go south towards the black South Pole the colours get darker. Towards the globe’s core, colours gradually turn grey. A pillar or a column between the North and the South Pole is the grey scale.

Kolormondo invites you to systematically navigate between colours and explore how they blend into each other. The gradual change from any given colour in/out to its less/more [[saturation (color theory)|saturated]] “relative” colour is clear as well as the change in value going up for a lighter version or down for a more black. You can see how apricot turns into orange, transforms into brown when following colours along the sphere’s longitude; while the same brown turned into purple in one direction along the latitude, and into dark green going the other way.

{{Culture of Korea}}

'''Korean architecture''' refers to the [[built environment]] of [[Korea]] from c. 30,000 BC to the present.

==Introduction==
From a technical point of view, buildings are structured vertically and horizontally. A construction usually rises from a stone subfoundation to a curved roof covered with tiles, held by a console structure and supported on posts; walls are made of earth (adobe) or are sometimes totally composed of movable wooden doors. Architecture is built according to the k'a unit, the distance between two posts (about 3.7 meters), and is designed so that there is always a transitional space between the "inside" and the "outside."

The console, or bracket structure, is a specific architectonic element that has been designed in various ways through time. If the simple bracket system was already in use under the [[Goguryeo]] kingdom (37 BC – 668 AD)—in palaces in [[Pyongyang]], for instance—a curved version, with brackets placed only on the column heads of the building, was elaborated during the early Goryeo (Koryo) dynasty (918–1392). The Amita Hall of the Buseok temple in Yeongju is a good example. Later on (from the mid-Koryo period to the early [[Joseon dynasty]]), a multiple-bracket system, or an inter-columnar-bracket set system, was developed under the [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Han dynasty in China]] influence during the Mongolian [[Yuan dynasty]] (1279–1368). In this system, the consoles were also placed on the transverse horizontal beams. Seoul's Namdaemun Gate [[Namdaemun]], Korea's first national treasure, is perhaps the most symbolic example of this type of structure.

In the mid-Joseon period, the winglike bracket form appeared (an example is the Yongnyongjon Hall of [[Jongmyo]], Seoul), which, according to some authors, better suited the peninsula's poor economic situation that resulted from repetitive invasions. Only in buildings of importance like palaces or sometimes temples (Tongdosa, for instance) were the multicluster brackets still used. [[Korean Confucianism]] also led to more sober and simple solutions.

==Historical architecture==

===Prehistoric architecture===
[[File:Korea-Seoul-Amsadong-Neolithic.age-01.jpg|thumb|left|Reconstructed Neolithic-period huts in [[Amsa-dong]], [[Gangdong-gu]], [[Seoul]]]]
In the [[Prehistoric Korea|Paleolithic]] the first inhabitants of the Korean peninsula used caves, rockshelters, and portable shelters. The remains of a portable shelter dating to c. 30,000&amp;nbsp;BC were excavated at the Seokjang-ri site in South Chungcheong Province.&lt;ref name=Jipjari&gt;Jipjari [House]. In ''Hanguk Gogohak Sajeon'' [Dictionary of Korean Archaeology], edited by National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage, Seoul, 2001, pp.1130-1131.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest examples of [[pit-house]] [[architecture]] are from the [[Jeulmun Pottery Period]].&lt;ref name=Jipjari/&gt; Early pit-houses contained basic features such as hearths, storage pits, and space for working and sleeping.

Log houses were built by laying logs horizontally one on top of one another. The interstices between the logs were filled with clay to keep the wind out. Similar houses are still found in mountainous areas as like [[Gangwon-do (South Korea)|Gangwon-do]] province.&lt;ref name="asianinfo.org"/&gt;

Elevated houses, which probably originated in the southern regions, are believed to have first been built as storage houses to store grains out of the reach of animals and to keep them cool. This style still survives in the two-story pavilions and lookout stands erected in melon patches and orchards around the countryside.&lt;ref name="asianinfo.org"/&gt;

In the [[Mumun Pottery Period|Mumun period]] buildings were pit dwellings with walls of [[wattle-and-daub]] and [[Thatching|thatched roof]]s.&lt;ref name=Jipjari/&gt; Raised-floor architecture first appeared in the Korean peninsula in the Middle Mumun, c. 850–550&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=Jipjari/&gt;

[[Megaliths#Megalithic Traditions of Asia: the Korean Peninsula|Megaliths]], sometimes called [[dolmen]]s, are the burials of important and prestigious persons of the Mumun Pottery Period (1500–300&amp;nbsp;BC). They have been found in great numbers and along with stone-cist burials, megaliths and are the main examples of mortuary architecture in the Mumun. There are three types of megaliths: (1) the southern type, which is low and often a simple slab with supporting stones, (2) the northern type, which is larger and shaped much like a table, and (3) the capstone type, which has a capstone with no supporting stones. The distribution of the dolmens would imply some relation to other global [[megalithic]] cultures.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Proto–Three Kingdoms Period (c. 1st-2nd century BC to 3rd-4th century AD)===
[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence of [[ondol]]([[Hangul]]: 온돌), the Korean floor panel heating system, was found in the architectural remains of early [[Proto–Three Kingdoms|Protohistoric period]].&lt;ref name=Jipjari/&gt;

According to Chinese text [[Sanguo Zhi]], it recorded the existence of three types of prehistoric dwellings in Korea: pit houses, log houses and elevated houses. Only the remains of pit houses have been identified, however. Pit houses consisted of a 20–150&amp;nbsp;cm deep pit and a superstructure of grass and clay supported by a tripod-like frame made of timber to provide protection from the wind and rain. Pit houses of the Neolithic period had circular or oval pits about 5–6 meters in diameter with a hearth at the center. Most of the early ones were located on hills. As these dwellings moved down nearer to rivers, the pits became rectangular in shape as well as larger, with two separated hearths.&lt;ref name="asianinfo.org"&gt;http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/arc/prehistoric_period.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
In 108&amp;nbsp;BC, the [[China|Chinese]] commanderies was established after the destruction of [[Gojoseon]]. Official buildings of this period were built of wood and brick and roofed with tiles having the features of Chinese construction.

===Three Kingdoms Period (c. 3rd-4th century-668)===

====Common architecture====
In the Three Kingdoms Period, some people lived in pit-houses while others lived in raised-floor buildings. For example, the Hanseong ([[Hangul]]: 한성, 漢城; an eastern part of Seoul and western part of Hanam city in Gyeonggi Province) Baekje settlement of Seongdong-ri in Gyeonggi Province contained only pit-houses,&lt;ref&gt;Seongdong-ri Jibjari [The Seongdong-ri Settlement Site]. In ''Hanguk Gogohak Sajeon'' [Dictionary of Korean Archaeology], edited by National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage, Seoul, 2001, pp. 652-653.&lt;/ref&gt; while the Silla settlement of Siji-dong in [[Daegu|Greater Daegu]] contained only raised-floor architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Siji-dong Yujeok [The Siji-dong Site]. In ''Hanguk Gogohak Sajeon'' [Dictionary of Korean Archaeology], edited by National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage, Seoul, 2001, pp. 749-751.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fortress architecture====
{{main article|Korean fortress}}
[[Goguryeo]], the largest kingdom among the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], is renowned for its mountain fortresses built horizontally and vertically along the incline of slopes. One of the well-preserved Goguryeo fortresses is Baekam fortress (白巖城) constructed before 6th century in present-day South-West Manchuria. A Chinese historian noted, "The Goguryeo people like to build their palaces well." Patterned tiles and ornate bracket systems were already in use in many palaces in Pyongyang, the capital, and other town-fortresses in what now is [[Manchuria]].

The construction of Buddhist temples was undertaken after Buddhism was introduced in 372 by way of northern China. A series of excavations in 1936-1938 unearthed the sites of several major temples near Pyongyang, including those in Cheongam-ri, Wono-ri and Sango-ri. The excavations disclosed that the temples were built in a Goguryeo style known as "three Halls-one Pagoda," with each hall in the east, west and north, and an entrance gate in the south. In most cases, the central pagodas had an octagonal plan. Palace buildings appear to have been arranged in this way as well.

[[Baekje]] was founded in 18 BC and its territory included the west coast of the Korean peninsula. After the fall of Nangnang County under the Han dynasty in China, Baekje established friendships with China and Japan. Great temples were built during this time. The earliest stone [[pagoda]] of the [[Mireuksa]] Temple in [[Iksan]] county is of particular interest because it shows the transitional features from a wooden pagoda to a stone one. Baekje assimilated diverse influences and expressed its derivation from Chinese models. Later, important elements of the architectural style of Baekje were adopted by Japan.

Baekje was heavily influenced by Goguryeo because the first King Onjo of Baekje was a son of the Goguryeo's first king Go Ju-mong as well as by southern China. As it expanded southward, moving its capital to Ungjin (current Gongju) in 475 and to Sabi (current Buyeo) in 538, its arts became richer and more refined than that of Goguryeo. Also characteristic of Baekje architecture is its use of curvilinear designs. Though no Baekje buildings are extant - in fact, no wooden structure of any of the Three Kingdoms now remains - it is possible to deduce from Horyuji temple in Japan, which Baekje architects and technicians helped to build, that Baekje's architecture came into full bloom after the introduction of Buddhism in 384. What remains in the building sites, patterned tiles and other relics, as well as the stone pagodas that have survived the ravages of time, testifies to the highly developed culture of Baekje.

The site of Mireuksa temple, the largest in Baekje, was excavated in 1980 at Iksan of Jeollabuk-do Province. The excavation disclosed many hitherto unknown facts about Baekje architecture. A stone pagoda at Mireuksa temple is one of two extant Baekje pagodas. It is also the largest as well as being the oldest of all Korean pagodas. Mireuksa temple had an unusual arrangement of three pagodas erected in a straight line going from east to west, each with a hall to its north. Each pagoda and hall appear to have been surrounded by covered corridors, giving the appearance of three separate temples of a style called "one Hall-one Pagoda." The pagoda at the center was found to have been made of wood, while the other two were made of stone. The sites of a large main hall and a middle gate were unearthed to the north and south of the wooden pagoda.

When the site of Jeongnimsa temple was excavated in 1982, which had also been the site of the other existing Baekje pagoda, the remains of a main hall and a lecture hall arranged on the main axis one behind the other were unearthed to the north of the pagoda. The remains of a middle gate, a main gate and a pond arranged on the main axis one in front of the other were also discovered to its south. It was found that the temple was surrounded by corridors from the middle gate to the lecture hall. This "one Pagoda" style was typical of Baekje, as the excavations of the temple site in Gunsu-ri and in Gumgangsa temple in Buyeo in 1964. The building sites of Gumgangsa temple, however, were arranged on the main axis going from east to west rather than from north to south.

[[Silla]] was the last of the three kingdoms to develop into a full-fledged kingdom. Buddhist temples were built in Silla. One of the well known examples of Silla architecture is [[Cheomseongdae]], said to be the first stone observatory in Asia. It was built during the reign of [[Queen Seondeok of Silla|Queen Seondeok]] (632-646). The structure is known for its unique and elegant form.

Silla came under Buddhist influence after 527. Since its temple was separated from China by Goguryeo or Baekje, China's cultural influence was much diluted. 

One of the earliest Silla temples, Hwangnyongsa temple was systematically excavated and studied in 1976, and found to have been of considerable magnitude. It stood in a square walled area, the longest side of which was 288 meters. The area enclosed by corridors alone was about 19,040 square meters. The [[Samguk Sagi]] (Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms) records that there was a nine-story wooden pagoda built here in 645 that was about 80 meters high by today's scale. A large image of Sakyamuni Buddha is also recorded to have been enshrined in the main hall with the stone pedestal still remaining. Constructed in the middle of the 6th century, Hwangnyongsa temple flourished for more than 680 years during which time the halls were rearranged many times. In its prime, immediately before Silla's unification of the peninsula in 668, it was arranged in the "three Halls-one Pagoda" style, quite unlike the "one Hall-one Pagoda" style of Baekje's Mireuksa temple.

Another major Silla temple was Bunhwangsa, on the site of which still stands three stories of what is recorded to have been a nine-story pagoda. As the remains show, the pagoda was made of stones cut to look like bricks. A set of stone flagpole pillars in addition to other stone relics also remain.

====Royal architecture====
Many palaces are recorded as having been built in Baekje. Some traces of them can be found at both Busosanseong, the third palace of this kingdom, and at the site of Gungnamji pond, which is mentioned in the Samguk sagi (History of the Three Kingdoms). Gungnamji means "pond in the south of the palace."

====Tomb architecture====
[[File:Tomb of the General 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tomb of the General]], presumed to be the tomb of a great Goguryeo king or military official.  Located in Ji'an, China.]]
Three Kingdoms Period mortuary architecture was monumental in scale. For example, in Goguryeo two different types of mortuary architecture evolved during this period: one type of burial is a stepped pyramid made of stone, while another is a large earth mound form. The [[Cheonmachong]] mounded burial is an example of the monumental style of mortuary architecture in the ancient Silla capital at [[Gyeongju]].

Murals in tombs dating from Goguryeo also reveal a great deal about the architecture of that period as many of them depict buildings which have pillars with entasis. Many have capitals on top of them. The murals reveal that the wooden bracket structures and coloring on the timbers, all characteristic of later Korean structures, were already in use at that time.

Korea also has a rich architectural heritage of tombs and town-wall construction. The brick tomb of [[Muryeong of Baekje|King Muryong]] (501–523 AD) is remarkable for its vaulted ceiling and arch construction.

===Unified Silla Dynasty (668-935) architecture===

====Religious architecture====
[[File:Korea-Gyeongju-Bulguksa-32.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bulguksa|Bulguk Temple]], a UNESCO World Heritage Site.]]
The plans of Buddhist temples were characterized by two pagodas in front of the central main hall in a symmetrical layout on the north-south axis with other buildings. [[Bulguksa|Bulguksa Temple]], built on a stone platform at the foothill of Mt. Toham near Gyeongju, is the oldest existing temple in Korea. The temple was first founded early in the 6th century and was entirely rebuilt and enlarged in 752. The original platform and foundations have remained intact to the present, but the existing wooden buildings were reconstructed during the Joseon dynasty.

The stone work of the two-story platform exhibits a superb sense of architectural organization and advanced building methods. Two stone pagodas stand in front of the main hall of the temple. The simpler [[Seokgatap]] located to the left of the court represents Buddha's manifestation in a transcendent calm. It has three stories with two pedestal layers and a total height reaching about twenty-five feet. The pagoda consists of simple undecorated pedestal slabs and three-story stupa each of which has five stepped eaves and truncated roofs. These characteristics constitute a typical form of the Korean stone pagodas.
[[File:Korea-Gyeongju-Bulguksa-24.jpg|right|thumb|160px|[[Dabotap|Dabo Pagoda]], a national treasure of South Korea.]]
To the right of the court, the complex [[Dabotap]] represents Buddha's manifestation in a diversified universe, and is unique in Korea, further so in Asia. With a height of thirty-five feet, this pagoda has one pedestal with a staircase on each side, four main stories with balustrade and is characterized by the final crown-ball-and-plate sequence. The design motif of the [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus flower]] is apparent in mouldings and other details of the pagoda.

The rock cave shrine of [[Seokguram]] is located on the crest of Mt. Toham. It was built by the same master architect of Bulguksa Temple, and built around the same era. This cave shrine was artificially and skillfully constructed with granite blocks and covered with an earth mound on top to give the appearance of a natural landscape. The shrine boasts a rectangular anteroom lined with large stone slabs carved with the figures of the protectors of Buddhism on each side of the walls and at the entrance passageway to the main chamber. The circular main chamber covered by an elegant dome ceiling and surrounded by carved stone wall panels depicting Boddhisattvas and the ten disciples. The graceful statue of Buddha on a lotus pedestal in the center is the dominant feature of the chamber.

Rock cave shrines are not rare in Asia, but few of these shrines and sculptures reveal such high level of artistry. None are as religiously and artistically complete in overall design as those at Seokguram

====Royal architecture====
[[File:Gyeongju anapji pond 2006-03-24.JPG|thumb|right|[[Anapji]] pond in [[Gyeongju]]]]
United Silla architecture is defined as from the 7th century to the 10th century. After the unification of the Korean peninsula into the kingdom of United Silla, Korean institutions were radically transformed. United Silla absorbed the fully matured culture of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] dynasty in China, and at the same time developed a unique [[cultural identity]]. New Buddhist sects were introduced from the T'ang and [[Buddhist art]] flourished. It was a period of peace and cultural advancement in all fields of the arts.

Architecture flourished in the royal capital of Gyeongju, though almost all traces of the former glory have vanished at the present time. The city had nearly 200,000 inhabitants at its peak, and was strategically located at the junction of two rivers and three mountains that encircle a fertile basin of about 170&amp;nbsp;km² in area. The urban area of the city was developed and expanded in three stages. In the second stage, when [[Hwangnyongsa]] Temple was located in the center, the region was developed into a grid network of road patterns with wide streets.

One of the Palace sites is marked by the [[Water reservoir|artificial lake]] of [[Anapji]] with stone works of [[retaining wall]]s delineating the former building location. The residential district of the nobles in the city was composed of great houses which were constructed conforming to the [[building code]] that granted privileges to the nobles, but forbidden to the commoners. Tiles from many ruins of the buildings were found everywhere. Of those that are still intact, show elegant and graceful design.

===Goryeo (Koryŏ) Dynasty (918-1392) architecture===
[[File:Goryeo Seopum.jpg|190px|thumb|right|A Goryeo painting depicting a royal palace.]]
Goryeo (Koryo) architecture is defined as the period between the 10th century and the 14th century. Much of the architecture in this period was related to religion and influenced by political power/ kingdom. Many buildings such as magnificent [[Buddhist temple]]s and [[pagodas]] were developed based on religious needs, as [[Buddhism]] played an important role in the culture and society at the time. It is unfortunate that little has survived to the present day, since most of the architecture from this period was built of wood. Also, the capital of the [[Goryeo]] dynasty was based in Gaesong, a city in modern-day North Korea. Its location has made it difficult for many historians in South Korea to study and analyze the architecture of this era.

Few remaining wooden structures from the late Goryeo period in [[South Korea]] show us significantly simpler bracketing than those from the 'Choson' period architecture. Bright and soft coloring of these structures had been further developed since the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreanculture.org/06about_korea/symbols/14dancheong.htm Dancheong&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622234947/http://www.koreanculture.org/06about_korea/symbols/14dancheong.htm |date=2008-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) architecture===
*{{commonscat inline|Architecture of the Joseon Dynasty}}
*''See also: [[Joseon Dynasty#Architecture|Joseon Dynasty architecture]]; and [[Five Grand Palaces]].''
[[File:Donggwol-do.jpg|right|thumb|500px|''[[Donggwoldo]]'', a landscape of the once extensive grounds of [[Changdeokgung|Changdeokgung Palace]], a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and [[Changgyeonggung|Changgyeonggung Palace]].  Painted c. 1830.]]

Joseon architecture is defined as from the 14th century to the beginning of 20th century. The founding of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] in 1392 brought to power like-minded men steeped in the doctrines of [[Neo-Confucianism]], which had slowly percolated into Korea from China in the 14th century. This ushered in a new environment that was relatively hostile to Buddhism, causing the state to gradually shift its patronage from Buddhist temples to Confucian institutions. Throughout the early dynasty, the impetus to reform society along Neo-Confucian lines led to the construction of [[hyanggyo]] (local schools) in Seoul and numerous provincial cities. Here, sons of the aristocracy prepared for civil service careers in an atmosphere of Confucian learning. Although these institutions endured through the end of the dynasty, they began to fall out of favor in the mid-16th century for a variety of reasons. Among these, the rise in population made it the prospects of a civil service career less likely than in earlier years. Also, as the [[yangban]] aristocracy matured in its understanding of Neo-Confucianism, they grew more selective in the quality and type of instruction they favored for their sons. As a result, private Confucian academies ([[seowon]]) gradually supplanted hyanggyos and became a staple of rural aristocratic life until the end of the dynasty.

Neo-Confucianism inspired new architectural paradigms. Jaesil, or clan memorial halls, became common in many villages where [[Extended family|extended families]] erected facilities for common veneration of a distant ancestor. Jongmyo, or memorial shrines, were established by the government to commemorate exceptional acts of filial piety or devotion. Even beyond these archetypes, the [[aesthetics]] of Neo-Confucianism, which favored practicality, frugality, and harmony with nature, forged a consistent architectural style throughout Korean society.

The most famous town walls are those of Seoul and Suwon. The capital's stone wall, constructed in 1396 and rebuilt in 1422, was sixteen kilometers long (only traces remain today) and had eight gates (including Namdaemun, the South Gate); Suwon's town wall, completed in 1796, was a model of construction methods in Asia at that time, as it benefited from Western influence and techniques.

===Colonial period architecture===

{{refimprove section|date=April 2012}}
{{Clear}}
During the Japanese occupation in the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Colonial Korea]] era from 1910 to 1945, there was an attempt by the colonial government of the [[Empire of Japan]] to replace Korean architecture with [[Japanese architecture|Japanese architectural traditions]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bartholomew, 'Choson Dynasty Royal Compounds: Windows to a Lost Culture', in Transactions: Royal Asiatic Society, Korea Branch Vol. 68 (Seoul: RAS, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Significant structures of Korean Imperial palace compounds and their traditional [[Korean gardens]] were demolished.  Important landscape elements were removed and sold or taken for use in Japan. Ancient [[bunjae]] trees were taken for replanting as [[bonsai]] in Japanese gardens. Also during Japanese occupation, the construction of traditional Korean religious buildings (Buddhist or Confucian) was discouraged, as well as adaptations in Christian churches. Some Korean people resisted the Japanese nationalist agenda by building traditional Korean [[hanok]] homes, such as the houses of [[Jeonju]] village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2881118 Hanok hotels become a hip choice]&lt;/ref&gt; The colonial disregard for Korean architecture and its history left important Korean landmarks neglected and unmaintained, and the deterioration or demolition of significant examples of architecture resulted.  Some historic buildings were also redecorated using Japanese ornamentation methods.

Japanese architecture was first introduced to Colonial Korea via transportation infrastructure-building programs. New [[railway]] lines had Japanese-type [[railway station]]s and [[hotel]]s. The Japanese also built new [[city hall]]s, post offices, [[barracks]] and [[military base]]s, jails and [[prison]]s, and [[police station]]s and [[Koban (police box)|police boxes (''koban'')]]. Having prohibited the use of the [[Korean language]] in the media and education, Japan built new schools for the Japanese education of Koreans.

Western 'Euro-American' Revival architectural styles were used for some new buildings important to the Japanese occupation in Korea. An example is the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical style]] [[Japanese General Government Building, Seoul|Japanese General Government Building]] (1926), the [[Seoul Station#Old Seoul Station|Seoul Station]] (1925), and the [[Seoul City Hall]] (1926).

Materials for building construction in Korea were in short supply. The Korean [[Old growth forest|old-growth]] forests and particularly large [[Cupressaceae|cypress]] logs were under Japanese [[logging]] operations and shipped to Japan, along with other exportable [[building material]]s.

The Japanese occupation blocked 20th century Western design movements, including [[Art Deco]] and [[Modernist architecture]], from reaching Colonial Korea. Korean architecture with 20th-century influences did not develop until after Korean independence in 1946.

==Modern architecture==

===Post-war period and Korean War architecture===
After the [[Surrender of Japan]] in 1945, American architecture assumed supremacy. Under [[Douglas MacArthur]], who set Korean domestic and political policy from the [[Supreme Command of the Allied Powers]] headquarters in [[Tokyo]]. Korean architecture by Koreans began once again in domestic areas, with extensive repair of the missionary churches being given priority funding. Essential repair to infrastructure followed, more patch-work than new projects, and block-built hospitals, schools, industries began simple construction under military supervision.

Seoul had survived much of [[World War II]] but during the [[Korean War]] (1950&amp;ndash;1953), many buildings were destroyed, with the city changing command between [[North Korea]]n and [[South Korea]]n powers five times. [[Urban warfare|Street-to-street fighting]] and [[artillery]] barrages levelled much of the city, as well as the bridges over the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]].  Important architectural sites were overrun and burnt by invading armies, [[looting]] was extensive, and the urban landscape suffered with little money for repairs.

With the armistice, and distinct architectural styles determined by foreign governments began a long period of development.

In the north, [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist]] and absolutist, often [[brutalist architecture]], was championed. North Korean architects studied in [[Moscow]] or [[Satellite state|Soviet satellites]], and brought back socialist worker styles and huge celebratory people's architecture on a grand and massively impressive scale.  [[Nomenklatura|Nomenclatura]] lived in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-style apartment blocks, farmers and rural workers lived in traditional houses as they always had; urbanization did not occur.  Grand buildings and huge public squares were developed in [[Pyongyang]] as architectural showpieces.  Formal processional landscapes accompanied these sites.  Nearly all architecture was government sponsored, and maintained great homogeneity of function and style.

In the south, American models defined all new Korean buildings of any importance, with domestic architecture both civil and rural keeping to traditional buildings, building techniques, and using local materials, and local vernacular styles.  The pragmatic need to rebuild a country devastated by genocide, then a civil war, led to ad hoc buildings with no particular styles, extended repeatedly, and a factory system of simple cheap expendable buildings.  As few Korean cities had a grid-system, and were often given limits by mountains, few if any urban landscapes had a sense of distinction; by the mid-1950s, rural areas were underfunded, urban areas overfilled, and [[urban sprawl]] began with little money to build distinctive important buildings.

Buildings tended to be built quickly with little regard for local identity.  As the need for housing for workers increased, traditional [[hanok]] villages were razed, hundreds of simple cheap apartments were put up very fast, and [[Bedroom community|bedroom communities]] on the periphery of the urban centres grew, built and financed as company housing.

===Sports architecture===

South Korea was selected to host the [[1986 Asian Games]] and the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympic games]], which spurred waves of new building activity. To market the country globally, international architects were encouraged to submit designs, introducing alternative concepts for modern architecture that began to put style and form ahead of spartan practicality. Historically, sports architecture has occupied the most money and the greatest expression of form identity within Korea. Hundreds of billions of [[South Korean won|won]] have been spent on defining Korea as a sports mecca with the architecture leading the way.

Most of the largest projects in the South, as in the North, were government sponsored works: but instead worked in confined, rather than open spaces, and worked with huge amounts of enclosed space, primarily in the state subsidized hugely expensive sports architecture. Korea since the 1990s had its most notable architectural works driven by sports: the two times which the country has hosted the Asian Games (1986 and 2014),the [[1988 Summer Olympics]],the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] [[2003 Summer Universiade]] and [[2015 Summer Universiade]], The country also hosted the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], as well as great support being given by the [[chaebol]]s such as the [[Samsung]] Group which itself owned the sports teams for marketing purposes.

Important architects at this time and their works, often led by the atelier-style architectural co-operative [[Space Group of Korea]], were:

* [[Park Kil-ryong]]
* [[Jungup Kim or Kim Chung-up]] - Trained in France and designed the Olympic Memorial Gate/World Peace Gate, 1988.
* [[Jongseong Kim]] – Weight Lifting Gymnasium, Olympic Park, 1986.
* [[Kim Swoo Geun]] who trained in Tokyo - Olympic Stadium. 1984. Its total area is 133,649 square metres, with 100,000 seats. It is 245×180&amp;nbsp;m diameter and 830&amp;nbsp;m in perimeter.
* [[Kyu Sung Woo]] – Olympic Village, 1984.

===Post-modern Korean architecture===

[[File:Hdipark.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Hyundai]] I-Park Tower.]]
[[File:Jongno Tower.JPG|thumb|right|220px|[[Jongno Tower]].]]

It wasn't until the late 1980s and early 1990s that an entirely new generation of Korean architects had the freedom and the financing to build Korean architecture in a distinct Korean manner. This was a result of architects studying and training in Europe, Canada, and even in South America, and seeing the need for more of a sense of unique style, and more sophisticated materials.  There was a new determination that nationalistic architectural elements had to be revived and refined. Buildings had to mean something within their cultural context.

Post-modern Korean architecture is defined as from 1986 to 2005. Cultural and museum buildings have followed; with city halls and buildings for the civil service appearing generally in a New York/Chicago style rather than following London or Paris trends.

Individuality and experimentation became the new cause for young architects, however the country as a whole was slow to move from the old traditions into seeing good architecture aesthetics as being important to the sense of a village, town, or city. Change was forced at times against intense resistance, and new buildings evolved at great cost to the architects and builders and within a great tension.

Much of the growth of new architecture came from retail stores, clothing shops, bistros, cafes, and bars; and the underside of architectural commissions, rather than from major [[government contracts]] or the financial and corporate community. Foreign corporations setting up Korean headquarters also brought in an entirely new spirit of architecture to define their own visions.

In recent years a number of large and iconic modernist projects have been developed in Seoul such as the 2008 [[Dominique Perrault]] building at  [[Ewha Womans University]], the 2012 [[Seoul City Hall]] extension by [[iArc]] and the large [[Dongdaemun Design Plaza]] designed by [[Zaha Hadid]] and opened in 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2446">'''Kuba Divination''' is a form of [[divination]] used by the [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]] people of central Africa.

Kuba divination is practiced by specialists called ''ngwoom''. According to historian John Mack, divination is used to gain access to the knowledge which only the spirits, called ''[[ngesh]]'', possess about the source of social and physical ills which may affect a community. It serves two main purposes: detection of thieves, and determining the cause of illness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mack, John. "Animal Representations in Kuba Art: An Anthropological Interpretation of Sculpture" in ''Oxford Art Journal'', Vol. 4, No. 2, Sculpture (Nov., 1981), pp. 50-56Published by: Oxford University PressArticle Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1360140&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ngwoom==
[[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]] diviners (''ngwoom'') maintain the proper relationship between ''[[ngesh]]'' and humans. Even with the establishment of [[Christian church]] congregations in many Kuba communities during the 20th Century, ''ngwoom'' and other specialists whose expertise derives from ''ngesh'' continue to practice.&lt;ref name="Binkley 2009" /&gt;

==Itoom==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 22.812 Diviners Instrument Itoom (3).jpg|thumbnail|Kuba itoom, divining discs missing, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]
Rubbing oracles (''itoom'') were used by Kuba ''ngwoom'' during the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth centuries. This practice was adopted from the related [[Kete language|Kete]] and employed extensively by the Kuba.

''Itoom'' all functioned in the same manner: a small wooden disc with a smooth base and a projecting knob was rubbed across the surface of the ''itoom'' by the ''ngwoom'' while he or she uttered a series of names or formulas. When the moving disk abruptly stopped, the desired information was disclosed.

Most ''itoom'' were created in the form of a naturalistic or abstract representation of an animal. The most common animals represented, such as the crocodile, warthog, lizard, and dog, were associated with the forest and surrounding natural habitat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Binkley 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Binkley|first=David A|title=Kuba|year=2009|publisher=5 Continents Edition|location=Milan|author2=Patricia Darish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Life Goes On''''' is a 2009 film by Sangeeta Datta. It shows how a Hindu family in Britain copes with the death of the wife and mother. The story recalls Shakespeare’s ''[[King Lear]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Life Goes On – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/mar/13/life-goes-on-review|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 March 2011|author=[[Philip French]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film is set in modern London. The central character is Sanjay, a Hindu doctor, respected in his community. After the sudden death of his wife Manju, he struggles to relate to his three daughters. The drama follows the week from Manju's death to her funeral.

As well as dealing with grief and family ties, the film addresses inter-faith issues as Sanjay discovers that the youngest daughter Dia has a Muslim boyfriend, Imtiaz.

Wandering the streets of London the night before the funeral, Sanjay recalls his own childhood, when he left home with his parents during the [[partition of India]].

This is a current listing of the media in [[Kouhei Kadono]]'s [[Boogiepop series|''Boogiepop'' series]].  This [[metaseries]] currently consists of 15 [[light novels]], a four volume light novel spin-off series, a [[live-action]] [[movie]], an [[anime]] television series, two [[manga]] serials, two [[audio CDs]], and other books.

Rumours circulate about Boogiepop being involved, but does this urban legend even exist, and does anybody really know what is going on?

The '''Miami Design District''', historically a part of [[Buena Vista (Miami)|Buena Vista]], is a neighborhood within the city of [[Miami]], [[Florida]], [[United States]], south of [[Lemon City, Florida|Lemon City]] (Little Haiti).  It is roughly bound by [[U.S. Route 27 in Florida|North 36 St (US 27)]] to the south, North 43rd Street to the north, West First Avenue to the west and [[Biscayne Boulevard]] to the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.miamidesigndistrict.net/pdf/MDDLocatorMap.pdf|title=District Design Map|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Design District was made up primarily of old [[low-rise]] [[warehouse]]s that have been converted into retail spaces, art galleries, restaurants and cafés, but now includes a large amount of new construction, primarily for high-end retail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/biz-monday/article1955427.html|title=Miami Design District’s transformation into a luxury shopping destination is underway|last=Cordle|first=Ina Paiva|date=2013-09-23|website=Miami Herald|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Design District is in the crossroads of many prominent Miami neighborhoods, with the artsy [[Wynwood]] neighborhood to the south, Lemon City ([[Little Haiti]]) and the historic 1920s [[Buena Vista (Miami)|Buena Vista]] neighborhood to the north, and the wealthy [[Upper East Side (Miami)|Upper East Side]] neighborhoods to the east. After decades of falling to [[urban decay]], the Design District has risen to fame as a destination for the arts, [[design]], and [[fashion]].

It is home to over 130 art galleries, showrooms, creative services, [[architecture firm]]s, luxury fashion stores, antiques dealers, eateries and bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.miamidesigndistrict.net/browse.php|title=Directory of Fashion, Furniture &amp; Watch Stores {{!}} Miami Design District|website=www.miamidesigndistrict.net|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-end brands like [[Louis Vuitton]], [[Christian Dior SE|Dior]], [[Prada]], [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Saint Laurent]] and [[Hermès|Hermes]] are located in the Design District as well as restaurants from award-winning chefs like Michael Schwartz and celebrities like [[Gloria Estefan|Gloria]] and [[Emilio Estefan]]; a public art collection with works from Buckminster Fuller, Marc Newsom and Urs Fischer as well as museums and galleries like the Institute for Contemporary Art, Miami, The [[De la Cruz Collection|de la Cruz Collection of Contemporary Art]] and Locust Projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/what-to-do-in-the-miami-design-district|title=What to Do in the Miami Design District: Our Guide|last=Wood|first=Sara Liss,Jennifer M.|work=Condé Nast Traveler|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The area of land that is now the Design District was once a pineapple farm in a neighborhood referred to as Buena Vista. Farm owner, T.V. Moore, built the historic Moore Building in the 1920’s for his family furniture business. The Moore Furniture Building was one of the first stores in the U.S. dedicated strictly to furniture.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicpreservationmiami.com/pdfs/2011%20designation%20reports%20updates/Buena_Vista_Post_Office_Designation_Report.pdf |title=Buena Vista Post Office Designation Report|last=|first=|date=|website=Historic Preservation Miami|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today the area today known as the Design District. Signs and names with the name Buena Vista can still be seen throughout the area such as the Buena Vista Post Office, and Buena Vista School.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

By the 1980s and early-1990s, the Design District had fallen to [[urban decay]], and it wasn't until the late 1990s, and early 2000s, that art and design stores began opening up in the Design District. Throughout the 2000s, the Design District continued to grow in popularity, and with heavy public and private investment in the neighborhood, the streets and sidewalks were redone, and new trees were planted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.departures.com/fashion/shopping/bal-harbour-shops-vs-design-district|title=Bal Harbour Shops vs. the Design District|last=Gross|first=Michael|date=2014-09-24|website=Departures|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Credited to starting the district is [[Craig Robins]], who purchased many run-down buildings in the 18 square block area and persuaded many top designers, such as Alison Spear, [[Holly Hunt]] and Peter Page to relocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://oceandrive.com/style/articles/craig-robins-jump-starts-the-design-district|title=Craig Robins Jump-Starts the Design District|last=McGee|first=Suzanne|date=2012-12-03|work=Ocean Drive|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2016, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] issued a travel warning, advising pregnant women not to visit the Design District, [[Wynwood]], and [[Midtown Miami]] areas to avoid getting the [[Zika virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Daniel Chang|author2=Emily Cochrane|title=With 10 new Zika cases in Miami, CDC advises pregnant women to avoid Wynwood|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article93057392.html|website=miamiherald.com|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]|accessdate=2 August 2016|date=1 August 2016|quote=The advisory extends to all expectant mothers, and women planning on becoming pregnant who have traveled to a one-square-mile area north of downtown Miami — including Wynwood, Midtown and the Design District — on or after June 15, said CDC Director Tom Frieden.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='cdc_zika'&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/zika/intheus/florida-update.html |title=Advice for people living in or traveling to Wynwood, a neighborhood in Miami, FL |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |access-date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Rick Scott lifted the area’s “Zika Zone” designation on September 19, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://therealdeal.com/miami/2017/06/28/wynwood-businesses-lost-as-much-as-40-in-revenue-due-to-zika-report/|title=Wynwood businesses lost as much as 40% of their revenue due to Zika: report|date=2017-06-28|work=The Real Deal Miami|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Holland Island''' ({{lang-ru|Но́вая Голла́ндия}}) is a historic triangular artificial island in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], dating from the 18th century.

==History==
The island was created in 1719, when the newly built [[Kryukov Canal]] and [[Admiralty Canal]] connected the [[Moika River]] with the [[Neva]]. The triangular island took its name after a number of canals and shipbuilding facilities that rendered its appearance similar to [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.saint-petersburg.com/buildings/new-holland/ | title=New Holland | website=Saint-Petersburg.com | accessdate=27 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter the Great]] took the opportunity to create a naval port, including a wooden palace for his own use.

During the following centuries, the island belonged to the [[Russian Admiralty]], which would adapt the plot for its various needs. Originally, there was a minor [[shipyard]] for [[rowing boat]]s. In 1732, the Admiralty engaged architect [[Ivan Korobov]] to construct a network of basins and wooden warehouses along the island's perimeter in order to store lumber for shipbuilding.

In 1765, [[Savva Chevakinsky]] was ordered to rebuild the warehouses in brick but without customary [[stucco]] decoration. By 1788, when the project was halted, [[Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe]] had designed and supervised the construction of a highly pitched [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] [[arch]] over the canal. This magnificent red-brick gateway to the island, known as the New Holland Arch, is flanked by massive [[Tuscan column]]s of red granite.

New Holland did not achieve its present appearance until the building of a naval [[prison]] in 1828–29 and a [[Basin (maritime)|basin]] for naval architects in 1893. [[Aleksei Krylov]] used this basin for testing new models of ships between 1900 and 1908. The most powerful [[radio station]] in [[Imperial Russia]] was launched there by the General Staff of the Navy in 1915. 

After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], the 18th-century buildings of New Holland Island fell into neglect, serving time as military barracks, warehouses and (most recently) offices for various commercial enterprises.

==Recent developments==
[[File:Санкт-Петербург. "Новая Голландия". Морская тюрьма. 2011г..jpg|thumb|275px|The former naval prison]]
On [[Navy Day#Russia|Navy Day]] in 2000, New Holland was opened to the public for the emplacements project (1997–2000), an art project created by artists [[Françoise Dupré]] and [[Roxane Permar]] with support from Russian artists, including [[Lyudmila Belova]] and [[Tatyana Nikolaenko]], involving over two dozen artists altogether.

In 2004, the Ministry of Defense evacuated the buildings, which were to be refurbished for hotels and clubs to a design by [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fosterandpartners.com/projects/new-holland-island/ | title=Projects / New Holland Island – St Petersburg, Russia – 2006 | publisher=[[Foster + Partners]] | date=2006 | accessdate=27 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until the consortium running the project ran into difficulties.

In 2010, a new project was established, under the control of [[Roman Abramovich]], with space for galleries and a museum, possibly to house Abramovich's art collection, acquired with the help of [[Daria Zhukova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/8164981/Roman-Abramovich-to-spend-250-million-on-St-Petersburg-art-museum-project.html | title=Roman Abramovich to spend £250 million on St Petersburg art museum project | newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] | first1=Robert | last1=Mendick | first2=Nigel | last2=Rosser | date=28 November 2010 | accessdate=27 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The island opened to the public in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.rt.com/art-and-culture/new-island-opens-public/ | title=New Holland Island in St. Petersburg opens to public | publisher=[[Russia Today]] | date=20 July 2011 | accessdate=27 December 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105031909/https://www.rt.com/art-and-culture/new-island-opens-public/ | archivedate=5 January 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Work Architecture Company]] (WORKac) of [[New York City|New York]] is working on the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.archdaily.com/156067/workac-to-redesign-st-petersburgs-new-holland-island | title=WORKac to Redesign St. Petersburg's New Holland Island | date=3 August 2011 | first=Kelly | last=Minner| publisher=ArchDaily.com | accessdate=27 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The planned £256m complex is intended to combine commercial and residential properties with the restoration of monuments that are protected by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/rbth/features/8241788/Roman-Abramovichs-romantic-island-dream.html | title=Roman Abramovich's romantic island dream | newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] | first=Susanna | last=Alperina | date=5 January 2011 | accessdate=27 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A branch of the [[Centre of Contemporary Art]] (based in Moscow) is also planned.

In [[mathematics]], a '''non-Euclidean crystallographic group''', '''NEC group''' or '''N.E.C. group''' is a [[discrete group]] of [[isometries]] of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] plane. These [[symmetry group]]s correspond to the [[wallpaper group]]s in [[euclidean geometry]]. A NEC group which contains only [[Orientability|orientation-preserving]] elements is called a [[Fuchsian group]], and any non-Fuchsian NEC group has an index 2 Fuchsian subgroup of orientation-preserving elements.

The hyperbolic [[triangle group]]s are notable NEC groups. Others are listed in [[Orbifold_notation#Hyperbolic_plane|Orbifold notation]].

A '''poster''' is any piece of printed paper designed to be attached to a wall or vertical surface.&lt;ref&gt;[Gosling, Peter. (1999). Scientist's Guide to Poster Presentations. New York: Kluwer. {{ISBN|978-0-306-46076-0}}.]&lt;/ref&gt; Typically posters include both [[typography|textual]] and [[graphic]] elements, although a poster may be either wholly graphical or wholly text. Posters are designed to be both eye-catching and informative. Posters may be used for many purposes.  They are a frequent tool of advertisers (particularly of events, musicians, and films), [[propaganda|propagandists]], [[protest]]ors, and other groups trying to communicate a message. Posters are also used for reproductions of artwork, particularly famous works, and are generally low-cost compared to the original artwork. The modern poster, as we know it, however, dates back to the 1840s and 1850s when the [[printing]] industry perfected colour [[lithography]] and made [[mass production]] possible.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Eskilson, Graphic Design: A New History, Yale University Press, 2012, pp. 43-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction===
According to the French historian [[Max Gallo]], "for over two hundred years, posters have been displayed in public places all over the world. Visually striking, they have been designed to attract the attention of passers-by, making us aware of a political viewpoint, enticing us to attend specific events, or encouraging us to purchase a particular product or service."&lt;ref name=Gallo&gt;Gallo, Max, ''The Poster in History'', (2002) W.W. Norton&lt;/ref&gt; The modern poster, as we know it, however, dates back to the mid-nineteenth century,  when several separate but related changes took place. First, the [[printing]] industry perfected colour [[lithography]] and made [[mass production]] of large and inexpensive images possible. Second, government censorship of public spaces in countries like France was lifted. And finally, advertisers began to market mass-produced consumer goods to a growing populace in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Guffey, Posters: A Global History, Reaktion: 2015, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

"In little more than a hundred years", writes poster expert John Barnicoat, "it has come to be recognized as a vital art form, attracting artists at every level, from painters like [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Mucha]] to theatrical and commercial designers."&lt;ref name=Barnicoat&gt;Barnicoat, John, ''Posters: A Concise History'', (1985) Thames and Hudson&lt;/ref&gt;  They have ranged in styles from [[Art Nouveau]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Cubism]], and [[Art Deco]] to the more formal [[Bauhaus]] and the often incoherent [[hippie]] posters of the 1960s.

===Mass production===
Posters, in the form of placards and posted bills, have been used since earliest times, primarily for advertising and announcements. Purely textual posters have a long history: they advertised the plays of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and made citizens aware of government proclamations for centuries.  However, the great revolution in posters was the development of printing techniques that allowed for cheap mass production and printing, including notably the technique [[lithography]] which was invented in 1796 by the German [[Alois Senefelder]]. The invention of lithography was soon followed by [[chromolithography]], which allowed for mass editions of posters illustrated in vibrant colours to be printed.

===Developing art form===
By the 1890s, the technique had spread throughout Europe.  A number of noted French artists created poster art in this period, foremost amongst them [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Jules Chéret]], [[Eugène Grasset]], [[Adolphe Willette]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Louis Anguetin]], [[Alfred Choubrac]], [[Georges de Feure]] and [[Henri-Gabriel Ibels]].&lt;ref&gt;The modern poster by Arsène Alexandre&lt;/ref&gt; Chéret is considered to be the "father" of advertisement placards. He was a pencil artist and a scene decorator, who founded a small lithography office in Paris in 1866. He used striking characters, contrast and bright colours, and created over 1000 advertisements, primarily for exhibitions, theatres, and products. The industry soon attracted the service of many aspiring painters who needed a source of revenue to support themselves.

[[Chéret]] developed a new [[lithographic]] technique that suited better the needs of advertisers: he added a lot more colour which, in conjunction with innovative [[typography]], rendered the poster much more expressive. Not surprisingly, Chéret is said to have introduced sex in advertising or, at least, to have exploited the feminine image as an advertising ploy. In contrast with those previously painted by [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], Chéret's laughing and provocative feminine figures, often called "chérettes," meant a new conception of art as being of service to advertising.

Posters soon transformed the thoroughfares of Paris, making the streets into what one contemporary called "the poor man’s picture gallery."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Marx, Masters of the Poster, 1896–1900 (New York, 1977), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Their commercial success was such that some fine artists took up poster design in earnest.  Some of these artists were, like Alphonse Mucha, in great demand and theatre stars personally selected their own favorite artist to do the poster for an upcoming performance. The popularity of poster art was such that in 1884 a major exhibition was held in Paris.

===Golden age of the poster===

By the 1890s, poster art had widespread usage in other parts of Europe, advertising everything from bicycles to bullfights. By the end of the 19th century, during an era known as the [[Belle Époque]], the standing of the poster as a serious artform was raised even further. Between 1895 and 1900, Jules Chéret created the [[Maîtres de l'Affiche]] (Masters of the Poster) series that became not only a commercial success but is now seen as an important historical publication. [[Alphonse Mucha]] and [[Eugène Grasset]] were also influential poster designers of this generation, known for their [[Art Nouveau]] style and stylized figures, particularly of women. Advertisement posters became a special type of graphic art in the modern age. [[Poster artist]]s such as [[Théophile Steinlen]], [[Albert Guillaume]], [[Leonetto Cappiello]], [[Henri Thiriet]] and others became important figures of their day, their art form transferred to magazines for advertising as well as for social and political commentary.. Indeed, as design historian Elizabeth Guffey notes, “As large, colorful posters began to command the spaces of public streets, markets, and squares, the format itself took on a civic respectability never afforded to Victorian handbills.”&lt;ref&gt;Guffey, op cit, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], posters underwent a slightly different evolution.  By the 1850s,  the advent of the traveling circus brought colorful posters to tell citizens that a carnival was coming to town. While many of these posters were beautifully printed, the earliest were mass-produced woodcuts; that technique, as well as their subject matter, crowded style, and bright colors, was often derided by contemporary critics.   As chromo-lithography began to reshape European posters, American artists began to take the medium more seriously.  Indeed, with work of designers like [[Edward Penfield]], or [[Will Bradley]] gained an audience in Europe as well as America.

==Decline and resurgence==
Challenged by newer modes of advertising, the poster as a communicative form began to decline after the First World War.  Civic groups had long assailed the poster, arguing that the form made public spaces ugly.  But the real threat to posters came from newer forms of advertising.  Mass-market magazines, radio and later television, and bill-boards all cut into advertiser’s marketing budgets. While posters continued to be made and advertised products, they were no longer considered a primary form of advertising.  More and more, posters purpose shifted toward political and decorative uses.

Indeed, by the mid 1960s, posters were reborn as part of a broader counter-cultural shift. By 1968 the poster craze was described as "half way between a passing fashion and a form of mass hysteria." &lt;ref&gt;David Kunzle, Posters of Protest: The Posters of Political Satire in the U.S., 1966–1970 (New York, 1971), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Sometimes called a “second golden age” or "postermania"&lt;ref&gt;Hilton Kramer, ‘Postermania’, New York Times Magazine (11 February 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; however, this resurgence of popularity saw posters used as decoration and self-expression as much as public protest or advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Guffey, op cit, 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial uses==

By the 1890s, poster art had widespread usage in other parts of Europe, advertising everything from bicycles to bullfights. Many posters have had great [[artistic merit]].  These include the posters advertising consumer products and entertainment, but also events like the [[World's Fair]]s and [[Colonialism|Colonial]] [[Art exhibitions|Exhibitions]].

===Political uses===
[[File:In God We Trust AFA Poster in New Philadelphia High School.jpg|thumb|right|A framed poster displaying the national motto of the United States, "[[In God We Trust]]," in a [[New Philadelphia High School]] classroom.|200px]]
Other times of great turmoil also produced great posters. The first widespread use of illustrated posters for political ends occurred during the First World War.  War bond drives and recruitment posters soon replaced commercial advertisements. German graphic designers, who had pioneered the simple Sachplakat style in the years leading up to the war, applied their talents to the war effort. Artists working for the Allied cause also made over their art in wartime, as well.

The 1960s saw the rise of [[pop art]] and protest movements throughout the West; both made great use of posters and contributed to the poster's revitalization at this time.
Perhaps the most acclaimed posters were those produced by [[France|French]] students during the so-called "''événements''" of May 1968. During the [[May 1968 in France|1968 Paris student riots]] and for years to come, [[Jim Fitzpatrick (artist)|Jim Fitzpatrick's]] stylized poster of [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] (based on the photo ''[[Guerrillero Heroico]]''), also became a common youthful symbol of rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;''Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon'', by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 19&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[September 11 attacks]], in the United States, public schools across the country posted "[[In God We Trust]]" framed posters in their "libraries, cafeterias and classrooms." The [[American Family Association]] supplied several 11-by-14-inch posters to school systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002/02/20/usat-posters.htm |title='In God We Trust' pressed for schools - USA Today |publisher=Usatoday30.usatoday.com |date=2002-02-19 |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poster printing==
Many [[printing]] techniques are used to produce posters. While most posters are mass-produced, posters may also be printed by hand or in limited editions. Most posters are printed on one side and left blank on the back, the better for affixing to a wall or other surface. Pin-up sized posters are usually printed on A3 Standard Silk paper in full colour. Upon purchase, most commercially available posters are often rolled up into a cylindrical tube to allow for damage-free transportation. Rolled-up posters can then be flattened under pressure for several hours to regain their original form.

It is possible to use [[Tiled printing|poster creation software]] to print large posters on standard home or office printers.

==Types of poster designs==
Many posters, particularly early posters, were used for advertising products. Posters continue to be used for this purpose, with posters advertising [[film]]s, [[music]] (both concerts and recorded albums), [[comic book]]s, and [[tourism|travel]] destinations being particularly notable examples.

===Propaganda and political posters===
[[File:German propaganda poster, Upper Silesia Plebiscite 1.jpg|thumb|[[German propaganda]] poster, 1921]]

During the [[World War I|First]] and [[Second World War]]s, recruiting posters became extremely common, and many of them have persisted in the national consciousness, such as the "[[Lord Kitchener Wants You]]" posters from the [[United Kingdom]], the "[[Uncle Sam]] wants you" posters from the United States, or the "[[Loose lips sink ships|Loose Lips Sink Ships]]" posters&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlcsmith.com/graphics/not_mine/tits.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022072541/http://www.mlcsmith.com/graphics/not_mine/tits.html |date=October 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that warned of foreign spies. Also in Canada, they were widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.mcgill.ca/warposters/english/introduction.htm |title='Canadian War Poster Collection' |publisher=Digital.library.mcgill.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Posters during wartime were also used for [[propaganda]] purposes, persuasion, and motivation, such as the famous [[Rosie the Riveter]] posters which exhorted women workers to work in factories during World War II. The [[Soviet Union]] also produced a plethora of [[World War II posters from Soviet Union|propaganda posters]],&lt;ref name="spam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://posters.nce.buttobi.net |title=Propaganda posters - Collection of 1400+ POSTERS from Russia, Czech republic, Poland and Cuba |publisher=Posters.nce.buttobi.net |date= |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which became iconic representations of the [[Great Patriotic War]].
During the democratic [[revolutions of 1989]] in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] the poster was very important weapon in the hand of the opposition. Brave printed and hand-made political posters appeared on the [[Berlin Wall]], on the statue of St. Wenseslas in [[Prague]] and around the unmarked grave of [[Imre Nagy]] in [[Budapest]] and the role of them was indispensable for the democratic change. An example of an influential political poster is [[Shepard Fairey]]'s [[Barack Obama "HOPE" poster]].

===Movie posters===
[[File:Poster for Ranch 10 by Harry Meredith.jpg|thumb|[[Lithograph]] poster for ''Ranch 10'', a [[Western (genre)|Western-themed]] [[Play (theater)|play]] by Harry Meredith which opened in [[New York City]] in August 1882]]
{{Main article|Film poster}}
The [[film]] industry quickly discovered that vibrantly coloured posters were an easy way to sell their pictures. Today, posters are produced for most major films, and the collecting of movie posters has become a major hobby. The record price for a poster was set on November 15, 2005 when US$690,000 was paid for a poster of [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' from the Reel Poster Gallery in London.&lt;ref name="metropolis"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4438948.stm |title=Lang film poster fetches record |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-11-15 |accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early horror and science fiction posters are known to bring tremendous prices as well, with an example from [[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]] realizing $452,000 in a 1997 [[Sotheby's]] auction,&lt;ref name=metropolis /&gt; and posters from both [[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]] and [[Bride of Frankenstein]] selling for $334,600 in various [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] Auctions.&lt;ref&gt;http://movieposters.ha.com/common/search_results.php?ic=homepage_search&amp;Nty=1&amp;N=54+790+231&lt;/ref&gt; The 1931 [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]] 6-sheet poster, of which only 1 copy is known to exist, is considered to be the most valuable film poster in the world.&lt;ref&gt;BIRD GEI Consultoria Idiomas. "http://birdgei.com/2012/02/07/film-posters/"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel posters===
Poster advertising or proposing a travel destination, or simply artistically articulating a place have been made. An example is the [[Beach Town Posters]] series, a collection of Art Deco travel posters of American beach resorts that refer to the advertising style of the 1920s and 1930s.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

====Railway posters====
In the early days of steam railways in Britain, the various rail companies advertised their routes and services on simple printed sheets. By the 1850s, with increasing competition and improvements in printing technology, pictorial designs were being incorporated in their advertising posters. The use of graphic artists began to influence the design of the pictorial poster. In 1905,  the [[London and North Western Railway]] (LNWR) commissioned [[Norman Wilkinson (artist)|Norman Wilkinson]] to produce artwork for a new landscape poster, advertising their rail/steam packet link to Ireland.  In 1908, for the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR),  [[John Hassall (illustrator)|John Hassall]] produced the famous image of the "Jolly Fisherman" with the "Skegness is so Bracing" slogan.  The development of this commercial art form throughout the first half of the 20th century reflected the changes in British society, along with the changing styles of art, architecture and fashion as well as changing patterns of holidaymaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrm.org.uk/OurCollection/Posters.aspx |title=Railway posters - Our collection - National Railway Museum |publisher=Nrm.org.uk |date=2009-10-13 |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Event posters===

[[Image:Replacing an advertising poster in London using an articulated platform 02.JPG|thumb|right|Replacing an advertising poster in London using an aerial work platform.]]
Posters advertising events have become common. Any sort of public event, from a rally to a play, may be advertised with posters; a few types of events have become notable for their poster advertisements.

====Boxing posters====
Boxing Posters were used in and around the actual venue to advertise the forthcoming fight, date, ticket prices, and usually consisted of pictures of each boxer. Boxing Posters vary in size and vibrancy, but are not usually smaller than 18x22 inches. In the early days, few boxing posters survived the actual event and have thus become a [[collectible]].

====Concert posters====
Many [[concert]]s, particularly [[rock concert]]s, have custom-designed posters that are used for advertisement of the event. These often become collectors items as well.

===Band/music posters===
Posters that showcase a person's favorite artist or music group are popular in [[teenager]]s' bedrooms, as well as in [[college]] [[dorm room]]s and [[apartment]]s. Many posters have pictures of popular [[rock band]]s and artists.

====Blacklight poster====
{{Main article|Blacklight poster}}
Blacklight posters are designed to have a special effect under a [[blacklight]] (ultraviolet light).

===Pin-up posters===
Pinup posters, "pinups," or cheesecake posters are pictures of attractive women designed to be displayed, first coming to popularity in the 1920s. The popularity of sexy [[pin-up girl]] posters has been erratic in recent decades.  Pin-ups such as [[Betty Grable]] and [[Jane Russell]] were highly popular with soldiers during [[World War II]] but much less so during the [[Vietnam War]]. The late 1970s and into the beginning of the 1980s were boom years for large posters of television actresses, especially [[Farrah Fawcett]] and  [[Cheryl Tiegs]].

===Affirmation posters===
[[File:Goals affirmation poster, Navy · DF-SD-04-09850.JPEG|thumb|An example of an [[Affirmation posters|affirmation poster]]]]
{{Main article|Affirmation posters}}
This refers to decorative posters that are meant to be motivational and inspirational. One popular series has a black background, a scene from nature, and a word such as "Leadership" or "Opportunity." Another version (usually [[picture frame|framed]] and matted) uses a two-image [[hologram]] which changes as the viewer walks past.

===Publications===

====Comic book posters====
The resurgence of [[comic book]] popularity in the 1960s led to the mass production of comic book posters in the 1970s and onward.  These posters typically feature popular characters in a variety of action poses.  The fact that comic books are a niche market means that a given poster usually has a smaller printing run than other genres of poster.  Therefore, older posters may be quite sought after by collectors.  Promotional posters are usually distributed folded, whereas retail posters intended for home decoration are rolled.

===Educational posters===

====Research posters and "poster sessions"====
{{Main article|Poster session}}
Posters are used in academia to promote and explain research work. They are typically shown during conferences, either as a complement to a talk or scientific paper, or as a publication. They are of lesser importance than actual articles, but they can be a good introduction to a new piece of research before the paper is published. They may be considered as [[grey literature]]. Poster presentations are often not [[peer-review]]ed,{{Contradict-inline|article=Poster session|reason=Text in the article on Poster Sessions says that the work usually HAS been peer-reviewed.|date=March 2018}} but can instead be submitted, meaning that as many as can fit will be accepted.

====Classroom posters====
Posters are a standard feature of [[classrooms]] worldwide. A typical school in North America will display a variety, including: advertising tie-ins (e.g. an historical movie relevant to a current topic of study); alphabet and grammar; numeracy and scientific tables; safety and other instructions (such as lab safety and proper hand washing) ; artwork and displays by the students.

'''''Saint Lawrence's Vision of the Virgin Mary''''' is a 1577 oil on canvas painting by [[El Greco]], produced early in his [[El_Greco#Move_to_Toledo|Toledo period]]. It was commissioned by [[Rodrigo de Castro]], inquisitor, [[archbishop of Seville]], [[bishop of Cuenca]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Zamora in Spain|bishop of Zamora]], making it one of the artist's few private commissions from that time. It is now in the Colegio del Cardenal in [[Monforte de Lemos]].

Its composition and style show the influence of [[Titian]] and [[Michelangelo]] which the painter had picked up during his time in Italy. It shows [[Saint Lawrence]] as a deacon in a finely [[brocade]]d [[dalmatic]], holding the grill on which he was martyred and looking upwards to a vision of the [[Madonna and Child]] on a cloud.

'''Seyyid Kasim Gubari''' of [[Diyarbakır]] was a 17th-century Ottoman artist, noted for his poetic writing and calligraphy. He is celebrated as one of the most accomplished calligraphers of his time and decorated a number of important public buildings including the Blue Mosque in Istanbul.

==Life and work==
Seyyid Kasim Gubari's date of birth is not known, but he lived in Diyarbakır in south-eastern (modern day) Turkey on the banks of the Tigris River. He was a direct descendant of the prophet, Mohammed which entitled him to use the appellation ''Seyyid''.&lt;ref&gt;Hueseyin Ayvansaray-i, H., ''The Garden of the Mosques: Hafiz Hüseyin Al-Ayvansarayî's Guide to the Muslim Monuments of Ottoman Istanbul'' Brill, 2000, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Born Cherif 'Abdallah, he was given the nickname of Gubari (or Ghobâri) because according to legend, he wrote, in ghobar writing, an entire chapter of the Q'ran, consisting of four verses and fifteen words, on a single grain of rice.&lt;ref&gt;Huart, C., ''Les Calligraphes et les Miniaturistes de l'Orient Musulman'', 1972, p. 123 [https://archive.org/details/lescalligraphes00huargoog  Digital copy (in French)]-&lt;/ref&gt;

4 December 2013 by D.B.S. Jeyaraj (originally published in the Indian newsmagazine ''Frontline'' on February 13–26, 1999 Vol 16-No 04 as part of the Symposium on Sri Lanka’s Cultural Experience)&lt;/ref&gt; The Tamil film industry in Sri Lanka is not as developed as [[Cinema of Sri Lanka|Sinhala cinema]] or its Indian counterpart, the [[Tamil cinema]] of [[Kodambakkam]], [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]]. There is a lot of competition from Tamil films from [[Tamil Nadu]], India as well as obstacles from the long run [[Sri Lankan Civil War|ethnic civil war in Sri Lanka]].

Tamils contributed significantly to [[Cinema of Sri Lanka|Sinhala cinema]] as well as Indian [[Tamil cinema]]. Only a few [[Tamil language]] films were produced in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. Earlier Tamil movies produced were all most destroyed or unrecovered due to civil war. A Sinhalese film was dubbed in Tamil in December 29, 1951.&lt;ref name=search/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://thaayagakkalaignarkal.blogspot.com/2007/08/blog-post_16.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The movie Samuthayam (Society), an adaptation of [[C.N. Annadurai]]’s ''Velaikkari'' was made in 16&amp;nbsp;mm and technicolor. It was shown in 1962 and 1963. Thottakkari (Plantation Woman), released on March 28, 1962, was the first Sri Lankan Tamil film in the standard 35&amp;nbsp;mm format. It included speeches by [[trade unionist]]s S. Thondaman and Azeez and was directed by Krishnakumar who also played the film's male lead.&lt;ref name=search/&gt;

As a rebirth of Sri Lankan Tamil cinema a comedy / thriller movie ‘'[[Komaali Kings]]’' was announced on January 23, 2016. The team says "‘Komaali Kings’ is an attempt to rekindle and re-establish nostalgic memories of the hay days of Sri Lankan Tamil Cinema".

The '''Station North Arts and Entertainment District''' (often referred to as just '''Station North''') is an area and official arts and entertainment district in the [[United States|U.S.]] city of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. The neighborhood is marked by a combination of artistically-leaning commercial ventures, such as theaters and museums, as well as formerly abandoned warehouses that have since been converted into loft-style living. It is roughly triangular, bounded on the north by 20th Street, on the east by Greenmount Avenue, and on the south and west by the tracks of [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]], though the neighborhood's boundaries include a one-block wide extension over the tracks.

==History==
Station North is composed of portions of three Baltimore neighborhoods: Charles North, Greenmount West, and Barclay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stationnorth.org/about |title=Station North: About |first=John McCartin |accessdate=July 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent decades, the area represented a relatively impoverished area between the wealthier neighborhoods of [[Mount Vernon, Baltimore|Mount Vernon]], [[Bolton Hill]], and [[Charles Village, Baltimore|Charles Village]]. However, in addition to its proximity to those neighborhoods, a number of factors made the area amenable to redevelopment and [[gentrification]]. Much of even the poorest sections of the neighborhood feature beautiful, three-story, early 20th-century [[rowhouse]]s as the main housing stock; the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] is within walking distance; and [[Pennsylvania Station (Baltimore)|Penn Station]] lies at the south edge of the neighborhood, providing walking-distance access to Amtrak, [[Baltimore Light Rail|Light Rail]] and [[MARC Train|MARC commuter rail]] service (the latter being of particular interest to those commuting to [[Washington, D.C.]]). The [[United States housing bubble|real estate bubble]] of the 2000s caused Baltimore's housing prices to skyrocket, and drove home buyers seeking out cheaper areas on the upswing to the neighborhood.

The Baltimore city government's 2002 designation of the area as an arts district has furthered the neighborhood's transformation. The earliest and most visible signs of change were the official conversion of several industrial and warehouse buildings to mixed-use housing. The [[Copycat Building]] is probably the best known, but two other buildings—the Oliver Street Studios Building (which also houses Area 405 and the Station North Tool Library) and the Cork Factory—are also occupied. These buildings have been in use recently as artist's studios and benefitted by the area winning the State of Maryland's first Arts and Entertainment District status under then-mayor [[Martin O'Malley]]. Such designation paved the way for these buildings to be rezoned for residential use, due to the collaboration between multiple building owners in The District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=4761 |title=For Industry to Easels - Arts District Designation Easing Conversion of Factories to Studios |first=Brennen Jensen |date=May 8, 2002 |publisher=Baltimore City Paper |accessdate=January 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708161929/http://www2.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=4761 |archivedate=July 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The neighborhood's commercial, residential, and artistic venues began to thrive. The commercial district on Charles Street is anchored by the [[Charles Theatre]], a popular art house multiplex that also serves as the anchor venue for the annual [[Maryland Film Festival]] each May, as well as Scapescape (a music and arts festival) each Labor Day weekend,[http://www.stationnortharts.com The Station North Arts Cafe Gallery], the Station North Arts Underground, [http://themetrogallery.net/ The Metro Gallery], Tapas Teatro, [http://www.clubcharles.us/ Club Charles], The Yellow Sign Theater, [http://www.strand-theater.org/ The Strand Theater], [http://singlecarrot.com/ Single Carrot Theater], and Sofi's Crepes; one block away is the [[Charm City Art Space]] which serves as a Music Venue, and Art Gallery.  In recent years, the North Avenue corridor has become a hub of activity with Joe Squared Restaurant, The Wind Up Space (an arts venue and bar), Liam Flynn's Ale House, and The Chicken Box, a Station North Arts District sponsored multiuse arts space opened in mid-2013. The Chicken Box is also home to the [http://www.baltimoreannextheater.org/ Baltimore Annex Theater].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/blog/real-estate/2012/12/station-north-arts-and-entertainment.html?page=all | title=Station North Arts and Entertainment, Annex Theater begin work on new space}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2005, the neighborhood was seeing a definite boom, but areas of blight persisted, particularly at the northern and eastern edges. As of 2010, the northern and eastern edges of Station North, particularly near Greenmount Avenue, are still affected by vacant housing, [[drug dealing]], and [[prostitution]]. This area stands in stark contrast to the environment only a few blocks west, where in 2007 the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060117031415/http://www.stationnorthtownhomes.com/ Station North Townhomes] were completed. The proximity of these luxury $300,000 townhouses to the remaining areas of urban decay illustrates both the potential and the challenges that the neighborhood faces.

==Maryland Arts and Entertainment District designation==
[[Image:Station North Arts District Baltimore Chas St.jpg|400px|right|thumb|Looking north on Charles Street, with the Charles Theatre on the right.]]
In Maryland, the State Department of Business and Economic Development designates certain neighborhoods “arts and entertainment districts”, which confers three specific tax breaks. Artists who live and work in the district are offered property-tax credits on qualifying renovations, can apply for an income-tax credit when they make money on their art, and are given a waiver of the admissions and amusement tax charged by the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanitebaltimore.com/sub.cfm?issueID=50&amp;sectionID=4&amp;articleID=699 |title=The SoHo Effect: In a creative-class economy, cities are increasingly banking on artists to save neighborhoods. Can Station North cash in without selling out? |first=Elizabeth Evitts Dickinson |date=July 2007 |publisher=Urbanite Magazine |accessdate=January 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118214812/http://www.urbanitebaltimore.com/sub.cfm?issueID=50&amp;sectionID=4&amp;articleID=699 |archivedate=November 18, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists who live or work in Station North may qualify for certain tax breaks by submitting Form 502AE (Subtraction For Income Derived Within An Arts and Entertainment District) with their Maryland Tax Returns. Major tax benefits concerning building usage are also in place, with assessment freezes and building rehab credits to encourage growth.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Criticism of gentrification==
It has been argued that the Arts District designation confers little benefit to the artists who worked so tirelessly to rebuild the area and change the antiquated zoning laws which were heavy industrial, to mixed use - for studios, retail and living spaces. Many of the benefits promised residents and building owners when the District was formed have never materialized and the line of direct communication with the Mayor's office, which oversaw the transformation, is just a faded memory.

Although the city and state have developed preliminary plans to provide affordable housing and work space for local artists and residents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimorehousing.org/pressroom_detail.asp?id=104 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120721072151/http://www.baltimorehousing.org/pressroom_detail.asp?id=104 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-21 |title=Preserving Affordable Housing in Greenmount West |first=John Fritze |date=unknown, 2007? |publisher=Baltimore Sun |accessdate=January 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; many argue that the area provides few actual benefits to working artists. This has fostered the sentiment that the city has been exploiting the cachet of the artists in Station North, while rarely working with them in any meaningful way.

Furthermore, as the neighborhood undergoes gentrification, there is the concern that, like [[SoHo]] in [[Manhattan]] before it, local artists and entertainers will be forced out of the neighborhood if a proper balance is not struck between redevelopment and the needs of artists and lower income residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbanitebaltimore.com/sub.cfm?issueID=50&amp;sectionID=4&amp;articleID=699 |title=The SoHo Effect: In a creative-class economy, cities are increasingly banking on artists to save neighborhoods.

==Transportation==

Station North's namesake comes from its placement of being north of [[Penn Station (Baltimore)|Penn Station]], which houses [[Amtrak]] and [[MARC (rail)|MARC]] trains. The [[Baltimore Light Rail]]  has two stations that are within proximity to the district; [[Penn Station (Baltimore)|Penn Station]] and [[North Avenue (Baltimore Light Rail station)|North Avenue]]. [[MTA Maryland]] bus lines 3, 8, 11, 13, 27, 36, 61, and 64 also service the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/ST+PAUL+ST+%26+PENN+STATION+DR+sb/@39.3117647,-76.6175071,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c80494e6848cf5:0x603d8ba26f401b10?hl=en | title=SAINT PAUL ST &amp; PENN STATION fs sb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future plans==

A 2006 Action Plan Report, prepared by Randall Gross / Development Economics, the Baltimore Neighborhood Collaborative, and Station North Arts &amp; Entertainment, Inc., focuses on four key strategies: To strengthen positive image and identity, to establish commercial corridors, to provide housing options to attract new residents while preventing displacement of existing residents, and to encourage economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abagmd.org/usr_doc/SN_Action_Plan.pdf |title=Action Plan Report: Station North Strategic Plan |date=August 2006 |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2008, Baltimore’s development arm, the Baltimore Development Corporation (BDC), released a preview of their master plan for the area. In the near term, the master plan includes converting the top three floors of Penn Station into a botique hotel, with long-term goals including construction of high-rise residential buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoregrows.com/2008/01/29/master-plan-for-charles-north |title= Master Plan for Charles North |date=January 29, 2008 |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 30, 2008, Mayor [[Sheila Dixon]] unveiled the Charles North Vision Plan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoredevelopment.com/files/pdf/rfp/upload/CharlesNorth_Brochure_lowres.pdf |title=Press Release: Vision Plan for Charles North |accessdate=January 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123032815/http://www.baltimoredevelopment.com/files/pdf/rfp/upload/CharlesNorth_Brochure_lowres.pdf |archivedate=November 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoredevelopment.com/files/pdf/rfp/upload/Charles%20North%20Vision%20Plan%20Presentation.pdf |title=Charles North Vision Plan |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; a multi-phased development initiative. This plan identified four areas to focus revitalization on: Charles Gateway/Penn Station, the corner of Charles Street and North Avenue, the creation of an "Asia Town" at 20th Street and Charles Street, and the "Creative/Design Zone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baltimorecity.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=xb8yKcmAVao%3d&amp;tabid=1177&amp;mid=2230 |title=Mayor Dixon and Central Baltimore Community Announce Charles North Vision Plan |date=October 30, 2008 |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoredevelopment.com/files/pdf/rfp/upload/0806%5b1%5d...L%20BOOK.pdf |title=Charles North: The Operations Manual |date=June 18, 2008 |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan's ultimate goal is to transform the arts and entertainment district north of Pennsylvania Station into a $1 billion "cultural crossroads" for Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2008-10-30/news/0810290151_1_charles-north-north-vision-north-avenue |title=City unveils 30-year plan to transform 100-acre north pf Penn Station into a regional crossroads of culture |first=Edward Gunts |date=October 30, 2008 |publisher=The Baltimore Sun |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan calls for over $100 million in subsidies to aid in the development of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoredevelopment.com/files/pdf/rfp/upload/Charles%20North%20Vision%20Plan%20Presentation.pdf |title=Charles North Vision Plan |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An agreement with Hospitality Partners of Bethesda to construct the hotel in Penn Station was reached in 2009, with completion of the $9 million project scheduled for late 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2009-05-29/business/0905280098_1_amtrak-train-station-penn-station |title=Inn Pulls Into Station: Amtrak Plans Hotel In Area Tagged For Revitalization |first=Edward Gunts |date=May 29, 2009 |publisher=Baltimore Sun |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2010, construction began on City Arts, a $15 million housing development for artists. Consisting of 69 apartments for rent and eight town houses for sale, City Arts will be the first all-new housing project in the {{convert|100|acre|km2|adj=on}} arts district since a $1 billion "vision plan" was unveiled for the area in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bal-bz.digest082jan08,0,2961754.story |title=InConstruction begins on City Arts housing for artists |first=Edward Gunts |date=January 8, 2010 |publisher=Baltimore Sun |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building will consist of four stories of apartments, a multipurpose first-floor space provided for artistic use by the residents, and thirty-five off-street parking spaces. Key to the project’s plans are financing regulations that will ensure the space remains affordable to artists even as the neighborhood changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://urbandiscoveriesblog.com/2009/06/25/development-spotlight-city-arts/ |title=Development Spotlight: City Arts |first=Edward Gunts |date=June 25, 2009 |publisher=Urban Discoveries Baltimore |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was featured on CNN as an example of how federal Recovery Act money has restarted development that stalled during the economic downturn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/video/?/video/business/2009/09/22/endo.neighborhood.makeover.cnn |title=Neighborhood Gets A Makeover |first=Sandra Endo |date=September 22, 2009 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stjepan Filipović''' (27 January 1916 &amp;ndash; 22 May 1942) was a [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]] communist who led ''Kolubara Company of the Valjevo Partisan Detachment'' during the 1941 [[Uprising in Serbia (1941)|Partisan uprising]]. He was captured and executed in 1942 in [[Valjevo]]. The photo of him taken shortly before the execution has become a symbol of resistance against fascism in the Second World War. He was proclaimed [[Order of the People's Hero|People's Hero of Yugoslavia]] in 1949.

==Biography==
[[File:Mladi Stjepan Filipović.jpg|left|thumb|Young Stjepan Filipović (right)]]
[[File:Stjepan Filipović.JPG|right|thumb|Monument to Filipović in Valjevo]]
Stjepan Filipović was born on 27 January 1916 in [[Opuzen]] (modern-day [[Croatia]]) as fifth child in the family of Anton and Ivka Filipović. The Filipović family moved throughout the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], so he lived in [[Županja]], [[Mostar]] and [[Kragujevac]]. In Kragujevac, he studied locksmithing and mastered the basics of electrical wiring, carpentry and bookbinding.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.starosajmiste.info/blog/stjepan-filipovic-heroj-radnicke-i-antifasisticke-borbe-70-godina-od-smrti/&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the labour movement in 1937, but he was arrested in 1939 and sentenced to a year in prison. He joined the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] in 1940.

Filipović was commander of the Partisans' Tamnavsko-Kolubarski unit in [[Valjevo]] (modern-day [[Serbia]]) by 1941. He was captured on 24 February 1942 by [[Axis powers|Axis forces]] and hanged in [[Valjevo]] on 27 May 1942, aged 26. As the rope was put around his neck, Filipović defiantly thrust his hands out and shouted "Smrt fašizmu, sloboda narodu!" which translates as "[[Death to fascism, freedom to the people]]!". He urged the Yugoslav people to resist and implored them to never cease resisting. At this moment, a photograph was taken which has since become famous, and from which a statue of Filipović was cast.&lt;ref&gt;''A Concise History of Bosnia'', Cathie Carmichael, Cambridge University Press, 2015 {{ISBN|1107016150}}, 9781107016156 page 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, Upton; Sagarin, Edward; Teichnerhe, Albert; ''Cry for Justice: An Anthology of the Literature of Social Protest'', p. 438; L. Stuart, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

Filipović was declared a National Hero of Yugoslavia on 14 December 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Richard; ''The Blue Butterfly: Selected Writings'' p. 144; Salt, 2006, {{ISBN|1-84471-258-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The town of Valjevo has a statue dedicated to him, "''Stevan'' Filipović". A monument was also erected in his home town of Opuzen in 1968, but was demolished in 1991; reconstruction is planned by the Croatian [[Ministry of Culture (Croatia)|Ministry of Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Dubrovnik/tabid/75/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/116498/Default.aspx | language = Croatian | title = Pao partizan - Antifašisti će tužiti opuzensku vlast | date = 2010-09-24 | accessdate = 2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Dubrovnik/tabid/75/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/120526/Default.aspx | language = Croatian | newspaper = [[Slobodna Dalmacija]] | title = Srušeni heroj - Stjepan Filipović vraća se u centar Opuzena | date = 2010-11-06 | accessdate = 2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war his two brothers Nikola and Šimun Filipović also died.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:kabelac8.jpg|thumb|right|Miloslav Kabeláč: Symphony no.8 "Antiphonies" (album cover)]] --&gt;
The '''8th Symphony "Antiphonies"''', Op. 54, by [[Miloslav Kabeláč]] was written in 1970 as a reflection of the composer's feelings from the invasion of [[Warsaw Pact]] troops into [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1968 and the onset of so-called "normalization" process in the society, which means renewal of strong dictate of the regime of pro-Soviet communist rulers, including heavy loss of basic freedoms for citizens of the country.

The composition consists of nine parts – five movements and four interludes, structure of which is controlled by a firm logical order, proportionally and symmetry. Its structural and expressive axis is the third – the longest movement. The intermedia linking the individual movements correspond both in time and music and differ only in an alternately opposite dynamic succession. The work is written for a [[percussion]] ensemble (6 musicians), the [[organ (music)|organ]], a coloration [[soprano]] and two mixed [[choir]]s (large and small). The text of the vocal part is taken from the [[Old testament]].

The 8th Symphony was inspired by [[France|French]] ensemble [[Les Percussions de Strasbourg]] which presented its premiere with the [[Czech people|Czech]] soloists [[Jana Jonášová]] (soprano) and [[Václav Rabas]] (organ) in [[Strasbourg]] in June 1971.

== Description of composition ==
For this work Kabeláč selected quotations and formulas of a magical and symbolic meaning: [[The writing on the wall|Mene, tekel, upharsin]] – Amen – Hosanna – Hallelujah. The musical language of the Symphony is [[modality (music)|modal]], growing from one of Kabeláč's extraordinary artificial [[pitch (music)|tone]]-creative principles. The climax of the 3rd movement even suggest a quotation of the Gregorian "[[Dies irae]]". The musical expression makes use of elements of exclamation, [[rhythm]]ic shouts, monotonous and exalted [[invocation]]s. The basic idea of the work is namely an emphatic warning against the danger of a decline of all positive values of humanity (the historical situation at the time of the origin of the work should be recalled). The suggestive pictures of destruction and suffering alternate at first with apathy. Only later does a beam of hope emerge from the destructive storm and the end of the work suggests the grasping of the hope. It is in fact a positive end, though marred by redeeming suffering.

[[Andrew Lang]] included it in ''[[The Yellow Fairy Book]]'' (1894), but provided no bibliographical information and its origin remains obscure.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lang, ''The Yellow Fairy Book'', [http://www.mythfolklore.net/andrewlang/009.htm "The Blue Mountains"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
A [[Scotsman]], an [[Englishman]] and an [[Irishman]] all ran away from the army together. After several days, the Scotsman saw a castle, went to it without speaking to the others, and met a lady. At his request, she gave him a meal and a bed to sleep. And then the same thing happened to the Englishman.

The Irishman saw the same castle and went to it, but when the lady gave him food, he stared about the castle and did not eat. When she asked, he said he could not eat without knowing who she was or where she came from, or how she came there. She told him she was an [[incantation|enchanted]] [[Princess and dragon|princess]], and if a man stayed in a little room from ten until midnight for [[rule of three (writing)|three]] nights running, she would be freed. Every night creatures came into the room and beat him, but the princess had a [[potion|bottle]] that cured him every morning.

She went off and told him she would back in a coach and six. A little lad came, and when he went to wait for the princess, the lad stuck a pin in his coat, putting him to sleep. When the princess came, the lad told her he was asleep. The princess said she would come once more, and then he would not see her again. The Irishman resolved to keep awake, but the boy stuck the pin in his coat again, and the princess left, leaving him a sword.

He woke up the other men in the castle and gave them silver and plate to carry away and set out in search of her. Three years later, he pulled out the sword in order to kill himself and found written on it, You will find me in the Blue Mountains. He set out in search of the Blue Mountains and found an old man who had not seen anyone in three hundred years. The old man, that night, looked through his book, which contained the history of the world, but found nothing of where the Blue Mountains were. He blew a [[magical item|magical whistle]], which let the Irishman travel to his brother's, nine hundred miles away, in a day. This brother summoned all the birds to consult them. Last of all, an eagle came; it had come from the Blue Mountains. The eagle said that the daughter of the king of the Blue Mountains was about to marry, because she had agreed with her father that if the man who had saved her had not arrived in that time, she would marry. 

The eagle said if they killed sixty cattle and the Irishman would throw quarter of one into its mouth every time it turned its head, it could carry him. So he and the old man hunted, and it flew off with him and the meat, but near the castle, the meat ran out, and the eagle threw him off. He landed in the bay and was able to get ashore. He gave a guinea to the king's [[:wiktionary:henwife|henwife]] to bring the princess to him. She recognized the Irishman and married him instead of her new [[False hero|bridegroom]].

'''''View and Plan of Toledo''''' is a work of [[El Greco]], made in 1608 during his last period. It is preserved in the [[El Greco Museum, Toledo]].

==Analysis==
This work moves away from the beautiful and stylized descriptions of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]; it shows a great meticulousness. This fostered the assumption that it was commissioned by the city council. The enormous detail that was made on the plane caused many scholars to guess that this is a work of [[Jorge Manuel Theotocópuli|Jorge Manuel]], son of the painter and expert in architecture.

At the top of the canvas is the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], accompanied by a court of angels carrying the chasuble of [[Ildefonsus|San Ildefonso]]. In this work it could be read as an anticipation of [[impressionism]], and even [[Paul Cézanne]].

[[William Blake]] illustrated ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' more often than any other work by [[John Milton]], and illustrated Milton's work more often than that of any other writer. The illustrations demonstrate his critical engagement with the text, specifically his efforts to redeem the "errors" he perceived in his predecessor's work.

==Description and provenance==
[[File:But536.1.4.wc.100.jpg|thumb|''Satan Watching the Endearments of Adam and Eve'' (1808), version from the "Butts set"]]

'''The Thomas set'''

The paintings of the Thomas set are each approximately 10x 8.25 inches. They were commissioned by the Reverend Joseph Thomas at an unrecorded date, sometime before 1807. Although the sheets were trimmed at some time, obliterating the date from several, some still retain the date of 1807, establishing the year of their completion. Thomas' grandson inherited them from his father, and sold them at [[Sotheby's]] in 1872. By 1876 they were in the collection of Alfred Aspland, who by 1885 took them to Sotheby's again, dispersing the set among several buyers. [[Henry E. Huntington|Henry Huntington]] reunited the works in 1914, and today they are still in the collection of the [[Huntington Library]].

'''The Butts set'''

The dimensions of the Butts set, also known as the "large set", are 19.5x15.5 inches, nearly twice that of the Thomas set. Dated 1808, they were commissioned from Blake by his patron Thomas Butts, who also commissioned many paintings on biblical themes from Blake. In the early 1850s, Butts' son Thomas Butts Jr. offered the individual paintings for sale at several auctions, resulting in the dispersal of the set. Today it remains divided between four museums. Nine of the paintings were sold at Messrs. Foster in 1853 to J. C. Strange, passing through several other hands before they were acquired by the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], their present owner. The other three were sold to one "Fuller" at an unknown date, from whom the passed to H.A.J. Munro. Munro further complicated matters by selling the three paintings to separate buyers at [[Christie's]] in 1868. No. 1 was acquired by the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in 1869, No. 2 by [[Henry E. Huntington|Henry Huntington]] in 1916, and No. 10 by the [[Houghton Library]] in 1966.

'''The Linnell set'''

The Linnell set is incomplete – it contains only ''Satan Watching the Endearments of Adam and Eve'', ''The Creation of Eve'' and ''Michael Foretells the Crucifixion''. These are exactly the same as their corresponding entries in the Butts set in both size and composition, the major difference being their loose handling of the watercolor. Like the Linnell set of [[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|William Blake's ''Illustrations of the Book of Job'']], these were commissioned by Blake's patron [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]], and traced by Linnell from the Butts set. An entry in Linnell's journal dates the commission to 9 May 1822. Currently ''Satan Watching the Endearments of Adam and Eve'' and ''The Creation of Eve'' are in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]], and ''Michael Foretells the Crucifixion'' is in the collection of the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]].

==Analysis==
[[File:THe Four Zoas.jpg|thumb|Illustration to ''[[Milton a Poem]]''. In Blake's mythology, Adam and Satan are two extremes of the fallen Albion.]]
There are twelve plates in each of the ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' sets, one for each of the books in the poem. While some of these, such as ''Satan, Sin and Death: Satan Comes to the Gates of Hell'', depict specific scenes from the epic; others, such as ''Satan Watching the Endearments of Adam and Eve'', are syntheses of several scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar 1980, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, Blake employed visual barriers to separate the elements from different scenes, such as the arc of the bower in ''Satan Watching the Endearments of Adam and Eve''.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar 1980, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[William Blake's mythology|Blake's mythology]], [[Albion (Blake)|Albion]]'s fall from a divine [[androgyny]] to a sexual nature divides him into the Four Zoas, their spectres (representative of hypocritical morality), and their emanations (female halves). In the ''Paradise Lost'' illustrations, Adam is analogous to the fallen [[Albion (Blake)|Albion]], Satan to Adam's [[Spectre (Blake)|Spectre]] and Eve to Adam's [[William Blake's mythology|emanation]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

As a basic element of human expression, [[dance]] is found within many of the world's [[religion]]s, and is frequently associated with [[worship]]. However, use of the term '''worship dance''' appears to be restricted to [[Christianity]] and [[Messianic Judaism]].

==Christianity==
[[Dance]] has had a chequered history within [[Christianity]]. Many records exist of prohibitions by leaders within most branches of the [[Christian Church]], for such reasons as the association of dance with [[paganism]], fears relating to sexuality, and a Greek-influenced belief in the separation of soul and body.

However, beginning in the latter half of the 20th century there was a significant growth in the use of dance within [[Christian worship]]. This received a boost within the framework of the [[charismatic movement]] of the 1970s, which initiated a transition to [[contemporary worship]] in many churches.

==Hinduism==
[[Image:classical indian dance 8.jpg|right|260px|thumb|Classical Indian dance]]
From a Hindu point of view, the whole Universe is being brought into existence as the manifestation of the dance of the Supreme Dancer, [[Nataraja]]. In the Hindu scriptures every god has his or her own style ([[lasya]] and [[tandava]] respectively represent two aspects of dance). We read about 23 celestial beings called [[Apsara]]s who dance to please the gods and express the supreme truths in the magic of movement.

The dance in Hinduism used to be a part of a sacred temple ritual, especially in South and Eastern India, where the female priestesses [[devadasi]]'s worshipped different aspects of the Divine through the elaborate language of mime and gestures. [[Natyashastra]] is the most ancient and the most elaborate scripture describing every element and aspect of this sacred art-worship.

The temple dance gradually evolved into what is known today as the South Indian Classical Dance that still preserves many ritualistic elements of Hinduism. Some of the [[classical Indian dance]]rs are believed to be incarnations of apsaras.

[[File:Tari Pendet.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Pendet dancers hold silver bowl of flowers.]]
'''Pendet''' is a traditional dance from [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]], in which floral offerings are made to purify the temple or theater as a prelude to ceremonies or other dances. Pendet is typically performed by young girls, carrying bowls of flower petals, handfuls of which are cast into the air at various times in the dance. Pendet can be thought of as a dance of greeting, to welcome the audience and invite spirits to enjoy a performance.&lt;ref name="BaliNOW"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nowbali.co.id/pendet-a-beautiful-welcoming-dance/|title=Pendet: A Beautiful Welcoming Dance - NOW! Bali|date=2015-12-09|work=NOW! Bali|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pendet can be divided into two types, the sacred dances called ''Wali'' and entertainment dances called ''Bebalihan''. ''Wali'' (sacred dances) are usually performed only during certain ritual ceremonies. [[Balinese Hinduism|Balinese Hindus]] believed that the sacred dances has strong religious significance and spiritual power, thus only can be performed during specific religious ceremony by specific dancers. ''Bebalihan'' are usually performed in social events. In addition to entertain, ''Bebalihan'' also has other purposes including welcoming guests, celebration of harvests, or gathering crowds. ''Bebalihan'' has more variations than ''Wali''. Pendet is considered as a form of ''Bebalihan'', often performed secularly to welcome guests or audiences. Pendet believed as a representation of Balinese floral offering ritual, which offered ''banten'' or ''canang'' (floral offerings) from shrine to shrine within [[Balinese temple]] or residential compounds. Initially, Pendet dance is used as a complement of ''piodalan'' ceremonies in temples or family shrines, as a symbol of gratitude, respect, and joy when welcoming the presence of the gods who descend from ''khayangan'' (realm of gods).

==Judaism==
A distinctive style of worship dance has developed within [[Messianic Judaism]]. Known as ''messianic dance'' or ''davidic dance'' (named after [[King David]], who famously danced before the [[Ark of the Covenant]]), it takes a similar form to [[Israeli Folk Dancing]]. And there also is a dance known as Lippo dancing that was originated in the late 1800's by a handsome , clever man known as Chevaughn Rowe III, who later became a wealthy astronomer and mathematician.

'''Yung Chang''' (born 1977) is a [[Chinese Canadian]] [[film director]] and was part of the collective member directors of Canadian film production firm [[EyeSteelFilm]].

==Biography==
Chang, made his first feature documentary, ''[[Up the Yangtze]]''  in 2007. The film used China's highly contested [[Three Gorges Dam]] as a dramatic backdrop for a moving and richly detailed narrative of a peasant family negotiating unprecedented historic changes. ''Up the Yangtze'' played at numerous festivals, including Sundance, and was one of the top-grossing documentary box office releases in 2008. ''[[China Heavyweight]]'', Chang's sophomore film, is about a boxing coach and his two students in rural China fighting to become amateur and professional champions. The film had its premiere at Sundance 2012 in the World Documentary competition. It is distributed by [[Zeitgeist Films]]. In the same year, Chang also completed ''[[The Fruit Hunters]]'', a feature documentary about nature, commerce and obsession in the fruit underworld. The film is distributed by [[Cinedigm New Video]]. Chang is writing ''Eggplant 《茄子》'', his first feature fiction film,  about a Chinese wedding photographer. The project was selected to participate in the prestigious [[Sundance Institute]] Director and Screenwriters labs in 2015. He is in pre-production for a feature documentary about [[Robert Fisk]], the controversial Middle East correspondent co-produced by the [[National Film Board of Canada]]. His latest film, Gatekeeper, is on the festival circuit and streaming on Field of Vision, [[Laura Poitras]]' curated online film unit.

Awards highlights for ''Up the Yangtze'' include: 2009 [[Independent Spirit Awards]] Nominee; 2009 [[Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards]]; Best Canadian Documentary, 2007 [[Vancouver International Film Festival]]; Best Documentary Feature, 2008 [[San Francisco International Film Festival]]; 2008 [[Toronto International Film Festival]] Group Canada's Top 10 film; finalist for the [[IDFA Joris Ivens Award]], 2007 [[International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam]]; and Grand Jury nominee for Best Documentary in the World Cinema competition at the 2008 [[Sundance Film Festival]].
