[[File:Mathis Gothart Grünewald 062.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Grünewald's painting "[[The Mocking of Christ (Grünewald)|The Mocking of Christ]]" depicts Christ being lashed and abused.]]
The '''aestheticization of violence''' in high culture [[art]] or [[mass media]] has been the subject of considerable controversy and debate for centuries. In Western art, graphic depictions of the [[Passion of Christ]] have long been portrayed, as have a wide range of depictions of warfare by later painters and graphic artists. Theater and, in modern times, cinema have often featured battles and violent crimes, while images and descriptions of violence have always been a part of literature. Margaret Bruder states that the aestheticization of violence in film is the depiction of violence in a "stylistically excessive", "significant and sustained way" in which audience members are able to connect references from the "play of images and [[semiotics|signs]]" to artworks, [[genre]] conventions, cultural [[symbol]]s, or concepts.&lt;ref name="bruder"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gradnet.de/papers/pomo2.archives/pomo98.papers/mtbruder98.htm |title= Aestheticizing Violence, or How To Do Things with Style |accessdate=2007-06-08 |last= Bruder |first= Margaret Ervin |year= 1998 |publisher= Film Studies, Indiana University, Bloomington IN |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040908094032/http://www.gradnet.de/papers/pomo2.archives/pomo98.papers/mtbruder98.htm |archivedate= 2004-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power of representation==

===In high culture===
[[High culture]] forms such as [[fine art]] and [[literature]] have aestheticized violence into a form of autonomous art. In 1991, [[University of Georgia]] literature professor [[Joel Black]] stated that "(if) any human act evokes the aesthetic experience of the sublime, certainly it is the act of murder". Black notes that "...if murder can be experienced aesthetically, the murderer can in turn be regarded as a kind of artist—a performance artist or anti-artist whose specialty is not creation but destruction" (1991: 14). This conception of an [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] element of murder has a long history; in the 19th century, [[Thomas de Quincey]] wrote that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Everything in this world has two handles. [[Murder]], for instance, may be laid hold of by its moral handle... and that, I confess, is its weak side; or it may also be treated aesthetically, as the Germans call it—that is, in relation to good taste."&lt;ref name="dequincey"&gt;{{cite book |last= de Quincey |first= Thomas |authorlink= Thomas de Quincey |title= On Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts |url= http://supervert.com/elibrary/thomas_de_quincey |format= Zipped PDF download |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |year= 1827 |isbn= 1-84749-133-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In popular culture===
In addition to high culture aestheticizations of violence, mass media forms such as [[newspaper]] and [[television]] news reporting have produced sensationalized reports on [[crime]] and warfare. [[Maria Tatar]]'s book ''Lustmord: Sexual Murder in [[Weimar Germany]]'' analyzes murders in pre-Hitler Germany and their artistic representations, investigating "the chilling motives behind representations that aestheticize violence, and that turn the mutilated female body into an object of fascination".&lt;ref name="pupress"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/quotes/q5641.html |title= Additional Reviews and/or Endorsements for Tatar, M.: Lustmord: Sexual Murder in Weimar Germany |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |date= 2007-04-30 |publisher= [[Princeton University Press]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060906023727/http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/quotes/q5641.html |archive-date= 2006-09-06 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baath Party Headquarters, Baghdad (3148598572).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The bombed-out remains of the Baath Party Headquarters in Baghdad.]]
Lilie Chouliaraki's article, "The aestheticization of suffering on television" (2006), analyzes "an example of war footage in order to trace the ways in which the tension between presenting airwar as an 'objective' piece of news and as an instance of intense human suffering is resolved in television's strategies of mediation". For example, Chouliaraki argues that the "bombardment of Baghdad in 2003 during the Iraq war was filmed in long-shot and presented in a quasiliterary [[narrative]] that capitalized on an aesthetics of horror, on sublime [[spectacle]] (Boltanski). She says that the "aestheticization of suffering on television is thus produced by a visual and linguistic complex that eliminates the human pain aspect of suffering, whilst retaining the phantasmagoric effects of a [[tableau vivant]]", producing an "aestheticization of suffering [that] manages simultaneously to preserve an aura of objectivity and impartiality, and to take a pro-war side in the war footage".&lt;ref name="chouliaraki"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Chouliaraki |first= Lilie |authorlink=  |coauthors=  |year= 2006 |title= The aestheticization of suffering on television |journal= Visual Communication |volume= 5 |issue= 3 |pages= 261–285 |doi= 10.1177/1470357206068455 |url= http://vcj.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/5/3/261.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070628021152/http://vcj.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/5/3/261.pdf |archivedate= 2007-06-28 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In films ====
A number of filmmakers from the 20th century have used aestheticized depictions of violence. According to James Fox, filmmaker [[Donald Cammell]] "...looked upon violence as an artist might look on paint. [He asked:] What are its components? What's its nature? Its glamour?"&lt;ref name="schneider"&gt;{{cite journal |quotes= |last= Schneider |first= Steven Jay |date= 2001-06-01 |title= Killing in Style: The Aestheticization of Violence in Donald Cammell's 'White of the Eye' |journal= Scope - An Online Journal of Film and Television Studies |issn= 1465-9166 |url= http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/film/journal/articles/killing-in-style.htm  |format= Archive |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040619114211/http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/film/journal/articles/killing-in-style.htm |archivedate = 2004-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Thomas Harris]] created a fictional character called [[Hannibal Lecter]], a [[cannibalism|cannibal]] and aesthete killer. In the films adapted from his work, ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991) and ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'' (2001), directors [[Jonathan Demme]] and [[Ridley Scott]], respectively intentionally generate excitement and anticipation when Lecter is about to kill (and eat) a victim. Lecter was portrayed by [[Anthony Hopkins]]. In [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986), the villain of the film, [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]], is an excessively violent man who obsesses over small [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]]es (such as blue velvet) when he is attacking and raping his victims; his obsessions help him achieve [[orgasm]].

In the film ''[[Man on Fire (2004 film)|Man on Fire]],'' which tells the story of a burnt-out former [[Black Ops]] agent who seeks to avenge the kidnappers of a young girl he was bodyguarding, a character says that the agent is an "artist" in killing.

See here: http://www.miramax.com/movie/kill-bill-volume-1/ --&gt; Volume 1]]'', entitled "Beauty and violence", he calls the film "a groundbreaking aestheticization of violence".  Morales says that the film, which he calls "easily one of the most violent movies ever made", "a breathtaking landscape in which art and violence coalesce into one unforgettable aesthetic experience".&lt;ref name="morales"/&gt;

Morales argues that "...&amp;nbsp;Tarantino manages to do precisely what Alex de Large was trying to do in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]:'' he presents violence as a form of expressive art...[in which the]...violence is so physically graceful, visually dazzling and meticulously executed that our instinctual, emotional responses undermine any rational objections we may have. Tarantino is able to transform an object of moral outrage into one of aesthetic beauty...[, in which,]...like all art forms, the violence serves a communicative purpose apart from its aesthetic value". When the female sword-wielding protagonist "...skillfully slices and dices her way through...[the opposing fighters]...we get a sense that she is using them as a kind of canvas for her expression of revenge...[,]...like an artist who expresses herself through brush and paint,...[she]...expresses herself through sword and blood".&lt;ref name="morales"&gt;{{cite news|first=Xavier |last=Morales |title=Beauty and violence |url=http://media.www.hlrecord.org/media/storage/paper609/news/2003/10/16/Etc/Kill-Bill.Beauty.And.Violence-530854.shtml |work=The Record |publisher=Harvard Law School RECORD Corporation |date=2003-10-16 |accessdate=2007-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021234/http://media.www.hlrecord.org/media/storage/paper609/news/2003/10/16/Etc/Kill-Bill.Beauty.And.Violence-530854.shtml |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critics analyzing violent film images that seek to aesthetically please the viewer mainly fall into two categories. Critics who see depictions of violence in film as superficial and exploitative argue that it leads audience members to become desensitized to brutality, thus increasing their aggression. On the other hand, critics who view violence as a type of content, or as a theme, claim it is cathartic and provides "acceptable outlets for anti-social impulses".&lt;ref name="bruder"/&gt;

Adrian Martin argues that critics who hold violent cinema in high regard have developed a response to anti-violence advocates, "those who decry everything from ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' to ''[[Terminator 2]]'' as dehumanising, desensitising cultural influences". Martin claims that critics who value aestheticized violence defend shocking depictions onscreen on the grounds that "screen violence is not real violence, and should never be confused with it". He claims that their rebuttal also claims that "movie violence is fun, spectacle, make-believe; it's dramatic metaphor, or a necessary catharsis akin to that provided by [[Jacobean theatre]]; it's generic, pure sensation, pure fantasy. It has its own changing history, its codes, its precise aesthetic uses."&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Adrian |year=2000 |title=The Offended Critic: Film Reviewing and Social Commentary |journal=Senses of Cinema |volume= |issue=8 |pages= |issn=1443-4059 |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/8/offended.html |format=Archive |accessdate=2007-06-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519074902/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/00/8/offended.html |archivedate=2007-05-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Bruder]], a film studies professor at Indiana University and the author of ''Aestheticizing Violence, or How To Do Things with Style,'' proposes that there is a distinction between aestheticized violence and the use of gore and blood in mass market action or war films. She argues that "aestheticized violence is not merely the excessive use of violence in a film". Movies such as the popular action film ''[[Die Hard 2]]'' are very violent, but they do "not fall into the category of aestheticized violence because it is not stylistically excessive in a significant and sustained way".&lt;ref name="bruder" /&gt;

But Bruder classifies films as using "stylized [e.g. aestheticized] violence if they "revel in guns, gore and explosions, exploiting [[mise-en-scene]] not so much to provide narrative environment as to create the appearance of a 'movie' atmosphere against which specifically cinematic spectacle can unfold". In movies with aestheticized violence, she argues that the "standard realist modes of editing and cinematography are violated in order to spectacularize the action being played out on the screen"; directors use "quick and awkward editing", "canted framings", shock cuts, and slow motion, to emphasize the impacts of bullets or the "spurting of blood".&lt;ref name="bruder" /&gt;

For viewers of films with aestheticized violence, such as [[John Woo]]'s movies, she claims that "One of the many pleasures" from watching Woo's films, such as ''[[Hard Target]]'' is that it gets viewers to recognize how Woo plays with conventions "from other Woo films" and how it "connects up with films...which include imitations of or homages to Woo". Bruder argues that films with aestheticized violence such as "''Hard Target'', ''[[True Romance]]'' and ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'' are [filled] with... signs" and indicators, so that "the stylized violence they contain ultimately serves as...another interruption in the narrative drive" of the film.&lt;ref name="bruder" /&gt;

Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Dwight Garner reviews the controversy and [[moral panic]] surrounding the 1991 novel and 2000 film ''[[American Psycho]]'', which concerns [[Patrick Bateman]], "an Exeter and Harvard grad, a gourmand, a tanning enthusiast and a ruthless fashion critic" who is also a [[serial killer]]. Garner concludes that the film was a "coal-black satire" in which "dire comedy mixes with [[Grand Guignol]]. There's demented opera in some of its scenes." The book, meanwhile, has acquired "grudging respect" and is "seen as a transgressive bag of broken glass that can be talked about alongside plasma-soaked trips like Anthony Burgess's ''A Clockwork Orange''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Dwight |last= Garner |title= In Hindsight, an ‘American Psycho’ Looks a Lot Like Us |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/theater/in-hindsight-an-american-psycho-looks-a-lot-like-us.html |newspaper= The New York Times |date=2016-03-24 |accessdate=2016-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garner claims that the novel's author, [[Bret Easton Ellis]], "was racing ahead of the culture" and that his book "was ahead of its time": "The culture has shifted to make room for Bateman. We've developed a taste for barbaric libertines with twinkling eyes and some zing in their tortured souls. [[Tony Soprano]], [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] from "''[[Breaking Bad]]''", [[Hannibal Lecter]] (who predates "''American Psycho''")—here are the most significant pop culture characters of the past 30 years... Thanks to these characters, and to [[first-person shooter]] [[video games]], we’ve learned to identify with the bearer of violence and not just cower before him or her."

==History in art==

===Antiquity===
[[Plato]] proposed to ban poets from his [[The Republic (Plato)|ideal republic]] because he feared that their aesthetic ability to construct attractive [[narrative]]s about immoral behaviour would corrupt young minds. Plato's writings refer to poetry as a kind of [[rhetoric]], whose "...influence is pervasive and often harmful". Plato believed that poetry that was "unregulated by philosophy is a danger to soul and community". He warned that tragic poetry can produce "a disordered psychic regime or constitution" by inducing "a dream-like, uncritical state in which we lose ourselves in ...sorrow, grief, anger, [and] resentment". As such, Plato was in effect arguing that "What goes on in the theater, in your home, in your fantasy life, are connected" to what one does in real life.&lt;ref name="griswold"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Griswold |first= Charles |editor= Edward N.

[[Aristotle]], though, advocated a useful role for music, drama, and tragedy: a way for people to purge their negative emotions. Aristotle mentions [[catharsis]] at the end of his ''Politics'', where he notes that after people listen to music that elicits pity and fear, they "are liable to become possessed" by these negative emotions. However, afterwards, Aristotle points out that these people return to "a normal condition as if they had been medically treated and undergone a purge [catharsis]&amp;nbsp;... All experience a certain purge [catharsis] and pleasant relief. In the same manner cathartic melodies give innocent joy to men" (from ''Politics'' VIII:7; 1341b 35-1342a 8).&lt;ref name="dhi"&gt;{{cite book |editor= Philip P.

[[File:FallOfTheDamnedBosch.jpg|right|upright|thumb|''[[Fall of the Damned into Hell]]'']]
The artist [[Hieronymus Bosch]], from the 15th and 16th centuries, used images of demons, half-human animals and machines to evoke fear and confusion to portray the evil of man. The 16th-century artist [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] depicted "...the nightmarish imagery that reflect, if in an extreme fashion, popular dread of the [[Apocalypse]] and Hell".&lt;ref name="alsford"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/lcdth_i.html |title= Death - Introductory essay |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |last= Alsford |first= Stephen |date= 2004-02-29 |work= Florilegium Urbanum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-18th century, [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]], an Italian etcher, archaeologist and architect active from 1740, did imaginary etchings of prisons that depicted people "stretched on racks or trapped like rats in maze-like dungeons", an "aestheticization of violence and suffering".&lt;ref&gt;

[[Laurent Tailhade]] is reputed to have stated, after [[Auguste Vaillant]] bombed the Chamber of Deputies in 1893: "{{lang|fr|Qu'importent les victimes, si le geste est beau?}} [What do the victims matter, so long as the gesture is beautiful]." In 1929 [[André Breton]]'s Second Manifesto on [[surrealist art]] stated that "{{lang|fr|L’acte surréaliste le plus simple consiste, revolvers aux poings, à descendre dans la rue et à tirer au hasard, tant qu’on peut, dans la foule}}" [The simplest Surrealist act consists of running down into the street, pistols in hand, and firing blindly, as fast as you can pull the trigger, into the crowd]."&lt;ref name="dworkin" /&gt;

==Theories and semiotic analysis==
{{Semiotics}}

===Baudrillard===
French [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] theorist [[Jean Baudrillard]] argues that whereas modern societies were "...organized around the production and consumption of [[commodification|commodities]]", "postmodern societies are organized around simulation and the play of images and [[semiotics|signs]]". As such, in "...the postmodern media and consumer society, everything becomes an image, a sign, a spectacle". For Baudrillard, the West's "commercialization of the whole world...will turn out rather to have been the aestheticization of the whole world—its cosmopolitan spectacularization, its transformation into images, its semiological organization". As a result, the "previously separate domains of the [[economy]], art, politics, and sexuality" become "collapsed into each other", and art penetrates "all spheres of existence." Thus, Baudrillard argues that "[o]ur society has given rise to a general aestheticization: all forms of culture—not excluding anti-cultural ones—are promoted and all models of representation and anti-representation are taken on board".&lt;ref name="kellner"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Kellner |first= Douglas |editor= Edward N. Zalta |encyclopedia= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title= Jean Baudrillard |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2005/entries/baudrillard/ |accessdate= 2007-06-08 |edition= Summer 2005 |date= 2005-08-22 |publisher= The Metaphysics Research Lab, Center for the Study of Language and Information, [[Stanford University]] |location= Stanford, CA |issn= 1095-5054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semiotic analysis===

====Still images====
When a person views an isolated painting, photograph or cartoon, they are viewing a static image. If a photographer takes a still photo of a police officer's struggle to arrest a young man, for example, the [[denotation (Semiotics)|denotative]] meaning might be "there was a man dressed as a police officer placing his hand on the shoulder of another man of a certain age whilst a photographer took a picture". On the other hand, the [[connotation (semiotics)|connotative]] meanings might range from, "law enforcement in action" to "a heroic fight to subdue a dangerous terrorist about to release [[sarin gas]]", to "police use excessive force to arrest non-violent protesters", to "fancy dress party ends badly".  The attribution of the specific [[subtext]] is left to the caption writer, the text accompanying the photo, and the audience.

Critic [[Susan Sontag]] argued that, through repeated exposure, certain well-known photographs have become "ethical reference points", such as the many images depicting the victims and liberation of the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] (1977).  From this perspective, the subtext of such images, though still connotatively open to interpretation, has been somewhat restrained by familiarity, predominant cultural beliefs regarding the [[Holocaust]], and perhaps by overusage.

=====News reporting=====
If there is a motion picture or video recording of the previously described scenario of a police officer arresting a man, the filmmakers, videographers, and editors may reframe this scene, by fragmenting the recording, depicting it from different vantage points, editing the material, and reassembling these components. A film editor can produce a non-[[realism (arts)|realistic]] sequence of intercut, edited images, which forces the audience to interpret those images according to a different set of [[semiotic]] rules. Even without editing or alteration, a film or video recordings' ''[[mise en scène]]'' and non-verbal signs become much more explicit and enable the audience to attribute meaning to the scenario.
 
The [[value (Semiotics)|value]] of this video as a [[Sign (semiotics)|signifier]] will be determined by its relation to the other signifiers in the system. Thus, if the video is included in a reputable television news program, it will acquire a greater claim to be indexical and its status is more likely to be considered reliable "evidence" of real world events. In semiotic terms, the words spoken by the television presenter will be symbolic, and the images will have both iconic and indexical qualities.

The "semiotic value" of the video will change if it is transposed into a polemical or satirical programme, presented by a commentator, or screened with on-screen captions (e.g., "Crime Wave in the Streets", or "Protesters Brutalized by Police"). These substitute contexts form [[modality (semiotics)|modality]] indicators that may help the viewer to assess the plausibility, credibility, or truthfulness of the content. The violence shown on-screen can be '''aestheticized''' by the values of the symbolical signs used by the news presenter, by captions placed on-screen, or by the relations with other signifiers in the same programme (e.g., if the arrest video is preceded by a report about "antisocial and criminal behaviour").

=====Fictional film or video=====
If a film or television director staged a similar fictional scene, the audience will be predisposed to consider it less "real". They know that the scenario is being filtered through the film maker's sensibilities and the outcome will reflect the director's motives. Hence, the lighting, makeup, costumes, acting methods, cutting, and [[soundtrack]] music selection are understood to be combined to inform the audience about the film maker's intentions.

The [[culture industry]]'s mass-produced texts and images about crime, violence, and war have been consolidated into [[genres]]. Film makers typically choose from a predictable range of narrative [[Convention (norm)|convention]]s and use [[stereotype]]d  characters, and [[cliché]]d symbols and metaphors. Over time, certain styles and conventions of filming and editing are standardised within a medium or a genre. Some conventions tend to naturalise the content and  make it seem more real. Other methods deliberately breach convention to create an effect, such as the canted angles, rapid edits, and slow motion shots used in films with aestheticized violence.

=====Analysis of selected films=====
{{refimprove|date=February 2016}}
* ''[[The Accused (1988 film)|The Accused]]'': In this 1988 film, filmmaker [[Jonathan Kaplan]] stages a graphic rape scene to consider the moral and legal quality of the fictional spectators who, while not engaging in the rape, nevertheless shouted encouragement to those that were.
* ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'': Matthew Crowder analyzes the aestheticization of violence in ''Strange Days'', a film by director [[Kathryn Bigelow]] (1995). A scene graphically depicts the rape of a woman; it is "...filmed in real-time using a first-person subjective camera". ''Strange Days'' tells the story of Lenny Nero, who sells an illegal, futuristic technology that allows people to record their sensory experiences onto a minidisc, so that other people can "play back" these sensory experiences and have them "wired" directly into their brain.
**In the film, Max records his rape of Iris, and gives the recording to the unsuspecting Lenny. When the "perpetrator of violence [Max] is given control of the cinematic apparatus", this is "referencing films such as ''Peeping Tom'' (Michael Powell, 1959) and ''Halloween'' (Carpenter, 1978)". Like "''Peeping Tom's'' psychopathic killer, Max does seem to see himself as some kind of artist, recording the rape and sending it to Lenny". 
**The "...first person perspective the filming of the rape scene is unrelenting, the camera never turns away from the fear and panic of Iris whose body is not only slung about by the unknown killer but also subjected to an unflinching gaze that the audience is punished with too, made complicit in the rape by their passivity". Crowder argues that "[t]he entire notion of the subjective camera—an aesthetic element of the film—its scopophilic, voyeuristic and sadistic nature, is revealed in all its depravity". As such, "[t]he aesthetic experience of the [rape] scene is one of shock, horror, dislocation and passivity at the way the camera represents the helpless body of Iris as no more than an object".
**The film's use of "playback" clips, as in the rape scene, causes a "...stylistic disruption of Hollywood codes and an even more important aesthetic effect: the disruption of the normal codes of identification with character and narrative".&lt;ref name="crowder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savingtheworld.co.uk/showPage.php?page=22 |title=Aesthetics and Politics: Strange Days |accessdate=2007-06-08 |last=Crowder |first=Matthew |year=2006 |work=Saving The World |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822044114/http://www.savingtheworld.co.uk/showPage.php?page=22 |archivedate=2007-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Bigelow was criticized for the rape scene by [[Carla Peterson (academic)|Carla Peterson]], in her article "Director joins boys' club -- and it only costs her compassion" (1995).  Crowder claims that Peterson attacked ''Strange Days'' "... as misogynist and offensive because she [Peterson] feels that it tries to create an unproblematic, if slightly uncomfortable, spectacle out of rape". As such, Crowder argues that Peterson "... fails to see that the film concerns more than a logical narrative (which if anything grows increasingly incoherent)" and claims that Peterson has "...misread the scene out of context" and dismissed "...textual elements that clearly signal criticism of both Hollywood and the cinematic apparatus as a tool of masculinist domination".
**Crowder "challenge[s] whether Peterson's response is actually aesthetic, as she makes little reference to communication between work and audience". In contrast, Crowder interprets ''Strange Days'' in a feminist context, which he argues is "...perhaps its most persuasive aesthetic effect". Crowder holds that "...''Strange Days'' can be seen as a self-conscious discourse on cinema and that part of this discourse concerns the act of aesthetic judgement". Furthermore, he states that the film's "narrative can be seen to allegorise the problem of aesthetics and value".&lt;ref name="crowder" /&gt;
* ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'': ''A Clockwork Orange'' is a 1971 film written, directed, and produced by [[Stanley Kubrick]] and based on the novel of the same name by [[Anthony Burgess]]. Set in a futuristic England (circa 1995, as imagined in 1965), it follows the life of a teenage gang leader named Alex. In Alexander Cohen's analysis of Kubrick's film, he argues that the "ultra-violence" of the young protagonist, Alex, "...represents the breakdown of culture itself". In the film, gang members are "...[s]eeking idle de-contextualized violence as entertainment" as an escape from the emptiness of their [[dystopia]]n society.
**Cohen claims that in the film, "...the violence of modern technology sees its reflection in Ultraviolence, beyond violence". When the protagonist murders a woman in her home, Cohen states that Kubrick presents a "[s]cene of aestheticized death" by setting the murder in a room filled with "...modern art which depict scenes of sexual intensity and bondage"; as such, the scene depicts a "...struggle between high-culture which has aestheticized violence and sex into a form of autonomous art, and the very image of post-modern mastery".&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinemaspace.berkeley.edu/Cinema_Beyond/C_B.lectures/ClockworkOrange/Benj_CultIndustr_Clckwrk.html |title=Clockwork Orange and the Aestheticization of Violence |accessdate=2007-06-08 |last=Cohen |first=Alexander J. |year=1998 |publisher=UC Berkeley Program in Film Studies |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515160450/http://cinemaspace.berkeley.edu/Cinema_Beyond/C_B.lectures/ClockworkOrange/Benj_CultIndustr_Clckwrk.html |archivedate=2007-05-15 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ashurbanipal''''', also known as the '''Ashurbanipal Monument''' or the '''Statue of Ashurbanipal''',&lt;ref name=AIM&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atour.com/history/landmarks/20120808d.html|title=1988: USA, California, San Jose: The Ashurbanipal Monument|date=August 8, 2012|accessdate=August 9, 2013|publisher=Assyrian Information Management}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[bronze sculpture]] by [[Fred Parhad]], an artist of [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] descent. It is located in the [[Civic Center, San Francisco|Civic Center]] of [[San Francisco]], [[California]], in the United States. The {{Convert|15|ft|adj=on}} [[statue]] depicting the Assyrian [[Ashurbanipal|king of the same name]] was commissioned by the Assyrian Foundation for the Arts and presented to the City of San Francisco in 1988 as a gift from the [[Assyrian people]]. The sculpture reportedly cost $100,000 and was the first "sizable" bronze statue of Ashurbanipal.&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt; It is administered by the City and County of San Francisco and the [[San Francisco Arts Commission]].

Parhad's work was met with some criticism by local Assyrians, who argued it was inaccurate to portray Ashurbanipal holding a [[clay tablet]] and a lion, or wearing a [[skirt]]. The critics thought the statue looked more like the [[Sumer]]ian king [[Gilgamesh]]; Renee Kovacs, a "scholar and self-stated Assyriologist", believed the sculpture depicted neither figure, but rather a [[Mesopotamia]]n "protective figure". Parhad defended the accuracy of his work, while also admitting that he took [[Artistic license|artistic liberties]].&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Hero lion Dur-Sharrukin Louvre AO19862.jpg|thumb|left|Possible representation of Enkidu as [[Master of Animals]] grasping a lion and snake, in an [[Assyrian palace relief]], from [[Dur-Sharrukin]], now Louvre]]
In [[Assyrian sculpture]], the famous colossal entrance way guardian figures of ''[[lamassu]]'' were often accompanied by a hero grasping a wriggling lion with one hand and typically a snake with the other, also colossal and in high relief; these are generally the only other types of high relief in Assyrian sculpture.  They continue the [[Master of Animals]] tradition in Mesopotamian art, and may represent [[Enkidu]], a central figure in the [[Ancient Mesopotamia]]n ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.  In the palace of [[Sargon II]] at [[Khorsabad]], a group of at least seven ''lamassu'' and two such heroes with lions surrounded the entrance to the "throne room", "a concentration of figures which produced an overwhelming impression of power."&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Frankfort|Frankfort, Henri]], ''The Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient'', pp. 147-148, 148 quoted, Pelican History of Art, 4th ed 1970, Penguin (now Yale History of Art), {{ISBN|0140561072}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The arrangement was repeated in [[Sennacherib]]'s palace at [[Nineveh]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, John M., Section 6.

==History==
''Ashurbanipal'' was designed by Fred Parhad, an [[Iraq]]i-born artist of [[Assyria]]n descent. Parhad rejected formal arts studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and relocated to New York, where the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] allowed him to study its Assyrian collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caroun.com/Sculpture/Artists/USA/FredParhad/FredParhad.html|title=Fred Parhad|accessdate=August 9, 2013|publisher=Caroun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was commissioned by the Assyrian Foundation for the Arts under the direction of its president, [[Narsai David]].&lt;ref name=Ishaya&gt;{{Cite journal|work=Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies|first=Arianne|last=Ishaya|title=Settling Into Diaspora: A History of Urmia Assyrians in the United States|accessdate=August 9, 2013|year=2006|volume=20|number=1|page=26|url=http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v20n1/Arianne-diaspora.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assyrian Universal Alliance Foundation also claims to have commissioned the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.auaf.us/Who%20is%20who/Art/Art.htm |title=Who Is Who |publisher=Assyrian Universal Alliance Foundation |accessdate=August 9, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200831/http://www.auaf.us/Who%20is%20who/Art/Art.htm |archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Funds were collected from [[Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac Americans|Assyrians throughout the United States]].&lt;ref name=Fernandez&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19871228&amp;id=1v4yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=efwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6964,9530701|title=Statue of Assyrian king in skirt stirs controversy|work=[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Telegraph]]|location=Nashua, New Hampshire|volume=119|number=228|oclc=22532489|first=Elizabeth|last=Fernandez|date=December 31, 1987|accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, ''[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Telegraph]]'' reported that the work cost $100,000 and was the first "sizable" bronze statue of [[Ashurbanipal]].&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt; It was presented to the City of San Francisco as a gift from the [[Assyrian people]] on May 29, 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.batw.org/articles/georgia-hesse_december-2012/|title="Promoting Yourself in the Digital Age" – by Georgia I.

The {{Convert|8|ft|adj=on}} [[patina]]ted [[bronze]] statue,&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt; mounted on a base and a [[plinth]] to reach a total height of {{Convert|15|ft}}, weighs approximately {{Convert|1800|lb}}. It depicts Ashurbanipal, the Assyrian king known for building the eponymously named [[Library of Ashurbanipal]], the first and largest library in [[Nineveh]].&lt;ref name=Ishaya/&gt; The bearded king is shown wearing [[earring]]s and a [[tunic]]; he is holding a book (or [[clay tablet]]) in one arm and a lion cub in the other.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt; According to the Historical Marker Database, the tablet reads in [[cuneiform]]: "Peace unto heaven and earth / Peace unto countries and cities / Peace unto the dwellers in all lands / This is the statue presented to the City of San Francisco by the Assyrian people in the 210th year of America's sovereignty".&lt;ref name=HMD&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=32080|title=Ashurbanipal Monument|accessdate=August 9, 2013|publisher=Historical Marker Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "larger-than-life", full length statue stands above a plinth adorned with a lotus blossom design and a [[concrete]] base with an [[anti-graffiti coating]].&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt; The base includes rosettes and a bronze plaque.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt; One inscription below the statue reads the text of the tablet in English, [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] cuneiform and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. The text "Ashurbanipal, King of Assyria, 669–627 B.C." appears above and the text "Dedicated May 29, 1988" appears below, both in English.&lt;ref name=HMD/&gt; Another inscription below the statue reads, "Presented to the City of San Francisco by the Assyrian Foundation for the Arts through donations of American Assyrian Association of San Francisco / Assyrian American National Federation", followed by a list of names of donors.&lt;ref name=HMD/&gt; In December 2010, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reported that a large plaque from the sculpture was missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Passenger-climbs-aboard-needles-and-all-2453277.php|title=Passenger climbs aboard, needles and all|date=December 17, 2010|first= Leah|last=Garchik|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=August 9, 2013|issn=1932-8672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:San Francisco Civic Center Historic District 11.jpg|thumb|right|The statue, mounted on its base in front of the [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Asian Art Museum]], in 2011]]

In December 1987, as news began to circulate about the commissioned work, local Assyrians accused Parhad of misrepresenting Ashurbanipal. Criticisms included the depiction of the king holding both a book and a lion, which they argued he "wouldn't do", and for dressing him in a skirt, which they claimed he would never have worn.&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt; The critics thought the statue made a better portrayal of the [[Sumer]]ian king [[Gilgamesh]]. One critic said: &lt;blockquote&gt;It's very simple. The statue represents Gilgamesh.... No Assyrian has a right to imagine things about our king. It's exactly like making a copy of the Statue of Liberty and saying it is George Washington.... Assyrian kings didn't wear miniskirts. They wouldn't have been holding a lion or a book. It's an insult to the Assyrians.&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Narsai David responded: &lt;blockquote&gt;They are entitled to their opinion.... We have never said this is a museum-quality reproduction.... We have always said this is a characterization of Ashurbanipal as done by a 20th-century artist. If they choose to think of this as Gilgamesh, they are free to do so.&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Renee Kovacs, a "scholar and self-stated Assyriologist", said the statue depicted neither Ashurbanipal or Gilgamesh, but rather a [[Mesopotamia]]n "protective figure, like a guard."&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt; Parhad defended the accuracy of his work, while also admitting that he took [[Artistic license|artistic liberties]] and attempted to incorporate the various aspects of Assyrian culture, from its hunting mastery to its admiration for writing. He said of the sculpture: &lt;blockquote&gt;The piece has authentic qualities to it, but it is also my statue.... With the earrings and the clothing and the hair and his daggers, it is Ashurbanipal. But in the choice of (stance), the fact that he is holding a tablet and a lion, that is mine. I wanted myself to be represented in the piece.&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Gebrüder Adam - Maler.jpg|thumb|250px|The Adam Brothers (1848), by Benno Adam, on the left.]]
'''Benno Rafael Adam''' (15 July 1812, [[Munich]] - 8 March 1892, [[Kelheim]]) was a German animal painter.

==Life==
He was the eldest son of the painter [[Albrecht Adam]], and distinguished himself especially by his depictions of game animals, hunting dogs and pets in larger compositions (deer and boar hunting, fox baiting, etc.) He was associated with the [[Chiemsee]] artists' colony.

In addition to his paintings, he illustrated several textbooks and manuals, including ''Anleitung zur Rindviehzucht und zur verschiedenartigen Benutzung des Hornviehs'' (Guide to Beef Cattle Breeding and the Diverse Use of Horned Cattle) by [[Heinrich Wilhelm von Pabst]], J. G. Cotta, Stuttgart (1851).

In the summer of 1834, he married Josepha Quaglio, the eldest daughter of the painter and architect [[Domenico Quaglio the Younger|Domenico Quaglio]]. Their son [[Emil Adam]] also became a painter. Benno Adam's brothers were the painters [[Franz Adam|Franz]] and [[Eugen Adam]].

The '''Bergen Performing Arts Center''' ('''BergenPAC''') is a non-for-profit [[theater]] in Englewood, New Jersey. There are dance, theater, voice, and music classes offered year round at The Performing Arts School at BergenPAC. BergenPAC is a leader in world class cultural and educational though participating board, staff, volunteers, and partners.
 
== History ==
The theater originally opened as the Englewood Plaza movie theater on November 22, 1926 and remained a theater until the organization United Artists purchased the building in 1967, keeping its doors open through 1973. For a few years following the Plaza’s closing, the building remained vacant until a small group of local citizens under the leadership of John Harms worked to bring the John Harms Center to life on October 10, 1976 when Russian pianist Lazar Berman performed at its debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boatagainstthecurrent.blogspot.nl/2014/01/photo-of-day-performing-arts-school.html|title=Photo of the Day: Performing Arts School, BergenPAC, Englewood NJ|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
John Harms, (1906-1981) an organist and teacher, began his career as an impresario in 1941, arranging concert appearances in North Jersey of both famous and lesser-known artists. A one-man operation, he selected and booked performers, rented the performance space, wrote press releases, and personally telephoned or corralled over 1,200 contacts. His dream of acquiring and running a concert hall of his own became a reality when The Englewood Plaza came on the market.
In the 1990s, two major renovation projects turned the Plaza into a modern concert hall and media facility, while simultaneously preserving the vintage acoustics that made it a unique sought-after performance and recording site. The John Harms Center was one of the largest performing arts centers in New Jersey and the largest arts center in northern New Jersey. Its ultimate closing on April 14, 2003 left a gaping hole in the area’s cultural life.
On April 30, 2003, through a public-private partnership, a small group of dedicated individuals reopened the doors as BergenPAC.

== Programming ==
Since the opening of BergenPAC's doors, a number of notable artists have appeared on the mainstage, including Tony Bennett, Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross, Ringo Starr, John Legend, Jerry Lewis, and Willie Nelson. There are approximately 200 performances throughout the year.

== The Performing Arts School at BergenPAC==
The former [[Englewood (Erie Railroad station)|Englewood train station]], once used as Bennett Studios, at One Depot Square now hosts BergenPAC's Performing Arts School. Students have the opportunity to perform on both the theater’s main stage and throughout the county. Programs extend to school districts and special needs for all ages, ranging from infant to adult.

The program offers classes year round for a number of disciplines, including, theater, art, vocal lessons, and dance and has been developed to accommodate the learning needs of young people ranging in age from two months to 21 years.

The band first came to prominence in 2010 with the release of the song "Liar Liar". At the time there were protests against a rise in college [[Tuition fees in the United Kingdom|tuition fees]] in the UK, and the song had attacked the [[coalition government]] of the time, led by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] and Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]].&lt;ref name="New Statesman Monks Kaufman"&gt;{{cite web

In 2017, the band again rose to prominence with the success of a reworked version of "Liar Liar", titled "[[Liar Liar GE2017]]". The song was released in the run-up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017]], with an accompanying video, that features music and vocals mixed with selected speeches and interviews by British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative politician]] and [[Prime Minister]] [[Theresa May]].&lt;ref name="MorningStar Staff"&gt;{{cite web

''The Guardian'' featured an opinion piece by Captain SKA songwriters Christy Kulz and Jake Painter, on 7 June 2017. Writing about the original song, "Liar Liar", they said that "It was a way to make politics more relevant and accessible to a wider audience, including young people, by challenging the 'I’m not into politics' refrain."&lt;ref name="Guardian Captain SKA 7/6/2017"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8489">[[File:Shabbat Challos.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Two homemade challahs placed on cutting board covered by an embroidered challah cover]]
A '''challah cover''' is a special cloth used to cover the two braided loaves ([[challah]]) set out on the table at the beginning of a [[Shabbat]] or [[Jewish holiday|Yom Tov]] meal. While its appearance lends a decorative and ceremonial aspect to the set table, its presence serves both a [[halakha|halakhic]] and symbolic function.

==Description==
[[File:Shabbat table setting.jpg|right|thumb|250px| A challah cover on a table set for Shabbat]]
[[File:Challah covers 1.jpg|thumb|Challah covers for sale outside a store in [[Jerusalem]]. The enscription on the top cover says "To honor Shabbat and Yom Tov". The enscription on the bottom says "To honor the holy Shabbat"]]
Challah covers may be made from any kind of fabric or paper. They are often hand or machine-[[embroidery|embroidered]], [[painting|painted]], [[applique]]d  or [[tie-dye]]d. They are sometimes adorned with fringes interwoven with silver or gold thread. The challah cover must be large enough to cover two braided loaves without allowing the bread to be seen through the sides, and opaque enough so that the loaves cannot be seen through the fabric. Store-bought challah covers often bear the inscription לכבוד שבת קדש ("To honor the holy Shabbat") or לכבוד שבת ויום טוב ("To honor Shabbat and Yom Tov").

==Halakhic function==
At the beginning of a Shabbat or holiday meal, a blessing ([[Kiddush]]) must preferably be made over the wine first in order to sanctify the Shabbat.&lt;ref&gt;Sefer HaChinuch, Positive Mitzvah #155,&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed by the blessing over the bread (challah), which begins the meal. However, in the hierarchy of blessings mandated by the Sages,&lt;ref&gt;Seder Birkat HaNehenin 10:13.&lt;/ref&gt; the blessing over bread should precede the blessing over wine. In order to preserve the priority of the wine, and not to "shame" the bread which should be blessed first,&lt;ref&gt;''Tur'', 271, quoting the Jerusalem Talmud.&lt;/ref&gt; the bread is “removed” by concealing it from view with the challah cover.

In the absence of a challah cover, one may use a napkin, [[doily]], tissues, or similar covering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aish.com/shabbatlaws/shabbatlaws/Shabbat_On-the-Go.asp Shabbat Laws: Shabbat On-the-Go]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
===Remembrance of the manna===
The placement of the challah under the challah cover and over the Shabbat tablecloth (or over a challah cutting board) also recalls the Biblical scene of the [[manna]] which the [[Israelite]]s ate every day following the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. When [[Moses]] told the people about the manna, he said that it would fall for them every day of the week. However, in deference to the holiness of Shabbat, the manna would not fall on that day. Instead, two portions of manna would fall on Friday, enough for that day and for the Shabbat ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 16:22-26). This is given as the reason for the use of two braided loaves at Shabbat and holiday meals, as the challahs represent the double portion of manna that fell in honor of Shabbat.

Each morning the Israelites found the manna in the fields, encased in two layers of dew to preserve its freshness. [[Rashi]] describes the way the manna was found:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus we see that the dew fell upon the ground and the manna fell upon it, and then dew fell again upon this, and so it was as though it were carefully packed in a chest (Rashi on [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 16:13, quoting Mechilta, Yoma 75b).&lt;ref&gt;Silbermann Chumash.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, we place the challahs beneath a challah cover and over a tablecloth (or challah board) to recreate the [[miracle]] of the manna at our own Shabbat tables.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tosafot]], Pesachim 100b.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Challah cover for Shabbat.jpg|thumb|Old challah cover, Boryslav, Poland abt. 1930]]
In [[Talmud]]ic times, food was served to banquet guests on three-legged trays rather tables. These trays were brought to each guest by waiters. On Shabbat, the trays would be brought out only after the Kiddush, to show that the meal was being served in honor of the Shabbat, which had just been sanctified by the recital of the Kiddush.&lt;ref&gt;Pesachim 100b.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, observers set the table with the challah, but cover it until the time when it would have been carried in, in Talmudic times. This demonstrates that the meal only begins after &amp;mdash; and because of &amp;mdash; the Kiddush.&lt;ref&gt;Tosafot, Pesachim 100b.&lt;/ref&gt;

Covering the challah so as not to "shame" it while the wine is being blessed has been cited as an object lesson for the importance of not shaming one's fellow humans. The following story is told about Rabbi [[Yisroel Salanter]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohrtorahstone.org.il/parsha/5763/mishpatim63.htm Shabbat Shalom: Parshat Mishpatim by Rabbi Shlomo Riskin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020161241/http://www.ohrtorahstone.org.il/parsha/5763/mishpatim63.htm |date=October 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Rabbi Yisroel was once stranded in [[Kovno]] for Shabbat. Everyone wanted to host him, but he chose to spend the Shabbat at the home of a baker who had no children to feed, so he would not take away anyone's portion of food. The baker was an observant Jew but hardly a man of intelligence.

As he ushered his esteemed guest into his house, he shouted at his wife, "Why are the challahs not covered? How many times must I remind you to cover the challahs?" The poor woman, recognizing her distinguished guest, hurried to cover the challahs with tears in her eyes.

When the baker asked Rabbi Yisroel to do the honors by reciting the Kiddush, the Rabbi first asked him, "Can you tell me why we cover the challahs?"

"Of course," replied the baker. "Every child knows the answer. When there are many different foods on the table, the first blessing is always made over the bread, after which no other blessing need be made. On Friday night, however, the first blessing has to be made over the wine. In order not to shame the challah, who expects the blessing to be made over her, we must cover her over until after the sanctification of the wine."

Rabbi Yisroel looked at the baker incredulously. "Why do your ears not hear what your mouth is saying?" he asked. "Do you think that our Jewish tradition does not understand that a piece of dough has no feelings and would never become embarrassed? Understand that our laws are trying to sensitize us to the feelings of human beings, our friends, our neighbors, and especially our wives!"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Matzo covers==
At the [[Passover]] [[Passover Seder|seder]], the [[matzos]] are also covered. Matzo covers differ from challah covers in that they can contain three "pockets" into which the three matzos (set out at the beginning of the Seder) are inserted.

According to the Gemara, matzo is called ''lechem oni'' (poor man's bread);&lt;ref&gt;''Pesachim'' 36a.&lt;/ref&gt; the Hebrew word ''oni'' (עוני) can also be construed as "answers," yielding, "bread upon which answers are spoken."&lt;ref&gt;Beit Yosef.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the matzos are uncovered during the telling of the story of the Jews' servitude in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. However, when the wine cups are raised to express praise to God for the [[The Exodus|redemption]], the matzos are covered so that they will not be "shamed", as one is giving preference to the wine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=p2qC-G9wR1EC&amp;pg=PA372&amp;lpg=PA372&amp;dq=uncover+matzah&amp;source=web&amp;ots=HODIWzQtpp&amp;sig=5gSz6pa6rgHd2h_VBPScqrdh5aM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result Gelbard, Shmuel Pinchas (2000).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1682">In [[Classical Athens|Attic]] drama, the '''coryphaeus''', '''corypheus''', or '''koryphaios''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] κορυφαῖος ''koryphaîos'', from κορυφή ''koryphḗ́'', the top of the head) was the leader of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]]. Hence the term (sometimes in an Anglicized form "'''coryphe'''") is used for the chief or leader of any company or movement. The coryphaeus spoke for all the rest, whenever the chorus took part in the action, in quality of a person of the drama, during the course of the acts.

The term is sometimes used for the chief or principal of any company, corporation, sect, opinion, etc. Thus, [[Eustathius of Antioch]] is called the coryphaeus of the [[First Council of Nicaea]], and [[Cicero]] calls [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] the coryphaeus of the [[Stoicism|Stoics]].

[[Paul the Apostle]] is often entitled Coryphaeus in Christian [[iconography]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In 1856 at the [[University of Oxford]], the office of Coryphaeus or Praecentor was founded, whose duty it was to lead the musical performances directed by the [[Choragus]]. The office ceased to exist in 1899.

In Solzhenitsyn’s [[The First Circle|First Circle]], Stalin is often referred to as Coryphaeus, meaning that he speaks for all in the Soviet Union.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4502">{{for|the medical term|Entoptic phenomenon}}

In archaeology, the term '''entoptic phenomena''' relates to visual experiences derived from within the eye or brain (as opposed to externally, as in normal vision). In this respect they differ slightly from the medical definition, which defines entoptic phenomena as only applying to sources within the eye, not the brain. To avoid this confusion, the term '''subjective visual phenomena''' is sometimes used. ''Entoptic'' was chosen by author David Lewis Williams due to its origin from [[Greek language|Greek]] meaning "coming from within".&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a great deal of work trying to find evidence of motifs and compositions derived from entoptic phenomena in [[prehistoric art]], especially [[rock art]] and [[megalithic art]]. The justification of this research is that entoptic phenomena normally occur during [[Altered state of consciousness|states of altered consciousness]], the practice of which may impact our views of ancient religious and social practice. The importance of looking outside traditional methods of research for interpreting [[prehistoric]] cultures is made more so due to the lack of abundant data which makes current cultural studies viable. "Art and the ability to comprehend it are more dependent on kinds of mental imagery and the ability to manipulate mental images than on intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

==David Lewis-Williams's system==
===Stage 1===
Experiences include [[geometric]] visual patterns such as dots, zagging lines, as well as grid patterns which are all common shapes which are universally understood by the human condition.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 121&lt;/ref&gt; These patterns and shapes can be seen without aid of [[psychotropic]] substances but under their influence the heightened effects precipitate modes of altered consciousness. Entoptic experiences differ from [[hallucination]]s in that they are a purely visual phenomenon, while hallucinations represent experience of culturally occurring themes as well as physical coming from the five senses.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage 2===
Entoptic Phenomena are interpreted in ways that can be understood, matched to objects or ideas that may be familiar in day-to-day life and may also be attributed to the individuals state such as hunger, sexual arousal, or anxiety and fear.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Placing objects in reality from base shapes seen under influence from pscychotropics which link to [[Somatic symptom disorder|somatic]] physical responses lead now to full hallucinations. The relation between the first stage entoptic image and later stage full hallucinations are not mutually exclusive, both may be present.

===Stage 3===
Stage 3 images become iconic, relating to themes from the subjects life and become linked to powerful emotional experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphor and simile give way to the belief that objects are exactly what they appear to be "subject losing insight into the differences between literal and analogical meanings"&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 128&lt;/ref&gt; These stages may not always be sequential, and all stages may not be experienced depending on the subject and of course the type of psychotropic being used.

Williams notes that altered states are and their resulting impact on human [[consciousness]] is often marginalized within state, scientific, and religious realms.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 121&lt;/ref&gt; "The contemporary Western emphasis on the supreme value of intelligence has tended to suppress certain forms of consciousness and to regard them as irrational, marginal,aberrant or even pathological and thereby to eliminate them from investigations of the deep past."&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2002, pp. 121&lt;/ref&gt; As with any well rounded approach to cultural or historical study, all aspects of the human condition must be explored, especially when such exploration takes us outside of our usual cultural perspective.

{{Collecting Hobby}}
'''Ephemera''' (singular: '''ephemeron''') are any transitory written or printed matter not meant to be retained or preserved. The word derives from the Greek ''ephemeros'', meaning "lasting only one day, short-lived".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ephemera&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[collectible]] ephemera are advertising [[trade cards]], [[air sickness bag|airsickness bags]], [[bookmark]]s, catalogues, [[greeting cards]], letters, [[pamphlet]]s, [[postcard]]s, [[poster]]s, [[Prospectus (finance)|prospectuses]], defunct [[stock certificate]]s or [[Ticket (admission)|ticket]]s, and [[zine]]s.

==Etymology==
Ephemera (ἐφήμερα) is a noun, the plural neuter of ephemeron and ephemeros, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[New Latin]] for ἐπί – epi "on, for" and ἡμέρα – hemera "day" with the ancient sense extending to the [[mayfly]] and other short lived insects and flowers and for something which lasts a day or a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ephemera | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ephemera | publisher=The Free Dictionary | accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Printed ephemera==
[[File:Stallion Phoenomenon.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 1798 printed [[Broadside (printing)|broadside]] advertising the availability of a [[stallion]] for horse-breeding]]
In [[library and information science]], the term ephemera also describes the class of published single-sheet or single page documents which are meant to be thrown away after one use. This classification excludes simple letters and photographs with no printing on them, which are considered [[manuscript]]s or [[typescript]]s.  Large academic and [[national library|national libraries]] and museums may collect, organize, and preserve ephemera as [[history]]. A particularly large and important example of such an archive is the John Johnson Collection of Printed Ephemera&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/johnson/johnson.htm Bodley.ox.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Bodleian Library]], [[Oxford]]. Over 2,000 images from the John Johnson Collection are available to search online for free at [[VADS (organisation)|VADS]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vads.ac.uk/results.php?cmd=advsearch&amp;words=john+johnson&amp;field=all&amp;oper=or&amp;words2=&amp;field2=all&amp;mode=boolean&amp;submit=search&amp;JJPP=1&amp;JJTP=1 VADS (the Visual Arts Data Service)]&lt;/ref&gt; and more than 65,000 items are available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://johnjohnson.chadwyck.co.uk/marketing.do Johnjohnson.chadwyck.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;  The extensive [[Laura Seddon Greeting Card Collection]] from the [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] gathers 32,000 [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] greeting cards and 450 [[Valentine's Day]] cards dating from the early nineteenth century, printed by the major publishers of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = MMU Special Collections - Victorian Ephemera| publisher = [[Manchester Metropolitan University]]| date = | url =http://www.specialcollections.mmu.ac.uk/victoria.php| author = |accessdate = November 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ephemera Kabinett at the Los-Angeles–based [[Institute of Cultural Inquiry]] contains 'first' items from cultural turning points of the last two decades, such as a copy of the first [[Marvel Comics|Marvel comic]] in which a lead character comes out of the closet and one of the first [[Red ribbon|AIDS red ribbons]].&lt;ref&gt;Florenkowsky, Emilie. [http://www.meta-magazine.com/articles/inquiry-into-the-institute-of-cultural-inquiry "Inquiry into the Institute of Cultural Inquiry."] Meta magazine, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video and audio ephemera==
By extension, '''video ephemera''' and '''audio ephemera''' refer to transitory audiovisual matter not intended to be retained or preserved.  Surprisingly, the great bulk of video and audio expression has, until recently, been ephemeral.  Early TV broadcasts were not preserved (indeed, the technology to preserve them postdates the invention of television).  Even if radio and television stations preserve archives of their broadcasts, those backcatalogs are inaccessible in practice to the general public, leaving it to a small number of underground [[tape trading|tape traders]] to exchange the rare, lucky moments when something unexpected or historical came across the air.

An article on the Ephemera Society of America website notes
&lt;blockquote&gt;Printed ephemera gave way to audio and video ephemera in the twentieth century. ... These present even more of a preservation problem than printed materials. Although seldom made available for libraries, when videotapes are acquired for archival preservation they are found to be made on low quality tape, poorly processed, and damaged from abuse by users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ephemerasociety.org/articles/lla-phillips.html "'I Like Ike': Collecting Political Ephemera", Faye Philips]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The large capacity and reach provided by resources such as the [[Internet Archive#Media collections|Internet Archive]] and [[YouTube]] have made finding and sharing video ephemera (past and present) dramatically easier.

By the end of January 1945 she had made 870 broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Radio: G.I.

==Background==
Jill was born '''Martha Wilkerson''', but she never gave her real name on the air, nor did listeners know that she was married and had a young family. Mort Werner, her husband, was an executive in broadcasting and advertising, and he produced some of her programs.&lt;ref name="tafn"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IiOxfHGscgcC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=%22GI+Jill%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiphq3ehv7WAhUBQiYKHSRvBKsQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22GI%20Jill%22&amp;f=false|title="This is the American Forces Network": The Anglo-American Battle of the Air Waves in World War II|last1=Morley|first1=Patrick|date=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275969011|pages=73–74|language=en|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had a brother who was a lieutenant in the Navy, and her inability to get letters through to him led to the development of her broadcasts.&lt;ref name=y/&gt;

Like an actress playing a role, Wilkerson considered Jill a separate entity. In 1966, she told a reporter: "The men overseas created Jill. They made her what they wanted her to be — the girl back home."&lt;ref name=ig/&gt;

==''Jack and Jill''==
Assuming that other servicemen had similar problems receiving mail from the folks back home, Jill conceived a radio program that featured recorded music and friendly talk. Officials in the [[United States Office of War Information]] approved the idea, and the ''Jack and Jill'' show was born featuring Jill and her husband. When he entered the Army, Jill began doing the program as a solo host. The show was broadcast from San Francisco via [[shortwave radio]]. An article in ''[[Yank, the Army Weekly]]'' noted, "For a long time, Army authorities admit, Jill's program was the only link the men at Guadal[canal] had with the folks back home."&lt;ref name="y"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Neill|first1=Sgt. James P.|title=GI Jill|journal=Yank, the Army Weekly|date=December 7, 1945|volume=4|issue=25|page=4|url=https://archive.org/stream/1945-12-07YankMagazine#page/n3/mode/1up|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to popular recordings of the time, Jill's broadcasts included birth announcements and her reading letters to military men from their wives. Eventually, AFRS officials realized the popularity of Jill's program and moved her to Los Angeles, where she began broadcasting ''GI Jive'' daily over 400 Army radio stations.&lt;ref name=y/&gt;

==''GI Jive''==
Jill, with her commentary and records, was sometimes called "America's answer to Tokyo Rose"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spragg|first1=Dennis M.|title=Glenn Miller Declassified|date=2017|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=9781612349534|page=22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uMgtDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=%22GI+Jill%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiphq3ehv7WAhUBQiYKHSRvBKsQ6AEIaTAL#v=onepage&amp;q=%22GI%20Jill%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Axis Sally]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sterling|first1=Christopher H.|title=Encyclopedia of Radio 3-Volume Set|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135456498|page=236|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UeveLMilioC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;dq=%22GI+Jill%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiphq3ehv7WAhUBQiYKHSRvBKsQ6AEImQEwEw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22GI%20Jill%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Jill said later that was not the point because American servicemen didn't take broadcasters like Tokyo Rose and Axis Sally seriously. "Our men — those who listened to enemy propaganda — only listened because there was nothing else to do," she said.&lt;ref name=ig/&gt;

In his memoir, ''An American Adventure: From Early Aviation through Three Wars to the White House'', diplomat and National Security Council member William Lloyd Stearman reflected on hearing Jill during his time in the Navy: "GI Jill ... did so much to bolster our morale. She came across like a wholesome girl-next-door who began each radio show with 'Hi-ya, fellas! This is GI Jill with the ''GI Jive''.' ... We all loved her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stearman|first1=William|title=An American Adventure: From Early Aviation through Three Wars to the White House|date=2013|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=9781612514031|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C0m_qUSmcZkC&amp;pg=RA1-PA5&amp;dq=%22GI+Jill%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiphq3ehv7WAhUBQiYKHSRvBKsQ6AEIQDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22GI%20Jill%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jill's rapport with listeners went beyond the 15 minutes of each broadcast. As servicemen wrote letters asking her to play certain records, she tried to reply to each letter she received,&lt;ref name=dafrs/&gt; answering as many as 500 letters per week,&lt;ref name="scs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Civilians Hear GI Jill|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14626463/gi_jill/|work=Santa Cruz Sentinel|agency=United Press|date=December 24, 1945|location=California, Santa Cruz|page=2|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = October 23, 2017}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a photograph of herself with her letter.&lt;ref name=dafrs&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mackenzie|first1=Harry|title=The Directory of the Armed Forces Radio Service Series|date=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313308123|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L3WyZ9A4_XEC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22GI+Jill%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiphq3ehv7WAhUBQiYKHSRvBKsQ6AEIXjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22GI%20Jill%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interaction went both ways as some listeners sent Jill pictures of themselves, leading her to comment, "I think I was the only person in the world who had pinup boys."&lt;ref name="ig" /&gt; Some even sent her hand-made trinkets like a bracelet fashioned from a crashed airplane's broken window and a crudely inscribed heart-shaped pendant saying, "To Jill from Lou, 1944".&lt;ref name="ig" /&gt; Most of the letters and photographs that she received were destroyed when her family's house in Hollywood burned.&lt;ref name="ig" /&gt;

Jill's success led to a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] program of sorts when Virginia C. Claudon Allen was trained to broadcast in India to counteract broadcasts of Radio Tokyo. Allen "was sometimes referred to as the GI Jill of India."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shope|first1=Bradley|title=American Popular Music in Britain's Raj|date=2016|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=9781580465489|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hk9-CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=%22GI+Jill%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiphq3ehv7WAhUBQiYKHSRvBKsQ6AEIUjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22GI%20Jill%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Jill eventually began a second program, AEF Jukebox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Bookshelf/IDX/MNO/On-The-Short-Waves-OCR-Page-0222.pdf|title=On the Short Waves, 1923-1945|last1=Berg|first1=Jerome S.|date=1999|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.|isbn=978-0-7864-3029-1|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|page=212|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Jill married Mort Werner on March 18, 1939. At that time, she worked at radio station [[KLAC|KMTR]] in Los Angeles, California, and he was program director there. They have two daughters.&lt;ref name="bc"&gt;{{cite news|title=A thorough `education' in client, agency and network fields|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/63-OCR/1963-10-14-BC-OCR-Page-0105.pdf|accessdate=26 October 2017|work=Broadcasting|date=October 14, 1963|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genre''' ({{ety|fr|genre|kind, sort}}) is any form or type of [[communication]] in any mode (written, spoken, digital, artistic, etc.) with socially-agreed upon conventions developed over time. Genre is most popularly known as a [[Category of being|category]] of [[literature]], [[music]], or other forms of art or entertainment, whether written or spoken, audio or visual, based on some set of stylistic criteria, yet genres can be aesthetic, rhetorical, communicative, or functional. Genres form by conventions that change over time as cultures invent new genres and discontinue the use of old ones. Often, works fit into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions. Stand-alone texts, works, or pieces of communication may have individual styles, but genres are amalgams of these texts based on agreed-upon or socially inferred conventions. Some genres may have rigid, strictly adhered-to guidelines, while others may show great flexibility.

Genre began as an absolute classification system for [[ancient Greek literature]].{{cn|date=March 2018}} [[Poetry]] ([[ode]]s,  [[Epic poetry|epics]], etc.), [[prose]], and [[performance]] each had a specific and calculated style that related to the theme of the story. Speech patterns for comedy would not be appropriate for tragedy, and even actors were restricted to their genre under the assumption that a type of person could tell one type of story best.

In later periods{{when?|date=March 2018}} genres proliferated and developed in response to changes in audiences and creators.  Genre became a dynamic tool to help the public make sense out of unpredictable art. Because art is often a response to a social state, in that people write/paint/sing/dance about what they know about, the use of genre as a tool must be able to adapt to changing meanings.

Genre suffers from the ills of any classification system. It has been suggested{{by whom?|date=March 2018}} that genres resonate with people because of the familiarity, the shorthand communication, as well as because of the tendency of genres to shift with public [[mores]] and to reflect the [[zeitgeist]]. While the genre of [[storytelling]] has been relegated{{by whom?|date=March 2018}} as lesser form of art because of the heavily borrowed nature of the [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], admiration has grown. Proponents{{who?|date=March 2018}} argue that the genius of an effective genre piece is in the variation, recombination, and evolution of the codes.

==Visual arts==
[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 014.jpg|thumb|A genre painting (''Peasant Dance'', c. 1568, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]] the Elder) ]]

The term ''genre'' is much used in the history and criticism of visual art, but in [[art history]] has meanings that overlap rather confusingly. [[Genre painting]] is a term for paintings where the main subject features human figures to whom no specific identity attaches{{spaced ndash}}in other words, figures are not portraits, characters from a story, or allegorical personifications. These are distinguished from [[staffage]]: incidental figures in what is primarily a [[landscape art|landscape]] or architectural painting. ''Genre painting'' may also be used as a wider term covering genre painting proper, and other specialized types of paintings such as [[still-life]], landscapes, [[marine painting]]s and animal paintings.

The concept of the "[[hierarchy of genres]]" was a powerful one in artistic theory, especially between the 17th and 19th centuries.  It was strongest in France, where it was associated with the [[Académie française]] which held a central role in [[academic art]]. The genres in hierarchical order are:
* [[History painting]], including narrative religious mythological and allegorical subjects
* [[Portrait painting]]
* Genre painting or scenes of everyday life
* Landscape (landscapists were the "common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art" according to the Dutch theorist [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]]) and cityscape
* [[Animal painter|Animal painting]]
* [[Still life]]

==Literature==
{{Literature}}
{{Main article|Literary genre|List of literary genres}}
A literary genre is a category of literary composition. Genres may be determined by [[literary technique]], [[setting tone|tone]], [[Content (media)|content]], or even (as in the case of fiction) length. Genre should not be confused with age category, by which literature may be classified as either adult, [[young adult fiction|young adult]], or [[children's literature|children's]].  They also must not be confused with format, such as [[graphic novel]] or picture book. The distinctions between genres and categories are flexible and loosely defined, often with subgroups.

The most general genres in literature are (in loose chronological order) [[epic poetry|epic]], [[tragedy]],&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 1983, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[comedy]], [[novel]], and [[short story]]. They can all be in the genres [[prose]] or [[poetry]], which shows best how loosely genres are defined. Additionally, a genre such as [[satire]] might appear in any of the above, not only as a subgenre but as a mixture of genres. Finally, they are defined by the general [[cultural movement]] of the [[historical period]] in which they were composed.  In [[popular fiction]], which is especially divided by genres, [[genre fiction]] is the more usual term.

In [[literature]], genre has been known as an intangible [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]].  This taxonomy implies a concept of containment or that an idea will be stable forever.The earliest recorded systems of genre in [[Western world|Western history]] can be traced back to Plato and Aristotle. Gérard Genette, a French literary theorist and author of ''The Architext'', describes Plato as creating three Imitational genres: dramatic dialogue, pure narrative, and [[Epic (genre)|epic]] (a mixture of dialogue and narrative). [[Lyric poetry]], the fourth and final type of [[Greek literature]], was excluded by Plato as a non-mimetic mode. Aristotle later revised Plato's system by eliminating the pure narrative as a viable mode and distinguishing by two additional criteria: the object to be imitated, as objects could be either superior or inferior, and the medium of presentation such as words, gestures or verse.  Essentially, the three categories of mode, object, and medium can be visualized along an XYZ axis.

Excluding the criteria of medium, Aristotle's system distinguished four types of classical genres: [[tragedy]] (superior-dramatic dialogue), [[epic poetry|epic]] (superior-mixed narrative), [[comedy]] (inferior-dramatic dialogue), and [[parody]] (inferior-mixed narrative). Genette continues by explaining the later integration of lyric poetry into the classical system during the [[Romanticism|romantic period]], replacing the now removed pure narrative mode. Lyric poetry, once considered non-mimetic, was deemed to imitate feelings, becoming the third leg of a new tripartite system: lyrical, epical, and dramatic dialogue. This system, which came to "dominate all the literary theory of German romanticism (and therefore well beyond)…" (38), has seen numerous attempts at expansion or revision. However, more ambitious efforts to expand the tripartite system resulted in new taxonomic systems of increasing scope and complexity.

Genette reflects upon these various systems, comparing them to the original tripartite arrangement: "its structure is somewhat superior to…those that have come after, fundamentally flawed as they are by their inclusive and hierarchical taxonomy, which each time immediately brings the whole game to a standstill and produces an impasse" (74). Taxonomy allows for a structured classification system of genre, as opposed to a more contemporary rhetorical model of genre.

==Film==
{{main article|Film genre}}
The basic genres of film can be regarded as drama, in the [[feature film]] and most [[cartoon]]s, and [[documentary]].  Most dramatic feature films, especially from [[Hollywood]] fall fairly comfortably into one of a long list of film genres such as the [[Western film|Western]], [[war film]], [[horror film]], [[romantic comedy|romantic comedy film]], [[musical film|musical]], [[crime film]], and many others. Many of these genres have a number of subgenres, for example by setting or subject, or a distinctive national style, for example in the Indian [[Bollywood]] musical.

==Music==
{{main article|Music genre}}
A '''music genre''' is a conventional category that identifies pieces of [[music]] as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Samson, Jim. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/40599 "Genre"]. In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Accessed March 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It is to be distinguished from ''[[musical form]]'' and ''musical style'', although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} There are numerous genres in Western [[classical music]] and [[popular music]], as well as [[musical theatre]] and the music of non-Western cultures. The term is now perhaps over-used to describe relatively small differences in musical style in modern [[rock music]], that also may reflect sociological differences in their audiences.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Timothy Laurie suggests that in the context of rock and pop music studies, the "appeal of genre criticism is that it makes narratives out of musical worlds that often seem to lack them".&lt;ref name="Laurie 2014"&gt;{{Cite news | title= Music Genre As Method | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | newspaper= Cultural Studies Review | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/9087511}} 20 (2), pp. 283-292.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music can be divided into different genres in several ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often arbitrary and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are several academic approaches to genres. In his book ''Form in Tonal Music'', Douglass M. Green lists [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], [[motet]], [[canzona]], [[ricercar]], and dance as examples of genres from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period. According to Green, "Beethoven's ''Op. 61'' and Mendelssohn's ''Op. 64'' are identical in genre&amp;nbsp;– both are violin concertos&amp;nbsp;– but different in form. However, Mozart's ''Rondo for Piano, K. 511'', and the ''Agnus Dei'' from his ''Mass, K. 317'' are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Form in Tonal Music |last=Green |first=Douglass M. |year=1965 |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, Inc |isbn=0-03-020286-8 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, like [[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|Peter van der Merwe]], treat the terms ''genre'' and ''style'' as the same, saying that ''genre'' should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style or "basic musical language".&lt;ref name=Pete&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins of the Popular Style: The Antecedents of Twentieth-Century Popular Music |last=van der Merwe |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter van der Merwe (musicologist) |year=1989 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-316121-4 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as Allan F. Moore, state that ''genre'' and ''style'' are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore, Allan F.
[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3526163 "Categorical Conventions in Music Discourse: Style and Genre"]. ''Music &amp; Letters'', Vol. 82, No. 3 (Aug. 2001), pp. 432–442.&lt;/ref&gt; A music genre or subgenre may be defined by the [[musical technique]]s, the styles, the context, and content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres.

Several music scholars have criticised the priority accorded to genre-based communities and listening practices. For example, Laurie argues that "music genres do not belong to isolated, self-sufficient communities. People constantly move between environments where diverse forms of music are heard, advertised and accessorised with distinctive iconographies, narratives and celebrity identities that also touch on non-musical worlds."&lt;ref name="Laurie 2014"/&gt;

==Popular culture and other media==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
The concept of genre is often applied, sometimes rather loosely, to other media with an artistic element, such as [[video game genres]]. Genre, and numerous minutely divided subgenres, affect popular culture very significantly, not least as they are used to classify it for publicity purposes.  The vastly increased output of popular culture in the age of electronic media encourages dividing cultural products by genre to simplify the search for products by consumers, a trend the Internet has only intensified.

==Linguistics==
In [[philosophy of language]], genre figures prominently in the works of philosopher and literary scholar [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]. Bakhtin's basic observations were of "speech genres" (the idea of [[heteroglossia]]), modes of speaking or writing that people learn to mimic, weave together, and manipulate (such as "formal letter" and "grocery list", or "university lecture" and "personal anecdote"). In this sense, genres are socially specified: recognized and defined (often informally) by a particular culture or community. The work of [[Georg Lukács]] also touches on the nature of [[literary genre]]s, appearing separately but around the same time (1920s–1930s) as Bakhtin. [[Norman Fairclough]] has a similar concept of genre that emphasizes the social context of the text: Genres are "different ways of (inter)acting discoursally" (Fairclough, 2003: 26).

A text's genre may be determined by its:

# Linguistic function.
# Formal traits.
# Textual organization.
# Relation of communicative situation to formal and organizational traits of the text (Charaudeau and Maingueneau, 2002:278–280).

==Rhetoric==
In the field of [[rhetoric]], genre theorists usually understand genres as types of actions rather than types or forms of texts.&lt;ref&gt;Bawarshi, A. S., &amp; Mary Jo Reiff. (2010). [http://wac.colostate.edu/books/bawarshi_reiff/ Genre: An Introduction to History, Theory, Research, and Pedagogy.] chs. 5 and 6&lt;/ref&gt; On this perspective, texts are channels through which genres are enacted. Carolyn Miller's&lt;ref&gt;Miller, C. R. (1984). Genre as social action. Quarterly Journal of Speech, 70(2), 151–167.&lt;/ref&gt; work has been especially important for this perspective. Drawing on [[Lloyd Bitzer]]'s concept of rhetorical situation,&lt;ref&gt;Bitzer, L. F. (1968). The Rhetorical Situation. Philosophy and Rhetoric, 1(1), 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller reasons that recurring rhetorical problems tend to elicit recurring responses; drawing on [[Alfred Schütz]],&lt;ref&gt;Schutz, A., &amp; Luckmann, T. (1973). The Structures of the Life-World. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; she reasons that these recurring responses become "typified" – that is, socially constructed as recognizable types. Miller argues that these "typified rhetorical actions" (p.&amp;nbsp;151) are properly understood as genres.

Building off of Miller, [[Charles Bazerman]] and Clay Spinuzzi have argued that genres understood as actions derive their meaning from other genres – that is, other actions. Bazerman therefore proposes that we analyze genres in terms of "genre systems",&lt;ref&gt;Bazerman, C. (1994). Systems of Genre and the Enactment of Social Intentions. In Genre and the New Rhetoric (pp. 79–101). London/Bristol: Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; while Spinuzzi prefers the closely related concept of "genre ecologies".&lt;ref&gt;Spinuzzi, C., &amp; Zachry, M. (2000). Genre Ecologies : An Open-System Approach to Understanding and Constructing Documentation. ACM Journal of Computer Documentation, 24(3), 169–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

This tradition has had implications for the teaching of writing in American colleges and universities. Combining rhetorical genre theory with [[activity theory]], David Russell has proposed that standard English composition courses are ill-suited to teach the genres that students will write in other contexts across the university and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, D. R. (1995). Activity theory and its implications for writing instruction. In J. Petraglia (Ed.), Reconceiving writing, rethinking writing instruction (pp. 51–78). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Wardle contends that standard composition courses do teach genres, but that these are inauthentic "mutt genres" that are often of little use outside of composition courses.&lt;ref&gt;Wardle, E. (2009). "Mutt Genres" and the Goal of FYC: Can we Help Students Write the Genres of the University? College Composition and Communication, 60(4), 765–789.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This concept of genre originated from the classification systems created by [[Plato]]. Plato divided [[literature]] into the three classic genres accepted in [[Ancient Greece]]: [[poetry]], [[drama]], and [[prose]]. [[Poetry]] is further subdivided into [[epic poetry|epic]], [[lyric poetry|lyric]], and [[drama]]. The divisions are recognized as being set by [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]; however, they were not the only ones. Many genre theorists added to these accepted forms of [[poetry]].

===Classical and Romance genre theory===
The earliest recorded systems of genre in Western history can be traced back to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle#Rhetoric and poetics|Aristotle]]. [[Gérard Genette]] explains his interpretation of the history of genre in "The Architext". He described Plato as the creator of three imitational, mimetic genres distinguished by mode of imitation rather than content. These three imitational genres include dramatic dialogue, the [[drama]]; pure narrative, the [[dithyramb]]; and a mixture of the two, the [[Epic (genre)|epic]]. Plato excluded [[lyric poetry]] as a non-mimetic, imitational mode. Genette further discussed how Aristotle revised Plato's system by first eliminating the pure narrative as a viable mode. He then uses two additional criteria to distinguish the system. The first of the criteria is the object to be imitated, whether superior or inferior. The second criterion is the medium of presentation: words, gestures, or verse. Essentially, the three categories of [[mode (literature)|mode]], [[Object (philosophy)|object]], and [[Medium (communication)|medium]] can be visualized along an XYZ axis. Excluding the criteria of medium, Aristotle's system distinguished four types of classical genres: [[tragedy]], [[Epic (genre)|epic]], [[comedy]], and [[parody]].

Genette explained the integration of lyric poetry into the classical system by replacing the removed pure narrative mode. [[Lyric poetry]], once considered non-mimetic, was deemed to imitate feelings, becoming the third "Architext", a term coined by Gennette, of a new long-enduring tripartite system: lyrical; epical, the mixed narrative; and dramatic, the dialogue. This new system that came to "dominate all the literary theory of [[German romanticism]]" (Genette 38) has seen numerous attempts at expansion and revision. Such attempts include [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel's]] triad of subjective form, the lyric; objective form, the dramatic; and subjective-objective form, the epic. However, more ambitious efforts to expand the tripartite system resulted in new taxonomic systems of increasing complexity. Gennette reflected upon these various systems, comparing them to the original tripartite arrangement: "its structure is somewhat superior to most of those that have come after, fundamentally flawed as they are by their inclusive and hierarchical taxonomy, which each time immediately brings the whole game to a standstill and produces an impasse".

==Culture==
Genre is embedded in [[culture]] but may clash with it at times. There are occasions in which a cultural group may not be inclined to keep within the set structures of a genre. Anthony Pare's studied Inuit social workers in "Genre and Identity: Individuals, Institutions and Ideology". In this study, Pare described the conflict between the genre of Inuit social workers' record keeping forms and the cultural values that prohibited them from fully being able to fulfill the expectations of this genre. Amy Devitt further expands on the concept of culture in her 2004 essay, "A Theory of Genre" by adding "culture defines what situations and genres are likely or possible" (Devitt 24).

Genre not only coexists with culture but also defines its very components. Genres abound in daily life and people often work within them unconsciously; people often take for granted their prominence and ever present residence in society. Devitt touches on Miller's idea of situation, but expands on it and adds that the relationship with genre and situation is reciprocal. Individuals may find themselves shaping the rhetorical situations, which in turn affect the rhetorical responses that arise out of the situation. Because the social workers worked closely with different families, they did not want to disclose many of the details that are standard in the genre of record keeping related to this field. Giving out such information would violate close cultural ties with the members of their community.

==Audiences==
Although genres are not always precisely definable, genre considerations are one of the most important factors in determining what a person will see or read. The classification properties of genre can attract or repel potential users depending on the individual's understanding of a genre.

Genre creates an expectation in that expectation is met or not. Many genres have built-in audiences and corresponding publications that support them, such as [[magazine]]s and websites. Inversely, audiences may call out for change in an antecedent genre and create an entirely new genre.

The term may be used in categorizing [[web page]]s, like "news page" and "fan page", with both very different layout, audience, and intention (Rosso, 2008). Some search engines like [[Vivísimo]] try to group found web pages into automated categories in an attempt to show various genres the search hits might fit.

==Subgenre==
A subgenre is a [[Hierarchy|subordinate]] within a genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/subgenre|title=subgenre|publisher=dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/subgenre|title=Subgenre|work=The Free Dictionary|publisher=Farlex}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two stories being the same genre can still sometimes differ in subgenre. For example, if a [[fantasy]] story has darker and more frightening elements of fantasy, it would belong in the subgenre of [[dark fantasy]]; whereas another fantasy story that features [[magic sword]]s and [[Magician (fantasy)|wizards]] would belong to the subgenre of [[sword and sorcery]].

[[Image:Image Germania (painting).jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Germania'', painted in 1848]]
[[Image:Nationalversammlung in der Paulskirche.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Frankfurt Parliament meeting in the [[Paulskirche]] decorated with the painting in 1848/49 (coloured, contemporary engraving). The yellow color on the flag is of contemporary imagination.]]

'''''Germania''''' is a [[painting]] created at the end of March 1848 during the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. This [[allegory|allegorical]] figure is represented with the [[Reichsadler]], oak leaves (symbols of German strength), an [[olive]] branch (as a sign of peace), sometimes alternatively identified as a [[cannabis]] branch, and a banner.

It was hung in the [[Frankfurt Parliament|National Assembly]] in [[Frankfurt]]'s ''[[St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt|Paulskirche]]'', where it concealed the organ. It was meant as a symbol of a united democratic [[Germany]].

After the revolution, the painting belonged to the [[German Confederation]] but was not exhibited any more. After the dissolution of the German Confederation, the ''Bundesliquidationskommission'' gave the painting and other items of the National Assembly to the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]] in [[Nuremberg]], in 1867.

The actual painter is unknown. Traditionally the painting is attributed to [[Philipp Veit]] since c. 1900. Apparently its allegorical language draws from [[Germania (Philipp Veit)|Veit's ''Germania'']] painting from 1834&amp;ndash;1836. According to Rainer Schoch it might be a collaboration of several artists of the artistic circle ''Deutsches Haus''.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Schoch: "''Streit um Germania. Bemerkungen zur 'Germania' aus der Paulskirche''{{-"}}. In: Germanisches Nationalmuseum (ed.): 1848: ''Das Europa der Bilder''. Volume II: ''Michels März''. Nuremberg: Germanisches Nationalmuseum, 1998, pp. 89–102, see p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other symbolism==
; Unfettered Shackle: While [[shackles]] are a symbol of restriction or internment, unfettered shackles are a symbol of freedom, independence, or a new beginning. In national personification, this would indicate past control by another power or nation; either [[Rome]] historically, or more specifically, the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. (''See [[Germany#History|Germany: History]]''). However, this was most likely a symbol of the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte after his Conquest of Europe, of which largely sparked the nationalism that led to the German Revolution of 1848.

; Colors: Note the prominent [[National colours of Germany|black, red and gold]] flag, which is still in use as the [[flag of Germany]].

; Brandished [[Sword]]: In this figure, the sword is brandished and held upright, in a gesture of leadership and defense, rather than offense or attack. Nobility, justice and truth are represented.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3015">'''Hilbert's eighteenth problem''' is one of the 23 [[Hilbert problems]] set out in a celebrated list compiled in 1900 by mathematician [[David Hilbert]].  It asks three separate questions about lattices and sphere packing in Euclidean space.{{sfn|Milnor|1976}}

==Symmetry groups in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; dimensions==
The first part of the problem asks whether there are only finitely many essentially different [[space group]]s in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].  This was answered affirmatively by [[Ludwig Bieberbach|Bieberbach]].

==Anisohedral tiling in 3 dimensions==
The second part of the problem asks whether there exists a [[polyhedron]] which [[tessellation of space|tiles]] 3-dimensional Euclidean space but is not the [[fundamental region]] of any space group; that is, which tiles but does not admit an isohedral (tile-[[group action|transitive]]) tiling.  Such tiles are now known as [[anisohedral tiling|anisohedral]].  In asking the problem in three dimensions, Hilbert was probably assuming that no such tile exists in two dimensions; this assumption later turned out to be incorrect.

The first such tile in three dimensions was found by [[Karl Reinhardt (mathematician)|Karl Reinhardt]] in 1928.  The first example in two dimensions was found by [[Heinrich Heesch|Heesch]] in 1935.{{sfn|Edwards|2003}} The related [[einstein problem]]&lt;!-- Note: do not capitalize einstein. The name of this problem is a pun on "one stone" and Einstein's name. --&gt; asks for a shape that can tile space but not with an [[infinite cyclic group]] of symmetries.

==Sphere packing==
The third part of the problem asks for the densest [[sphere packing]] or packing of other specified shapes.  Although it expressly includes shapes other than spheres, it is generally taken as equivalent to the [[Kepler conjecture]].

In 1998 American mathematician [[Thomas Callister Hales]] gave a [[computer-aided proof]] of the Kepler conjecture. It shows that the most space-efficient way to pack spheres is in a pyramid shape.{{sfn|Hales|2005}}

}}The '''''International Honor Quilt'' ('''also known as the '''''International Quilting Bee'')''' is a collective [[Feminism|feminist]] [[Art|art project]] initiated in 1980 by [[Judy Chicago]] as a companion piece to ''[[The Dinner Party]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2016/01/15/feminist-quilt-displayed-u-l/78848054/|title=Feminist quilt to be displayed at U of L|website=The Courier-Journal|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtontimes.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/27/international-honor-quilt-given-to-u-of-l/|title=‘International Honor Quilt’ given to U of L|last=|first=|website=The Washingtion Times|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The piece is a collection of 539 two-foot-long&amp;nbsp;quilted triangles that honor women from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xG_kD43EDP0C|title=The Dinner Party: Judy Chicago and the Power of Popular Feminism, 1970–2007|last=Gerhard|first=Jane F.|date=2013-06-01|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=9780820336756|page=196|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Flower, Chicago's not-for-profit organization,  gifted the collection to [[University of Louisville]] Hite Art Institute in 2013 to be available for research and to exhibit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==

=== Creation ===
In Judy Chicago's autobiography, ''Beyond the Flower'', she discusses initiating the International Quilting Bee, stating that "people would be invited to submit their triangular quilts. . .honoring women of their own determination. By doing this, I intended to provide an opportunity for community participation and also to counter another criticism that had emerged, this time about my choices of women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Flower: The Autobiography of a Feminist Artist|last=Chicago|first=Judy|publisher=Penguin Group|year=1996|isbn=0-670-85295-3|location=New York|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community collaboration ===
Individual Quilt panels were often created by groups of women after viewing or hearing about Chicago's ''Dinner Party'' . For example, a group from the Chrysallis Center at [[Saginaw Valley State University]], Michigan, visited the Dinner Party exhibition in Chicago in 1981. Returning to Saginaw via bus that evening, they decided they needed to create a quilt panel and submit it to the project.  Under the leadership of Rosalie (Riegle) Troester,  an English instructor at the University, and Trish Nowicke, Campus Minister, a group of fourteen students created a multicolored butterfly wing ([http://digital.library.louisville.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/ihq/id/1178/rec/1 IQB-352]) representing the growth stage it symbolizes as well as the student career counseling and  support center of which they were members. They completed the project and forwarded their creation to Through the Flower for display in the next Dinner Party venue, [[Montreal]].&lt;ref name="washingtontimes.com"/&gt;

[[File:Jedermann Michelides 52.jpeg|thumb|300px|{{Interlanguage link multi|Cornelius Obonya|de}} and [[Peter Lohmeyer]] portraying ''{{Lang|de|Jedermann}}'' and Death at the [[Salzburg Festival]] in 2014]]
'''''{{Lang|de|Jedermann}}''''' (''Everyman'') is a play by the Austrian playwright [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]]. It is based on several medieval [[mystery play]]s, including the late 15th-century English [[morality play]] ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]''. It was first performed on 1 December 1911 in Berlin under the direction of [[Max Reinhardt]] at the Circus Schumann (which later became the [[Großes Schauspielhaus]]).

''{{Lang|de|Jedermann}}'' has been performed annually at the [[Salzburg Festival]] since 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | editor-last = Banham | editor-first = Martin | year = 1998 | title = The Cambridge Guide to Theatre | publisher = Cambridge University Press | page=491.}}&lt;/ref&gt; except between 1922 and 1925 and during the years of the [[Anschluss|Nazi annexation of Austria]] and [[World War II]] from 1938 until 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Martin.

Retrieved November 30, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the play has been performed there every year. Amongst the most famous actors performing the title role were [[Curd Jürgens]], [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]], [[Maximilian Schell]] and [[Gert Voss]].

The play has been made into a film at least eight times, including in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0924230|Jedermann|(1958)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1961,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0133881|Everyman|(1961)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1970,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0417815|Jedermann|(1970)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|3036016|Jedermann|(1983)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0293845|Jedermann|(2000)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0460474|Jedermann|(2004)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|5179122|Jedermann|(2010)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|3035990|Jedermann|(2013)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1961 film ''[[Jedermann (film)|Jedermann]]'', directed by Max Reinhardt's son [[Gottfried Reinhardt]] and filmed at the Salzburg Festival, was submitted as the Austrian entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[34th Academy Awards]], but it was not selected as one of the five nominees in the category.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences {{Full citation needed|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Den danske Vitruvius 1 tab003 - Kiöbenhavns Wartegn.jpg|thumb|200px|Depiction in [[Lauritz de Thurah|Thurah]]'s ''[[Den Danske Vitruvius]]'' ]]
A '''''Leda and the Swan''''' statue, depicting the classical myth of [[Leda and the Swan]], was from 1611 to 1795 a major [[landmark]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. The statue topped a tall column located just off the entrance to the naval [[Christian IV's Arsenal|Arsenal Harbour]].

==History==
The monument was built in 1611 during the reign of King [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]]. [[Lauritz de Thurah]]'s ''[[Den Danske Vitruvius]]'' (1st volume, 1746) incorrectly states that the statue was brought home from [[Kalmar]] as [[war loot]].&lt;ref name=Selskabet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kobenhavnshistorie.dk/bog/kko/h/kko_h-6.html|title=Havfruegrunden|publisher=Selskabet for KØbenhavns Historie|accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument was built on an artificial islet with walled sides, on a shallow-watered [[sandbar]] known as the ''Mermaid Bar'' due to a particularly high frequency of reported [[mermaid]] sightings, just outside the entrance to a new naval harbour, the [[Christian IV's Arsenal|Arsenal Harbour]] which was completed about the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b.dk/kultur/krigshavnen-ved-toejhuset|title=Krigshavnen ved Tøjhuset|publisher=Berlingske|accessdate=2011-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1795, the monument was removed when increasing ship traffic in the harbour made it necessary to dig out the area which, by then, was only one metre deep.&lt;ref name=Selskabet/&gt;

The fate of the statue is uncertain. Some reports state that shortly before 1900 it was to be found on a garden lot at [[Frederiksberg Allé]].&lt;ref name=Selskabet/&gt;

'''Leonid Naumovich Stolovich''' ({{lang-ru|Леони́д Нау́мович Столович}}; {{lang-et|Leonid Stolovitš}}; July 22, 1929, [[Leningrad]] – November 4, 2013, [[Tartu]]) was a [[Russian philosophy|Russian]]–[[Estonia]]n [[philosopher]], Doctor of Philosophy (1966) and professor (1967).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Delfi |url=http://rus.delfi.ee/daily/estonia/skonchalsya-professor-tartuskogo-universiteta-leonid-stolovich.d?id=67042744 |title=Скончался профессор Тартуского университета Леонид Столович - Delfi |publisher=Rus.delfi.ee |date= |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stolovich graduated from the [[Leningrad University]] in 1952, from 1953 on he worked at [[Tartu University]], [[Estonia]], from 1994 on as a [[professor emeritus]].
Above all, Stolovich studied [[esthetics]]: its history, theories of esthetics and [[axiology]]. He is the author of more than forty books and 400 publications in 20 languages. 

During the ''[[Perestroika]]'' era, Stolovich took part in the pro-democracy movement ([[Popular Front of Estonia]]). Stolovich’s work “Pluralism in the Philosophy…” decovers 'systematic pluralism', a term coined by Stolovich, which means the unity of dialectical opposites pluralism and monism.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Little House on the Prairie'' books}}
The original '''Little House books''' were a series of eight autobiographical children's novels written by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]] and published by [[Harper &amp; Brothers]] from 1932 to 1943. The eighth book, ''[[These Happy Golden Years]]'', featured Laura Ingalls at ages 15 to 18 and was originally published with one page at the end containing the note, "The end of the Little House books."&lt;ref&gt;[http://lccn.loc.gov/43051065] {{dead link|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ninth and last novel written by Wilder, ''The First Four Years'' was published posthumously and unfinished in 1971. Although her intentions are unknown&lt;!--we say in the book article--&gt;, it is commonly considered part of the [[Little House series]] and is included in the 9-volume paperback box set ''Little House, Big Adventure'' (Harper Trophy, May 1994).&lt;ref name=9set1994/&gt;

Several book series and some single novels by other writers have been published for children, young adults and adult readers. They provide fictionalized accounts of the lives of Wilder's great-grandmother [[Martha Morse Tucker]], grandmother [[Charlotte Tucker Quiner]], mother [[Caroline Ingalls]], and daughter [[Rose Wilder Lane]]'s childhood and teenage years, as well as Wilder's own missing years—those portions of her life not featured in her novels, including most of her adult life. One story not written by Wilder is ''[[Old Town in the Green Groves]]'' by [[Cynthia Rylant]]. It tells the story of the "lost little house" years.

In addition, simplified versions of the original series have been published for younger children in chapter and picture book form.

Some nonfiction books by Ingalls Wilder, and some by other writers, are sometimes called Little House books or Little House on the Prairie books.

The eight ''Little House'' books published during the author's lifetime are [[public domain]] in countries where the [[List of countries' copyright lengths|term of copyright]] lasts 50 years or less after the death of the author.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==''Little House in the Big Woods''==
{{main|Little House in the Big Woods}}
[[Image:1932-LittleHouseInTheBigWoods.jpg|thumb|left |150px| Front cover of the first edition, 1932 (distributed with a dustjacket)]]
[[File:Little House Wayside replica.jpg|thumb|left|Little House replica at the [[Little House Wayside]], 2007 ]]
The story of the first book in the series, ''Little House in the Big Woods'', revolves around the life of the Ingalls family in their small home near [[Pepin, Wisconsin]]. The family includes mother Caroline Lake Quiner Ingalls, father Charles Phillip Ingalls, eldest daughter [[Mary Ingalls|Mary Amelia Ingalls]], middle daughter (and protagonist) Laura Elizabeth Ingalls Wilder, and youngest sister Carrie.&lt;ref&gt;en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Ingalls&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gormley, ''Laura Ingalls Wilder: Young Pioneer'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Laura turns five years old during the book, the author was actually only three years old during the real-life events documented in the novel.  According to a letter from Wilder's daughter, Rose, to biographer William Anderson, the publisher had Laura change her age in the book because it seemed unrealistic for a three-year-old to have such specific memories.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Laura Ingalls Wilder: The Iowa  Story'' pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the sake of continuity, in Wilder's later book, ''Little House on the Prairie'', Laura portrayed herself as between six and seven years of age.

''Little House in the Big Woods'' describes the homesteading skills Laura observed and began to practice during her fifth year. The cousins come for Christmas that year, and Laura receives a doll, which she names Charlotte. Later that winter, the family goes to Grandma Ingalls’s and has a “sugaring off”. The family and neighbors harvest sap and make [[maple syrup]]. The Ingalls family returns home with buckets of syrup, enough to last the year. Laura remembered that sugaring off, and the dance that followed, for the rest of her life.

The book also describes other farm work duties and events, such as the birth of a calf, and the availability of [[milk]], [[butter]] and [[cheese]], gardening, field work, and hunting and gathering. Everyday housework is described in detail. When Pa goes into the woods to hunt, he usually comes home with a deer and smokes the meat for the coming winter. One day he notices a bee tree and returns from hunting early to get the wash tub and milk pail to collect the [[honey]]. When Pa returns in the winter evenings, Laura and Mary beg him to play his [[fiddle]], as he is too tired from farm work to play during the summertime.

== ''Farmer Boy'' ==
{{main|Farmer Boy}}
''Farmer Boy'', published in 1933, is the second of the Little House series.  It is the sole book that does not focus on the childhood of Laura Ingalls.  It is focused on the childhood of Laura's future husband, [[Almanzo Wilder]], growing up on a farm in upstate New York in the 1860s.  It takes place before Laura was born.

The book begins just before Wilder's ninth birthday and follows at least two harvest cycles. Set around 1866, it describes in detail the endless chores involved in running the Wilder family farm and Almanzo's part in it.  The novel includes stories of Almanzo's brother Royal and his sisters Eliza Jane and Alice. 

Notably, the ages of the Wilder children do not appear to be accurate to their real ages in comparison to Almanzo. Royal is stated to be thirteen, and Eliza Jane and Alice twelve and ten respectively, at the time when Almanzo is just prior to nine years old. In reality, when Almanzo turned nine, Royal would have been nineteen, old enough to leave home, and Eliza Jane and Alice would have been sixteen and twelve years old. This makes it likely that parts of the storyline based around the three older children was fabricated, at least in terms of what Almanzo himself could remember.

Almanzo had a third sister, Laura (1844–1899), who at the time and events in the novel was already about twenty-two and had presumably moved out. He later had a brother, Perley (1869–1934), who was not yet born at the time ''Farmer Boy'' is set.

==''Little House on the Prairie''==
{{main|Little House on the Prairie (novel)}}
''Little House on the Prairie'', published in 1935, is the third of the series of books known as the Little House series, but only the second book to focus on the life of the Ingalls family. The book takes place from 1873–1874.

The book tells about the months the Ingalls family spent on the prairie of Kansas, around the town of [[Independence, Kansas]]. At the beginning of this story, [[Charles Ingalls|Pa Ingalls]] decides to sell the house in the Big Woods of [[Wisconsin]], and move the family, via [[covered wagon]] to the [[Indian Territory]] near Independence, Kansas, as there were widely circulating stories that the land (technically still under [[Osage Nation|Osage]] ownership) would be opened to settlement by homesteaders. Laura, along with Pa and [[Caroline Ingalls|Ma]], [[Mary Ingalls|Mary]], and baby [[Carrie Ingalls|Carrie]], moves to [[Kansas]]. Along the way, Pa trades his two horses for two Western [[Mustang (horse)|mustangs]], which Laura and Mary name Pet and Patty.

[[Image:Caroline&amp;CharlesIngalls.jpg|thumb|right| Caroline and Charles Ingalls]]

When the family reaches Indian Territory, they meet Mr. Edwards, who is extremely polite to Ma, but tells Laura and Mary that he is "a wildcat from [[Tennessee]]." Mr. Edwards is an excellent neighbor, and helps the Ingalls family in every way he can, beginning with helping Pa build their house. Pa builds a roof and a floor for the house and digs a well with assistance from another neighour, Mr. Scott, and the family is finally settled.

Unlike during their time in the Big Woods, the family meets difficulty and danger on the prairie. The Ingalls become terribly ill with "[[malaria|fever 'n' ague]]" (fever with severe chills and shaking) which was later identified as [[malaria]]. Laura comments on the varied ways they believe to have acquired it, with "Ma" asserting that it came from eating bad watermelon. Dr.Tan, an African American doctor, takes care of the family while they are sick. Around this time,  Mr. Edwards brings Laura and Mary their Christmas presents from Independence, and in the spring, the Ingallses plant the beginnings of a small farm.

Ma's prejudice against American Indians, and Laura's childish feelings, are shown side by side with the portrayal of the Osage tribe that lives on and owns the Ingalls's land. A recurring feature of the book is Laura's desire to see a Native American baby, referred to as a [[papoose]] by the family, culminating with Laura demanding that Pa kidnap a baby from the Osage tribe as they leave, shocking both Ma and Pa and encouraging an emotional reality hit for Laura. At the end of this book, the family is told that the land must be vacated by settlers as it is not legally open to settlement yet, and in 1874 Pa elects to leave the land and move before the Army forcibly requires him to abandon the land.

Many of the incidents in the book are actual situations that happened to the Ingalls family. In fact the actual years the events took place were in 1869 to 1870, So Laura was actually two to three years old while the Ingalls lived in Indian Territory during 1869–1870, and she did not remember the incidents herself, she did more historical research on this novel than on any other novel she wrote in an attempt to have all details as accurate as possible.

==''On the Banks of Plum Creek''==
{{main|On the Banks of Plum Creek}}
The fourth book in the series, ''On the Banks of Plum Creek'', takes place from 1871 to 1874, and follows the Ingalls family as they move from Kansas to an area near [[Walnut Grove, Minnesota]], and settle in a dugout "on the banks of [[Plum Creek (Redwood County, Minnesota)]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hoover.archives.gov/LIW/timeline/timeline.html |title=The Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum |publisher=Hoover.archives.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025222424/http://www.hoover.archives.gov/LIW/timeline/timeline.html |archive-date=2014-10-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jack, the family bulldog, moves with the family to Plum Creek, though in real life he did not make the journey. Laura's age is still not accurately portrayed in relation to actual events. During the course of the story, Laura is between the ages of seven and nine years old, but in 1871 her real age would have been four or five.

Pa trades his horses Pet and Patty to the property owner (a man named Hanson) for the land and crops, but later gets two new horses as Christmas presents for the family, which Laura and her sister [[Mary Ingalls|Mary]] name "Sam" and "David". Pa soon builds an above-ground, wooden house for the family. Laura and Mary go to school for the first time at Barry Corner School, where they meet their teacher, Miss Eva Beadle, and befriend Christy and Cassie Kennedy. They also meet [[Nellie Oleson]], who makes fun of Laura and Mary for being "country girls." They begin attending the town church on Sundays, with services given by the widely-loved Reverend Alden, and Laura and Mary go to Sunday School with their new friends. Laura plays with her bulldog Jack when she is home, and she and Mary are invited to a party at the Olesons' home. Laura and Mary invite all the girls (including Nellie) to a party at their house to reciprocate. The family soon goes through hard times when a plague of [[Rocky Mountain Locust]], or grasshoppers, devastates their crops.  For the family to survive, Pa has to go east alone to get a job to make money to get them through the year.  The whole family is very excited when he returns from this job.  The book ends with Pa returning safely to the house after being unaccounted for during a severe four-day [[blizzard]].

==''By the Shores of Silver Lake''==
{{main|By the Shores of Silver Lake}}
The fifth book in the series, ''By the Shores of Silver Lake'' is based on Laura's late childhood spent near [[De Smet, South Dakota]], beginning in 1879. The book also introduces Laura's youngest sister [[Grace Ingalls|Grace]].

The story begins when the family is about to leave Plum Creek, shortly after the family has recovered from the [[Scarlet fever|scarlet fever]] which caused Mary to become blind. The family welcomes a visit from Aunt Docia, whom they had not seen for several years. She suggests that Pa and Ma move west to the rapidly developing Dakota Territory, where Pa could work in Uncle Henry’s railroad camp. Ma and Pa agree, since it will allow Pa to look for a homestead while he works. The family has endured many hardships on Plum Creek and Pa especially is anxious for a new start. After selling his land and farm to neighbors, Pa goes ahead with the wagon and team. Mary is still too weak to travel so the rest of the family follows later by train.

The day Pa leaves, however, their beloved bulldog Jack is found dead, which saddens Laura greatly. In actuality, the dog upon whom Jack was based was no longer with the family at this point, but the author inserted his death here to serve as a transition between her childhood and her adolescence. Laura also begins to play a more mature role in the family due to Mary's blindness—Pa instructs Laura to "be Mary's eyes" and to assist her in daily life as she learns to cope with her disability. Mary is strong and willing to learn.

The family travels to Dakota Territory by train—this is the children's first train trip and they are excited by the novelty of this new mode of transportation that allows them to travel in one hour the distance it would take a horse and wagon an entire day to cover. When the family reunites at the railroad camp, Laura meets her cousin Lena and the two become good friends.

As winter approaches and the railroad workers head back East, the Ingallses wonder where they might stay for the winter. As luck would have it, the county surveyor needs a house-sitter while he is East for the winter, and Pa signs up. It is a winter of luxury for the Ingalls family as they are given all the provisions they need in the large, comfortable house. They spend a cozy winter with their new friends, Mr. and Mrs. Boast, and both families look forward to starting their new claims in the spring.

The "Spring Rush" comes early. The large mobilization of pioneers to the Dakotas in early March prompts Pa to leave immediately on the few days' trip to the claims office. The girls are left alone and spend their days and nights boarding and feeding all the pioneers passing through. They charge 25 cents for dinner and boarding, starting a savings account toward sending Mary to the School for the Blind in Vinton, Iowa, which Mary begins to attend later in the series.

With the aid of his old friend Mr. Edwards, Pa successfully files his claim. As the spring flowers bloom and the prairie comes alive with new settlers, the Ingalls family moves to their new piece of land and begins building what will become their permanent home.

==''The Long Winter''==
{{main|The Long Winter (novel)}}
The sixth book in the series take place mostly over the winter of 1880–1881, one of the most notably severe winters in history, also known as "The Snow Winter".&lt;ref&gt;Laskin, David. ''The Children's Blizzard''. New York: HarperCollins, 2004. pp. 56–57; Potter, Constance [https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2003/winter/little-town-in-nara-2.html "Genealogy Notes: De Smet, Dakota Territory, Little Town in the National Archives", Part 2].

[http://files.usgwarchives.net/sd/history/robinson/liii.txt Chapter III]. pp. 306-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Long Winter (novel)|The Long Winter]] begins in Dakota Territory at the Ingalls homestead on a hot August day in 1880. Laura's father, Pa, is haying. Pa tells Laura that he knows the winter is going to be hard because muskrats always build a house with thick walls before a hard winter, and this year, they have built the thickest walls he has ever seen. In mid-October, the Ingalls wake with an unusually early blizzard howling around their poorly insulated claim shanty. Soon afterward, Pa receives another warning from an unexpected source: a dignified old Native American man comes to the general store in town to warn the white settlers that there will be seven months of blizzards. Pa decides to move the family into town for the winter.

Laura attends school with her younger sister, Carrie, until the weather becomes too severe to permit them to walk to and from the school building. Blizzard after blizzard sweeps through the town over the next few months. The frequent blizzards prevent supply trains from getting to De Smet and food and fuel become scarce and expensive. Eventually, the railroad company suspends all efforts to dig out the trains, leaving the town stranded. For weeks, the Ingalls subsist on potatoes and coarse brown bread, using twisted hay for fuel. As even this meager food runs out, Laura's future husband Almanzo Wilder and his friend Cap Garland risk their lives to bring wheat to the starving townspeople – enough to last the rest of the winter.

As predicted, the blizzards continue for seven months. Finally, the trains begin running again, bringing the Ingalls a Christmas barrel full of good things – including a turkey. In the last chapter, they sit down to enjoy their Christmas dinner in May.

The book is notable as being the first in which Laura's age is historically accurate (in 1880 she would have been 13, as she states in the first chapter). However, Almanzo Wilder's age is misrepresented.  Much is made of the fact that he is 19 pretending to be 21 in order to obtain a homestead claim from the US government. In reality, WIlder was ten years older than Laura. In 1880, his true age would have been 23.  Scholar Ann Romines has suggested that Laura made Almanzo younger because it was felt that more modern audiences would be scandalized by the great difference in their ages in light of their young marriage.

==''Little Town on the Prairie''==
{{main|Little Town on the Prairie}}
The seventh book begins in 1881, just after the long winter, and is largely set in the town of De Smet, South Dakota.

The story begins as Laura accepts her first job performing sewing work in order to earn money for Mary to go to a college for the blind in Iowa. Laura's hard work comes to an end when she is let go, and the family begins planning to raise cash crops to pay for Mary's college. After the crops are destroyed by blackbirds, Pa sells a calf to earn the balance of the money needed. While Ma and Pa escort Mary to the college, Laura, Carrie, and Grace are left alone for a week. In order to stave off the loneliness stemming from Mary's departure, Laura, Carrie, and Grace do the fall cleaning. They have several problems, but the house is sparkling when they are done. Ma and Pa come home and are truly surprised.

In the fall, the Ingalls prepare for a move to town for the winter. Laura and Carrie attend school in town and Laura is reunited with her friends Minnie Johnson and Mary Power. She also meets a new girl, Ida Brown, who has been adopted by the town's minister and his wife. There is a new schoolteacher for the winter term: Eliza Jane Wilder, Almanzo’s sister. [[Nellie Oleson]], Laura's nemesis from Plum Creek, has moved to De Smet and is attending the school. Nellie turns the teacher against Laura and Miss Wilder loses control of the school for a time. This is because to begin with, Miss Wilder is not very strict and wants to be friends with all the children.  Therefore, the children realize that they can get away with acting up most of the time. When Miss Wilder realizes she no longer has control, she begins to use steadily crueler and unneeded punishments, including humiliating Carrie in front of the entire school and striking her hands. A visit by the school board restores order; however, Miss Wilder leaves at the end of the fall term, and is eventually replaced by Mr. Clewett and then Mr. Owen, the latter of whom befriends Laura. Through the course of the winter, Laura sets herself to studying, as she only has one year left before she can apply for a teaching certificate.

Throughout this book, Laura's struggles with order and commitment are highlighted; her grades in school are no longer perfect, and she finds less pleasure in her unchanging life, growing restless and agitated. She focuses her goals on keeping Mary in college, but seems unsure about what she wants for herself. This comes to a head when she throws down her schoolbooks in a tantrum, declaring that she wants something to change and she is tired of having to act like an adult. Later that night, Pa reveals that the elders of the town are founding a literary society; far from what the name suggests, it is a weekly source of entertainment for the townsfolk, ranging from spelling competitions to a [[minstrel show]]. The literary meetings become Laura's primary reason for endurance, and with something to look forward to she is happy to study again.  

At around the same time as the literary meeitngs, Almanzo Wilder begins escorting Laura home from church. By Christmastime, Almanzo once again sees Laura home, and offers to take her on a sleigh ride after he completes the cutter he is building.

At home, Laura is met by Mr. Boast and Mr. Brewster, who interview Laura for a teaching position at a settlement led by Brewster twelve miles (19&amp;nbsp;km) from town. The school superintendent comes and tests Laura (though she is two months too young, he never asks her age), and she is awarded a third-grade teaching certificate.

==''These Happy Golden Years''==
{{main|These Happy Golden Years}}
The eighth book in the series, ''[[These Happy Golden Years]]'' takes place between 1882 and 1885. As the story begins, [[Charles Ingalls|Pa]] is taking Laura 12 miles from home to her first teaching assignment at Brewster settlement. Laura, only 15 and a schoolgirl herself, is apprehensive as this is both the first time she has left home and the first school she has taught. She is determined to complete her assignment and earn $40 to help her sister [[Mary Ingalls|Mary]], who is attending Vinton College for the Blind in Iowa.

This first teaching job proves difficult for her. Laura must board with the Brewsters in their two-room claim shanty, sleeping on their sofa. The Brewsters are an unhappy family and Laura is deeply uncomfortable observing the way husband and wife quarrel. In one particularly unsettling incident, she wakes in the night to see Mrs Brewster standing over her husband with a knife. It is a bitterly cold winter, and neither the claim shanty or the school house can be heated adequately. The children she is teaching, some of whom are older than she is herself, test her skills as a teacher. Laura grows more self-assured through her time there, and successfully completes the two-month assignment, with all five of her pupils sorry to see her go.

To Laura's surprise and delight, homesteader [[Almanzo Wilder]] (with whom she became acquainted in ''[[Little Town on the Prairie]]'') appears at the end of her first week of school in his new two-horse cutter to bring her home for the weekend. Already fond of Laura and wanting to ease her homesickness, Almanzo takes it upon himself to bring her home and back to school each weekend.

The relationship continues after the school term ends. Sleigh rides give way to buggy rides in the spring, and Laura impresses Almanzo with her willingness to help break his new and often temperamental horses, Barnum and Skip. Laura's old nemesis, [[Nellie Oleson]], makes a brief appearance during two Sunday buggy rides with Almanzo. Nellie's chatter and flirtatious behavior towards Almanzo annoy Laura. Shortly thereafter, Nellie moves back to New York after her family loses their homestead.

Laura's Uncle Tom (Ma's brother) visits the family and tells of his failed venture with a covered wagon brigade seeking gold in the Black Hills. Laura helps out seamstress Mrs. McKee by staying with her and her daughter, Mattie, on their prairie claim for two months to "hold it down" as required by law. The family enjoys summer visits from Mary.

The Ingalls family finances have improved to the point that Pa can sell a cow to purchase a sewing machine for [[Caroline Ingalls|Ma]]. Laura continues to teach and work as a seamstress, and Almanzo invites Laura to attend a new "singing school" with him and her classmates. On the last evening of singing school, while driving Laura home, Almanzo – who has by now been courting Laura for three years – proposes to Laura. During their next ride, Almanzo presents Laura with a garnet-and-pearl ring and they share their first kiss.

Several months later, after Almanzo has finished building a house on his tree claim, he asks Laura if she would mind getting married within a few days as his sister and mother have their hearts set on a large church wedding, which Pa cannot afford. Laura agrees, and she and Almanzo are married in a simple ceremony by the Reverend Brown. After a wedding dinner with her family, Laura drives away with Almanzo and the newlyweds settle contentedly into their new home.

==''The First Four Years''==
{{main|The First Four Years (novel)}}
The ninth book in the series, ''[[The First Four Years (novel)]]'', and the final book to feature Laura as the protagonist, follows the earliest years of Laura and Almanzo's marriage. Found after Wilder's death, the book was published in its original draft form in 1971.

The First Four Years derives its title from a promise Laura made to Almanzo when they became engaged. Laura did not want to be a farm wife, but she consented to try farming for three years. At the end of that time, Laura and Almanzo mutually agreed to continue for one more year, a "year of grace". Over the course of the novel, which is set near [[De Smet, South Dakota]], Laura and Almanzo's daughter, [[Rose Wilder Lane|Rose]], is born, they lose their unnamed son shortly after his birth, suffer a bout of [[diphtheria]] that leaves Almanzo in poor health for the rest of his life, and lose their house in a fire. The book ends at the close of that fourth year, on a rather optimistic note. In reality, a two-year drought and several other tragic events eventually drove the Wilders into debt and from their land. They later founded a successful fruit and dairy farm in Mansfield, Missouri, where they lived comfortably until their respective deaths.

''Little House: The Laura Years'' is also the title of one 5-volume boxed set published in 1994, which comprises volumes 1 and 3–6.&lt;ref name=5set1994&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Little-House-Laura-Years-Boxed/dp/0064404765#reader_0064404765 |title=Little House the Laura Years Boxed Set: The Early Years Collection: Laura Ingalls Wilder, Garth Williams: 9780064404761: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it features the Ingalls family until Laura is 14 years old. The second-published Little House book, ''Farmer Boy'' features [[Almanzo Wilder]] at ages 8 to 10 in upstate New York. None of the Ingalls family appears in it, and Almanzo Wilder does not otherwise appear in the series until late in the sixth book, so "The Laura Years" has some merit as title or subtitle of this 5-volume selection. The box cover displays headings "The Early Years Collection: A Special Collection of the First Five Little House Books".&lt;ref name=5set1994/&gt; Only months later, all 9 novels were issued as a boxed set, ''Little House Big Adventure'' (Harper, May 1994), with numerals 1 to 9 on the spine—in the sequence published, and listed here; that is, with ''Farmer Boy'' numbered 2.&lt;ref name=9set1994&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Little-House-Nine-Book-Set/dp/0064400409/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323288832&amp;sr=8-2 |title=Little House Big Adventure (9 Volumes): Laura Ingalls Wilder: 0046594062994: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|List of dance personalities}}

An annotated '''list of popular/famous dancers'''.

{{compact ToC|num=yes}}

== A ==

*[[Fifi Abdou]] (born {{Birth date|1953|04|26|df=yes}}), Egyptian [[belly dancer]] and actress. She rose to fame in the 1970s, and was one of the most famous and successful Egyptian dance stars throughout the 1980s and 1990s until her retirement in the 2000s. She has been the subject of several controversies during her long career.
*[[Paula Abdul]] (born {{Birth date|1962|06|16|df=yes}}), American recording artist, dancer, choreographer, and actress. Before achieving widespread fame as a recording artist in the early 1990s, Abdul, a former high school [[cheerleader]], was a heavily sought-after choreographer who has designed dance routines for several well-known performers, including singer [[Janet Jackson]]. In her music videos, Abdul has exhibited skills in a variety of dance styles, including [[hip-hop dance|hip-hop]], [[tap dance|tap]], and [[Freestyle dance|freestyle]]. Abdul's major television breakthrough came in 2002, when she became a judge on the popular reality television talent competition ''[[American Idol]]'', a role in which she remained for seven years. In 2011 Abdul was one of the judges on the American version of ''[[The X Factor (U.S.)|The X Factor]]'', another reality television singing competition.
*[[Fred Astaire]] ({{Birth date|1899|05|10|df=yes}} – {{Death date|1987|06|22|df=yes}}), American film and Broadway stage dancer, choreographer, singer, musician and actor. He was an innovator in dance. He made 31 musical films and was honored with the fifth Greatest Male Star of All Time by the [[American Film Institute]].

==B==
*[[George Balanchine]] ({{Birth date|1904|01|22|df=yes}} – {{Death date|1983|04|30|df=yes}}), Georgian ballet choreographer. He is one of the 20th century's foremost choreographers, and one of the founders of American ballet. His work formed a bridge between classical and modern ballet. Apollo is Balanchine's oldest surviving ballet and his first great public ballet which Balanchine was to become renowned for. It premiered on June 12, 1928 by Les Ballets Russes de Serge Diaghilev at the Théâtre Sarah Bernhart in Paris. Balanchine looked upon Apollo as the turning point of his life, "in its sustained oneness of tone and feeling". The story centers around Apollo, the god of the sun, who is visited by three muses: Terpsichore, muse of dance; Polyhymnia, muse of hymns; and Calliope, muse of poetry. Balanchine created ballet sequences for Ravel's opera ''L'enfant et les sortilèges'' to Colette's libretto with what Ravel described as "Russian dancers", presumably from the Ballets Russes for the 1925 Monte Carlo premiere, although this is not listed as a Ballets Russes production.
*[[Sara Baras]] (born 1971), female [[Flamenco]] Dancer, born in the port of Cadiz. She is internationally famous and regularly tours the world. She has won a number of awards including the Madroño Flamenco of Montellano (Seville) in 1993,and in 1999 and 2001, she received a prize for the Best Female Spanish Dance Performer.
*[[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] (born {{Birth date|1948|01|28|df=yes}}), Soviet-born Russian American dancer, choreographer, and actor, often cited alongside [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] and [[Rudolf Nureyev]] as one of the greatest ballet dancers of the 20th century. After a promising start in the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad, he defected to Canada in 1974 and went on to become a principal dancer and artistic director with the American Ballet Theatre and the New York City Ballet in New York City. He has spearheaded many of his own artistic projects and has been associated in particular with promoting modern dance, premiering dozens of new works, including many of his own. His success as a dramatic actor on stage, cinema and television has helped him become probably the most widely recognized contemporary dancer.
*[[Bez (dancer)|Bez]] (born {{Birth date|1964|04|18|df=yes}}), renowned as the dancer for the [[Happy Mondays]].
*[[Vytautas Beliajus]] ({{Birth date|1908|02|26|df=yes}} – September 1994), considered the father of [[international folk dancing]] in the United States. He specialized in [[Music of Lithuania|Lithuanian dance]], but performed and taught many other types of dance as well. He published multiple books on the subjects of dance and ethnicity, and also started the folklore magazine Viltis. Beliajus was born in Lithuania and emigrated to the U.S. when he was 14 years old. He had two younger brothers, Leonas and Julius, and a sister, Gyte Jekentes.
*[[Carlo Blasis]] ({{Birth date|1797|11|04|df=yes}} – {{Death date|1878|01|15|df=yes}}), Italian dancer, choreographer and dance theoretician. He is well known for his very rigorous dance classes, sometimes lasting four hours long. He was the first who published an analysis on the ballet techniques in 1820, in a work named ''Traité élémentaire, théorique, et pratique de l'art de la danse'' (''Elementary Treaty on the Art of the Dance, theory and practice''). He is most known for the pose "Attitude" derived from the famous statue Mercury by Giovanni da Bologna. He taught [[Enrico Cecchetti]], who expanded his technique.
*[[Chrystelle Trump Bond]], American dancer, choreographer, and dance historian
*[[James Brown]] or James Joseph Brown, Jr. ({{Birth date|1933|05|03|df=yes}} – {{Death date|2006|12|25|df=yes}}), commonly referred to as "The Godfather of Soul", "Mr. Dynamite", the "King of Funk", "Soul Brother #1" and "The Hardest Working Man in Show Business", was an American entertainer (singer and dancer). He is recognized as one of the most influential figures in 20th-century popular music and was renowned for his vocals and feverish dancing. As a prolific singer, songwriter and bandleader, Brown was a pivotal force in the music industry. He left his mark on numerous artists. Brown's music also left its mark on the rhythms of African popular music, such as afrobeat, jùjú and mbalax, and provided a template for go-go music. Brown began his professional music career in 1953 and rose to fame during the late 1950s and early 1960s on the strength of his thrilling live performances and string of smash hits. During the early 1980s, Brown's music helped to shape the rhythms of early hip-hop music, with numerous groups looping or sampling his funk grooves and turning them into what became hip hop classics and the foundations of the music and dance genre. Brown danced vigorously as he sang, working popular dance steps such as the [[Mashed Potato]] into his routine along with dramatic leaps, splits and slides. In addition, his horn players and backup singers ([[The Famous Flames]]) typically performed choreographed dance routines, and later incarnations of the [[Revue]] included backup dancers. Male performers in the Revue were required to wear tuxedos and cummerbunds long after more casual concert wear became the norm among the younger musical acts. Brown's own extravagant outfits and his elaborate processed hairdo completed the visual impression.
*[[Jean Butler]] (born {{Birth date|1971|03|14|df=yes}}), Irish [[step dancer]].She began training in Irish dance at the age of four with the widely respected teacher Donny Golden. She also participated in tap and ballet classes, but step dance became her focus. Her talent was clear from a young age, and she competed in regional, national and international championships. She and her sister, Cara Butler, both went on to win numerous national titles and regional titles, and placing well in international competitions. Jean has performed with Green Fields of America and Cherish the Ladies. She debuted with The Chieftains at Carnegie Hall at the age of seventeen, and toured with them on three continents.

After an illustrious career as a dancer in Europe, he went to dance for the Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg, Russia where he further honed his skills. By 1888, he was widely accepted as the greatest ballet virtuoso in the world. The general populace was not aware that he could only turn in one direction and in fact, had to have all his choreography tailored especially to accommodate this weakness.
*[[Vernon and Irene Castle]], husband-and-wife team of ballroom dancers of the early 20th century. They are credited with invigorating the popularity of [[modern dancing]].

*[[Benji Schwimmer|Benjiman "Benji" Daniel Schwimmer]] (born on January 18, 1984), American professional [[swing dancer]]. On August 16, 2006 he was crowned "America's Favorite Dancer", as the winner of the second season of ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (U.S. TV series)|So You Think You Can Dance]]''. Benji Schwimmer and his older cousin, Heidi Groskreutz (herself a top-4 finalist on the same season of ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (U.S. TV series)|So You Think You Can Dance]]''), are also U.S. Open Showcase Swing champions in West Coast Swing style. Schwimmer left the dancing scene at the top of his game to serve a two-year mission for the [[LDS Church]] in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. He has subsequently founded the non-profit charity organization "Dancers Everywhere Making a Needed Difference" (D.E.M.A.N.D.) for helping orphans in southern Mexico and Africa and providing healthcare for dancers with HIV/AIDS, and is a co-owner of 5678 Dance Studio in Redlands, California.
*[[Lloyd Shaw (educator)|Lloyd Shaw]] (1890 – 1958), also known as Dr. Lloyd "Pappy" Shaw, was an educator, and is generally credited with bringing about the broad revival of square dancing in America. He was superintendent/principal/teacher/coach for Cheyenne Mountain Schools, Colorado Springs, Colorado from 1916–1951, and taught [[folk dancing]] .Shaw traveled the country, and compiled instructions for traditional square dances from different callers all over the country. He documented them, and tried them out on the students he taught. He formed the Cheyenne Mountain Dancers, a high-school exhibition team, which toured the United States in the 1930s and 1940s, appearing in more than 50 major cities .As the popularity of square dancing grew, square dance callers began extracting individual calls from these dances, and attempts at standardised lists were developed. These lists were later adopted by callers, and organizations such as Callerlab and later the American Callers Association formed to manage and promote a universal list and the type of dance leadership that Shaw envisioned.
*[[Jimmy Slyde]] (born 1927), who is known as the King of Slides, is a world-renowned [[tap dancer]], especially famous for his innovative tap style mixed with [[jazz]]. Slyde's profile in the United States revived noticeably in the 1980s. He danced in the films ''The Cotton Club'', ''Tap'' and ''Round Midnight'', as well as a number of television specials. He collaborated with Steve Condos on a program of jazz tap improvisation at the Smithsonian Institution and performed across the United States and in South America. In 1989, Slyde received a Tony Award nomination for his Broadway debut in the musical Black and Blue. In recent years, Slyde has received a number of significant honors, including the NEA National Heritage Fellowship Award (1999), the Charles "Honi" Coles Award (2001), a Guggenheim Fellowship for Choreography (2003), and an honorary Doctorate of Performing Arts from Oklahoma City University. Slyde is still performing and teaching today throughout the United States. He continues to stress the importance of mastering the basics and using sliding cascades of taps close to the floor.
*"Shorty" [[George Snowden]] was an African American dancer in Harlem during the 1920s and 1930s. He is popularly credited with coining the name "[[Lindy Hop]]" for a popular partner swing dance of the day. He is also often credited with inventing the dance, though this is unsubstantiated and unlikely. Snowden was a popular dancer at the [[Savoy Ballroom]] in Harlem, New York, in the United States and appears in the film After Seben (1929), in which he performs the breakaway, a variation on the Charleston, which later developed into the Lindy Hop. He can also be seen in the film'' Ask Uncle Sol'' (1937), dancing with his most famous partner Big Bea.
*[[Britney Spears]] (born December 2, 1981), American singer and dancer. Apart from being famous for her hit singles "[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]" and "[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!...I Did It Again]]", she is also internationally renowned for her unique outfits and her entertaining and freestyle dancing. Her debut single, "...Baby One More Time", features Spears dancing in a formal yet somewhat revealing catholic school girl uniform, which brought both success and extreme controversy to her iconic career. Britney Spears is often compared to fellow singers and dancers [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Christina Aguilera]].
*[[John W. Bubbles|John William Sublett]] (February 19, 1902 – May 18, 1986), known by his stage name [[John W. Bubbles]], was an American vaudeville performer, singer and entertainer .Sublett is known as the father of "rhythm tap", a form of tap dance. As opposed to the tap dancing of Bill Robinson (Bojangles) who emphasized clean phrases and toe taps, Sublett brought in percussive heel stomps and played with the traditional eight-bar phrase, slowing it down to allow for more rhythmic freedom. He thus merged the art of tap dancing with the new improvisitory style of jazz, reinventing the tap artform.
*[[Sylvia Sykes]], [[swing dance]] instructor, judge and choreographer. In particular she is considered by most to be the leading authority on the dance Balboa. She also represented the U.S. in the World Boogie Woogie Championships in Grenoble, France with her original partner Jonathan Bixby. She is best known for reviving Balboa, which is rapidly gaining popularity around the world, and is a regular guest at the balboa dance camps.
*[[Shantanu Maheshwari]] (born on March 7, 1991), Indian actor, dancer and choreographer.

==T==
*[[Marie Taglioni]] (April 23, 1804 – April 24, 1884), famous Italian ballerina of the [[Romantic ballet]] era, a central figure in the history of European dance. Marie Taglioni was born in Stockholm, Sweden, to the Italian cheoreographer Filippo Taglioni and the Swedish dancer Sophie Karsten (daughter of the Swedish opera singer Christoffer Christian Karsten and the Polish actor Sophie Stebnowska). [[Marie Taglioni]] rose to fame as a dancer when her father (and teacher) created the ballet La Sylphide (1832) for her. Marie retired from performing in 1847. Later she taught social dance to children and society ladies; she also took a limited number of ballet pupils. Her only choreographic work was Le Papillon (1860) for her student Emma Livry, who is remembered for dying in 1863 when her costume was set alight by a gas lamp (limelight) used for stage lighting. Marie lived much longer, dying in Marseilles in 1884.
*[[Layla Taj]], belly dancer whose dances communicate aspects of Egyptian traditions and culture.
*[[Twyla Tharp]] (born July 1, 1941), leading American dancer and choreographer. She has won Emmy and Tony awards, and currently works as a choreographer in New York City .Twyla Tharp Dance merged with American Ballet Theatre in 1988, where Tharp created more than a dozen works. Since that time Tharp has choreographed dances for many companies including The Paris Opera Ballet, The Royal Ballet, New York City Ballet, The Boston Ballet, The Joffrey Ballet, Hubbard Street Dance and The [[Martha Graham]] Dance Company.
*[[Danny Tidwell]] (born August 1, 1984 in Norfolk, Virginia), American contemporary and ballet dancer and choreographer, best known for being the runner-up on Fox's third season of ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (U.S. TV series)|So You Think You Can Dance]]'' in 2007. Tidwell began dancing as a child, at first focusing on [[jazz]] before changing to ballet while attending Kirov Academy of Ballet at the age of fifteen. He has worked in elite companies, including the American Ballet Theater. He has also performed the works of renowned choreographers, including Debbie Allen, William Forsythe and Mia Michaels. He is [[Travis Wall]]'s brother, also a runner-up, of the second season of ''So You Think You Can Dance''.
*[[Eddie Torres]] (born on July 3, 1950), one of the most famous [[Salsa (dance)|salsa dance]] instructors in the world. He has trained thousands of dancers, including some of the most well known contemporary dancers. Through his dance school, he has taught thousands of people how to dance salsa in his own distinctive style. He also has a children's dance program that teaches approximately three hundred students a year.
*[[Antony Tudor]] (4 April 1908 – 19 April 1987), born William Cook, highly influential 20th-century English ballet choreographer, teacher and dancer. Antony Tudor is generally accepted to be one of the great originals of modern dance forms. Along with [[George Balanchine]], he is seen as a principal transformer of ballet into a [[modern art]], but of a genius that uses, rather than proceeds from, ballet forms. His work is usually considered as modern "psychological" expression, but—like their creator–of austerity, elegance and nobility.

== U ==
*[[Uday Shankar]] (December 8, 1900 – September 26, 1977) (Bengali: উদয় শংকর), the pioneer of modern dance in India, and a world renowned Indian dancer and choreographer, was most known for adapting Western theatrical techniques to traditional Indian classical dance, imbued with elements of Indian classical, folk, and tribal dance, thus laying the roots of modern Indian dance, which he later popularized in India, Europe, and the United States in 1920s and 1930s.
*[[Galina Ulanova]] ({{OldStyleDateDY|8 January|1910|26 December 1909}} {{spaced ndash}} 21 March 1998), Russian ballet dancer. She is frequently cited as being one of the greatest [[ballerina]]s of the 20th century. From 1944 to 1960 she was the [[prima ballerina assoluta]] of the [[Bolshoi Theater]].

==V==
*[[Agrippina Yakovlevna Vaganova]] (July 6, 1879 – November 5, 1951), outstanding Russian ballet teacher who developed the [[Vaganova method]] - the technique which derived from the teaching methods of the old Imperial Ballet School (today the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet) under the Premier Maître de Ballet Marius Petipa throughout the mid-to-late 19th century, though mostly throughout the 1880s and 1890s. It was Vaganova who perfected and cultivated this form of teaching the art of classical ballet into a workable syllabus. Her Fundamentals of the Classical Dance (1934) remains a standard textbook for the instruction of ballet technique.

==W==
*[[John Weaver (dancer)|John Weaver]] (July 21, 1673 – September 24, 1760), dancer and choreographer and is commonly known as the father of English [[pantomime]]. Weaver was born in Shrewsbury. His father, a dance teacher, suggested he go to London and become a ballet master. Weaver soon became a specialist in comic roles and created the first pantomime ballet, the burlesque Tavern Bilkers (1702). His more serious work'', The Loves of Mars and Venus'' dealt with themes from classical literature and required a significant amount of gestures due to the story not being expressed in any spoken form. Because Weaver attempted to use plot and emotion in replacement of more sophisticated technical and speech methods, he is considered a major influence on subsequent choreographers, including [[Jean-Georges Noverre]] and [[Gasparo Angiolini]].
*[[Charles Edward Weidman]], Jr. (1901 in Lincoln, Nebraska – 1975), modern dancer, choreographer and teacher. He studied and performed with Denishawn before leaving to form the [[Humphrey-Weidman]] school and company with [[Doris Humphrey]] and Pauline Lawrence. Like his partner Humphrey, Weidman worked from principles of fall and recovery and also experimented with a form of linking unrelated movements that he called "kinetic pantomime." During the 1930s, Weidman taught at the Bennington School of the Dance in Vermont and presented choreography including his popular ''Candide'' (1937) through the Federal Dance Theatre of the WPA.
*[[Mary Wigman]] (1886 – 1973), German dancer, choreographer, and instructor of dance. Credited for innovation of expressionist dance, and pioneer of [[modern dance]] in Germany. Mary Wigman's choreographies often employed non-Western instrumentation: fifes, bells, gongs, and drums from India, Thailand, Africa, and China. However, the primary musical accompaniment for her most well known dances was percussion, which contrasted greatly with her use of silence. Mary would often employ masks in her pieces, influenced again by non-western/tribal motifs, as well as ecstatic spinning.

'''Macramé''' is a form of [[textile]] produced using [[knot]]ting (rather than [[weaving]] or [[knitting]]) techniques.

The primary knots of macramé are the square or [[reef knot]]) and forms of "hitching": various combinations of [[half hitch]]es. It was long crafted by sailors, especially in elaborate or ornamental knotting forms, to cover anything from knife handles to bottles to parts of ships.

Cavandoli macramé is one variety that is used to form geometric and free-form patterns like weaving. The Cavandoli style is done mainly in a single knot, the double half-hitch knot. Reverse half hitches are sometimes used to maintain balance when working left and right halves of a balanced piece.

Leather or fabric belts are another accessory often created via macramé techniques.  Most [[friendship bracelet]]s exchanged among schoolchildren and teens are created using this method. Vendors at theme parks, malls, seasonal fairs and other public places may sell macramé jewellery or decoration as well.

== History ==
[[File:Macrame clove hitch left-2.jpg|thumb]]
Macramé comes from a 13th-century Arabic weavers' word ''migramah'' meaning "fringe".  This refers to the decorative fringes on camels and horses  which help, amongst other things, to keep the flies off the animal in the hot desert regions of northern Africa.

Another school of thought indicates that it comes from Turkish ''makrama'', "napkin" or "towel", and was a way to secure the ends of pieces of weaving by  using the excess thread and yarn along the top and bottom edges of loomed fabrics.

One of the earliest recorded uses of macramé-style knots as decoration appeared in the carvings of the [[Babylon]]ians and [[Assyria]]ns. Fringe-like plaiting and braiding adorned the costumes of the time and were captured in their stone statuary.
Macramé traveled from north Africa to Spain with the [[Moorish conquest|Moors]], and as a result of this conquest it spread, firstly to France, and then  throughout Europe.

In the Western Hemisphere, macramé is believed to have originated with 13th-century [[Arab]] weavers. These artisans knotted the excess thread and yarn along the edges of hand-loomed fabrics into decorative fringes on bath towels, shawls, and veils. The Spanish word ''macramé'' is derived from the Arabic ''miqramah'' ({{lang|ar|مقرمة}}), believed to mean "striped towel", "ornamental fringe" or "embroidered veil". After the Moorish conquest, the art was taken to [[Spain]], then to [[Italy]], especially in the region of [[Liguria]], and then spread through Europe. It was introduced into [[England]] at the court of [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] in the late 17th century. Queen Mary taught the art of macramé to her ladies-in-waiting.[[File:Decorative macramé ship.jpg|thumb]]

Macramé was most popular in the [[Victorian era]]. ''Sylvia's Book of Macramé Lace'' (1882), a favorite, showed readers how "to work rich trimmings for black and coloured costumes, both for home wear, garden parties, seaside ramblings, and balls&amp;mdash;fairylike adornments for household and underlinens ...". Most Victorian homes were adorned by this craft. Macramé was used to make household items such as tablecloths, bedspreads and curtains.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt;

Sailors made macramé objects in off hours while at sea, and sold or bartered them when they landed, thus spreading the art to places like [[China]] and the [[New World]]. Nineteenth-century British and American sailors made [[hammock]]s, [[bell fringe]]s, and [[Belt (clothing)|belts]] from macramé. They called the process "square knotting" after the knot they used most frequently. Sailors also called macramé "McNamara's lace".&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt;

Though the craze for macramé faded, it regained popularity during the 1970s as a means to make wall hangings, articles of clothing, bedspreads, small jean shorts, [[tablecloth]]s, [[draperies]], plant hangers and other furnishings. By the early 1980s macramé had again begun to fall out of fashion as a decoration trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Chace | first = Susan | last2 = Pennant | first2 = Lilla | last3 = Warde  |first3 = John Maury | last4 = Wright | first4 = David | year = 1981 | title = Crafts &amp; Hobbies | publisher = [[Reader's Digest]] | page = 28 | isbn = 0-89577-063-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WnL6RWTLOcQC&amp;pg=PA28#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macramé jewelry has become popular among the American young and old crowd, starting in the early 1970s. Using mainly square knots and [[granny knot]]s, this jewelry often features handmade glass beads and natural elements such as bone and shell. Necklaces, anklets and bracelets have become popular forms of macramé jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://plus.google.com/photos/114987252639255164965/album/5961184404667827329/6182213837107670098|title=Album - Google+ |website=plus.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
[[File:Macrame Owls.jpg|thumb]]Materials used in macramé include cords made of [[cotton]] twine, [[linen]], [[hemp]], [[jute]], [[leather]] or [[yarn]].  Cords are identified by construction, such as a 3-ply cord, made of three lengths of fibre twisted together.&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;{{cite book|title=Complete Guide to Needlework|year=1979|publisher=The Reader's Digest Association Canada|location=Montreal|isbn=0888500858|pages=445|editor=Virginia Colton}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jewelry is often made in combination of both the knots and various [[beads]] (glass, wooden, and so on), pendants or shells. Sometimes 'found' focal points are used for necklaces, such as rings or [[gemstones]], either wire-wrapped to allow for securing or captured in a net-like array of intertwining [[overhand knot]]s. A knotting board is often used to mount the cords for macramé work. Cords may be held in place using a [[C-clamp]], straight pins, T-pins, U-pins, or upholstery pins.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt;

For larger decorative pieces, such as wall hangings or [[window covering]]s, a work of macramé might be started out on a wooden or metal dowel, allowing for a spread of dozens of cords that are easy to manipulate. For smaller projects, push-pin boards are available specifically for macramé, although a simple corkboard works adequately. Many craft stores offer beginners' kits, work boards, beads and materials ranging in price for the casual hobbyist or ambitious craftsperson.

[[File:KoninklijkeBibliotheek2.jpg|thumb|As the logos on the window show, the RKD shares the same building (located near [[Den Haag Centraal]]) with the {{Interlanguage link multi|Nederlands Letterkundig Museum|nl}} (LM), the [[Huygens Institute for Dutch History|Huygens ING]], the [[Netherlands Music Institute]] (NMI) and the [[National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]].]]

The '''Netherlands Institute for Art History''' or '''RKD''' (Dutch: '''RKD-Nederlands Instituut voor Kunstgeschiedenis''') is located in [[The Hague]] and is home to the largest [[art history]] center in the world. The center specializes in documentation, archives, and books on [[Western art]] from the late Middle Ages until modern times. All of this is open to the public, and much of it has been digitized and is available on their website. The main goal of the bureau is to collect, categorize, and make art research available, most notably in the field of [[Dutch Masters]].

Via the available databases, the visitor can gain insight into archival evidence on the lives of many artists of past centuries. The library owns approximately 450,000 titles, of which ca. 150,000 are auction catalogs. There are ca. 3,000 magazines, of which 600 are currently running subscriptions. Though most of the text is in Dutch, the standard record format includes a link to library entries and images of known works, which include English as well as Dutch titles.

The RKD also manages the Dutch version of the [[Art and Architecture Thesaurus]], a [[thesaurus]] of terms for management of information on art and architecture. The original version is an initiative of the [[Getty Research Institute]] in [[Los Angeles, California]].

==History==
The collection was started through bequests by [[Frits Lugt]], art historian and owner of a massive collection of drawings and prints, and [[Cornelis Hofstede de Groot]] (1863–1930), a collector, art historian and museum curator. Their bequest formed the basis for both the art collection and the library, which is now mostly housed in the [[Koninklijke Bibliotheek, National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]] (National Library).
==Open access website==
Though not all of the library's holdings have been digitised, much of its [[metadata]] is accessible online. The website itself is available in both a Dutch and an English user interface.
===Online artist pages===
In the artist database ''RKDartists'', each artist is assigned a record number. To reference an artist page directly, use the code listed at the bottom of the record, usually of the form: https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/ followed by the artist's record number. For example, the artist record number for [[Salvador Dalí]] is 19752, so his RKD artist page can be referenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/19752 |title=Salvador Dalí |publisher=Netherlands Institute for Art History |date= |accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wikidata property|P650}}
===Online artworks pages===
In the images database ''RKDimages'', each artwork is assigned a record number. To reference an artwork page directly, use the code listed at the bottom of the record, usually of the form: https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/ followed by the artwork's record number. For example, the artwork record number for [[The Night Watch]] is 3063, so its RKD artwork page can be referenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/3063 |title=Civic guardsmen of Amsterdam under command of Banninck Cocq |publisher=Netherlands Institute for Art History |date= |accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wikidata property |P350 }}
{{commons category|RKDimages}}

===Online thesaurus of art terms===
The Art and Architecture Thesaurus also assigns a record for each term, but these can not be referenced online by record number. Rather, they are used in the databases and the databases can be searched for terms. For example, the painting called "The Night Watch" is a militia painting, and all records fitting this keyword (Dutch: ''algemene trefwoord'') can be seen by selecting this from the image screen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images#filters%5BRKD_algemene_trefwoorden%5D=militia%20painting All available records for "militia painting"] in RKDimages&lt;/ref&gt;

The thesaurus is a set of general terms, but the RKD also contains a database for an alternate form of describing artworks, that today is mostly filled with biblical references. This is the [[iconclass]] database. To see all images that depict Miriam's dance, the associated iconclass code 71E1232 can be used as a special search term.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images#filters%5Biconclass_code%5D=71E1232  All available records for iconclass code "71E1232"] in RKDimages&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], a '''pentagonal tiling''' is a [[tiling of the plane]] where each individual piece is in the shape of a [[pentagon]].

A [[regular tiling|regular]] [[pentagonal]] tiling on the [[Euclidean plane]] is impossible because the [[internal angle]] of a [[Pentagon#Regular pentagons|regular pentagon]], 108°, is not a divisor of 360°, the angle measure of a whole [[turn (geometry)|turn]]. However, they can tile the [[Order-4 pentagonal tiling|hyperbolic plane]] and the [[Spherical dodecahedron|sphere]]; the latter produces a tiling topologically equivalent to the [[dodecahedron]].

== Monohedral convex pentagonal tilings ==
[[File:Monohedral_pentagonal_tiling_labels.png|thumb|An example pentagonal tile with angle labels A,B,C,D, and E, and edge length labels a,b,c,d, and e]]

Fifteen types of convex pentagons are known to tile the plane [[monohedral tiling|monohedrally]] (i.e. with one type of tile).&lt;ref&gt;Tilings and Patterns, Sec. 9.3 Other Monohedral tilings by convex polygons&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent one was discovered in 2015.  This list has been shown to be complete by {{harvtxt|Rao|2017}} (result subject to peer-review). {{harvtxt|Bagina|2011}} showed that there are only eight [[Tessellation#Introduction to tessellations|edge-to-edge]] convex types, a result obtained independently by {{harvtxt|Sugimoto|2012}}.

[[Michaël Rao]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/michael.rao/ Michaël Rao]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[École normale supérieure de Lyon]] claimed on 1 May 2017 to have found the proof that there are in fact no more than these 15 monohedral convex pentagonal tilings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/michael.rao/publi/penta.pdf Exhaustive search of convex pentagons which tile the plane]&lt;/ref&gt; Rao's paper is available for peer-review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = 1708.00274|title = Exhaustive search of convex pentagons which tile the plane|last1 = Rao|first1 = Michael|year = 2017|class = math.CO}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 11 July 2017, the first half of the proof had been independently verified (computer code available&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/flyspeck/publications-of-thomas-hales/blob/master/projects_discrete_geom/rao-pentagon-tilings/rao-convex-pentagon.m]&lt;/ref&gt;) by Thomas Hales, a professor of mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.quantamagazine.org/pentagon-tiling-proof-solves-century-old-math-problem-20170711/]&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2017, the proof was not yet fully peer-reviewed.

Each enumerated tiling family contains pentagons that belong to no other type; however, some individual pentagons may belong to multiple types.  In addition, some of the pentagons in the known tiling types also permit alternative tiling patterns beyond the standard tiling exhibited by all members of its type.

The sides of length ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''e'' are directly clockwise from the angles at vertices ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''E'' respectively. (Thus,
''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', ''E'' are opposite to ''d'', ''e'', ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' respectively.)

Many of these monohedral tile types have degrees of freedom. These freedoms include variations of [[internal angle]]s and edge lengths. In the limit, edges may have lengths that approach zero or angles that approach 180°. Types 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 13 allow parametric possibilities with nonconvex prototiles.

Periodic tilings are characterised by their [[wallpaper group]] symmetry, for example [[Wallpaper group#Group p2 (2222)|p2 (2222)]] is defined by four 2-fold gyration points. This nomenclature is used in the diagrams below, where the tiles are also colored by their [[isohedral#K-isohedral|''k''-isohedral]] positions within the symmetry.

A ''[[primitive unit]]'' is a section of the tiling that generates the whole tiling using only translations, and is as small as possible.

=== Reinhardt (1918) ===

{{harvtxt|Reinhardt|1918}} found the first five types of pentagonal tile. All five can create [[isohedral]] tilings, meaning that the symmetries of the tiling can take any tile to any other tile (more formally, the [[automorphism group]] [[group action|acts transitively]] on the tiles).

B. Grünbaum and G. C. Shephard have shown that there are exactly twenty-four distinct "types" of isohedral tilings of the plane by pentagons according to their classification scheme.{{sfn|Grünbaum; Shephard|1978}} All use Reinhardt's tiles, usually with additional conditions necessary for the tiling. There are two tilings by all type 2 tiles, and one by all of each of the other four types. Fifteen of the other eighteen tilings are by special cases of type 1 tiles. Nine of the twenty-four tilings are edge-to-edge.{{sfn|Schattschneider|1978}}

There are also 2-isohedral tilings by special cases of type 1, type 2, and type 4 tiles, and 3-isohedral tilings, all edge-to-edge, by special cases of type 1 tiles. There is no upper bound on k for k-isohedral tilings by certain tiles that are both type 1 and type 2, and hence neither on the number of tiles in a primitive unit.

The [[wallpaper group]] symmetry for each tiling is given, with [[orbifold notation]] in parentheses. A second lower symmetry group is given if tile [[chirality (mathematics)|chirality]] exists, where mirror images are considered distinct. These are shown as yellow and green tiles in those cases.

==== Type 1====
There are many tiling topologies that contain type 1 pentagons. Five example topologies are given below.

==== Type 2====
These type 2 examples are isohedral. The second is an edge-to-edge variation. They both have pgg (22×) symmetry. If mirror image protile tiles (yellow and green) are considered distinct, the symmetry is p2 (2222).

=== Kershner (1968) Types 6, 7, 8 ===
{{harvtxt|Kershner|1968}} found three more types of pentagonal tile, bringing the total to eight. He claimed incorrectly that this was the complete list of pentagons that can tile the plane.

These examples are 2-isohedral and edge-to-edge. Type 8 has chiral pairs of tiles, which are colored as pairs in yellow-green and the other as two shades of blue. The pgg symmetry is reduced to p2 with distinct chiral pairs. The pgg symmetry is reduced to p2 when chiral pairs are considered distinct.

=== James (1975) Type 10===
In 1975 Richard E. James III found a ninth type, after reading about Kershner's results in [[Martin Gardner]]'s "[[Mathematical Games (column)|Mathematical Games]]" column in ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazine of July 1975 (reprinted in {{harvtxt|Gardner|1988}}). It is indexed as type 10. The tiling is 3-isohedral and non-edge-to-edge.

=== Rice (1977) Types 9,11,12,13===
[[Marjorie Rice]], an amateur mathematician, discovered four new types of [[Tessellation|tessellating]] pentagons in 1976 and 1977.{{sfn|Schattschneider|1978}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/intriguingtessellations/home/tessellations|title=Tessellations - Intriguing Tessellations|website=google.com|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All four tilings are 2-isohedral. The chiral pairs of tiles are colored in yellow and green for one isohedral set, and two shades of blue for the other set. The pgg symmetry is reduced to p2 when the chiral pairs are considered distinct.

The tiling by type 9 tiles is edge-to-edge, but the others are not.

Each primitive unit contains eight tiles.

=== Stein (1985) Type 14===
A 14th convex pentagon type was found by Rolf Stein in 1985.{{sfn|Schattschneider|1985}}

The tiling is 3-isohedral and non-edge-to-edge. It has completely determined tiles, with no degrees of freedom. Some exact equations are: &lt;math&gt;b = a \sqrt{\frac{11 \sqrt{57}-25}{8}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sin(B)=\frac{\sqrt{57}-3}{8}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\cos(B)=-\sqrt{\frac{3 \sqrt{57}-1}{32}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tan(B)=-\frac{1}{4} \sqrt{3 \sqrt{57}-15}&lt;/math&gt;. Other relations can easily be deduced.

The primitive units contain six tiles respectively. It has p2 (2222) symmetry.

=== Mann/McLoud/Von Derau (2015) Type 15===
[[University of Washington Bothell]] mathematicians Casey Mann, [[Jennifer McLoud-Mann]], and David Von Derau discovered a 15th monohedral tiling convex pentagon in 2015 using a [[computer algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Attack on the pentagon results in discovery of new mathematical tile |first=Alex |last=Bellos |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=11 August 2015 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2015/aug/10/attack-on-the-pentagon-results-in-discovery-of-new-mathematical-tile}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper was published in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1510.01186|last1=Mann|first1=Casey|title=Convex pentagons that admit $i$-block transitive tilings|last2=McLoud-Mann|first2=Jennifer|author3=David Von Derau|class=math.MG|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is 3-isohedral and non-edge-to-edge, drawn with 6 colors, 2 shades of 3 colors, representing chiral pairs of the three isohedral positions. The pgg symmetry is reduced to p2 when the chiral pairs are consided distinct.

It has completely determined tiles, with no degrees of freedom. The primitive units contain twelve tiles respectively. It has pgg (22×) symmetry, and p2 (2222) if chiral pairs are considered distinct.

In July 2017 Michaël Rao completed a computer-assisted proof showing that there are no other types of convex pentagons that can tile the plane.  The complete list of convex polygons that can tile the plane includes the above 15 pentagons, three types of hexagons, and all quadrilaterals and triangles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Pentagon Tiling Proof Solves Century-Old Math Problem |first=Natalie |last=Wolchover |newspaper=[[Quanta Magazine]] |date=11 July 2017 |url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/pentagon-tiling-proof-solves-century-old-math-problem-20170711/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A consequence of this proof is that no convex polygon exists that tiles the plane only aperiodically, since all of the above types allow for a periodic tiling.

=== Nonperiodic monohedral pentagons tilings===
Nonperiodic monohedral pentagonal tilings can also be constructed, like the example below with 6-fold [[rotational symmetry]] by Michael Hirschhorn. Angles are A = 140°, B = 60°, C = 160°, D = 80°, E = 100°.

In 2016 it could be shown by Bernhard Klaassen that every discrete rotational symmetry type can be represented by a monohedral pentagonal tiling from the same class of pentagons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klaassen|first=Bernhard|date=2016|title=Rotationally symmetric tilings with convex pentagons and hexagons|journal=Elemente der Mathematik|volume=71|issue=4|pages=137–144|doi=10.4171/em/310|issn=0013-6018|arxiv=1509.06297}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv|last=Klaassen|first=Bernhard|date=2016|title=Rotationally Symmetric Tilings with Convex Pentagons and Hexagons|eprint=1509.06297|class=math.MG}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples for 5-fold and 7-fold symmetry are shown below. Such tilings are possible for any type of ''n''-fold rotational symmetry with ''n''&gt;2.

== Dual uniform tilings ==

There are three [[isohedral]] pentagonal tilings generated as [[Dual (polyhedron)|duals]] of the [[uniform tiling]]s, those with 5-valence vertices. They represent special higher symmetry cases of the 15 monohedral tilings above. Uniform tilings and their duals are all edge-to-edge. These dual tilings are also called [[Laves tiling]]s. The symmetry of the uniform dual tilings is the same as the uniform tilings. Because the uniform tilings are [[isogonal figure|isogonal]], the duals are [[isohedral figure|isohedral]].

=== Dual ''k''-uniform tilings ===
The [[k-uniform tiling|''k''-uniform tilings]] with valence-5 vertices also have pentagonal dual tilings, containing the same three shaped pentagons as the semiregular duals above, but contain a mixture of pentagonal types. A ''k''-uniform tiling has a ''k''-isohedral dual tiling and are represented by different colors and shades of colors below.

For example these 2, 3, 4, and 5-uniform duals are all pentagonal:{{sfn|Chavey|1989}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://probabilitysports.com/tilings.html n-uniform tilings], Brian Galebach&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pentagonal/hexagonal tessellation ==
[[File:Pentagonal Tessellation of Hexagons.png|thumb|Pentagonal subdivisions of a hexagon]]
Pentagons have a peculiar relationship with hexagons. As demonstrated graphically below, some types of hexagons can be subdivided into pentagons. For example, a regular hexagon bisects into two type 1 pentagons. Subdivision of convex hexagons is also possible with three (type 3), four (type 4) and nine (type 3) pentagons.

By extension of this relation, a plane can be tessellated by a single pentagonal prototile shape in ways that generate hexagonal overlays. For example:
{| class=wikitable width=700
|- valign=top
|[[File:Pent-Hex-Type1-2.png|175px]]&lt;BR&gt;Planar tessellation by a single pentagonal prototile (type 1) with overlays of regular hexagons (each comprising 2 pentagons).
|[[File:Pent-Hex-Type3-3.png|175px]]&lt;BR&gt;Planar tessellation by a single pentagonal prototile (type 3) with overlays of regular hexagons (each comprising 3 pentagons).
|[[File:Pent-Hex-Type4-4.png|175px]]&lt;BR&gt;Planar tessellation by a single pentagonal prototile (type 4) with overlays of semiregular hexagons (each comprising 4 pentagons).
|[[File:Pent-Hex-Type3-9.png|175px]]&lt;BR&gt;Planar tessellation by a single pentagonal prototile (type 3) with overlays of two sizes of regular hexagons (comprising 3 and 9 pentagons respectively).
|}

== Non-convex pentagons ==
[[File:Sphinx tiling pg a.svg|thumb|Periodic tiling by the sphinx]]
With pentagons that are not required to be [[convex polygon|convex]], additional types of tiling are possible. An example is the [[sphinx tiling]], an [[aperiodic tiling]] formed by a pentagonal [[rep-tile]].{{sfn|Godrèche|1989}} The sphinx may also tile the plane periodically, by fitting two sphinx tiles together to form a [[parallelogram]] and then tiling the plane by translates of this parallelogram,{{sfn|Godrèche|1989}} a pattern that can be extended to any non-convex pentagon that has two consecutive angles adding to 2{{pi}}, thus satisfying the condition(s) of convex [[#Type 1|Type 1]] above.

It is possible to divide an [[equilateral triangle]] into three congruent non-convex pentagons, meeting at the center of the triangle, and to tile the plane with the resulting three-pentagon unit.{{sfn|Gerver|2003}}
A similar method can be used to subdivide [[square]]s into four congruent non-convex pentagons, or [[regular hexagon]]s into six congruent non-convex pentagons, and then tile the plane with the resulting unit.

== Regular pentagonal tilings in non-Euclidean geometry ==
A [[dodecahedron]] can be considered a regular tiling of 12 pentagons on the surface of a [[sphere]], with [[Schläfli symbol]] {5,3}, having three pentagons around each vertex.

In the [[hyperbolic geometry#Models of the hyperbolic plane|hyperbolic plane]], there are tilings of regular pentagons, for instance [[order-4 pentagonal tiling]], {5,4}, having four pentagons around each vertex. Higher order regular tilings {5,n} can be constructed on the hyperbolic plane, ending in {5,∞}.

'''[[Performance art]] in China''' has been growing since the 1970s as a response to the very traditional nature of Chinese state-run [[art schools]]. It is becoming more and more popular in spite of the fact that it is currently outlawed. In 1999 the importance of contemporary [[China|Chinese]] art was recognized by the inclusion of 19 contemporary [[Chinese artist]]s in the [[Venice Biennale]]. In recent years many of these artists have made performances specifically for photography or film. 

==Examples==
Some of the more extreme examples of Chinese performance art have become notorious in the West. In 2000, [[Zhu Yu (artist)|Zhu Yu]], a painter and performance artist from Cheng Du, created a scandal by taking a number of photographs of himself, supposedly eating a [[foetus]] as a protest against state [[abortion]]s as a means of population control. [[Sun Yuan &amp; Peng Yu|Peng Yu and Sun Yuan]] have also worked with human body parts as well as with live animals and are equally notorious. Some younger performance artists who have exhibited widely in the west in 2005-6 are [[Shu Yang]], the organiser  of the Dadao Live Art Festival in Beijing, [[Yang Zhichao]], famous for having his identity card number branded on his back and [[Wang Chuyu]] who went on hunger strike as part of an exhibition called [[Fuck Off (art exhibition)|Fuck Off]] that took place in Shanghai in 2000 in opposition to the Shanghai Biennale. They acknowledge a debt to older performance artist and curator [[Ai Weiwei]]. Other well-known artists are [[Ma Liuming]], [[Zhu Ming]], and [[He Yunchang]].

The 1996 film ''[[Frozen (1997 film)|Frozen]]'' (Chinese title: Jidu Hanleng; 极度寒冷) by Chinese director [[Wang Xiaoshuai]], made under the pseudonym Wu Ming, has as its protagonists a group of Chinese performance artists, who are shown engaging in several street performances in the film.

'''Phamaly Theatre Company''' (formerly the '''Physically Handicapped Actors &amp; Musical Artists League''' or '''PHAMALy'''), also known as just '''Phamaly''' (as in "family"), is a theater group and touring company based in [[Denver, Colorado]] formed entirely of people with disabilities from across the spectrum.{{r|Moore-2015}} Phamaly was founded in 1989 by a group of former students of the Boettcher School, a now-closed school for the disabled.{{r|ACA}} The students were frustrated with the lack of theatrical opportunities for people with disabilities and wanted to create a theatre company that provided those individuals with the opportunity to perform.{{r|about}} Phamaly Theatre Company performs primarily at the [[Denver Performing Arts Complex]] and the Aurora Fox Theatre.{{r|where}}  The company's season also includes various touring and educational shows.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9000">The '''Photo League''' was a cooperative of photographers in New York who banded together around a range of common social and creative causes. The League was active from 1936 to 1951 and included among its members some of the most noted American photographers of the mid-20th century.

== History ==

The League’s origins traced back to a project of the [[Workers International Relief]] (WIR), which was a communist association based in Berlin. In 1930 the WIR established the Worker’s Camera League in New York City, which soon came to be known as the [[Workers Film and Photo League|Film and Photo League]]. The goals of the Film and Photo League were to “struggle against and expose reactionary film; to produce documentary films reflecting the lives and struggles of the American workers; and to spread and popularize the great artistic and revolutionary Soviet productions.”&lt;ref name="Tucker"&gt;{{cite book|first=Anne|last=Tucker|authorlink=Anne Wilkes Tucker|title=The Photo League: Photography as a Social Force|publisher="Modern Photography"|date=September 1979|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 the still photographers and the filmmakers in the League began having differences of opinion over social and production interests, and by 1936 they had formed separate groups. [[Paul Strand]] and [[Ralph Steiner]] established Frontier Films, to continue promoting the original goals, while at the same time Strand and [[Berenice Abbott]] renamed the original group “The Photo League”.  The two organizations remained friendly, with members from one group often participating in activities of the other. The goal of the newly reformed Photo League was to “put the camera back into the hands of honest photographers who ... use it to photograph America.”&lt;ref name="Tucker"/&gt;

The League quickly became active in the new field of socially conscious photography. Unlike other photography organizations, it did not espouse a particular visual style but instead focused on “integrating formal elements of design and visual aesthetics with the powerful and sympathetic evidence of the human condition.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Betsi Meissner|title=Original Sources: Art and Archives at the Center for Creative Photography|publisher=Center for Creative Photography|year=2002|pages=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also offered basic and advanced classes in photography when there were few such courses in colleges or trade schools. A newsletter, called ''Photo Notes'', was printed on a somewhat random schedule depending upon who was available to do the work and if they could afford the printing costs. More than anything else, though, the League was a gathering place for photographers to share and experience their common artistic and social interests.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Wilkes Tucker|Tucker]] (2001), p 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

Among its members were co-founders [[Sol Libsohn]] and [[Sid Grossman]] (director of the Photo League School); [[Walter Rosenblum]], editor of the Photo League ''Photo Notes''; [[Eliot Elisofon]], a [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine photographer; [[Morris Engel]] (since 1936); [[Jerome Liebling]], who joined in 1947; [[Aaron Siskind]]; Jack Manning, a member of the Harlem Document Group of the League and a ''New York Times'' photographer; [[Dan Weiner]]; Bill Witt; [[Martin Elkort]]; [[Lou Bernstein]]; [[Arthur Leipzig]] (since 1942); [[Sy Kattelson]]; [[Louis Stettner]]; Lester Talkington (from 1947); [[Lisette Model]]; and [[Ruth Orkin]], a member from 1947.&lt;ref&gt;These are the names singled out by Time-Life in their volume on the documentary (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusual for artist groups at the time, approximately one-third of League members and participants were women and they served in visible leadership roles such as secretary, treasurer, vice president, and president. For example, [[Lucy Ashjian]], who joined the League as early as 1936, served as ''Photos Notes'' editor and board chair of the League's school.&lt;ref name="Klein-Evans"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klein |first1=Mason |last2=Evans |first2=Catherine |date=2011 |title= The Radical Camera: New York's Photo League, 1936-1951 |chapter=As Good as the Guys: The Women of the Photo League |publisher=Yale University Press and The Jewish Museum |isbn=978-0-300-14687-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1940s the list of notable photographers who were active in the League or supported their activities also included [[Margaret Bourke-White]], [[W. Eugene Smith]], [[Helen Levitt]], FSA photographer [[Arthur Rothstein]], [[Beaumont Newhall]], [[Nancy Newhall]], [[Richard Avedon]], [[Weegee]], [[Robert Frank]], [[Harold Feinstein]], [[Ansel Adams]], [[Edward Weston]] and [[Minor White]]. The League was the caretaker of the [[Lewis Hine]] Memorial Collection, which Hine's son had given the League in recognition of their role in fostering social activism through photography as his father had done.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Wilkes Tucker|Tucker]] (2001), p 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the members who joined before the end of [[World War II]] were first-generation Americans who strongly believed in progressive political and social causes. Few were aware of the political origins of the movement of the communist "Workers as Photographers" (''Arbeiterfotografen'') in Berlin. This had in fact little to do with what the organization did as it evolved, but helped its downfall after the war, when it was accused by the FBI of being communist and "subversive and anti-American." 
In 1947 the League was formally declared subversive and placed on the U.S. Department of Justice [[blacklist]] by Attorney General [[Tom C. Clark]]. At first the League fought back and mounted an impressive ''This Is the Photo League'' exhibition in 1948, but after its member and long-time FBI informer [[Angela Calomiris]] had testified in May 1949 that the League was a front organization for the [[CPUSA|Communist Party]], the Photo League was finished. Recruitment dried up and old members left, including one of its founders and former president, [[Paul Strand]], as well as Louis Stettner. The League disbanded in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/art/photo/league/index.html ''Where Do We Go from Here? The Photo League and Its Legacy 1936–2006'']&lt;/ref&gt;

After the League’s demise, and coupled with the return of more women to domestic roles in the Post-War era, the careers of many promising women artists, such as [[Sonia Handelman Meyer]] and [[Rae Russel]], did not continue.&lt;ref name="Klein-Evans"/&gt;

The Photo League was the subject of a 2012 documentary film: ''Ordinary Miracles: The Photo League's New York'' by filmmakers Daniel Allentuck and [[Nina Rosenblum]].

'''Playwrights Guild of Canada''' (PGC) is a registered national arts service association mandated to advance the creative rights and interests of professional Canadian [[playwright]]s, promote Canadian plays nationally and internationally, and foster an active, evolving community of writers for the stage.&lt;ref name="PGC"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.playwrightscanada.com |title= Playwrights Guild of Canada |publisher= Playwrights Guild of Canada|accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1972 as the Playwrights Co-op.&lt;ref name="CdnEncyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/playwrights-guild-of-canada/ |title= Playwrights Guild of Canada, The |publisher= [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main purpose was to publish and distribute scripts to encourage more productions of Canadian plays. Since then, it has grown and now provides programs and services for playwrights across the country, and now includes more than 900 playwrights. PGC provides promotional and advocacy programs and services for the creative rights of [[Canada|Canadian]] playwrights.

Through its independently run subsidiary, [[Playwrights Canada Press]], which was established in 2002, PGC is a primary source for unpublished Canadian plays, as well as information regarding [[performance right]]s.&lt;ref name="PGC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CdnEncyclopedia"/&gt;

To help support and advance Canadian playwriting, PGC offers the following services to its members:
* Publication of ''CanScene'', PGC's monthly newsletter, which includes calls for submissions, jobs and other opportunities;
* Promotion of Canadian playwrights via print publications, the PGC website, social media networks, and other means;
* Advertising, selling, and distributing published and unpublished plays;
* Administering amateur production rights;
* Facilitating the [[Canada Council]] Readings Program, which creates opportunities for organizations such as universities, libraries and community groups to invite Canadian playwrights to read in public venues by paying the playwright's reading fees and subsidizing their travel expenses;
* Professional development workshops;
* And overseeing member enrollment in the [https://www.afbs.ca/ AFBS] RRSP Investment Plan and the Writer's Coalition Insurance Program.

PGC also publishes ''CanRevue'', an electronic catalogue of Canadian Copyscript plays, on a monthly timetable. ''CanRevue'' promotes new Canadian plays and is sometimes released as a special edition pertaining to genre or geographical region. In 2011, PGC added a section within ''CanRevue'' entitled "Stage Ready". This is intended to narrow the gap between a written work and a production, and allows members to send PGC plays that have not yet been produced, but are ready to be promoted for the stage. ''CanRevue'' is sent out to over two hundred theatres (both professional and amateur) and to schools across Canada.

==History==
PGC had its origins in a meeting held in 1971 by the Canada Council's theatre officer, David Gardner, with [[Carol Bolt]], [[Tom Hendry]], and [[Len Peterson]] to discuss issues affecting [[English Canadian]] playwrights.&lt;ref name="CdnEncyclopedia"/&gt; Those present at the meeting determined that there was a need for a publishing house for Canadian plays. Following the meeting, Bolt, Hendry and Peterson established the Toronto Playwrights Circle to obtain funding for the project.&lt;ref name="CdnEncyclopedia"/&gt; This led to the founding of the Playwrights Co-op of Canada in the following year, for the purpose of publishing and distributing plays written by Canadian playwrights.&lt;ref name="CdnEncyclopedia"/&gt; In 1979, the Playwrights Co-op changed its name to Playwrights Canada, Inc.

In 1977, the Guild of Canadian Playwrights formed to advocate on behalf of playwrights and to lobby for suitable working conditions for Canadian playwrights. In 1982, the Guild of Canadian Playwrights and Playwrights Canada, Inc. merged to form the Playwrights Union of Canada. In 2002, the organization changed its name to the Playwrights Guild of Canada.&lt;ref name="CdnEncyclopedia"/&gt; That same year, it established its publishing arm, the Playwrights Canada Press.&lt;ref name="CdnEncyclopedia"/&gt;

The Playwrights Guild of Canada is a registered [[Charitable organziations (Canada)|charitable organization]]. In 1986, PGC created the Canadian Drama Foundation (formerly known as the Foundation for Recognition of Excellence in Drama)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canadahelps.org/CharityProfilePage.aspx?CharityID=s67275&lt;/ref&gt; as its charitable arm. Part of its funding comes from the [[Canada Council]], the [[Ontario Arts Council]], Ontario Ministry of Culture, and the City of [[Toronto]] through the Toronto Arts Council.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The Guild has a Women's Caucus, which awards the "Bra D'Or" ("Golden Bra") for supporting the work of female playwrights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.straight.com/article-330069/vancouver/touchstone-theatres-katrina-dunn-feted-being-femalefriendly |title=Touchstone Theatre's Katrina Dunn feted for being female-friendly |date=2010-06-21 |publisher=The Georgia Straight |accessdate=2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PGC celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2012 with a series of special events, such as a week-long play reading series in May that included Maja Ardal, Drew Hayden Taylor, Hannah Moscovitch, Brad Fraser, and Marcia Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://quillandquire.com/book-news/2012/05/01/playwrights-guild-of-canada-celebrates-40-years-with-reading-series/|title=Playwrights Guild of Canada celebrates 40 years with reading series {{!}} Quill and Quire|date=2012-05-01|work=Quill and Quire|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, PGC opened the Canadian Play Outlet (CPO) at 401 Richmond Street West, a physical bookstore with a selection of over 2000 published and unpublished plays by Canadian playwrights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canadianplayoutlet.com/|title=Canadian Play Outlet|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Canadian Play Outlet|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

PGC has an annual awards competition with several categories: Lifetime Membership, Honorary Membership, Post-Secondary Competition, the Bra D'Or Award, Carol Bolt Award for Playwrights, Stage West Pechet Family Comedy Award, and [[Stage West Pechet Family Musical Award]]. The awards were recently named the Tom Hendry Awards after Tom Hendry, a founding member of PGC who died in 2012. The awards carry generous cash prizes and winners are recognized in a ceremony occurring in the fall each year. Deadlines for the awards are April 30 and May 31.

As in previous years, in the future the awards ceremony will continue to forge relationships with other arts organizations and corporate sponsors, celebrating excellence in Canadian playwriting.

[[Image:Huguet-estructuraStAgusti.png|thumb|Possible original layout of the altarpiece, following F. Ruiz i Quesada]]
The  '''''Saint Augustine Altarpiece''''' is a [[Catalan Gothic]] painting in [[egg tempera]] by [[Jaume Huguet]] and [[Pau Vergós]] made between 1462 and 1475. The long duration of the work was caused by financial reasons, and it is assumed that work was begun by Huguet and finished by other members of his workshop, in particular [[Pau Vergós]]. The [[altarpiece]] was commissioned by the guild of [[tanner (occupation)|tanner]]s to be placed on the altar of the [[Augustinian]] [[friary]] of [[Sant Agustí Vell]] ("Old St Augustine") in [[Barcelona]], Spain. The panel measures 250 x 193 x 9.5 cm and has been in the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]] in [[Barcelona]] since 1927. &lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=b0bc6ed7bfb56723bcb9d02396e67d3c071f237560d018de09a6b46dda289842?inventoryNumber=024140-000&amp;lang=en Artwork at MNAC Website]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Comparisons with similar works that survive complete suggest that there were originally several more panels than the eight that now survive, seven in the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|MNAC]] and one in the [[Museu Marès]], also in Barcelona. They would have been framed in an elaborate [[gilding|gilt]] wooden setting as a [[retable]] behind the main altar.  The grandeur of the work makes it the most important painting of the fifteenth century in [[Catalonia]].

== Description ==
In 1463 the Guild of Tanners commissioned an altarpiece from Jaume Huguet for the high altar in the church of Sant Agustí Vell in Barcelona. The unusual size of the piece, one of the largest in Catalan Gothic painting, and the crisis the country was going through at the time, delayed completion of the altarpiece until 1486 and  involved several members of the Huguet workshop, and in particular a member of the Vergós family. Eight panels from this altarpiece are preserved, seven at the MNAC and another at the Museu Marès. The quality of the composition and the pictorial technique of the 'Consecration of Saint Augustine' suggest it can be considered the personal work of the great master.

Typically for Catalan painting at this date, which was conservative by Italian standards, the panel still has a "gold ground" background, decorated in textile-like patterns of ''[[pastiglia]]'' [[stucco]] relief, which is also used for the [[crozier]]s and jewels on the [[mitre]]s and [[vestment]]s of the figures.  Saint [[Augustine]], the dedicatee of the church, is shown being consecrated by several other bishops as [[Bishop of Hippo]] in Roman North Africa, which happened in 395, although the painting shows entirely contemporary styles of dress.  The unvested figure reading a book in a ''chemise'' covering on the left is a [[donor portrait]] of one of the friars, probably the head of the community.  Another friar's head, looking like a portrait, peeps out at the rear right.

== History ==
The work on the altarpiece began on July 20, 1452 when the carpenter Macia Bonafé was given the contract to construct the retable.  It was stipulated that the altarpiece was to rest on a stone base with doors on either side leading to the sacristy.  Bonafé was also to create a figure of the Madonna, which was to rest in a [[niche (architecture)|niche]], as well as the heraldic lions of the guild.  On the same day Bonafé received his contract, the guildsmen engaged [[Luis Dalmau]] to begin working on painting as soon as the construction of the retable was finished.  Dalmau ended up doing no actual work on the piece, for reasons unknown, and on December 4, 1463, the contract was given to Jaume Huguet.  For payment, Huguet received one hundred and ten lliures on February 1 and July 1 of 1464, and was thereafter to draw fifty six lliures every Christmas until the full amount had been paid.&lt;ref name=Rowland&gt;Rowland (1932)&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole arrangement was very businesslike with very clear instructions on how Huguet was to proceed.  He was first to paint the four panels of the [[predella]] with scenes from the Passion as conceived in a sketch that he had presented to the guild, and this portion was to be completed by Christmas, 1466.  Huguet was also tasked with painting the figures of saints on the [[sacristy]] doors, coloring the statues, and painting the heraldic lions.  Before he was allowed to begin any painting, he had to present drawings for the approval of the guild and two painters, one chosen by the guild and the other chosen by Huguet.  With the expectation that much of the work would be done by assistants, as it was a very large undertaking, it was specified that Huguet himself would be responsible for painting the heads and hands.&lt;ref name=Rowland/&gt;

It is not until November 29, 1486 that the altarpiece is spoken of as being completed, twenty three years after Huguet was originally commissioned.  The documents also show that Huguet was not paid as originally promised and did not receive his full sum until 1488, when he was still owed 200 lliures.  The reasons for the delay are unknown, but there a couple conjectures as to what happened.  One is that the Constable Dom Pedro arrived six weeks after the contract was drawn up and engaged Huguet to paint him a retable, which would have taken precedence over that of the guild.  It could also be that the guild lost interest or had a lack of finances that temporarily halted the project.&lt;ref name=Rowland/&gt;

'''''Semiotics of the Kitchen''''' is a [[feminism|feminist]] [[parody]] [[video]] and [[performance art|performance piece]] released in 1975 by [[Martha Rosler]]. The video, which runs six minutes, is considered a critique of the commodified versions of traditional women's roles in modern society.

== Scenario ==
Featuring Rosler as a generic [[cooking show]] [[Television presenter|host]], the camera observes as she presents an array of kitchen hand utensils, many of them outdated or strange, and, after identifying them, demonstrates unproductive, sometimes violent, uses for each. It uses a largely static camera and a plain set. 

Letter by letter, Rosler navigates a [[culinary arts|culinary]] lexicon, using a different kitchen implement for each step along the way. She begins with an [[apron]], which she ties around her waist, and, with deadpan humor, journeys through the alphabet, until the last few letters. For these, U, V, W, X,Y, and Z, the implements are dispensed with and Rosler's gestures and body become a signal system themselves. The Z replicates the mark of Zorro, a filmic reference, and at the end of the entire work the artist offers a shrug, somehow defusing the negative reading of the parody. The focus on [[linguistics]] and words is important, since Rosler intended the video to challenge "the familiar system of everyday kitchen meanings -- the securely understood signs of domestic industry and food production."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web | title =Semiotics of the Kitchen | publisher =Electronic Arts Intermix | year =2006 | url =http://www.eai.org/eai/tape.jsp?itemID=1545 | accessdate =2006-11-14  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006090705/http://www.eai.org/eai/tape.jsp?itemID=1545 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Meaning ==
A well-known feminist, Rosler remarked about this work that "when the woman speaks, she names her own oppression." The symbolic terminology of the kitchen, she hypothesized, transforms the woman into a sign of the system of food production and harnessed subjectivity. The video subject is an "anti-[[Julia Child]]," Rosler explains; she "replaces the domesticated 'meaning' of tools with a lexicon of rage and frustration."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The work was intended, like all early video, to be shown on a television monitor, and thus it is no accident that some of the gestures represent a tossing or throwing of the imaginary contents of certain implements [[Thinking outside the box|"outside the box"]] of television programming. It is not the production of food in and of itself that is Rosler's target but the taken-for-granted role of happy housewife and selfless producer that the tape intends to spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Food for Thought: A Video Art Sampler | publisher =The Jewish Museum | date = 2006-10-31 | url =http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/site/pages/onlinex.php?id=152&amp;PHPSESSID=69e501015f90f808e1a2bb69c25d5f72 
  | accessdate =2006-11-14  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her gestures demonstrate frustration with the language of domesticity, as she uses the domestic space of the kitchen as a backdrop for resistance and change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/online/watch_this/|title =Watch This!

In [[folklore]], a '''simpleton''' is a person whose foolish actions are the subject of often-repeated stories. Simpletons are also known as '''noodles''', '''fools''', and '''gothamites'''.  Folklore often holds, with no basis in fact, that certain towns or countries are thought to be home to large numbers of simpletons. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] told tales of stupid populations in [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] and other cities; in [[Germany]], men of [[Schilda]] are conspicuous in these stories; in [[Spain]] hundreds of jokes exist about the supposed foolishness of the people from [[Lepe]]; and in [[England]], the village of [[Gotham, Nottinghamshire|Gotham]] in Nottinghamshire is reputed to be populated by simpletons. In [[Sri Lanka]] whole districts in the central, southern, and western provinces are credited with being the abode of foolish people.&lt;ref name='Noodles'&gt;{{cite book | last = Clouston | first = W.

Tales of simpleton behavior have often been collected into books, and early joke books include many simpleton jokes. In ancient Greece, [[Philogelos|Hierokles]] created such a collection. In England, the famous ''[[Joe Miller (actor)|Joe Miller's Jests]]'' is highly inclusive of simpleton jokes. In Britain the Irish are often stereotyped as stupid&lt;ref name="Noodles"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Miller's Jests|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40127/40127-h/40127-h.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Worstall|first=Tim|title=Forbes|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/01/03/it-would-have-to-be-the-irish-newspapers-trying-something-insanely-stupid-like-charging-for-links-to-websites/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cantwell|first=Billy|title=Irish Echo|url=http://www.irishecho.com.au/2011/07/17/comment-time-for-the-stupid-irish-joke-to-be-laid-to-rest/11036}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and are the butt of [[An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman]] jokes. Books of simpleton tales exist in [[Persian Empire|Persia]], [[Ireland]], [[Turkey]], [[Iceland]], [[Japan]], [[Sicily]], and [[India]].&lt;ref name="Noodles"/&gt; 

Simpleton tales are huge in number, but many of them share the same notions of simple-minded behavior. Many are repeated, with altered names, settings, characters, etc., in language after language and collection after collection. 

A very old such tale from England is&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a man of Gotham that rode to the market with two bushels of wheat, and because his horse should not be damaged by carrying too great a burden, he was determined to carry the corn himself upon his own neck, and still kept riding upon his horse till he arrived at the end of his journey. Now I will leave you to judge which was the wisest, his horse or himself.&lt;ref name='Gotham'&gt;{{cite book | last = Halliwell | first = James Orchard | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Merry Tales of the Wise Men of Gotham | publisher = John Russell Smith | date = 1840 | location = London | pages = | url = http://www.presscom.co.uk/gotham.html | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A famous one from ancient Greece is&lt;blockquote&gt;A man's father having died, the son dutifully took the body to the embalmers. When he returned at the appointed time to take it, there happened to be a number of bodies in the same place, so he was asked if his father had any peculiarity by which his body might be recognised, and the simpleton replied, "He had a cough."&lt;ref name="Noodles"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Strahlendes Klima e.V''' is a registered [[non-profit organization]] that produces films and media focusing on the issues of energy and resources for an [[environmentally friendly]], more climate conscious world. Their main concept is to build a [[decentralised]] activist network in order to distribute topical content in terms of [[open licence]] publications. By offering free educational media they aim to raise awareness for environmental conservation.&lt;ref name="Educational media for German schools at Deutscher Bildungsserver"&gt;

== History ==
In late 2006 political scientist [[Kerstin Schnatz]] and cinematographer [[Isabel Huber]] began to research on uranium. They intended to do a documentary film focussing on the origins of nuclear power, especially the [[nuclear cycle]] and [[uranium mining]]. After having gathered a film crew of volunteers, the film was shot in Australia, France and Germany. In 2009 the international version of the documentary "Uranium - is it a country?" (53 min.) was released and nominated for the newcomer's award "Goldener Schlüssel" at [[Kasseler Dokumentarfilm- und Videofest]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="Dok-Fest Kassel 2009"&gt;

                      }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film crew decided to distribute the documentary under an [[open licence]] model&lt;ref name="Uranium - is it a country? - Licence"&gt;

to spread the content. The film has been screened thousands of times all around the world due to its [[decentralised]] [[Film distributor|distribution]] coordinated by online networking activists.
It has been used heavily for political campaigning up to the [[German federal election]] in September 2009&lt;ref name="Screening Ludwigsburg"&gt;

In the summer of 2010 the film crew decided to found a [[non-profit organisation]] (Strahlendes Klima e.V.) to keep up the work on envirenmental issues.

== Activities ==

Strahlendes Klima e.V. helps activists to organize film screenings and debates on environmental issues.
They organise workshops for schools and non-profits and release educational films and media on a regular basis. In 2010 "At Eyelevel" their film about [[indigenous peoples]] facing the problems of uranium mining was released.

In 2011 [[Goethe Institut]]-Shanghai invited the organisation to visit [[China]]. A short film treating [[renewable energies]] in China is expected to be released in mid-2012.&lt;ref name="Projekt China"&gt;
                      {{cite web

'''Frederick Bean''' "'''Tex'''" '''Avery''' (February 26, 1908 – August 26, 1980) was an American [[animator]], [[animation director|director]], [[cartoonist]] and [[voice acting|voice actor]], known for producing and directing animated cartoons during the [[golden age of American animation]]. His most significant work was for the [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] studios, where he was crucial in the creation and evolution of famous animated characters such as [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]], [[Porky Pig]], [[Elmer Fudd]], [[Droopy]], [[Screwy Squirrel]], [[George and Junior]] and [[Chilly Willy]].

Gary Morris described Avery's innovative approach:&lt;blockquote&gt;Above all, [Avery] steered the Warner Bros. house style away from Disney-esque sentimentality and made cartoons that appealed equally to adults, who appreciated Avery's speed, sarcasm, and irony, and to kids, who liked the nonstop action. Disney's "cute and cuddly" creatures, under Avery's guidance, were transformed into unflappable wits like Bugs Bunny, endearing buffoons like Porky Pig, or dazzling crazies like Daffy Duck. Even the classic fairy tale, a market that Disney had cornered, was appropriated by Avery, who made innocent heroines like [[Red Riding Hood]] into sexy jazz babes, more than a match for any Wolf. Avery also endeared himself to intellectuals by constantly breaking through the artifice of the cartoon, having characters leap out of the end credits, loudly object to the plot of the cartoon they were starring in, or speak directly to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/quickie-look-life-career-tex-avery/#.Vg6ii-xViko |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150308075346/http://brightlightsfilm.com/quickie-look-life-career-tex-avery/#.Vg6ii-xViko |dead-url=yes|title=A Quickie Look at the Life &amp; Career of Tex Avery - Bright Lights Film Journal |publisher=Brightlightsfilm.com |date= 1998-09-02|accessdate=2018-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Avery's style of directing encouraged animators to stretch the boundaries of the medium to do things in a cartoon that could not be done in the world of live-action film. An often-quoted line about Avery's cartoons was, "In a cartoon you can do anything."&lt;ref name = "Adamson"&gt;Adamson, Joe, ''Tex Avery: King of Cartoons'', New York: Da Capo Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; He also performed a great deal of voice work in his cartoons, usually throwaway bits (''e.g.'' the [[Santa Claus]] seen briefly in ''[[Who Killed Who?]]''); Avery also voiced Junior from ''[[George and Junior]]'', as well as occasionally filling in for [[Bill Thompson (voice actor)|Bill Thompson]] as Droopy.

==Early years==
Avery was born to George Walton Avery (1867–1935) and Mary Augusta "Jessie" (née Bean; 1886–1931) in [[Taylor, Texas]]. His father was born in [[Alabama]] and his  mother was born in [[Chickasaw County, Mississippi]]. His paternal grandparents were Needham Avery (an [[American Civil War]] veteran; October 8, 1838 – February 20, 1913, buried at Wehadkee Primitive Baptist Church Cemetery, [[Randolph County, Alabama]]) and his wife, Lucinda C. Baxly (May 11, 1844 – March 10, 1892). His maternal grandparents were Frederick Mumford Bean (1852 – October 23, 1886) and his wife Minnie Edgar (July 25, 1854 – May 7, 1940). His paternal great-grandparents were John Walton Avery (December 16, 1805 – January 13, 1878, buried at Rock Springs Cemetery, Randolph County, Alabama) and wife Elizabeth Brannon (née Tomme) Avery (October 17, 1809 – October 15, 1895, buried at Mount Pisgah Primitive Baptist Church Cemetery, [[Chambers County, Alabama|Stroud, Chambers County, Alabama]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~celebrities/averytex.html |title=A listing of his ancestry for five generations |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avery, nicknamed "Tex", "Fred", and "Texas", was born and raised in Taylor, Texas, a small town in the vicinity of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. Avery graduated in 1926 from [[North Dallas High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parks|first=Scott K.|title=North Dallas High murals pay homage to animated alumnus Tex Avery|newspaper=Dallas Morning News|date=February 21, 2010|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/022210dnmettexavery.3dc1d7c.html|accessdate=February 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (2003), Warner Bros., pp. unnumbered pages&lt;/ref&gt; A popular [[catchphrase]] at his school was "What's up, doc?",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Haile|first=Bartee|title=Nothing Funny About Sad Life Of Daffy Duck Creator|newspaper=The Lone Star Iconocast|date=January 20, 2010|url=http://lonestaricon.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=451|accessdate=February 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he would later utilize for Bugs Bunny in the 1940s. Interested in becoming a newspaper cartoonist, he took a summer course at the [[Chicago Art Institute]].&lt;ref name="Adamson" /&gt;

==Animation career==
On January 1, 1928, Avery arrived in [[Los Angeles]]. He spent the following months working in menial jobs. According to animation historian [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]], these jobs included working in a warehouse, working on the docks at night, loading fruits and vegetables, and painting cars.&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (2003), Warner Bros., pp. unnumbered pages&lt;/ref&gt; He began his animation career when hired by the short-lived Winkler studio (named after producer [[Margaret J. Winkler]]). He was only an [[inker]], inking cels for animated short films in the ''[[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]]'' series. Avery then moved to a new studio, Universal Studio Cartoons (later known as [[Walter Lantz Productions]]). He was again employed as an inker, but moved rapidly up the studio's hierarchy. By 1930, Avery had been promoted to the position of [[animator]].&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (2003), Warner Bros., pp. unnumbered pages&lt;/ref&gt;

Avery at the start of his animation career continued being employed by the [[Walter Lantz Studio]] in the early 1930s. He worked on the majority of the ''Oswald the Lucky Rabbit'' cartoons from 1931 to 1935. He is shown as 'animator' on the original title card credits on the Oswald cartoons. He later claimed to have directed two cartoons during this time.&lt;ref name="Adamson"/&gt;

===Accident to eye===
During some office horseplay at the Lantz studio, a thumbtack or paper clip flew into Avery's left eye and caused him to lose his sight in that eye. Some speculate it was his lack of [[depth perception]] that gave him his unique look at animation and bizarre directorial style,&lt;ref name="Adamson"/&gt; but it did not stop his creative career. The incident is described in some detail by Barrier, based in part on old interviews with Avery. Part of the typical crude horseplay at the Universal studio was using a [[rubber band]] or a paper spitball to target the back of a colleague's head. They would shout "Bull's eye" after every successful shot. An animator called Charles Hastings decided to take the game one step further, by using a wire [[paper clip]] instead. Avery heard one of his colleagues telling him to look out. He reacted by turning around. Instead of the back of his head, the paper clip hit Avery in his left eye. He instantly lost use of his eye.&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (2003), Warner Bros., pp. unnumbered pages&lt;/ref&gt;

===From inker to storyboards===
As an animator, Avery worked under director [[Bill Nolan (animator)|Bill Nolan]]. Nolan reportedly delegated work to Avery, whenever Avery had to animate a sequence. Nolan's instructions for a scene involving Oswald being chased by bees, were reportedly simple. He would describe in which direction Oswald was running ("right to left") and for how many feet. The rest of the details were left up to Avery.&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (2003), Warner Bros., pp. unnumbered pages&lt;/ref&gt; Avery started handing out work to other animators working under Nolan. He still wanted more control over the creative process, and served as a [[de facto]] director for a couple of films. Based on Avery's recollections, there is a description of how this happened. He was submitting [[Visual gag|sight gags]] for use in the short films. Some of them were used in the actual films, and some funny ones were left out. He wanted to somehow get all his gags in the finished film. So he asked Nolan to let him create the entire [[storyboard]] for a film. Nolan instructed Avery to not only draw the storyboard, but to work on the timing and the layout on his own. Avery completed two films using this process. An older Avery recalled that both films "were terrible", though they got accepted for release.&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (2003), Warner Bros., pp. unnumbered pages&lt;/ref&gt;

Avery was reportedly displeased with his salary, and had started giving up on his work. After about six weeks of substandard work, his superiors let him go. In April 1935, Avery lost his job at the Universal studio.

=== "Termite Terrace" ===
Later in 1935, Avery applied for a job at Leon Schlesinger Productions (the company later known as [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]). Avery reportedly managed to convince producer [[Leon Schlesinger]] that he was an experienced director, a false claim. In Avery's own words:
&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (2003), Warner Bros., pp. unnumbered pages&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|quote='Hey, I'm, a director'. Hell! I was no more a director than nothing, but with my loud mouth, I talked him into it.}}

By 1935, when Avery was hired, the Schlesinger studio had only two full-time, regular film directors: [[Friz Freleng]] and [[Jack King (animator)|Jack King]]. Avery became the third regular director.&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (2003), Warner Bros., pp. unnumbered pages&lt;/ref&gt; The staff of the Schlesinger studio had become too large to be housed in a single building, at the [[Warner Bros.]] [[backlot]] in Sunset Boulevard. The new Avery unit of the studio was granted their own building, a five-room [[bungalow]]. The unit staff dubbed their quarters "Termite Terrace", due to its significant [[termite]] population.&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (2003), Warner Bros., pp. unnumbered pages&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asifa-hollywood.org/2005_03_01_blogarch.html International Aminated Film Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808033044/http://www.asifa-hollywood.org/2005_03_01_blogarch.html |date=2007-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Termite Terrace" later became the nickname for the entire Schlesinger/Warners studio, primarily because Avery and his unit were the ones who defined what became known as "the Warner Bros. cartoon."

Avery was granted exclusive use of four animators: [[Bob Clampett]], [[Chuck Jones]], [[Sidney Sutherland|Sid Sutherland]] and [[Virgil Ross]]. The first animated short film produced by this unit was ''[[Gold Diggers of '49]]'' (1935), the third ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' film starring [[Beans (Looney Tunes)|Beans]]. Beans was also featured in the film's title card, signifying that he was the intended [[protagonist]]. The film had a [[Western (genre)|Western]] setting and cast Beans as a [[gold mining|gold miner]]. Also featured in the film was a redesigned [[Porky Pig]], making his second appearance.&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (2003), Warner Bros., pp. unnumbered pages&lt;/ref&gt; The Avery unit, was assigned to work primarily on the black-and-white ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' instead of the [[Technicolor]] ''[[Merrie Melodies]]''.

Avery stopped using Beans following ''Gold Diggers of '49'', but continued using Porky as a star character. According to Michael Barrier, Beans was more of a [[straight man]].&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (2003), Warner Bros., pp. unnumbered pages&lt;/ref&gt; However, Porky had to be redesigned again. The early Porky was decidedly "piglike" in appearance. In Michael Barrier's description: Porky was very fat, had small eyes, a large snout, and pronounced jowls. He was like a porcine version of [[Roscoe Arbuckle]]. Starting with ''[[Porky the Rainmaker]]'' (1936), his fourth animated short starring Porky, Avery introduced a cuter version of Porky. The new design gave Porky more prominent eyes, and a smaller snout. The jowls were replaced by chubby cheeks. Porky's body now had a rounder shape; its defining trait was not fatness but softness.&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (2003), Warner Bros., pp. unnumbered pages&lt;/ref&gt; Barrier notes that the new design by Avery departed from the "Disneyish" [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in the previous drawing style. Porky became a less-realistic pig and looked more like a cartoon character.&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (2003), Warner Bros., pp. unnumbered pages&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Martha Sigall]], Avery was one of the few directors to visit the ink and paint department - she avers that he liked to see how his cartoons were turning out. He would answer questions and was always in good humor. When some of the artists humorously criticized the wild action in his animated shorts, Avery would take time to explain his rationale.&lt;ref name="Sigall"&gt;Sigall (2005), p. 48-49&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled that while working at Warner Bros., the animators had a great deal of liberty, and were subject to very little censorship of their work.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Cohen (2004), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation of Looney Tunes stars===
{{essay-like|date=June 2015}}
Avery, with the assistance of Clampett, Jones, and the new associate director [[Frank Tashlin]], laid the foundation for a style of animation that dethroned [[The Walt Disney Company|The Walt Disney Studio]] as the leader in animated short films, and created a legion of cartoon characters still known today. Avery in particular was deeply involved. He crafted gags for the shorts, periodically provided voices for them (including his trademark belly laugh), and held such control over the timing of the shorts that he would add or cut frames out of the final negative if he felt a gag's timing was not quite right.

''[[Porky's Duck Hunt]]'' introduced the character of [[Daffy Duck]], who possessed a new form of "lunacy" and zaniness that had not been seen before in animated cartoons. Daffy was an almost completely out-of-control "darn fool duck" who frequently bounced around the film frame in double-speed, screaming "Hoo-hoo! hoo-hoo" in a high-pitched, sped-up voice provided by the voice artist [[Mel Blanc]], who, with this cartoon, also took over providing the voice of [[Porky Pig]]. Avery directed two more Daffy Duck cartoons: ''[[Daffy Duck &amp; Egghead]]'' and ''[[Daffy Duck in Hollywood]]''. Egghead was a character inspired by comedian [[Joe Penner]] which would evolve into [[Elmer Fudd]] and first appeared in Avery's ''[[Egghead Rides Again]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=diKnDBs0wrIC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=%22egghead+rides+again%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22egghead%20rides%20again%22&amp;f=false|title=Living Life Inside the Lines|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2014|isbn=9781578067497|last1=Sigall|first1=Martha|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Hardaway]], [[Cal Dalton]] and Chuck Jones directed a series of shorts which featured a Daffy Duck-like rabbit, created by Ben "Bugs" Hardaway. As is the case with most directors, each puts his own personal stamp on the characters, stories and overall feel of a short. So each of these cartoons treated the rabbit differently. The next to try out the rabbit, known around Termite Terrace as "Bugs's bunny" (named after Hardaway), was Avery. Since the recycling of storylines among the directors was commonplace, "[[A Wild Hare]]" was a double throwback. Avery had directed the '37 short, "Porky's Duck Hunt" featuring Porky Pig which introduced "Daffy Duck."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=diKnDBs0wrIC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=%22porky%27s+duck+hunt%22+%2B+daffy+%2B+avery+%2B+first#v=onepage&amp;q=%22porky's%20duck%20hunt%22%20%2B%20daffy%20%2B%20avery%20%2B%20first&amp;f=false|title=Living Life Inside the Lines|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2014|isbn=9781578067497|last1=Sigall|first1=Martha|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardaway remade this as "Porky's Hare Hunt" introducing the rabbit. So Avery went back to the "hunter and prey" framework, and incorporating Jones' "Elmer's Candid Camera", gag for gag, and altering the design of Elmer Fudd. Polishing the timing, and expanding the Groucho Marx smart-aleck attitude already present in "Porky's Hare Hunt", making Bugs a kind of Brooklyn-esque super-cool rabbit who was always in control of the situation and who ran rings around his opponents. Avery has stated that it was very common to refer to folks in Texas as "doc", much like "pal", "dude" or "bud". In ''A Wild Hare'', Bugs adopts this colloquialism when he casually walks up to Elmer, who is "hunting wabbits" and while carefully inspecting a rabbit hole, shotgun in hand, the first words out of Bugs's mouth is a coolly calm, "What's up, doc?" Audiences reacted riotously to the juxtaposition of Bugs's nonchalance and the potentially dangerous situation, and "What's up, doc?" instantly became the rabbit's [[catchphrase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVShFCjVzvIC&amp;pg=PA7 |title=Who's who in Animated Cartoons|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2014|isbn=9781557836717|last1=Lenburg|first1=Jeff|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avery ended up directing only four Bugs Bunny cartoons: ''A Wild Hare'', ''[[Tortoise Beats Hare]]'', ''[[All This and Rabbit Stew]]'', and ''[[The Heckling Hare]]''. During this period, he also directed a number of one-shot shorts, including [[travelogue (films)|travelogue]] [[parody|parodies]] (''[[The Isle of Pingo Pongo]]''), fractured [[fairy-tale]]s (''The Bear's Tale''), Hollywood caricature films (''Hollywood Steps Out''), and cartoons featuring Bugs Bunny clones (''The Crack-Pot Quail'').&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Animated Short Films: A Critical Index to Theatrical Cartoons|author=Borowiec, P.|date=1998|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810835030|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFs5evuicXwC|page=47|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avery's tenure at the Schlesinger studio ended in late 1941, when he and the producer quarreled over the ending to ''The Heckling Hare''. In Avery's original version, Bugs and the hunting dog were to fall off a cliff ''three times'', milking the gag to its comic extreme. According to a DVD commentary for the cartoon, the historian and animator [[Greg Ford]] explained that the problem Schlesinger had with the ending was that, just before falling off the third time, Bugs and the dog were to turn to the screen, with Bugs saying "Hold on to your hats, folks, here we go again!", a punchline to a potentially risqué joke of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vsZYihpCoHMC&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;vq=the+mountaineer+and+his+wife&amp;pg=PA59#v=snippet&amp;q=%22the%20mountaineer%20and%20his%20wife%22&amp;f=false |title=Rationale of the Dirty Joke: An Analysis of Sexual Humor - G. Legman - Google Books |date= 2007-11-01|accessdate=2018-03-14|isbn=9781416595731 |last1=Legman |first1=G. }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported on the quarrel on April 2, 1941. Avery was slapped with a four-week, unpaid suspension.&lt;ref name="Cohen2"&gt;Cohen (2004), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speaking of Animals===
While at Schlesinger, Avery created a concept of animating lip movement to live action footage of animals. Schlesinger was not interested in Avery's idea, so Avery approached [[Jerry Fairbanks]], a friend of his who produced the ''Unusual Occupations'' series of [[short film|short subjects]] for [[Paramount Pictures]]. Fairbanks liked the idea and the ''[[Speaking of Animals and Their Families|Speaking of Animals]]'' series of shorts was launched. When Avery left Warner, he went straight to Paramount to work on the first three shorts in the series before joining [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. The series continued without him, lasting seven years.&lt;ref name="Sigall"&gt;Sigall (2005), p. 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Avery at MGM ===
[[File:Jerky Turkey (1945).ogv|thumb|thumbtime=8|300px|[[Jerky Turkey]] (1945)]]
On September 2, 1941, the ''Reporter'' announced that Avery had signed a five-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where he was to form his own animation unit and direct shorts in [[Technicolor]].&lt;ref name="Cohen2"&gt;Cohen (2004), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; By 1942, Avery was in the employ of MGM, working in their [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|cartoon division]] under the supervision of [[Fred Quimby]]. Avery felt that Schlesinger had stifled him. When asked if he missed the Looney Tunes characters, he responded: "Sometimes, but I don't miss anything else. MGM is a heck of better place to work, in every way, and the people here are just as great."&lt;ref name="Sigall"&gt;Sigall (2005), p. 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

At MGM, Avery's creativity reached its peak. His cartoons became known for their sheer lunacy, breakneck pace, and a penchant for playing with the medium of animation and film in general that few other directors dared to approach. MGM also offered him larger budgets and a higher quality production level than the Warners studio; plus, his unit was filled with talented ex-Disney artists such as [[Preston Blair]] and Ed Love. These changes were evident in Avery's first short released by MGM, ''[[The Blitz Wolf]]'', an [[Adolf Hitler]] parody which was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons)]] in 1942. Avery's cartoons at MGM somewhat felt like [[Looney Tunes]] and [[Merrie Melodies]] cartoons done during that same period at [[Warner Bros.]], two cartoon series which Avery himself had worked on back then, albeit the Warners' series gained more popularity than Avery's MGM cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FWdVCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT9&amp;dq=avery+%2B+warner+%2B+mgm+%2B+popular#v=onepage&amp;q=avery%20%2B%20warner%20%2B%20mgm%20%2B%20popular&amp;f=false |title=Cartoon Carnival: A Critical Guide to the Best Cartoons from Warner Brothers ... - Michael Samerdyke - Google Books |date=2014-08-28 |accessdate=2018-03-14|isbn=9781312470071 |last1=Samerdyke |first1=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avery's best known MGM character debuted in ''[[Dumb-Hounded]]'' (1943). [[Droopy]] (originally "Happy Hound") was a small, calm, slow-moving and slow-talking dog who always won out in the end, whatever difficulties he was presented with. He also created a series of risqué cartoons, beginning with ''[[Red Hot Riding Hood]]'' (also 1943), featuring a sexy female star who never had a set name but has been unofficially referred to as "Red" by fans. Her visual design and voice varied somewhat between shorts. Other Avery characters at MGM included [[Screwy Squirrel]] and the ''[[Of Mice and Men]]''-inspired duo of [[George and Junior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=27iJCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=avery+%2B+%22mice+and+men%22%2B+%22george+and+junior%22#v=onepage&amp;q=avery%20%2B%20%22mice%20and%20men%22%2B%20%22george%20and%20junior%22&amp;f=false |title=Film Cartoons: A Guide to 20th Century American Animated Features and Shorts - Douglas L. McCall - Google Books |date= 2005-01-01|accessdate=2018-03-14|isbn=9780786424504 |last1=McCall |first1=Douglas L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other MGM cartoons directed by Avery include ''[[Bad Luck Blackie]]'', ''[[Cellbound]]'', ''[[Magical Maestro]]'', ''Lucky Ducky'', ''[[Ventriloquist Cat]]'' and ''[[King-Size Canary]]''. Avery began his stint at MGM working with lush colors and realistic backgrounds, but he slowly abandoned this style for a more frenetic, less realistic approach. The newer, more stylized look reflected the influence of the up-and-coming [[United Productions of America|UPA]] studio, the need to cut costs as budgets grew higher, and Avery's own desire to leave reality behind and make cartoons that were not tied to the real world of live action. During this period, he made a series of films which explored the [[technology]] of the future: ''The House of Tomorrow'', ''The Car of Tomorrow'', ''The Farm of Tomorrow'' and ''TV of Tomorrow'' (spoofing common live-action promotional shorts of the time). He also introduced a slow-talking [[wolf]] character, who was the prototype for MGM associates [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s [[Huckleberry Hound]] character, right down to the voice by [[Daws Butler]]. {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Avery took a year's sabbatical from MGM beginning in 1950 (to recover from overwork), during which time [[Dick Lundy (animator)|Dick Lundy]], recently arrived from the Walter Lantz studio, took over his unit and made one ''Droopy'' cartoon, as well as a string of shorts with an old character, [[Barney Bear]]. Avery returned to MGM in October 1951 and began working again. Avery's last two original cartoons for MGM were ''Deputy Droopy'' and ''Cellbound'', completed in 1953 and released in 1955. They were co-directed by the Avery unit animator [[Michael Lah]]. Lah began directing a handful of [[CinemaScope]] Droopy shorts on his own. A burnt-out Avery left MGM in 1953 to return to the Walter Lantz studio. {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Post-MGM work===
Avery's return to the Lantz studio did not last long. He directed four cartoons in 1954–1955: the shorts ''[[Crazy Mixed Up Pup]]'', ''[[Sh-h-h-h-h-h]], [[I'm Cold]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Rockabye Point]]'', in which he defined the character of [[Chilly Willy]] the [[penguin]]. Although ''The Legend of Rockabye Point'' and ''Crazy Mixed Up Pup'' were nominated for [[Academy Awards]], Avery left Lantz over a salary dispute, effectively ending his career in theatrical animation.&lt;ref name="Cartoon Research:Tex Avery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/tex-avery-chills-and-thrills-1955/|title=Tex Avery Chills &amp; Thrills|accessdate=January 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, he left three new Chilly Willy storyboards which would later be made into cartoons by [[Alex Lovy]].

He turned to animated [[television advertisement|television commercials]], including the [[Raid (insecticide)|Raid]] ones of the 1960s and 1970s, in which cartoon insects, confronted by the bug killer, screamed "RAID!" and died flamboyantly, and [[Frito-Lay]]'s controversial [[mascot]], the [[Frito Bandito]]. Avery also produced ads for [[Kool-Aid]] fruit drinks starring the Looney Tunes characters he had once helped create during his Termite Terrace days. During the 1960s and 1970s, Avery became increasingly reserved and [[clinical depression|depressed]],{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} although he continued to draw respect from his peers. His final employer was [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]], where he wrote gags for [[Saturday morning cartoons]] such as the Droopy-esque ''[[The Kwicky Koala Show|Kwicky Koala]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Personal life==
Two days after being fired from Universal In spring 1935, Avery married his girlfriend. She was also employed at the Universal studio, as an inker.&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (2003), Warner Bros., pp. unnumbered pages&lt;/ref&gt; The newlyweds spent a long honeymoon in [[Oregon]], but had to return to Los Angeles when they ran out of money.&lt;ref name="Barrier"&gt;Barrier (2003), Warner Bros., pp. unnumbered pages&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On Tuesday, August 26, 1980, Avery died of lung cancer at [[Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center|St. Joseph's Hospital]] in [[Burbank, California]] at age 72. He is buried in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery]].

&lt;!-- Please don't add more works influenced by Avery unless you have references. Thanks. --&gt;
Avery's influence can be seen in modern cartoons such as ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'', and ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20181031174253/https://nickelodeonanimation-viacom.icims.com/jobs/9077/storyboard-artist-(spongebob-squarepants)/job?ss=1&amp;mode=job&amp;iis=Job+Board&amp;iisn=Glassdoor&amp;mobile=true&amp;width=414&amp;height=716&amp;bga=true&amp;needsRedirect=false&amp;jan1offset=-360&amp;jun1offset=-300 | title=Jobs - Nickelodeon Animation Studio - STORYBOARD ARTIST (SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS)}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Averyesque cowboy character bore his name in the otherwise unrelated series ''[[The Wacky World of Tex Avery]]''. Avery's work has been featured on shows such as ''[[The Tex Avery Show]]'' and ''[[Cartoon Alley]]''. {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In the mid 1990s, [[Dark Horse Comics]] released a trio of three-issue miniseries that were openly labelled tributes to Avery's MGM cartoons, ''Wolf &amp; Red'', ''Droopy'' and ''Screwy Squirrel''. It should also be noted that Tex Avery, unlike most Warner Brothers directors, kept many original title frames of his cartoons, several otherwise lost due to [[Merrie Melodies#Blue Ribbon Merrie Melodies|Blue Ribbon Reissues]]. Rare prints and art containing original titles and unedited animation from Avery's MGM and Warner Bros. cartoons are now usually sold on eBay or in the collections of animators and cartoon enthusiasts. In 2008, [[France]] issued three postage stamps honoring Tex Avery for his 100th birthday, depicting Droopy, [[Red (Tex Avery)|the redheaded showgirl]], and the wolf.&lt;ref&gt;Stamps issued by France on March 3, 2008, memorializing Tex Avery's creative work, series FRO20-08, [http://www.wnsstamps.post/en/stamps?search%5Blike%5D=FR020.08 Universal Postal Union data base.]&lt;/ref&gt;

All of his MGM shorts were released in a North American MGM/UA laserdisc set called ''The Compleat&lt;!-- Compleat is the correct spelling --&gt; Tex Avery''. While two cartoons on the set were edited versions, these being the blackface gags in ''Droopy's Good Deed'' and ''Garden Gopher'', others, including the controversial ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabana]]'' and ''Half-Pint Pygmy'' were included intact (although these were removed from the Region 2 DVD release, now out of print). Several of his cartoons were released on VHS, in four volumes of ''Tex Avery's Screwball Classics'', two vhs [[Droopy]] collections, and various inclusions on MGM animation collection releases, with many gags edited out for television showings left in.

Avery's Droopy cartoons are available on the DVD set ''Tex Avery's Droopy: The Complete Theatrical Collection''.&lt;ref name="dvd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whv.warnerbros.com/WHVPORTAL/Portal/product.jsp?OID=19030|title=Warner Home Video product information for ''Tex Avery's Droopy: The Complete Theatrical Collection (DVD)''|publisher=WarnerHomevideo.com|accessdate=June 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seven Droopy cartoons produced in CinemaScope were included here in their original widescreen versions (albeit [[Letterboxing (filming)|letter-boxed]]), instead of the [[pan and scan]] versions regularly broadcast on television.

Also, some of his works could be found on home video releases (from VHS to Blu-ray) of Warner Bros.' ''Merrie Melodies'' and ''Looney Tunes'' shorts, and the same is true of his few Lantz Studio cartoons included in the DVD set ''[[The Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection]]''.&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Woodpecker-Friends-Classic-Cartoon-Collection/dp/B000PC1PAW |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504061730/http://www.amazon.com/Woodpecker-Friends-Classic-Cartoon-Collection/dp/B000PC1PAW |archivedate=2007-05-04 |dead-url=yes |title=Amazon.com: The Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection: Mel Blanc, Walter Lantz, Tex Avery: Movies &amp;amp; TV |accessdate=October 10, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anime]] director [[Masaaki Yuasa]] has mentioned Tex Avery's work as one of his main influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catsuka.com/news/2008-01-11/event-yuasa-en-france-infos-plus-plus-|title=[Event] Yuasa en france : infos++ - News {{!}} Catsuka|website=www.catsuka.com|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Films directed or co-directed by Tex Avery==
{{Main article|List of films directed by Tex Avery}}
Avery's career as director begins reputedly during his employ at [[Walter Lantz Productions]] in the early 1930s, a spell in which he claims to have directed two animations. His directing credits span the time from his tenure at [[Warner Brothers Animation|Warner Bros.]], to his creative peak at [[MGM Cartoons|MGM]], and finally his return to [[Walter Lantz Productions|Walter Lantz studios]] (although after this short-lived period Avery turned to directing some well-known and notable advertisements). {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

'''''The Second of May 1808''''', also known as '''''The Charge of the Mamelukes''''' (in Spanish: ''El 2 de mayo de 1808 en Madrid'', or ''La lucha con los mamelucos'' or ''La carga de los mamelucos''&lt;ref&gt; {{es}} [http://www.museodelprado.es/coleccion/galeria-on-line/galeria-on-line/obra/el-2-de-mayo-de-1808-en-madrid-la-lucha-con-los-mamelucos/ Online Gallery] [[Prado Museum]]. Retrieved 7 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;), is a painting by the Spanish painter [[Francisco Goya]]. It is a companion to the painting ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'' and is set in the [[Calle de Alcalá]] near [[Puerta del Sol]], [[Madrid]], during the [[Dos de Mayo Uprising]]. It depicts one of the many people's rebellions against the French occupation of [[Spain]] that sparked the [[Peninsular War]].

Both paintings were completed in a two-month time frame in 1814. Today they are displayed in Madrid's [[Museo del Prado]].

==Background==

Goya witnessed first-hand the French occupation of Spain in 1808, when [[Napoleon]] used the pretext of reinforcing his army in [[Portugal]] to seize the Spanish throne, leaving his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] in power. Attempts to remove members of the Spanish royal family from [[Madrid]] provoked a widespread rebellion. This popular uprising occurred between the second and third of May 1808, when suppressed by forces under Maréchal [[Joachim Murat]].

==The painting==
''The Second of May 1808'' depicts the beginning of the uprising when the [[Mamelukes of the Imperial Guard|Mamelukes of the French Imperial Guard]] are ordered to charge and subdue the rioting citizens. The crowd sees the Mamelukes as [[Moors]], provoking an angry response. Instead of dispersing, the crowd turned on the charging Mamelukes, resulting in a ferocious [[melee]].

Goya was probably not present during the actual Charge of the Mamelukes. His supposed presence was first suggested in a book published 40 years after his death, reporting on conversations the author claimed to have had with Goya's gardener.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} His paintings were commissioned in 1814, after the expulsion of Napoleon's army from Spain, by the council governing Spain until the return of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]]. He chose to portray the citizens of Madrid as unknown heroes using the crudest of weapons, such as knives, to attack a professional, occupying army. That did not please the king when he returned, so the paintings were not hung publicly until many years (and governments) later.

Goya chose not to paint any single action or to have any single focal point to emphasize the chaos of the drama.

==Influences==
[[File:Ivryrubens.jpg|thumb|''[[Henry IV at the Battle of Ivry]]'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] ([[Uffizi]])]]
Goya's ''[[Saturn Devouring His Son]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;1819&amp;ndash;1823 suggests a familiarity with Rubens' 1636 in the Prado. Kenneth Clark considered ''The Second of May 1808'' an "artistic failure&amp;nbsp;... perhaps he could not shake off the memory of similar compositions by Rubens".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;Clark,K. ''Looking at Pictures" 1960, p.127 (apparently on p.&amp;nbsp;127. of 1968 printing)&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether or not he knew copies of the [[The Tiger Hunt|hunts]] and [[The Battle of the Amazons (Rubens)|battles]] [[Alte Pinakothek|in Munich]], at least one original, the ''Battle of Ivry'', was along Goya's Italian itinerary.

==Damage==
In 1936, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], when Madrid was bombed by Nationalist troops, the [[Second Spanish Republic|republican]] government  decided to evacuate the paintings from the [[Museo del Prado|Prado]]. A truck carrying Goya's paintings had an accident, and ''The Second of May'' was badly damaged: there were tears and even pieces missing.

A first restoration was carried out in 1941 when the paintings returned to Madrid. A further restoration was completed between 2007 and 2008.

'''''The Vale of Dedham''''' is an 1828 oil painting by the English painter [[John Constable]] which depicts [[Dedham Vale]] on the Essex-Suffolk border in eastern England. It is in the permanent collection of the [[National Galleries of Scotland]], Edinburgh. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/4766/vale-dedham|title=John Constable - The Vale of Dedham|publisher=National Galleries of Scotland |accessdate= 27 November 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The view from Gun Hill along the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]] to Dedham village and the distant Stour estuary was a favourite subject of Constable which he painted several times, most noticeably the 1802 version in the [[Victoria  and Albert Museum]].

In this work the paint is thickly applied with touches of white to emphasise the reflection of sunlight. The work was primarily responsible for his admission to the prestigious [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1829.

This fair deliberately distinguished itself by focusing on industry and labour.&lt;ref name="itworldturin" /&gt;

The fair was held in the [[Parco del Valentino]] (as were the three previous Turin fairs in 1884, 1885 and 1902 and the subsequent 1924 Turin fair).&lt;ref name="itworldturin" /&gt;

'''''Wanchojang''''' ({{korean|hangul=완초장}}) is the traditional [[Korea]]n art of creating mats, baskets and boxes from woven [[Cyperaceae|sedge]] (''wancho'').&lt;ref name="Chaedan2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hanʼguk Kukche Kyoryu Chaedan|title=Masters of traditional Korean handicrafts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zxk4AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=12 April 2013|year=2009|publisher=Korea Foundation|isbn=978-89-86090-32-1|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sedge has been a common material for household goods in Korea since the [[Silla|Silla period]] (57 BCE – 935 CE). Despite the availability of the plant, which grows well in the waterlogged soil of rice paddies, sedge products were highly prized and were used as decoration in royal palaces and given as tribute to other nations. A sedge basket known as a ''pyebaek dongguri'' was an important element of the traditional wedding rite, and royal sacrificial ceremonies in the [[Goryeo|Goryeo period]] employed sedge weaving as a religious sacrament.&lt;ref name=koreana&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Min Young|title=Yi Sang-jae Handicrafter of Sedge Masterpieces|url=http://koreana.kf.or.kr/view.asp?article_id=7606|work=Koreana|publisher=Korea Federation|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The process of creating sedge products starts with the farming of the raw material. Sedge is planted in April and harvested only a few months later in the summer. The cut stalks are boiled, dried, soaked, and then dried again in a process that, after several repetitions, bleaches them to a shiny white colour.&lt;ref name=koreana/&gt;&lt;ref name=antique&gt;{{cite web|title=The Artistic Beauty of Grass Weaving|url=http://www.antiquealive.com/masters/m10/master10_view3.html|work=Antique Masters|publisher=Antique Alive|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some strands are dyed to enable coloured highlights and designs in the finished work.&lt;ref name=koreana/&gt;

Two principal methods for weaving the sedge exist: one involving the use of tools or machines, the other performed entirely by hand. These are sometimes referred to as "close" and "sparse" weaving.&lt;ref name=koreana/&gt;&lt;ref name=antique/&gt;&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|title=Handicrafts:Wanchojang|url=http://www.ichcap.org/en/archives/unescoView2.jsp?ich_name=ICH_LIST3_ENG&amp;idx=&amp;listLIDX=113&amp;searchtext=|work=ICH Archives|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machine weaving is predominantly used for making mats, whilst boxes, bowls and baskets require hand weaving. A basic frame (''no'') is created first, comprising interwoven sedge strands; the ''samori'', or vertical sections, are then weaved into this. At this stage, images, patterns and characters are incorporated into the design, in a process called ''tteumjil''.&lt;ref name=koreana/&gt; The process of creation is lengthy, taking up to two weeks for the construction of a hand-made ''sajuham'' ("three-tiered box").&lt;ref name=antique/&gt;

==Yi Sang-jae==
The current master of ''wanchojang'' is Yi Sang-jae from [[Ganghwado]], an area that has long been a site of sedge cultivation and weaving. Born in 1943, he has been working in sedge for over fifty years, and has had his works exhibited in Japan and the UK.&lt;ref name=antique/&gt; Yi, along with the art of ''wanchojang'' itself, was designated in 1996 as an [[Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea|Important Intangible Cultural Asset]].&lt;ref name=koreana/&gt;&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;

'''''Xanthelasma''''' is a sharply demarcated yellowish deposit of cholesterol underneath the skin, usually on or around the [[eyelids]].&lt;ref name="frew"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frew JW, Murrell DF, Haber RM | title = Fifty shades of yellow: a review of the xanthodermatoses | journal = International Journal of Dermatology | volume = 54 | issue = 10 | pages = 1109–23 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26227781 | doi = 10.1111/ijd.12945 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While they are neither harmful to the skin nor [[Pain|painful]], these minor growths may be disfiguring and can be removed.&lt;ref name="frew"/&gt; There is no high-quality evidence that xanthelasma deposits are related to blood [[low-density lipoprotein]] levels or increased risk of [[atherosclerosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ozdöl S, Sahin S, Tokgözoğlu L | title = Xanthelasma palpebrarum and its relation to atherosclerotic risk factors and lipoprotein (a) | journal = International Journal of Dermatology | volume = 47 | issue = 8 | pages = 785–9 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18717856 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-4632.2008.03690.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''xanthelasma'' may be referred to as a ''[[xanthoma]]'' when becoming larger and nodular, assuming tumorous proportions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Shields | first1 = Carol | last2 = Shields | first2 = Jerry | name-list-format = vanc | title=Eyelid, conjunctival and orbital tumors: atlas and textbook |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-7817-7578-7 |oclc= |doi= |access-date=}}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Xanthelasma'' is often classified simply as a subtype of ''xanthoma''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Xanthelasma | work = Mosby's Medical Dictionary |edition=8th |year=2009 |access-date=November 8, 2012 |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/xanthelasma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=November 2017}}

==Treatment==
''Xanthelasmata'' can be removed with a [[trichloroacetic acid]] peel, surgery, [[laser]]s or [[cryotherapy]]. Removal may cause scarring and pigment changes, but it is an uncommon side-effect of treatment. 

== Prognosis ==
Recurrence is common: 40% of patients with XP had recurrence after primary surgical excision, 60% after secondary excision, and 80% when all four eyelids were involved. A possible cause might be insufficiently deep excisions. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nair PA, Singhal R | title = Xanthelasma palpebrarum - a brief review | journal = Clinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology | volume = 11 | pages = 1–5 | date = 2017-12-18 | pmid = 29296091 | pmc = 5739544 | doi = 10.2147/CCID.S130116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
Xanthelasma is a rare disorder in the General population, with a variable incidence of 0.56%–1.5% in western developed countries. The age of onset ranges  ranges from 15 to 75 with a peak in the 4th to 5th decades of life. There also seems to be a greater prevalance in females, but this might be due to higher consciousness to cosmetic defects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jain A, Goyal P, Nigam PK, Gurbaksh H, Sharma RC | title = Xanthelasma Palpebrarum-clinical and biochemical profile in a tertiary care hospital of Delhi | journal = Indian Journal of Clinical Biochemistry | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–3 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 23105704 | pmc = 3453794 | doi = 10.1007/BF02913335 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Etymology==
The word is derived from Greek ''xanthós, [[wikt:ξανθός|ξανθός]] '', "yellow" and ''élasma, έλασμα'', "foil". The plural is ''xanthelasmata''.
