== General specifications ==
AMC 20s have an 8 7/8" ring gear and use a 29 spline axle shaft.

The AMC 20 was most often used with [[V8 engine]]s in cars and [[Jeeps]]. It was also used in the AM General [[Humvee]].

== Ratios ==
There were many ratios offered over the lifetime of the AMC 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=AMC 1977 Technical Service Manual|year=1977|publisher=American Motors Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Letter codes were stamped on the axle to indicate installed gears. AMC changed or reused letter codes during the axle's long life.
There are other gear ratios available in the aftermarket.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13837">An '''anthropologist''' is a person engaged in the practice of [[anthropology]]. Anthropology is the study of various aspects of [[human]]s within past and present [[Society|societies]].&lt;ref name="oed3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/anthropology?q=anthropology|title=anthropology|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eb3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/27505/anthropology|title=anthropology|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aaa3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/whatisanthropology.cfm|title=What is Anthropology?|publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]]|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social anthropology]], [[cultural anthropology]], and [[philosophical anthropology]] study the norms and values of societies. [[Linguistic anthropology]] studies how language affects social life, while [[economic anthropology]] studies human economic behavior. [[Biological anthropology|Biological (physical)]], [[Forensic anthropology|forensic]], and [[medical anthropology]] study the biological development of humans, the application of biological anthropology in a legal setting, and the study of diseases and their impacts on humans over time, respectively.

==Education==
Anthropologists usually cover a breadth of topics within anthropology in their [[undergraduate education]], and then proceed to specialize in topics of their own choice at the [[Postgraduate education|graduate level]]. In some universities, a qualifying exam serves to test both the breadth and depth of a student's understanding of anthropology; the students who pass are permitted to work on a doctoral dissertation.

Anthropologists typically hold graduate degrees, either doctorates or master's degrees. Not holding an advanced degree is rare in the field. Some anthropologists hold undergraduate degrees in other fields than [[anthropology]] and graduate degrees in anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americananthro.org/AdvanceYourCareer/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=1782|title=Career Paths and Education - Advance Your Career|website=www.americananthro.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Historically, anthropologists primarily worked in academic settings; however, by 2014, U.S. anthropologists and [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] were largely employed in research positions (28%), management and consulting (23%), and government positions (27%).&lt;ref&gt;Baba, Marietta L.

Anthropologists without doctorates tend to work more in other fields than [[Academy|academia]], while those while the majority of those with doctorates are primarily employed in academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/02/16/anthropology_master_s_are_most_likely_to_bring_their_discipline_to_the_public|title=Anthropology Without Doctorates|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those without doctorates in academia tend to work exclusively as researchers and do not teach. Those in research-only positions are often not considered faculty. The median salary for anthropologists in 2015 was $62,220.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/anthropologist|title=Anthropologist Ranks Among Best Jobs of 2017|website=money.usnews.com|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many anthropologists report an above average level of job satisfaction.

Although closely related and often grouped with archaeology, anthropologists and [[archeologist]]s perform differing roles, though [[archeology]] is considered a sub-discipline of [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While both professions focus on the study of human culture from past to present, archaeologists focus specifically on analyzing material remains such as artifacts and architectural remains.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.paesta.psu.edu/book/earth-systems-science-introduction/definitions/paleontology-vs-archaeology-vs-anthropology|title=Paleontology vs. Archaeology vs. Anthropology {{!}} PAESTA|website=www.paesta.psu.edu|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropology encompasses a wider range of professions including the rising fields of [[forensic anthropology]], [[digital anthropology]], and [[cyber anthropology]]. The role of an anthropologist differs as well from that of a [[historian]]. While anthropologists focus their studies on humans and human behavior, historians look at events from a broader perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.careerigniter.com/questions/what-is-the-difference-between-a-historian-and-an-anthropologist/|title=What Is The Difference Between A Historian And An Anthropologist? - Career Igniter|website=www.careerigniter.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians also tend to focus less on culture than anthropologists in their studies. A far greater percentage of historians are employed in academic settings than anthropologists, who have more diverse places of employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.historians.org/jobs-and-professional-development/career-diversity-for-historians/career-diversity-resources/where-historians-work-an-interactive-database-of-history-phd-career-outcomes|title=Where Historians Work: An Interactive Database of History PhD Career Outcomes {{!}} AHA|website=www.historians.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists are experiencing a shift in the twenty-first century [[United States]] with the rise of forensic anthropology. In the United States, as opposed to many other countries forensic anthropology falls under the domain of the anthropologist and not the [[Forensic pathologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Traithepchanapai|first=Pongpon|last2=Mahakkanukrauh|first2=Pasuk|last3=Kranioti|first3=Elena F.|date=2016-04-01|title=History, research and practice of forensic anthropology in Thailand|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0379073816300470|journal=Forensic Science International|volume=261|issue=Supplement C|pages=167.e1–167.e6|doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2016.02.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this role, forensic anthropologists help in the identification of skeletal remains by deducing biological characteristics such as [[sex]], [[Ageing|age]], [[Human height|stature]], and [[Ancestor|ancestry]] from the [[skeleton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essentials of forensic anthropology: especially as developed in the United States.|last=Stewart|first=T.D.|publisher=Charles C. Thomas|year=1979|isbn=978-0398038113|location=Springfield, Illinois|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, forensic anthropologists tend to gravitate more toward working in academic and laboratory settings, while forensic pathologists perform more applied field work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.uncw.edu/albertm/forensic.htm|title=UNCW Forensic Anthropology|website=people.uncw.edu|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forensic anthropologists typically hold [[Doctor of Philosophy|academic doctorates]], while forensic pathologists are medical doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.uncw.edu/albertm/forensic.htm|title=UNCW Forensic Anthropology|website=people.uncw.edu|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of forensic anthropology is rapidly evolving with increasingly capable technology and more extensive databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projects.nfstc.org/tech_transition/anthropology/overview.htm|title=Advances in Forensic Anthropology • Technology Transition Workshop at NFSTC|website=projects.nfstc.org|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forensic anthrology is one of the most specialized and competitive job areas within the field of anthropology and currently has more qualified graduates than positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://study.com/articles/Forensic_Anthropologist_Job_Description_Outlook_and_Salary.html|title=Forensic Anthropologist: Job Description, Outlook and Salary|work=Study.com|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The profession of Anthropology has also received an additional sub-field with the rise of [[Digital anthropology]]. This new branch of the profession has an increased usage of [[computer]]s as well as interdisciplinary work with [[medicine]], computer visualization, [[industrial design]], [[biology]], and [[journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/174131450|title=Virtual anthropology : a guide to a new interdisciplinary field|last=1961-|first=Weber, Gerhard W.,|date=2011|publisher=Springer|others=Bookstein, Fred L., 1947-|isbn=9783211486474|location=Wien|oclc=174131450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologists in this field primarily study the evolution of human reciprocal relations with the [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Libin|first=Alexander|last2=Libin|first2=Elena|date=2005|title=Cyber-anthropology: a new study on human and technological co-evolution|journal=Studies in Health Technology and Informatics|volume=118|pages=146–155|issn=0926-9630|pmid=16301776}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyber anthropologists also study digital and [[Cyberethics|cyber ethics]] along with the global implications of increasing connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50279971|title=Ethics and the profession of anthropology : dialogue for ethically conscious practice|date=2002|publisher=AltaMira Press|others=Fluehr-Lobban, Carolyn.|isbn=9780759103375|edition=2nd|location=Walnut Creek|oclc=50279971}}&lt;/ref&gt; With cyber ethical issues such as [[net neutrality]] increasingly coming to light, this sub-field is rapidly gaining more recognition.

The '''argument from reason''' is an argument against [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and for the [[existence of God]] (or at least a [[supernatural]] being that is the source of human reason). The best-known defender of the argument is [[C. S. Lewis]]. Lewis first defended the argument at length in his 1947 book, ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles: A Preliminary Study]]''. In the second edition of ''Miracles'' (1960), Lewis substantially revised and expanded the argument.

Contemporary defenders of the argument from reason include [[Alvin Plantinga]], [[Victor Reppert]] and [[William Harker]].

==The argument==

Methodological naturalism is the view that nature as studied by the natural sciences is all that exists. Naturalists deny the existence of a supernatural God, souls, an afterlife, or anything supernatural. Nothing exists outside or beyond the physical universe.

The argument from reason seeks to show that naturalism is self-refuting, or otherwise false and indefensible.

According to Lewis,

{{blockquote|One absolutely central inconsistency ruins [the naturalistic worldview].... The whole picture professes to depend on inferences from observed facts. Unless inference is valid, the whole picture disappears.... [U]nless Reason is an absolute--all is in ruins. Yet those who ask me to believe this world picture also ask me to believe that Reason is simply the unforeseen and unintended by-product of mindless matter at one stage of its endless and aimless becoming. Here is flat contradiction. They ask me at the same moment to accept a conclusion and to discredit the only testimony on which that conclusion can be based.|sign=C. S. Lewis, "Is Theology Poetry?", ''[[The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses]]''}}

More precisely, Lewis's argument from reason can be stated as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;1. No belief is rationally inferred if it can be fully explained in terms of nonrational causes. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Support: Reasoning requires insight into logical relations. A process of reasoning (P therefore Q) is rational only if the reasoner sees that Q follows from, or is supported by, P, and accepts Q on that basis. Thus, reasoning is trustworthy (or "valid", as Lewis sometimes says) only if it involves a special kind of causality, namely, rational insight into logical implication or evidential support. If a bit of reasoning can be fully explained by nonrational causes, such as fibers firing in the brain or a bump on the head, then the reasoning is not reliable, and cannot yield knowledge. Consider this example: Person A refuses to go near the neighbor’s dog because he had a bad childhood experience with dogs. Person B refuses to go near the neighbor’s dog because one month ago he saw it attack someone. Both have given a reason for staying away from the dog, but person A’s reason is the result of nonrational causes, while person B has given an explanation for his behavior following from rational inference (animals exhibit patterns of behavior; these patterns are likely to be repeated; this dog has exhibited aggression towards someone who approached it; there is a good chance that the dog may exhibit the same behavior towards me if I approach it). Consider a second example: person A says that he is afraid to climb to the 8th story of a bank building because he and humans in general have a natural fear of heights resulting from the processes of evolution and natural selection. He has given an explanation of his fear, but since his fear results from nonrational causes (natural selection), his argument does not follow from logical inference.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
2. If naturalism is true, then all beliefs can be fully explained in terms of nonrational causes. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Support: Naturalism holds that nature is all that exists, and that all events in nature can in principle be explained without invoking supernatural or other nonnatural causes. Standardly, naturalists claim that all events must have physical causes, and that human thoughts can ultimately be explained in terms of material causes or physical events (such as neurochemical events in the brain) that are nonrational.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
3. Therefore, if naturalism is true, then no belief is rationally inferred (from 1 and 2). 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
4. We have good reason to accept naturalism only if it can be rationally inferred from good evidence. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;5. Therefore, there is not, and cannot be, good reason to accept naturalism.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from Victor Reppert, author of ''C.S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea''. Taken from his blog at: http://dangerousidea.blogspot.com/2006/07/argument-from-reason-and-lewiss-post.html"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In short, naturalism undercuts itself. If naturalism is true, then we cannot sensibly believe it or virtually anything else.

In some versions of the argument from reason, Lewis extends the argument to defend a further conclusion: that human reason depends on an eternal, self-existent rational Being (God). This extension of the argument from reason states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Since everything in nature can be wholly explained in terms of nonrational causes, human reason (more precisely, the power of drawing conclusions based solely on the rational cause of logical insight) must have a source outside of nature.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;2. If human reason came from non-reason it would lose all rational credentials and would cease to be reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;3. So, human reason cannot come from non-reason (from 2).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;4. So human reason must come from a source outside nature that is itself rational (from 1 and 3).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;5. This supernatural source of reason may itself be dependent on some further source of reason, but a chain of such dependent sources cannot go on forever. Eventually, we must reason back to the existence of eternal, non-dependent source of human reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;6. Therefore, there exists an eternal, self-existent, rational Being who is the ultimate source of human reason. This Being we call God (from 4-5). (Lewis, ''Miracles'', chap. 4)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticisms==

On 2 February 1948, Oxford philosopher [[Elizabeth Anscombe]] read a paper to the Oxford [[Socratic Club]] criticizing the version of the argument from reason contained in the third chapter of Lewis's ''Miracles''.

Her first criticism was against the use of the word "irrational" by Lewis (Anscombe 1981: 225-26). Her point was that there is an important difference between irrational causes of belief, such as wishful thinking, and nonrational causes, such as neurons firing in the brain, that do not obviously lead to faulty reasoning. Lewis accepted the criticism and amended the argument, basing it on the concept of nonrational causes of belief (as in the version provided in this article).

Anscombe's second criticism questioned the intelligibility of Lewis's intended contrast between "valid" and "invalid" reasoning. She wrote: "What ''can'' you mean by 'valid' beyond what would be indicated by the explanation you would give for distinguishing between valid and invalid, and what in the naturalistic hypothesis prevents that explanation from being given and from meaning what it does?" (Anscombe 1981: 226) Her point is that it makes no sense to contrast "valid" and "invalid" reasoning unless it is possible for some forms of reasoning to be valid. Lewis later conceded (Anscombe 1981: 231) that "valid" was a bad word for what he had in mind. Lewis didn't mean to suggest that if naturalism is true, no arguments can be given in which the conclusions follow logically from the premises. What he meant is that a process of reasoning is "veridical", that is, reliable as a method of pursuing knowledge and truth, only if it cannot be entirely explained by nonrational causes.

Anscombe's third objection was that Lewis failed to distinguish between different senses of the terms "why", "because", and "explanation", and that what counts as a "full" explanation varies by context (Anscombe 1981: 227-31).  In the context of ordinary life, "because he wants a cup of tea" may count as a perfectly satisfactory explanation of why Peter is boiling water. Yet such a purposive explanation would not count as a full explanation (or an explanation at all) in the context of physics or biochemistry. Lewis accepted this criticism, and created a revised version of the argument in which the distinction between "because" in the sense of physical causality, and "because" in the sense of evidential support, became the central point of the argument. (This is the version described in this article.)&lt;ref&gt;For Anscombe's critical appraisal of Lewis's revised argument from reason, see Elizabeth Anscombe, "C. S. Lewis's Rewrite of Chapter III of ''Miracles''", in Roger White, Judith Wolfe, and Brendan N. Wolfe, eds., ''C. S. Lewis and His Circle: Essays and Memoirs from the Oxford C. S. Lewis Society''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2015, pp. 15-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent critics have argued that Lewis's argument at best refutes only strict forms of naturalism that seek to explain everything in terms ultimately reducible to physics or purely mechanistic causes.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., David Kyle Johnson, "Con: Naturalism Undefeated," in Gregory Bassham, ed. ''C. S. Lewis's Christian Apologetics: Pro and Con''. Leiden: Brill Rodopi, 2015, pp. 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt; So-called "broad" naturalists that see consciousness as an "emergent" non-physical property of complex brains would agree with Lewis that different levels or types of causation exist in nature, and that rational inferences are not fully explainable by nonrational causes.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Charles Taliaferro, "On Naturalism," in Robert MacSwain and Michael Wards, eds. ''The Cambridge Companion to C. S. Lewis''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics have objected that Lewis's argument from reason fails because the causal origins of beliefs are often irrelevant to whether those beliefs are rational, justified, warranted, etc. Anscombe, for example, argues that "if a man has reasons, and they are good reasons, and they are genuinely his reasons, for thinking something—then his thought is rational, whatever causal statements we make about him" (Anscombe 1981: 229). On many widely accepted theories of knowledge and justification, questions of how beliefs were ultimately caused (e.g., at the level of brain neurochemistry) are viewed as irrelevant to whether those beliefs are rational or justified. Some defenders of Lewis claim that this objection misses the mark, because his argument is directed at what he calls the "veridicalness" of acts of reasoning (i.e., whether reasoning connects us with objective reality or truth), rather than with whether any inferred beliefs can be rational or justified in a materialistic world.

==Similar views by other thinkers==
Philosophers such as [[Victor Reppert]],&lt;ref&gt;Victor Reppert, ''C. S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea: In Defense of the Argument from'' ''Reason''. Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2003; Victor Reppert, "The Argument from Reason Defended," in Gregory Bassham, ed., ''C. S. Lewis's Christian Apologetics: Pro and Con''. Leiden: Brill Rodopi, 2015, pp. 75-89.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Hasker]]&lt;ref&gt;William Hasker, ''The Emergent Self''. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1999, chap. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alvin Plantinga]]&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Plantinga, ''Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and Naturalism''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2011, chap. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; have expanded on the argument from reason, and credit C.S. Lewis as an important influence on their thinking.

Lewis never claimed that he invented the argument from reason; in fact, he refers to it as a "venerable philosophical chestnut."&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, ''Collected Letters'', vol. 2, Walter Hooper ed. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 2004, p. 715.&lt;/ref&gt; Early versions of the argument occur in the works of Arthur Balfour (see, e.g., ''The Foundations of Belief'', 1879, chap. 13) and G.K. Chesterton. In Chesterton's 1908 book ''Orthodoxy'', in a chapter titled "The Suicide of Thought", he writes of the "great and possible peril . . . that the human intellect is free to destroy itself....It is idle to talk always of the alternative of reason and faith. It is an act of faith to assert that our thoughts have any relation to reality at all. If you are merely a sceptic, you must sooner or later ask yourself the question, "Why should anything go right; even observation and deduction? Why should not good logic be as misleading as bad logic? They are both movements in the brain of a bewildered ape?"&lt;ref&gt;G. K. Chesterton, ''Orthodoxy''. New York: Iamge Books, 1959, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Chesterton asserts that the argument is a fundamental, if unstated, tenet of Thomism in his 1933 book ''St. Thomas Aquinas: "The Dumb Ox"'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, even those who appreciate the metaphysical depth of Thomism in other matters have expressed surprise that he does not deal at all with what many now think the main metaphysical question; whether we can prove that the primary act of recognition of any reality is real. The answer is that St. Thomas recognised instantly, what so many modern sceptics have begun to suspect rather laboriously; that a man must either answer that question in the affirmative, or else never answer any question, never ask any question, never even exist intellectually, to answer or to ask. I suppose it is true in a sense that a man can be a fundamental sceptic, but he cannot be anything else: certainly not even a defender of fundamental scepticism. If a man feels that all the movements of his own mind are meaningless, then his mind is meaningless, and he is meaningless; and it does not mean anything to attempt to discover his meaning. Most fundamental sceptics appear to survive, because they are not consistently sceptical and not at all fundamental. They will first deny everything and then admit something, if for the sake of argument--or often rather of attack without argument. I saw an almost startling example of this essential frivolity in a professor of final scepticism, in a paper the other day. A man wrote to say that he accepted nothing but Solipsism, and added that he had often wondered it was not a more common philosophy. Now Solipsism simply means that a man believes in his own existence, but not in anybody or anything else. And it never struck this simple sophist, that if his philosophy was true, there obviously were no other philosophers to profess it.&lt;ref&gt;G. K. Chesterton, ''Thomas Aquinas: The Dumb Ox''. New York: Image Books, 1933, pp. 148-49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''Miracles'', Lewis himself quotes J. B. S. Haldane, who appeals to a similar line of reasoning in his 1927 book, ''Possible Worlds'': "If my mental processes are determined wholly by the motions of atoms in my brain, I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true ... and hence I have no reason for supposing my brain to be composed of atoms."&lt;ref&gt;J. B. S. Haldane, ''Possible Worlds and Other Essays''. London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1929, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other versions of the argument from reason occur in [[C.E.M. Joad]]'s ''Guide to Modern Philosophy'' (London: Faber, 1933, pp.&amp;nbsp;58–59), Richard Taylor's ''Metaphysics'' (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 3rd ed., 1983, pp.&amp;nbsp;104–05), and [[J. P. Moreland]]'s ''Scaling the Secular City: A Defense of Christianity'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 1987, chap. 3).

'''Art Deco''', sometimes referred to as '''Deco''', is a style of visual arts, architecture and design that first appeared in France just before [[World War I]].{{Sfn|Texier|2012|page=128}} Art Deco influenced the design of buildings, furniture, jewelry, fashion, cars, movie theatres, trains, ocean liners, and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners.{{Sfn|Hillier|1968|page=12}} It took its name, short for ''Arts Décoratifs'', from the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts|Exposition internationale des arts décoratifs et industriels modernes]] (International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts) held in Paris in 1925.{{Sfn|Benton|Benton|Wood|Baddeley|2003|page=16}} It combined [[Modernism|modernist]] styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials. During its heyday, Art Deco represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress.

Art Deco was a pastiche of many different styles, sometimes contradictory, united by a desire to be modern. From its outset, Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of [[Cubism]]; the bright colors of [[Fauvism]] and of the [[Ballets Russes]]; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of [[Louis Philippe I]] and [[Louis XVI]]; and the exotic styles of [[Chinese art|China]] and [[Japanese art|Japan]], [[Indian art|India]], [[Persian art|Persia]], [[Art of ancient Egypt|ancient Egypt]] and [[ancient Maya art|Maya art]]. It featured rare and expensive materials, such as ebony and ivory, and exquisite craftsmanship. The [[Chrysler Building]] and other skyscrapers of New York built during the 1920s and 1930s are monuments of the Art Deco style.

In the 1930s, during the [[Great Depression]], the Art Deco style became more subdued. New materials arrived, including [[chrome plating]], [[stainless steel]], and [[plastic]]. A sleeker form of the style, called [[Streamline Moderne]], appeared in the 1930s; it featured curving forms and smooth, polished surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Renaut, Christophe and Lazé, Christophe, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'' (2006), Editions Jean-Paul Gisserot, pages 110–116&lt;/ref&gt; Art Deco is one of the first truly international styles, but its dominance ended with the beginning of World War II and the rise of the strictly functional and unadorned styles of [[modernism]] and the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] of architecture that followed.{{Sfn|Benton, Benton and Wood|''Art Déco (1910–1939)''|2010|pages=13–28}}

==Naming==
Art Deco took its name, short for ''Arts Décoratifs'', from the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes]] held in Paris in 1925,{{Sfn|Benton|Benton|Wood|Baddeley|2003|page=16}} though the diverse styles that characterize Art Deco had already appeared in Paris and [[Brussels]] before World War I.

The term ''arts décoratifs'' was first used in France in 1858; published in the Bulletin de la Société française de photographie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k111368q "M. Cunny présente une Note sur un procédé vitro-héliographique applicable aux arts décoratifs", ''Bulletin de la Société française de photographie'', Société française de photographie. Éditeur: Société française de photographie (Paris), 1858], Bibliothèque nationale de France, département Sciences et techniques, 8-V-1012, Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, ''Le Figaro'' newspaper used the term ''objets d'art décoratifs'' with respect to objects for stage scenery created for the [[Salle Le Peletier|Théâtre de l'Opéra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2716231 "Enfin, dans les ateliers, on travaille à l'achèvement des objets d'art décoratifs, qui sont très nombreux", Le Figaro, Éditeur: Figaro (Paris), 1869-09-18, no. 260], Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65463131 ''L'Art décoratif à Limoges'', La Voix de la province : Revue littéraire, artistique, agricole et commerciale, 1862], (1862/04/01 (N1)-1863/01/01 (N12)), Bibliothèque francophone multimédia de Limoges, 2013-220524, Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb32858171s/date Revue des arts décoratifs (Paris), 1880-1902], Bibliothèque nationale de France, département Sciences et techniques, 4-V-1113&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, furniture designers, textile, jewelry and glass designers, and other craftsmen were officially given the status of artists by the French government. In response to this, the ''École royale gratuite de dessin'' (Royal Free School of Design) founded in 1766 under King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] to train artists and artisans in crafts relating to the fine arts, was renamed the National School of Decorative Arts (''[[École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs|l'École nationale des arts décoratifs]]''). It took its present name of ENSAD (''École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs'') in 1927.

During the 1925 Exposition the architect [[Le Corbusier]] wrote a series of articles about the exhibition for his magazine ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' under the title, "1925 EXPO. ARTS. DÉCO." which were combined into a book, "L'art décoratif d'aujourd'hui" (Decorative Art Today). The book was a spirited attack on the excesses of the colorful and lavish objects at the Exposition; and on the idea that practical objects such as furniture should have any decoration at all; his conclusion was that "Modern decoration has no decoration".{{Sfn|Le Corbusier, ''L'Art décoratif d'aujourd'hui'',|Éditions Crès, Collection de "L'Esprit Nouveau", Paris, 1925|page=70-81}}

The actual phrase "Art déco" did not appear in print until 1966, when it featured in the title of the first modern exhibit on the subject, called ''Les Années 25 : Art déco, Bauhaus, Stijl, Esprit nouveau'', which covered the variety of major styles in the 1920s and 1930s. The term Art déco was then used in a 1966 newspaper article by Hillary Gelson in the Times (London, 12 November), describing the different styles at the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gwYZBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=the+term+art+deco+was+used+in+1966&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=evwzNMwV_h&amp;sig=V0-rrXusNYbSq3eS4oRIs08IPNU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiujouFzozPAhWFzRQKHTvSDFEQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20term%20art%20deco%20was%20used%20in%201966&amp;f=false David Raizman, Carma Gorman, ''Objects, Audiences, and Literatures: Alternative Narratives in the History of Design'', Cambridge Scholars Publishing, Mar 26, 2009], {{ISBN|1443809462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0kf0AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=the+term+art+deco+was+used+in+1966&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FB0v14BG_y&amp;sig=R0aY_wYIx8EiSds5HUXQsH0S5Xo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiujouFzozPAhWFzRQKHTvSDFEQ6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20term%20art%20deco%20was%20used%20in%201966&amp;f=false Richard Poulin, ''Graphic Design and Architecture, A 20th Century History: A Guide to Type, Image, Symbol, and Visual Storytelling in the Modern World'', Rockport Publishers, 2012], {{ISBN|1610586336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Deco gained currency as a broadly applied stylistic label in 1968 when historian [[Bevis Hillier]] published the first major academic book on the style: ''[[Art Deco of the 20s and 30s]]''.{{Sfn|Hillier|1968|page=12}} Hillier noted that the term was already being used by art dealers and cites ''The Times'' (2 November 1966) and an essay named "Les Arts Déco" in ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' magazine (November 1967) as examples of prior usage.{{Sfn|Benton|Benton|Wood|Baddeley|2003|page=430}} In 1971, Hillier organized an exhibition at the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]], which he details in his book about it, ''The World of Art Deco''.&lt;ref name="Hillier4"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hillier | first= Bevis | title=The World of Art Deco: An Exhibition Organized by The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, June- September 1971 | publisher=E.P.

==Origins==

===Society of Decorative Artists (1901–1913)===
[[File:Odilon Redon fireplace screen.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A fireplace screen by the [[Symbolist]] painter [[Odilon Redon]] now in the [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris (1908)]]
The emergence of Art Deco was closely connected with the rise in status of decorative artists, who until late in the 19th century had been considered simply as artisans. The term "arts décoratifs" had been invented in 1875, giving the designers of furniture, textiles, and other decoration official status. The Société des artistes décorateurs (Society of decorative artists), or SAD, was founded in 1901, and decorative artists were given the same rights of authorship as painters and sculptors. A similar movement developed in Italy. The first international exhibition devoted entirely to the decorative arts, the ''Esposizione international d'Arte decorative moderna'', was held in [[Turin]] in 1902. Several new magazines devoted to decorative arts were founded in Paris, including ''Arts et décoration'' and ''L'Art décoratif moderne''. Decorative arts sections were introduced into the annual salons of the Sociéte des artistes français, and later in the'' [[Salon d'automne]]''. French nationalism also played a part in the resurgence of decorative arts; French designers felt challenged by the increasing exports of less expensive German furnishings. In 1911, the SAD proposed the holding of a major new international exposition of decorative arts in 1912. No copies of old styles were to be permitted; only modern works. The exhibit was postponed until 1914, then, because of the war, postponed until 1925, when it gave its name to the whole family of styles known as Déco.{{Sfn|Benton|2002|pages=165-170}}

Parisian department stores and fashion designers also played an important part in the rise of Art Déco. Established firms including the luggage maker [[Louis Vuitton]], silverware firm [[Christofle]], glass designer [[René Lalique]], and the jewelers [[Louis Cartier]] and [[Boucheron]], who all began designing products in more modern styles. Beginning in 1900, department stores had recruited decorative artists to work in their design studios. The decoration of the 1912 [[Salon d'Automne]] had been entrusted to the department store [[Printemps]].&lt;ref name="Salon d'Automne 2012"&gt;[http://www.salon-automne.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/catalogue-SA-2012.pdf Salon d'Automne 2012, exhibition catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year Printemps created its own workshop called "Primavera". By 1920 Primavera employed more than three hundred artists. The styles ranged from the updated versions of Louis XIV, Louis XVI and especially Louis Philippe furniture made by [[Louis Süe]] and the Primavera workshop to more modern forms from the workshop of the Au Louvre department store. Other designers, including [[Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann]] and Paul Foliot refused to use mass production, and insisted that each piece be made individually by hand. The early art deco style featured luxurious and exotic materials such as ebony, and ivory and silk, very bright colors and stylized [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]], particularly baskets and bouquets of flowers of all colors, giving a modernist look.&lt;ref&gt;Laurent, Stephane, "L'artiste décorateur", in ''Art Deco, 1910–1939'' by Charlotte Benton, Tim Benton and Ghislain Wood (2002), Renaissance du Livre, pages 165–171&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]] (1910–1913), by [[Auguste Perret]] was the first landmark Art Deco building completed in Paris. Previously [[reinforced concrete]] had been used only for industrial and apartment buildings, Perret had built the first modern reinforced concrete apartment building in Paris on rue Benjamin Franklin in 1903-04. [[Henri Sauvage]], another important future Art Deco architect, built another in 1904 at 7 rue Trétaigne (1904). From 1908 to 1910, the 21-year old Le Corbusier worked as a draftsman in Perret's office, learning the techniques of concrete construction. Perret's building had clean rectangular form, geometric decoration and straight lines, the future trademarks of Art Deco. The decor of the theater was also revolutionary; the facade was decorated with [[Relief#High_relief|high reliefs]] by [[Antoine Bourdelle]], a dome by [[Maurice Denis]], paintings by [[Édouard Vuillard]], and an Art Deco curtain [[Ker-Xavier Roussel]]. The theater became famous as the venue for many of the first performances of the [[Ballets Russes]]. Perret and Sauvage became the leading Art Deco architects in Paris in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Collins, ''Concrete: The Vision of a New Architecture'', New York: Horizon Press, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Poisson|2009|pages=318–319}}

At its birth between 1910 and 1914, Art Deco was an explosion of colors, featuring bright and often clashing hues, frequently in floral designs, presented in furniture upholstery, carpets, screens, wallpaper and fabrics. Many colorful works, including chairs and a table by [[Maurice Dufrene]] and a bright Gobelin carpet by [[Paul Follot]] were presented at the 1912 [[Société des artistes décorateurs|Salon des artistes décorateurs]]. In 1912–1913 designer [[Adrien Karbowsky]] made a floral chair with a parrot design for the hunting lodge of art collector [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]].&lt;ref&gt;Descriptive text in the decorative arts display at the [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris&lt;/ref&gt; The furniture designers Louis Süe and [[André Mare]] made their first appearance at the 1912 exhibit, under the name of the ''Atelier Française,'' combining colorful fabrics with exotic and expensive materials, including ebony and ivory. After World War I they became one of the most prominent French interior design firms, producing the furniture for the first-class salons and cabins of the French transatlantic ocean liners.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=51-55}}

The vivid colors of Art Deco came from many sources, including the exotic set designs by [[Leon Bakst]] for the Ballets Russes, which caused a sensation in Paris just before World War I. Some of the colors were inspired by the earlier [[Fauvism]] movement led by [[Henri Matisse]]; others by the [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]] of painters such as [[Sonia Delaunay]]; others by the movement known as the Nabis, and in the work of symbolist painter Odilon Redon, who designed fireplace screens and other decorative objects. Bright colors were a feature of the work of fashion designer [[Paul Poiret]], whose work influenced both Art Deco fashion and interior design.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=51-55}}

The art style known as [[Cubism]] appeared in France between 1907 and 1912, influencing the development of Art Deco. The Cubists, themselves under the influence of [[Paul Cézanne]], were interested in the simplification of forms to their geometric essentials: the cylinder, the sphere, the cone.&lt;ref name="Erle Lora"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vpbEHESVx9cC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Cézanne,+le+cylindres,+sphères,+et+le+cônes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VWN2A52aTk&amp;sig=kFqKvxXeu6Q_DgjHn2GAb6TDbFE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VpsqUenwBom3hAfVvIGADg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=cylinder%2C%20sphere%2C%20cone&amp;f=false Erle Lora, ''Cézannes Composition: Analysis of His Form with Diagrams and Photographs of His Motifs''], Forward by Richard Shiff, University of California Press, 30 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, the artists of the [[Section d'Or]] exhibited works considerably more accessible to the general public than the analytical Cubism of Picasso and Braque. The Cubist vocabulary was poised to attract fashion, furniture and interior designers.&lt;ref&gt;''La Section d'or, 1912-1920-1925'', Cécile Debray, Françoise Lucbert, Musées de Châteauroux, Musée Fabre, exhibition catalogue, Éditions Cercle d'art, Paris, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/frdc/hd_frdc.htm|title=French Art Deco|author=Goss, Jared|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1912 writings of [[André Vera]]. ''Le Nouveau style'', published in the journal ''L'Art décoratif'', he expressed the rejection of [[Art Nouveau]] forms (asymmetric, polychrome and picturesque) and called for ''simplicité volontaire, symétrie manifeste, l'ordre et l'harmonie'', themes that would eventually become common within Art Deco; though with time the Deco style was often extremely colorful and anything but simple.&lt;ref&gt;André Vera, ''Le Nouveau style'', published in L'Art décoratif, January 1912, pp. 21–32&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Art Décoratif'' section of the 1912 Salon d'Automne, an architectural installation was exhibited known as the ''[[La Maison Cubiste]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Eve Blau, Nancy J.

The facade of the house, designed by Duchamp-Villon, was not very radical by modern standards; the lintels and pediments had prismatic shapes, but otherwise the facade resembled an ordinary house of the period. The rooms were furnished by Mare with neo-Louis XVI and Louis-Philippe style chairs and sofas that were updated with more angular features to make them go with the Cubist paintings. The critic Emile Sedeyn described Mare's work in the magazine ''Art et Décoration'': "He does not embarrass himself with simplicity, for he multiplies flowers wherever they can be put. The effect he seeks is obviously one of picturesqueness and gaiety. He achieves it."{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=52}} The Cubist element was provided by the paintings. Despite its tameness, the installation was attacked by some critics as extremely radical, which helped make for its success.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=54}} This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 [[Armory Show]], New York, Chicago and Boston.&lt;ref name="Goss" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt315s.html Kubistische werken op de Armory Show]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/detail-duchampvillons-faade-architecturale-14604 Detail of Duchamp-Villon's ''Façade architecturale'', catalog number 609, unidentified photographer, 1913.

The Cubist style continued within Art Deco, even as Deco branched out in many other directions. In 1927, Cubists [[Joseph Csaky]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Louis Marcoussis]], [[Henri Laurens]], the sculptor [[Gustave Miklos]], and others collaborated in the decoration of a Studio House, rue Saint-James, [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], designed by the architect Paul Ruaud and owned by the French fashion designer Jacques Doucet, also a collector of [[Post-Impressionist]] art by Henri Matisse and [[Cubist]] paintings (including ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', which he bought directly from Picasso's studio). Laurens designed the fountain, Csaky designed Doucet's staircase,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vlY6SLmg-xEC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=%22jacques+doucet%22+staircase+by+joseph+csaky&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jvZeOQqDNb&amp;sig=FF6sbrEJ7QnZEljAmyquHlR6oJI&amp;hl=fr#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jacques%20doucet%22%20staircase%20by%20joseph%20csaky&amp;f=false |title=Joseph Csaky's staircase in the home of Jacques Doucet |publisher=Books.google.es |date= |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lipchitz made the fireplace mantel, and Marcoussis made a Cubist rug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aestheticus Rex |url=http://aestheticusrex.blogspot.com.es/2011/04/jacques-doucets-studio-st-james-at.html |title=Jacques Doucet's Studio St. James at Neuilly-sur-Seine |publisher=Aestheticusrex.blogspot.com.es |date=14 April 2011 |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fcKfjM9OknEC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=jacques+doucet,+rue+Saint-James,+Neuilly&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QqQ4m-jgXG&amp;sig=5RJ8fjC4pmSaCE2b9sRNDNN3IfM&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=jacques%20doucet%2C%20rue%20Saint-James%2C%20Neuilly&amp;f=false |title='&amp;#39;The Modernist Garden in France'&amp;#39;, Dorothée Imbert, 1993, Yale University Press |publisher=Books.google.es |date= |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUPz18-QeyEC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=jacques+doucet,+joseph+Csaky&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wywyzJn6BX&amp;sig=SeI2no9a60nGo0uIEfOSpbjxWVM&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=jacques%20doucet%2C%20joseph%20Csaky&amp;f=false |title=Joseph Csáky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture, Edith Balas, 1998, p. 5 |publisher=Books.google.es |date= |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the Cubist artists, Doucet brought in other Deco interior designers to help in decorating the house, including Pierre Legrain, who was in charge of organizing the decoration, and [[Paul Iribe]], Marcel Coard, [[André Groult]], [[Eileen Gray]] and Rose Adler to provide furniture. The decor included massive pieces made of macassar ebony, inspired by African art, and furniture covered with Morocco leather, crocodile skin and snakeskin, and patterns taken from African designs.{{Sfn|Arwas|1982|page=70}}

Art Deco was not a single style, but a collection of different and sometimes contradictory styles. In architecture, Art Deco was the successor to and reaction against Art Nouveau, a style which flourished in Europe between 1895 and 1900, and also gradually replaced the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] that were predominant in European and American architecture. In 1905 [[Eugène Grasset]] wrote and published ''Méthode de Composition Ornementale, Éléments Rectilignes,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6109619d |title=Eugène Grasset, '&amp;#39;Méthode de composition ornementale, Éléments rectilignes'&amp;#39;, 1905, Librarie Centrale des Beaux-Arts, Paris (in French) |language=fr |publisher=Gallica.bnf.fr |date= |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he systematically explored the decorative (ornamental) aspects of geometric elements, forms, motifs and their variations, in contrast with (and as a departure from) the undulating Art Nouveau style of [[Hector Guimard]], so popular in Paris a few years earlier. Grasset stressed the principle that various simple geometric shapes like triangles and squares are the basis of all compositional arrangements. The reinforced concrete buildings of Auguste Perret and Henri Sauvage, and particularly the [[Theatre des Champs-Elysees]], offered a new form of construction and decoration which was copied worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/mthodedecomposit01gras |title=Eugène Grasset, '&amp;#39;Méthode de composition ornementale'&amp;#39;, 1905, Full Text (in French) |publisher=Archive.org |date=10 March 2001 |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In decoration, many different styles were borrowed and used by Art Deco. They included pre-modern art from around the world and observable at the [[Musée du Louvre]], [[Musée de l'Homme]] and the [[Musée national des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie]]. There was also popular interest in archeology due to excavations at [[Pompeii]], [[Troy]], and the tomb of the 18th dynasty Pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]]. Artists and designers integrated motifs from [[ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], Asia, [[Mesoamerica]] and [[Oceania]] with [[Machine Age]] elements.&lt;ref name="Art Deco Style"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm |title=Art Deco Style |publisher=Museum of London |accessdate=6 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080207022236/http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm |archivedate=7 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Essential Art Deco"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Ghislaine |title=Essential Art Deco |publisher=VA&amp;A Publications |location=London |isbn=0-8212-2833-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Design: A Concise History"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hauffe |first=Thomas |title=Design: A Concise History |publisher=Laurence King |location=London |year=1998 |edition=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/nal/guides/art_deco/index.html |title=Art Deco Study Guide |publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum |accessdate=1 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025210428/http://www.vam.ac.uk/nal/guides/art_deco/index.html |archivedate=25 October 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.decopix.com/New%20Site/Pages/Directory%20Pages/Intro.html |title=Introduction to Art Deco |last=Juster |first=Randy |publisher=decopix.com |accessdate=7 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029202446/http://www.decopix.com/New%20Site/Pages/Directory%20Pages/Intro.html |archivedate=29 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University Times"&gt;{{cite journal |date=9 October 2003 |title=How Art Deco came to be |journal=University Times | publisher=University of Pittsburgh |volume=36 |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other styles borrowed included Russian [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and Italian [[Futurism]], as well as Orphism, [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]], and [[Modernism]] in general.&lt;ref name="Goss" /&gt;{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=8-10}}&lt;ref name="Art Deco Style" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Art, Design and Visual Thinking"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://char.txa.cornell.edu/art/decart/artdeco/artdeco.htm |title=Art, Design and Visual Thinking |last=Jirousek |first=Charlotte |year=1995 |accessdate=7 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202040916/http://char.txa.cornell.edu/art/decart/artdeco/artdeco.htm |archivedate=2 December 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Art Deco also used the clashing colors and designs of Fauvism, notably in the work of Henri Matisse and [[André Derain]], inspired the designs of art deco textiles, wallpaper, and painted ceramics.&lt;ref name="Goss" /&gt;  It took ideas from the high fashion vocabulary of the period, which featured geometric designs, chevrons, zigzags, and stylized bouquets of flowers. It was influenced by discoveries in [[Egyptology]], and growing interest in the Orient and in African art. From 1925 onwards, it was often inspired by a passion for new machines, such as airships, automobiles and ocean liners, and by 1930 this influence resulted in the style called [[streamline moderne]].{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=7-8}}

==Style of luxury and modernity==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Art Deco was associated with both luxury and modernity; it combined very expensive materials and exquisite craftsmanship put into modernistic forms. Nothing was cheap about Art Deco: pieces of furniture included ivory and silver inlays, and pieces of Art Deco jewelry combined diamonds with platinum, jade, and other precious materials. The style was used to decorate the first-class salons of ocean liners, deluxe trains, and skyscrapers. It was used around the world to decorate the great movie palaces of the late 1920s and 1930s. Later, after the [[Great Depression]], the style changed and became more sober.

A good example of the luxury style of Art Deco is the boudoir of the fashion designer [[Jeanne Lanvin]], designed by [[Armand-Albert Rateau]] (1882-1938) made between 1922-25. It was located in her house at 16 rue Barbet de Jouy, in Paris, which was demolished in 1965. The room was reconstructed in the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris. The walls are covered with molded ''lambris'' below sculpted bas-reliefs in stucco. The alcove is framed with columns of marble on with bases and a plinth of sculpted wood. The floor is of white and black marble, and in the cabinets decorative objects are displayed against a background of blue silk. Her bathroom had a tub and washstand made of sienna marble, with a wall of carved stucco and bronze fittings.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=82}}

By 1928 the style had become more comfortable, with deep leather club chairs. The study designed by the Paris firm of Alavoine for an American businessman in 1928-30, now in the [[Brooklyn Museum]], had a unique American feature. Since it was constructed during [[Prohibition]], when serving alcohol was prohibited, it included a secret bar hidden behind the panels.&lt;ref&gt;Home Page of the [[Brooklyn Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, the style had been somewhat simplified, but it was still extravagant. In 1932 the decorator Paul Ruoud made the Glass Salon for Suzanne Talbot. It featured a serpentine armchair and two tubular armchairs by Eileen Gray, a floor of mat silvered glass slabs, a panel of abstract patterns in silver and black lacquer, and an assortment of animal skins.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=77}}

{{main article|International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts}}
The event that marked the zenith of the style and gave it its name was the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] which took place in Paris from April to October in 1925.  This was officially sponsored by the French government, and covered a site in Paris of 55 acres, running from the [[Grand Palais]] on the right bank to [[Les Invalides]] on the left bank, and along the banks of the Seine. The Grand Palais, the largest hall in the city, was filled with exhibits of decorative arts from the participating countries. There were 15,000 exhibitors from twenty different countries, including England, Italy, Spain, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Japan, and the new [[Soviet Union]], though Germany was not invited because of tensions after the war and the United States, misunderstanding the purpose of the exhibit, declined to participate. It was visited by sixteen million people during its seven-month run. The rules of the exhibition required that all work be modern; no historical styles were allowed. The main purpose of the Exhibit was to promote the French manufacturers of luxury furniture, porcelain, glass, metal work, textiles and other decorative products. To further promote the products, all the major Paris department stores and major designers had their own pavilions. The Exposition had a secondary purpose in promoting products from French colonies in Africa and Asia, including ivory and exotic woods.

The Hôtel du Riche Collectionneur was a popular attraction at the Exposition; it displayed the new furniture designs of Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann, as well as Art Deco fabrics, carpets, and a painting by [[Jean Dupas]]. The interior design followed the same principles of symmetry and geometric forms which set it apart from Art Nouveau, and bright colors, fine craftsmanship rare and expensive materials which set it apart from the strict functionality of the Modernist style. While most of the pavilions were lavishly decorated and filled with hand-made luxury furniture, two pavilions, those of the Soviet Union and Pavilion du Nouveau Esprit, built by the magazine of that name run by Le Corbusier, were built in an austere style with plain white walls and no decoration; they were among the earliest examples of [[modernist architecture]].{{Sfn|Charles|2013|pages=35-104}}

American skyscrapers marked the summit of the Art Deco style; they became the tallest and most recognizable modern buildings in the world. They were designed to show the prestige of their builders through their height, their shape, their color, and their dramatic illumination at night.&lt;ref&gt;John Burchard and Albert Bush Brown, ''The Architecture of America'' (1966), Atlantic, Little and Brown, page 277&lt;/ref&gt; The first New York skyscraper, the [[Woolworth Building]], in a neoclassical style, was completed in 1913, and the American Telephone and Telegraph Building (1924) had ionic and doric columns and a classical Doric [[hypostyle]] with a frieze. The [[American Radiator Building]] by [[Raymond Hood]] (1924) combined Gothic and Deco modern elements in the design of the building. Black brick on the frontage of the building (symbolizing coal) was selected to give an idea of solidity and to give the building a solid mass. Other parts of the facade were covered in gold bricks (symbolizing fire), and the entry was decorated with marble and black mirrors. Another early Art Deco skyscraper was Detroit's [[Guardian Building]], which opened in 1929. Designed by modernist [[Wirt C. Rowland]], the building was the first to employ stainless steel as a decorative element, and the extensive use of colored designs in place of traditional ornaments.

The New York skyline was radically changed by the [[Chrysler Building]] in Manhattan (completed in 1930), designed by [[William Van Alen]]. It was a giant seventy-seven floor tall advertisement for Chrysler automobiles. The top was crowned by a stainless steel spire, and was ornamented by deco "gargoyles" in the form of stainless steel radiator cap decorations. The base of the tower, thirty-three stories above the street, was decorated with colorful art deco friezes, and the lobby was decorated with art deco symbols and images expressing modernity.{{Sfn|Benton|202|pages=249-258}}

The Chrysler Building was followed by the [[Empire State Building]] by [[William F. Lamb]] (1931) and the RCA Building (now the [[Comcast Building]]) in [[Rockefeller Center]], by Raymond Hood (1933) which together completely changed the skyline of New York. The tops of the buildings were decorated with Art Deco crowns and spires covered with stainless steel, and, in the case of the Chrysler building, with Art Deco gargoyles modeled after radiator ornaments, while the entrances and lobbies were lavishly decorated with Art Deco sculpture, ceramics, and design. Similar buildings, though not quite as tall, soon appeared in Chicago and other large American cities. The Chrysler Building was soon surpassed in height by the Empire State Building, in a slightly less lavish Deco style. Rockefeller Center added a new design element: several tall building grouped around an open plaza, with a fountain in the center.{{Sfn|Morel|2012|pages=125-30}}

In 1925 two different competing schools coexisted within Art Deco: the traditionalists, who had founded the Society of Decorative Artists; included the furniture designer Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann, Jean Dunard, the sculptor Antoine Bourdelle, and designer Paul Poiret; they combined modern forms with traditional craftsmanship and expensive materials. On the other side were the modernists, who increasingly rejected the past and wanted a style based upon advances in new technologies, simplicity, a lack of decoration, inexpensive materials, and mass production. The modernists founded their own organization, [[The French Union of Modern Artists]], in 1929. Its members included architects [[Pierre Chareau]], [[Francis Jourdain]], [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]], Corbusier, and, in the Soviet Union, [[Konstantin Melnikov]]; the Irish designer Eileen Gray, and French designer Sonia Delaunay, the jewelers [[Jean Fouquet]] and [[Jean Puiforcat]]. They fiercely attacked the traditional art deco style, which they said was created only for the wealthy, and insisted that well-constructed buildings should be available to everyone, and that form should follow function. The beauty of an object or building resided in whether it was perfectly fit to fulfill its function. Modern industrial methods meant that furniture and buildings could be mass-produced, not made by hand.&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''Vers une architecture'', Flammarion, republished in 1995, page xix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larousse Encyclopedia on-line edition (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art Deco interior designer Paul Follot defended Art Deco in this way: "We know that man is never content with the indispensable and that the superfluous is always needed...If not, we would have to get rid of music, flowers, and perfumes..!"{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=8}} However, Le Corbusier was a brilliant publicist for modernist architecture; he stated that a house was simply "a machine to live in", and tirelessly promoted the idea that Art Deco was the past and modernism was the future. Le Corbusier's ideas were gradually adopted by architecture schools, and the aesthetics of Art Deco were abandoned. The same features that made Art Deco popular in the beginning, its craftsmanship, rich materials and ornament, led to its decline. The Great Depression that began in the United States in 1929, and reached Europe shortly afterwards, greatly reduced the number of wealthy clients who could pay for the furnishings and art objects. In the Depression economic climate, few companies were ready to build new skyscrapers.&lt;ref name="Goss" /&gt; Even the Ruhlmann firm resorted to producing pieces of furniture in series, rather than individual hand-made items. The last buildings built in Paris in the new style were the Museum of Public Works by Auguste Perret (now the [[French Economic, Social and Environmental Council]]) and the [[Palais de Chaillot]] by [[Louis-Hippolyte Boileau]], [[Jacques Carlu]] and [[Léon Azéma]], and the [[Palais de Tokyo]] of the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 Paris International Exposition]]; they looked out at the grandiose pavilion of Nazi Germany, designed by [[Albert Speer]], which faced the equally grandiose socialist-realist pavilion of Stalin's Soviet Union.

After World War II the dominant architectural style became the International Style pioneered by Le Corbusier, and [[Mies Van der Rohe]]. A handful of Art Deco hotels were built in [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]] after World War II, but elsewhere the style largely vanished, except in industrial design, where it continued to be used in automobile styling and products such as jukeboxes. In the 1960s, it experienced a modest academic revival, thanks in part to the writings of architectural historians such as Bevis Hillier. In the 1970s efforts were made in the United States and Europe to preserve the best examples of Art Deco architecture, and many buildings were restored and repurposed. [[Postmodern architecture]], which first appeared in the 1980s, like Art Deco, often includes purely decorative features.&lt;ref name="Goss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Art Deco Style" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Design Handbook"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fell | first=Charlotte |first2=Peter |last2=Fell |title=Design Handbook: Concepts, Materials and Styles |publisher=Taschen |year=2006 |edition=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Art Deco (1920s to 1930s)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm |title=Art Deco (1920s to 1930s) |last=Heindorf |first=Anne |date=24 July 2006 |accessdate=6 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080207022236/http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm |archivedate=7 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deco continues to inspire designers, and is often used in contemporary fashion, jewelry, and toiletries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.unsw.edu.au/~thesis/adt-NUN/uploads/approved/adt-NUN20060515.093519/public/02whole.pdf |title=The Decorative in Twentieth Century Art: A Story of Decline and Resurgence |first=Pamela |last=Gaunt |date=August 2005 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217013725/http://www.library.unsw.edu.au/~thesis/adt-NUN/uploads/approved/adt-NUN20060515.093519/public/02whole.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no section set aside for painting at the 1925 Exposition. Art deco painting was by definition decorative, designed to decorate a room or work of architecture, so few painters worked exclusively in the style, but two painters are closely associated with Art Deco. Jean Dupas painted Art Deco murals for the Bordeaux Pavilion at the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition in Paris, and also painted the picture over the fireplace in the Maison de la Collectioneur exhibit at the 1925 Exposition, which featured furniture by Ruhlmann and other prominent Art Deco designers. His murals were also prominent in the decor of the French ocean liner [[SS Normandie|SS ''Normandie'']]. His work was purely decorative, designed as a background or accompaniment to other elements of the decor.&lt;ref&gt;Louis René Vian, ''Les Arts décoratifs à bord des paquebots français'', Éditions Fonmare, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The other painter closely associated with the style is [[Tamara de Lempicka]]. Born in Poland, she emigrated to Paris after the [[Russian Revolution]]. She studied under [[Maurice Denis]] and [[André Lhote]], and borrowed many elements from their styles. She painted portraits in a realistic, dynamic and colorful Art Deco style.&lt;ref&gt;Blondel, Alain (1999). ''Tamara de Lempicka: a Catalogue Raisonné 1921–1980''. Lausanne: Editions Acatos.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s a dramatic new form of Art Deco painting appeared in the United States. During the Great Depression, the [[Federal Art Project]] of the [[Works Progress Administration]] was created to give work to unemployed artists. Many were given the task of decorating government buildings, hospitals and schools. There was no specific art deco style used in the murals; artists engaged to paint murals in government buildings came from many different schools, from American regionalism to [[social realism]]; they included [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], [[Rockwell Kent]] and the Mexican painter [[Diego Rivera]]. The murals were Art Deco because they were all decorative and related to the activities in the building or city where they were painted: Reginald Marsh and Rockwell Kent both decorated U.S. postal buildings, and showed postal employees at work while Diego Rivera depicted automobile factory workers for the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]. Diego Rivera's mural ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'' (1933) for Rockefeller Center featured an unauthorized portrait of [[Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;Balfour, Alan (1978).

Most of the sculpture of the Art Deco period was, as the name suggests, purely decorative; it was designed not for museums, but to ornament office buildings, government buildings, public squares and private salons. It was almost always representational, usually of heroic or allegorical figures related to the purpose of the building; the themes were usually chosen by the patron, and abstract sculpture for decoration was extremely rare. It was frequently attached to facade of buildings, particularly over the entrances and lobbies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?isbn=0671808044 Eva Weber, ''Art deco in America''], Exeter Books, 1985, p. 32, {{ISBN|0671808044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegorical sculptures of the dance and music by Antoine Bourdelle were the essential decorative feature of the earliest Art Deco landmark in Paris, the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]] in Paris, in 1912. The sculptor [[Aristide Maillol]] reinvented the classical ideal for his statue of the River (1939), now at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. In the 1930s, a whole team of sculptors made sculpture for the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne at Chaillot. The buildings of the Exposition were covered with low-relief sculpture, statues. [[Alfred Janniot]] made the relief sculptures on the facade of the Palais de Tokyo. The [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]], and the esplanade in front of the Palais de Chaillot, facing the Eiffel Tower, was crowded with new statuary by [[Charles Malfray]], Henry Arnold, and many others.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=165-66}}

In the United States, many European sculptors trained at the École des Beaux Arts in Paris, came to work; they included [[Gutzon Borglum]], sculptor of Mount Rushmore [[Lincoln Memorial]]. Other American sculptors, including [[Harriet Whitney Frishmuth]], had studied with [[Auguste Rodin]] in Paris. The 1929 stock market crash largely destroyed the market for monumental sculpture, but one grand project remained; the new Rockefeller Center. The American sculptors [[Lee Lawrie]] and [[Paul Manship]] designed heroic allegorical figures for facade and plaza. In San Francisco, [[Ralph Stackpole]] provided sculpture for the facade of the new [[San Francisco Stock Exchange]] building.

One of the best known and certainly the largest Art Deco sculpture is the ''[[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]]'' by the French sculptor [[Paul Landowski]], completed between 1922 and 1931, located on a mountain top overlooking [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. [[François Pompon]] was a pioneer of modern stylized [[animalier]] sculpture. He was not fully recognized for his artistic accomplishments until the age of 67 at the Salon d'Automne of 1922 with the work ''Ours blanc'', also known as ''The White Bear'', now in the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=Kjellberg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kjellberg|first1=Pierre|title=Bronzes of the 19th Century|date=1994|publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd.|location=Atglen, Pennsylvania|isbn=0-88740-629-7|page=551|edition=First}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 July 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Many early Art Deco sculptures were small, designed to decorate salons. One genre of this sculpture was called the [[Chryselephantine]] statuette, named for a style of ancient Greek temple statues made of gold and ivory. One of the best-known Art Deco salon sculptors was the Romanian-born [[Demétre Chiparus]], who produced colorful small sculptures of dancers. Other notable salon sculptors included [[Ferdinand Preiss]], [[Josef Lorenzl]], Alexander Kelety, Dorothea Charol and Gustav Schmidtcassel.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=141-163}}

Parallel with these more neoclassical sculptors, more avant-garde and abstract sculptors were at work in Paris and New York. The most prominent were [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Joseph Csaky]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Henri Laurens]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Gustave Miklos]], [[Jean Lambert-Rucki]], [[Jan et Joël Martel]], [[Chana Orloff]] and [[Pablo Gargallo]].&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_0T8LAAAAIAAJ Edith Balas, 1998, ''Joseph Csaky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture''], Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art Deco style appeared early in the graphic arts, in the years just before World War I. It appeared in Paris in the posters and the costume designs of Leon Bakst for the Ballets Russes, and in the catalogs of the fashion designers Paul Poiret.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/robesdePaulPoir00Irib Paul Iribe, ''Les robes de Paul Poiret'', 1908]&lt;/ref&gt; The illustrations of [[Georges Barbier]], and Georges Lepape and the images in the fashion magazine ''La Gazette du bon ton'' perfectly captured the elegance and sensuality of the style. In the 1920s, the look changed; the fashions stressed were more casual, sportive and daring, with the woman models usually smoking cigarettes. American fashion magazines such as ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' and ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' quickly picked up the new style and popularized it in the United States. It also influenced the work of American book illustrators such as Rockwell Kent. In Germany, the most famous poster artist of the period was [[Ludwig Hohlwein]], who created colorful and dramatic posters for music festivals, beers, and, late in his career, for the Nazi Party.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=148-150}}

During the Art Nouveau period, posters usually advertised theatrical products or cabarets. In the 1920s, travel posters, made for steamship lines and airlines, became extremely popular. The style changed notably in the 1920s, to focus attention on the product being advertised. The images became simpler, precise, more linear, more dynamic, and were often placed against a single color background. In France popular Art Deco designers included, Charles Loupot and [[Paul Colin (artist)|Paul Colin]], who became famous for his posters of American singer and dancer [[Josephine Baker]]. Jean Carlu designed posters for Charlie Chaplin movies, soaps, and theaters; in the late 1930s he emigrated to the United States, where, during the World War, he designed posters to encourage war production. The designer Charles Gesmar became famous making posters for the singer [[Mistinguett]] and for [[Air France]]. Among the best known French Art Deco poster designers was [[Cassandre (artist)|Cassandre]], who made the celebrated poster of the ocean liner SS ''Normandie'' in 1935.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=148-150}}

In the 1930s a new genre of posters appeared in the United States during the Great Depression. The Federal Art Project hired American artists to create posters to promote tourism and cultural events.

The architectural style of art deco made its debut in Paris in 1903-04, with the construction of two apartment buildings in Paris, one by Auguste Perret on rue Trétaigne and the other on rue Benjamin Franklin by Henri Sauvage. The two young architects used reinforced concrete for the first time in Paris residential buildings; the new buildings had clean lines, rectangular forms, and no decoration on the facades; they marked a clean break with the [[Art Nouveau|art nouveau]] style.{{Sfn|Poisson|2009|pages 299 and 318}} Between 1910 and 1913, Perret used his experience in concrete apartment buildings to construct the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, 15 [[avenue Montaigne]]. Between 1925 and 1928 he constructed the new art deco facade of the [[La Samaritaine]] department store in Paris.{{Sfn|Plum|2014|page=134}}

After the First World War, art deco buildings of steel and reinforced concrete began to appear in large cities across Europe and the United States. In the United States the style was most commonly used for office buildings, government buildings, movie theaters, and railroad stations. It sometimes was combined with other styles; [[Los Angeles City Hall]] combined Art Deco with a roof based on the ancient Greek [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]], while the [[Los Angeles railroad station]] combined Deco with Spanish mission architecture. Art Deco elements also appeared in engineering projects, including the towers of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] and the intake towers of [[Hoover Dam]]. In the 1920s and 1930s it became a truly international style, with examples including the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] (Palace of Fine Arts) in [[Mexico City]] by {{ill|Federico Mariscal|es}}, the [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya Metro Station]] in [[Moscow]] and the [[National Diet Building]] in Tokyo by Watanabe Fukuzo.

The Art Deco style was not limited to buildings on land; the ocean liner SS ''Normandie'', whose first voyage was in 1935, featured Art Deco design, including a dining room whose ceiling and decoration were made of glass by [[Lalique]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The grand showcases of Art deco interior design were the lobbies of government buildings, theaters, and particularly office buildings. Interiors were extremely colorful and dynamic, combining sculpture, murals, and ornate geometric design in marble, glass, ceramics and stainless steel. An early example was the [[Fisher Building]] in Detroit, by [[Joseph Nathaniel French]]; the lobby was highly decorated with sculpture and ceramics. The [[Guardian Building]] (originally the Union Trust Building) in Detroit, by [[Wirt Rowland]] (1929), decorated with red and black marble and brightly colored ceramics, highlighted by highly polished steel elevator doors and counters. The sculptural decoration installed in the walls illustrated the virtues of industry and saving; the building was immediately termed the "Cathedral of Commerce". The Medical and Dental Building called [[450 Sutter Street]] in San Francisco by [[Timothy Pflueger]] was inspired by [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] architecture, in a highly stylized form; it used pyramid shapes, and the interior walls were covered highly stylized rows of hieroglyphs.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=198-200}}

In France, the best example of an Art Deco interior during period was the [[Palais de la Porte Dorée]] (1931) by [[Albert Laprade]], [[Léon Jaussely]] and [[Léon Bazin]]. The building (now the National Museum of Immigration, with an aquarium in the basement) was built for the [[Paris Colonial Exposition of 1931]], to celebrate the people and products of French colonies. The exterior facade was entirely covered with sculpture, and the lobby created an Art Deco harmony with a wood parquet floor in a geometric pattern, a mural depicting the people of French colonies; and a harmonious composition of vertical doors and horizontal balconies.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=198-200}}

Many of the best surviving examples of Art Deco are movie theaters built in the 1920s and 1930s. The Art Deco period coincided with the conversion of silent films to sound, and movie companies built enormous theaters in major cities to capture the huge audience that came to see movies. Movie palaces in the 1920s often combined exotic themes with art deco style; [[Grauman's Egyptian Theater]] in Hollywood (1922) was inspired by ancient Egyptian [[tomb]]s and [[pyramid]]s, while the [[Fox Theater (Bakersfield, California)|Fox Theater]] in Bakersfield, California attached a tower in California Mission style to an Art Deco hall. The largest of all is [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City, which opened in 1932. Originally designed as a stage theater, it quickly transformed into a movie theater, which could seat 6,015 persons The interior design by [[Donald Deskey]] used glass, aluminum, chrome, and leather to create a colorful escape from reality The [[Paramount Theater (Oakland, California)|Paramount Theater]] in Oakland, California, by Timothy Pflueger, had a colorful ceramic facade a lobby four stories high, and separate Art Deco smoking rooms for gentlemen and ladies. Similar grand palaces appeared in Europe. The [[Grand Rex]] in Paris (1932), with its imposing tower, was the largest movie theater in Europe. The [[Gaumont State Cinema]] in London (1937) had a tower modeled after the Empire State building, covered with cream-colored ceramic tiles and an interior in an Art Deco-Italian Renaissance style. The [[Paramount (Shanghai)|Paramount]] Theater in [[Shanghai]], China (1933) was originally built as a dance hall called ''The gate of 100 pleasures''; it was converted to a movie theater after the Communist Revolution in 1949, and now is a ballroom and disco. In the 1930s Italian architects built a small movie palace, the Cinema Impero, in [[Asmara]] in what is now [[Eritrea]]. Today, many of the movie theaters have been subdivided into multiplexes, but others have been restored and are used as cultural centers in their communities.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=197-199}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the late 1930s, a new variety of Art Deco architecture became common; it was called [[Streamline Moderne]] or simply Streamline, or, in France, the Style Paqueboat, or Ocean Liner style. Buildings in the style were had rounded corners, long horizontal lines; they were built of reinforced concrete, and were almost always white; and sometimes had nautical features, such as railings that resembled those on a ship. The rounded corner was not entirely new; it had appeared in Berlin in 1923 in the [[Mossehaus]] by [[Erich Mendelsohn]], and later in the [[Hoover Building]], an industrial complex in the London suburb of [[Perivale]]. In the United States, it became most closely associated with transport; Streamline moderne was rare in office buildings, but was often used for bus stations and airport terminals, such as terminal at La Guardia airport in New York City that handled the first transatlantic flights, via the PanAm clipper flying boats; and in roadside architecture, such as gas stations and diners. In the late 1930s a series of diners, modeled after streamlined railroad cars, were produced and installed in towns in New England; at least two examples still remain and are now registered historic buildings.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=197}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Decoration in the Art Deco period went through several distinct phases. Between 1910 and 1920, as Art Nouveau was exhausted, design styles saw a return to tradition, particularly in the work of Paul Iribe. In 1912 André Vera published an essay in the magazine ''L'Art Décoratif'' calling for a return to the craftsmanship and materials of earlier centuries, and using a new repertoire of forms taken from nature, particularly baskets and garlands of fruit and flowers. A second tendency of Art Deco, also from 1910 to 1920, was inspired by the bright colors of the artistic movement known as the [[Fauvism|Fauves]] and by the colorful costumes and sets of the Ballets Russes. This style was often expressed with exotic materials such as sharkskin, mother of pearl, ivory, tinted leather, lacquered and painted wood, and decorative inlays on furniture that emphasized its geometry. This period of the style reached its high point in the 1925 Paris Exposition of Decorative Arts. In the late 1920s and the 1930s, the decorative style changed, inspired by new materials and technologies. It became sleeker and less ornamental. Furniture, like architecture, began to have rounded edges and to take on a polished, streamlined look, taken from the streamline modern style. New materials, such as chrome-plated steel, aluminum and [[bakelite]], an early form of plastic, began to appear in furniture and decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Explanatory text on Art Deco in the Museum of Decorative Arts, Paris&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Art Deco period, and particularly in the 1930s, the motifs of the decor expressed the function of the building. Theaters were decorated with sculpture which illustrated music, dance, and excitement; power companies showed sunrises, the Chrysler building showed stylized hood ornaments; The friezes of Palais de la Porte Dorée at the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition showed the faces of the different nationalities of French colonies. The Streamline style made it appear that the building itself was in motion. The WPA murals of the 1930s featured ordinary people; factory workers, postal workers, families and farmers, in place of classical heroes.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=250}}

French furniture from 1910 until the early 1920s was largely an updating of French traditional furniture styles, and the art nouveau designs of [[Louis Majorelle]], [[Charles Plumet]] and other manufacturers. French furniture manufacturers felt threatened by the growing popularity of German manufacturers and styles, particularly the [[Biedermeier]] style, which was simple and clean-lined. The French designer Frantz Jourdain, the President of the Paris Salon d'Automne, invited designers from Munich to participate in the 1910 Salon. French designers saw the new German style, and decided to meet the German challenge. The French designers decided to present new French styles in the Salon of 1912. The rules of the Salon indicated that only modern styles would be permitted. All of the major French furniture designers took part in Salon: Paul Follot, Paul Iribe, Maurice Dufrene, André Groult, André Mare and Louis Suë took part, presenting new works that updated the traditional French styles of Louis XVI and [[Louis Philippe]] with more angular corners inspired by Cubism and brighter colors inspired by Fauvism and the Nabis.{{Sfn|Benton|2002|pages=91-93}}

The painter André Mare and furniture designer [[Louis Suë]] both participated the 1912 Salon. After the war the two men joined together to form their own company, formally called the ''Compagnie des Arts Française'', but usually known simply as Suë and Mare. Unlike the prominent art nouveau designers like Louis Majorelle, who personally designed every piece, they assembled a team of skilled craftsmen and produced complete interior designs, including furniture, glassware, carpets, ceramics, wallpaper and lighting. Their work featured bright colors and furniture and fine woods, such ebony encrusted with mother of pearl, abalone and silvered metal to create bouquets of flowers. They designed everything from the interiors of ocean liners to perfume bottles for the label of [[Jean Patou]].The firm prospered in the early 1920s, but the two men were better craftsmen than businessmen. The firm was sold in 1928, and both men left.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=51}}

The most prominent furniture designer at the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition was Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann, from Alsace. He first exhibited his works at the 1913 Autumn Salon, then had his own pavilion, the "House of the Rich Collector", at the 1925 Exposition. He used only most rare and expensive materials, including [[ebony]], [[mahogany]], [[rosewood]], [[Ambon Island|ambon]] and other exotic woods, decorated with inlays of ivory, tortoise shell, mother of pearl, Little pompoms of silk decorated the handles of drawers of the cabinets.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=15}} His furniture was based upon 18th-century models, but simplified and reshaped. In all of his work, the interior structure of the furniture was completely concealed. The framework usually of oak, was completely covered with an overlay of thin strips of wood, then covered by a second layer of strips of rare and expensive woods. This was then covered with a veneer and polished, so that the piece looked as if it had been cut out of a single block of wood. Contrast to the dark wood was provided by inlays of ivory, and ivory key plates and handles. According to Ruhlmann, armchairs had to be designed differently according to the functions of the rooms where they appeared; living room armchairs were designed to be welcoming, office chairs comfortable, and salon chairs voluptuous. Only a small number of pieces of each design of furniture was made, and the average price of one of his beds or cabinets was greater than the price of an average house.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=56}}

[[Jules Leleu]] was a traditional furniture designer who moved smoothly into Art Deco in the 1920s; he designed the furniture for the dining room of the [[Élysée Palace]], and for the first-class cabins of the steamship ''Normandie''. his style was characterized by the use of ebony, Macassar wood, walnut, with decoration of plaques of ivory and mother of pearl. He introduced the style of lacquered art deco furniture at the end of in the late 1920s, and in the late 1930s introduced furniture made of metal with panels of smoked glass.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=18-19}} In Italy, the designer [[Gio Ponti]] was famous for his streamlined designs.

The costly and exotic furniture of Ruhlmann and other traditionalists infuriated modernists, including the architect Le Corbusier, causing him to write a famous series of articles denouncing the ''arts décoratif'' style. He attacked furniture made only for the rich, and called upon designers to create furniture made with inexpensive materials and modern style, which ordinary people could afford. He designed his own chairs, created to be inexpensive and mass-produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/dsgn2/hd_dsgn2.htm Alexandra Griffith Winton, ''Design, 1925–50''. The Metropolitain Museum of Art, Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, October 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, furniture designs adapted to the form, with smoother surfaces and curved forms. The masters of the late style included Donald Deskey was one of the most influential designers; he created the interior of the Radio City Music Hall. He used a mixture of traditional and very modern materials, including aluminum, chrome, and bakelite, an early form of plastic.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=36}} The [[Waterfall style]] was popular the 1930s and 1940s, the most prevalent Art Deco form of furniture at the time. Pieces were typically of plywood finished with blond veneer and with rounded edges, resembling a waterfall.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Dan|title=Furniture of the Jazz Age|journal=Old-House Interiors|publisher=William J.

Streamline was a variety of Art Deco which emerged during the mid-1930s. It was influenced by modern [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] principles developed for aviation and [[ballistics]] to reduce aerodynamic drag at high velocities. The bullet shapes were applied by designers to cars, trains, ships, and even objects not intended to move, such as [[refrigerator]]s, [[Fuel dispenser|gas pumps]], and buildings.&lt;ref name="Design: A Concise History" /&gt; One of the first production vehicles in this style was the [[Chrysler Airflow]] of 1933. It was unsuccessful commercially, but the beauty and functionality of its design set a precedent; meant modernity. It continued to be used in car design well after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gartman |first=David |title=Auto Opium |publisher=Routledge |year=1994 |pages=122–124 | isbn=978-0-415-10572-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.phxart.org/exhibition/exhibitioncurves.aspx |title=Curves of Steel: Streamlined Automobile Design |publisher=Phoenix Art Museum |year=2007 | accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Armi |first=C.

New industrial materials began to influence design of cars and household objects. These included [[aluminum]], [[chrome plating|chrome]], and bakelite, an early form of plastic. Bakelite could be easily molded into different forms, and soon was used in telephones, radios and other appliances.

Ocean liners also adopted a style of Art Deco, known in French as the ''Style Paquebot'', or "Ocean Liner Style". The most famous example was the SS ''Normandie'', which made its first transatlantic trip in 1935. It was designed particularly to bring wealthy Americans to Paris to shop. The cabins and salons featured the latest Art Deco furnishings and decoration. The Grand Salon of the ship, which was the restaurant for first-class passengers, was bigger than the Hall of Mirrors of the [[Palace of Versailles]]. It was illuminated by electric lights within twelve pillars of Lalique crystal; thirty-six matching pillars lined the walls. This was one of the earliest examples of illumination being directly integrated into architecture. The style of ships was soon adapted to buildings. A notable example is found on the San Francisco waterfront, where the Maritime Museum building, built as a public bath in 1937, resembles a ferryboat, with ship railings and rounded corners. The Star Ferry Terminal in Hong Kong also used a variation of the style.&lt;ref name="Goss" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Art Deco influenced fashion with a combination of geometric shapes, avant-garde style and luxury in clothing such as works of [[Paul Poiret]], [[Charles Worth]] and [[Jean Patou]]. In the 1920s, designers were inspired by the stage sets of the [[Ballets Russes]], fabric designs and costumes from [[Léon Bakst]] and creations by the [[Wiener Werkstätte]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the 1920s and 1930s, designers including René Lalique and Cartier tried reduce the traditional dominance of [[diamonds]] by introducing more colorful gemstones, such as small emeralds, rubies and sapphires. They also placed greater emphasis on very elaborate and elegant settings, featuring less-expensive materials such as enamel, glass, horn and ivory. Diamonds themselves were cut in less traditional forms; the 1925 Exposition saw a large number of diamonds cut in the form of tiny rods or matchsticks. The settings for diamonds also changed; More and more often jewelers used [[platinum]] instead of gold, since it was strong and flexible, and could set clusters of stones. Jewelers also began to use more dark materials, such as enamels and black [[onyx]], which provided a higher contrast with diamonds.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=121-123}}

Jewelry became much more colorful and varied in style. Cartier and the firm of Boucheron combined diamonds with colorful other gemstones cut into the form of leaves, fruit or flowers, to make brooches, rings, earrings, clips and pendants. Far Eastern themes also became popular; plaques of jade and coral were combined with platinum and diamonds, and vanity cases, cigarette cases and powder boxes were decorated with Japanese and Chinese landscapes made with mother of pearl, enamel and lacquer.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=121-123}}

Rapidly changing fashions in clothing brought new styles of jewelry. Sleeveless dresses of the 1920s meant that arms needed decoration, and designers quickly created bracelets of gold, silver and platinum encrusted with lapis-lazuli, onyx, coral, and other colorful stones; Other bracelets were intended for the upper arms, and several bracelets were often worn at the same time. The short haircuts of women in the twenties called for elaborate deco earring designs. As women began to smoke in public, designers created very ornate cigarette cases and ivory cigarette holders. The invention of the wrist-watch before World War I inspired jewelers to create extraordinary decorated watches, encrusted with diamonds and plated with enamel, gold and silver. Pendant watches, hanging from a ribbon, also became fashionable.{{sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=125}}

The established jewelry houses of Paris in the period, Cartier, [[Chaumet]], Georges Fouquet, [[Mauboussin]], and [[Van Cleef &amp; Arpels]] all created jewelry and objects in the new fashion. The firm of Chaumet made highly geometric cigarette boxes, cigarette lighters, pillboxes and notebooks, made of hard stones decorated with [[jade]], [[lapis lazuli]], diamonds and sapphires. They were joined by many young new designers, each with his own idea of deco. [[Raymond Templier]] designed pieces with highly intricate geometric patterns, including silver earrings that looked like skyscrapers. [[Gerard Sandoz]] was only 18 when he started to design jewelry in 1921; he designed many celebrated pieces based on the smooth and polished look of modern machinery. The glass designer René Lalique also entered the field, creating pendants of fruit, flowers, frogs, fairies or mermaids made of sculpted glass in bright colors, hanging on cords of silk with tassels.{{sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=125}} The jeweler [[Paul Brandt]] contrasted rectangular and triangular patterns, and embedded pearls in lines on onyx plaques. [[Jean Despres]] made necklaces of contrasting colors by bringing together silver and black lacquer, or gold with lapis lazuli. Many of his designs looked like highly polished pieces of machines. [[Jean Dunand]] was also inspired by modern machinery, combined with bright reds and blacks contrasting with polished metal.{{sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=125}}

Like the Art Nouveau period before it, Art Deco was an exceptional period for fine glass and other decorative objects, designed to fit their architectural surroundings. The most famous producer of glass objects was René Lalique, whose works, from vases to hood ornaments for automobiles, became symbols of the period. He had made ventures into glass before World War I, designing bottles for the perfumes of [[François Coty]], but he did not begin serious production of art glass until after World War I. In 1918, at the age of 58, he bought a large glass works in Combs-la-Ville and began to manufacture both artistic and practical glass objects. He treated glass as a form of sculpture, and created statuettes, vases, bowls, lamps and ornaments. He used demi-crystal rather than lead crystal, which was softer and easier to form, though not as lustrous. He sometimes used colored glass, but more often used opalescent glass, where part or the whole of the outer surface was stained with a wash. Lalique provided the decorative glass panels, lights and illuminated glass ceilings for the ocean liners [[SS Ile de France|SS ''Ile de France'']] in 1927 and the SS ''Normandie'' in 1935, and for some of the first-class sleeping cars of the French railroads. At the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts, he had his own pavilion, designed a dining room with a table settling and matching glass ceiling for the Sèvres Pavilion, and designed a glass fountain for the courtyard of the Cours des Métier, a slender glass column which spouted water from the sides and was illuminated at night.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=245-250}}

Other notable Art Deco glass manufacturers included Marius-Ernest Sabino, who specialized in figurines, vases, bowls, and glass sculptures of fish, nudes, and animals. For these he often used an opalescent glass which could change from white to blue to amber, depending upon the light. His vases and bowls featured molded friezes of animals, nudes or busts of women with fruit or flowers. His work was less subtle but more colorful than that of Lalique.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=245-250}}

Other notable Deco glass designers included Edmond Etling, who also used bright opalescent colors, often with geometric patterns and sculpted nudes; Albert Simonet, and Aristide Colotte and [[Maurice Marinot]], who was known for his deeply etched sculptural bottles and vases. The firm of [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] from the city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], which had been famous for its Art Nouveau glass, produced a line of Deco vases and glass sculpture, solid, geometric and chunky in form. More delicate multicolored works were made by [[Gabriel Argy-Rousseau]], who produced delicately colored vases with sculpted butterflies and nymphs, and Francois Decorchemont, whose vases were streaked and marbled.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=245-250}}

The Great Depression ruined a large part of the decorative glass industry, which depended upon wealthy clients. Some artists turned to designing stained glass windows for churches. In 1937, the [[Steuben Glass Works|Steuben]] glass company began the practice of commissioning famous artists to produce glassware.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=245-250}} [[Louis Majorelle]], famous for his Art Nouveau furniture, designed a remarkable Art Deco stained glass window portraying steel workers for the offices of the [[Aciéries de Longwy]], a steel mill in [[Longwy]], France.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Art Deco artists produced a wide variety of practical objects in the Art Deco style, made of industrial materials from traditional wrought iron to chrome-plated steel. The American artist [[Norman Bel Geddes]] designed a cocktail set resembling a skyscraper made of chrome-plated steel. Raymond Subes designed an elegant metal grille for the entrance of the Palais de la Porte Dorée, the centerpiece of the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition.

==Art Deco architecture around the world==
Art Deco architecture began in Europe, but by 1939 there were examples in large cities on every continent and in almost every country. This is a selection of prominent buildings on each continent. (For a comprehensive of existing buildings by country, see [[List of Art Deco architecture]].)

A large number of the Art Deco buildings in Asia were designed by European architects, but in the Philippines local architect [[Juan Nakpil]] was preeminent. Many Art Deco landmarks in Asia were demolished during the great economic expansion of Asia the late 20th century, but some notable enclaves of the architecture still remain, particularly in [[Shanghai]] and [[Mumbai]].

Melbourne and Sydney Australia have several notable Art Deco buildings, including the [[Manchester Unity Building]] and the former [[Russell Street Police Headquarters]] in Melbourne, the Castlemaine Art Museum in [[Castlemaine, Victoria|Castlemaine]], central Victoria and the [[Grace Building (Sydney)|Grace Building,]] [[AWA Tower]] and [[ANZAC War Memorial]] in Sydney.

Several towns in New Zealand, including [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]] and [[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]] were rebuilt in Art Deco style after the [[1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake]], and many of the buildings have been protected and restored. Napier has been nominated for UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] status, the first cultural site in New Zealand to be nominated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artdeconapier.com/Earthquake_8.aspx |title=Napier Earthquake |publisher=Artdeconapier.com |date=3 February 1931 |accessdate=8 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706013856/http://www.artdeconapier.com/Earthquake_8.aspx |archivedate=6 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artdeconapier.com/ |title=Home – Art Deco Trust |publisher=Artdeconapier.com |accessdate=8 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630211317/http://www.artdeconapier.com/ |archivedate=30 June 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wellington]] has retained a sizeable number of Art Deco buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wellington.govt.nz/recreation/enjoy-the-outdoors/walks-and-walkways/across-the-city/art-deco-heritage-trail |title=Art Deco heritage trail |publisher=wellington.gov.nz |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, surviving Art Deco structures are mainly in the major cities; [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]], [[Hamilton, Ontario]], and [[Vancouver]]. They range from public buildings like [[Vancouver City Hall]] to commercial buildings ([[College Park (Toronto)|College Park]]) to public works ([[R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant]]).
File:Edificios La Nacional I y II.JPG | La Nacional Buildings [[Mexico City]], Mexico (1932)
In [[Mexico]], the most imposing Art Deco example is interior of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] (Palace of Fine Arts), finished in 1934 with its elaborate decor and murals. Examples of Art Deco residential architecture can be found in the [[Condesa]] neighborhood, many designed by [[Francisco J. Serrano]].

In the United States, Art Deco buildings are found from coast to coast, in all the major cities. It was most widely used for office buildings, train stations, airport terminals, and movie theaters; residential buildings are rare. In the 1930s, the more austere streamline style became popular. Many buildings were demolished between 1945 and the late 1960s, but then efforts began to protect the best examples. The City of Miami Beach established the [[Miami Beach Architectural District]] to preserve the colorful collection of Art Deco buildings found there.

The architectural style first appeared in Paris with the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées (1910–13) by Auguste Perret but then spread rapidly around Europe, until examples could be found in nearly every large city, from London to Moscow. In Germany two variations of Art Deco flourished in the 1920s and 30s: The [[New Objectivity (architecture)|Neue Sachlichkeit]] style and [[Expressionist architecture]]. Notable examples include Erich Mendelsohn's Mossehaus and [[Schaubühne]] theater in [[Berlin]], [[Fritz Höger]]'s [[Chilehaus]] in [[Hamburg]] and his [[Kirche am Hohenzollernplatz]] in Berlin, the Anzeiger Tower in [[Hannover]] and the Borsig Tower in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Kathleen|title=Erich Mendelsohn and the Architecture of German Modernism|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521571685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest Art Deco buildings in Western Europe is the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Brussels|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] in Koekelberg, Brussels. In 1925, architect Albert van Huffel won the Grand Prize for Architecture with his scale model of the basilica at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basilicakoekelberg.be/documents/home.xml?lang=en |title=Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Koekelberg |publisher=Basilicakoekelberg.be |date=8 March 2011 |accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain and Portugal have some striking examples of Art Deco buildings, particularly movie theaters. Examples in Portugal are the Capitólio Theater (1931) and the Éden Cine-Theater (1937) in [[Lisbon]], the [[Rivoli Theatre (Portugal)|Rivoli Theater]] (1937) and the [[Coliseu do Porto|Coliseu]] (1941) in [[Porto]] and the Rosa Damasceno Theater (1937) in [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]]. An example in Spain is the Cine Rialto in Valencia (1939).

During the 1930s, Art Deco had a noticeable effect on house design in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name="Art Deco Style" /&gt; as well as the design of various public buildings.&lt;ref name="Design Handbook" /&gt; Straight, white-rendered house frontages rising to flat roofs, sharply geometric door surrounds and tall windows, as well as convex-curved metal corner windows, were all characteristic of that period.&lt;ref name="Art Deco (1920s to 1930s)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london-footprints.co.uk/artdecobldgs.htm |title=Art Deco Buildings |year=2007 |publisher=london-footprints.co.uk |accessdate=6 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211074839/http://www.london-footprints.co.uk/artdecobldgs.htm |archivedate=11 December 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art-deco-classics.co.uk/frinton_artdeco.php |title=Art Deco in Frinton on sea |year=2006 |publisher=Art Deco Classics |accessdate=6 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201132519/http://www.art-deco-classics.co.uk/frinton_artdeco.php |archivedate=1 December 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[London Underground]] is famous for many examples of Art Deco architecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00npm4g/Art_Deco_Icons_London_Transport |title=Four Programmes – Art Deco Icons |publisher=BBC |date=14 November 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are a number of buildings in the style situated along the [[Golden Mile (Brentford)|Golden Mile]] in Brentford. Also in West London is the Hoover Building, which was originally built for [[The Hoover Company]] and was converted into a superstore in the early 1990s.

===India===
{{See also|Art Deco in Mumbai}}

The Indian Institute of Architects, founded in Bombay in 1929, played a prominent role in propagating the Art Deco movement. In November 1937, this institute organized the ‘Ideal Home Exhibition’ held in the Town Hall in Bombay which spanned over 12 days and attracted about one hundred thousand visitors. As a result, it was declared a success by the 'Journal of the Indian Institute of Architects'. The exhibits displayed the ‘ideal’, or better described as the most ‘modern’ arrangements for various parts of the house, paying close detail to avoid architectural blunders and present the most efficient and well-thought-out models. The exhibition focused on various elements of a home ranging from furniture, elements of interior decoration as well as radios and refrigerators using new and scientifically relevant materials and methods.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mumbai Fables|last=Prakash|first=Gyan|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780691142845|location=|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Guided by their desire to emulate the west, the Indian architects were fascinated by the industrial modernity that Art Deco offered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The western elites were the first to experiment with the technologically advanced facets of Art Deco, and architects began the process of transformation by the early 1930s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bombay’s expanding port commerce in the 1930s resulted in the growth of educated middle class population. It also saw an increase of people migrating to Bombay in search of job opportunities. This led to the pressing need for new developments through Land Reclamation Schemes and construction of new public and residential buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33153751|title=Bombay : the cities within|last=Sharada.|first=Dwivedi,|date=1995|publisher=India Book House|others=Mehrotra, Rahul., Mulla-Feroze, Umaima.|isbn=818502880X|location=Bombay|oclc=33153751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallelly, the changing political climate in the country and the aspirational quality of the Art Deco aesthetics led to a whole-hearted acceptance of the building style in the city’s development. Most of the buildings from this period can be seen spread throughout the city neighbourhoods in areas such as Churchgate, Colaba, Fort, Mohammed Ali Road, Cumbala Hill, Dadar, Matunga, Bandra and Chembur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/300923025|title=Bombay Deco|last=Sharada.|first=Dwivedi,|date=2008|publisher=Eminence Designs|others=Mehrotra, Rahul., Gobhai, Noshir.|year=|isbn=8190382152|location=Mumbai|pages=|oclc=300923025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artdecomumbai.com/inventory/|title=Inventory {{!}} Art Deco|website=www.artdecomumbai.com|language=en-US|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art Deco in South America is present especially at the countries that received a great wave of immigration on the first half of the 20th century, with notable works at their richest cities, like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in [[Brazil]] and Buenos Aires in [[Argentina]].The [[Kavanagh building]] in [[Buenos Aires]] (1934), by Sánchez, Lagos and de la Torre, was the tallest reinforced concrete structure when it was completed, and a notable example of late Art Deco style.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In many cities, efforts have been made to protect the remaining Art Deco buildings. In many U.S. cities, historic art deco movie theaters have been preserved and turned into cultural centers. Even more modest art deco buildings have been preserved as part of America's architectural heritage; an art deco cafe and gas station along Route 66 in Shamrock, Texas is an historic monument. The Miami Beach Architectural District protects several hundred old buildings, and requires that new buildings comply with the style. In [[Havana]], Cuba, a large number of Art Deco buildings have badly deteriorated. Efforts are underway to bring the buildings back to their original color and appearance.

In the 21st century, modern variants of Art Deco, called Neo Art Deco (or Neo-Art Deco), have appeared in some American cities, inspired by the classic Art Deco buildings of the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name="Capitman"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?isbn=0525934421 Barbara B.

'''Artificial Intelligence System''' ('''AIS''') was a [[distributed computing]] project undertaken by Intelligence Realm, Inc. with the long-term goal of simulating the human brain in real time, complete with [[artificial consciousness]] and [[artificial general intelligence]]. They claimed to have found, in research, the "mechanisms of knowledge representation in the brain which is equivalent to finding artificial intelligence",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ovguide.com/artificial-intelligence-system-9202a8c04000641f8000000007b55d02# |title=Artificial Intelligence System Video |publisher=OVGuide.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; before moving into the developmental phase.

==Science==
The project's initial goal was recreating the largest brain simulation to date, performed by neuroscientist [[Eugene M. Izhikevich]] of The Neurosciences Institute in [[San Diego, California]]. Izhikevich simulated 1 second of activity of 100 billion neurons (the estimated number of neurons in the human brain) in 50 days using a [[Cluster (computing)|cluster]] of 27 3-gigahertz processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eugene Izhikevich |url=http://www.izhikevich.org/human_brain_simulation/Blue_Brain.htm#Computer%20Model%20of%20the%20Human%20Brain |title=Computer Model of the Human Brain |publisher=Vesicle.nsi.edu |date=2005-10-27 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He extrapolated that a real-time simulation of the brain could not be achieved before 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.izhikevich.org/human_brain_simulation/why.htm|title=why did I do that? |publisher=Vesicle.nsi.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project aimed to disprove this prediction.

On July 12, 2008, AIS announced that the first phase of the project had been completed by reaching the 100 billion neuron mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-age.com/channels/development-and-integration/perspectives-and-trends/1053102/the-distributed-brain.thtml |title=The distributed brain |publisher=Information-age.com |date=2009-06-17 |accessdate=2011-06-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110720194758/http://www.information-age.com/channels/development-and-integration/perspectives-and-trends/1053102/the-distributed-brain.thtml| archivedate= 20 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project then continued to simulate neurons while they completed the development of the other applications.

AIS simulated the brain via an [[artificial neural network]], and used [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]]s. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The project utilized the [[BOINC]] distributed computing platform. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In version 1.08 of the software each work unit received by a volunteer simulated 500,000 [[neuron]]s for 100 milliseconds at 5 millisecond time steps (the estimated firing rate of a human neuron).{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The application had four primary modules—for creating neurons, simulating neurons, visualizing neurons, and finally, knowledge acquisition. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Intention was that the neuronal generator would eventually use [[genetic algorithms]] to generate neurons for simulation. The neuron simulator used mathematical models to simulate those neurons. Initially Hodgkin–Huxley models were used, but more models (perhaps hundreds) were intended to be utilized in the future. The visualization software was to allow the administrators to monitor and control the neuronal simulators. The knowledge acquisition module involved feeding information to the system and training it to build its knowledge base.

The AIS project had successfully simulated over 700 billion neurons by April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;"The distributed brain"&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was closed in November 2010 as the BOINC program of the project did not work.

In European [[architectural sculpture]], an '''atlas''' (also known as an '''atlant''', or '''atlante'''&lt;ref&gt; Hersey, George,  The Lost Meaning of Classical Architecture,  MIT Press, Cambridge, MA,  1998 p. 129 &lt;/ref&gt;  or '''atlantid'''; plural '''atlantes''')&lt;ref name="atlex"&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Aru.html ''Aru-Az'''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704103828/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Aru.html |date=2008-07-04 }}, Michael Delahunt, [http://www.artlex.com/ ArtLex Art Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424084418/http://www.artlex.com/ |date=2005-04-24 }}, 1996–2008.&lt;/ref&gt; is a support sculpted in the form of a man, which may take the place of a [[column]], a [[Pier (architecture)|pier]] or a [[pilaster]]. The Roman term for such a sculptural support is a telamon (plural '''''telamones''''' or telamons).&lt;ref name="atlex" /&gt;

The term ''atlantes'' is the Greek plural of the name [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]—the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] who was forced to hold the sky on his shoulders for eternity. The alternative term, ''telamones'', also is derived from a later mythological hero, [[Telamon]], one of the [[Argonauts]], who was the father of [[Telamonian Aias|Ajax]]. 

The [[caryatid]] is the female precursor of this architectural form in Greece, a woman standing in the place of each column or pillar. Caryatids are found at the treasuries at [[Delphi]] and the [[Erechtheion]] on the Acropolis at Athens for Athene. They usually are in an [[Ionic order|Ionic context]] and represented a ritual association with the goddesses worshiped within.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Cyril M., ed., ''Illustrated Dictionary of Historic Architecture'', Dover Publications, New York,  1983.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Atalante is typically life-size or larger; smaller similar figures in the decorative arts are called [[Term (architecture)|terms]].  The body of many Atalantes turns into a rectangular pillar or other architectural feature around the waist level, a feature borrowed from the term.  The pose and expression of Alalantes very often show their effort to bear the heavy load of the building, which is rarely the case with terms and caryatids.  The [[herma]] or herm is a classical boundary marker or wayside monument to a god which is usually a square pillar with only a carved head on top, about life-size, and male genitals at the appropriate mid-point. Figures that are rightly called Atalantes may sometimes be described as herms.

Atlantes express extreme effort in their function, heads bent forward to support the weight of the structure above them across their shoulders, forearms often lifted to provide additional support, providing an architectural motif.  Atlantes and caryatids were noted by the Roman late Republican architect [[Vitruvius]], whose description of the structures,&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius, ''De Architectura'', 6.7.6.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than surviving examples, transmitted the idea of atlantes to the Renaissance architectural vocabulary.

==Origin==
Not only did the Caryatids precede them, but similar architectural figures already had been made in [[ancient Egypt]] out of [[monolith]]s. Atlantes originated in Greek Sicily and in [[Magna Graecia]], southern Italy. The [[:Image:Agrigento Telamon.jpg|earliest surviving atlantes]] are fallen ones from the Early Classical [[Greek temple]] of Zeus, the ''Olympeion'', in [[Agrigento]], Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phdiva.blogspot.com/2008/05/vitruvius-caryatids-and-telamones.html Dorothy King, "Doric Figured Supports: Vitruvius’ Caryatids and Atlantes: 5.2 Atlantes and Telamones"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Atlantes, however, have played a more significant role in [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] and [[baroque architecture]]. 

During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, many buildings were built with glorious atlantes that look much like the Greek ones. Their selection from the two proposed designs&amp;mdash;the other design using Caryatids&amp;mdash;for the entrance of the [[Hermitage Museum]] that was built for Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] made atlantes become even more fashionable. The portico of this building has ten enormous atlantes, approximately three times life-size, carved from [[Sortavala|Serdobol granite]], which were designed by [[Johann Halbig]] and executed by the sculptor, [[Alexander Terebenev]].

==Mesoamerica==
Similar carved stone columns or pillars in the shape of fierce men at some sites of Pre-Columbian [[Mesoamerica]] are typically called [[Atlantean figures]].  These figures are considered to be "massive statues of [[Toltec]] warriors".&lt;ref name="Evans-p42"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Susan|title=Ancient Mexico and Central America: Archaeology and Culture History|year=2008|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5390">In (unconstrained) [[optimization (mathematics)|minimization]], a '''backtracking line search''', a search scheme based on the '''Armijo–Goldstein condition''', is a [[line search]] method to determine the maximum amount to move along a given search direction. It involves starting with a relatively large estimate of the step size for movement along the search direction, and iteratively shrinking the step size (i.e., "backtracking") until a decrease of the [[objective function]] is observed that adequately corresponds to the decrease that is expected, based on the local gradient of the objective function.

==Motivation==
Given a starting position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; and a [[Descent direction|search direction]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;, the task of a line search is to determine a step size &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; that adequately reduces the objective function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; (assumed [[smooth function|smooth]]), i.e., to find a value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; that reduces &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x}+\alpha\,\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt; relative to &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;. However, it is usually undesirable to devote substantial resources to finding a value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; to precisely minimize &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. This is because the computing resources needed to find a more precise minimum along one particular direction could instead be employed to identify a better search direction. Once an improved starting point has been identified by the line search, another subsequent line search will ordinarily be performed in a new direction. The goal, then, is just to identify a value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; that provides a reasonable amount of improvement in the objective function, rather than to find the actual minimizing value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

The backtracking line search starts with a large estimate of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and iteratively shrinks it. The shrinking continues until a value is found that is small enough to provide a decrease in the objective function that adequately matches the decrease that is expected to be achieved, based on the local function gradient &lt;math&gt;\nabla f(\mathbf{x})\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Define the local slope of the function of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; along the search direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;m = \mathbf{p}^{\mathrm T}\,\nabla f(\mathbf{x})\,.&lt;/math&gt; It is assumed that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector in a direction in which some local decrease is possible, i.e., it is assumed that &lt;math&gt;m &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Based on a selected control parameter &lt;math&gt;c\,\in\,(0,1)&lt;/math&gt;, the Armijo–Goldstein condition tests whether a step-wise movement from a current position
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; to a modified position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}+\alpha\,\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; achieves an adequately corresponding decrease in the objective function. The  condition is fulfilled if &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x}+\alpha\,\mathbf{p})\leq f(\mathbf{x})+\alpha\,c\,m\,.&lt;/math&gt;

This condition, when used appropriately as part of a line search, can ensure that the step size is not excessively large. However, this condition is not sufficient on its own to ensure that the step size is nearly optimal, since any value of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \alpha&lt;/math&gt; that is sufficiently small will satisfy the condition.

Thus, the backtracking line search strategy starts with a relatively large step size, and repeatedly shrinks it by a factor &lt;math&gt;\tau\,\in\,(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; until the Armijo–Goldstein condition is fulfilled.

The search will terminate after a finite number of steps for any positive values of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; that are less than 1.  For example, Armijo used {{fraction|1|2}} for both &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; in a paper he published in 1966.

==Algorithm==
Starting with a maximum candidate step size value &lt;math&gt;\alpha_0&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt;, using search control parameters &lt;math&gt;\tau\,\in\,(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c\,\in\,(0,1)&lt;/math&gt;, the backtracking line search algorithm can be expressed as follows:
# Set &lt;math&gt;t = -c\,m&lt;/math&gt; and iteration counter &lt;math&gt;j\,=\,0&lt;/math&gt;.
# Until the condition is satisfied that &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x})-f(\mathbf{x}+\alpha_j\,\mathbf{p})\geq \alpha_j\,t,&lt;/math&gt; repeatedly increment &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; and set &lt;math&gt;\alpha_j=\tau\,\alpha_{j-1}\,.&lt;/math&gt; 
# Return &lt;math&gt;\alpha_j&lt;/math&gt; as the solution.

In other words, reduce &lt;math&gt;\alpha_0&lt;/math&gt; by a factor of &lt;math&gt;\tau\,&lt;/math&gt; in each iteration until the Armijo–Goldstein condition is fulfilled.

The '''Basque Center of Applied Mathematics''' (BCAM) is a research center on applied mathematics, created with the support of the Basque Government and the University of the Basque Country. The BCAM headquarters are in Alda. Mazarredo, 14  in [[Bilbao]], the capital of the province  of [[Biscay]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] of northern [[Spain]].

==Background==
In January 2007, the Department of Education, Universities and Research of the [[Basque Government]] [http://www.hezkuntza.ejgv.euskadi.net/r43-2591/es/] set up [[Ikerbasque]], the Basque Foundation for Science, which was charged with three objectives: the attraction and recovery of front-rank, consolidated researchers; the creation of new research centers with standards of excellence, and social outreach for science. The creation and current activity of BCAM – the Basque Center for Applied Mathematics - fall within the framework of the second of these objectives.

In early 2008, [[Ikerbasque]] commissioned [[Enrique Zuazua]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieeecss.org/CSM/library/2011/oct2011/w12-PeopleinControlPart1.pdf ieeecs interview]&lt;/ref&gt; to carry out a prospective study on the viability of setting up a center for mathematical research in the Basque Country. In March, 2008, the Ikerbasque Board of Trustees decided to go ahead with the creation of such a center as part of the BERC program (Basque Excellent Research Centres), later to become known as BCAM – Basque Center for Applied Mathematics. At the same time, the first international call for submissions for posts of director, managers and scientists was made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euskadi.net/cgi-bin_k54/bopv_20?c&amp;f=20081230&amp;a=200807222 Official call of BERC Program]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euskadi.net/cgi-bin_k54/bopv_20?c&amp;f=20090724&amp;a=200904226 Official centers grantees list]&lt;/ref&gt;

The center is located in the province of [[Biscay]], given the extensive industrial fabric that the region has had traditionally as well as its current development of R+D+i activities.
BCAM was officially created as a non-profit Association on September 1, 2008, and backed by the following three institutions: Ikerbasque, the [[University of the Basque Country]] (UPV-EHU), [[Innobasque]], the Basque Foundation for Innovation and The [[Biscay]] Government.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1312">'''Bulliform cells''' are large, bubble-shaped [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermal cells]] that occur in groups on the upper surface of the leaves of many monocots.These cells are present on the adaxial or the upper surface of the leaf. They are generally present near the mid vein. These cells are large, empty and colourless.

The mechanism of working of bulliform cells can be explained as:

During [[drought]], the loss of water through [[vacuoles]] induces the reduced bulliform cells to allow the leaves of many grass species to close as the two edges of the grass blade fold up toward each other. Once adequate water is available, these cells enlarge and the leaves are forced open again.

Folded leaves offer less exposure to sunlight, so they are heated less thus reducing evaporation and conserving the remaining water in the plant. Bulliform cells occur on the leaves of a wide variety of monocotyledon families but are probably best known in grasses. They are thought to play a role in the unfolding of developing leaves and in the rolling and unrolling of mature leaves in response to alternating wet and dry periods.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, R. et al.

Animals that are held by humans and prevented from escaping are said to be in '''captivity'''.&lt;ref&gt;Definitions, 1911 CHAPTER 27 1 and 2 Geo 5; "...the expression “captive animal” means any animal (not being a domestic animal) of whatsoever kind or species, and whether a quadruped or not, including any bird, fish, or reptile, which is in captivity, or confinement, or which is maimed, pinioned, or subjected to any appliance or contrivance for the purpose of hindering or preventing its escape from captivity or confinement..."; Protection of Animals Act 1911; http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/1-2/27&lt;/ref&gt; The term is usually applied to wild animals that are held in confinement, but may also be used generally to describe the keeping of [[domesticate]]d [[animal]]s such as [[livestock]] or [[pet]]s. This may include, for example, animals in [[farm]]s, private homes, [[zoo]]s and laboratories. Animal captivity may be categorized according to the particular motives, objectives and conditions of the confinement.

==History==

Throughout history not only domestic animals as pets and [[livestock]] were kept in captivity and under human care, but also wild animals. Some were failed domestication attempts. Also, in past times, primarily the wealthy, [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] and kings collected wild animals for various reasons. Contrary to domestication, the ferociousness and natural behaviour of the wild animals were preserved and exhibited. Today's zoos claim other reasons for keeping animals under human care: [[conservation biology|conservation]], [[education]] and [[science]].

[[Image:Mexican wolf lounging.jpg|right|thumb|An [[endangered]] [[Mexican wolf|Mexican gray wolf]] is kept in captivity for breeding purposes.]]

== Behavior of animals in captivity ==
Captive animals, especially those not domesticated, sometimes develop [[List of abnormal behaviours in animals|abnormal behaviours]].

One type of abnormal behaviour is ''[[stereotypical behavior]]s'', i.e. repetitive and apparently purposeless motor behaviors. Examples of stereotypical behaviours include pacing, self-injury, route tracing and excessive self-grooming. These behaviors are associated with stress and lack of stimulation. Many who keep animals in captivity attempt to prevent or decrease stereotypical behavior by introducing stimuli, a process known as [[Behavioral enrichment|environmental enrichment]].

A type of abnormal behavior shown in captive animals is self-injurious behavior (SIB). Self-injurious behavior indicates any activity that involves biting, scratching, hitting, hair plucking, or [[eye poke]] that may result in injuring oneself.&lt;ref name=Rommeck&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rommeck |first1=Ina |first2=Kristen |last2=Anderson |first3=Allison |last3=Heagerty |first4=Ashley |last4=Cameron |first5=Brenda |last5=McCowan |title=Risk factors and remediation of self-injurious and self-abuse behavior in rhesus macaques |journal=Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science |year=2009 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=61–72 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10888700802536798 |doi=10.1080/10888700802536798|pmc=4443667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although its reported incidence is low, self-injurious behavior is observed across a range of primate species, especially when they experience [[social isolation]] in infancy.&lt;ref name=Hosey&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hosey |first1=Geoff R. |first2=Lindsay J. |last2=Skyner |title=Self-injurious behavior in zoo primates |journal=International Journal of Primatology |year=2007 |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=1431–1437 |doi=10.1007/s10764-007-9203-z |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10764-007-9203-z |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-bite involves biting one’s own body—typically the arms, legs, shoulders, or genitals. Threat bite involves biting one’s own body—typically the hand, wrist, or forearm—while staring at the observer, conspecific, or mirror in a threatening manner. Self-hit involves striking oneself on any part of the body. Eye poking is a behavior (widely observed in [[primates]]) that presses the knuckle or finger into the orbital space above the eye socket. [[Hair plucking]] is a jerking motion applied to one’s own hair with hands or teeth, resulting in its excessive removal.&lt;ref name=Rommeck/&gt;

The proximal causes of self-injurious behavior have been widely studied in captive [[primates]]; either social or nonsocial factors can trigger this type of behavior. Social factors include changes in group composition, stress, separation from the group, approaches by or aggression from members of other groups, [[conspecific]] male individuals nearby, separation from females, and removal from the group.&lt;ref name=Hosey/&gt; [[Social isolation]], particularly disruptions of early mother-rearing experiences, is an important risk factor.&lt;ref name=Rommeck/&gt; Studies have suggested that, although mother-reared [[rhesus macaques]] still exhibit some self-injurious behaviors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J. |last1=Erwin |first2=G. |last2=Mitchell |first3=Terry |last3=Maple |title=Abnormal behavior in non-isolate-reared rhesus monkeys |journal=Psychological Reports |year=1973 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=515–523 |url=http://www.amsciepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pr0.1973.33.2.515 |doi=10.2466/pr0.1973.33.2.515}}&lt;/ref&gt; nursery-reared rhesus macaques are much more likely to self-abuse than mother-reared ones.&lt;ref name=Rommeck/&gt; Nonsocial factors include the presence of a small cut, a wound or irritant, cold weather, human contact, and frequent zoo visitors.&lt;ref name=Hosey/&gt; For example, a study has shown that zoo visitor density positively correlates with the number of gorillas banging on the barrier, and that low zoo visitor density caused gorillas to behave in a more relaxed way. Captive animals often cannot escape the attention and disruption caused by the general public, and the stress resulting from this lack of environmental control may lead to an increased rate of self-injurious behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wells |first=Deborah L. |title=A note on the influence of visitors on the behavior and welfare of zoo-housed gorillas |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |year=2005 |volume=93 |issue=1-2 |pages=13–17 |url=http://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591(05)00181-4/pdf |doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2005.06.019 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On top of self inflicted harm, some animals exhibit harm towards others and internal psychological harm. This can be exhibited in various forma, such as Orca whales, which never have killed a human in the wild, killing two of its own trainers. Psychological tics can also be identified, ranging from swaying to head bobbing to pacing. Continuous inbreeding is also bringing out mental disadvantages, such as crossed eyes and infertility.

Studies suggest that many abnormal captive behaviors, including [[Self-injurious behavior#Other animals|self-injurious behavior]], can be successfully treated by pair housing. Pair housing provides a previously single-housed animal with a same-sex social partner;&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Kate C. |first2=Mollie A. |last2=Bloomsmith |first3=Brooke |last3=Oettinger |first4=Kimberly |last4=Neu |first5=Caroline |last5=Griffis |first6=Valérie |last6=Schoof |first7=Margaret |last7=Maloney |title=Benefits of pair housing are consistent across a diverse population of rhesus macaques |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |year=2012 |volume=137 |issue=3-4 |pages=148–156 |doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2011.09.010 |url=http://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591(11)00304-2/pdf |subscription=yes|pmc=4307811 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this method is especially effective with primates, which are widely known to be [[social animals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J.L. |last=Weed |first2=P.O. |last2=Wagner |first3=R. |last3=Byrum |first4=S. |last4=Parrish |first5=M. |last5=Knezevich |first6=D.A. |last6=Powell |title=Treatment of persistent self-injurious behavior in rhesus monkeys through socialization: A preliminary report |journal=Contemporary Topics in Laboratory Animal Science |year=2003 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=21–23 |pmid=14510519 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social companionship provided by pair housing encourages social interaction, thus reducing abnormal and anxiety-related behavior in captive animals as well as increasing their [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]].&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;

Careful selection of chemotactic component of the ligand not only the [[chemoattractant]] character could be expended, however, [[chemorepellent]] ligands are also valuable as they are useful to keep away cell populations degrading the conjugate containing the drug.

This mechanism of drug delivery is currently being studied.

{{Sociology}}

'''Comparative sociology''' involves comparison of the social processes between [[nation states]], or across different types of society (for example [[capitalism|capitalist]] and [[socialist]]). There are two main approaches to comparative sociology: some seek similarity across different countries and cultures whereas others seek variance.  For example, [[structural Marxists]] have attempted to use comparative methods to discover the general processes that underlie apparently different social orderings in different societies.  The danger of this approach is that the different social contexts are overlooked in the search for supposed universal structures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/910157494|title=A dictionary of sociology|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Scott, John, 1949-|isbn=9780191763052|edition= Fourth|location=Oxford|oclc=910157494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One sociologist who employed comparative methods to understand variance was [[Max Weber]], whose studies attempted to show how differences between cultures explained the different social orderings that had emerged (see for example ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' and [[Sociology of religion]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is some debate within sociology regarding whether the label of 'comparative' is suitable. [[Emile Durkheim]] argued in ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' (1895) that all sociological research was in fact comparative since social phenomenon are always held to be typical, representative or unique, all of which imply some sort of comparison. In this sense, all sociological analysis is comparative and it has been suggested that what is normally referred to as comparative research, may be more appropriately called [[cross-national research]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7283">'''Computational RAM''' or '''C-RAM''' is [[random-access memory]] with [[Central processing unit|processing elements]] integrated on the same chip.  This enables C-RAM to be used as a [[SIMD]] computer. It also can be used to more efficiently use memory bandwidth within a memory chip.

==Overview==
The most influential implementations of computational RAM came from [[The Berkeley IRAM Project]]. Vector IRAM (V-IRAM) combines [[DRAM]] with a [[vector processor]] integrated on the same chip.&lt;ref name="kozyrakis"&gt;

says
"Vector IRAM ...
can operate as a parallel built-in self-test engine for
the memory array, significantly reducing the DRAM
testing time and the associated cost."
&lt;/ref&gt;

Reconfigurable Architecture DRAM (RADram) is [[DRAM]] with [[reconfigurable computing]] [[FPGA]] logic elements integrated on the same chip.&lt;ref name="oskin"&gt;

[http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~chong/papers/AP-isca98.pdf "Active Pages: A Computation Model for Intelligent Memory"].
1998.
&lt;/ref&gt;
SimpleScalar simulations show that RADram (in a system with a conventional processor) can give orders of magnitude better performance on some problems than traditional DRAM (in a system with the same processor).

Some [[embarrassingly parallel]] computational problems are already limited by the [[von Neumann bottleneck]] between the CPU and the DRAM.
Some researchers expect that, for the same total cost, a machine built from computational RAM will run orders of magnitude faster than a traditional general-purpose computer on these kinds of problems.&lt;ref&gt;

"programming a computational RAM"
&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, the "DRAM process" (few layers; optimized for high capacitance) and the "CPU process" (optimized for high frequency; typically twice as many [[BEOL]] layers as DRAM; since each additional layer reduces yield and increases manufacturing cost, such chips are relatively expensive per square millimeter compared to DRAM) is distinct enough that there are three approaches to computational RAM:

* starting with a CPU-optimized process and a device that uses lots of embedded SRAM, add an additional process step (making it even more expensive per square millimeter) to allow replacing the embedded SRAM with embedded DRAM ([[eDRAM]]), giving ~3x area savings on the SRAM areas (and so lowering net cost per chip).
* starting with a system with a separate CPU chip and DRAM chip(s), add small amounts of "coprocessor" computational ability to the DRAM, working within the limits of the DRAM process and adding only small amounts of area to the DRAM, to do things that would otherwise be slowed down by the narrow bottleneck between CPU and DRAM: zero-fill selected areas of memory, copy large blocks of data from one location to another, find where (if anywhere) a given byte occurs in some block of data, etc. The resulting system—the unchanged CPU chip, and "smart DRAM" chip(s)—is at least as fast as the original system, and potentially slightly lower in cost. The cost of the small amount of extra area is expected to be more than paid back in savings in expensive test time, since there is now enough computational capability on a "smart DRAM" for a wafer full of DRAM to do most testing internally in parallel, rather than the traditional approach of fully testing one DRAM chip at a time with an expensive external [[automatic test equipment]].&lt;ref name="kozyrakis" /&gt;
* starting with a DRAM-optimized process, tweak the process to make it slightly more like the "CPU process", and build a (relatively low-frequency, but low-power and very high bandwidth) general-purpose CPU within the limits of that process.

Some CPUs designed to be built on a DRAM process technology (rather than a "CPU" or "logic" process technology specifically optimized for CPUs) include

and the [[AT&amp;T DSP1]].

Because a memory bus to off-chip memory has many times the capacitance of an on-chip memory bus, a system with separate DRAM and CPU chips can have several times the [[low-power electronics|energy consumption]] of an IRAM system with the same [[computer performance]].
&lt;ref name="kozyrakis" /&gt;

Because computational DRAM is expected to run hotter than traditional DRAM,
and increased chip temperatures result in faster charge leakage from the DRAM storage cells,
computational DRAM is expected to require more frequent [[memory refresh|DRAM refresh]].

== Processor-in-/near-memory ==

{{refimprove|section|date=August 2012}}

A '''processor-in-/near-memory (PINM)''' refers to a [[CPU|computer processor]] (CPU) tightly coupled to [[computer memory|memory]], generally on the same [[Integrated circuit|silicon chip]].

The chief goal of merging the processing and memory components in this way is to reduce [[memory latency]] and increase [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]]. Alternatively reducing the distance that data needs to be moved reduces the power requirements of a system. Much of the complexity (and hence [[power consumption]]) in current processors stems from strategies to deal with avoiding memory stalls.

==Examples==
In the 1980s, a tiny CPU that executed [[FORTH]] was fabricated into a [[DRAM]] chip to improve PUSH and POP.  [[FORTH]] is a [[stack-oriented programming language]] and this improved its efficiency.

The [[transputer]] also had large on chip memory given that it was made in the early 1980s making it essentially a processor-in-memory.

Notable PIM projects include the [[Berkeley IRAM project]] (IRAM) at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://iram.cs.berkeley.edu/ IRAM]&lt;/ref&gt; project and the [[University of Notre Dame]] PIM&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cse.nd.edu/~pim PIM]&lt;/ref&gt; effort.

'''The Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine''' is an international instrument aiming to prohibit the misuse of innovations in [[biomedicine]] and to protect human [[dignity]]. The Convention was opened for signature on 4 April 1997 in [[Oviedo, Spain]] and is thus otherwise known as the '''Oviedo Convention'''. The International [[treaty]] is a manifestation of the effort on the part of the [[Council of Europe]] to keep pace with developments in the field of biomedicine; it is notably the first multilateral binding instrument entirely devoted to biolaw.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/457872/The_Oviedo_Convention_a_European_Legal_Framework_at_the_Intersection_of_Human_Rights_and_Health_Law Roberto Andorno, ''The Oviedo Convention: A European Legal Framework at the Intersection of Human Rights and Health Law,'' JIBL Vol 02, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention entered into force on 1 December 1999.

==Characteristics==
The Convention provides a framework structure to preserve human dignity comprehensively across the field of [[bioethics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eubios.info/EJ123/ej123d.htm Ismini Kriari-Cataris, ''The Convention for the protection of human rights and dignity of the human being with regard to the application of biology and medicine: Convention on human rights and biomedicine,'' Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences Athens, Greece, Journal of Asian and International Bioethics, 12 (2002) 90-93]&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is shaped around the premise that there is a fundamental connection between human rights and biomedicine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/457872/The_Oviedo_Convention_a_European_Legal_Framework_at_the_Intersection_of_Human_Rights_and_Health_Law Roberto Andorno, ''The Oviedo Convention: A European Legal Framework at the Intersection of Human Rights and Health Law,'' JIBL Vol 02, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; A minimum common standard is created by the Convention and allows states to legislate for a greater degree of protection upon ratification (''Article 27''). In addition, judicial protection is conferred on the national courts. Therefore, there is no basis on which an individual can bring an action in relation to the Oviedo Convention alone. The Convention may only be referenced in conjunction with proceedings brought in respect of a violation of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. Absence of any provisions for a judicial procedure from the convention is considered to be a major weakness of the Oviedo Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gr2tq4rz9x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=The+Convention+on+Human+Rights+and+Biomedicine%3A+An+appraisal+of+the+Council+of+Europe+Convention&amp;rft.jtitle=European+Journal+of+Health+Law&amp;rft.au=Roscam+Abbing%2C+H.D.C&amp;rft.date=1998&amp;rft.issn=0929-0273&amp;rft.eissn=1571-8093&amp;rft.volume=5&amp;rft.issue=4&amp;rft.spage=377&amp;rft.epage=387&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1163%2F15718099820522588&amp;rft.externalDBID=n%2Fa&amp;rft.externalDocID=29051894&amp;paramdict=en-NZ Henriette Roscam Abbing, ''The Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine. An Appraisal of the Council of Europe Convention'', European Journal of Health Law, 1998, no.5, p.379]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==History==
The rate of advancement in biomedicine caused concern to the Council of Europe that as much as development in this field instilled hope for mankind, it also posed a threat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report]&lt;/ref&gt; It became the objective of the Council of Europe to set out common general standards for the protection of the dignity of the human person in relation to biomedical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report]&lt;/ref&gt;  A draft convention was requested by the Steering Committee on Bioethics (CDBI)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dg3/healthbioethic/cdbi/default_en.asp Committee on Bioethics]&lt;/ref&gt; and drafted by its Working Group in July 1992. The draft convention underwent public consultation in July 1994, adopted by the Committee of Ministers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/cm/home_en.asp Committee of Ministers]&lt;/ref&gt; in November 1996, and finally opened for signature on 4 April 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/457872/The_Oviedo_Convention_a_European_Legal_Framework_at_the_Intersection_of_Human_Rights_and_Health_Law Roberto Andorno, ''The Oviedo Convention: A European Legal Framework at the Intersection of Human Rights and Health Law,'' JIBL Vol 02, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parties to the Convention==
35 states have signed the ‘’’Oviedo Convention’'' since it was opened for signature in 1997, however only 29 of these states have signed and ratified the convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/164/signatures|title=Parties to the Oviedo Convention|last=|first=|date=|website=Treaty Office|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that only 29 states have implemented the principles of the instrument into their national law. Furthermore, 6 of those ratifying states have reservations limiting the extent to which they are bound to certain provisions. Notably, the UK and Germany have neither signed nor ratified the convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=164&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG Parties to the Oviedo Convention]&lt;/ref&gt; The UK considered the convention too restrictive, whereas Germany thought it too permissive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/457872/The_Oviedo_Convention_a_European_Legal_Framework_at_the_Intersection_of_Human_Rights_and_Health_Law Roberto Andorno, ''The Oviedo Convention: A European Legal Framework at the Intersection of Human Rights and Health Law,'' JIBL Vol 02, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues addressed by the Convention==
The preamble to the Oviedo Convention makes clear that its intention is for developments in biomedicine to benefit future generations and all of humanity.  The convention sets out the legal framework, which will ensure the protection of the dignity and identity of the human being. Intended as a supplementary instrument, the convention will be read in conjunction with other human rights protections namely: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights ([[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|UDHR]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Pages/Introduction.aspx UDHR]&lt;/ref&gt; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ([[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx ICCPR]&lt;/ref&gt; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ([[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx ICESCR]&lt;/ref&gt; the Convention on the Rights of the Child ([[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx CRC]&lt;/ref&gt; the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ([[Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms|ECHR]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf ECHR] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703000000/http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf |date=July 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Social Charter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/T/DGHL/Monitoring/SocialCharter/ European Social Charter]&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Principles===
The general provisions of the Oviedo Convention outline the object and purpose of the instrument. The aim is to secure the dignity of human beings within the field of biomedicine. Several principles are adopted in order to achieve this goal. Embodied in the first chapter to the convention, the principles relate to the primacy of the human being, equitable access to healthcare ([[health equity|equitable access to healthcare]]), and professional standards.

===Consent===
The issue of consent is pivotal to the Convention because of the relationship it has to individual [[autonomy]]. Medical intervention carried out without consent is a general prohibition within ''Article 5''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 5]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, consent must be free and fully informed. Free and [[informed consent]] is based on objective information. Protection is afforded to those not able to consent and provision is made for emergency situations. Specific rules must be observed where any medical intervention is carried out in any situation where a person is not able to give free and informed consent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Chapter II]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private life and right to information===
This issue is closely related to the right to privacy in [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]]. The scope of the right encompasses an individual’s entitlement not to know as well as the right to know information regarding their health. Interests of the patient, a third party, or society may lead to a restriction of either facet of the right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Chapter III]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human genome===
The Oviedo Convention incorporates provisions to address concerns relating to research into the [[human genome]]. Focus is honed on [[genetic testing]], the storage of genetic data and modification of the human genome.  Genetic testing as a tool for discrimination is prohibited under ''Article 11'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 11]&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Article 12'' allows genetic testing only for health or for scientific research linked to health purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 12]&lt;/ref&gt; The overarching theme is that genetic testing is reserved for health-related purposes only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, modification of the human genome, for reasons other than health-related is generally prohibited under ''Article 13'' of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 13]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific research===
The freedom of scientific research&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.co.nz/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=freedom%20of%20scientific%20research  World Congress for Freedom of Research]&lt;/ref&gt; is embodied in ''Chapter V''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Chapter V]&lt;/ref&gt; However, precedence is afforded to the protection of human dignity and other fundamental freedoms. Therefore, the freedom of research is qualified (''Article 15'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 15]&lt;/ref&gt; Research carried out on human beings is under strict controls set forth by the convention (''Article 16'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 16]&lt;/ref&gt; The general rules on consent stipulated in ''Chapter II''&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Chapter II]&lt;/ref&gt; must be observed in the context of research. In addition, the creation of embryos [[in vitro]] for the purposes of scientific research is expressly prohibited (''Article 18'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 18]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
===Organs and Transplantation===
The Convention provides the general rule that living donors for organ transplants are only to be utilised if there is no availability of organs from a deceased person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Chapter VI]&lt;/ref&gt; Any removed parts of the body must be disposed of respectfully in accordance with the wishes of the individual. In addition, there is to be no financial gain arising from the human body or its parts, however adequate compensation for expenses incurred for a medical procedure is not prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report, para 132]&lt;/ref&gt; The rules relating to consent laid out in ''Chapter II'' of the Convention also apply in the context of organ transplantation.

==Infringements of the Provisions of the Convention==
In accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, any individual who has suffered damage should have access to fair compensation (''Article 24'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 24]&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriate judicial protection is required to be put in place to ensure there is no infringement of the principles contained in the Convention. Proportionate sanctions will be imposed for non-compliance in accordance with ''Article 25''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/164.htm The Oviedo Convention, Article 25]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wider Protection==
The Oviedo Convention reflects a [[minimum harmonisation]] instrument. Therefore, parties to the convention have jurisdiction to provide a greater degree of protection than that offered by the convention. However, they cannot offer lesser protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report, para 161-162]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation of the Convention==
Questions of interpretation may be referred to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] for an advisory opinion to be issued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/164.htm Explanatory Report, para 164]&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are unable to bring an action on the basis of violation of the Oviedo Convention alone, but may reference the provisions in proceedings relating to the European Convention on Human Rights.

==Reservations==
A [[Reservation (law)|reservation]] may be made with respect to a particular provision of the convention (''Article 36''). Six states have reservations regarding particular provisions:
* [[Croatia]]
* [[Denmark]]
* [[France]]
* [[Norway]]
* [[Switzerland]]
* [[Turkey]]

==Denunciation==
Any [[signatory]] can denounce the convention by means of notification to the [[Secretary General of the Council of Europe]].

==Protocol on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Beings==
Deliberate [[cloning]], to create genetically identical human beings, is contrary to human dignity and constitutes a misuse of biology and medicine. It is therefore prohibited under this protocol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/168.htm Protocol on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Beings]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protocol on Transplantation==
The protocol stipulates that, insofar as is possible, equitable access to transplantation services should be ensured. In addition, any transplantation should be carried out with respect for rights and freedoms of donors, potential donors, and recipients of organs and tissues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/186.htm Protocol on Transplantation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protocol on Biomedical Research==
In the context of biomedical research, the protocol aims to ensure protection for dignity and identity of all human beings without discrimination. The Protocol recognises that research can contribute to saving and improving human life but it can also run contrary to the fundamental principles of dignity and other rights. Where this may be the case the research should not be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/195.htm Protocol on Biomedical Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protocol on Genetic Testing for Health Purposes==
The protocol responds to the concerns regarding possible improper use of genetic testing and aims to protect the dignity and identity of all human beings within this sphere. Through restricting use of genetic testing to health purposes only the convention aims to achieve its object and purpose. Genetic Testing is also permitted for scientific research, but its regulation is not included in this Protocol. It also establishes the need of free and informed consent and genetic counselling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/203.htm Protocol on Genetic Testing for Health Purposes]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was developed in collaboration with industry partners, including the Information Security Forum ([[Information Security Forum|ISF]]), the Information Assurance for Small and Medium Enterprises Consortium ([[IASME]]) and the British Standards Institution ([[BSI Group|BSI]]), and is endorsed by the UK Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/317481/Cyber_Essentials_Requirements.pdf|title=Cyber Essentials Scheme|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=HM Government|access-date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in 2014 by the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Cyber Essentials' scheme launched|url=http://ico.org.uk/news/current_topics/cyber-essentials|publisher=ICO|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assurance framework==
Organisations can earn two levels of certification, or badges:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber Essentials Scheme Assurance Framework|url=https://www.cyberstreetwise.com/cyberessentials/files/assurance-framework.pdf|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hotchin|first1=Jenny|title=Mitigating the risks created by cyber attacks|url=http://www.smeweb.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4891:mitigating-the-risks-created-by-cyber-attacks&amp;catid=64:features&amp;Itemid=102|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cyber Essentials: Organisations self-assess their systems, and this assessment is independently verified.
* Cyber Essentials Plus: Systems are independently tested, and Cyber Essentials is integrated into the organisation's information risk management. 

Annual recertification is recommended. Certifying Bodies are, in turn, licensed by Accreditation Bodies, which have been appointed by UK government.The five current accreditation bodies are [https://apmg-cyber.com/products/cyber-essentials APMG], [http://www.crest-approved.org/ CREST], [https://www.iasme.co.uk/ IASME], [https://irmsecurity.com/ IRM security] and [http://www.qgstandards.co.uk/ QG].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cyberaware.gov.uk/cyberessentials/get.html|title=Cyber Essentials - OFFICIAL SITE|website=www.cyberaware.gov.uk|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Council of Registered Ethical Security Testers|CREST]] has developed an assessment framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CREST supports UK Government Cyber Essentials scheme|url=http://www.crest-approved.org/industry-government/cyber-essentials/|publisher=CREST|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IASME]], one of the Accreditation Bodies, has incorporated the Cyber Essentials into the wider IASME information assurance standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iasme.co.uk/cyber-essentials-scheme/|title=Cyber Essentials Scheme – IASME|website=www.iasme.co.uk|access-date=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with [[ISO/IEC 27001]], organisations may choose to limit the scope of certification to a certain subset of their business.

==Controls==
The five main technical controls are:
#Boundary [[firewall (computing)|firewall]]s and internet gateways
#[[Configuration management|Secure configuration]] 
#[[Access control]]
#[[Malware]] protection
#[[Patch (computing)|Patch]] management

Cyber Essentials guidance breaks these down into finer details. These controls can be mapped against the controls required by [[ISO/IEC 27001]], the [[Standard of Good Practice]], and [[IASME Governance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Requirements for basic technical protection from cyber attacks|url=https://www.cyberstreetwise.com/cyberessentials/files/requirements.pdf|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Cyber Essentials has a narrower focus, emphasising technical controls rather than governance, risk, and policy.

==History==
The Cyber Essentials scheme was launched on 5 June 2014. Several organisations were quickly certified by the end of June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First seven SMEs bite on Government's flagship Cyber Essentials scheme|url=http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/security/3527693/first-seven-smes-bite-on-governments-flagship-cyber-essentials-scheme/|accessdate=1 July 2014|work=Computer World|date=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since October 2014, Cyber Essentials certification has been required for suppliers to central UK government who handle certain kinds of sensitive and personal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber essentials scheme: overview|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-essentials-scheme-overview|website=GOV.UK|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is intended to encourage adoption by businesses wishing to bid for government contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cyber risk and the UK’s Cyber Essentials Scheme|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Cyber-risk-and-the-UKs-Cyber-Essentials-Scheme|accessdate=1 July 2014|work=Computer Weekly|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insurers have suggested that certified bodies may attract lower insurance premiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Government launches Cyber Essentials security scheme|url=http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2348676/government-launches-cyber-essentials-security-scheme|accessdate=1 July 2014|date=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 6,000 Cyber Essentials certificates have been awarded to businesses and organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Matt Hancock's Cyber Security Speech|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/matt-hancocks-cyber-security-speech-at-the-institute-of-directors-conference|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[WannaCry ransomware attack]] [[NHS Digital]] refused to finance the £1 billion which was the estimated cost of meeting the Cyber Essentials Plus standard, saying this would not constitute value for money and that it had invested over £60 million and planned  plan to spend a further £150 million to address key cyber security weaknesses over the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Health chiefs refuse to foot £1bn bill to improve NHS cyber security |url=https://www.buildingbetterhealthcare.co.uk/news/article_page/Health_chiefs_refuse_to_foot_1bn_bill_to_improve_NHS_cyber_security/147855/cn164706 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |publisher=Building Better Healthcare |date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Distributed language''' represents an [[externalist]] perspective on human cognition. Instead of tracing communication to individual knowledge of a [[symbolic system]], language-activity is taken to sustain the human world.  Extending work by [[Humberto Maturana]], priority is given to how [[face-to-face interaction]] draws on multimodal activity or languaging .[1] As people language together, they gain the skills and knowledge needed to participate in a range of activities in which wordings play a part. Over time, these activities construct and maintain language as a whole. Distributed language thus links a biological theory of the [[origin of language]] to [[distributed cognition]]. Human cognitive and communicative abilities arise as people do things together while drawing on material, linguistic and other resources. Language activity is constrained by [[biology]], circumstances, and collective ways of life. While bodies sustain coordination, our lived realities are extended by the resources of a partly shared collective world. Thus, language cannot be separated from the artifacts and institutions or the behaviour of the living beings who undertake collaborative (and solo) tasks. This distributed perspective challenges the mainstream view that language use can be explained by individual competencies and microsocial rules. To ascribe 'language' to individual organisms is, on the distributed perspective, an error. Building on [[cognitive science]], the perspective challenges cognitive internalism by presenting language as a prime case of embodied and culturally embedded cognition. It emphasizes that the heterogeneity of human language does much to shape people, mind and society.

'''Embodied energy''' is the sum of all the energy required to produce any goods or services, considered as if that energy was incorporated or 'embodied' in the product itself. The concept can be useful in determining the effectiveness of energy-producing or energy-saving devices, or the "real" replacement cost of a building, and, because energy-inputs usually entail [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, in deciding whether a product contributes to or mitigates [[global warming]]. One fundamental purpose for measuring this quantity is to compare the amount of energy produced or saved by the product in question to the amount of energy consumed in producing it.

Embodied energy is an accounting method which aims to find the sum total of the energy necessary for an entire product life-cycle. Determining what constitutes this life-cycle includes assessing the relevance and extent of energy into raw material extraction, transport, manufacture, assembly, installation, disassembly, deconstruction and/or decomposition as well as human and secondary resources.

==History==
The history of constructing a system of accounts which records the energy flows through an environment can be traced back to the origins of [[accounting]] itself. As a distinct method, it is often associated with the [[Physiocrat]]'s "substance" theory of value,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Philip |last1=Mirowski |title=More Heat Than Light: Economics as Social Physics, Physics as Nature's Economics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rmVhZnHId-oC&amp;pg=PA154 |year=1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42689-3 |pages=154–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later the agricultural energetics of [[Sergei Podolinsky]], a Ukrainian physician,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=J. |last1=Martinez-Alier |title=Ecological Economics: Energy Environment and Society |publisher=Basil Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=1990 |isbn=0631171460 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ecological energetics of [[Vladmir Stanchinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Douglas R. |last1=Weiner |title=Models of Nature: Ecology, Conservation, and Cultural Revolution in Soviet Russia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8_2PvhwnO8C&amp;pg=PA70 |year=2000 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Pre |isbn=978-0-8229-7215-0 |pages=70–71, 78–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main methods of embodied energy accounting as they are used today grew out of [[Wassily Leontief]]'s [[input-output model]] and are called ''Input-Output Embodied Energy analysis''. Leontief's input-output model was in turn an adaptation of the [[Neoclassical economics|neo-classical]] theory of [[General equilibrium theory|general equilibrium]] with application to "the empirical study of the quantitative interdependence between interrelated economic activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=W. |last1=Leontief |title=Input-Output Economics |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=1966 |page=134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tennenbaum&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Tennenbaum |first=Stephen E. |title=Network Energy Expenditures for Subsystem Production |type=MS |url=http://www.esnips.com/doc/ac5215f1-e91d-4c30-8648-2eee1f31488c/Network_Energy_Thesis.pdf |year=1988 |docket=CFW-88-08 |oclc=20211746 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930190108/http://www.esnips.com/doc/ac5215f1-e91d-4c30-8648-2eee1f31488c/Network_Energy_Thesis.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leontief's Input-Output method was adapted to embodied energy analysis by Hannon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=B. |last1=Hannon |title=The Structure of ecosystems |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=535–546 |date=October 1973 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(73)90060-X |url=http://urizen-geography.nsm.du.edu/~psutton/Sutton_Courses/Geog_3890_Ecological_Economics/SeminalEEpapers/B_HannonStructureOfEcosystems.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe ecosystem energy flows. Hannon's adaptation tabulated the total direct and indirect energy requirements (the ''energy intensity'') for each output made by the system. The total amount of energies, direct and indirect, for the entire amount of production was called the ''embodied energy''.

==Methodologies==
Embodied energy analysis is interested in what energy goes to supporting a consumer, and so all energy depreciation is assigned to the final demand of consumer. Different methodologies use different scales of data to calculate energy embodied in products and services of nature and human civilization. International consensus on the appropriateness of data scales and methodologies is pending. This difficulty can give a wide range in embodied energy values for any given material. In the absence of a comprehensive global embodied energy public dynamic database, embodied energy calculations may omit important data on, for example, the rural road/highway construction and maintenance needed to move a product, human marketing, advertising, catering services, non-human services and the like. Such omissions can be a source of significant methodological error in embodied energy estimations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lenzen|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Without an estimation and declaration of the embodied energy error, it is difficult to calibrate the [[Sustainability#Sustainability definition as a ratio: please do not change spelling - see note|sustainability index]], and so the [[Value theory|value]] of any given material, process or service to environmental and human economic processes.

===Standards===
The SBTool, UK [[Code for Sustainable Homes]] and USA LEED  are methods in which the embodied energy of a product or material is rated, along with other factors, to assess a building's [[environmental impact assessment|environmental impact]]. Embodied energy is a concept for which scientists have not yet agreed absolute universal values because there are many variables to take into account, but most agree that products can be compared to each other to see which has more and which has less embodied energy. Comparative lists (for an example, see the University of Bath ''Embodied Energy &amp; Carbon Material Inventory''&lt;ref name="ICE Database"&gt;G.P.Hammond and C.I.Jones (2006) ''[http://www.circularecology.com/embodied-energy-and-carbon-footprint-database.html Embodied energy and carbon footprint database]'', Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Bath, United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt;) contain average absolute values, and explain the factors which have been taken into account when compiling the lists.

Typical embodied energy units used are MJ/kg (mega[[joules]] of energy needed to make a kilogram of product), t{{CO2}} (tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]] created by the energy needed to make a kilogram of product). Converting MJ to t{{CO2}} is not straightforward because different types of energy (oil, wind, solar, nuclear and so on) emit different amounts of carbon dioxide, so the actual amount of carbon dioxide emitted when a product is made will be dependent on the type of energy used in the manufacturing process. For example, the Australian Government&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmit.csiro.au/brochures/tech/embodied/ CSIRO on embodied energy: Australia's foremost scientific institution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225154902/http://www.cmit.csiro.au/brochures/tech/embodied/ |date=2006-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; gives a global average of 0.098 t{{CO2}} = 1 GJ. This is the same as 1 MJ = 0.098&amp;nbsp;kg{{CO2}} = 98 g{{CO2}} or 1&amp;nbsp;kg{{CO2}} = 10.204 MJ.

===Related methodologies===
In the 2000s drought conditions in [[Australia]] have generated interest in the application of embodied energy analysis methods to water. This has led to use of the concept of [[embodied water]].

== In transportation ==
Theoretically, embodied energy stands for the energy used to extract materials from mines, to manufacture vehicles, assemble, transport, maintain, transform them and to transport energy, and ultimately to recycle these vehicles. Besides, the energy needed to build and maintain transport networks, whether road or rail, should be taken into account as well. The process to be implemented is so complex that no one dares to put forward a figure.

According to the [[:fr:Institut du développement durable et des relations internationales]], in the field of transportation, "it is striking to note that we consume more embodied energy in our transportation expenditures than direct energy [...]. Put in other words, we consume less energy to move around in our personal vehicles than we consume the energy we need to produce, sell and transport the cars, trains or buses we use "&lt;ref&gt;(fr) [http://www.iddri.org/Publications/L-energie-grise-la-face-cachee-de-nos-consommations-d-energie L’énergie grise : la face cachée de nos consommations d’énergie] website iddri. org&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Jean-Marc Jancovici]] advocates a carbon footprint analysis of any transportation infrastructure project, prior to its construction&lt;ref&gt;(fr) [https://jancovici.com/publications-et-co/articles-de-presse/pour-un-bilan-carbone-des-projets-dinfrastructures-de-transport/ Pour un bilan carbone des projets d’infrastructures de transport] website jancovici. com&lt;/ref&gt;.

===In automobiles===
[[File:Car life cycle.svg|thumb|lang=en|upright=1.5|Car life cycle]]

==== Manufacturing ====
According to  [[Volkswagen]], the embodied energy contents of a Golf A3 with a [[petrol engine]] amounts to 18 000 kWh (i.e. 12%  of  545 GJ as shown in the report&lt;ref name="VW"&gt;(de) [http://www.volkswagen.de/content/medialib/vwd4/de/Volkswagen/Nachhaltigkeit/service/download/umweltberichte/umweltbericht_20012002deutsch48mb/_jcr_content/renditions/rendition.file/umweltberichte_par_0009_file.pdf Volkswagen environmental report 2001/2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192010/http://www.volkswagen.de/content/medialib/vwd4/de/Volkswagen/Nachhaltigkeit/service/download/umweltberichte/umweltbericht_20012002deutsch48mb/_jcr_content/renditions/rendition.file/umweltberichte_par_0009_file.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }} see page 27&lt;/ref&gt;). A  Golf A4 (equipped with a [[turbocharged direct injection]]) will show an embodied energy amounting to 22 000 kWh (i.e. 15% of 545 GJ as shown in the report&lt;ref name="VW" /&gt;). According to the French energy and environment agency ADEME &lt;ref&gt;(fr) [http://www.ademe.fr/sites/default/files/assets/documents/90511_acv-comparative-ve-vt-resume.pdf Life cycle assessment]  website www.ademe.fr see page 9&lt;/ref&gt; a motor car has an embodied energy contents of 20 800 kWh whereas an [[electric vehicle]] shows an embodied energy contents amounting to 34 700 kWh.

==== Fuel ====
As regards energy itself, the factor [[energy returned on energy invested]] (EROEI) of fuel can be estimated at 8, which means that to some amount of useful energy provided by fuel should be added 1/7 of that amount in embodied energy of the fuel. In other words, the fuel consumption should be augmented by 14% due to the fuel EROEI.

==== Road construction ====
We have to work here with figures, which prove still more difficult to obtain. In the case of road construction, the embodied energy would amount to 1/18 of the fuel consumption (i.e. 6%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pavementinteractive.org/2012/02/21/energy-and-road-construction-whats-the-mileage-of-roadway/  energy-and-road-construction] website www.pavementinteractive.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other figures available ====
Treloar, ''et al.'' have estimated the embodied energy in an average automobile in Australia as 0.27 [[Joule#Multiples|terajoules]] (i.e. 75 000 kWh) as one component in an overall analysis of the energy involved in road transportation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Love2/publication/228770848_Hybrid_life-cycle_inventory_for_road_construction_and_use/links/02bfe50f8f59609519000000.pdf Hybrid life-cycle inventory for road construction and use] website resaerchgate.net&lt;/ref&gt;

== In buildings ==
Although most of the focus for improving energy efficiency in buildings has been on their operational emissions, it is estimated that about 30% of all energy consumed throughout the lifetime of a building can be in its embodied energy (this percentage varies based on factors such as age of building, climate, and materials).  In the past, this percentage was much lower, but as much focus has been placed on reducing operational emissions (such as efficiency improvements in heating and cooling systems), the embodied energy contribution has come much more into play. Examples of embodied energy include: the energy used to extract raw resources, process materials, assemble product components, transport between each step, construction, maintenance and repair, deconstruction and disposal. As such, it is important to employ a whole-life carbon accounting framework in analyzing the carbon emissions in buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Ibn-Mohammed|first = T.|last2 = Greenough|first2 = R.|last3 = Taylor|first3 = S.|last4 = Ozawa-Meida|first4 = L.|last5 = Acquaye|first5 = A.|date = 2013-11-01|title = Operational vs. embodied emissions in buildings—A review of current trends|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778813004143|journal = Energy and Buildings|volume = 66|pages = 232–245|doi = 10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.07.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the energy field ==
=== EROEI ===
[[EROEI]] provides a basis for evaluating the embodied energy due to energy.

Final energy  has to be multiplied by &lt;math&gt; \frac  {\hbox{1}} {\hbox{EROEI}}&lt;/math&gt; in order to get the embodied energy.

Given an EROEI amounting to eight e.g., an eighth of the final energy corresponds to the embodied energy.

Not only that, for really obtaining overall embodied energy, embodied energy due to the construction and maintenance of power plants should be taken into account, too. Here, figures are badly needed.
=== Electricity ===
In the [[BP]] ''Statistical Review of World Energy June 2018'', [[Tonne of oil equivalent|toe]] are converted into [[Kilowatt hour|kWh]] "on the basis of thermal equivalence assuming 38% conversion efficiency in a modern thermal power station".

In [[France]], by convention, the ratio between  primary energy and final energy in electricity amounts to 2.58,&lt;ref&gt;(fr) [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000788395 Decree of 15th September 2006 on the energy performance diagnosis of existing buildings for sale in mainland France], website legifrance.gouv.fr&lt;/ref&gt; corresponding to  an efficiency of 0.3875 or 38.8%.

In [[Germany]], on the contrary, because of the swift development of the renewable energies, the ratio between  primary energy and final energy in electricity amounts to only 1.8,&lt;ref&gt;(de) [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/enev_2007/BJNR151900007.html laws in Internet] site web gesetze-im-internet.de see section 2.1.1&lt;/ref&gt; corresponding to an efficiency of 55.5%.

== Data processing ==
According to [[association négaWatt]], embodied energy related to digital services amounted to 3.5 TWh/a for networks and 10.0 TWh/a for data centres (half for the servers per se, i. e. 5 TWh/a, and the other half for the buildings in which they are housed, i. e. 5 TWh/a), figures valid in France, in 2015. The organization is optimistic about the evolution of the energy consumption in the digital field, underlining the technical progress being made&lt;ref&gt;(fr) [http://decrypterlenergie.org/la-revolution-numerique-fera-t-elle-exploser-nos-consommations-denergie Will digital revolution increase our energy consumption?] website decrypterlenergie.org, website of [[association négaWatt]].&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Cat fall 150x300 6fps.gif|thumb|upright|right|250px|A falling cat modeled as two independently rotating parts turns around while maintaining zero net angular momentum]]

The '''falling cat problem''' is a problem that consists of explaining the underlying [[physics]] behind the observation of the [[cat righting reflex]]: that is, how a free-falling body ([[cat]]) can change its orientation such that it is able to right itself as it falls to land on its feet, irrespective of its initial orientation, and without violating the law of [[conservation of angular momentum]].

Although amusing and trivial to pose, the solution of the problem is not as straightforward as its statement would suggest. The apparent contradiction with the law of conservation of angular momentum is resolved because the cat is not a [[rigid body]], but instead is permitted to change its shape during the fall owing to the cat's flexible [[vertebral column|backbone]] and non-functional [[collar-bone]]. The behavior of the cat is thus typical of the mechanics of [[deformable bodies]].

==History==
The falling cat problem has elicited interest from famous scientists including [[George Gabriel Stokes]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], and [[Étienne-Jules Marey]]. In a letter to his wife, Katherine Mary Clerk Maxwell, Maxwell wrote, "There is a tradition in Trinity that when I was here I discovered a method of throwing a cat so as not to light on its feet, and that I used to throw cats out of windows. I had to explain that the proper object of research was to find how quick the cat would turn round, and that the proper method was to let the cat drop on a table or bed from about two inches, and that even then the cat lights on her feet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Lewis|last2=Garnett|first2=William|title=The Life of James Clerk Maxwell|publisher=Macmillan and Company|isbn=978-1402161377|page=499|date=1999-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell's and other scientists interest with so-called "cat turning" was reputed to have caused the death of many cats after being dropped from windows of multi-storied buildings.{{Citation needed|date = September 2015}} Maxwell in particular was interested in discovering the precise height that a cat needed to be dropped from so that the cat would be incapable of using [[cat righting reflex|its righting reflex]] to land on its feet, an endeavor in which he eventually succeeded.

Whereas the cat-falling problem was regarded as a mere curiosity by Maxwell, Stokes, and others, a more rigorous study of the problem was conducted by [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] who applied [[chronophotography]] to capture the cat's descent on film using a chronophotographic gun. The gun, capable of capturing 12 frames per second, produced images from which Marey deduced that, as the cat had no [[rotational motion]] at the start of its descent, the cat was not "cheating" by using the cat handler's hand as a [[Lever|fulcrum]]. This in itself posed a problem as it implied that it was possible for a body in free fall to acquire angular momentum. Marey also showed that [[air resistance]] played no role in facilitating the righting of the cat's body.

[[File:Falling cat 1894.jpg|thumb|310px|left|''[[Falling Cat]]'' – images which appeared in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1894, captured by a chronophotographic gun, a device of [[Étienne-Jules Marey|Marey's]] own invention. The editor of ''Nature'' wrote, "The expression of offended dignity shown by the cat at the end of the first series indicates a want of interest in scientific investigation."]]

His investigations were subsequently published in ''[[Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences|Comptes Rendus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marey|first1=É.J|title=Des mouvements que certains animaux exécutent pour retomber sur leurs pieds, lorsqu'ils sont précipités d'un lieu élevé|date=1894|volume=119|pages=714–717|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a summary of his findings were published in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Photographs of a tumbling cat|journal=Nature|date=1894|volume=51|issue=1308|pages=80–81|bibcode = 1894Natur..51...80. |doi = 10.1038/051080a0 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 June 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The article's summary in ''Nature'' appeared thus:

{{Quotation| M. Marey thinks that it is the inertia of its own mass that the cat uses to right itself. The torsion couple which produces the action of the muscles of the vertebra acts at first on the forelegs which have a very small motion of inertia on account of the front feet being foreshortened and pressed against the neck. The hind legs, however, being stretched out and almost perpendicular to the axis of the body, possesses a moment of inertia which opposes motion in the opposite direction to that which the torsion couple tends to produce. In the second phase of the action, the attitude of the feet is reversed, and it is the inertia of the forepart that furnishes a fulcrum for the rotation of the rear.}}

Despite the publication of the images, many physicists at the time maintained that the cat was still "cheating" by using the handler's hand from its starting position to right itself, as the cat's motion would otherwise seem to imply a [[rigid body]] acquiring angular momentum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDonald|first1=Donald|title=How does a cat fall on its feet?|agency=The New Scientist|date=30 June 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solution==
The solution of the problem, originally due to {{Harvp|Kane|Scher|1969}}, models the cat as a pair of cylinders (the front and back halves of the cat) capable of changing their relative orientations. {{harvtxt|Montgomery|1993}} later described the Kane&amp;ndash;Scher model in terms of a [[connection (principal bundle)|connection]] in the configuration space that encapsulates the relative motions of the two parts of the cat permitted by the physics.  Framed in this way, the dynamics of the falling cat problem is a prototypical example of a [[nonholonomic system]] {{harv|Batterman|2003}}, the study of which is among the central preoccupations of [[control theory]].  A solution of the falling cat problem is a curve in the configuration space that is ''horizontal'' with respect to the connection (that is, it is admissible by the physics) with prescribed initial and final configurations.  Finding an optimal solution is an example of optimal [[motion planning]] ({{harvnb|Arbyan|Tsai|1998}}; {{harvnb|Ge|Chen|2007}}).

In the language of physics, Montgomery's connection is a certain [[Yang-Mills field]] on the configuration space, and is a special case of a more general approach to the dynamics of deformable bodies as represented by [[gauge field]]s ({{harvnb|Montgomery|1993}}; {{harvnb|Batterman|2003}}), following the work of {{Harvp|Shapere|Wilczek|1987}}.

'''Fideism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|d|eɪ|ɪ|z|əm|,_|ˈ|f|aɪ|d|i|-}}) is an [[epistemology|epistemological theory]] which maintains that [[faith]] is independent of [[reason]], or that reason and faith are hostile to each other and faith is superior at arriving at particular [[truth]]s (see [[natural theology]]). The word ''fideism'' comes from ''fides'', the Latin word for [[faith]], and literally means "faith[[-ism]]".{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005}}

[[Theology|Theologians]] and [[Philosophy|philosophers]] have responded in various ways to the place of faith and reason in determining the truth of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[idea]]s, [[morality]], and [[religious belief]]s. A fideist is one who argues for fideism. Historically, fideism is most commonly ascribed to four philosophers: [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [[Kierkegaard]], [[William James]], and [[Wittgenstein]]; with fideism being a label applied in a negative sense by their opponents, but which is not always supported by their own ideas and works or followers.{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005 | loc = [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/#2.2  section 2.2]}}  There are a number of different forms of fideism.&lt;ref name = Quinn2000&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Quinn | editor-first = Philip L | last = Taliaferro | first = Charles | year = 2000 | title = A companion to philosophy of religion | page = 376 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=9X-3sPj9m34C&amp;pg=PA376 | isbn = 0-631-21328-7 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[Alvin Plantinga]] defines "fideism" as "the exclusive or basic reliance upon faith alone, accompanied by a consequent disparagement of reason and utilized especially in the pursuit of philosophical or religious truth". The fideist therefore "urges reliance on faith rather than reason, in matters philosophical and religious", and therefore may go on to disparage the claims of reason.{{Refn | Plantinga, Alvin (1983). "Reason and Belief in God" in Alvin Plantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff (eds.), ''Faith and Rationality: Reason and Belief in God'', page 87. (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press).{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005 | loc = [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/#1  section 1]}}}}  The fideist seeks [[truth]], above all: and affirms that reason cannot achieve certain kinds of truth, which must instead be accepted only by faith.{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005 | loc = [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/#1  section 1]}} Plantinga's definition might be revised to say that what the fideist objects to is not so much "reason" per se—it seems excessive to call [[Blaise Pascal]] anti-rational—but ''[[evidentialism]]'': the notion that no belief should be held unless it is supported by evidence.

=== History ===
{{main article |Relationship between religion and science}}

=== Theories of truth ===
{{main article |Truth#Major theories}}
The doctrine of fideism is consistent with some, and radically contrary to other theories of truth:
* [[Correspondence theory of truth]]
* [[Pragmatic theory of truth]]
* [[Constructivist epistemology]]
* [[Consensus theory of truth]]
* [[Coherence theory of truth]]
* [[Subjectivism]]

Some{{Which|date=June 2012}} forms of fideism outright reject the correspondence theory of truth, which has major philosophical implications. Some{{Who|date=June 2012}} only claim a few religious details to be [[axiom]]atic.

=== Tertullian ===

Tertullian's ''De Carne Christi'' (On the Flesh of Christ])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Beyond Fideism: Negotiable Religious Identities| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tyTSs_dqwkcC | publisher= Ashgate| year= 2010| first = Olli-Pekka | last = Vainio| page= 25 | series = Transcending boundaries in philosophy and theology | ISBN = 978-1-40940679-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; says "the Son of God died; it is by all means to be believed, because it is [[Absurdity|absurd]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0315.htm | last = Tertullian | publisher = New Advent | title = On the Flesh of Christ | series = Fathers}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The statement ''"[[Credo quia absurdum]]"'' ("I believe because it is absurd") is sometimes cited as an example of views of the [[Church Fathers]], but this appears to be a misquotation of Tertullian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/articles/sider_credo.htm|title=Tertullian:  Sider, R.D., Credo Quia Absurdum?, Classical World 73 (1980) pp.417-9|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tertullian's statement, however, is not a fideist position; Tertullian was critiquing intellectual arrogance and the misuse of philosophy, but he remained committed to reason and its usefulness in defending the faith.{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Tertullian, First Theologian of the West| first =Eric | last = Osborn | publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|page= 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Luther ===
[[Martin Luther]] taught that faith informs the Christian's use of reason. Regarding the mysteries of Christian faith, he wrote, "All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed to us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd, and false." And "Reason is the greatest enemy that faith has." However, Luther conceded that, grounded upon faith in Christ, reason can be used in its proper realm, as he wrote, "Before faith and the knowledge of God reason is darkness in divine matters, but through faith it is turned into a light in the believer and serves piety as an excellent instrument. For just as all natural endowments serve to further impiety in the godless, so they serve to further salvation in the godly. An eloquent tongue promotes faith; reason makes speech clear, and everything helps faith forward. Reason receives life from faith; it is killed by it and brought back to life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Luther | first = Martin | year = 1883–2009 | ISBN = 0-85964-464-2 | place = Weimar | language = German | title = Tischreden |trans-title=Table talks | series = Werke: kritische Gesammtausgabe | publisher = Hermann Böhlau | volume = 3. aus den dreißiger Jahren | section = Die Sammlung von Konrad Cordatus (Schluß) | number = 2938a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blaise Pascal and fideism ===
[[File:Blaise Pascal Versailles.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Blaise Pascal]]]]
Another form of fideism is assumed by [[Pascal's Wager]]. Blaise Pascal invites the [[atheism|atheist]] considering [[faith]] to see faith in God as a cost-free choice that carries a potential reward.{{Sfn | Geisler | 1976 | p = 49}} He does not attempt to argue that God indeed exists, only that it might be valuable to assume that it is true. Of course, the problem with Pascal's Wager is that it does not restrict itself to a specific God, although Pascal did have in mind the Christian God as is mentioned in the following quote. In his ''[[Pensées]]'', Pascal writes:
{{Quote | Who then will blame Christians for not being able to give reasons for their beliefs, since they profess belief in a religion which they cannot explain? They declare, when they expound it to the world, that it is foolishness, ''stultitiam''; and then you complain because they do not prove it! If they proved it, they would not keep their word; it is through their lack of proofs that they show they are not lacking in sense. | ''Pensées'', no. 233}}

Pascal moreover contests the various proposed proofs of the existence of God as irrelevant. Even if the proofs were valid, the beings they propose to demonstrate are not congruent with the deity worshiped by historical faiths, and can easily lead to [[deism]] instead of revealed religion: "The God of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]—not the god of the philosophers!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Pensées | last = Pascal | first = Blaise | language = French |trans-title=Thoughts | publisher = Charles Louandre | place = Paris | year = 1854 | page = 40}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hamann and fideism ===
Considered to be the father of modern antirationalism, [[Johann Georg Hamann]] promoted a view that elevated faith alone as the only guide to human conduct. Using the work of [[David Hume]] he argued that everything people do is ultimately based on faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Redmond |first=M.|year=1987|title= The Hamann-Hume Connection|journal= Religious Studies|volume= 23|issue=1|pages= 97|publisher=Cambridge University Press|jstor= 20006314|doi=10.1017/s0034412500018564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without faith (for it can never be proven) in the existence of an external world, human affairs could not continue; therefore, he argued, all reasoning comes from this faith: it is fundamental to the human condition. Thus all attempts to base belief in God using reason are in vain. He attacks systems like [[Spinozism]] that try to confine what he feels is the infinite majesty of God into a finite human creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Isaiah | last = Berlin | title=Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder|author-link = Isaiah Berlin |page=297|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2000|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=U1373duui04C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kierkegaard===
Natural theologians may argue that Kierkegaard was a fideist of this general sort: the argument that God's existence cannot be certainly known, and that the decision to accept faith is neither founded on, nor needs, rational justification, may be found in the writings of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and his followers in [[Christian existentialism]]. Many of Kierkegaard's works, including ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', are under [[pseudonym]]s; they may represent the work of fictional authors whose views correspond to hypothetical positions, not necessarily those held by Kierkegaard himself.

In ''Fear and Trembling'', Kierkegaard focused on Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac. The New Testament apostles repeatedly argued that Abraham's act was an admirable display of faith. To the eyes of a non-believer, however, it must necessarily have appeared to be an unjustifiable attempted [[murder]], perhaps the fruit of an insane delusion. Kierkegaard used this example to focus attention on the problem of faith in general.{{Sfn | Geisler | 1976 | pp = 50–51}} He ultimately affirmed that to believe in the incarnation of Christ, in God made flesh, was to believe in the "absolute paradox", since it implies that an eternal, perfect being would become a simple human. Reason cannot possibly comprehend such a phenomenon; therefore, one can only believe in it by taking a "[[leap of faith]]".

===James and "will to believe"===
{{expand section|date=May 2013}}
American [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] philosopher and psychologist [[William James]] introduced his concept of the "[[The Will to Believe|will to believe]]" in 1896. Following upon his earlier theories of truth, James argued that some religious questions can only be answered by believing in the first place: one cannot know if religious doctrines are true without seeing if they work, but they cannot be said to work unless one believes them in the first place.

William James published many works on the subject of religious experience. His four key characteristics of religious experience are: 'passivity', 'ineffability', 'a noetic quality', and 'transiency'. Due to the fact that religious experience is fundamentally ineffable, it is impossible to hold a coherent discussion of it using public language. This means that religious belief cannot be discussed effectively, and so reason does not affect faith. Instead, faith is found through experience of the spiritual, and so understanding of belief is only gained through the practice of it.

=== Wittgenstein and fideism&lt;!--Linked from 'Template:Wittgenstein'--&gt; ===
The philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] did not write systematically about religion, though he did lecture on the topic. Some of his students' notes have been collected and published. On the other hand, it has been asserted that religion as a "form of life" is something that intrigued Wittgenstein to a great degree. In his 1967 article, entitled "Wittgensteinian Fideism", [[Kai Nielsen (philosopher)|Kai Nielsen]] argues that certain aspects of Wittgenstein's thought have been interpreted by Wittgensteinians in a "fideistic" manner. According to this position, religion is a self-contained—and primarily expressive—enterprise, governed by its own internal logic or "[[grammar]]". This view—commonly called '''Wittgensteinian fideism'''—states: (1) that religion is logically cut off from other aspects of life; (2) that religious concepts and discourse are essentially self-referential; and (3) that religion cannot be criticized from an external (i.e., non-religious) point of view.{{Sfn | Amesbury | 2005 | loc = [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/#2.2 section 2.2]}} Although there are other aspects that are often associated with the phenomena of Wittgensteinian fideism, Kai Nielsen has argued that such interpretations are implausible misrepresentations of the position. It is worth noting, however, that no self-proclaimed Wittgensteinian actually takes Nielsen's analysis to be at all representative of either Wittgenstein's view, or their own.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} This is especially true of the best-known Wittgensteinian philosopher of religion, [[Dewi Zephaniah Phillips|D. Z. Phillips]], who is also the best-known "Wittgensteinan fideist". In their book ''Wittgensteinian Fideism?'' (SCM Press, 2005), D. Z. Phillips and Kai Nielsen debate the status of Wittgensteinian fideism. Both agree that the position "collapses", though they think it fails for different reasons. For Nielsen, the position is socially and politically irresponsible since it ignores prudential, practical, and pragmatic considerations as a basis for criticizing different language games. For Phillips, the position fails because it is not Wittgensteinian, and thus is a caricature of his position. Amongst other charges, Nielsen argues most forcefully in an article entitled "On Obstacles of the Will" that Phillips' Wittgensteinian view is relevantly fideistic and that it, therefore, fails on the grounds that it cannot account for the possibility of external, cultural criticism. Phillips, in turn, in the last article in the book, entitled "Wittgenstein: Contemplation and Cultural Criticism", argues that the position is not Wittgensteinian at all, and that Wittgenstein's considered view not only allows for the possibility of external, cultural criticism, but also "advances" philosophical discussion concerning it.

=== Fideism and presuppositional apologetics ===
[[Presuppositional apologetics]] is a Christian system of [[apologetics]] associated mainly with [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Protestantism]]; it attempts to distinguish itself from fideism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page= 117|title= Epistemological crises, dramatic narratives, and apologetics: the ''ad hominem'' once more| first = Michael W | last = Payne|url=http://files.wts.edu/uploads/pdf/publications/wtj/payne-spring-02.pdf|journal=Westminster Theological Journal|issue=63|year=2002|publisher=Westminster Theological Seminary | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds that all human thought must begin with the proposition that the [[revelation]] contained in the [[Bible]] is [[axiom]]atic, rather than [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendentally]] necessary, else one would not be able to make sense of any human experience (see also epistemic [[foundationalism]]). To a non-believer who rejects the notion that the truth about God, the world, and themselves can be found within the Bible, the presuppositional apologist attempts to demonstrate the incoherence of the epistemic foundations of the logical alternative by the use of what has come to be known as the "Transcendental Argument for God's existence" (TAG). On the other hand, some presuppositional apologists, such as [[Cornelius Van Til]], believe that such a condition of true unbelief is impossible, claiming that all people actually believe in God (even if only on a subconscious level), whether they admit or deny it.

[[Presuppositional apologetics]] could be seen as being more closely allied with [[foundationalism]] than fideism, though it has sometimes been critical of both.

== Criticism ==

=== Fideism rejected by the Catholic Church ===
Catholic doctrine rejects fideism. The ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', representing [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]'s great regard for [[Thomism]], the teachings of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], affirms that it is a Catholic doctrine that God's existence can indeed be demonstrated by reason. Aquinas' position, which is to be distinguished from [[rationalism]], has deep roots in Western Christianity; it goes back to St. [[Anselm of Canterbury]]'s observation that the role of reason was to explain faith more fully: ''fides quaerens intellectum'', "faith seeking understanding", is his formula.

The official position of the Catholic Church is that while the existence of the one God can in fact be demonstrated by reason, nevertheless on account of the distortion of human nature caused by the first sin, humans can be deluded to deny the claims of reason that demonstrate God's existence. The [[Anti-Modernist oath]] promulgated by [[Pope Pius X]] required Catholics to affirm that:
{{Quote | God, the origin and end of all things, can be known with certainty by the natural light of reason from the created world (cf. Rom. 1:20), that is, from the visible works of creation, as a cause from its effects, and that, therefore, his existence can also be demonstrated&amp;nbsp;...}}

Similarly, the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' teaches that:
{{Quote | Though human reason is, strictly speaking, truly capable by its own natural power and light of attaining to a true and certain knowledge of the one personal God, who watches over and controls the world by his providence, and of the natural law written in our hearts by the Creator; yet there are many obstacles which prevent reason from the effective and fruitful use of this inborn faculty. For the truths that concern the relations between God and man wholly transcend the visible order of things, and, if they are translated into human action and influence it, they call for self-surrender and abnegation. The human mind, in its turn, is hampered in the attaining of such truths, not only by the impact of the senses and the imagination, but also by disordered appetites which are the consequences of original sin. So it happens that men in such matters easily persuade themselves that what they would not like to be true is false or at least doubtful. | ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', ss. 37.}}

[[Pope John Paul II]]'s [[encyclical]] ''[[Fides et Ratio]]'' also affirms that God's existence is in fact demonstrable by reason, and that attempts to reason otherwise are the results of sin. In the encyclical, John Paul II warned against "a resurgence of fideism, which fails to recognize the importance of rational knowledge and philosophical discourse for the understanding of faith, indeed for the very possibility of belief in God".

==== Fideist currents in Catholic thought ====
Historically, there have been a number of fideist strains within the Catholic orbit. Catholic traditionalism, exemplified in the nineteenth century by [[Joseph de Maistre]], emphasized faith in [[tradition]] as the means of divine revelation. The claims of reason are multiple, and various people have argued rationally for several contradictory things: in this environment, the safest course is to hold true to the faith that has been preserved through tradition, and to resolve to accept what the Church has historically taught. In his essay ''[[Du pape]]'' ("On the [[Pope]]"), de Maistre argued that it was historically inevitable that all of the Protestant churches would eventually seek reunification and refuge in the Catholic Church: [[science]] was the greater threat, it threatened all religious faith, and "no religion can resist science, except one".

Another refuge of fideist thinking within the Catholic Church is the concept of "[[sign of contradiction|signs of contradiction]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wojtyla | first = Carol | author-link = Pope John Paul II | title = Sign of contradiction | publisher = St. Paul Publications | year = 1979 | page = 8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this belief, the holiness of certain people and institutions is confirmed by the fact that other people contest their claims: this opposition is held to be worthy of comparison to the opposition met by Jesus Christ himself. This opposition and contradiction does not inherently prove something is true in Catholic thought, but only acts an additional possible indication of its truth. The idea of the sign of contradiction is related to the conviction that, while human reason is still operative, the distortion of fallen human nature causes concrete instances of reasoning to grope and often to go astray.

=== As sin ===
Fideism has received criticism from theologians who argue that fideism is not a proper way to worship God. According to this position, if one does not attempt to understand what one believes, one is not really believing. "Blind faith" is not true faith. Notable articulations of this position include:
* [[Peter Abelard]]&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Sic et Non]]''
* [[Lord Herbert]]&amp;nbsp;– ''[[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury#De Veritate|De Veritate]]''

=== As relativism ===
Fideism can lead to [[relativism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year= 1998|title = Rationality and cultural relativism|encyclopedia=[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NfRXYYhpLekC |editor-link = Edward Craig (philosopher)| editor-first = Edward | editor-last = Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of other religions puts a fundamental question to fideists—if faith is the only way to know the truth of God, how are we to know which God to have faith in? Fideism alone is not considered an adequate guide to distinguish true or morally valuable revelations from false ones. An apparent consequence of fideism is that all religious thinking becomes equal. The major monotheistic religions become on par with obscure [[fringe religions]], as neither can be advocated or disputed.

=== A case for reason ===
{{main article |Relationship between religion and science#Philosophy of science}}
These critics note that people successfully use reason in their daily lives to solve problems and that reason has led to progressive increase of knowledge in the sphere of science. This gives credibility to reason and argumentative thinking as a proper method for seeking truth. [[Galileo Galilei]], for example, said that "I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use."

On the other hand, according to these critics, there is no evidence that a religious faith that rejects reason would also serve us while seeking truth.

Fordism is "the eponymous manufacturing system designed to spew out standardized, low-cost goods and afford its workers decent enough wages to buy them."&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeG05|De Grazia 2005]]. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been described as "a model of economic expansion and technological progress based on mass production: the manufacture of standardized products in huge volumes using special purpose machinery and unskilled labor."&lt;ref name="TollidaySteven"&gt;Tolliday, Steven &amp; Zeitlin, Jonathan. ''The Automobile Industry and its Workers: Between Fordism and Flexibility'', St. Martin's Press (New York: 1987) pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Fordism was a method used to improve productivity in the automotive industry, the principle could be applied to any kind of manufacturing process. Major success stemmed from three major principles:

# The standardization of the product (nothing is handmade, but everything is made through machines and molds by unskilled workers)
# The employment of [[assembly line]]s, which use special-purpose tools and/or equipment to allow unskilled workers to contribute to the finished product
# Workers are paid higher "living" wages so that they can afford to purchase the products they make&lt;ref name="TollidaySteven" /&gt;

The principles, coupled with a technological revolution during Henry Ford's time, allowed for his revolutionary form of labor to flourish. His assembly line was revolutionary though not original as it had previously been used at slaughterhouses. His most original contribution to the modern world was breaking down complex tasks into simpler ones, with the help of specialised tools.&lt;ref name="Editedby"&gt;Edited by; Burrows, Rober; Gilbert, Nigel; Pollert, Anna. ''Fordism and Flexibility: Divisions and Change'' St. Martin's Press (New York: 1992) pp. 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Simpler tasks created interchangeable parts that could be used the same every time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dt13as.html|title=A Science Odyssey: People and Discoveries: Ford installs first moving assembly line|author=|date=|website=www.pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; That allowed for a very adaptable flexibility, creating an assembly line that could change its constituent components to meet the needs of the product being assembled.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt; In reality, the assembly line had already been around before Ford although not in quite the same effectiveness as he would create. His real accomplishment was recognizing the potential by breaking it all down into its components, only to build it back up again in a more effective and productive combination, thereby producing an optimum method for the real world.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt;

The major advantages of such a change was that it cut down on the manpower necessary for the factory to operate, and it deskilled the labour itself, cutting down on costs of production.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt; There are four levels of Fordism, as described by [[Bob Jessop]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Ford Motor Company assembly line.jpg|thumb|Ford cars (Model A shown) became a symbol of effective mass production. Efficiency both decreased the price of the cars and allowed Ford to increase his workers' wages. Hence, common workers could buy their own cars.]]

The [[Ford Motor Company]] was one of several hundred small automobile manufacturers that emerged between 1890 and 1910. After five years of producing automobiles, Ford introduced the [[Ford Model T|Model T]], which was simple and light but sturdy enough to drive on the country's primitive roads.&lt;ref name="FonerEric"&gt;Foner, Eric (2006). Give Me Liberty!: An American History. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, pp. 591–592.&lt;/ref&gt; The mass production of this automobile lowered its unit price, making it affordable for the average consumer. Furthermore, Ford substantially increased his workers' wages&lt;ref&gt;Sward, Keith (1948). The Legend of Henry Ford. New York: Rinehart &amp; Company, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; to combat rampant absenteeism and employee turnover, which approached 400% annually, which had the byproduct of giving them the means to become customers. That led to massive consumption. In fact, the Model T surpassed all expectations because it attained a peak of 60% of the automobile output within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Rae, John B. (1969). Henry Ford. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production system that Ford exemplified involved synchronization, precision, and specialization within a company.&lt;ref&gt;Rae, John B. (1969). Henry Ford. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford and his senior managers did not use the word "Fordism" themselves to describe their motivations or worldview, which they did not consider an "[[wikt:ism#Noun|ism]]". However, many contemporaries framed their worldview as one and applied the name Fordism to it.&lt;ref name="Hounshell_1984_pp263,376"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pages=263, 376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term gained prominence when it was used by [[Antonio Gramsci]] in 1934 in his essay "Americanism and Fordism" in his ''[[Prison Notebooks]]''. Since then, it has been used by a number of writers on [[economics]] and society, mainly but not exclusively in the [[Marxist]] tradition.

According to historian [[Charles S. Maier]], Fordism proper was preceded in Europe by [[Taylorism]], a technique of labor discipline and workplace organization, based upon supposedly-scientific studies of human efficiency and incentive systems. It attracted European intellectuals, especially in Germany and Italy, from the ''[[fin de siècle]]'' to [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

After 1918, however, the goal of Taylorist labor efficiency thought in Europe moved to "Fordism," the reorganization of the entire productive process by the moving assembly line, standardization, and the mass market. The grand appeal of Fordism in Europe was that it promised to sweep away all the archaic residues of precapitalist society, by subordinating the economy, society, and even the human personality to the strict criteria of technical rationality.&lt;ref name="Editedby" /&gt; The [[Great Depression]] blurred the utopian vision of American [[technocracy]], but [[World War II]] and its aftermath revived the ideal.

The principles of Taylorism were quickly picked up by [[Vladimir Lenin]] and applied to the industrialization of the [[Soviet Union]].

Later, under the inspiration of Gramsci, Marxists picked up the Fordism concept in the 1930s and developed [[Post-Fordism]] in the 1970s. Antonio and Bonanno (2000) trace the development of Fordism and subsequent economic stages, from globalization to neoliberal globalization, during the 20th century, and emphasized America's role in globalization. "Fordism," for Gramsci, meant routine, intensified labor to promote production. Antonio and Bonanno argue that Fordism peaked in the post-World War II decades of American dominance and mass [[consumerism]] but collapsed from political and cultural attacks on the people in the 1970s.

Advances in technology and the end of the [[Cold War]] ushered in a new "neoliberal" phase of globalization in the 1990s. Antonio and Bonanno further suggest that negative elements of Fordism, such as economic inequality, remained, allowing related cultural and environmental troubles, which inhibited America's pursuit of democracy to surface.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio and Bonanno, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Thomas Hughes has detailed how the [[Soviet Union]], in the 1920s and the 1930s, enthusiastically embraced Fordism and Taylorism by importing American experts in both fields as well as American engineering firms to build parts of its new industrial infrastructure. The concepts of the [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plan]] and the centrally-[[planned economy]] can be traced directly to the influence of Taylorism on Soviet thinking. Hughes quotes [[Joseph Stalin]]:&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;Hughes, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"American efficiency is that indomitable force which neither knows nor recognizes obstacles; which continues on a task once started until it is finished, even if it is a minor task; and without which serious constructive work is inconceivable.... The combination of the Russian revolutionary sweep with American efficiency is the essence of Leninism."&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;{{rp|251}}}}

Hughes describes how, as the Soviet Union developed and grew in power, both the Soviets and the Americans chose to ignore or deny the contribution of American ideas and expertise. The Soviets did so because they wished to portray themselves as creators of their own destiny and not indebted to their rivals. Americans did so because they did not wish to acknowledge, during the Cold War, their part in creating a powerful rival.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;

==Regulation theory==
{{original research|date=November 2012}}

Fordism is a key concept in the theories of the [[Regulation school]], often in contrast to [[post-Fordism]], and the term is also used in [[Western Marxism|Western Marxist]] thought.

[[File:Mall culture jakarta36.jpg|thumb|Mass consumption is the other side of Fordism.]]

In Regulation theory, it is a "regime of accumulation" or a macroeconomic pattern of growth, developed in the US and diffused in various forms to Western Europe after 1945. It consisted of domestic [[mass production]] with a range of institutions and policies supporting mass consumption, including stabilizing [[economic policies]] and [[Keynesian]] demand management that generated national demand and social stability; it also included a class compromise or social contract entailing family-supporting wages, job stability and internal labor markets leading broadly shared prosperity: rising incomes were linked to national productivity from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. At the level of the labor process Fordism is [[Taylorist]] and as a national mode of regulation Fordism is [[Keynesianism]].

The social-scientific concept of "Fordism" was introduced by the French [[regulation school]], sometimes known as [[regulation theory]], which is a Marxist-influenced strand of political economy. According to the regulation school, capitalist production paradigms are born from the crisis of the previous paradigm; a newborn paradigm is also bound to fall into crisis sooner or later. The crisis of Fordism became apparent to Marxists in late 1960s.

Marxist regulation theory talks of Regimes of Capital Accumulation (ROA) and Modes of Regulation (MOR). ROAs are periods of relatively settled economic growth and profit across a nation or global region. Such regimes eventually become exhausted, falling into crisis, and are torn down as capitalism seeks to remake itself and return to a period of profit. Such periods of capital accumulation are "underpinned," or stabilised, by MOR. A plethora of laws, institutions, social mores, customs and hegemonies both national and international work together to create the environment for long-run capitalist profit.

Fordism is a tag used to characterise the post-1945 long boom experienced by western nations. It is typified by a cycle of mass production and mass consumption, the production of standardized (most often) consumer items to be sold in (typically) protected domestic markets, and the use of Keynesian economic policies. While the standard pattern is postwar America, national variations of this standard norm are well known. Regulation theory talks of National Modes of Growth to denote different varieties of Fordism across western economies.

Fordism as an ROA broke down, dependent on national experiences, somewhere between the late 1960s and the mid-1970s. Western economies experienced slow or nil economic growth, rising inflation and growing unemployment, much of this as a result of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 oil shock]].

==Post-Fordism==
[[File:Office Worker with Two Monitors.JPG|thumb|Information technology, white-collar work, and specialization are some of the attributes of post-Fordism.]]

The period after Fordism has been termed [[Post-Fordism|Post-Fordist]] and Neo-Fordist. The former implies that global capitalism has made a clean break from Fordism, including overcoming its inconsistencies, but the latter implies that elements of the Fordist ROA continued to exist. The Regulation School preferred the term After-Fordism (or the French ''Après-Fordisme'') to denote that what comes after Fordism was or is not clear.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, S. Brave new world. ''Marxism Today'', October 1988, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Post-Fordist economies:&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt;
* New information technologies are important.
* Products are marketed to [[niche market]]s rather than in mass consumption patterns based on [[social class]].
* [[Service industry|Service industries]] predominate over manufacturing.
* The workforce is feminized.
* Financial markets are globalized.

A religion based on the worship of [[Henry Ford]] is a central feature of the [[technocracy]] in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s  ''[[Brave New World]]'', where the principles of mass production are applied to the generation of people as well as to industry.&lt;ref&gt;"''Brave New World'' is a critique of this streamlining process, of its all-too-pragmatic father Henry Ford, and finally of the Fordist workers whose lives of repetitive labor and goals of material comfort appeared to have triumphed over notions of intellectual inquiry and self-reflection".

[[Biodiversity]] on the scale of [[agricultural]] fields or landscapes, which provides [[ecosystem services]] that support [[Sustainable agriculture|sustainable agricultural]] production and can also have a positive spin-off to the regional and global environment and society as a whole{{cn|date=August 2014}}.

== Functional agrobiodiversity conceptual diagram ==
[[File:FAB conceptual diagram.jpg|691x922px]]

Functional AgroBiodiversity provides regulating, provisioning and cultural ecosystem services that are essential for human well-being. Positive synergies often exist among regulating, provisioning and cultural services and with biodiversity conservation as can be seen from this conceptual diagram. The green area in the diagram highlights the core focus of the European Learning Network. The red area highlights positive spin-off of Functional AgroBiodiversity to the local (e.g. water quality, recreation) and global environment (e.g. [[climate change]]) and society as a whole. The graph is adapted from the [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] (2005). Supporting services are not included as they are not directly used by the people.

Recently, a project has been initiated which is called 'European Learning Network on Functional AgroBiodiversity', of which the secretariat is held by [[ECNC-European Centre for Nature Conservation|ECNC]]. The goal of this network is to exchange knowledge and experience between across country and language borders and between different actors within the field of Functional AgroBiodiversity.

The '''hierarchy of the sciences''' is a theory formulated by [[Auguste Comte]] in the 19th century. This theory states that science develops over time beginning with the simplest and most general scientific discipline, [[astronomy]], which is the first to reach the "positive stage" (one of three in Comte's [[law of three stages]]). As one moves down the "hierarchy", this theory further states that sciences become more complex and less general, and that they will reach the positive stage later. Disciplines further down the hierarchy are said to depend more on the developments of their predecessors; the highest discipline on the hierarchy is the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://media.pfeiffer.edu/lridener/DSS/Comte/COMTEW4.HTML |title=Comte - The Work - Hierarchy of the Sciences |website=media.pfeiffer.edu |access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, there are higher levels of consensus and faster rates of advancement in [[physics]] and other [[natural sciences]] than there are in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cole |first=Stephen |date=July 1983 |title=The Hierarchy of the Sciences? |url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/227835 |journal=American Journal of Sociology |language=en |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=111–139 |doi=10.1086/227835 |issn=0002-9602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that, after controlling for the number of hypotheses being tested, positive results are 2.3 times more likely in the social sciences than in the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fanelli |first=Daniele |date=2010-04-07 |title="Positive" Results Increase Down the Hierarchy of the Sciences |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0010068 |journal=PLOS ONE |language=en |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=e10068 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010068 |pmc=2850928 |pmid=20383332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that the degree of [[scientific consensus]] is highest in the physical sciences, lowest in the social sciences, and intermediate in the [[biological sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fanelli |first=Daniele |last2=Glänzel |first2=Wolfgang |date=2013-06-26 |title=Bibliometric Evidence for a Hierarchy of the Sciences |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066938 |journal=PLOS ONE |language=en |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=e66938 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0066938 |pmc=3694152 |pmid=23840557}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dean Simonton]] argues that a composite measure of the scientific status of disciplines ranks [[psychology]] much closer to biology than to sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Simonton |first=Dean Keith |date=2004 |title=Psychology's Status as a Scientific Discipline: Its Empirical Placement Within an Implicit Hierarchy of the Sciences. |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-11097-002 |journal=Review of General Psychology |language=en |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=59–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research projects, essays, and documentation are the products of a collaboration between humanities and computer science research faculty, computer professionals, student assistants and project managers, and library faculty and staff. In many cases, this work is supported by private or federal funding agencies. In all cases, it is supported by the Fellows’ home departments; the College or School to which those departments belong; the University of Virginia Library; the Vice President for Research and Public Service; the Vice President and Chief Information Officer; the Provost; and the President of the University of Virginia.

==History==
The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities was established at the University of Virginia in 1992, with a major grant from IBM and a multi-year commitment of support from the University.

IATH’s founders are in humanities computing, digital scholarship, and academic administration. Beginning in 1992 a steering committee of scholars, including [[Edward Ayers]], [[Alan Batson]], [[Jerome McGann]], [[Kendon Stubbs]] and [[William Wulf]] managed IATH. A search committee commissioned by the steering committee carried out the search for a director of the institute. [[John Unsworth]] was selected, and his term began September 1, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.virginia.edu/content/new-leader-ever-expanding-university-library-looks-future |title=With New Leader, Ever-Expanding University Library Looks to the Future |work=UVA Today |publisher=[[University of Virginia]] |first=Katie |last=McNally |date=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IATH has generated over $10.7 million in grant funding and gifts in kind since it began operations.  Much of this funding has come from Federal agencies and private foundations, and has gone to support faculty research and teaching across the University.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16384">'''[[Island]] [[ecology]]''' is the study of island organisms and their interactions with each other and the environment.  Islands account for nearly 1/6 of earth’s total land area,&lt;ref name="Paulay"&gt;Paulay, G. 1994. Biodiversity on Oceanic Islands: Its Origin and Extinction. ''American Zoology'' 34: 134-144.&lt;/ref&gt; yet the ecology of island ecosystems is vastly different from that of mainland communities.  Their isolation and high availability of empty [[Ecological niche|niche]]s leads to increased [[speciation]].  As a result, island ecosystems comprise 30% of the world’s [[biodiversity hotspots]], 50% of marine tropical diversity, and some of the most unusual and rare species.&lt;ref name="Gerlach"&gt;Gerlach, Justin.  2008. [http://islandbiodiversity.com/gim.htm Island biodiversity - issues and opportunities]. World Conservation Congress&lt;/ref&gt;  Many species still remain unknown.

The diversity of species on islands is highly impacted by human activities such as [[deforestation]] and introduction of [[exotic species]].  In response, ecologists and managers are directing attention towards [[Conservation biology|conservation]] and [[Restoration ecology|restoration]] of island species.  Because they are simple systems, islands provide an opportunity to study processes of [[extinction]] that can be extrapolated to larger ecosystems.

== Ecological processes on islands ==

Islands are attractive sites for ecological research because they provide clear examples of evolution in action.  They show interesting patterns of colonization, adaptation, and speciation.

===Colonization and establishment===

Islands are surrounded by water, and may or may not exist as part of a continental land mass.  Oceanic islands arise due to volcanic activity or reef growth, and usually subside over time due to erosion and changing sea levels.&lt;ref name="Paulay" /&gt;  When islands emerge, they undergo the process of [[ecological succession]] as species colonize the island (see theory of [[island biogeography]]).  New species cannot immigrate via land, and instead must arrive via air, water, or wind.  As a result, organisms with high [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] capabilities, such as plants and birds, are much more common on islands than are poorly dispersing taxa like mammals.&lt;ref name="Paulay" /&gt;  However, some mammals are present on islands, presumably from swimming or riding on natural “rafts” that are washed away from the mainland.

Of the species that arrive, only some will be able to survive and establish populations.  As a result, islands have fewer species than mainland habitats.  Island populations are small and exhibit low genetic variability (see [[founder effect]]), but are isolated from the predators and competitors that they initially evolved with.  This can lead to a process called [[ecological release]], where a species is released from its ancestral community interactions and then colonizes new niches.

===Adaptation===

In response to these changing ecological pressures, island species can become much more docile than their mainland counterparts, and may grow larger (see [[island gigantism]]) or smaller (see [[island dwarfism]]).  Some of these unique adaptations are reflected in charismatic island species such as the [[giant tortoise]], [[Komodo dragon]], or [[pygmy mammoth]]s.  
[[File:Varanus komodoensis 2.jpg|thumb|The Komodo dragon is an example of island gigantism.]] After immigration, birds, and some reptiles or mammals, tend to become larger and predatory,&lt;ref&gt;Alcover, J. A. and M. McMinn. 1994. Predators of Vertebrates on Islands. ''BioScience'' 44(1): 12-18.&lt;/ref&gt; showing relaxed [[intraspecific competition]].&lt;ref&gt;Stamps, J.A. and M. Buechner. 1985. The Territorial Defense Hypothesis and the Ecology of Insular Vertebrates. ''The Quarterly Review of Biology'' 60(2): 155-181.&lt;/ref&gt;  For mammals, small species will increase in size and large species will decrease in size.&lt;ref&gt;Van Valen, L.M. 1973. Pattern and the Balance of Nature. ''Evolutionary Theory'' 1: 31−49.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is referred to as the “island rule,” and is suggested to minimize energy expenditure.&lt;ref name="McNab"&gt;McNab, B.K. 2002. Minimizing energy expenditure facilitates vertebrate persistence on oceanic islands. Ecology Letters 5(5): 693-704.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other adaptations to life on islands include increased [[poikilothermy]],&lt;ref name="McNab" /&gt; relaxed anti-predator behavior,&lt;ref&gt;Blumstein, D.T. 2002. Moving to suburbia: ontogenetic and evolutionary consequences of life on predator-free islands. Journal of Biogeography 29(5): 685-692.&lt;/ref&gt; and reduced [[sexual selection]]&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, S.C. 2000. High fidelity on islands: a comparative study of extrapair paternity in passerine birds. '''Behavioral Ecology''' 11(3): 265-273.&lt;/ref&gt; in animals, and loss of herbivore defenses&lt;ref&gt;Vourc’h, G., J.L. Martin, P. Duncan, J. Escarre, and T.P. Clausen. 2001. Defensive adaptations of Thuja plicata to ungulate browsing: a comparative study between mainland and island populations. ''Oecologia'' 126(1): 84-93.&lt;/ref&gt; and reduced dispersal&lt;ref&gt;Cody, M.L. and J.M. Overton. 1996. Short-term evolution of reduced dispersal in island plant populations. ''Journal of Ecology'' 84(1): 53-61.&lt;/ref&gt; in plants.

===Speciation===

The formation of new islands and their isolation from the mainland provides many unoccupied niches for species to adapt to.  Since immigration of predators and competitors is limited, many organisms are able to persist in these new niches.  This results in a high occurrence of [[endemism]], where species are unique to a localized area.  For example, 50% of endemic bird areas are found on islands.&lt;ref name="Gerlach" /&gt;

Endemism is often the result of [[adaptive radiation]].&lt;ref name="Paulay" /&gt;  Adaptive radiation is when a single species colonizes an area and rapidly diversifies to fill all of the available niches.  A common example is the assemblage of finch species documented by [[Charles Darwin]] in the [[Galapagos Islands]].  Darwin’s finches exhibited adaptive radiation by evolving different beak sizes to exploit the diversity of seeds present on the different islands.  [[File:Palila.jpg|thumb|The palila, one of several endangered honeycreepers that evolved through adaptive radiation and are endemic to the Hawaiian Islands.]]

Because the distributions of these populations are limited by their island habitats, they tend to have fewer individuals than their mainland counterparts and lower genetic variation.  This, along with the behavioral and ecological factors mentioned above, makes island species more vulnerable to extinction.&lt;ref name="Paulay" /&gt;

===Survival===

The continued survival of species on islands depends on factors such as natural [[Selection (biology)|selection]], genetic variation, natural disturbances (hurricanes, volcanic eruptions) and human-caused disturbances (introduced species, habitat loss).  Human-caused disturbances tend to be the greatest cause of mortality, and understanding the causes of extinction facilitates conservation efforts.

=== Human impacts on island ecosystems ===

The movement of humans to islands has led to rapid extinction of native island species either from hunting, [[habitat destruction]], or [[introduced species]].

===Hunting===

Many large animals on islands have been hunted to extinction by humans.  A well-known example is the [[dodo]], once found on the island of [[Mauritius]].  It evolved to become large, flightless and docile, and was subsequently driven to extinction by humans and introduced predators.

===Habitat destruction===
The depletion of natural resources can have dramatic effects on island ecology.  On [[Easter Island]], the depletion of the forest by humans not only resulted in widespread loss of species, but also the collapse of the island civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Bahn, P and J. Flenley. 1992. Easter Island, Earth Island. Thames and Hudson, London.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Luftbild Osterinsel.jpg|thumb|Easter Island has been a site of dramatic ecological change.]] Today there are over 500 million people on islands, all dependent on local resources either directly (traditional use) or indirectly (ecotourism revenue).  Population growth and development result in heavy [[deforestation]], [[pollution]], and [[over-exploitation]].  Overharvesting of ocean fauna is particularly troubling as yields of [[coral reef fish]] species are an important food source for island populations.

===Introduced species===

Humans have contributed to globalization and decreased effective isolation of island communities, allowing for invasion of exotic species.  This can have a profound effect on the native species.  In [[Guam]], the introduced [[brown tree snake]] ate nearly all of the native vertebrate species to extinction.  Feral cats and dogs have also greatly diminished native vertebrate populations on islands, through both predation and disease.  Introduced [[ungulate]]s are another major threat, as they graze on native vegetation and can destroy entire forests.&lt;ref&gt;Towns, D.R. and W.J. Ballantine. 1993. Conservation and Restoration of New Zealand Island Ecosystems. ''Trends in Evolution and Ecology'' 8(12): 452-457.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exotic grasses can out-compete native [[understory]] species and increase the risk of fire.&lt;ref&gt;D’Antonio, C.M. and P.M. Vitousek. 1992. Biological Invasions by Exotic Grasses, the Grass/Fire Cycle, and Global Change. Annual Review of Ecological Systematics 23: 63-87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lastly, [[social insects]] such as ants also cause major problems.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, F. R., A.C. Medeiros, L.L. Loope, and W.W. Zuehlke. 1992. Effects of the Argentine ant on arthropod fauna of Hawaiian high-elevation shrubland. ''Ecology'' 73: 1313-1322.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global warming===

Global warming is emerging as a strong cause of species loss on islands.  This can be due to [[Current sea level rise|sea level rise]], intrusion of salt water into freshwater habitats, or species inability to adapt to increasing temperatures and extreme weather events.  Plant species are particularly susceptible.&lt;ref&gt;Kreft, H., W. Jetz, J. Mutke, G. Kier, and W. Barthlott. 2008. Global diversity of island floras from a macroecological perspective. ''Ecology Letters'' 11(2): 116-127.&lt;/ref&gt;  In more isolated areas, such as the Southern Ocean Islands, indirect effects such as invasive species and global warming can play a greater role in influencing populations than overexploitation, pollution and habitat loss.&lt;ref&gt;Chown, S.L., J.E. Lee, and J.D. Shaw. 2008. Conservation of Southern Ocean Islands: Invertebrates as exemplars. ''Journal of Insect Conservation'' 12(4): 277-291.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:NukutoaHighTide.JPG|thumb|[[Current sea level rise|Sea level rise]] is a pressing concern for many island people.]]

===Trophic cascades===

Human activities and the introduction of non-native species often cause [[trophic cascade]]s, where direct effects on one species result in indirect effects on other species in the food web.  An example is on [[Santa Cruz Island]] of the [[California Channel Islands]], where [[DDT]] poisoning reduced [[bald eagle]] populations. This, along with an abundance of introduced feral pigs for prey, allowed [[golden eagle]]s to colonize the island and replace bald eagles.  However, the golden eagles also ate native [[island fox]]es.  Fox population levels decreased to near extinction, while [[skunk]] populations increased due to relaxed competition with foxes.

== Island conservation ==

=== Conservation on islands ===

Since island ecosystems are self-contained, it should be possible to mitigate many of the threats to species.  Ecologists and managers are working together to prioritize areas for conservation and to quickly design and implement action plans.  Not everything can be put into a reserve, so it is important to first compile pertinent information and prioritize areas of concern.&lt;ref name="Kepler"&gt;Kepler, C.B. and J.M. Scott. 1985. Conservation of Island Ecosystems. ICBP Technical Publication Number 3: 255-271.&lt;/ref&gt;  Once an area has been chosen, managers must then acquire ownership and gain support.  Local experts and indigenous populations should also be involved in this process.&lt;ref name="Kepler" /&gt;  Having clearly defined goals will facilitate the many necessary interactions between people and agencies.&lt;ref name="Kepler" /&gt;  Once a reserve is in place, managers can then practice [[adaptive management]] and do continued community education.  

On land, island conservation focuses on the protection of species and their habitat.  In some cases, conservation can be integrated with agricultural production.  For example, the ''[[Acacia koa]]'' plantations and wooded pastures in [[Hawaii]] are anthropogenically altered ecosystems, yet allow connectivity between forest fragments and thus maintain higher diversity than would open pasture.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, R.L., L.P. Goldstein, and G.C. Daily. 2008. Assessing the conservation value of a human-dominated island landscape: Plant diversity in Hawaii. Biodiversity and Conservation 17(7): 1765-1781.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other directions include habitat restoration, and eradication of introduced predators, ungulates, and exotic plants (via hunting, removal or [[biological control]]).

In marine ecosystems, there has been increasing establishment of “no-take” reserves.  This allows for reestablishment of native species, and also augmentation of commercially harvested species.&lt;ref&gt;Towns, D.R. and W.J. Ballantine. 1993. Conservation and Restoration of New Zealand Island Ecosystems. Trends in Evolution and Ecology 8(12): 452-457.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in both terrestrial and marine systems, these actions are expensive and do not always result in the desired outcomes.  For example, some non-natives become [[keystone species]] and their removal can cause more harm than good to the ecosystem.  To be more effective, managers of island ecosystems should share information and learn from each other’s mistakes.&lt;ref name="Cronk"&gt;Cronk, Q.C.B. 1997. Islands: stability, diversity, conservation. Biodiversity and Conservation 6: 477-493.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Europäischer hummer.jpg|thumb|Lobster benefit greatly from the establishment of no-take zones on islands such as Great Britain, New Zealand, and Tonga.]]

=== Island restoration ===
{{main|Island restoration}}

Island conservation tends to focus on preservation of individual species and their habitats.  However, many ecologists caution that ecological and evolutionary processes should be conserved as well.&lt;ref name="Cronk" /&gt;  The conservation of island communities as a whole is closely linked to [[Restoration ecology|restoration]].  

Active restoration on islands can be done for both animal species (translocations, induced breeding) and plant species (reforestation).  Creating goals for restoration can be challenging because it is often impossible to restore the ecosystem to its “historic” or “normal” state, if that state can even be clearly defined.  Restoration is never complete, as ecological communities are always in a state of change.

=== Sustainable use ===

As resource depletion is a major issue on islands, the needs of human populations must also be taken into account.  On many islands, scientists and managers are studying traditional practices of indigenous populations as potential conservation solutions.  In some cases, limited-take systems that serve the community may provide a better alternative to fully closed protected areas, if there are not enough resources for proper enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Cinner, J.E., M.J. Marnane, and T.R. McClanahan. 2005. Conservation and community benefits from traditional coral reef management at Ahus Island, Papua New Guinea. Conservation Biology 19(6): 1714-1723.&lt;/ref&gt;  Public education plays an important role.

'''Korean Confucian art''' took strong hold with the Yi generals who set in place the [[Joseon dynasty]] which distinguished itself in many ways by promoting [[Korean Confucianism|Confucian thought]] as the basis for a new national vision. Differentiating itself by restraint, spartan choices of color, and design, understatement, and great care and precision, the legacy of this art since the 13th century has been extensive throughout Asia. Confucian art was inspired of course by Confucius. Confucian art originated in China, then spread westwards on the Silk road, southward down to southern China and then onto Southeast Asia, and eastwards through northern China on to Japan and Korea. 

[[Korean flower arrangement]] is part of the Confucian tradition.

A '''magnetohydrodynamic generator''' ('''MHD generator''') is a [[magnetohydrodynamic converter]] that transforms [[thermal energy]] and [[kinetic energy]] into [[electricity]]. MHD generators are different from traditional [[electric generator]]s in that they operate at high temperatures without [[moving parts]]. MHD was developed because the hot exhaust gas of an MHD generator can  heat the boilers of a [[Rankine cycle|steam]] [[power plant]], increasing overall efficiency. MHD was developed as a [[topping cycle]] to increase the efficiency of [[electric generation]], especially when burning [[coal]] or [[natural gas]]. MHD dynamos are the complement of [[Magnetohydrodynamic drive|MHD accelerators]], which have been applied to pump [[liquid metal]]s, [[seawater]] and plasmas.

An MHD generator, like a conventional generator, relies on moving a conductor through a [[magnetic field]] to generate electric current. The MHD generator uses hot conductive ionized gas (a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]) as the moving conductor.  The mechanical dynamo, in contrast, uses the motion of mechanical devices to accomplish this. MHD generators are technically practical for fossil fuels, but have been overtaken by other, less expensive technologies, such as [[combined cycle]]s in which a [[gas turbine]]'s or [[molten carbonate fuel cell]]'s exhaust heats [[steam]] to power a [[steam turbine]].

Natural MHD dynamos are an active area of research in [[plasma physics]] and are of great interest to the [[geophysics]] and [[astrophysics]] communities, since the magnetic fields of the [[earth]] and [[sun]] are produced by these natural dynamos.

==Principle==

The [[Lorentz Force Law]] describes the effects of a charged particle moving in a constant magnetic field. The simplest form of this law is given by the vector equation.
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = Q \cdot (\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B} )&lt;/math&gt;
where 
*'''F''' is the force acting on the particle.
*Q is the charge of the particle,
*'''v''' is the velocity of the particle, and
*'''B''' is the magnetic field.

The vector '''F''' is perpendicular to both ''' v''' and '''B''' according to the [[right hand rule]].

== Power generation ==

Typically, for a large-scale power station to approach the operational efficiency of [[computer model]]s, steps must be taken to increase the electrical conductivity of the conductive substance. The heating of a gas to its plasma state or the addition of other easily ionizable substances like the salts of alkali metals can accomplish this increase. In practice, a number of issues must be considered in the implementation of an '''MHD generator''': generator efficiency, economics, and toxic byproducts. These issues are affected by the choice of one of the three MHD generator designs: the Faraday generator, the Hall generator, and the disc generator.

=== Faraday generator ===
The Faraday generator is named after the man who first looked for the effect in the Thames river (see [[MHD dynamo#History|history]]). A simple Faraday generator would consist of a wedge-shaped pipe or tube of some non-[[conductive]] material. When an electrically conductive fluid flows through the tube, in the presence of a significant perpendicular magnetic field, a voltage is induced in the field, which can be drawn off as electrical power by placing the electrodes on the sides at 90 degree angles to the magnetic field.

There are limitations on the density and type of field used. The amount of power that can be extracted is proportional to the cross sectional area of the tube and the speed of the conductive flow. The conductive substance is also cooled and slowed by this process. MHD generators typically reduce the temperature of the conductive substance from plasma temperatures to just over 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.

The main practical problem of a Faraday generator is that differential voltages and currents in the fluid short through the electrodes on the sides of the duct. The most powerful waste is from the [[Hall effect]] current. This makes the Faraday duct very inefficient. Most further refinements of MHD generators have tried to solve this problem. The optimal magnetic field on duct-shaped MHD generators is a sort of saddle shape. To get this field, a large generator requires an extremely powerful magnet. Many research groups have tried to adapt superconducting magnets to this purpose, with varying success.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

=== Hall generator ===
The most common solution is to use the [[Hall effect]] to create a current that flows with the fluid. The normal scheme is to place arrays of short, vertical electrodes on the sides of the duct. The first and last electrodes in the duct power the load. Each other electrode is shorted to an electrode on the opposite side of the duct. These shorts of the Faraday current induce a powerful magnetic field within the fluid, but in a chord of a circle at right angles to the Faraday current. This secondary, induced field makes current flow in a rainbow shape between the first and last electrodes.

Losses are less than a Faraday generator, and voltages are higher because there is less shorting of the final induced current. However, this design has problems because the speed of the material flow requires the middle electrodes to be offset to "catch" the Faraday currents. As the load varies, the fluid flow speed varies, misaligning the Faraday current with its intended electrodes, and making the generator's efficiency very sensitive to its load.

=== Disc generator ===
[[File:Disk MHD generator.png|thumb|right|250px|alt=Diagram of a Disk MHD generators|Diagram of a Disk MHD generator showing current flows]]The third and, currently, the most efficient design is the Hall effect disc generator. This design currently holds the efficiency and energy density records for MHD generation. A disc generator has fluid flowing between the center of a disc, and a duct wrapped around the edge. The magnetic excitation field is made by a pair of circular [[Helmholtz coils]] above and below the disk. The Faraday currents flow in a perfect dead short around the periphery of the disk. The Hall effect currents flow between ring electrodes near the center and ring electrodes near the periphery.

Another significant advantage of this design is that the magnet is more efficient. First, it has simple parallel field lines. Second, because the fluid is processed in a disk, the magnet can be closer to the fluid, and magnetic field strengths increase as the 3rd power of distance. Finally, the generator is compact for its power, so the magnet is also smaller. The resulting magnet uses a much smaller percentage of the generated power.

=== Generator efficiency ===
The efficiency of the [[direct energy conversion]] in MHD power generation increases with the magnetic field strength and the [[Spitzer resistivity|plasma conductivity]], which depends directly on the [[Plasma (physics)#Temperature|plasma temperature]], and more precisely on the electron temperature. As very hot plasmas can only be used in pulsed MHD generators (for example using [[shock tube]]s) due to the fast thermal material erosion, it was envisaged to use [[nonthermal plasma]]s as working fluids in steady MHD generators, where only free electrons are heated a lot (10,000–20,000 [[kelvin]]s) while the main gas (neutral atoms and ions) remains at a much lower temperature, typically 2500 kelvins. The goal was to preserve the materials of the generator (walls and electrodes) while improving the limited conductivity of such poor conductors to the same level as a plasma in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], i.e. completely heated to more than 10,000 degrees, a temperature that no material could stand.&lt;ref name="Kerrebrock 1964a"&gt;{{cite journal

But [[Evgeny Velikhov]] first discovered theoretically in 1962 and experimentally in 1963 that an ionization instability, later called the Velikhov instability or [[electrothermal instability]], quickly arises in any MHD converter using [[Plasma (physics)#Magnetization|magnetized]] nonthermal plasmas with hot electrons, when a critical [[Hall effect|Hall parameter]] is reached, hence depending on the [[degree of ionization]] and the magnetic field.&lt;ref name="Velikhov 1962"&gt;

The prospects about this technology, which initially predicted awesome efficiencies, crippled MHD programs all over the world as no solution to mitigate the instability was found at that time.&lt;ref&gt;

Consequently, without implementing solutions to master the electrothermal instability, practical MHD generators had to limit the Hall parameter or use moderately heated thermal plasmas instead of cold plasmas with hot electrons, which severely lowers efficiency.

As of 1994, the 22% efficiency record for closed-cycle disc MHD generators was held by Tokyo Technical Institute. The peak enthalpy extraction in these experiments reached 30.2%. Typical open-cycle Hall &amp; duct coal MHD generators are lower, near 17%. These efficiencies make MHD unattractive, by itself, for utility power generation, since conventional [[Rankine cycle]] power plants easily reach 40%.

However, the exhaust of an MHD generator burning [[fossil fuel]] is almost as hot as the flame of a conventional steam boiler. By routing its exhaust gases into a boiler to make steam, MHD and a [[steam]] [[Rankine cycle]] can convert [[fossil fuel]]s into electricity with an estimated efficiency up to 60 percent, compared to the 40 percent of a typical coal plant.

A magnetohydrodynamic generator might also be the first stage of a gas-cooled [[nuclear reactor]].&lt;ref&gt;Blair M. Smith et al.: ''Gas Core Reactor-MHD Power System with Cascading Power Cycle''. Conference proceedings, ICAPP'02: 2002 International congress on advances in nuclear power plants, Hollywood, FL, ([http://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/21167909 abstract]).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economics ===

MHD generators have not been employed for large scale mass energy conversion because other techniques with comparable efficiency have a lower lifecycle investment cost. Advances in natural gas turbines achieved similar thermal efficiencies at lower costs, by having the turbine's exhaust drive a [[Rankine cycle]] steam plant. To get more electricity from coal, it is cheaper to simply add more low-temperature steam-generating capacity.

A coal-fueled MHD generator is a type of [[Brayton cycle|Brayton power cycle]], similar to the power cycle of a combustion turbine. However, unlike the combustion turbine, there are no moving mechanical parts; the electrically conducting plasma provides the moving electrical conductor. The side walls and electrodes merely withstand the pressure within, while the anode and cathode conductors collect the electricity that is generated. All Brayton cycles are heat engines. Ideal Brayton cycles also have an ideal efficiency equal to ideal [[Carnot cycle]] efficiency. Thus, the potential for high energy efficiency from an MHD generator. All Brayton cycles have higher potential for efficiency the higher the firing temperature. While a combustion turbine is limited in maximum temperature by the strength of its air/water or steam-cooled rotating airfoils; there are no rotating parts in an open-cycle MHD generator. This upper bound in temperature limits the energy efficiency in combustion turbines. The upper bound on Brayton cycle temperature for an MHD generator is not limited, so inherently an MHD generator has a higher potential capability for energy efficiency.

The temperatures at which linear coal-fueled MHD generators can operate are limited by factors that include: (a) the combustion fuel, oxidizer, and oxidizer preheat temperature which limit the maximum temperature of the cycle; (b) the ability to protect the sidewalls and electrodes from melting; (c) the ability to protect the electrodes from electrochemical attack from the hot slag coating the walls combined with the high current or arcs that impinge on the electrodes as they carry off the direct current from the plasma; and (d) by the capability of the electrical insulators between each electrode. Coal-fired MHD plants with oxygen/air and high oxidant preheats would probably provide potassium seeded plasmas of about 4200 deg. F, 10 atmospheres pressure, and begin expansion at Mach 1.2. These plants would recover MHD exhaust heat for oxidant preheat, and for combined cycle steam generation. With aggressive assumptions, one DOE-funded feasibility study of where the technology could go, [[1000 MWe Advanced Coal-Fired MHD/Steam Binary Cycle Power Plant Conceptual Design]], published in June 1989, showed that a large coal-fired MHD combined cycle plant could attain a HHV energy efficiency approaching 60 percent—well in excess of other coal-fueled technologies, so the potential for low operating costs exists.

However, no testing at those aggressive conditions or size has yet occurred, and there are no large MHD generators now under test. There is simply an inadequate reliability track record to provide confidence in a commercial coal-fueled MHD design.

U25B MHD testing in Russia using natural gas as fuel used a superconducting magnet, and had an output of 1.4 megawatts. A coal-fired MHD generator series of tests funded by the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)]] in 1992 produced MHD power from a larger superconducting magnet at the Component Development and Integration Facility (CDIF) in [[Butte, Montana|Butte]], [[Montana]]. None of these tests were conducted for long-enough durations to verify the commercial durability of the technology. Neither of the test facilities were in large-enough scale for a commercial unit.

Superconducting magnets are used in the larger MHD generators to eliminate one of the large parasitic losses: the power needed to energize the electromagnet. Superconducting magnets, once charged, consume no power, and can develop intense magnetic fields 4 teslas and higher. The only [[parasitic load]] for the magnets are to maintain refrigeration, and to make up the small losses for the non-supercritical connections.

Because of the high temperatures, the non-conducting walls of the channel must be constructed from an exceedingly heat-resistant substance such as [[yttrium]] oxide or [[zirconium]] dioxide to retard oxidation. Similarly, the electrodes must be both conductive and heat-resistant at high temperatures. The AVCO coal-fueled MHD generator at the CDIF was tested with water-cooled copper electrodes capped with platinum, tungsten, stainless steel, and electrically conducting ceramics.

=== Toxic byproducts ===
MHD reduces overall production of hazardous fossil fuel wastes because it increases plant efficiency. In MHD coal plants, the patented commercial "Econoseed" process developed by the U.S. (see below) recycles potassium ionization seed from the fly ash captured by the stack-gas scrubber. However, this equipment is an additional expense. If molten metal is the armature fluid of an MHD generator, care must be taken with the coolant of the electromagnetics and channel. The alkali metals commonly used as MHD fluids react violently with water. Also, the chemical byproducts of heated, electrified alkali metals and channel ceramics may be poisonous and environmentally persistent.

== History ==
The first practical MHD power research was funded in 1938 in the U.S. by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse]] in its [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] laboratories, headed by Hungarian [[Bela Karlovitz]]. The initial patent on MHD is by B. Karlovitz, U.S. Patent No. 2,210,918, "Process for the Conversion of Energy", August 13, 1940.

World War II interrupted development. In 1962, the First International Conference on MHD Power was held in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK by Dr. Brian C. Lindley of the International Research and Development Company Ltd. The group set up a steering committee to set up further conferences and disseminate ideas. In 1964, the group set up a second conference in Paris, France, in consultation with the [[European Nuclear Energy Agency]].

Since membership in the [[European Nuclear Energy Agency|ENEA]] was limited, the group persuaded the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] to sponsor a third conference, in Salzburg, Austria, July 1966. Negotiations at this meeting converted the steering committee into a periodic reporting group, the ILG-MHD (international liaison group, MHD), under the ENEA, and later in 1967, also under the International Atomic Energy Agency. Further research in the 1960s by R. Rosa established the practicality of MHD for fossil-fueled systems.

In the 1960s, AVCO Everett Aeronautical Research began a series of experiments, ending with the Mk. V generator of 1965. This generated 35 MW, but used about 8MW to drive its magnet. In 1966, the ILG-MHD had its first formal meeting in Paris, France. It began issuing a periodic status report in 1967. This pattern persisted, in this institutional form, up until 1976. Toward the end of the 1960s, interest in MHD declined because nuclear power was becoming more widely available.

In the late 1970s, as interest in nuclear power declined, interest in MHD increased. In 1975, [[UNESCO]] became persuaded the MHD might be the most efficient way to utilise world coal reserves, and in 1976, sponsored the ILG-MHD. In 1976, it became clear that no nuclear reactor in the next 25 years would use MHD, so the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and [[European Nuclear Energy Agency|ENEA]] (both nuclear agencies) withdrew support from the ILG-MHD, leaving [[UNESCO]] as the primary sponsor of the ILG-MHD.

=== Former Yugoslavia development ===
Over more than a ten-year span, engineers in former Yugoslavian Institute of Thermal and Nuclear Technology (ITEN), Energoinvest Co., Sarajevo, had built the first experimental Magneto-Hydrodynamic facility power generator in 1989. It was here it was first patented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0196890494900612 | doi=10.1016/0196-8904(94)90061-2 | volume=35 | issue=4 | title=The correct quasi-one-dimensional model of the fluid flow in a Faraday segmented MHD generator channel | year=1994 | journal=Energy Conversion and Management | pages=281–291 | last1 = Bajović | first1 = Valentina S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. development ===
In the 1980s, the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] began a vigorous multiyear program, culminating in a 1992 50MW demonstration coal combustor at the Component Development and Integration Facility (CDIF) in [[Butte, Montana]]. This program also had significant work at the Coal-Fired-In-Flow-Facility (CFIFF) at [[University of Tennessee Space Institute]].

This program combined four parts:

# An integrated MHD topping cycle, with channel, electrodes and current control units developed by AVCO, later known as Textron Defence of Boston. This system was a Hall effect duct generator heated by pulverized coal, with a potassium ionisation seed. AVCO had developed the famous Mk. V generator, and had significant experience.
# An integrated bottoming cycle, developed at the CDIF.
# A facility to regenerate the ionization seed was developed by TRW. Potassium carbonate is separated from the sulphate in the [[fly ash]] from the scrubbers. The carbonate is removed, to regain the potassium.
# A method to integrate MHD into preexisting coal plants. The Department of Energy commissioned two studies. Westinghouse Electric performed a study based on the Scholtz Plant of Gulf Power in [[Sneads, Florida]]. The MHD Development Corporation also produced a study based on the J.E. Corrette Plant of the Montana Power Company of [[Billings, Montana]].

Initial prototypes at the CDIF were operated for short durations, with various coals: Montana Rosebud, and a high-sulphur corrosive coal, Illinois No. 6. A great deal of engineering, chemistry and material science was completed. After final components were developed, operational testing completed with 4,000 hours of continuous operation, 2,000 on Montana Rosebud, 2,000 on Illinois No. 6. The testing ended in 1993.

=== Japanese development ===
The Japanese program in the late 1980s concentrated on closed-cycle MHD. The belief was that it would have higher efficiencies, and smaller equipment, especially in the clean, small, economical plant capacities near 100 megawatts (electrical) which are suited to Japanese conditions. Open-cycle coal-powered plants are generally thought to become economical above 200 megawatts.

The first major series of experiments was FUJI-1, a blow-down system powered from a shock tube at the [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]]. These experiments extracted up to 30.2% of enthalpy, and achieved power densities near 100 megawatts per cubic meter. This facility was funded by Tokyo Electric Power, other Japanese utilities, and the Department of Education. Some authorities believe this system was a disc generator with a helium and argon carrier gas and potassium ionization seed.

In 1994, there were detailed plans for FUJI-2, a 5MW (electrical) continuous closed-cycle facility, powered by natural gas, to be built using the experience of FUJI-1. The basic MHD design was to be a system with inert gases using a disk generator. The aim was an enthalpy extraction of 30% and an MHD thermal efficiency of 60%. FUJI-2 was to be followed by a retrofit to a 300 MWe natural gas plant.

=== Australian development ===
In 1986, Professor Hugo Karl Messerle at The University of Sydney researched coal-fueled MHD. This resulted in a 28 MWe topping facility that was operated outside Sydney. Messerle also wrote one of the most recent reference works (see below), as part of a UNESCO education program.

A detailed obituary for Hugo is located on the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (ATSE) website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atse.org.au/index.php?sectionid=1045 Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (ATSE) website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723020349/https://www.atse.org.au/index.php?sectionid=1045 |date=2008-07-23 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italian development ===
The Italian program began in 1989 with a budget of about 20 million $US, and had three main development areas:

# MHD Modelling.
# Superconducting magnet development. The goal in 1994 was a prototype 2 m long, storing 66 [[megajoule|MJ]], for an MHD demonstration 8 m long. The field was to be 5 [[tesla (unit)|teslas]], with a taper of 0.15 T/m. The geometry was to resemble a saddle shape, with cylindrical and rectangular windings of niobium-titanium copper.
# Retrofits to natural gas powerplants. One was to be at the Enichem-Anic factor in Ravenna. In this plant, the combustion gases from the MHD would pass to the boiler. The other was a 230 MW (thermal) installation for a power station in Brindisi, that would pass steam to the main power plant.

=== Chinese development ===
A joint U.S.-China national programme ended in 1992 by retrofitting the coal-fired No. 3 plant in Asbach.{{Citation needed|reason=Dubious, Asbach is in Germany|date=September 2017}} A further eleven-year program was approved in March 1994. This established centres of research in:

# The Institute of Electrical Engineering in its very iseful[[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], Beijing, concerned with MHD generator design.
# The [[Shanghai Power Research Institute]], concerned with overall system and superconducting magnet research.
# The Thermoenergy Research Engineering Institute at the Nanjing's [[Southeast University]], concerned with later developments.

The 1994 study proposed a 10 MW (electrical, 108 MW thermal) generator with the MHD and bottoming cycle plants connected by steam piping, so either could operate independently.

=== Russian developments ===
[[File:Modern MHD generator U25.JPG|thumb|U-25]]
In 1971 the natural-gas fired U-25 plant was completed near Moscow, with a designed capacity of 25 megawatts. By 1974 it delivered 6 megawatts of power.&lt;ref name=HANDBOOK78&gt;Donald G. ink, H. Wayne Beatty (ed), ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, 11th Edition'', Mc Graw Hill, 1978 {{ISBN|0-07-020974-X}} page 11-52&lt;/ref&gt; By 1994, Russia had developed and operated the coal-operated facility U-25, at the High-Temperature Institute of the [[Russian Academy of Science]] in Moscow. U-25's bottoming plant was actually operated under contract with the Moscow utility, and fed power into Moscow's grid. There was substantial interest in Russia in developing a coal-powered disc generator.

'''Mathematics and art''' are related in a variety of ways. [[Mathematics]] has itself been described as an [[art]] [[mathematical beauty|motivated by beauty]]. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as [[Music and mathematics|music]], [[dance]], [[painting]], [[Mathematics and architecture|architecture]], [[sculpture]], and [[Mathematics and fiber arts|textiles]]. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.

Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship. [[List of mathematical artists|Artists have used mathematics]] since the 4th century BC when the Greek [[sculpture|sculptor]] [[Polykleitos]] wrote his ''Canon'', prescribing proportions based on the ratio 1:{{radic|2}} for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the [[golden ratio]] in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian [[Renaissance]], [[Luca Pacioli]] wrote the influential treatise ''[[De Divina Proportione]]'' (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, [[Piero della Francesca]], developed [[Euclid]]'s ideas on [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] in treatises such as ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', and in his paintings. The engraver [[Albrecht Dürer]] made many references to mathematics in his work ''[[Melencolia I]]''. In modern times, the [[graphic artist]] [[M. C. Escher]] made intensive use of [[tessellation]] and [[hyperbolic geometry]], with the help of the mathematician [[H. S. M. Coxeter]], while the [[De Stijl]] movement led by [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as [[quilting]], [[knitting]], [[cross-stitch]], [[crochet]], [[embroidery]], [[weaving]], [[Turkish carpet|Turkish]] and other [[carpet]]-making, as well as [[kilim]]. In [[Islamic art]], symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian [[girih]] and Moroccan [[zellige]] tilework, [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] [[jali]] pierced stone screens, and widespread [[muqarnas]] vaulting.

Mathematics has directly influenced art with conceptual tools such as [[linear perspective]], the analysis of [[symmetry]], and mathematical objects such as [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] and the [[Möbius strip]]. [[Magnus Wenninger]] creates colourful [[stellation|stellated polyhedra]], originally as models for teaching. Mathematical concepts such as [[recursion]] and logical paradox can be seen in paintings by [[Rene Magritte]] and in engravings by M. C. Escher. [[Computer art]] often makes use of [[fractal]]s including the [[Mandelbrot set]], and sometimes explores other mathematical objects such as [[cellular automata]]. Controversially, the artist [[David Hockney]] has argued that artists from the Renaissance onwards made use of the [[camera lucida]] to draw precise representations of scenes; the architect Philip Steadman similarly argued that [[Vermeer]] used the [[camera obscura]] in his distinctively observed paintings.

Other relationships include the algorithmic analysis of artworks by [[X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]], the finding that traditional [[batik]]s from different regions of [[Java]] have distinct [[fractal dimension]]s, and stimuli to mathematics research, especially [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s theory of perspective, which eventually led to [[Girard Desargues]]'s [[projective geometry]]. A persistent view, based ultimately on the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] notion of harmony in music, holds that everything was arranged by Number, that God is the geometer of the world, and that therefore the world's [[sacred geometry|geometry is sacred]], as seen in artworks such as [[William Blake]]'s ''[[The Ancient of Days]]''.

==Origins: from Ancient Greece to the Renaissance==

{{Anchor|Polykleitos}}

===Polykleitos's ''Canon'' and ''symmetria''===
[[File:Doryphoros MAN Napoli Inv6011-2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Roman copy in marble of ''[[Doryphoros]]'', originally a bronze by [[Polykleitos]]]]
{{further information|Polykleitos}}

[[Polykleitos]] the elder (c.450–420 BC) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[sculptor]] from the school of [[Argos]], and a contemporary of [[Phidias]]. His works and statues consisted mainly of bronze and were of athletes. According to the philosopher and mathematician [[Xenocrates]], Polykleitos is ranked as one of the most important sculptors of [[Classical antiquity]] for his work on the ''[[Doryphorus]]'' and the statue of [[Hera]] in the [[Heraion of Argos]].&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stewart |first1=Andrew |title=Polykleitos of Argos," One Hundred Greek Sculptors: Their Careers and Extant Works |journal=[[Journal of Hellenic Studies]] |date=November 1978 |volume=98 |pages=122–131 |doi=10.2307/630196|jstor=630196}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his sculptures may not be as famous as those of Phidias, they are much admired. In the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos, a treatise he wrote designed to document the "perfect" [[anatomy|anatomical]] proportions of the male nude, Polykleitos gives us a mathematical approach towards sculpturing the human body.&lt;ref name=Stewart/&gt;

Polykleitos uses the [[distal phalanges|distal phalanx]] of the [[little finger]] as the basic module for determining the proportions of the human body.&lt;ref name=Tobin&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tobin, Richard |title=The ''Canon'' of Polykleitos |journal=[[American Journal of Archaeology]] |volume=79 |issue=4 |date=October 1975 |pages=307–321 |doi=10.2307/503064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polykleitos multiplies the length of the distal phalanx by the [[square root of two]] ({{radic|2}}) to get the distance of the [[intermediate phalanges|second phalanges]] and multiplies the length again by {{radic|2}} to get the length of the [[proximal phalanges|third phalanges]]. Next, he takes the [[finger]] length and multiplies that by {{radic|2}} to get the length of the palm from the base of the finger to the [[ulna]]. This [[geometric series]] of measurements progresses until Polykleitos has formed the arm, chest, body, and so on.&lt;ref name=Lawton&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lawton |first1=Arthur J. |title=Pattern, Tradition and Innovation in Vernacular Architecture |journal=Past |date=2013 |volume=36 |url=http://www.pioneeramerica.org/past2013/past2013artlawton.html |quote=The base figure is a square the length and width of the distal phalange of the little finger. Its diagonals rotated to one side transform the square to a 1 : {{radic|2}} root rectangle. In Figure 5 this rectangular figure marks the width and length of the adjacent medial phalange. Rotating the medial diagonal proportions the proximal phalange and similarly from there to the wrist, from wrist to elbow and from elbow to shoulder top. Each new step advances the diagonal's pivot point.|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos is immense in [[Classical Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], and [[Renaissance]] sculpture, many sculptors following Polykleitos's prescription. While none of Polykleitos's original works survive, Roman copies demonstrate his ideal of physical perfection and mathematical precision. Some scholars argue that [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] thought influenced the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos.&lt;ref name=Raven&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Raven |first1=J. E. |title=Polyclitus and Pythagoreanism |journal=[[Classical Quarterly]] |date=1951 |volume=1|issue=3–4 |pages=147– |doi=10.1017/s0009838800004122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Canon'' applies the basic mathematical concepts of Greek geometry, such as the ratio, proportion, and ''symmetria'' (Greek for "harmonious proportions") and turns it into a system capable of describing the human form through a series of continuous [[geometric series|geometric progressions]].&lt;ref name=Tobin/&gt;

===Perspective and proportion===
{{main article|Perspective (graphical)}}

[[File:Brunelleschi's perspective experiment.jpg|thumb|[[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]'s experiment with [[linear perspective]]]]

In classical times, rather than making distant figures smaller with [[linear perspective]], painters sized objects and figures according to their thematic importance. In the Middle Ages, some artists used [[reverse perspective]] for special emphasis. The Muslim mathematician [[Alhazen]] (Ibn al-Haytham) described a theory of optics in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' in 1021, but never applied it to art.&lt;ref name=StAndrews/&gt; The [[Renaissance]] saw a rebirth of [[Classical Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] culture and ideas, among them the study of mathematics to understand [[nature]] and the [[arts]]. Two major motives drove artists in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance towards mathematics. First, painters needed to figure out how to depict three-dimensional scenes on a two-dimensional canvas. Second, philosophers and artists alike were convinced that mathematics was the true essence of the physical world and that the entire universe, including the arts, could be explained in geometric terms.&lt;ref name=Emmer&gt;{{cite book |editor=Emmer, Michelle |title=The Visual Mind II |publisher=MIT Press |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-262-05048-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rudiments of perspective arrived with [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] (1266/7 – 1337), who attempted to draw in perspective using an algebraic method to determine the placement of distant lines. In 1415, the Italian [[architect]] [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and his friend [[Leon Battista Alberti]] demonstrated the geometrical method of applying perspective in Florence, using [[similar triangles]] as formulated by Euclid, to find the apparent height of distant objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vasari, Giorgio |authorlink=Giorgio Vasari |date=1550 |title=[[Lives of the Artists]] |publisher=Torrentino |page=Chapter on Brunelleschi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alberti |first1=Leon Battista |last2=Spencer |first2=John R. |title=On Painting |date=1956 |publisher=Yale University Press |origyear=1435|url=http://www.noteaccess.com/Texts/Alberti/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunelleschi's own perspective paintings are lost, but [[Masaccio]]'s painting of the Holy Trinity shows his principles at work.&lt;ref name=StAndrews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Field |first1=J.

The Italian painter [[Paolo Uccello]] (1397–1475) was fascinated by perspective, as shown in his paintings of ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' (c. 1435–1460): broken lances lie conveniently along perspective lines.&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/art.html |title=Polyhedra in Art |author=Hart, George W. |authorlink=George W. Hart |accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CunninghamReich2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cunningham |first1=Lawrence |last2=Reich |first2=John |last3=Fichner-Rathus |first3=Lois |title=Culture and Values: A Survey of the Western Humanities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0t0bCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA375 |date=1 January 2014 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-1-285-44932-6 |page=375 |quote=which illustrate Uccello's fascination with perspective. The jousting combatants engage on a battlefield littered with broken lances that have fallen in a near-grid pattern and are aimed toward a vanishing point somewhere in the distance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painter [[Piero della Francesca]] (c.1415–1492) exemplified this new shift in Italian Renaissance thinking. He was an expert [[mathematician]] and [[geometer]], writing books on [[solid geometry]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], including ''[[De Prospectiva Pingendi]] (On Perspective for Painting)'', ''Trattato d'Abaco (Abacus Treatise)'', and ''De corporibus regularibus (On Regular Solids)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=della Francesca, Piero |title=De Prospectiva Pingendi |editor=G. Nicco Fasola |location=Florence |year=1942 |origyear=c. 1474}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=della Francesca, Piero |title=Trattato d'Abaco |editor=G.

Mancini |year=1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Vasari]] in his ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'' calls Piero the "greatest geometer of his time, or perhaps of any time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vasari, G. |title=Le Opere, volume 2 |editor=G. Milanesi |date=1878 |page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piero's interest in perspective can be seen in his paintings including the [[Polyptych of Perugia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zuffi |first=Stefano  |title=Piero della Francesca |publisher=L'Unità – Mondadori Arte |year=1991 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''San Agostino altarpiece'' and ''[[The Flagellation of Christ]]''. His work on geometry influenced later mathematicians and artists including [[Luca Pacioli]] in his ''De Divina Proportione'' and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Piero studied classical mathematics and the works of [[Archimedes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Heath, T.L. |title=The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1908 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was taught commercial arithmetic in "abacus schools"; his writings are formatted like abacus school textbooks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Grendler, P. |title=What Piero Learned in School: Fifteenth-Century Vernacular Education |work=Piero della Francesca and His Legacy |editor=M.A. Lavin |publisher=University Press of New England |year=1995 |pages=161–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps including Leonardo Pisano ([[Fibonacci]])'s 1202 ''[[Liber Abaci]]''. [[Linear perspective]] was just being introduced into the artistic world. Alberti explained in his 1435 ''[[De pictura]]'': "light rays travel in straight lines from points in the observed scene to the eye, forming a kind of [[pyramid]] with the eye as vertex." A painting constructed with linear perspective is a [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] of that pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alberti, Leon Battista |title=On Painting |editor= Kemp, Martin |author2=Grayson, Cecil (trans.) |publisher=Penguin Classics |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', Piero transforms his empirical observations of the way aspects of a figure change with point of view into mathematical proofs. His treatise starts in the vein of Euclid: he defines the point as "the tiniest thing that is possible for the eye to comprehend".{{efn|In Piero's Italian: "una cosa tanto picholina quanto e possible ad ochio comprendere".}}&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt; He uses [[deductive logic]] to lead the reader to the perspective representation of a three-dimensional body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Peterson, Mark |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/mac/Italian/geometry.shtml |title=The Geometry of Piero della Francesca |quote=In Book I, after some elementary constructions to introduce the idea of the apparent size of an object being actually its angle subtended at the eye, and referring to Euclid's Elements Books I and VI, and Euclid's Optics, he turns, in Proposition 13, to the representation of a square lying flat on the ground in front of the viewer. What should the artist actually draw? After this, objects are constructed in the square (tilings, for example, to represent a tiled floor), and corresponding objects are constructed in perspective; in Book II prisms are erected over these planar objects, to represent houses, columns, etc.; but the basis of the method is the original square, from which everything else follows.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[David Hockney]] [[Hockney-Falco thesis|argued]] in his book ''[[Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters]]'' that artists started using a [[camera lucida]] from the 1420s, resulting in a sudden change in precision and realism, and that this practice was continued by major artists including [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[Jan van Eyck|Van Eyck]], and [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hockney |first=David |title=Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters |year=2006 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-28638-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics disagree on whether Hockney was correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Van Riper |first1=Frank |title=Hockney's 'Lucid' Bomb At the Art Establishment |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/photo/essays/vanRiper/030220.htm |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marr |first1=Andrew |title=What the eye didn't see |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/oct/07/featuresreview.review1 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=7 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the architect Philip Steadman argued controversially&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Janson |first1=Jonathan |title=An Interview with Philip Steadman |url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/interviews_newsletter/steadman_interview.html#.VeqxKJdUWHg |publisher=Essential Vermeer |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=25 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Vermeer]] had used a different device, the [[camera obscura]], to help him create his distinctively observed paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steadman |first1=Philip |title=Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth Behind the Masterpieces |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-280302-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1509, [[Luca Pacioli]] (c. 1447–1517) published ''[[De divina proportione]]'' on [[mathematical]] and [[artistic]] [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]], including in the human face. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) illustrated the text with woodcuts of regular solids while he studied under Pacioli in the 1490s. Leonardo's drawings are probably the first illustrations of skeletonic solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/pacioli.html |title=Luca Pacioli's Polyhedra |author=Hart, George |authorlink=George W. Hart |accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These, such as the [[rhombicuboctahedron]], were among the first to be drawn to demonstrate perspective by being overlaid on top of each other. The work discusses perspective in the works of [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Melozzo da Forlì]], and [[Marco Palmezzano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Morris |first1=Roderick Conway |title=Palmezzano's Renaissance:From shadows, painter emerges |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/27/arts/27iht-conway.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=22 July 2015 |date=27 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Da Vinci studied Pacioli's ''Summa'', from which he copied tables of proportions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit14/unit14.html |author=Calter, Paul |title=Geometry and Art Unit 1 |publisher=[[Dartmouth College]] |accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' and ''[[The Last Supper]]'', Da Vinci's work incorporated linear perspective with a [[vanishing point]] to provide apparent depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brizio, Anna Maria |title=Leonardo the Artist |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Last Supper]]'' is constructed in a tight ratio of 12:6:4:3, as is [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens]]'', which includes Pythagoras with a tablet of ideal ratios, sacred to the Pythagoreans.&lt;ref name="Ladwein2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ladwein |first=Michael |title=Leonardo Da Vinci, the Last Supper: A Cosmic Drama and an Act of Redemption |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wMFem_x1M04C&amp;pg=PA62 |year=2006 |publisher=Temple Lodge Publishing |isbn=978-1-902636-75-7|pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Turner, Richard A. |title=Inventing Leonardo |publisher=Alfred A.

As early as the 15th century, [[curvilinear perspective]] found its way into paintings by artists interested in image distortions. [[Jan van Eyck]]'s 1434 ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' contains a convex mirror with reflections of the people in the scene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Criminisi, A. |author2=Kempz, M. |author3=Kang, S.

Three-dimensional space can be represented convincingly in art, as in [[technical drawing]], by means other than perspective. [[Oblique projection]]s, including cavalier perspective (used by French military artists to depict fortifications in the 18th century), were used continuously and ubiquitously by Chinese artists from the first or second centuries until the 18th century. The Chinese acquired the technique from India, which acquired it from Ancient Rome. Oblique projection is seen in Japanese art, such as in the [[Ukiyo-e]] paintings of [[Torii Kiyonaga]] (1752–1815).&lt;ref name=Cucker269&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=269–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x^3=x+1\,&lt;/math&gt;,

an irrational number which is approximately 1.325. According to the architect [[Richard Padovan]], this has characteristic ratios {{sfrac|3|4}} and {{sfrac|1|7}}, which govern the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another.

===Planar symmetries===

[[File:Carpet with Double Medallion.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Powerful presence:&lt;ref name=Salingaros/&gt; carpet with double medallion. Central [[Anatolia]] (Konya – Karapınar), turn of the 16th/17th centuries. [[Alâeddin Mosque]]]]

[[Planar symmetry|Planar symmetries]] have for millennia been exploited in artworks such as [[carpet]]s, lattices, textiles and tilings.&lt;ref name=Cucker89/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lerner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellison/&gt;&lt;ref name=Castera/&gt;

Many traditional rugs, whether pile carpets or flatweave [[kilim]]s, are divided into a central field and a framing border; both can have symmetries, though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details, variations of pattern and shifts in colour introduced by the weaver.&lt;ref name=Cucker89&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=89–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; In kilims from [[Anatolia]], the [[motif (textile arts)|motifs]] used are themselves usually symmetrical. The general layout, too, is usually present, with arrangements such as stripes, stripes alternating with rows of motifs, and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs. The field is commonly laid out as a wallpaper with a [[wallpaper group]] such as pmm, while the border may be laid out as a frieze of [[frieze group]] pm11, pmm2 or pma2. Turkish and Central Asian kilims often have three or more borders in different frieze groups. Weavers certainly had the intention of symmetry, without explicit knowledge of its mathematics.&lt;ref name=Cucker89/&gt;
The mathematician and architectural theorist [[Nikos Salingaros]] suggests that the "powerful presence"&lt;ref name=Salingaros/&gt; (aesthetic effect) of a "great carpet"&lt;ref name=Salingaros/&gt; such as the best Konya two-medallion carpets of the 17th century is created by mathematical techniques related to the theories of the architect [[Christopher Alexander]]. These techniques include making opposites couple; opposing colour values; differentiating areas geometrically, whether by using complementary shapes or balancing the directionality of sharp angles; providing small-scale complexity (from the knot level upwards) and both small- and large-scale symmetry; repeating elements at a hierarchy of different scales (with a ratio of about 2.7 from each level to the next). Salingaros argues that "all successful carpets satisfy at least nine of the above ten rules", and suggests that it might be possible to create a metric from these rules.&lt;ref name=Salingaros&gt;{{cite journal |author=Salingaros, Nikos |title=The 'life' of a carpet: an application of the Alexander rules |url=http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/life.carpet.html |journal=8th International Conference on Oriental Carpets |location=Philadelphia |date=November 1996}} Reprinted in {{cite book |editor1-last=Eiland |editor1-first=M. |editor2-last=Pinner |editor2-first=M. |title=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies V |date=1998 |publisher=Conference on Oriental Carpets |location=Danville, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic art]] [[Islamic geometric patterns|exploits symmetries]] in many of its artforms, notably in [[girih tiles|girih]] tilings. These are formed using a set of five tile shapes, namely a regular decagon, an elongated hexagon, a bow tie, a rhombus, and a regular pentagon. All the sides of these tiles have the same length; and all their angles are multiples of 36° (π/5 [[radian]]s), offering fivefold and tenfold symmetries. The tiles are decorated with [[strapwork]] lines (girih), generally more visible than the tile boundaries. In 2007, the physicists [[Peter Lu]] and [[Paul Steinhardt]]  argued that girih resembled [[quasicrystalline]] [[Penrose tiling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lu, Peter J. |author2=Steinhardt, Paul J. |year=2007 |title=Decagonal and Quasi-crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=315 |pages=1106–1110 |doi=10.1126/science.1135491 |pmid=17322056 |issue=5815 |bibcode=2007Sci...315.1106L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborate geometric [[zellige]] tilework is a distinctive element in [[Morocco|Moroccan]] architecture.&lt;ref name=Castera&gt;{{cite book |last1=Castera |first1=Jean Marc |last2=Peuriot |first2=Francoise |title=Arabesques.

===Polyhedra===
[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|The first printed illustration of a [[rhombicuboctahedron]], by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], published in ''[[De Divina Proportione]]'', 1509]]

The [[Platonic solid]]s and other [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] are a recurring theme in Western art. They are found, for instance, in a marble mosaic featuring the [[small stellated dodecahedron]], attributed to Paolo Uccello, in the floor of the [[San Marco di Venezia|San Marco Basilica]] in Venice;&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; in Leonardo da Vinci's diagrams of regular polyhedra drawn as illustrations for [[Luca Pacioli]]'s 1509 book ''The Divine Proportion'';&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; as a glass [[rhombicuboctahedron]] in Jacopo de Barbari's portrait of Pacioli, painted in 1495;&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; in the truncated polyhedron (and various other mathematical objects) in [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s engraving [[Melencolia I]];&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; and in [[Salvador Dalí]]'s painting ''The Last Supper'' in which Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant [[dodecahedron]].

[[Albrecht Dürer]] (1471–1528) was a [[German people|German]] [[Renaissance]] [[printmaker]] who made important contributions to polyhedral literature in his 1525 book, ''Underweysung der Messung (Education on Measurement)'', meant to teach the subjects of [[linear perspective]], [[geometry]] in [[architecture]], [[Platonic solids]], and [[regular polygons]]. Dürer was likely influenced by the works of [[Luca Pacioli]] and [[Piero della Francesca]] during his trips to [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Panofsky, E. |title=The Life and Art of Albrecht Durer |publisher=Princeton |year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the examples of perspective in ''Underweysung der Messung'' are underdeveloped and contain inaccuracies, there is a detailed discussion of polyhedra. Dürer is also the first to introduce in text the idea of [[Net (polyhedron)|polyhedral nets]], polyhedra unfolded to lie flat for printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hart, George W. |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/durer.html |title=Dürer's Polyhedra |accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dürer published another influential book on [[human proportions]] called ''Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion (Four Books on Human Proportion)'' in 1528.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dürer |first1=Albrecht |title=Hierinn sind begriffen vier Bucher von menschlicher Proportion|url=https://archive.org/details/hierinnsindbegri00dure |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=24 June 2015 |location=Nurenberg |date=1528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fractal dimensions===

[[File:Batik pedalaman - parang klithik.JPG|thumb|[[Batik]]s from [[Surakarta]], Java, like this ''parang klithik'' sword pattern, have a [[fractal dimension]] between 1.2 and 1.5.]]

Traditional Indonesian wax-resist [[batik]] designs on cloth combine [[representation (arts)|representational]] motifs (such as floral and vegetal elements) with abstract and somewhat chaotic elements, including imprecision in applying the wax resist, and random variation introduced by cracking of the wax. Batik designs have a [[fractal dimension]] between 1 and 2, varying in different regional styles. For example, the batik of [[Cirebon]] has a fractal dimension of 1.1; the batiks of [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Surakarta]] (Solo) in Central [[Java]] have a fractal dimension of 1.2 to 1.5; and the batiks of [[Rembang Regency|Lasem]] on the north coast of Java and of [[Tasikmalaya]] in West Java have a fractal dimension between 1.5 and 1.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lukman |first1=Muhamad |last2=Hariadi |first2=Yun |last3=Destiarmand |first3=Achmad Haldani |title=Batik Fractal : Traditional Art to Modern Complexity |journal=Proceeding Generative Art X, Milan, Italy |date=2007 |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/36748400/32.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1474897246&amp;Signature=kXmu3pdTrpZ1pkw8CLV3GHNR%2FVs%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DBatik_Fractal_Traditional_Art_to_Modern.pdf |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[drip painting]] works of the modern artist [[Jackson Pollock]] are similarly distinctive in their fractal dimension. His 1948 ''Number 14'' has a coastline-like dimension of 1.45, while his later paintings had successively higher fractal dimensions and accordingly more elaborate patterns. One of his last works, ''Blue Poles'', took six months to create, and has the fractal dimension of 1.72.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ouellette |first1=Jennifer |title=Pollock's Fractals |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2001/nov/featpollock |accessdate=26 September 2016 |agency=Discover Magazine |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The astronomer [[Galileo Galilei]] in his ''[[Il Saggiatore]]'' wrote that "[The universe] is written in [[patterns in nature|the language of mathematics]], and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Galilei, Galileo |authorlink=Galileo Galilei |title=The Assayer |year=1623}}, as translated in {{cite book |author=Drake, Stillman |authorlink=Stillman Drake  |year=1957 |title=Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo |publisher=Doubleday |pages=237–238 |isbn=0-385-09239-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists who strive and seek to study nature must first, in Galileo's view, fully understand mathematics. Mathematicians, conversely, have sought to interpret and analyse art through the lens of geometry and rationality. The mathematician Felipe Cucker suggests that mathematics, and especially geometry, is a source of rules for "rule-driven artistic creation", though not the only one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the many strands of the resulting complex relationship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; are described below.

[[File:Ghhardy@72.jpg|thumb|upright|The mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]] defined a set of criteria for [[mathematical beauty]].]]

===Mathematics as an art===
{{main article|Mathematical beauty}}

The mathematician Jerry P. King describes mathematics as an art, stating that "the keys to mathematics are beauty and elegance and not dullness and technicality", and that beauty is the motivating force for mathematical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; King cites the mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]]'s 1940 essay ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]''. In it, Hardy discusses why he finds two theorems of [[classical antiquity|classical times]] as first rate, namely [[Euclid]]'s proof there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and the proof that the square root of 2 is [[irrational number|irrational]]. King evaluates this last against Hardy's criteria for [[mathematical beauty|mathematical elegance]]: "''seriousness, depth, generality, unexpectedness, inevitability'', and ''economy''" (King's italics), and describes the proof as "aesthetically pleasing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=135–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] agreed that mathematics possessed beauty but considered the reasons beyond explanation: "Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] beautiful. If you don't see why, someone can't tell you. I ''know'' numbers are beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Devlin |first=Keith |title=The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved And Why Numbers Are Like Gossip |publisher=Basic Books |year=2000 |page=140 |chapter=Do Mathematicians Have Different Brains? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJdmfYEaLG4C |isbn=978-0-465-01619-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[Richard Wright]] argues that mathematical objects that can be constructed can be seen either "as processes to simulate phenomena" or as works of "[[computer art]]". He considers the nature of mathematical thought, observing that [[fractals]] were known to mathematicians for a century before they were recognised as such. Wright concludes by stating that it is appropriate to subject mathematical objects to any methods used to "come to terms with cultural artifacts like art, the tension between objectivity and subjectivity, their metaphorical meanings and the character of representational systems." He gives as instances an image from the [[Mandelbrot set]], an image generated by a [[cellular automaton]] algorithm, and a [[rendering (computer graphics)|computer-rendered]] image, and discusses, with reference to the [[Turing test]], whether [[algorithm]]ic products can be art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Richard |title=Some Issues in the Development of Computer Art as a Mathematical Art Form |journal=[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]] |date=1988 |volume=1 |issue=Electronic Art, supplemental issue |pages=103–110 |doi=10.2307/1557919 |jstor=1557919}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sasho Kalajdzievski's ''Math and Art: An Introduction to Visual Mathematics'' takes a similar approach, looking at suitably visual mathematics topics such as tilings, fractals and hyperbolic geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kalajdzievski |first1=Sasho |title=Math and Art: An Introduction to Visual Mathematics |date=2008 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |isbn=978-1-58488-913-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Maurice Princet joined us often&amp;nbsp;... it was as an artist that he conceptualized mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked ''n''-dimensional continuums. He loved to get the artists interested in the [[Schlegel diagram|new views on space]] that had been opened up by [[Victor Schlegel|Schlegel]] and some others.

Man Ray photographed some of the mathematical models in the [[Institut Henri Poincaré]] in Paris, including ''Objet mathematique'' (Mathematical object). He noted that this represented [[Enneper surface]]s with constant [[negative curvature]], derived from the [[pseudo-sphere]]. This mathematical foundation was important to him, as it allowed him to deny that the object was "abstract", instead claiming that it was as real as the urinal that Duchamp made into a work of art. Man Ray admitted that the object's [Enneper surface] formula "meant nothing to me, but the forms themselves were as varied and authentic as any in nature."

The artists [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] founded the [[De Stijl]] movement, which they wanted to "establish a visual vocabulary {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} elementary geometrical forms comprehensible by all and adaptable to any discipline".&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/d/de-stijl |title=De Stijl |accessdate=11 September 2015 |work=Tate Glossary |publisher=The Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Curl |first=James Stevens |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=2006 |edition=Second |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of their artworks visibly consist of ruled squares and triangles, sometimes also with circles. De Stijl artists worked in painting, furniture, interior design and architecture.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; After the breakup of De Stijl, Van Doesburg founded the [[Avant-garde]] [[Art Concret]] movement, describing his 1929–1930 ''[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Theo_van_Doesburg_218.jpg Arithmetic Composition]'', a series of four black squares on the diagonal of a squared background, as "a structure that can be controlled, a ''definite'' surface without chance elements or individual caprice", yet "not lacking in spirit, not lacking the universal and not&amp;nbsp;... empty as there is ''everything'' which fits the internal rhythm". The art critic Gladys Fabre observes that two progressions are at work in the painting, namely the growing black squares and the alternating backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tubbs, Robert |title=Mathematics in Twentieth-Century Literature and Art: Content, Form, Meaning  |year=2014 |publisher=JHU Press |pages=44–47 |isbn=978-1-4214-1402-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematics of [[tessellation]], polyhedra, shaping of space, and self-reference provided the graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] (1898—1972) with a lifetime's worth of materials for his woodcuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/ggescher/ggescher-main1.html |title=Tour: M.C.

Escher used irregular polygons when tiling the plane and often used reflections, [[glide reflection]]s, and [[Translation (geometry)|translations]] to obtain further patterns. Many of his works contain impossible constructions, made using geometrical objects which set up a contradiction between perspective projection and three dimensions, but are pleasant to the human sight. Escher's ''[[Ascending and Descending]]'' is based on the "[[Penrose stairs|impossible staircase]]" created by the medical scientist [[Lionel Penrose]] and his son the mathematician [[Roger Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Penrose |first1=L.S. |last2=Penrose |first2=R. |title=Impossible objects: A special type of visual illusion |journal=[[British Journal of Psychology]] |year=1958 |volume=49 |pages=31–33 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1958.tb00634.x |pmid=13536303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kirousis |first1=Lefteris M. |last2=Papadimitriou |first2=Christos H. |author2-link=Christos Papadimitriou |title=The complexity of recognizing polyhedral scenes |doi=10.1109/sfcs.1985.59 |pages=175–185 |work=[[Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science|26th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science]] (FOCS 1985) |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=Martin |contribution=Tractability of Drawing Interpretation |doi=10.1007/978-1-84800-229-6_9 |isbn=978-1-84800-229-6 |pages=217–230 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |title=Line Drawing Interpretation |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Escher's many tessellation drawings were inspired by conversations with the mathematician [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] on [[hyperbolic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roberts, Siobhan |authorlink=Siobhan Roberts|work=King of Infinite Space: Donald Coxeter, the Man Who Saved Geometry |page=Chapter 11 |title='Coxetering' with M.C. Escher |publisher=Walker |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escher was especially interested in five specific polyhedra, which appear many times in his work. The [[Platonic solids]]—tetrahedrons, cubes, octahedrons, dodecahedrons, and icosahedrons—are especially prominent in ''Order and Chaos'' and ''Four Regular Solids''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Escher, M.C. |title=The World of MC Escher |publisher=Random House |date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stellated figures often reside within another figure which further distorts the viewing angle and conformation of the polyhedrons and provides a multifaceted perspective artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Escher, M.C. |author2=Vermeulen, M.W. |author3=Ford, K. |title=Escher on Escher: Exploring the Infinite |year=1989 |publisher=HN Abrams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visual intricacy of mathematical structures such as tessellations and polyhedra have inspired a variety of mathematical artworks. [[Stewart Coffin]] makes polyhedral puzzles in rare and beautiful woods; [[George W. Hart]] works on the theory of [[polyhedra]] and sculpts objects inspired by them; [[Magnus Wenninger]] makes "especially beautiful" models of [[List of Wenninger polyhedron models|complex stellated polyhedra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Malkevitch |first1=Joseph |title=Mathematics and Art. 5.

The distorted perspectives of [[anamorphosis]] have been explored in art since the sixteenth century, when [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] incorporated a severely distorted skull in his 1533 painting ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]''. Many artists since then, including Escher, have make use of anamorphic tricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marcolli, Matilde |authorlink=Matilde Marcolli |title=The notion of Space in Mathematics through the lens of Modern Art |publisher=Century Books |date=July 2016 |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/SpaceMathArticle.pdf |pages=23–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematics of [[topology]] has inspired several artists in modern times. The sculptor [[John Robinson (sculptor)|John Robinson]] (1935–2007) created works such as ''Gordian Knot'' and ''Bands of Friendship'', displaying [[knot theory]] in polished bronze.&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt; Other works by Robinson explore the topology of [[torus]]es.

Modelling is far from the only possible way to illustrate mathematical concepts. Giotto's ''[[Stefaneschi Triptych]]'', 1320, illustrates [[recursion]] in the form of ''[[mise en abyme]]''; the central panel of the triptych contains, lower left, the kneeling figure of Cardinal Stefaneschi, holding up the triptych as an offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Giotto di Bondone and assistants: Stefaneschi triptych |url=http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/PIN/PIN_Sala02_03.html |publisher=The Vatican |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giorgio Chirico]]'s [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] paintings such as his 1917 ''Great Metaphysical Interior'' explore the question of levels of representation in art by depicting paintings within his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=337–338 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art can exemplify logical paradoxes, as in some paintings by the [[surrealist]] [[René Magritte]], which can be read as [[semiotic]] jokes about confusion between levels. In ''[[The Human Condition (painting)|La condition humaine]]'' (1933), Magritte depicts an easel (on the real canvas), seamlessly supporting a view through a window which is framed by "real" curtains in the painting. Similarly, Escher's ''[[Print Gallery (M. C. Escher)|Print Gallery]]'' (1956) is a print which depicts a distorted city which contains a gallery which [[recursive]]ly contains the picture, and so ''[[ad infinitum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cooper |first1=Jonathan |title=Art and Mathematics |url=http://www.doctordada.com/art/art-and-mathematics/ |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magritte made use of spheres and cuboids to distort reality in a different way, painting them alongside an assortment of houses in his 1931 ''Mental Arithmetic'' as if they were children's building blocks, but house-sized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hofstadter |first1=Douglas R. |authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter |title=Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid |titlelink=Gödel, Escher, Bach |date=1980 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-028920-6 |page=627}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' observed that the "eerie toytown image" prophesied [[Modernism]]'s usurpation of "cosy traditional forms", but also plays with the human tendency to seek [[patterns in nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hall |first1=James |title=René Magritte: The Pleasure Principle – exhibition |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jun/10/rene-magritte-pleasure-principle-exhibition |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salvador Dalí's last painting, ''[[The Swallow's Tail]]'' (1983), was part of a series inspired by [[René Thom]]'s [[catastrophe theory]].&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Elliott |editor1-last=Ades |editor1-first=Dawn |title=Dali |date=2004 |publisher=Bompiani Arte |location=Milan |pages=418–421}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish painter and sculptor [[Pablo Palazuelo]] (1916–2007) focused on the investigation of form. He developed a style that he described as the geometry of life and the geometry of all nature. Consisting of simple geometric shapes with detailed patterning and coloring, in works such as ''Angular I'' and ''Automnes'', Palazuelo expressed himself in geometric transformations.&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt;

Artists, however, do not necessarily take geometry literally. As [[Douglas Hofstadter]] writes in his 1980 reflection on human thought, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', by way of (among other things) the mathematics of art: "The difference between an Escher drawing and [[non-Euclidean geometry]] is that in the latter, comprehensible interpretations can be found for the undefined terms, resulting in a comprehensible total system, whereas for the former, the end result is not reconcilable with one's conception of the world, no matter how long one stares at the pictures." Hofstadter discusses the seemingly [[paradox]]ical lithograph ''Print Gallery'' by M. C. Escher; it depicts a seaside town containing an art gallery which seems to contain a painting of the seaside town, there being a "strange loop, or tangled hierarchy" to the levels of reality in the image. The artist himself, Hofstadter observes, is not seen; his reality and his relation to the lithograph are not paradoxical.&lt;ref name=GEB&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hofstadter |first1=Douglas R. |authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter |title=Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid |titlelink=Gödel, Escher, Bach |date=1980 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-394-74502-2 |pages=98–99, 690–717}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image's central void has also attracted the interest of mathematicians Bart de Smit and [[Hendrik Lenstra]], who propose that it could contain a [[Droste effect]] copy of itself, rotated and shrunk; this would be a further illustration of recursion beyond that noted by Hofstadter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=de Smit |first=B. |title=The Mathematical Structure of Escher's Print Gallery |year=2003 |journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=446–451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LenstraWebsite&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lenstra |first1=Hendrik |last2=De Smit |first2=Bart |title=Applying mathematics to Escher's Print Gallery |url=http://escherdroste.math.leidenuniv.nl/index.php?menu=intro |publisher=Leiden University |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis of art history===

Algorithmic analysis of images of artworks, for example using [[X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]], can reveal information about art. Such techniques can uncover images in layers of paint later covered over by an artist; help art historians to visualize an artwork before it cracked or faded; help to tell a copy from an original, or distinguish the brushstroke style of a master from those of his apprentices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stanek |first1=Becca |title=Van Gogh and the Algorithm: How Math Can Save Art |url=http://time.com/2884058/math-art-van-gogh-duke/ |publisher=Time Magazine |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sipics |first1=Michelle |title=The Van Gogh Project: Art Meets Mathematics in Ongoing International Study |url=https://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=1568 |publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is highly unlikely, therefore, that Pollock consciously understood the fractals he was painting. Nevertheless, his introduction of fractals was deliberate. For example, the colour of the anchor layer was chosen to produce the sharpest contrast against the canvas background and this layer also occupies more canvas space than the other layers, suggesting that Pollock wanted this highly fractal anchor layer to visually dominate the painting. Furthermore, after the paintings were completed, he would dock the canvas to remove regions near the canvas edge where the pattern density was less uniform. |doi=10.1088/2058-7058/12/10/21 |volume=12 |pages=25–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Max Ernst painted [[Lissajous figures]] directly by swinging a punctured bucket of paint over a canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/12307/WPIAAD_vol2_king.pdf |title=From Max Ernst to Ernst Mach: epistemology in art and science. |last=King |first=M. |date=2002 |accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The computer scientist [[Neil Dodgson]] investigated whether [[Bridget Riley]]'s stripe paintings could be characterised mathematically, concluding that while separation distance could "provide some characterisation" and global [[entropy]] worked on some paintings, [[autocorrelation]] failed as Riley's patterns were irregular. Local entropy worked best, and correlated well with the description given by the art critic Robert Kudielka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dodgson |first1=N. A. |title=Mathematical characterisation of Bridget Riley's stripe paintings |journal=[[Journal of Mathematics and the Arts]] |date=2012 |volume=5 |pages=1–21 |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nad10/pubs/jma12.pdf |quote=over the course [of] the early 1980s, Riley's patterns moved from more regular to more random (as characterised by global entropy), without losing their rhythmic structure (as characterised by local entropy). This reflects Kudielka's description of her artistic development. |doi=10.1080/17513472.2012.679468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American mathematician [[George Birkhoff]]'s 1933 ''Aesthetic Measure'' proposes a quantitative metric of the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic quality]] of an artwork. It does not attempt to measure the connotations of a work, such as what a painting might mean, but is limited to the "elements of order" of a polygonal figure. Birkhoff first combines (as a sum) five such elements: whether there is a vertical axis of symmetry; whether there is optical equilibrium; how many rotational symmetries it has; how wallpaper-like the figure is; and whether there are unsatisfactory features such as having two vertices too close together. This metric, ''O'', takes a value between −3 and 7. The second metric, ''C'', counts elements of the figure, which for a polygon is the number of different straight lines containing at least one of its sides. Birkhoff then defines his aesthetic measure of an object's beauty as ''O/C''. This can be interpreted as a balance between the pleasure looking at the object gives, and the amount of effort needed to take it in. Birkhoff's proposal has been criticized in various ways, not least for trying to put beauty in a formula, but he never claimed to have done that.&lt;ref name=Cucker116&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=116–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stimuli to mathematical research===

{{further information|Projective geometry|Mathematics of paper folding}}

Art has sometimes stimulated the development of mathematics, as when Brunelleschi's theory of perspective in architecture and painting started a cycle of research that led to the work of [[Brook Taylor]] and [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] on the mathematical foundations of perspective drawing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Treibergs |first1=Andrejs |title=The Geometry of Perspective Drawing on the Computer |url=http://www.math.utah.edu/~treiberg/Perspect/Perspect.htm |publisher=University of Utah |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=24 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately to the mathematics of [[projective geometry]] of [[Girard Desargues]] and [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=xviii |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illusion to Op art===
{{further information|Op art}}

[[File:Fraser spiral.svg|thumb|upright|The [[Fraser spiral illusion]], named for Sir James Fraser who discovered it in 1908.]]

[[Optical illusion]]s such as the [[Fraser spiral illusion|Fraser spiral]] strikingly demonstrate limitations in human visual perception, creating what the [[art historian]] [[Ernst Gombrich]] called a "baffling trick." The black and white ropes that appear to form [[spiral]]s are in fact [[concentric circle]]s. The mid-twentieth century [[Op art|Op art or optical art]] style of painting and graphics exploited such effects to create the impression of movement and flashing or vibrating patterns seen in the work of artists such as [[Bridget Riley]]&lt;!--slight overlink seems sensible here--&gt;, Spyros Horemis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=163–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Vasarely]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=406–410 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacred geometry===
{{further information|Sacred geometry|Mathematics and music}}

A strand of art from Ancient Greece onwards sees God as the geometer of the world, and the world's geometry therefore as sacred. The belief that God created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins. [[Plutarch]] attributed the belief to [[Plato]], writing that "Plato said God geometrizes continually" (''Convivialium disputationum'', liber 8,2). This image has influenced Western thought ever since. The Platonic concept derived in its turn from a [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] notion of harmony in music, where the notes were spaced in perfect proportions, corresponding to the lengths of the lyre's strings; indeed, the Pythagoreans held that everything was arranged by Number. In the same way, in Platonic thought, the [[Platonic solid|regular or Platonic solids]] dictate the proportions found in nature, and in art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ghyka |first1=Matila |title=The Geometry of Art and Life |date=2003 |publisher=Dover |isbn=978-0-486-23542-4 |pages=ix–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lawlor |first1=Robert |title=Sacred Geometry: Philosophy and Practice |date=1982 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-81030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Mediaeval manuscript illustration may refer to a verse in the Old Testament: "When he established the heavens I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the deep" (Proverbs 8:27), showing God drawing out the universe with a pair of compasses.&lt;ref name=Calter&gt;{{cite web |last1=Calter |first1=Paul |title=Celestial Themes in Art &amp; Architecture |url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit10/unit10.html |publisher=Dartmouth College |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1596, the mathematical astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] modelled the universe as a set of nested Platonic solids, determining the relative sizes of the orbits of the planets.&lt;ref name=Calter/&gt; [[William Blake]]'s ''Ancient of Days'' and his painting of the physicist [[Isaac Newton]], naked and drawing with a compass, attempt to depict the contrast between the mathematically perfect spiritual world and the imperfect physical world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Thought of a Thought – Edgar Allan Poe |url=http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath522/kmath522.htm |publisher=MathPages |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in a different way does [[Salvador Dalí]]'s 1954 ''[[Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)]]'', which depicts the cross as a [[hypercube]], representing the divine perspective with four dimensions rather than the usual three.&lt;ref name=CorpusHypercubus /&gt; In Dali's ''[[The Sacrament of the Last Supper]]'' (1955) Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant [[dodecahedron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Livio |first1=Mario |authorlink=Mario Livio |title=The golden ratio and aesthetics |url=https://plus.maths.org/content/golden-ratio-and-aesthetics |accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Scott Luce Window Malmesbury Abbey.jpg|thumb|A Morris &amp; Co. [[stained glass window]] to a design by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] installed in [[Malmesbury Abbey]]. The window shows characteristic themes based on [[King Arthur|Arthurian legends]].]]

'''Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co.''' (1861–1875) was a [[furniture|furnishings]] and [[decorative arts]] manufacturer and retailer founded by the artist and designer [[William Morris]] with friends from the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]]. With its successor '''Morris &amp; Co.''' (1875–1940) the firm's [[Middle Ages|medieval]]-inspired aesthetic and respect for [[craft|hand-craftsmanship]] and traditional [[textile arts]] had a profound influence on the decoration of churches and houses into the early 20th century.

Although its most influential period was during the flourishing of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] in the 1880s and 1890s, Morris &amp; Co. remained in operation in a limited fashion from [[World War I]] until its closure in 1940.  The firm's designs are still sold today under licences given to [[Sanderson and Sons]] part of the [[Walker Greenbank]] wallpaper and fabrics business (which owns the "Morris &amp; Co." brand&lt;ref&gt;http://www.walkergreenbank.com/morris-and-co-anniversary.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty of London]].

==Early years==
[[File:William Morris design for Trellis wallpaper 1862.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Design for ''Trellis'' wallpaper, 1862]]

Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co., "Fine Art Workmen in Painting, Carving, Furniture and the Metals," was jointly created by Morris, [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[Charles Joseph Faulkner|Charles Faulkner]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Peter Paul Marshall|P. P. Marshall]], and [[Philip Webb]] in 1861 to create and sell medieval-inspired, handcrafted items for the home.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;''Dictionary of National Biography'', 1901, "William Morris"&lt;/ref&gt; The  prospectus set forth that the firm would undertake carving, [[stained glass]],  metal-work, paper-hangings, [[chintz]]es (printed fabrics), and [[carpet]]s.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Morris, William |volume=18 |pages=871–873 |first=Arthur |last=Waugh }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first headquarters of the firm were at 8 [[Red Lion Square]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The work shown by the firm at the [[1862 International Exhibition]] attracted much notice, and within a few years it was flourishing. In the autumn of 1864 a severe illness obliged Morris to choose between giving up his home at [[Red House (London)|Red House]] in Kent and giving up his work in London. With great reluctance he gave up Red House, and in 1865 established himself under the same roof with his workshops, now relocated to larger premises in Queen Square, [[Bloomsbury]].&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt;

The decoration of churches was from the first an important part of the business. A great wave of church-building and remodelling by the [[Church of England]] in the 1840s and 1850s increased the demand for ecclesiastical decoration of all kinds, especially stained glass.  But this market shrank in the general depression of the later 1860s, and the firm increasingly turned to secular commissions.&lt;ref name="Bus"&gt;Charles Harvey and Jon Press, "The Businessman." in Parry, ''William Morris'', pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;  On its non-ecclesiastical side, the product line was extended to include, besides painted windows and mural decoration, furniture, metal and glass wares, cloth and paper wall-hangings, [[embroidery|embroideries]], [[jewellery]], woven and knotted carpets, [[silk]] [[damask]]s, and [[tapestry|tapestries]].

Morris was producing repeating patterns for wallpaper as early as 1862, and some six years later he designed his first pattern specifically for fabric printing. As in so many other areas that interested him, Morris chose to work with the ancient technique of [[woodblock printing on textiles|hand woodblock printing]] in preference to the [[roller printing on textiles|roller printing]] which had almost completely replaced it for commercial uses.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parry, pp. 36"&gt;Parry, ''William Morris Textiles'', pp. 36–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reorganization and expansion==
In August 1874, Morris determined to restructure the partnership, generating a dispute with Marshall, Rossetti, and Madox Brown over the return on their shares. The company was dissolved and reorganized under Morris's sole ownership as Morris &amp; Co. on 31 March 1875.&lt;ref name="Bus" /&gt;

During these years, Morris took up the practical art of dyeing as a necessary adjunct of his manufacturing business. He spent much of his time at the [[Staffordshire]] dye works of [[Thomas Wardle (industrialist)|Thomas Wardle]], mastering the processes of that art and making experiments in the revival of old or discovery of new methods. One result of these experiments was to reinstate [[indigo dye|indigo]] dyeing as a practical industry, and generally to renew the use of those vegetable dyes, like [[Rose madder|madder]], which had been driven almost out of use by the [[aniline dyes|anilines]].

Dyeing of wools, silks, and cottons was the necessary preliminary to what he had much at heart, the production of woven and printed fabrics of the highest excellence; and the period of incessant work at the dye-vat (1875–76) was followed by a period during which he was absorbed in the production of textiles (1877–78), and more especially in the revival of carpet-weaving as a fine art.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parry, pp. 36"/&gt;

[[File:L L Pocock Pond at Merton Abbey.jpg|thumb|''The Pond at Merton Abbey'' by [[Lexden Lewis Pocock]] is an idyllic representation of the works in the time of William Morris.]]
In June 1881, Morris relocated his dyeworks from Queen Square to an early eighteenth-century silk-throwing works at [[Merton Abbey Mills]], after determining that the water of the [[River Wandle]] was suitable for dyeing.  The complex, on {{convert|7|acre|m2}}, included several buildings and a dyeworks, and the various buildings were soon adapted for stained-glass, textile printing, and fabric- and carpet-weaving.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, ''William Morris'', p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, Morris had taught himself [[tapestry]] weaving in the medieval style and set up a tapestry workshop with his apprentice [[John Henry Dearle]] at Queen Square.&lt;ref name="Text1"&gt;Parry, Linda: ''William Morris Textiles'', New York, Viking Press, pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt;  Dearle executed Morris and Co.'s first figural tapestry from a design by [[Walter Crane]] in 1883.&lt;ref name="Tapestry"&gt;Waggoner, ''The Beauty of Life'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Dearle was soon responsible for the training of all tapestry apprentices in the expanded workshop at Merton Abbey, and partnered with Morris on designing details such as fabric patterns and floral backgrounds for tapestries based on figure drawings or ''cartoons'' by Burne-Jones (some of them repurposed from stained glass cartoons).&lt;ref name="Text1" /&gt; and animal figures by Philip Webb. Suites of tapestries were made as part of whole-house decorating schemes, and tapestries of Burne-Jones angels and scenes from the [[King Arthur|Arthurian legends]] were a staple of Morris &amp; Co. into the twentieth century.

==Important commissions==
Two significant secular commissions helped establish the firm's reputation in the late 1860s: a royal project at [[St. James's Palace]] and the "green dining room" at the South Kensington Museum (now the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|Victoria and Albert]]) of 1867. The green dining room (preserved as the Morris Room at the V&amp;A) featured stained glass windows and panel figures by Burne-Jones, panels with branches of fruit or flowers by Morris, and olive branches and a frieze by Philip Webb. The St. James's commission comprised decorative schemes for the Armoury and the Tapestry Room, and included panels of stylized floral patterns painted on ceilings, [[cornice]]s, [[Dado (architecture)|dado]]s, windows, and doors.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Parry, "Domestic Decoration." In Parry, ''William Morris'', pp. 139–140&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871 Morris &amp; Co. were responsible for the windows at [[All Saints Church, Wilden|All Saints]] church in the village of [[Wilden, Worcestershire|Wilden]] near to [[Stourport-on-Severn]]. They were designed by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] for [[Alfred Baldwin (politician)|Alfred Baldwin]], his wife's brother-in-law.

[[Standen]] near [[East Grinstead]], [[West Sussex]], was designed between 1892 and 1894 by Philip Webb for a prosperous [[London]] solicitor, James Beale, his wife Margaret, and their family. It is decorated with Morris carpets, fabrics and wallpapers.

Stanmore Hall was the last major decorating commission executed by Morris &amp; Co. before Morris's death in 1896. It was also the most extensive commission undertaken by the firm, and included a series of [[Holy Grail tapestries|tapestries based on the story of the Holy Grail]] for the dining room, to which Morris devoted his energies, the rest of the work being executed under the direction of Dearle.&lt;ref name="Dom"&gt;Linda Parry, "Domestic Decoration." In Parry, ''William Morris'', pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Morris &amp; Co. commissions include the ceiling within the dining room of [[Charleville Forest Castle]], Ireland, interiors of Bullers Wood House, now [[Bullers Wood School]] in [[Chislehurst]], [[Kent]], and stained glass windows at [[Adcote]].

==Last stages==
[[File:Morris and Company Textile Printing Merton Abbey.jpg|thumb|Textile printing at [[Merton Abbey Mills|Merton Abbey]] c. 1890, from a booklet commemorating the 50th anniversary of the firm, 1911]]

As Morris pursued other interests, notably [[socialism]] and the [[Kelmscott Press]], day-to-day work at the firm was delegated. Morris's daughter [[May Morris|May]] became the director of the embroidery department in 1885, when she was in her early twenties.  Dearle, who had begun designing repeating patterns for wallpapers and textiles in the late 1880s,&lt;ref name="Text2"&gt;Parry, Linda: ''William Morris Textiles'', pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; was head designer for the firm by 1890, handling interior design commissions and supervising the tapestry, weaving, and fabric-printing departments at [[Merton Abbey Mills|Merton Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Linda, ed.: ''William Morris'', Abrams, 1996, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Dearle's contributions to textile design were long overshadowed by Morris. Dearle exhibited his designs under the Morris name rather than his own in the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts Exhibition]]s and the major Morris retrospective of 1899,&lt;ref name="TAC"&gt;Parry, Linda: ''Textiles of the Arts &amp; Crafts Movement'', Thames and Hudson, revised edition 2005, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Linda: ''William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement: A Sourcebook'', New York, Portland House, 1989, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; and even today many Dearle designs are popularly offered as "William Morris" patterns.

On Morris's death in 1896, Dearle became Art Director of the firm, which changed its name again to Morris &amp; Co. Decorators Ltd. in 1905.&lt;ref name="Dom" /&gt; Dearle managed the company's textile works at Merton Abbey until his own death in 1932.&lt;ref name="TAC" /&gt; The firm was finally dissolved in the early months of [[World War II]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8117">In [[systems engineering]] and [[requirements engineering]], a '''non-functional requirement''' (NFR) is a [[requirement]] that specifies criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors. They are contrasted with [[functional requirement]]s that define specific behavior or functions. The plan for implementing ''functional'' requirements is detailed in the [[Systems design|system ''design'']].  The plan for implementing ''non-functional'' requirements is detailed in the [[Systems architecture|system ''architecture'']], because they are usually [[architecturally significant requirements]].&lt;ref name="ASR_Chen"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1109/MS.2012.174|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6365165|title = Characterizing Architecturally Significant Requirements|journal = IEEE Software|volume = 30|issue = 2|pages = 38–45|year = 2013|last1 = Chen|first1 = Lianping|last2 = Ali Babar|first2 = Muhammad|last3 = Nuseibeh|first3 = Bashar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly, functional requirements define what a system is supposed to ''do'' and non-functional requirements define how a system is supposed to ''be''.  Functional requirements are usually in the form of "system shall do &lt;requirement&gt;", an individual action or part of the system, perhaps explicitly in the sense of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]], a [[black box]] description input, output, process and control [[functional model]] or [[IPO Model]]. In contrast, non-functional requirements are in the form of "system shall be &lt;requirement&gt;", an overall property of the system as a whole or of a particular aspect and not a specific function. The system's overall properties commonly mark the difference between whether the development project has succeeded or failed.

Non-functional requirements are often called "[[List of system quality attributes|quality attributes]]" of a system. Other terms for non-functional requirements are "qualities", "quality goals", "quality of service requirements", "constraints", "non-behavioral requirements",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stellman | first=Andrew | last2=Greene | first2=Jennifer | title=Applied Software Project Management | url=http://www.stellman-greene.com/aspm/ | page=113 | publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]] | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-596-00948-9 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209011617/http://www.stellman-greene.com/aspm/ | archivedate=2015-02-09 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "technical requirements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ambler |first1=Scott |title=Technical (Non-Functional) Requirements: An Agile Introduction |url=http://agilemodeling.com/artifacts/technicalRequirement.htm |website=Agile Modelling |publisher=Ambysoft Inc. |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informally these are sometimes called the "[[wikt:ility|ilities]]", from attributes like stability and portability. Qualities—that is non-functional requirements—can be divided into two main categories:

# Execution qualities, such as safety, security and usability, which are observable during operation (at run time).
# Evolution qualities, such as [[software testability|testability]], maintainability, extensibility and scalability, which are embodied in the static structure of the system.&lt;ref name="Wiegers13"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiegers|first1=Karl|last2=Beatty|first2=Joy|title=Software Requirements, Third Edition|year=2013|publisher=Microsoft Press|isbn=978-0-7356-7966-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Young01"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Ralph R. |title=Effective Requirements Practices |year=2001 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=978-0-201-70912-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
A system may be required to present the user with a display of the number of records in a database. This is a functional requirement. How up-to-date [update] this number needs to be, is a non-functional requirement. If the number needs to be updated in real time, the system architects must ensure that the system is capable of updating the [displayed] record count within an acceptably short interval of the number of records changing.

Sufficient network bandwidth may be a non-functional requirement of a system. Other examples include:

The '''Nuclear Decommissioning Authority''' ('''NDA''') is a [[non-departmental public body]] of the [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]], formed by the [[Energy Act 2004]]. It evolved from the Coal and Nuclear Liabilities Unit of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]]. It came into existence during late 2004, and took on its main functions on 1 April 2005. Its purpose is to deliver the [[Nuclear decommissioning|decommissioning]] and clean-up of the [[Nuclear power in the United Kingdom|UK’s civil nuclear]] legacy in a safe and cost-effective manner, and where possible to accelerate programmes of work that reduce hazard. The NDA does not directly manage the UK's nuclear sites. It oversees the work through contracts with specially designed companies known as Site Licence Companies. The NDA determines the overall strategy and priorities for managing decommissioning.

Although the NDA itself only employs 300 staff, its annual budget is £3.2 billion. The vast majority of the NDA budget is spent through contracts with Site Licence Companies, who also sub contract to other companies which provide special services. The NDA aims to do this by introducing innovation and contractor expertise through a series of competitions similar to the model that has been used in the United States.

In April 2017, the NDA lost a legal case in the [[UK Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] regarding the [[Public procurement|procurement]] of a sizeable contract for the decommissioning of 12 different Magnox nuclear facilities when EnergySolutions EU Ltd. (now called ATK Energy EU Ltd.) challenged a decision in connection with ATK’s unsuccessful bid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2016-0006-press-summary.pdf Press Summary: Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (Appellant) v EnergySolutions EU Ltd (now called ATK Energy EU Ltd) (Respondent) [2017] UKSC 34 on appeal from: [2015] EWCA Civ 1262], 11 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018 the UK parliament's [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] (PAC) concluded that the NDA had "dramatically under-estimated" costs and "completely failed" in the procurement and management of the [[Magnox Ltd]] contract, which was one of the highest value contracts let by the government. An independent inquiry into the deal was set up.&lt;ref name=wnn-20180703&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/C-NDA-to-take-over-management-of-Magnox-sites-0307185.html |title=NDA to take over management of Magnox sites |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=3 July 2018 |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pac-20180227&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmpubacc/461/46102.htm |title=The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority's Magnox contract |publisher=UK Parliament |work=Public Accounts Committee |date=27 February 2018 |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

=== Objectives===
The main objectives of NDA are to:

*eliminate site hazards and develop waste solutions;
*ensure the highest standards in safety, security and environmental management;
*build an effective world class industry;
*gain full approval and support from stakeholders (employees, contractors, government, local communities and general public); and
*make best use of assets and maximise value-for-money.

===Structure===
[[File:Aerial view Sellafield, Cumbria - geograph.org.uk - 50827.jpg|thumb|[[Sellafield]], NDA's largest site]]
Responsibility for operating the sites has been restructured into five Site Licence Companies (SLCs). The management of the SLCs is contracted out to different Parent Body Organisations (PBOs), which are owned by private companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nda.gov.uk/news/slc-names.cfm NDA Confirms Names of New Site Licence Companies], Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (14 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Sellafield Ltd]]''' was previously [[BNFL]]'s '''British Nuclear Group''' subsidiary. It comprises [[Sellafield]] nuclear chemical facility, [[Calder Hall]] and [[Windscale]]. It also previously managed the [[Capenhurst]] [[uranium]] enrichment plant, which is now owned by [[Urenco Group|Urenco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/C-Urenco_takes_on_Capenhurst_site-3011125.html |title=Urenco takes on Capenhurst site |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=30 November 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its PBO was formerly Nuclear Management Partners Ltd, a consortium of [[URS Corporation|URS]], [[Amec Foster Wheeler]] and [[Areva]]. However, Sellafield Ltd has been under the direct control of the NDA since April 2016. 
*'''[[Magnox Ltd]]''' previously two separate Site Licence Companies)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magnoxsites.co.uk/news/2011-01-11/magnox-limited Magnox Limited] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402112105/http://www.magnoxsites.co.uk/news/2011-01-11/magnox-limited |date=2012-04-02 }}, manages ten [[Magnox]] nuclear power stations and the [[Harwell Laboratory|Harwell]] and [[Winfrith]] facilities. Magnox Sites (11 January 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises [[Chapelcross nuclear power station|Chapelcross]], [[Hunterston A nuclear power station|Hunterston A]], [[Trawsfynydd nuclear power station|Trawsfynydd]], [[Wylfa nuclear power station|Wylfa]] and [[Oldbury nuclear power station|Oldbury]] (previously '''Magnox North Ltd''') and [[Berkeley nuclear power station|Berkeley]], [[Bradwell nuclear power station|Bradwell]], [[Dungeness nuclear power station|Dungeness A]], [[Hinkley Point A nuclear power station|Hinkley Point A]] and [[Sizewell nuclear power stations|Sizewell A]] (previously '''Magnox South Ltd'''). Its PBO is Cavendish Fluor Partnership Ltd, a consortium of [[Babcock International]] and [[Fluor Corporation|Fluor]]. 
*'''Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd''' comprises the [[Dounreay]] site. Its PBO is Cavendish Dounreay Partnership Ltd, a consortium of [[Babcock International]], [[CH2M HILL]] and [[URS Corporation|URS]].
*'''LLW Repository Ltd''' comprises the [[Low Level Waste Repository]] near [[Drigg]] in Cumbria. Its PBO is UK Nuclear Waste Management Ltd, a consortium of [[URS Corporation|URS]], [[Studsvik]], [[Areva]] and [[Serco]].
*'''Springfields Fuels Ltd''' comprises the [[Springfields]] nuclear fuel production facility near Preston, Lancashire. Its PBO is [[Westinghouse Electric Company]], a subsidiary of [[Toshiba]].

On its creation, the NDA also took over ownership of [[Direct Rail Services]], the rail [[freight operating company]] set up by [[BNFL]] in 1995 to transport nuclear materials.

The NDA is also the owner of [[International Nuclear Services]], which operates services on behalf of the NDA for the management and transportation of nuclear fuels.

The NDA is also the owner of Radioactive Waste Management Ltd (RWM), which is responsible for implementing a geological disposal facility in the UK and provide radioactive waste management solutions.

In February 2017 a national archive for the UK civil nuclear industry, named Nucleus, was opened in [[Wick, Caithness]], Scotland.&lt;ref name=bbc-20170214&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-38855127 |title=National archive for nuclear industry opens in Wick |work=BBC News |date=14 February 2017 |accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the cost of decommissioning these sites was planned at £55.8 billion, with Sellafield requiring £31.5 billion.&lt;ref name=nda-strategy-2005&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.nda.gov.uk/documents/upload/Draft_Strategy_for_Consultation_2005.pdf |title=NDA Strategy - draft for consultation |page=66 |publisher=Nuclear Decommissioning Authority |year=2005 |accessdate=7 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122155158/http://www.nda.gov.uk/documents/upload/Draft_Strategy_for_Consultation_2005.pdf |archivedate=22 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2006 the NDA reported that the cost of cleaning up existing waste was higher than previously thought, and gave a new estimated decommissioning cost of about £72 billion over a 100-year period.&lt;ref name=bbc-20060330&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4859980.stm |title=Nuclear clean-up 'to cost £70bn' |publisher=BBC News |date=30 March 2006 |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 estimated decommissioning costs increased to £73.6 billion, or after taking account of [[discount window|discount rates]], £44.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nda.gov.uk/news/arac-0708.cfm |title=Annual Report &amp; Accounts 2007/08 |publisher=Nuclear Decommissioning Authority |date= |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 estimate foresaw £14bn of offsetting income from reprocessing fuel at [[Sellafield]].&lt;ref name=bbc-20060330 /&gt; In 2009 the NDA sold land near three existing reactor sites for expected new nuclear power stations, for over £200m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article5992467.ece |title=Prices soar as bidders fight for nuclear sites |publisher=The Sunday Times |date=29 March 2009 |author=Danny Fortson and Dominic O’Connell |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a critical [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] report stated that the private consortium managing Sellafield has failed to reduce costs and delays.

==National Nuclear Laboratory==
In 2006, the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced his support for a [[National Nuclear Laboratory]] (NNL) to be based on the British Technology Centre at Sellafield and Nexia Solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nda.gov.uk/stakeholders/newsletter/nnl-announced-sos.cfm Alistair Darling announces the formation of the National Nuclear Laboratory], Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (30/06/06).&lt;/ref&gt; The NDA, as the owner of Sellafield site and the funder of majority of research required across the nuclear estate, was involved establishing the NNL in 2009. The NNL complements other initiatives to develop a sustainable workforce such as the National Skills Academy for Nuclear (NSAN) network, including the development of Energus in West Cumbria, alongside complementary research and development facilities such as the [http://www.dalton.manchester.ac.uk/ Dalton Nuclear Institute].

'''Paleoenzymology''' (British: palaeoenzymology) is the study of prehistoric life through the properties of [[enzymes]] present in those organisms. Ancient enzymes can be [[Ancestral sequence reconstruction|reconstructed]] if their [[Protein sequence|sequences]] can be inferred from the sequences of current enzymes. Such inferrence is possible through [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] techniques such as [[Maximum Likelihood|maximum likelihood]] and [[Bayesian inference in phylogeny|Bayesian inference]].

== Examples ==
One example is the reconstruction of [[thioredoxin]] enzymes from up to 4 billion year old organisms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perez-Jimenez|first=Raul|author2=Alvaro Inglés-Prieto|author3=Zi-Ming Zhao|author4=Inmaculada Sanchez-Romero|author5=Jorge Alegre-Cebollada|author6=Pallav Kosuri|author7=Sergi Garcia-Manyes|author8=T Joseph Kappock|author9=Masaru Tanokura|date=3 April 2011|title=Single-molecule paleoenzymology probes the chemistry of resurrected enzymes|url=http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nsmb.2020.html|journal=Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology|volume=18|issue=5|pages=592–6|doi=10.1038/nsmb.2020|pmid=21460845|accessdate=3 April 2011|author10=Arne Holmgren|author11=Jose M Sanchez-Ruiz|author12=Eric A Gaucher|author13=Julio M Fernandez|pmc=3087858}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the chemical activity of these reconstructed enzymes were remarkably similar to modern enzymes, their physical properties showed significantly elevated thermal and acidic stability. These results were interpreted as suggesting that ancient life may have evolved in oceans that were much hotter and more acidic than today.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As a [[Branches of science|sub-discipline]] of [[biology]], the focus of physiology is in how [[organism]]s, [[organ system]]s, [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], [[cell (biology)|cells]], and [[biomolecule]]s carry out the [[Chemistry|chemical]] and [[Physics|physical]] functions that exist in a living system.&lt;ref name="Guyton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=John|title=Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology|year=2011|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-1-4160-4574-8|pages=3|edition=12th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to an understanding of physiological functioning is the investigation of the fundamental biophysical and biochemical phenomena, the coordinated [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] control mechanisms, and the continuous [[Cell signaling|communication]] between cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vander's Human Physiology The Mechanisms of Body Function|last=Widmaier|first=Eric P.|last2=Raff|first2=Hershel|last3=Strang|first3=Kevin T.|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2016|isbn=978-1-259-29409-9|location=New York, NY|pages=14–15|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''physiologic''' state is the condition occurring from normal body function, while the [[Pathology|pathological]] state is centered on the abnormalities that occur in animal diseases, including humans.&lt;ref name="medicalnewstoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248791.php|title=What is physiology?|work=Medical News Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the type of investigated organisms, the field can be divided into, animal physiology (including that of [[Homo sapiens|humans]]), [[plant physiology]], [[Cell physiology|cellular physiology]] and [[microbial metabolism|microbial physiology]].&lt;ref name="Guyton" /&gt;

The [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] is awarded to those who make significant achievements in this discipline by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

Human physiology seeks to understand the mechanisms that work to keep the [[human body]] alive and functioning,&lt;ref name="Guyton"/&gt; through scientific enquiry into the nature of mechanical, physical, and biochemical functions of humans, their organs, and the cells of which they are composed. The principal level of focus of physiology is at the level of organs and systems within systems. The endocrine and nervous systems play major roles in the reception and transmission of signals. that integrate function in animals. Homeostasis is a major aspect with regard to such interactions within plants as well as animals. The biological basis of the study of physiology, integration refers to the overlap of many functions of the systems of the human body, as well as its accompanied form. It is achieved through communication that occurs in a variety of ways, both electrical and chemical.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Changes in physiology can impact the mental functions of individuals. Examples of this would be the effects of certain medications or toxic levels of substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mental disorders|url=http://www.who.int/topics/mental_disorders/en/|website=World Health Organization|publisher=WHO|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Change in [[behavior change (individual)|behavior]] as a result of these substances is often used to assess the health of individuals.&lt;ref name = Davis2017&gt;{{cite web | title = Eszopiclone | publisher = F.A.

Much of the foundation of knowledge in human physiology was provided by animal experimentation. Due to the frequent connection between form and function, physiology and [[anatomy]] are intrinsically linked and are studied in tandem as part of a medical curriculum.&lt;ref name="NIH2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bergman |first1=Esther M |last2=de Bruin |first2=Anique BH |last3=Herrler |first3=Andreas |last4=Verheijen |first4=Inge WH |last5=Scherpbier |first5=Albert JJA |last6=van der Vleuten |first6=Cees PM |title=Students' perceptions of anatomy across the undergraduate problem-based learning medical curriculum: a phenomenographical study |pmc=4225514 |journal=BMC Medical Education |doi=10.1186/1472-6920-13-152 |date=19 November 2013 |quote=Together with physiology and biochemistry, anatomy is one of the basic sciences that are to be taught in the medical curriculum. |pmid=24252155 |volume=13 |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plants===
{{Main|Plant physiology}}Plant physiology is a subdiscipline of [[botany]] concerned with the functioning of plants. Closely related fields include [[plant morphology]], [[plant ecology]], [[phytochemistry]], [[cell biology]], genetics, [[biophysics]], and [[molecular biology]]. Fundamental processes of plant physiology include [[photosynthesis]], [[Respiration in plant|respiration]], [[plant nutrition]], [[tropism]]s, [[nastic movements]], [[photoperiodism]], [[photomorphogenesis]], [[circadian rhythm]]s, [[Germination|seed germination]], [[dormancy]], and [[stoma]]ta function and transpiration. Absorption of water by roots, production of food in the leaves, and growth of shoots towards light are examples of plant physiology.

===Cells===
{{Main|Cell physiology}}Although there are differences between animal, plant, and microbial cells, the basic physiological functions of cells can be divided into the processes of [[cell division]], [[cell signaling]], [[cell growth]], and [[Metabolism|cell metabolism]].

===Microorganisms===
{{Main|Microorganism}}Microorganisms can be found almost everywhere on Earth. Types of microorganisms include archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes, protists, fungi, and micro-plants. [[Microbes in human culture|Microbes are important in human culture]] and [[health]] in many ways, serving to [[Fermentation in food processing|ferment foods]], [[Sewage treatment|treat sewage]], [[Algae fuel|produce fuel]], [[enzyme]]s and other [[bioactive compound]]s. They are essential tools in [[biology]] as [[model organism]]s and have been put to use in [[biological warfare]] and [[bioterrorism]]. They are a vital [[Soil microbiology|component of fertile soils]]. In the [[human body]] microorganisms make up the [[human microbiota]] including the essential [[gut flora]]. They are the [[pathogen]]s responsible for many [[infectious disease]]s and as such are the target of [[Hygiene|hygiene measures]]. Most microorganisms can reproduce rapidly, and bacteria are also able to freely exchange genes through [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]], [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] and [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]], even between widely divergent species.

== History ==

===The classical era===
The study of human physiology as a medical field originates in [[classical Greece]], at the time of [[Hippocrates]] (late 5th century BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scienceclarified.com/Ph-Py/Physiology.html |title=Physiology|work=Science Clarified |publisher= Advameg, Inc. |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Outside of Western tradition, early forms of physiology or anatomy can be reconstructed as having been present at around the same time in China,&lt;ref&gt;Helaine Selin, ''Medicine Across Cultures: History and Practice of Medicine in Non-Western Cultures'' (2003), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; India&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Physiology and Chemistry to Biochemistry|page=8|publisher=Pearson Education|author1=D. P. Burma |author2=Maharani Chakravorty }}&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere.
Hippocrates incorporated his belief system called the theory of humours, which consisted of four basic substance: earth, water, air and fire. Each substance is known for having a corresponding humour: black bile, phlegm, blood and yellow bile, respectively. Hippocrates also noted some emotional connections to the four humours, which Claudius Galenus would later expand on. The critical thinking of [[Aristotle]] and his emphasis on the relationship between structure and function marked the beginning of physiology in [[Ancient Greece]]. Like Hippocrates, Aristotle took to the humoral theory of disease, which also consisted of four primary qualities in life: hot, cold, wet and dry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/neurophysio.html|title=Early Medicine and Physiology|work=ship.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius Galenus (c. ~130–200&amp;nbsp;AD), known as [[Galen]] of Pergamum, was the first to use experiments to probe the functions of the body. Unlike Hippocrates, Galen argued that humoral imbalances can be located in specific organs, including the entire body.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/223895/Galen-of-Pergamum|title=Galen of Pergamum|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; His modification of this theory better equipped doctors to make more precise diagnoses. Galen also played off of Hippocrates idea that emotions were also tied to the humours, and added the notion of temperaments: sanguine corresponds with blood; phlegmatic is tied to phlegm; yellow bile is connected to choleric; and black bile corresponds with melancholy. Galen also saw the human body consisting of three connected systems: the brain and nerves, which are responsible for thoughts and sensations; the heart and arteries, which give life; and the liver and veins, which can be attributed to nutrition and growth.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; Galen was also the founder of experimental physiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = C. | last1 = Fell | first2 = F. | last2 = Pearson | title = Historical Perspectives of Thoracic Anatomy | journal = Thoracic Surgery Clinics |date=November 2007 | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 443–8| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1547412706001034 | doi = 10.1016/j.thorsurg.2006.12.001| pmid = 18271159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And for the next 1,400 years, Galenic physiology was a powerful and influential tool in medicine.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

===Early modern period===
[[Jean Fernel]] (1497–1558), a French physician, introduced the term "physiology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Scientific Revolution: From Copernicus to Newton |page=344|author=Wilbur Applebaum|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galen, [[Ibn al-Nafis]], [[Michael Servetus]], [[Realdo Colombo]], [[Amato Lusitano]] and [[William Harvey]], are credited as making important discoveries in the [[circulation of the blood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rampling|first=M. W.|date=2016|title=The history of the theory of the circulation of the blood|journal=Clinical Hemorheology and Microcirculation|volume=64|issue=4|pages=541–549|doi=10.3233/CH-168031|issn=1875-8622|pmid=27791994}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Santorio Santorio]] in 1610s was the first to use a device to measure the [[pulse]] rate (the ''pulsilogium''), and a [[thermoscope]] to measure temperature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/treasures/santorio-santorio-1561-1636/|title=Santorio Santorio (1561-1636): Medicina statica|last=|first=|date=|website=Vaulted Treasures|publisher=University of Virginia, Claude Moore Health Sciences Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1791 [[Luigi Galvani]] described the role of electricity in nerves of dissected frogs. In 1811, Julien Jean César Legallois studied respiration in animal dissection and lesions and found the center of respiration in the [[medulla oblongata]]. In the same year, [[Charles Bell]] finished work on what would later become known as the [[Bell-Magendie law]], which compared functional differences between dorsal and ventral roots of the [[spinal cord]]. In 1824, [[François Magendie]] described the sensory roots and produced the first evidence of the cerebellum’s role in [[Equilibrioception|equilibration]] to complete the Bell-Magendie law.

In the 1820s, the French physiologist [[Henri Milne-Edwards]] introduced the notion of physiological division of labor, which allowed to "compare and study living things as if they were machines created by the industry of man." Inspired in the work of [[Adam Smith]], Milne-Edwards wrote that the "body of all living beings, whether animal or plant, resembles a factory ... where the organs, comparable to workers, work incessantly to produce the phenomena that constitute the life of the individual." In more differentiated organisms, the functional labor could be apportioned between different instruments or [[Biological system|systems]] (called by him as ''appareils'').&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;R. M. Brain. ''The Pulse of Modernism: Physiological Aesthetics in Fin-de-Siècle Europe''. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2015. 384 pp., [https://books.google.com/books?id=l8IECgAAQBAJ].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1858, [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] studied the cause of blood coagulation and inflammation that resulted after previous injuries and surgical wounds. He later discovered and implemented [[antiseptic]]s in the operating room, and as a result decreased death rate from surgery by a substantial amount.&lt;ref name="medicalnewstoday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="physiologyinfo.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physiologyinfo.org/mm/Timeline-of-Physiology/Milestones-in-Physiology.pdf|date=1 October 2013|title= Milestones in Physiology (1822-2013)|accessdate=2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Physiological Society]] was founded in London in 1876 as a dining club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physoc.org/society-history|title=The Society's history {{!}} Physiological Society|website=www.physoc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The American Physiological Society]]  (APS) is a nonprofit organization that was founded in 1887. The Society is, "devoted to fostering education, scientific research, and dissemination of information in the physiological sciences."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-aps.org/fm/About-Us.html|title=American Physiological Society &gt; About|website=www.the-aps.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, [[Ivan Pavlov]] performed research on "conditional responses" that involved dogs' saliva production in response to a bell and visual stimuli.&lt;ref name="physiologyinfo.org"/&gt;

In the 19th century, physiological knowledge began to accumulate at a rapid rate, in particular with the 1838 appearance of the [[Cell theory]] of [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Matthias Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]]. It radically stated that organisms are made up of units called cells. [[Claude Bernard]]'s (1813–1878) further discoveries ultimately led to his concept of ''[[milieu interieur]]'' (internal environment),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to the Study of Ex- perimental Medicine|last=Bernard|first=Claude|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1865|isbn=|location=New York|publication-date=1957|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lectures on the Phenomena of Life Common to Animals and Plants|last=Bernard|first=Claude|publisher=Thomas|year=1878|isbn=|location=Springfield|publication-date=1974|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would later be taken up and championed as "[[homeostasis]]" by American physiologist [[Walter B. Cannon]] in 1929. By homeostasis, Cannon meant "the maintenance of steady states in the body and the physiological processes through which they are regulated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brown Theodore M. |author2=Fee Elizabeth | date = October 2002 | title = Walter Bradford Cannon: Pioneer Physiologist of Human Emotions | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 92 | issue = 10| pages = 1594–1595 | pmc=1447286 | doi=10.2105/ajph.92.10.1594}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the body's ability to regulate its internal environment. William Beaumont was the first American to utilize the practical application of physiology.

Nineteenth century physiologists such as [[Michael Foster (physiologist)|Michael Foster]], [[Max Verworn]], and [[Alfred Binet]], based on [[Haeckel]]'s ideas, elaborated what came to be called "general physiology", a unified science of life based on the cell actions,&lt;ref name=brain/&gt; later renamed in the 20th century as [[cell biology]].&lt;ref&gt;Heilbron, J. L. (2003). ''The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science'', Oxford University Press, p. 649, [https://books.google.com/books?id=abqjP-_KfzkC link].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late modern period===
In the 20th century, biologists  became interested in how organisms other than human beings function, eventually spawning the fields of [[comparative physiology]] and [[ecophysiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Feder | first1=ME |last2=Bennett |first2=AF |first3=Burggren |last3=WW |last4=Huey |first4=RB  | title = New directions in ecological physiology | year = 1987 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-521-34938-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major figures in these fields include [[Knut Schmidt-Nielsen]] and [[George Bartholomew (biologist)|George Bartholomew]]. Most recently, [[evolutionary physiology]] has become a distinct subdiscipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = Theodore | last1 = Garland, Jr | author1-link=Theodore Garland, Jr. | last2 = Carter | first2 = P.

In 1920, [[August Krogh]] won the Nobel Prize for discovering how, in capillaries, blood flow is regulated.&lt;ref name="physiologyinfo.org"/&gt;

In 1954, [[Andrew Huxley]] and Hugh Huxley, alongside their research team, discovered the sliding filaments in [[skeletal muscle]], known today as the sliding filament theory.&lt;ref name="physiologyinfo.org"/&gt;

Recently, there have been intense debates about the vitality of physiology as a discipline (Is it dead or alive?).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinter|first=G. G.|last2=Pinter|first2=V.|date=1993|title=Is Physiology a Dying Discipline?|journal=Physiology|volume=8|issue=2|pages=94–95|doi=10.1152/physiologyonline.1993.8.2.94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lemoine|first=Maël|last2=Pradeu|first2=Thomas|date=2018-07-01|title=Dissecting the Meanings of "Physiology" to Assess the Vitality of the Discipline|journal=Physiology (Bethesda, Md.)|volume=33|issue=4|pages=236–245|doi=10.1152/physiol.00015.2018|issn=1548-9221|pmid=29873600}}&lt;/ref&gt; If physiology is perhaps less visible nowadays than during the golden age of the 19th century,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of the Modern Biological and Earth Science|last=Kremer|first=Richard L.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=9781139056007|editor-last=Bowler &amp; Pickstone|location=Cambridge|pages=342–366|chapter=Physiology|doi=10.1017/CHOL9780521572019.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is in large part because the field has given birth to some of the most active domains of today's biological sciences, such as [[neuroscience]], [[endocrinology]], and [[immunology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noble|first=Denis|date=2013|title=More on Physiology Without Borders|journal=Physiology|volume=28|issue=1|pages=2–3|doi=10.1152/physiol.00044.2012|issn=1548-9213|pmid=23280350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, physiology is still often seen as an integrative discipline, which can put together into a coherent framework data coming from various different domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neill|first=Jimmy D.|last2=Benos|first2=Dale J.|date=1993|title=Relationship of Molecular Biology to Integrative Physiology|journal=Physiology|volume=8|issue=5|pages=233–235|doi=10.1152/physiologyonline.1993.8.5.233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noble|first=Denis|date=2002-03-01|title=Modeling the Heart--from Genes to Cells to the Whole Organ|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/295/5560/1678|journal=Science|language=en|volume=295|issue=5560|pages=1678–1682|doi=10.1126/science.1069881|issn=0036-8075|pmid=11872832}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Notable physiologists==
{{Main|List of physiologists}}

=== Women in physiology ===
Initially, women were largely excluded from official involvement in any physiological society. The [[American Physiological Society]], for example, was founded in 1887 and included only men in its ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Physiological Society &gt; Founders|url=http://www.the-aps.org/fm/founders.html|website=www.the-aps.org|publisher=The American Physiological Society|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, the American Physiological Society elected [[Ida Hyde]] as the first female member of the society.&lt;ref name="Tucker 1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1=GS|title=Ida Henrietta Hyde: the first woman member of the society|journal=The Physiologist|date=December 1981|volume=24|issue=6|pages=1–9|pmid=7043502|url=http://www.the-aps.org/mm/Publications/Journals/Physiologist/1980-1989/1981/December.pdf}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyde, a representative of the [[American Association of University Women]] and a global advocate for gender equality in education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/hydeida-henrietta|title=Ida Henrietta Hyde|work=jwa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempted to promote gender equality in every aspect of science and medicine.

Soon thereafter, in 1913, [[J.S. Haldane]] proposed that women be allowed to formally join [[The Physiological Society]], which had been founded in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physoc.org/women-physiology|title=Women in Physiology {{!}} Physiological Society|website=www.physoc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 July 1915, six women were officially admitted: [[Florence Buchanan]], [[Winifred Cullis]], [[Ruth C. Skelton]], [[Sarah C. M. Sowton]], [[Constance Leetham Terry]], and  [[Enid M. Tribe]].&lt;ref name="physoc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physoc.org/women-physiology|title=Women in Physiology|work=physoc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The centenary of the election of women was celebrated in 2015 with the publication of the book "Women Physiologists: Centenary Celebrations And Beyond For The Physiological Society." ({{ISBN|978-0-9933410-0-7}})

Prominent women physiologists include:

'''Popular culture''' (also called '''pop culture''') is generally recognized by members of a society as a set of the  [[cultural practice|practices]],  [[opinion|beliefs]] and  [[cultural objects|objects]] that are dominant or ubiquitous in a [[society]] at a given point in time. Popular culture also encompasses the activities and feelings produced as a result of interaction with these dominant objects. Heavily influenced in [[modern history|modern times]] by [[mass media]], this collection of ideas permeates the [[everyday life|everyday lives]] of people in a given society. Therefore, popular culture has a way of influencing an individual's  [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] towards certain topics.&lt;ref&gt;McGaha, Julie. "Popular Culture &amp; Globalization". ''Multicultural Education'' 23.1 (2015): 32–37. ''SocINDEX with Full Text''. Web. 5 Aug. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are various ways to define pop culture.&lt;ref&gt;Strinati, D. (2004). ''An introduction to theories of popular culture''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, popular culture is considered{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} an empty conceptual category, or something that can be defined in a variety of conflicting ways by different people across different contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, J. (2018). ''Cultural theory and popular culture: An introduction''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally defined{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} in contrast to other forms of [[culture]] such as [[folk culture]], [[working-class culture]], or [[high culture]], and also through different theoretical perspectives such as [[psychoanalysis]], [[structuralism]],  [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodernism]], and more. The most common pop-culture categories are: [[entertainment]] (such as [[movies]], [[music]], [[television]] and [[video games]]), [[sport]]s, [[news]] (as in people/places in the news), [[politics]], [[fashion]]/clothes, [[technology]], and [[slang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://mrpopculture.com/what-is-pop-culture |title= What Is Pop Culture? By Gary West}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular culture is sometimes viewed by many people as being trivial and [[Dumbing down|"dumbed down"]] in order to find consensual acceptance from (or to attract attention amongst) the [[mainstream]]. As a result, it comes under heavy criticism from various  [[Subculture|non-mainstream]] sources (most notably from [[Religion|religious]] groups and from [[Counterculture|countercultural]] groups) which deem it superficial, [[Consumerism|consumerist]],  [[Sensationalism|sensationalist]], or corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Darrell L.

==History and definitions==
{{see also|Cultural history}}
The term "popular culture" was coined in the 19th century or earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Although the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' lists the first use as 1854, it appears in an address by [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] in 1818: {{cite book|title=The Address of Pestalozzi to the British Public|year=1818|url=https://books.google.com/?id=i6BDAAAAcAAJ&amp;lpg=PT10&amp;pg=PT10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=I see that it is impossible to attain this end without founding the means of popular culture and instruction upon a basis which cannot be got at otherwise than in a profound examination of Man himself; without such an investigation and such a basis all is darkness.|author1=Pestalozzi|first1=Johann Heinrich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, popular culture was associated with poor [[education]] and the [[lower classes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ill|Per Adam Siljeström|sv}}, ''The educational institutions of the United States, their character and organization'', J. Chapman, 1853, p. 243: "Influence of European emigration on the state of civilization in the United States: Statistics of popular culture in America". [[John Morley]] presented an address ''On Popular Culture'' at the [[Birmingham Town Hall]] in 1876, dealing with the education of the lower classes.&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the "official culture" and higher education of the upper classes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DOoe_MqMQe4C&amp;pg=PA13 ''Rabelais and Bakhtin: Popular Culture in "Gargantua and Pantagruel"''] p.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=d6jtq0LglIAC&amp;pg=PA9 ''Rabelais's Radical Farce''] p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Victorian era]] Britain experienced social changes that resulted in increased [[literacy]] rates, and with the rise of capitalism and [[industrialisation]], people began to spend more money on entertainment. Labelling [[penny dreadful]]s the Victorian equivalent of video games, ''The Guardian'' described penny fiction as “Britain’s first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Penny dreadfuls: the Victorian equivalent of video games |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/30/penny-dreadfuls-victorian-equivalent-video-games-kate-summerscale-wicked-boy |accessdate=23 November 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing consumer culture and an increased capacity for travel via the invention of [[railway]] (the first public railway, [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]], opened in north-east England in 1825) created both a market for cheap popular literature, and the ability for it to be circulated on a large scale. The first penny serials were published in the 1830s to meet this demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=E. S. |authorlink=E. S. Turner |year=1975 |title=Boys Will be Boys |location=Harmondsworth |publisher=Penguin |isbn=0-14-004116-8 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stress in the distinction from "official culture" became more pronounced towards the end of the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;"Learning is dishonored when she stoops to attract," cited in a section "Popular Culture and True Education" in University extension, Issue 4, The American society for the extension of university teaching, 1894.&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=August 2012}} a usage that became established by the [[interbellum]] period.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. "the making of popular culture plays [in post-revolutionary Russian theater]", Huntly Carter, ''The new spirit in the Russian theatre, 1917–28: And a sketch of the Russian kinema and radio, 1919–28, showing the new communal relationship between the three'', Ayer Publishing, 1929, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=August 2012}}

From the end of [[World War II]], following major cultural and social changes brought by [[mass media]] innovations, the meaning of popular culture began to overlap with those of [[mass culture]], [[media culture]], image culture, [[consumer culture]], and culture for [[mass consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;"one look at the sheer mass and volume of what we euphemistically call our popular culture suffices", from [[Winthrop Sargeant]], 'In Defense of the High-Brow', an article from ''[[LIFE]]'' magazine, 11 April 1949, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Social and cultural changes in the United States were a pioneer in this with respect to other western countries.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The abbreviated form "pop" for popular, as in [[pop music]], dates from the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="NewGrovev15p85"&gt;''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', volume 15, p. 85 entry ''Pop music''&lt;/ref&gt; Although terms "pop" and "popular" are in some cases used interchangeably, and their meaning partially overlap, the term "pop" is narrower. Pop is specific of something containing qualities of mass appeal, while "popular" refers to what has gained popularity, regardless of its style.&lt;ref name="Steinem1965p73"&gt;[[Steinem, Gloria]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XFMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA73 ''Outs of pop culture''], in ''LIFE'' magazine, 20 August 1965, p. 73 quotation: {{quotation|Pop Culture-although big, mercurial, and slippery to define-is really an umbrella term that covers anything currently in fashion, all or most of whose ingredients are familiar to the public-at-large. The new dances are a perfect example... Pop Art itself may mean little to the average man, but its vocabulary...is always familiar.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="top40.about.com"&gt;Bill Lamb, [http://top40.about.com/od/popmusic101/a/popmusic.htm "What Is Pop Music? A Definition"], ''[[About.com]]'', retrieved 8 March 2012 quotation: {{quotation|It is tempting to confuse [[pop music]] with [[popular music]]. The ''[[New Grove Dictionary Of Music and Musicians]]'', the [[musicologist]]'s ultimate reference resource, identifies popular music as the music since industrialization in the 1800s that is most in line with the tastes and interests of the urban middle class. This would include an extremely wide range of music from vaudeville and minstrel shows to [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Pop music, on the other hand, has primarily come into usage to describe music that evolved out of the [[rock 'n roll]] revolution of the mid-1950s and continues in a definable path to today.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to author John Storey, there are six definitions of popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;John Storey. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SRN59zg9t9AC ''Cultural Theory and Popular Culture''], pp. 4–8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[quantitative property|quantitative]] definition of culture has the problem that much "[[high culture]]" (e.g., [[television]] dramatizations of [[Jane Austen]]) is also "popular." "Pop culture" is also defined as the culture that is "left over" when we have decided what high culture is. However, many works straddle the boundaries, e.g., [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Charles Dickens]].

A third definition equates pop culture with "[[mass culture]]" and ideas. This is seen as a commercial culture, [[mass production|mass-produced]] for mass consumption by [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;Sérgio Campos Gonçalves, “[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216881597_Cultura_e_Sociedade_de_Consumo_um_olhar_em_retrospecto/file/6f288d60667a164854d4258d97a2a8b9.pdf?ev=pub_int_doc_dl Cultura e Sociedade de Consumo: um olhar em retrospecto]”, InRevista – Núcleo de Produção Científica em Comunicação – UNAERP (Ribeirão Preto), v. 3, pp. 18–28, 2008, {{ISSN|1980-6418}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From a Western European perspective, this may be compared to American culture.{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} Alternatively, "pop culture" can be defined as an "authentic" culture of the people, but this can be problematic as there are many ways of defining the "people."{{page needed|date=August 2012}} Storey argued that there is a political dimension to popular culture; [[Neo-Gramscianism#Hegemony|neo-Gramscian hegemony]] theory "... sees popular culture as a site of struggle between the 'resistance' of subordinate groups in society and the forces of 'incorporation' operating in the interests of dominant groups in society." A [[postmodern]]ist approach to popular culture would "no longer recognize the distinction between high and popular culture."

Storey claims that popular culture emerged from the [[urbanization]] of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Studies of [[Shakespeare]] (by Weimann, Barber, or Bristol, for example) locate much of the characteristic vitality of his drama in its participation in [[Renaissance]] popular culture, while contemporary practitioners like [[Dario Fo]] and [[John McGrath (playwright)|John McGrath]] use popular culture in its [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramscian]] sense that includes ancient folk traditions (the [[commedia dell'arte]] for example).&lt;ref&gt;{{ill|Robert Weimann|de}}, ''Shakespeare and the Popular Tradition'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Shaughnessy, ''The Cambridge companion to Shakespeare and popular culture'' (2007) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=August 2012}}

Popular culture is constantly evolving and occurs uniquely in place and [[time]]. It forms currents and eddies, and represents a complex of mutually interdependent perspectives and values that influence society and its institutions in various ways. For example, certain currents of pop culture may originate from, (or diverge into) a [[subculture]], representing perspectives with which the [[mainstream]] popular culture has only limited familiarity. Items of popular culture most typically appeal to a broad spectrum of the public. Important contemporary contributions for understanding what popular culture means have been given by the [[Germany|German]] researcher [[Ronald Daus]], who studies the impact of extra-European cultures in [[North America]], [[Asia]], and especially in [[Latin America]].

===Folklore===
Adaptations based on traditional [[folklore]] provide a source of popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;On the Ambiguity of the Three Wise Monkeys A. W. Smith ''[[Folklore (journal)|Folklore]]'', Vol. 104, No. 1/2 (1993), pp. 144–150&lt;/ref&gt; This early layer of cultural mainstream still persists today, in a form separate from mass-produced popular culture, propagating by word of mouth rather than via mass media, e.g. in the form of [[joke]]s or [[urban legend]]. With the widespread use of the [[Internet]] from the 1990s, the distinction between mass media and [[word-of-mouth]] has become blurred.

Although the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the [[commerce|commercial]] element, the public has its own tastes and it may not always embrace every cultural or subcultural item sold. Moreover, beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture spread by [[word of mouth|word-of-mouth]], and become modified in the process and in the same manner that folklore evolves.

== Usage ==
Many people say that popular culture is a tool that higher ranking people in a society and elites (who often control mass media and popular culture outlets) use to control the people below them in society. It's also said that popular culture dulls the minds of the "common man", making them more passive and easier to control, although popular culture can also be used as a means of rebellion against the ways and culture of dominant subcultures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/popular-culture-definition-3026453|title=How Did Pop Culture Originate?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be topical (as in the case of a [[local programming|local]] [[newscast]] and some [[made-for-television]] movies), or historical (as in the case of many documentaries and fictional series). They can be primarily [[instructional television|instructional]] or [[educational television|educational]], or entertaining as is the case in [[situation comedy]] and [[game shows]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Music===
{{Main|Popular music}}
'''Popular music''' is music with wide appeal&lt;ref name="PopMusic1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of "popular music" {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|url = http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/popular-music|website = www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate = 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is typically distributed to large audiences through the [[music industry]].

Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of [[written music]], although since the beginning of the [[recording industry]], it is also disseminated through [[sound recording|recordings]]. Traditional music forms such as early [[blues]] songs or [[hymn]]s were passed along orally, or to smaller, local audiences.&lt;ref name="PopMusic2" /&gt;

The '''Sea Around Us''' is an international research initiative and a member of the Global Fisheries Cluster at the [[University of British Columbia]]. The Sea Around Us assesses the impact of fisheries on the marine ecosystems of the world and offers mitigating solutions to a range of stakeholders. To achieve this, the Sea Around Us presents fisheries and fisheries-related data at spatial scales that have ecological and policy relevance, such as by Exclusive Economic Zones, High Seas areas, or Large Marine Ecosystems.

All spatialized data are visualized either graphically or mapped, and all data can be downloaded. Global fisheries catches from 1950 to the present are available, under explicit consideration of coral reefs, seamounts, estuaries and other critical habitats of fish and marine invertebrates. The data presented, which are all freely available, are meant to support studies of global fisheries trends and the development of sustainable, ecosystem-based fisheries policies.

In the early 2000s, members of the Sea Around Us uncovered that [[China]] was overestimating its catches and showed that, when such distortions were removed from overall fisheries catches, global fisheries were actually declining since the late 1980s.  The Sea Around Us also showed that the biomass of large fish in the [[North Atlantic]] is one-tenth of what it was only a century ago. [[Aquaculture]], according to another study with members from the Project, cannot be expected to compensate for overfishing but is instead likely to exacerbate the problem due to the reliance on wild fish for fishmeal. In other words, without serious long-term planning, the oceans might get a lot worse before they get better.

In 2016, members of the Sea Around Us, using reconstructed global catch data that combine officially reported landings data with comprehensive estimates of unreported landings and discards, documented that, from 1950-2010, global catches were around 50% higher than reported data suggest. Furthermore, total catches seem to be declining faster from their peak catch in the mid-1990s than reported data would suggest.

The good news is that the discrepancy between reported data and estimated total catches is decreasing in more recent years, meaning that the comprehensiveness of data reported by countries seems to be improving.

All this information was compiled in the [http://www.seaaroundus.org/sea-around-us-new-atlas-reveals-why-the-ocean-is-giving-us-1-2-million-mt-less-of-fish-every-year/ Global Atlas of Marine Fisheries], a 520-page book published in October 2016 by [https://islandpress.org/book/global-atlas-of-marine-fisheries Island Press].

The Sea Around Us also communicates to broad audiences to convey the urgency to:

* Reduce excess fishing capacity (much of which is being ‘exported’ to developing countries).
* Eliminate damaging subsidies and create extensive networks of marine protected areas.
* Reconsider the current model of carnivorous aquaculture.
* Refocus fisheries to the small-scale sectors that are crucial to national food security concerns in developing countries.

The Sea Around Us was initiated in collaboration with [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]] in 1999, and in 2014, Sea Around Us began a collaboration with [[Paul G. Allen Family Foundation|The Paul G. Allen Family Foundation]] and its executive arm, Vulcan Inc., to provide African and Asian countries with more accurate and comprehensive fisheries data, and to redesign and revamp the Sea Around Us website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="985">'''Site-based conservation''' is an approach to [[nature conservation]] that relies on the designation of important or representative examples of sites supporting key habitats or species, such as [[Key Biodiversity Areas]] (KBAs) or [[Important Bird Area]]s (IBAs). Whilst a rational way of ensuring that the very best resources are protected, it is open to a number of criticisms:
* It tends to focus resources and protection on only the best sites.
* With a changing climate, the best sites now may not be the best ones to protect for the future.
* Wildlife is ignorant of lines drawn on maps by humans.
On balance, site-based conservation is an essential part of nature conservation, along with initiatives such as environmental subsidies and planning controls that protect biodiversity across the whole landscape (the broad and shallow approach), and the more holistic ideas of [[landscape-scale conservation]].

'''''Six-Legged Soldiers: Using Insects as Weapons of War''''' is a [[nonfiction]] scientific warfare book written by award-winning author and [[University of Wyoming]] professor, [[Jeffrey A. Lockwood]]. Published in 2008 by [[Oxford University Press]], the book explores the history of [[bioterrorism]], [[entomological warfare]], [[biological warfare]], and the prevention of [[agro-terrorism]] from the earliest times to modern threats.&lt;ref name="timesonline" /&gt; Lockwood, an entomologist, preceded this book with ''Ethical issues in biological control'' (1997) and ''Locust: The devastating rise and mysterious disappearance of the insect that shaped the American frontier'' (2004), among others.

==Summary==
''Six-Legged Soldiers'' gives detailed examples of entomological warfare:  using buckets of scorpions during a fortress siege, [[catapult]]ing [[beehive]]s ("bee bombs") across a castle wall, civilians as human [[human subject research|guinea pigs]] in an effort to weaponize the [[Bubonic Plague|plague]], bombarding civilians from the air with infection-bearing insects, and [[Triatominae|assassin bugs]] placed on prisoners to eat away their flesh.&lt;ref name="timesonline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Publishers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6587574.html |title=Nonfiction Reviews |date=August 18, 2008 |work=Six-Legged Soldiers: Using Insects as Weapons of War Jeffrey A.

Interviewed about the book by [[BBC Radio 4]]'s [[Today programme]], the author describes how a [[terrorist]] with a suitcase could bring diseases into a country.  "I think a small terrorist cell could very easily develop an insect-based weapon."&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/wildlife/4123782/Terrorists-could-use-insect-based-biological-weapon.html|title=Terrorists could use 'insect-based' biological weapon |last=Adams |first=Stephen |date=5 Jan 2009|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In its January 2009 review, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' criticised the book as being "scarcely scholarly" for its mixed collection of myth, legend and historical facts.&lt;ref name="timesonline"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article5424088.ece|title=Six-legged Soldiers: Using Insects as Weapons of War by Jeffrey A Lockwood |last=Hastings |first=Max |date=January 4, 2009|publisher=timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Snowball Earth''' [[hypothesis]] proposes that [[Earth#Surface|Earth's surface]] became entirely or nearly entirely frozen at least once, sometime earlier than 650 [[Mya (unit)|Mya]] (million years ago). Proponents of the hypothesis argue that it best explains [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] deposits generally regarded as of [[glacial]] origin at [[tropics|tropical]] [[Paleomagnetism#Applications|palaeolatitudes]] and other enigmatic features in the [[geology|geological]] record. Opponents of the hypothesis contest the implications of the geological evidence for global glaciation and the [[geophysical]] feasibility of an [[ice]]- or [[slush]]-covered ocean&lt;ref name=Kirschvink1992&gt;{{cite book

The snowball-Earth episodes are proposed to have occurred before the sudden radiation of multicellular bioforms, known as the [[Cambrian explosion]]. The most recent snowball episode may have triggered the evolution of multicellularity. Another, much earlier and longer snowball episode, the [[Huronian glaciation]], which would have occurred 2400 to 2100&amp;nbsp;Mya, may have been triggered by the first appearance of oxygen in the atmosphere, the "[[Great Oxygenation Event]]".

{{Life timeline}}

===Evidence for ancient glaciation mounts===
Long before the idea of a global glaciation was established, a series of discoveries began to accumulate evidence for ancient Precambrian glaciations. The first of these discoveries was published in 1871 by J. Thomson who found ancient glacier-reworked material ([[tillite]]) in [[Islay]], Scotland. Similar findings followed in Australia (1884) and India (1887). A fourth and very illustrative finding that came to be known as "[[Reusch's Moraine]]" was reported by [[Hans Reusch]] in northern Norway in 1891. Many other findings followed, but their understanding was hampered by the rejection of [[continental drift]].&lt;ref name=Hoffman2011&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hoffman |first1=Paul F.|author-link=Paul F.

===Global glaciation proposed===
Sir [[Douglas Mawson]] (1882–1958), an Australian geologist and Antarctic explorer, spent much of his career studying the [[Neoproterozoic]] [[stratigraphy]] of South Australia, where he identified thick and extensive glacial sediments and late in his career speculated about the possibility of global glaciation.&lt;ref name="Mawson"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alderman | first1 = A.

Mawson's ideas of global glaciation, however, were based on the mistaken assumption that the geographic position of Australia, and that of other continents where low-latitude glacial deposits are found, has remained constant through time. With the advancement of the [[continental drift]] hypothesis, and eventually [[plate tectonic]] theory, came an easier explanation for the glaciogenic sediments—they were deposited at a point in time when the continents were at higher latitudes.

In 1964, the idea of global-scale glaciation reemerged when [[W. Brian Harland]] published a paper in which he presented [[palaeomagnetic]] data showing that glacial [[till]]ites in [[Svalbard]] and [[Greenland]] were deposited at tropical latitudes.&lt;ref name="Harland"&gt;{{cite journal

| doi=10.1007/BF01821169}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this palaeomagnetic data, and the sedimentological evidence that the glacial sediments interrupt successions of rocks commonly associated with tropical to temperate latitudes, he argued for an [[ice age]] that was so extreme that it resulted in the deposition of marine glacial rocks in the tropics.

In the 1960s, [[Mikhail Budyko]], a Russian climatologist, developed a simple energy-balance climate model to investigate the effect of ice cover on global [[climate]]. Using this model, Budyko found that if ice sheets advanced far enough out of the polar regions, a feedback loop ensued where the increased reflectiveness ([[albedo]]) of the ice led to further cooling and the formation of more ice, until the entire Earth was covered in ice and stabilized in a new ice-covered equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Budyko"&gt;{{cite journal

While Budyko's model showed that this ice-albedo stability could happen, he concluded that it had in fact never happened, because his model offered no way to escape from such a feedback loop. In 1971, Aron Faegre, an American physicist, showed that a similar energy-balance model predicted three stable global climates, one of which was snowball earth.&lt;ref name="Faegre"&gt;{{cite journal

This model introduced [[Edward Norton Lorenz]]'s concept of intransitivity indicating that there could be a major jump from one climate to another, including to snowball earth.

The term "snowball Earth" was coined by [[Joseph Kirschvink]] in a short paper published in 1992 within a lengthy volume concerning the biology of the [[Proterozoic]] eon.&lt;ref name="Kirschvink" /&gt; The major contributions from this work were: (1) the recognition that the presence of [[banded iron formation]]s is consistent with such a global glacial episode, and (2) the introduction of a mechanism by which to escape from a completely ice-covered Earth—specifically, the accumulation of {{co2}} from volcanic outgassing leading to an ultra-[[greenhouse effect]].

[[Franklyn Van Houten]]'s discovery of a consistent geological pattern in which lake levels rose and fell is now known as the "Van Houten cycle". His studies of phosphorus deposits and [[banded iron formations]] in sedimentary rocks made him an early adherent of the "snowball Earth" hypothesis postulating that the planet's surface froze more than 650 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S28/44/69O99/index.xml?section=topstories Princeton University - Franklyn Van Houten, expert on sedimentary rocks, dies at 96&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in the notion of a snowball Earth increased dramatically after [[Paul F. Hoffman]] and his co-workers applied Kirschvink's ideas to a succession of Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks in [[Namibia]] and elaborated upon the hypothesis in the journal ''Science'' in 1998 by incorporating such observations as the occurrence of [[cap carbonate]]s.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the equator. Therefore, the presence of glacial deposits within the [[tropics]] suggests global ice cover.

Critical to an assessment of the validity of the theory, therefore, is an understanding of the reliability and significance of the evidence that led to the belief that ice ever reached the tropics. This evidence must prove two things:
# that a bed contains sedimentary structures that could have been created only by glacial activity;
# that the bed lay within the tropics when it was deposited.

During a period of global glaciation, it must also be demonstrated that glaciers were active at different global locations at the same time, and that no other deposits of the same age are in existence.

This last point is very difficult to prove. Before the [[Ediacaran]], the [[biostratigraphy|biostratigraphic]] markers usually used to correlate rocks are absent; therefore there is no way to prove that rocks in different places across the globe were deposited at precisely the same time. The best that can be done is to estimate the age of the rocks using [[radiometry|radiometric]] methods, which are rarely accurate to better than a million years or so.&lt;ref name=Eyles2004/&gt;

The first two points are often the source of contention on a case-to-case basis. Many glacial features can also be created by non-glacial means, and estimating the approximate latitudes of landmasses even as recently as {{Ma|200}} can be riddled with difficulties.&lt;ref name=Briden1971&gt;{{cite journal

===Palaeomagnetism===
The snowball Earth hypothesis was first posited to explain what were then considered to be glacial deposits near the equator. Since tectonic plates move slowly over time, ascertaining their position at a given point in Earth's long history is not easy. In addition to considerations of how the recognizable landmasses could have fit together, the latitude at which a rock was deposited can be constrained by palaeomagnetism.

When [[sedimentary rock]]s form, magnetic minerals within them tend to align themselves with the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. Through the precise measurement of this [[palaeomagnetism]], it is possible to estimate the [[latitude]] (but not the [[longitude]]) where the rock matrix was formed. Palaeomagnetic measurements have indicated that some sediments of glacial origin in the [[Neoproterozoic]] rock record were deposited within 10 degrees of the equator,&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the accuracy of this reconstruction is in question.&lt;ref name=Eyles2004 /&gt; This palaeomagnetic location of apparently glacial sediments (such as [[dropstone]]s) has been taken to suggest that glaciers extended from land to sea level in tropical latitudes at the time the sediments were deposited.

Skeptics suggest that the palaeomagnetic data could be corrupted if Earth's ancient magnetic field was substantially different from today's. Depending on the rate of cooling of Earth's core, it is possible that during the Proterozoic, the [[magnetic field]] did not approximate a simple [[dipole|dipolar]] distribution, with north and south magnetic poles roughly aligning with the planet's axis as they do today. Instead, a hotter core may have circulated more vigorously and given rise to 4, 8 or more poles. Palaeomagnetic data would then have to be re-interpreted, as the sedimentary minerals could have aligned pointing to a 'West Pole' rather than the North Pole. Alternatively, Earth's dipolar field could have been oriented such that the poles were close to the equator. This hypothesis has been posited to explain the extraordinarily rapid motion of the magnetic poles implied by the Ediacaran palaeomagnetic record; the alleged motion of the north pole would occur around the same time as the Gaskiers glaciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.epsl.2010.02.038| title = Incompatible Ediacaran paleomagnetic directions suggest an equatorial geomagnetic dipole hypothesis| year = 2010| last1 = Abrajevitch | first1 = A.| last2 = Van Der Voo | first2 = R.| journal = Earth and Planetary Science Letters| volume = 293| issue = 1–2| pages = 164–170| bibcode=2010E&amp;PSL.293..164A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another weakness of reliance on palaeomagnetic data is the difficulty in determining whether the magnetic signal recorded is original, or whether it has been reset by later activity. For example, a mountain-building [[orogeny]] releases hot water as a by-product of metamorphic reactions; this water can circulate to rocks thousands of kilometers away and reset their magnetic signature. This makes the authenticity of rocks older than a few million years difficult to determine without painstaking mineralogical observations.&lt;ref

Sedimentary rocks that are deposited by glaciers have distinctive features that enable their identification. Long before the advent of the ''snowball Earth'' hypothesis many [[Neoproterozoic]] sediments had been interpreted as having a glacial origin, including some apparently at tropical latitudes at the time of their deposition.

It appears that some deposits formed during the snowball period could only have formed in the presence of an active hydrological cycle.

===Carbon isotope ratios===
There are two stable [[isotope]]s of carbon in [[sea water]]: [[carbon-12]] (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C) and the rare [[carbon-13]] (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C), which makes up about 1.109 percent of carbon atoms.

Biochemical processes, of which [[photosynthesis]] is one, tend to preferentially incorporate the lighter &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C isotope. Thus ocean-dwelling photosynthesizers, both [[protist]]s and [[algae]], tend to be very slightly depleted in &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, relative to the abundance found in the primary [[volcanic]] sources of Earth's carbon. Therefore, an ocean with photosynthetic life will have a lower &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C ratio within organic remains, and a higher ratio in corresponding ocean water. The organic component of the lithified sediments will remain very slightly, but measurably, depleted in &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C.

During the proposed episode of snowball Earth, there are rapid and extreme negative excursions in the ratio of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C to &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C.&lt;ref name=Rothman2003&gt;{{cite journal |author1=D.H.

===Banded iron formations===
[[Image:Black-band ironstone (aka).jpg|thumb|2.1 billion-year-old rock with black-band ironstone]]
[[Banded iron formations]] (BIF) are sedimentary rocks of layered [[iron oxide]] and iron-poor [[chert]]. In the presence of oxygen, [[iron]] naturally rusts and becomes insoluble in water. The banded iron formations are commonly very old and their deposition is often related to the oxidation of the Earth's atmosphere during the [[Palaeoproterozoic]] era, when dissolved iron in the ocean came in contact with photosynthetically produced oxygen and precipitated out as iron oxide.

The bands were produced at the [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]] between an [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] and an oxygenated ocean. Since today's atmosphere is [[oxygen]]-rich (nearly 21% by volume) and in contact with the oceans, it is not possible to accumulate enough iron oxide to deposit a banded formation. The only extensive iron formations that were deposited after the Palaeoproterozoic (after 1.8 billion years ago) are associated with [[Cryogenian]] glacial deposits.

For such iron-rich rocks to be deposited there would have to be anoxia in the ocean, so that much dissolved iron (as [[ferrous oxide]]) could accumulate before it met an oxidant that would precipitate it as [[ferric]] oxide. For the ocean to become anoxic it must have limited gas exchange with the oxygenated atmosphere. Proponents of the hypothesis argue that the reappearance of BIF in the sedimentary record is a result of limited oxygen levels in an ocean sealed by sea-ice,&lt;ref name="Kirschvink"&gt;{{cite book

Being isolated from the oceans, such lakes could have been stagnant and anoxic at depth, much like today's [[Black Sea]]; a sufficient input of iron could provide the necessary conditions for BIF formation.&lt;ref name=Eyles2004 /&gt; A further difficulty in suggesting that BIFs marked the end of the glaciation is that they are found interbedded with glacial sediments.&lt;ref name=Young1995/&gt; BIFs are also strikingly absent during the [[Marinoan glaciation]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

=== Cap carbonate rocks ===
[[Image:Grosser Aletschgletscher 3178.JPG|thumb|left|A present-day glacier]]

The formation of such sedimentary rocks could be caused by a large influx of positively charged [[ions]], as would be produced by rapid weathering during the extreme greenhouse following a snowball Earth event. The {{delta|13|C|link}} isotopic signature of the cap carbonates is near −5&amp;nbsp;‰, consistent with the value of the mantle—such a low value is usually/could be taken to signify an absence of life, since photosynthesis usually acts to raise the value; alternatively the release of methane deposits could have lowered it from a higher value, and counterbalance the effects of photosynthesis.

The precise mechanism involved in the formation of cap carbonates is not clear, but the most cited explanation suggests that at the melting of a snowball Earth, water would dissolve the abundant {{co2}} from the [[atmosphere]] to form [[carbonic acid]], which would fall as [[acid rain]]. This would weather exposed [[silicate]] and [[carbonate]] [[rock (geology)|rock]] (including readily attacked glacial debris), releasing large amounts of [[calcium]], which when washed into the ocean would form distinctively textured layers of carbonate sedimentary rock. Such an [[abiotic]] "[[cap carbonate]]" sediment can be found on top of the glacial till that gave rise to the snowball Earth hypothesis.

However, there are some problems with the designation of a glacial origin to cap carbonates. Firstly, the high carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere would cause the oceans to become acidic, and dissolve any carbonates contained within—starkly at odds with the deposition of cap carbonates. Further, the thickness of some cap carbonates is far above what could reasonably be produced in the relatively quick deglaciations. The cause is further weakened by the lack of cap carbonates above many sequences of clear glacial origin at a similar time and the occurrence of similar carbonates within the sequences of proposed glacial origin.&lt;ref name=Eyles2004 /&gt; An alternative mechanism, which may have produced the [[Doushantuo]] cap carbonate at least, is the rapid, widespread release of methane. This accounts for incredibly low—as low as −48&amp;nbsp;‰—{{delta|13|C|}} values—as well as unusual sedimentary features which appear to have been formed by the flow of gas through the sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Changing acidity===
Isotopes of the element [[boron]] suggest that the [[pH]] of the oceans dropped dramatically before and after the [[Marinoan]] glaciation.&lt;ref name=Kasemann2005&gt;δ&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B, in {{cite journal

This may indicate a buildup of [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere, some of which would dissolve into the oceans to form [[carbonic acid]]. Although the boron variations may be evidence of extreme [[climate change]], they need not imply a global glaciation.

===Space dust===
Earth's surface is very depleted in the element [[iridium]], which primarily resides in the [[Inner core|Earth's core]]. The only significant source of the element at the surface is [[cosmogenic|cosmic particles]] that reach Earth. During a snowball Earth, iridium would accumulate on the ice sheets, and when the ice melted the resulting layer of sediment would be rich in iridium. An [[iridium anomaly]] has been discovered at the base of the cap carbonate formations, and has been used to suggest that the glacial episode lasted for at least 3 million years,&lt;ref name=Bodiselitsch&gt;{{cite journal

===Cyclic climate fluctuations===
Using the ratio of mobile [[cation]]s to those that remain in soils during [[chemical weathering]] (the chemical index of alteration), it has been shown that chemical weathering varied in a cyclic fashion within a glacial succession, increasing during interglacial periods and decreasing during cold and arid glacial periods.&lt;ref name="Rieu"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of these deposits is highly reliant upon their dating. Glacial sediments are difficult to date, and the closest dated bed to the Portaskaig group is 8&amp;nbsp;km stratigraphically above the beds of interest. Its dating to 600&amp;nbsp;Ma means the beds can be tentatively correlated to the Sturtian glaciation, but they may represent the advance or retreat of a snowball Earth.

==Mechanisms==
[[Image:SnowballSimulations.jpg|350px|thumb|right|One computer simulation of conditions during a snowball Earth period&lt;ref name=NatureAttrib&gt;Reprinted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd.: Nature 405:425-429, copyright 2000. See Hyde ''et al.'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The initiation of a snowball Earth event would involve some initial cooling mechanism, which would result in an increase in Earth's coverage of snow and ice. The increase in Earth's coverage of snow and ice would in turn increase Earth's [[albedo]], which would result in [[positive feedback]] for cooling. If enough snow and ice accumulates, run-away cooling would result. This positive feedback is facilitated by an equatorial continental distribution, which would allow ice to accumulate in the regions closer to the equator, where [[solar radiation]] is most direct.

Many possible triggering mechanisms could account for the beginning of a snowball Earth, such as the eruption of a [[supervolcano]], a reduction in the atmospheric concentration of [[greenhouse gas]]es such as [[methane]] and/or [[carbon dioxide]], changes in [[solar variation|Solar energy output]], or perturbations of [[Earth's orbit]]. Regardless of the trigger, initial cooling results in an increase in the area of Earth's surface covered by ice and snow, and the additional ice and snow reflects more Solar energy back to space, further cooling Earth and further increasing the area of Earth's surface covered by ice and snow. This positive feedback loop could eventually produce a frozen [[equator]] as cold as modern [[Antarctica]].

[[Global warming]] associated with large accumulations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over millions of years, emitted primarily by volcanic activity, is the proposed trigger for melting a snowball Earth. Due to positive feedback for melting, the eventual melting of the snow and ice covering most of Earth's surface would require as little as a millennium.

===Continental distribution===
A tropical distribution of the continents is, perhaps counter-intuitively, necessary to allow the initiation of a snowball Earth.&lt;ref name=Hoffman2005/&gt;
Firstly, tropical continents are more reflective than open ocean, and so absorb less of the Sun's heat: most absorption of Solar energy on Earth today occurs in tropical oceans.&lt;ref name=Jacobsen2001&gt;{{cite journal

| pmid = 11507621
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, tropical continents are subject to more rainfall, which leads to increased river discharge—and erosion.
When exposed to air, [[silicate]] rocks undergo weathering reactions which remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. These reactions proceed in the general form: Rock-forming mineral + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → cations + bicarbonate + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. An example of such a reaction is the weathering of [[wollastonite]]:
: CaSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The released [[calcium]] cations react with the dissolved [[bicarbonate]] in the ocean to form [[calcium carbonate]] as a chemically precipitated [[sedimentary rock]]. This transfers [[carbon dioxide]], a greenhouse gas, from the air into the [[geosphere]], and, in steady-state on geologic time scales, offsets the carbon dioxide emitted from [[volcano]]es into the atmosphere.

A paucity of suitable sediments for analysis makes precise continental distribution during the Neoproterozoic difficult to establish.&lt;ref name=Meert2004&gt;{{cite journal

Additional factors that may have contributed to the onset of the Neoproterozoic snowball include the introduction of atmospheric free oxygen, which may have reached sufficient quantities to react with [[Atmospheric methane|methane in the atmosphere]], oxidizing it to carbon dioxide, a much weaker greenhouse gas,&lt;ref name=Kerr1999&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a younger—thus fainter—Sun, which would have emitted 6 percent less radiation in the Neoproterozoic.&lt;ref name=Eyles2004 /&gt;

Normally, as Earth gets colder due to natural climatic fluctuations and changes in incoming solar radiation, the cooling slows these weathering reactions. As a result, less carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere and Earth warms as this greenhouse gas accumulates—this '[[negative feedback]]' process limits the magnitude of cooling. During the [[Cryogenian]] period, however, Earth's continents were all at [[Tropics|tropical]] latitudes, which made this moderating process less effective, as high weathering rates continued on land even as Earth cooled. This let ice advance beyond the polar regions. Once ice advanced to within 30° of the equator,&lt;ref name=Kirschvink2002&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a positive feedback could ensue such that the increased reflectiveness ([[albedo]]) of the ice led to further cooling and the formation of more ice, until the whole Earth is ice-covered.

Polar continents, due to low rates of [[evaporation]], are too dry to allow substantial carbon deposition—restricting the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide that can be removed from the [[carbon cycle]]. A gradual rise of the proportion of the [[isotope]] carbon-13 relative to carbon-12 in sediments pre-dating "global" glaciation indicates that {{co2}} draw-down before snowball Earths was a slow and continuous process.&lt;ref name=Schrag2002&gt;{{cite journal

On the continents, the melting of [[glacier]]s would release massive amounts of glacial deposit, which would erode and weather. The resulting sediments supplied to the ocean would be high in nutrients such as [[phosphorus]], which combined with the abundance of {{co2}} would trigger a [[cyanobacteria]] population explosion, which would cause a relatively rapid reoxygenation of the atmosphere, which may have contributed to the rise of the [[Ediacaran biota]] and the subsequent [[Cambrian explosion]]—a higher oxygen concentration allowing large multicellular lifeforms to develop. Although the [[positive feedback]] loop would melt the ice in geological short order, perhaps less than 1,000 years, replenishment of atmospheric oxygen and depletion of the {{co2}} levels would take further [[millennium|millennia]].

More recent evidence suggests that with colder oceanic temperatures, the resulting higher ability of the oceans to dissolve gases led to the carbon content of sea water being more quickly oxidized to carbon dioxide. This leads directly to an increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide, enhanced greenhouse warming of Earth's surface, and the prevention of a total snowball state.&lt;ref&gt;Peltier, W. Richard, Yonggang Liu &amp; John W. Crowley, (2007), "Snowball Earth prevention by dissolved organic carbon remineralization" (Nature 450, 813-818 (6 December 2007) | {{doi|10.1038/nature06354}})&lt;/ref&gt;

During millions of years, [[cryoconite]] would have accumulated on and inside the ice. [[Psychrophile|Psychrophilic]] microorganisms, volcanic ash and dust from ice-free locations would settle on ice covering several million square kilometers. Once the ice started to melt, these layers would become visible and coloring the icy surfaces dark, helping to accelerate the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=27422766 | doi=10.1111/gbi.12191 | volume=14 | title=Cryoconite pans on Snowball Earth: supraglacial oases for Cryogenian eukaryotes? | year=2016 | journal=Geobiology | pages=531–542 | author=Hoffman PF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultraviolet light from the Sun would also produce hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) when it hits water molecules. Normally hydrogen peroxide is broken down by sunlight, but some would have been trapped inside the ice. When the glaciers started to melt, it would have been released in both the ocean and the atmosphere, where it was split into water and oxygen molecules, leading to an increase in atmospheric oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10662-did-snowball-earths-melting-let-oxygen-fuel-life/ Did snowball Earth’s melting let oxygen fuel life?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slushball Earth hypothesis===
While the presence of glaciers is not disputed, the idea that the entire planet was covered in ice is more contentious, leading some scientists to posit a "slushball Earth", in which a band of ice-free, or ice-thin, waters remains around the [[equator]], allowing for a continued [[hydrologic cycle]].

This hypothesis appeals to scientists who observe certain features of the sedimentary record that can only be formed under open water, or rapidly moving ice (which would require somewhere ice-free to move to). Recent research observed geochemical cyclicity in [[clastic rocks]], showing that the "snowball" periods were punctuated by warm spells, similar to [[ice age]] cycles in recent Earth history. Attempts to construct computer models of a snowball Earth have also struggled to accommodate global ice cover without fundamental changes in the laws and constants which govern the planet.

A less extreme snowball Earth hypothesis involves continually evolving continental configurations and changes in ocean circulation.&lt;ref name=Harland2007&gt;{{cite journal

==="Zipper rift" hypothesis===
&lt;!-- I don't feel I've done this paper justice here; it may be because I've not grasped it fully, but may also be that their model's not quite as awe-inspiring as it's made out to be. Please do feel free to have a look at the paper—message Verisimilus if you can't find it online—and improve this section if you feel you can! --&gt;
Nick Eyles suggest that the Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth was in fact no different from any other glaciation in Earth's history, and that efforts to find a single cause are likely to end in failure.&lt;ref name=Eyles2004 /&gt; The "Zipper rift" hypothesis proposes two pulses of continental "unzipping"—first, the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia, forming the proto-Pacific Ocean; then the splitting of the continent [[Baltica]] from [[Laurentia]], forming the proto-Atlantic—coincided with the glaciated periods.
The associated tectonic uplift would form high plateaus, just as the [[East African Rift]] is responsible for high topography; this high ground could then host glaciers.

Banded iron formations have been taken as unavoidable evidence for global ice cover, since they require dissolved iron ions and anoxic waters to form; however, the limited extent of the Neoproterozoic banded iron deposits means that they may not have formed in frozen oceans, but instead in inland seas. Such seas can experience a wide range of chemistries; high rates of evaporation could concentrate iron ions, and a periodic lack of circulation could allow anoxic bottom water to form.

Continental rifting, with associated subsidence, tends to produce such landlocked water bodies. This rifting, and associated subsidence, would produce the space for the fast deposition of sediments, negating the need for an immense and rapid melting to raise the global sea levels.

===High-obliquity hypothesis===
A competing hypothesis to explain the presence of ice on the equatorial continents was that Earth's [[axial tilt]] was quite high, in the vicinity of 60°, which would place Earth's land in high "latitudes", although supporting evidence is scarce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url= http://www.livescience.com/7105-day-earth-fell.html
| title= LiveScience.com: The Day The Earth Fell Over}}&lt;/ref&gt; A less extreme possibility would be that it was merely Earth's [[Poles of astronomical bodies|magnetic pole]] that wandered to this inclination, as the magnetic readings which suggested ice-filled continents depends on the magnetic and rotational poles being relatively similar. In either of these two situations, the freeze would be limited to relatively small areas, as is the case today; severe changes to Earth's climate are not necessary.

This hypothesis, created to explain palaeomagnetic data, suggests that Earth's axis of rotation shifted one or more times during the general time-frame attributed to snowball Earth.

Several alternative explanations for the evidence have been proposed.

==Survival of life through frozen periods==
[[Image:Blacksmoker in Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|right|A [[black smoker]], a type of hydrothermal vent]]
A tremendous glaciation would curtail photosynthetic life on Earth, thus depleting atmospheric oxygen, and thereby allowing non-oxidized iron-rich rocks to form.

Detractors argue that this kind of glaciation would have made life extinct entirely. However, microfossils such as [[stromatolite]]s and [[oncolite]]s prove that, in shallow marine environments at least, life did not suffer any perturbation. Instead life developed a trophic complexity and survived the cold period unscathed.&lt;ref name=Corsetti2003&gt;{{cite journal

==Implications==
A snowball Earth has profound implications in the history of [[life]] on Earth. While many [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] have been postulated, global ice cover would certainly have ravaged [[ecosystem]]s dependent on sunlight. Geochemical evidence from rocks associated with low-latitude glacial deposits have been interpreted to show a crash in oceanic life during the glacials.

Because about half of the oceans' water was frozen solid as ice, the remaining water would be twice as salty as it is today, lowering its freezing point. When the ice sheet melted, it would cover the oceans with a layer of hot freshwater up to 2 kilometres thick. Only after the hot surface water mixed with the colder and deeper saltwater did the sea return to a warmer and less salty state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/2130525-snowball-earth-melting-led-to-freshwater-ocean-2-kilometres-deep/ Snowball Earth melting led to freshwater ocean 2 kilometres deep]&lt;/ref&gt;

The melting of the ice may have presented many new opportunities for diversification, and may indeed have driven the rapid evolution which took place at the end of the [[Cryogenian]] period.

===Effect on early evolution===
[[Image:DickinsoniaCostata.jpg|thumb|right|222px|''[[Dickinsonia]] costata'', an [[Ediacaran]] organism of unknown affinity, with a quilted appearance]]
The [[Neoproterozoic]] was a time of remarkable diversification of multicellular organisms, including animals. Organism size and complexity increased considerably after the end of the snowball glaciations. This development of multicellular organisms may have been the result of increased evolutionary pressures resulting from multiple [[Greenhouse and icehouse Earth|icehouse-hothouse]] cycles; in this sense, snowball Earth episodes may have "pumped" evolution. Alternatively, fluctuating nutrient levels and rising oxygen may have played a part. Another major glacial episode may have ended just a few million years before the [[Cambrian explosion]].

Mechanistically, the effect of snowball Earth (in particular the later glaciations) on complex life is likely to have occurred through the process of [[kin selection]]. Organ-scale differentiation, in particular the terminal (irreversible) differentiation present in animals, requires the individual cell (and the genes contained within it) to "sacrifice" their ability to reproduce, so that the colony is not disrupted. From the short-term perspective of the gene, more offspring will be gained by causing the cell in which it is contained to ignore any signals received from the colony, and to reproduce at the maximum rate, regardless of the implications for the wider group. Today, this incentive explains the formation of tumours in animals and plants.

It has been argued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1472-4669.2007.00115.x|url=http://researchpages.net/media/resources/2007/06/21/richtimhywelfinal.pdf|title=Neoproterozoic 'snowball Earth' glaciations and the evolution of altruism|vauthors=Boyle RA, Lenton TM, ((Williams HTP)) |journal=Geobiology|year=2007|accessdate=17 June 2011|volume=5|issue=4|pages=337–349}}&lt;/ref&gt; that because snowball Earth would undoubtedly have decimated the population size of any given species, the extremely small populations that resulted would all have been descended from a small number of individuals (see [[founder effect]]), and consequently the average relatedness between any two individuals (in this case individual cells) would have been exceptionally high as a result of glaciations. Altruism is known to increase from rarity when relatedness (R) exceeds the ratio of the cost (C) to the altruist (in this case, the cell giving up its own reproduction by differentiating), to the benefit (B) to the recipient of altruism (the germ line of the colony, that reproduces as a result of the differentiation), i.e. R &gt; C/B (see [[Hamilton's rule]]). The evolutionary pressure of the high relatedness in the context of a post-glaciation population boom may have been sufficient to overcome the reproductive cost of forming a complex animal, for the first time in Earth's history.

There is also a rival hypothesis which has been gaining currency in recent years: that early snowball Earths did not so much ''affect'' the evolution of life on Earth as result from it. In fact the two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. The idea is that Earth's life forms affect the global carbon cycle and so major evolutionary events alter the carbon cycle, redistributing carbon within various reservoirs within the biosphere system and in the process temporarily lowering the atmospheric (greenhouse) carbon reservoir until the revised biosphere system settled into a new state. The Snowball I episode (of the [[Huronian glaciation]] 2.4 to 2.1 billion years) and Snowball II (of the Precambrian's [[Cryogenian]] between 580–850 million years and which itself had a number of distinct episodes) are respectively thought to be caused by the evolution of [[Carbon fixation#Oxygenic photosynthesis|oxygenic photosynthesis]] and then the rise of more advanced multicellular animal life and life's colonization of the land.&lt;ref&gt;Cowie, J., (2007) ''Climate Change: Biological and Human Aspects''.

Global ice cover, if it existed, may—in concert with geothermal heating—have led to a lively, well mixed ocean with great vertical convective circulation.&lt;ref name="Ashkenazy2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ashkenazy | first1 = Y. | last2 = Gildor | first2 = H. | last3 = Losch | first3 = M. | last4 = MacDonald | first4 = F.

In the absence of this methane greenhouse, temperatures plunged and a snowball event could have occurred.&lt;ref name="Kopp"&gt;{{cite journal

===Karoo Ice Age===
Before the theory of continental drift, glacial deposits in [[Carboniferous]] strata in tropical continents areas such as India and South America led to speculation that the [[Karoo Ice Age]] glaciation reached into the tropics. However, a continental reconstruction shows that ice was in fact constrained to the polar parts of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]].

Because reintroduction may involve returning native species to localities where they had been extirpated, some prefer the term "'''reestablishment'''".&lt;ref name="Campbell-Palmer 2010"/&gt;

==Methods for sourcing individuals==
There are a variety of approaches to species reintroduction. The optimal strategy will depend on the biology of the organism.&lt;ref name="IUCN 2017 Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web|title=IUCN Guidelines for Restorations and Other Conservation Translocations|url=http://www.iucn-whsg.org/sites/default/files/IUCN%20Guidelines%20to%20Reintroduction%20and%20Other%20Conservation%20Translocations.pdf|website=IUCN|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first matter to address when beginning a species reintroduction is whether to source individuals ''in situ'', from wild populations, or ''ex situ'', from captivity in a zoo or botanic garden, for example.

===''In situ'' sourcing===
''[[In situ]]'' sourcing for restorations involves moving individuals from an existing wild population to a new site where the species was formerly extirpated. Ideally, populations should be sourced ''in situ'' when possible due to the numerous risks associated with reintroducing organisms from captive populations to the wild.&lt;ref name="IUCN 2017 Ex Situ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maunder|first1=Mike|last2=Byers|first2=Onnie|title=The IUCN Technical Guidelines on the Management of Ex Situ Populations for Conservation: reflecting major changes in the application of ex situ conservation|journal=Oryx|date=January 2005|volume=39|issue=1|pages=95–98|doi=10.1017/S0030605305000177|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/oryx/article/iucn-technical-guidelines-on-the-management-of-ex-situ-populations-for-conservation-reflecting-major-changes-in-the-application-of-ex-situ-conservation/33B02176D7D59AE939185EAFDC42915A|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure that reintroduced populations have the best chance of surviving and reproducing, individuals should be sourced from populations that genetically and ecologically resemble the recipient population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Generally, sourcing from populations with similar environmental conditions to the reintroduction site will maximize the chance that reintroduced individuals are well adapted to the habitat of the reintroduction site .&lt;ref name="Houde et al 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Houde|first1=Aimee|last2=Garner|first2=Shawn|last3=Neff|first3=Bryan|title=Restoring species through reintroductions: strategies for source population selection|journal=Restoration Ecology|date=2015|volume=23|issue=6|pages=746–753|doi=10.1111/rec.12280|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montalvo|first=Arlee M.|last2=Ellstrand|first2=Norman C.|date=2000-08-15|title=Transplantation of the Subshrub Lotus scoparius: Testing the Home-Site Advantage Hypothesis|url=https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.99250.x|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=1034–1045|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.99250.x|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One consideration for ''in situ'' sourcing is at which life stage the organisms should be collected, transported, and reintroduced. For instance, with plants, it is often ideal to transport them as seeds as they have the best chance of surviving translocation at this stage. However, some plants are difficult to establish as seed and may need to be translocated as juveniles or adults.&lt;ref name="IUCN 2017 Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web|title=IUCN Guidelines for Restorations and Other Conservation Translocations|url=http://www.iucn-whsg.org/sites/default/files/IUCN%20Guidelines%20to%20Reintroduction%20and%20Other%20Conservation%20Translocations.pdf|website=IUCN|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ex situ'' sourcing===
In situations where ''in situ'' collection of individuals is not feasible, such as for rare and endangered species with too few individuals existing in the wild, [[Ex situ conservation|''ex situ'']] collection possible. 
''Ex situ'' collection methods allow storage of individuals that have high potential for reintroduction. Storage examples include [[germplasm]] stored in seed banks, sperm and egg banks, [[cryopreservation]], and tissue culture.&lt;ref name="IUCN 2017 Ex Situ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maunder|first1=Mike|last2=Byers|first2=Onnie|title=The IUCN Technical Guidelines on the Management of Ex Situ Populations for Conservation: reflecting major changes in the application of ex situ conservation|journal=Oryx|date=January 2005|volume=39|issue=1|pages=95–98|doi=10.1017/S0030605305000177|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/oryx/article/iucn-technical-guidelines-on-the-management-of-ex-situ-populations-for-conservation-reflecting-major-changes-in-the-application-of-ex-situ-conservation/33B02176D7D59AE939185EAFDC42915A|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods that allow for storage of a high numbers of individuals also aim to maximize genetic diversity. Stored materials generally have long lifespans in storage, but some species do lose viability when stored as seed.&lt;ref name="Walters 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walters|first1=Christina|last2=Wheeler|first2=Lana|last3=Grotenhuis|first3=Judith|title=Longevity of seeds stored in a genebank: species characteristics|journal=Seed Science Research|date=2005|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–20|accessdate=|doi=10.1079/ssr2004195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tissue culture and cryopreservation techniques have only been perfected for a few species.&lt;ref name="Engelmann 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engelmann|first1=Florent|title=Use of biotechnologies for the conservation of plant biodiversity|journal=In Vitro Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology-Plant|date=2011|volume=47|issue=1|pages=5–16|accessdate=|doi=10.1007/s11627-010-9327-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Organisms may also be kept in living collections in captivity. Living collections are more costly than storing [[germplasm]] and hence can support only a fraction of the individuals that ''ex situ'' sourcing can.&lt;ref name="IUCN 2017 Ex Situ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maunder|first1=Mike|last2=Byers|first2=Onnie|title=The IUCN Technical Guidelines on the Management of Ex Situ Populations for Conservation: reflecting major changes in the application of ex situ conservation|journal=Oryx|date=January 2005|volume=39|issue=1|pages=95–98|doi=10.1017/S0030605305000177|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/oryx/article/iucn-technical-guidelines-on-the-management-of-ex-situ-populations-for-conservation-reflecting-major-changes-in-the-application-of-ex-situ-conservation/33B02176D7D59AE939185EAFDC42915A|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk increases when sourcing individuals to add to living collections.

==Successes and failures==
Reintroduction biology is a relatively young discipline and continues to be a work in progress.  No strict and accepted definition of reintroduction success exists, but it has been proposed that the criteria widely used to assess the conservation status of endangered taxa, such as the [[IUCN Red List]] criteria, should be used to assess reintroduction success.&lt;ref name="Robert 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robert | first1 = A. | last2 = Colas | first2 = B.  | last3 = Guigon | first3 = I. | last4 = Kerbiriou | first4 = C.  | last5 = Mihoub | first5 = J.B. | last6 = Saint-Jalme | first6 = M.  | last7 = Sarrazin | first7 = F. |year = 2015 | title = Defining reintroduction success using IUCN criteria for threatened species: a demographic assessment | url = | journal = Animal Conservation | volume = 18 | issue = 5| pages = 397–406| doi = 10.1111/acv.12188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful reintroduction programs should yield viable and self-sustainable populations in the long-term.

Many factors can attribute to the success or failure of a reintroduction.  Predators, food, pathogens, competitors, and weather can all affect a reintroduced population's ability to grow, survive, and reproduce.The number of animals reintroduced in an attempt should also vary with factors such as social behavior, expected rates of predation, and density in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wimberger|first=Kirsten|last2=Downs|first2=Colleen T.|last3=Perrin|first3=Mike R.|date=2009-10-01|title=Two Unsuccessful Reintroduction Attempts of Rock Hyraxes (Procavia capensis) into a Reserve in the KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3957/056.039.0213|journal=South African Journal of Wildlife Research|volume=39|issue=2|pages=192–201|doi=10.3957/056.039.0213|issn=0379-4369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals raised in captivity may experience stress during captivity or translocation, which can weaken their immune systems.&lt;ref name="Stamps 2007" /&gt;

This can decrease the species fitness and thus decrease chances for survival.&lt;ref name="Stamps 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stamps | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Swaisgood | first2 = R.R  | year = 2007 | title = Someplace like home: Experience, Habitat selection and Conservation Biology | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 102 | issue = 3–4| pages = 392–409 | doi = 10.1016/j.applanim.2006.05.038 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They state that restoration of the original habitat and amelioration of causes of extinction must be explored and considered as essential conditions for these projects. Unfortunately, the monitoring period that should follow reintroductions often remains neglected.&lt;ref&gt;Sarrazin, F. Barbault, R. (November 1996).  Reintroduction: Challenges and Lessons for Basic Ecology Elsevier Science Volume 11 No. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic considerations ==
When a species has been extirpated from a site where it previously existed, individuals that will comprise the reintroduced population must be sourced from wild or captive populations. When sourcing individuals for reintroduction, it is important to consider [[local adaptation]], adaptation to captivity (for [[ex situ conservation|''ex situ'' conservation]]), the possibility of [[inbreeding depression]] and [[outbreeding depression]], and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[ecology]], and [[genetic diversity]] of the source population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Reintroduced populations experience increased vulnerability to influences of [[Genetic drift|drift]], [[Natural selection|selection]], and [[gene flow]] evolutionary processes due to their small sizes, climatic and ecological differences between source and native habitats, and presence of other mating-compatible populations.&lt;ref name="Frankham 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Latch|first=Emily K.|last2=Rhodes|first2=Olin E.|date=2006-01-21|title=The effects of gene flow and population isolation on the genetic structure of␣reintroduced wild turkey populations: Are genetic signatures of source populations retained?|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10592-005-9089-2|journal=Conservation Genetics|language=en|volume=6|issue=6|pages=981–997|doi=10.1007/s10592-005-9089-2|issn=1566-0621}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sork|first=Victoria L.|date=2015-11-03|title=Gene flow and natural selection shape spatial patterns of genes in tree populations: implications for evolutionary processes and applications |journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=291–310|doi=10.1111/eva.12316 |pmc=4780383|pmid=27087853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the species slated for reintroduction is rare in the wild, it is likely to have unusually low population numbers, and care should be taken to avoid [[inbreeding]] and [[inbreeding depression]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Inbreeding can change the frequency of allele distribution in a population, and potentially result in a change to crucial genetic diversity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, [[outbreeding depression]] can occur if a reintroduced population can hybridize with existing populations in the wild, which can result in offspring with reduced fitness, and less adaptation to local conditions. To minimize both, practitioners should source for individuals in a way that captures as much genetic diversity as possible, and attempt to match source site conditions to local site conditions as much as possible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Capturing as much [[genetic diversity]] as possible, measured as [[heterozygosity]], is  suggested in species reintroductions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some protocols suggest sourcing approximately 30 individuals from a population will capture 95% of the genetic diversity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Maintaining genetic diversity in the recipient population is crucial to avoiding the loss of essential local adaptations, minimizing inbreeding depression, and maximizing fitness of the reintroduced population.

=== Ecological Similarity ===
Plants or animals that undergo reintroduction may exhibit reduced fitness if they are not sufficiently adapted to local environmental conditions. Therefore, researchers should consider ecological and environmental similarity of source and recipient sites when selecting populations for reintroduction. Environmental factors to consider include climate and soil traits (pH, percent clay, silt and sand, percent combustion carbon, percent combustion nitrogen, concentration of Ca, Na, Mg, P, K).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Historically, sourcing plant material for reintroductions has followed the rule "local is best," as the best way to preserve local adaptations, with individuals for reintroductions selected from the most geographically proximate population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havens|first=Kayri|last2=Vitt|first2=Pati|last3=Still|first3=Shannon|last4=Kramer|first4=Andrea T.|last5=Fant|first5=Jeremie B.|last6=Schatz|first6=Katherine|date=2015-01-01|title=Seed Sourcing for Restoration in an Era of Climate Change|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3375/043.035.0116|journal=Natural Areas Journal|volume=35|issue=1|pages=122–133|doi=10.3375/043.035.0116|issn=0885-8608}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, geographic distance was shown in a [[common garden experiment]] to be an insufficient predictor of fitness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, projected climatic shifts induced by [[climate change]] have led to the development of new seed sourcing protocols that aim to source seeds that are best adapted to project climate conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Breed|first=Martin F.|last2=Stead|first2=Michael G.|last3=Ottewell|first3=Kym M.|last4=Gardner|first4=Michael G.|last5=Lowe|first5=Andrew J.|date=2013-02-01|title=Which provenance and where?

A study of the reintroduction of ''[[Castilleja levisecta]]'' found that the source populations most physically near the reintroduction site performed the poorest in a field experiment, while those from the source population whose ecological conditions most closely matched the reintroduction site performed best, demonstrating the importance of matching the evolved adaptations of a population to the conditions at the reintroduction site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Beth|last2=Kaye|first2=Thomas|date=2011|title=Reintroduction of Castilleja levisecta: Effects of Ecological Similarity, Source Population Genetics, and Habitat Quality|url=|journal=Restoration Ecology|volume=19|pages=166–176|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2009.00549.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adaptation to Captivity ===
Some reintroduction programs use plants or animals from captive populations to form a reintroduced population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When reintroducing individuals from a captive population to the wild, there is a risk that they have adapted to captivity due to differential selection of genotypes in captivity versus the wild. 
The genetic basis of this adaptation is selection of rare, [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive]] [[allele]]s that are deleterious in the wild but preferred in captivity.&lt;ref name="Frankham 2008" /&gt; Consequently, animals adapted to captivity show reduced stress tolerance, increased tameness, and loss of local adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frankham|first=Richard|date=2008|title=Genetic adaptation to captivity in species conservation programs|url=|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=17|pages=325–333|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294x.2007.03399.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants also can show adaptations to captivity through changes in drought tolerance, nutrient requirements, and seed dormancy requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ensslin|first=Andreas|last2=Tschöpe|first2=Okka|last3=Burkart|first3=Michael|last4=Joshi|first4=Jasmin|date=2015-12-01|title=Fitness decline and adaptation to novel environments in ex situ plant collections: Current knowledge and future perspectives|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320715301373|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=192|pages=394–401|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2015.10.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extent of adaptation is directly related to intensity of selection, genetic diversity, [[effective population size]] and number of generations in captivity. 
Characteristics selected for in captivity are overwhelmingly disadvantageous in the wild, so such adaptations can lead to reduced fitness following reintroduction. 
Reintroduction projects that introduce wild animals generally experience higher success rates than those that use captive-bred animals.&lt;ref name="Frankham 2008" /&gt; Genetic adaptation to captivity can be minimized through management methods: by maximizing generation length and number of new individuals added to the captive population; minimizing effective population size, number of generations spent in captivity, and [[Natural selection|selection]] pressure; and reducing genetic diversity by [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmenting]] the population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frankham 2008" /&gt; For plants, minimizing adaptation to captivity is usually achieved by sourcing plant material from a [[seed bank]], where individuals are preserved as wild-collected seeds, and have not had the chance to adapt to conditions in captivity. However, this method is only plausible for plants with [[seed dormancy]].&lt;ref name="Frankham 2008" /&gt;

=== Genetic Trade-offs ===
In reintroductions from captivity, translocation of animals from captivity to the wild has implications for both captive and wild populations. Reintroduction of genetically valuable animals from captivity  improves genetic diversity of reintroduced populations while depleting captive populations; conversely, genetically valuable captive-bred animals may be closely related to individuals in the wild and thus increase risk of inbreeding depression if reintroduced. 
Increasing genetic diversity is favored with removal of genetically overrepresented individuals from captive populations and addition of animals with low genetic relatedness to the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Earnhardt|first=Joanne M.|date=November 1999|title=Reintroduction programmes: genetic trade-offs for populations|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-1795.1999.tb00074.x|journal=Animal Conservation|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=279–286|doi=10.1111/j.1469-1795.1999.tb00074.x|issn=1367-9430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/774393970|title=Introduction to conservation genetics|last=1942-|first=Frankham, Richard,|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Ballou, J.

(David Anthony), 1947-|isbn=9781139190244|edition= 2nd |location=Cambridge, UK|oclc=774393970}}&lt;/ref&gt; However in practice, initial reintroduction of individuals with low genetic value to the captive population is recommended to allow for genetic assessment before translocation of valuable individuals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Improving research techniques ==
A cooperative approach to reintroduction by ecologists and biologists could improve research techniques. For both preparation and monitoring of reintroductions,  increasing contacts between academic population biologists and wildlife managers is encouraged within the Survival Species Commission and the IUCN.  The IUCN states that a re-introduction requires a multidisciplinary approach involving a team of persons drawn from a variety of backgrounds.&lt;ref name="SSC Re-introduction Specialist Group 1995"/&gt; A survey by Wolf et al. in 1998 indicated that 64% of reintroduction projects have used subjective opinion to assess habitat quality.&lt;ref name="Stamps 2007"/&gt;  This means that most reintroduction evaluation has been based on human anecdotal evidence and not enough has been based on statistical findings. Seddon et al. (2007) suggest that researchers contemplating future reintroductions should specify goals, overall ecological purpose, and inherent technical and biological limitations of a given reintroduction, and planning and evaluation processes should incorporate both experimental and modeling approaches.&lt;ref name="Seddon 2007" /&gt;

Monitoring the health of individuals, as well as the survival, is important; both before and after the reintroduction. Intervention may be necessary if the situation proves unfavorable.&lt;ref name="SSC Re-introduction Specialist Group 1995"/&gt;  Population dynamics models that integrate demographic parameters and behavioral data recorded in the field can lead to simulations and tests of a priori hypotheses. Using previous results to design further decisions and experiments is a central concept of [[adaptive management]]. In other words, learning by doing can help in future projects. Population ecologists should therefore collaborate with biologists, ecologists, and wildlife management to improve reintroduction programs.&lt;ref name="bgci.org"&gt;BGCI: The global network. Retrieved April 30, 2012 from http://www.bgci.org/ourwork/Ecosystems/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetic monitoring ===
For reintroduced populations to successfully establish and maximize reproductive fitness, practitioners should perform genetic tests to select which individuals will be the founders of reintroduced populations and to continue monitoring populations post-reintroduction.&lt;ref name="IUCN 2017 Guidelines" /&gt; A number of methods are available to measure the genetic relatedness between and variation among individuals within populations. Common genetic diversity assessment tools include [[microsatellite]] markers, [[mitochondrial DNA]] analyses, [[alloenzyme]]s, and [[amplified fragment length polymorphism]] markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SCHWARTZ|first=M|last2=LUIKART|first2=G|last3=WAPLES|first3=R|date=2007|title=Genetic monitoring as a promising tool for conservation and management|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534706002722|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=22|issue=1|pages=25–33|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2006.08.009|issn=0169-5347|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-reintroduction, genetic monitoring tools can be used to obtain data such as population abundance, [[effective population size]], and [[Population stratification|population structure]], and can also be used to identify instances of [[inbreeding]] within reintroduced populations or [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] with existing populations that are genetically compatible. Long-term genetic monitoring is recommended post-reintroduction to track changes in genetic diversity of the reintroduced population and determine success of a reintroduction program. 
Adverse genetic changes such as loss of [[heterozygosity]] may indicate management intervention, such as population supplementation, is necessary for survival of the reintroduced population.&lt;ref name="Haye 877–892"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haye|first=M.

==Re-introduction Specialist Group (RSG)==
The RSG is a network of specialists whose aim is to combat the ongoing and massive [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] by using re-introductions as a responsible tool for the management and restoration of biodiversity. It does this by actively developing and promoting sound inter-disciplinary scientific information, policy, and practice to establish viable wild populations in their natural habitats.
The role of the RSG is to promote the re-establishment of viable populations in the wild of animals and plants. The need for this role was felt due to the increased demand from re-introduction practitioners, the global conservation community and increase in re-introduction projects worldwide.

Increasing numbers of animal and plant species are becoming rare, or even extinct in the wild. In an attempt to re-establish populations, species can – in some instances – be re-introduced into an area, either through translocation from existing wild populations, or by re-introducing captive-bred animals or artificially propagated plants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2020">'''Supercritical hydrolysis''' is a [[chemical engineering]] process in which water in the supercritical state can be employed to achieve a variety of reactions within seconds. To cope with the extremely short times of reaction on an industrial scale, the process should be continuous. This continuity enables the ratio of the amount of water to the other reactant to be less than unity which minimizes the energy needed to heat the water above 374 C, the critical point. Application of the process to biomass provides simple sugars in near quantitative yield by supercritical hydrolysis of the constituent polysaccharides. The phenolic polymer components of the biomass, usually exemplified by lignins, are converted into a water-insoluble liquid mixture of low molecular phenols.

A private company, Renmatix, based in King of Prussia, PA, has developed a supercritical hydrolysis technology to convert a range of non-food biomass feedstocks into cellulosic sugars for application in biochemicals and biofuels. It has a demonstration facility in Georgia, currently capable of processing three dry tons of hardwood biomass into cellulosic sugar daily. In Australia, a government-sponsored entity called Licella, is similarly transforming sawdust. Both processes require high ratios of water to the amount of feedstock. This energy profligacy can be avoided by the use of a plastic-type extruder through which the solid, but wet, biomass is conveyed to a small inductively heated reaction zone as shown by Xtrudx Technologies Inc of Seattle.

Supercritical hydrolysis can be considered a broadly applicable green chemistry process that utilizes water simultaneously as a heat transfer agent, a solvent, a reactant, a source of hydrogen and as a char-reduction component.

'''Surveys of scientists' views on climate change''' – with a focus on human-caused or anthropogenic [[global warming]] (AGW) – have been undertaken since the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Bray_von_Storch_1999"/&gt; A 2016 paper (which was co-authored by [[Naomi Oreskes]], [[Peter Doran]], William Anderegg, Bart Verheggen, Ed Maibach, J.

== Verheggen et al., 2014 ==
In 2014, Bart Verheggen of the [[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]] surveyed 1,868 climate scientists. They found that, consistent with other research, the level of agreement on anthropogenic causation correlated with expertise - 90% of those surveyed with more than 10 peer-reviewed papers related to climate (just under half of survey respondents) explicitly agreed that  greenhouse gases was the main cause of global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verheggen|first1=Bart|last2=Strengers|first2=Bart|last3=Cook|first3=John|last4=van Dorland|first4=Rob|last5=Vringer|first5=Kees|last6=Peters|first6=Jeroen|last7=Visser|first7=Hans|last8=Meyer|first8=Leo|title=Scientists’ Views about Attribution of Global Warming|journal=[[Environmental Science &amp; Technology]]|publisher=[[American Chemical Society]]|date=19 August 2014|volume=48|issue=16|pages=8963–8971|doi=10.1021/es501998e|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es501998e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== John Cook ''et al.'', 2013 ==

Cook ''et al.'' examined 11,944 abstracts from the peer-reviewed scientific literature from 1991–2011 that matched the topics 'global climate change' or 'global warming'.&lt;ref name="John Cook 2013" /&gt; They found that, while 66.4% of them expressed no position on anthropogenic global warming (AGW), of those that did, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are contributing to global warming. They also invited authors to rate their own papers and found that, while 35.5% rated their paper as expressing no position on AGW, 97.2% of the rest endorsed the consensus. In both cases the percentage of endorsements among papers expressing a position was marginally increasing over time. They concluded that the number of papers actually rejecting the consensus on AGW is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research.&lt;ref name="John Cook 2013"/&gt;

In their discussion of the results in 2007, the authors said that the large proportion of abstracts that state no position on AGW is as expected in a consensus situation,&lt;ref name="Oreskes_2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Oreskes|first=Naomi|title=Climate Change: What It Means for Us, Our Children, and Our Grandchildren|year=2007|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=72|url=http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/resources/globalwarming/oreskes-chapter-4.pdf|accessdate=9 August 2013|chapter=The scientific consensus on climate change: how do we know we're not wrong?|quote=[Scientists] generally focus their discussions on questions that are still disputed or unanswered rather than on matters about which everyone agrees}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding that "the fundamental science of AGW is no longer controversial among the publishing science community and the remaining debate in the field has moved on to other topics."&lt;ref name="John Cook 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=John |author2=Dana Nuccitelli |author3=Sarah A Green |author4=Mark Richardson |author5=Bärbel Winkler |author6=Rob Painting |author7=Robert Way |author8=Peter Jacobs |author9=Andrew Skuce|title=Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature|journal=Environmental Research Letters|date=May 2013|volume=8|issue=2|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024 |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024/pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[IOP Publishing]]|authorlink=John Cook (Australian scientist)|bibcode = 2013ERL.....8b4024C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Science &amp; Education'' in August 2013 [[David Legates]] and three coauthors reviewed the corpus used by Cook ''et al.'' In their assessment, "inspection of a claim by Cook ''et al.'' (Environ Res Lett 8:024024, 2013) of 97.1% consensus, heavily relied upon by Bedford and Cook, shows just 0.3% endorsement of the standard definition of consensus: that most warming since 1950 is anthropogenic."

However, as the paper took issue in the definition of consensus, the definition of consensus was split into several levels: In the end, of all the abstracts that took a position on the subject, 22.97% and 72.50% were found to take an explicit but unquantified endorsement position or an implicit endorsement position, respectively.  The 0.3% figure represents abstracts taking a position of "Actually endorsing the standard definition" of all the abstracts (1.02% of all position-taking abstracts), where the "standard definition" was juxtaposed with an "unquantified definition" drawn from the 2013 Cook ''et al.'' paper as follows:
* The unquantified definition: "The consensus position that humans are causing global warming" 
* The standard definition: As stated in their introduction, that "human activity is very likely causing most of the current warming (anthropogenic global warming, or AGW)" 
Criticism was also made to the "arbitrary" exclusion of non-position-taking abstracts as well as other issues of definitions.

[[Craig Idso]], [[Nicola Scafetta]], [[Nir J. Shaviv]] and [[Nils-Axel Mörner]], who question the consensus, were cited in a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' article by [[Joseph Bast]] and [[Roy Spencer (scientist)|Roy Spencer]] disputing the 97% figure, as climate scientists who assert that Cook misrepresented their work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303480304579578462813553136 The Myth of the Climate Change '97%'],  By Joseph Bast And Roy Spencer. Wall Street Journal, May 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate economist [[Richard Tol]] has also been a persistent critic of the Cook ''et al.'' paper, arguing that the authors "used an unrepresentative sample, left out much useful data, used biased observers who disagreed with the authors of the papers they were classifying nearly two-thirds of the time, and collected and analysed the data in such a way as to allow the authors to adjust their preliminary conclusions as they went along".&lt;ref&gt;[http://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2015/06/climate-wars-done-science/ The Climate Wars’ Damage to Science] by [[Matt Ridley]], [[Quadrant magazine]],  June 19th 2015. Ridley credits [[Joanne Nova]] for this summary of Tol's views.&lt;/ref&gt; Cook ''et al.'' replied to Tol's criticisms, pointing out that "the 97% consensus has passed peer-review, while Tol's criticisms have not".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skepticalscience.com/97-percent-consensus-robust.htm The Cook et al. (2013) 97% consensus result is robust], reply posted at [[Skeptical Science]], last updated  5 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

A new paper&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00704-015-1597-5 Learning from mistakes in climate research]&lt;/ref&gt; by Rasmus E. Benestad, Dana Nuccitelli, Stephan Lewandowsky, Katharine Hayhoe, Hans Olav Hygen, Rob van Dorland, and John Cook examined the quality of the 3% of peer-reviewed papers discovered by this work to reject the consensus view. They discovered that "replication reveals a number of methodological flaws, and a pattern of common mistakes emerges that is not visible when looking at single isolated cases".

== Lefsrud and Meyer, 2012 ==

Lefsrud and Meyer surveyed members of the [[Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta]] (APEGA), a professional association for the [[petroleum industry]] in [[Alberta]]. The aims of the study included examining the respondents' "legitimation of themselves as experts on 'the truth', and their attitudes towards regulatory measures."&lt;ref name=or/&gt; Writing later, the authors added, "we surveyed engineers and geologists because their professions dominate the oil industry and their views on climate change influence the positions taken by governments, think tanks and environmental groups."&lt;ref name="Lefsrud and Meyer 2013"/&gt;

The authors found that 99.4% agreed that the global climate is changing but that "the debate of the causes of climate change is particularly virulent among them." Analyzing their responses, the authors labelled 36% of respondents 'comply with Kyoto', as "they express the strong belief that climate change is happening, that it is not a normal cycle of nature, and humans are the main or central cause."&lt;ref name=or/&gt; 'Regulation activists' (10%) "diagnose climate change as being both human- and naturally caused, posing a moderate public risk, with only slight impact on their personal life." Skeptical of anthropogenic warming (sum 51%) they labelled 'nature is overwhelming' (24%), 'economic responsibility' (10%), and 'fatalists' (17%). Respondents giving these responses disagreed in various ways with [[Scientific opinion on climate change|mainstream scientific opinion on climate change]], expressing views such as that climate change is 'natural', that its causes are unknown, that it is harmless, or that regulation such as that represented by [[Kyoto Protocol]] is in itself harmful.&lt;ref name=or&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lefsrud | first1 = L.

They found that respondents that support regulation (46%) ('comply with Kyoto' and 'regulation activists') were "significantly more likely to be lower in the organizational hierarchy, younger, female, and working in government", while those that oppose regulation ('nature is overwhelming' and 'economic responsibility') were "significantly more likely to be more senior in their organizations, male, older, geoscientists, and work in the oil and gas industry".&lt;ref name=or/&gt; Discussing the study in 2013, the authors ask if such political divisions distract decision-makers from confronting the risk that climate change presents to businesses and the economy.&lt;ref name="Lefsrud and Meyer 2013"&gt;"[http://www.socialsciencespace.com/2013/03/risk-management-approach-could-motivate-climate-change-action/ Risk Management Approach Could Motivate Climate Change Action]", Lianne Lefsrud and Renate Meyer, ''[[Social Science Space]]'', March 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Farnsworth and Lichter, 2011 ==

In an October 2011 paper published in the ''[[International Journal of Public Opinion Research]]'', researchers from George Mason University analyzed the results of a survey of 998 scientists working in academia, government, and industry. The scientists polled were members of the [[American Geophysical Union]] or the [[American Meteorological Society]] (AMS) and listed in the 23rd edition of [[American Men and Women of Science]] (AGU), a biographical reference work on leading American scientists, and 489 returned completed questionnaires. Of those who replied, 97% agreed that global temperatures have risen over the past century. 84% agreed that "human-induced greenhouse warming is now occurring," 5% disagreed, and 12% didn't know.&lt;ref&gt;

The number of climate-relevant [[Scientific literature|publications]] authored or coauthored by each researcher was used to define their 'expertise', and the [[Citation impact|number of citations]] for each of the researcher's four highest-cited papers was used to define their 'prominence'. Removing researchers who had authored fewer than 20 climate publications reduced the database to 908 researchers but did not materially alter the results. The authors of the paper say that their database of researchers "is not comprehensive nor designed to be representative of the entire [[Scientific opinion on climate change|climate science community]]," but say that since they drew the researchers from the most high-profile reports and public statements, it is likely that it represents the "strongest and most credentialed" researchers both 'convinced by the evidence' (CE) and 'unconvinced by the evidence' (UE) on the tenets of anthropogenic climate change.&lt;ref name="Expert credibility in climate change"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;[http://news.sciencemag.org/2010/06/scientists-convinced-climate-consensus-more-prominent-opponents-says-paper Scientists 'Convinced' of Climate Consensus More Prominent Than Opponents, Says Paper] by [[Eli Kintisch]], "Science Insider", [[Science (journal)|Science]], 21 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey was designed to take less than two minutes to complete. Results were analyzed globally and by specialization. Among all respondents, 90% agreed that temperatures had generally risen compared to pre-1800 levels, and 82% agreed that humans significantly influence the global temperature. 76 out of the 79 respondents who "listed climate science as their area of expertise, and who also have published more than 50% of their recent peer-reviewed papers on the subject of climate change", thought that mean global temperatures had risen compared to pre-1800s levels. Of those 79 scientists, 75 out of the 77 answered that human activity was a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures, a sample size which would result in a margin of error of 11 percentage points. The remaining two were not asked, because in question one they responded that temperatures had remained relatively constant. Economic geologists and meteorologists were among the biggest doubters, with only 47 percent and 64 percent respectively thinking that human activity was a significant contributing factor. In summary, Doran and Zimmerman wrote:

The survey was composed of 76 questions split into a number of sections. There were sections on the demographics of the respondents, their assessment of the state of climate science, how good the science is, climate change impacts, adaptation and mitigation, their opinion of the IPCC, and how well climate science was being communicated to the public. Most of the answers were on a scale from 1 to 7 from 'not at all' to 'very much'.&lt;ref name=BvS2010/&gt;

In the section on climate change impacts, questions 20 and 21 were relevant to scientific opinion on climate change.
Question 20, "How convinced are you that climate change, whether natural or anthropogenic, is occurring now?" Answers:  67.1% very much convinced (7), 26.7% to some large extent (5–6), 6.2% said to some small extent (2–4), none said not at all.
Question 21, "How convinced are you that most of recent or near future climate change is, or will be, a result of anthropogenic causes?"

== STATS, 2007 ==

In 2007, [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Interactive]] surveyed 489 randomly selected members of either the [[American Meteorological Society]] or the [[American Geophysical Union]] for the [[Statistical Assessment Service]] (STATS) at [[George Mason University]]. The survey found 97% agreed that global temperatures have increased during the past 100 years; 84% say they personally believe human-induced warming is occurring, and 74% agree that "currently available scientific evidence" substantiates its occurrence. Only 5% believe that human activity does not contribute to greenhouse warming; 41% say they thought the effects of global warming would be near catastrophic over the next 50–100 years; 44% say said effects would be moderately dangerous; 13% saw relatively little danger; 56% say global climate change is a mature science; 39% say it is an emerging science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Lavelle |first= Marianne

== Oreskes, 2004 ==

A 2004 article by geologist and historian of science [[Naomi Oreskes]] summarized a study of the scientific literature on climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The author analyzed 928 abstracts of papers from refereed scientific journals between 1993 and 2003, listed with the keywords "global climate change". Oreskes divided the abstracts into six categories: explicit endorsement of the consensus position, evaluation of impacts, mitigation proposals, methods, [[Paleoclimatology|paleoclimate]] analysis, and rejection of the consensus position. 75% of the abstracts were placed in the first three categories, thus either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view; 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, thus taking no position on current [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] climate change; none of the abstracts disagreed with the consensus position, which the author found to be "remarkable". According to the report, "authors evaluating impacts, developing methods, or studying paleoclimatic change might believe that current climate change is natural. However, none of these papers argued that point."

== Early 2000s ==

In 2003, Bray and von Storch conducted a survey of the perspectives of climate scientists on global climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Scientists’ Perceptions of Climate Change Science.|url=https://www.academia.edu/4484361/Climate_Scientists_Perceptions_of_Climate_Change_Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey received 530 responses from 27 different countries. The 2003 survey has been strongly criticized on the grounds that it was performed on the web with no means to verify that the respondents were climate scientists or to prevent multiple submissions. The survey required entry of a username and password, but the username and password were circulated to a climate skeptics mailing list and elsewhere on the internet.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Bray and von Storch defended their results and accused climate change skeptics of interpreting the results with bias. Bray's submission to ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' on December 22, 2004 was rejected.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

One of the questions asked in the survey was ''"To what extent do you agree or disagree that climate change is mostly the result of anthropogenic causes?"'', with a value of 1 indicating strongly agree and a value of 7 indicating strongly disagree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.nature.com/climatefeedback/2007/08/climate_scientists_views_on_cl_1.html Climate scientists’ views on climate change: a survey]&lt;/ref&gt; The results showed a mean of 3.62, with 50 responses (9.4%) indicating "strongly agree" and 54 responses (9.7%) indicating "strongly disagree". The same survey indicates a 72% to 20% endorsement of the IPCC reports as accurate, and a 15% to 80% rejection of the thesis that ''"there is enough uncertainty about the phenomenon of global warming that there is no need for immediate policy decisions."''{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== 1990s ==

* In 1997, the conservative think tank [[Citizens for a Sound Economy]] surveyed America's 48 [[American Association of State Climatologists|state climatologists]] on questions related to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19980525144333/http://www.cse.org/surveyenviroreg100897.htm Citizens For a Sound Economy Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 36 respondents, 44% considered global warming to be a largely natural phenomenon, compared to 17% who considered warming to be largely man-made. 89% agreed that "current science is unable to isolate and measure variations in global temperatures caused ONLY by man-made factors," and 61% said that historical data do not indicate "that fluctuations in global temperatures are attributable to human influences such as burning fossil fuels", though the time scale for the next glacial period was not specified.
* In 1996, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch undertook a survey of climate scientists on attitudes towards global warming and related matters. The results were subsequently published in the [[Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society]].&lt;ref name="Bray_von_Storch_1999"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0477%281999%29080%3C0439%3ACSAEEO%3E2.0.CO%3B2 | title=Climate Science: An Empirical Example of Postnormal Science | journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society | last=Bray | first=Dennis |author2=[[Hans von Storch]]  | year=1999 | accessdate=2007-09-04|format=PDF | doi=10.1175/1520-0477(1999)080&lt;0439:CSAEEO&gt;2.0.CO;2 | volume=80 | pages=439–455 | issn=1520-0477 | issue=3|bibcode = 1999BAMS...80..439B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper addressed the views of climate scientists, with a response rate of 40% from a mail survey questionnaire to 1000 scientists in Germany, the United States and Canada. Most of the scientists accepted that global warming was occurring and appropriate policy action should be taken, but there was wide disagreement about the likely effects on society and almost all agreed that the predictive ability of currently existing models was limited. On a scale of 1 (highest confidence) to 7 (lowest confidence) regarding belief in the ability to make "reasonable predictions" the mean was 4.8 and 5.2 for 10- and 100-year predictions, respectively. On the question of whether global warming is occurring or will occur, the mean response was 3.3, and for future prospects of warming the mean was 2.6.
* A [[Gallup poll]] of 400 members of the [[American Geophysical Union]] and the [[American Meteorological Society]] along with an analysis of reporting on global warming by the [[Center for Media and Public Affairs]], a report on which was issued in 1992. Accounts of the results of that survey differ in their interpretation and even in the basic statistical percentages:
** [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] states that the report said that 67% of the scientists said that human-induced global warming was occurring, with 11% disagreeing and the rest undecided.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1307 R. Nixon, "Limbaughesque Science"], citing a press release by Gallup in the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 9/27/92.&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[George Will]] reported "53 percent do not believe warming has occurred, and another 30 percent are uncertain." (''Washington Post'', September 3, 1992). In a correction Gallup stated: "Most scientists involved in research in this area believe that human-induced global warming is occurring now."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1156 Steve Rendall, "The Hypocrisy of George Will"], FAIR report, citing the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 9/27/92.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stewart, T. R.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albany.edu/cpr/stewart/ Albandy.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Mumpower, J. L., and Reagan-Cirincione, P. (1992). Scientists' opinions about global climate change: Summary of the results of a survey. NAEP (National Association of Environmental Professionals) Newsletter, 17(2), 6-7.
* In 1991, the Center for Science, Technology, and Media conducted a survey of 118 scientists regarding views on the climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.albany.edu/cpr/stewart/Papers/StewartClimateSurvey-1992.pdf |title=T.

The '''Tehran School of Political Science''' ({{lang-fa|مدرسه علوم سياسی تهران}} ''Madraseh-ye olum-e siyasi''), was one of the first modern institutions of higher education in Iran at the turn of the twentieth century. Most of the nation's political elite graduated from the school.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==History==

The School of Political Science was founded in 1899 by [[Hassan Pirnia]]. It was run by the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Iran)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. It later merged with the School of Law (''Madreseh-ye alee-e hoquq''), which had been established in 1918, to form the Faculty of Law and Political Science of the [[University of Tehran]] in 1933.

==People==
===Political===
Many of the school's faculty and [[alumni]] later became ministers and political figures in Iran. Notable examples are:

'''''The Little Red Schoolbook''''' ({{lang-da|Den Lille Røde Bog For Skoleelever}}; {{lang-en|The Little Red Book For School Pupils}}) is a book written by two [[Danish people|Danish]] schoolteachers, [[Søren Hansen (author)|Søren Hansen]] and [[Jesper Jensen (author)|Jesper Jensen]], published in 1969, that was subject to much controversy upon its publication. The book was translated into many languages in the early 1970s. [[Beatrice Faust]] contributed to the Australian edition of ''The Little Red Schoolbook.''&lt;ref&gt;"The Book that Shook the World", Film Australia, 3 November 2007, [[SBS Television]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

The book encourages young people to question societal norms and instructs them on how to do this. Out of 200 pages, it includes 20 pages on [[sex]] and 30 on drugs, including [[alcohol]] and [[tobacco]]. Other topics included adults as "[[paper tiger]]s", the duties of teachers, discipline, examinations, intelligence, and different schools.&lt;ref name=BBCR4 /&gt;

== Reception ==

As a result of its subject matter and its targeted audience of schoolchildren, a number of politicians in many countries criticised the book, fearing that the book would erode the moral fabric of society and be an invitation for anarchy in schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=354431 2005/214/1 Book, Australian Edition 'The little red schoolbook', Powerhouse Museum, Ultimo, New South Wales, Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''LRSB'' was banned in France, Italy and New Zealand.{{cn|date= March 2018}}



In Switzerland, the [[Canton of Bern|Bernese cantonal]] politician [[Hans Martin Sutermeister]] led a campaign against the book. He was successful in temporarily blocking the introduction of the book into the country. The subsequent controversy, however, ended his political career, costing him his job as director of the schools of the Swiss capital and contributed to a split in his party, the [[Ring of Independents]], which led to its mid-term decline.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus H. Thiele-Dohrmann, [http://www.zeit.de/1970/30/Ruhestoerung-in-Bern?page=all “Ruhestörung in Bern.”]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} ''[[Die Zeit]]'' July 24, 1970 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-44943670.html “Der SPIEGEL berichtete: Schüler-Lehrerbeziehung.”] ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' 28/1970, July 6, 1970 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the book was the subject of a successful prosecution under the [[Obscene Publications Act]], a decision that was upheld by the Appeal Court and subsequently by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in the case known as ''[[Handyside v United Kingdom]]''. The government however allowed a second, censored edition to be published, in which some of the passages criticised in court were amended or cut.&lt;ref name=BBCR4 /&gt;

The book was banned in the Australian state of [[Queensland]] by the Queensland Literature Board of Review in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.slq.qld.gov.au/jol/2017/05/04/little-red-school-book/|title=Little Red School Book|last=Bruce|first=Joan|date=4 May 2017|website=John Oxley Library blog, State Library of Queensland|access-date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is referenced in the title of the 1998 [[Momus (artist)|Momus]] album, ''[[The Little Red Songbook]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imomus.com/littlereviews.html Reviews: Alternative Press - December, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was discussed critically by [[Peter Hitchens]] in his book ''[[The Broken Compass: How British Politics Lost its Way]]'' (2009). It was the subject of a BBC Radio 4 documentary in 2008 presented and produced by [[Jolyon Jenkins]].&lt;ref name=BBCR4&gt;[[BBC Radio 4]] - In Living Memory - [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/inlivingmemory/pip/62r6s/ The Little Red Schoolbook] 18 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

An unexpurgated edition of the book, bar one minor cut, was published in the UK during July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Moorhead [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jul/08/the-little-red-schoolbook-republished-soren-hansen "The Little Red Schoolbook - honest about sex and the need to challenge authority"], ''The Guardian'', 8 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Piero della Francesca 042 Flagellation.jpg|thumb|upright=2.00|[[Piero della Francesca]], ''[[The Flagellation (Piero della Francesca)|The Flagellation of Christ]]''.]]
This article about '''the development of themes in Italian Renaissance painting''' is an extension to the article [[Italian Renaissance painting]], for which it provides additional pictures with commentary. The works encompassed are from [[Giotto]] in the early 14th century to [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|Last Judgement]]'' of the 1530s.

The themes that preoccupied painters of the Italian Renaissance were those of both subject matter and execution- what was painted and the style in which it was painted. The artist had far more freedom of both subject and style than did a [[Medieval]] painter. Certain characteristic elements of [[Renaissance]] painting evolved a great deal during the period. These include perspective, both in terms of how it was achieved and the effect to which it was applied, and realism, particularly in the depiction of humanity, either as symbolic, portrait or narrative element.

==Themes==
The ''[[The Flagellation (Piero della Francesca)|Flagellation of Christ]]'' by [[Piero della Francesca]] (above) demonstrates in a single small work many of the themes of Italian Renaissance painting, both in terms of compositional elements and subject matter. Immediately apparent is Piero's mastery of perspective and light. The architectural elements, including the tiled floor which becomes more complex around the central action, combine to create two spaces. The inner space is lit by an unseen light source to which Jesus looks. Its exact location can be pinpointed mathematically by an analysis of the diffusion and the angle of the shadows on the coffered ceiling. The three figures who are standing outside are lit from a different angle, from both daylight and light reflected from the pavement and buildings.

The religious theme is tied to the present. The ruler is a portrait of the visiting Emperor of [[Constantinople|Byzantium]].&lt;ref&gt;John VIII Palaeologus&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flagellation]] is also called "scourging". The term "scourge" was applied to the [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. Outside stand three men representing those who buried the body of Christ. The two older, [[Nicodemus]] and [[Joseph of Arimathaea]], are believed to be portraits of men who recently lost their sons, one of them to plague. The third man is the young disciple [[St. John the Evangelist|John]], and is perhaps a portrait of one of the sons, or else represents both of them in a single idealised figure, coinciding with the manner in which Piero painted angels.

==Elements of Renaissance painting==
Renaissance painting differed from the painting of the Late Medieval period in its emphasis upon the close observation of nature, particularly with regards to human anatomy, and the application of scientific principles to the use of perspective and light.
&lt;!---NOTE RE FORMAT: These galleries are carefully arranged in a 4 per row format. This has been done in order to facilitate comaparisons between adjacent paintings, both horizontally and vertically. In other words, they are laid out with the same care as the curator empoys in a realworld gallery exhibition. Please do not return them to the "single row" format, as it is counterproductive to this particular article.---&gt;

===Linear perspective===
The pictures in the gallery below show the development of linear perspective in buildings and cityscapes. 
* In [[Giotto]]'s fresco, the building is like a stage set with one side open to the viewer.
* In [[Paolo Uccello]]'s fresco, the townscape gives an impression of depth.
* [[Masaccio]]'s ''[[holy Trinity (Masaccio)|Holy Trinity]]'' was painted with carefully calculated mathematical proportions, in which he was probably assisted by the architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]].
* [[Fra Angelico]] uses the simple motif of a small [[loggia]] accurately drafted to create an intimate space.
* [[Gentile Bellini]] has painted a vast space, the [[Piazza San Marco]] in [[Venice]], in which the receding figures add to the sense of perspective.
* [[Leonardo da Vinci]] did detailed and measured drawings of the background Classical ruins preparatory to commencing the unfinished ''Adoration of the Magi''.
* [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] created an exceptionally complex and expansive setting on three levels, including a steeply descending ramp and a jutting wall. Elements of the landscape, such as the church on the right, are viewed partly through other structures.
* [[Raphael]]'s design for ''Fire in the Borgo'' shows buildings around a small square in which the background events are highlighted by the perspective.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Landscape===
The depiction of landscape was encouraged by the development of linear perspective and the inclusion of detailed landscapes in the background of many [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s of the 15th century. Also through this influence came an awareness of [[atmospheric perspective]] and the observation of the way distant things are affected by light. 
* Giotto uses a few rocks to give the impression of a mountain setting.
* Paolo Uccello has created a detailed and surreal setting as a stage for many small scenes.
* In [[Vittore Carpaccio|Carpaccio]]'s ''Deposition of the Body of Christ'', the desolate rocky landscape echoes the tragedy of the scene.
* [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s landscape has a sculptural, three-dimensional quality that is suggestive of a real physical space. The details of the rocks, their strata and fractures, suggest that he studied the [[geology|geological]] formations of the red [[limestone]] prevalent in areas of Northern Italy.
* [[Antonello da Messina]] sets the grim scene of the ''[[Crucifixion (Antonello da Messina)|Crucifixion]]'' in contrast to the placid countryside which rolls into the far distance, becoming paler and bluer as it recedes.
* [[Giovanni Bellini]] has created a detailed landscape with a pastoral scene between the foreground and background mountains. There are numerous levels in this landscape, making it the equivalent of Ghirlandaio's complex cityscape (above).
* [[Perugino]] has set the ''Adoration of the Magi'' against the familiar hilly landscape of [[Umbria]].
* Leonardo da Vinci, displays a theatrical use of [[atmospheric perspective]] in his view of the precipitous mountains around [[Lago di Garda]] at the foothills of the [[Alps]] in Northern Italy.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Light===
Light and shade exist in a painting in two forms. Tone is simply the lightness and darkness of areas of a picture, graded from white to black. Tonal arrangement is a very significant feature of some paintings. [[Chiaroscuro]] is the modelling of apparent surfaces within a picture by the suggestion of light and shadow. While tone was an important feature of paintings of the Medieval period, chiaroscuro was not. It became increasingly important to painters of the 15th century, transforming the depiction of three-dimensional space.
* [[Taddeo Gaddi]]'s ''Annunciation to the Shepherds'' is the first known large painting of a night scene. The internal light source of the picture is the angel.
* In [[Fra Angelico]]'s painting, daylight, which appears to come from the actual window of the friary cell which this fresco adorns, gently illuminates the figures and defines the architecture.
* In his [[Histories of the True Cross|''Emperor's Dream'']], [[Piero della Francesca]] takes up the theme of the night scene illuminated by an angel and applies his scientific knowledge of the diffusion of light. The tonal pattern thus created is a significant element in the composition of the painting.
* In his ''[[Agony in the Garden (Bellini)|Agony in the Garden]]'', [[Giovanni Bellini]] uses the fading sunset on a cloudy evening to create an atmosphere of tension and impending tragedy.
* In [[Domenico Veneziano]]'s formal portrait, the use of chiaroscuro to model the form is slight. However, the painting relies strongly on the tonal contrasts of the pale face, mid-tone background and dark garment with patterned bodice for effect.
* [[Botticelli]] uses chiaroscuro to model the face of the sitter and define the details of his simple garment. The light and shadow on the edge of the window define the angle of the light.
* The suggested authorship of this early-16th-century portrait {{Clarify |reason=Unclear which painting; refer to by name|date=October 2018}} includes [[Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio]], [[Mariotto Albertinelli]] and [[Giuliano Bugiardini]]. The painting combines many of the lighting effects of the other works in this gallery. The form is modelled by the light and shade, as if by a setting sun, which gives an element of drama, enhanced by the landscape. The tonal pattern created by the dark garment, the white linen and position of the hand is a compositional feature of the painting.
* In [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|John the Baptist]]'', elements of the painting, including the corners of the model's eyes and mouth, are disguised by shadow, creating an air of ambiguity and mystery.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Anatomy===
While remaining largely dependent upon topographic observation, the knowledge of anatomy was advanced by Leonardo da Vinci's meticulous dissection of 30 corpses. Leonardo, among others, impressed upon students the necessity of the close observation of life and made the drawing of live models an essential part of a student's formal study of the art of painting. 
* [[Cimabue]]'s ''[[Crucifix (Cimabue, Santa Croce)|Crucifixion]]'', extensively destroyed by flood in 1966, shows the formal arrangement, with curving body and drooping head that was prevalent in late Medieval art. The anatomy is strongly stylised to conform with traditional iconic formula.
* [[Giotto]] abandoned the traditional formula and painted from observation.
* [[Massacio]]'s figure of Christ is foreshortened as if viewed from below, and shows the upper torso strained as if with the effort of breathing.
* In [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s ''Deposition'' the artist, while not attempting to suggest the brutal realities of the crucifixion, has attempted to give the impression of death.
* In [[Piero della Francesca]]'s ''Baptism'', the robust figure of Jesus is painted with a simplicity and lack of sharply defined muscularity that belies its naturalism.
* The figure of Jesus in this painting, which is the combined work of [[Verrocchio]] and the young Leonardo, has in all probability been drafted by Verrocchio. The contours retain the somewhat contorted linearity of Gothic art. Much of the torso, however, is thought to have been painted by Leonardo and reveals a strong knowledge of anatomical form.
* Leonardo's picture of St. Jerome shows the results of detailed study of the shoulder girdle, known from a page of drawings.
* [[Michelangelo]] used human anatomy to great expressive effect. He was renowned for his ability in the creation of expressive poses and was imitated by many other painters and sculptors.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Realism===
The observation of nature meant that set forms and symbolic gestures which in Medieval art, and particularly the Byzantine style prevalent in much of Italy, were used to convey meaning, were replaced by the representation of human emotion as displayed by a range of individuals. 
*In this ''Resurrection'', [[Giotto]] shows the sleeping soldiers with faces hidden by helmets or foreshortened to emphasise the relaxed posture.
*In contrast, [[Andrea Castagno]] has painted a life-sized image of the condotierre, Pippo Spano, alert and with his feet over the edge of the painted niche which frames him.
*[[Filippo Lippi]] in this early work shows a very naturalistic group of children crowding around the Virgin Mary, but looking with innocent curiosity at the viewer. One of the children has [[Down syndrome]].
* [[Masaccio]] depicts the grief resulting from loss of innocence as [[Adam and Eve]] are expelled from the presence of God.
* [[Antonello da Messina]] painted several versions of ''[[Ecce Homo (Antonello da Messina)|Ecce Homo]]'', the tormented Christ as he was presented to the people by the Roman Governor. Such paintings usually show Christ in a tragic but heroic role, minimising the depiction of suffering. Antonello's depictions are starkly realistic.
* In his ''[[Dead Christ (Mantegna)|Lamentation over the Dead christ]]'', [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] has here depicted the dead body of Jesus with daring foreshortening, as if the viewer were standing at the end of the slab.
* In this detail from a larger painting, Mantegna shows a little child, wearing a tummy-binder and holey slippers, turning away and chewing its fingers while the infant Christ is circumcised.
* [[Giorgione]] paints a natural and unglamorised portrait of an old woman, unusual in its depiction of her illkempt hair and open mouth with crooked teeth.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Figure composition===
Among the preoccupations of artists commissioned to do large works with multiple figures were how to make the subject, usually narrative, easily read by the viewer, natural in appearance and well composed within the picture space. 
* [[Giotto]] combines three separate narrative elements into this dramatic scene set against the dehumanising helmets of the guards. [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] betrays [[Jesus]] to the soldiers by kissing him. The High Priest signals to a guard to seize him. Peter slices the ear off the high priest's servant as he steps forward to lay hands on Jesus. Five figures dominate the foreground, surrounding Jesus so that only his head is visible. Yet by skillful arrangement of color and the gestures of the men, Giotto makes the face of Jesus the focal point of the painting.
* In ''The Death of Adam'', [[Piero della Francesca]] has set the dying patriarch so that he is cast into relief against the black garment worn by one of his family. His importance to the story is further emphasised by the arch of figures formed around him and the diagonals of the arms which all lead to his head. p
* ''The Resurrection of the Son of Theophilus'' is a remarkably cohesive whole, considering that it was begun by [[Masaccio]], left unfinished, vandalised, and eventually completed by [[Filippino Lippi]]. Masaccio painted the central section.
* [[Pollaiuolo]], in this highly systemised painting, has taken the [[cross-bow]] used by the archers in the foreground, as the compositional structure. Within this large triangular shape, divided vertically, he has alternated the figures between front and back views.
* [[Botticelli]]'s long, narrow painting of ''[[Venus and Mars (Botticelli)|Mars and Venus]]'' is based on a W with the figures mirroring each other. The lovers, who shortly before were united, are now separated by sleep. The three small fawns who process across the painting hold the composition together.
* [[Michelangelo]]s mastery of complex figure composition, as in his ''[[Deposition (Michelangelo)|The Entombment]]'' was to inspire many artists for centuries. In this panel painting the figure of Christ, though vertical, is slumped and a dead weight at the centre of the picture, while those who try to carry the body lean outwards to support it.
* At first glance, [[Signorelli]]'s ''Fall of the Damned'' is an appalling and violent jumble of bodies, but by the skilful placement of the figures so that the lines, rather than intersecting, flow in an undulating course through the picture, the composition is both unified and resolved into a large number of separate actions. The colours of the devils also serve to divide the picture into the tormentors and the tormented.
* ''The Battle of Ostia'' was executed by [[Raphael]]'s assistants, probably to his design. The foreground of the painting is organised into two overlapping arched shapes, the larger showing captives being subdued, while to the left and slightly behind, they are forced to kneel before the Pope. While the Pope rises above the second group and dominates it, the first group is dominated by a soldier whose colour and splendid headdress acts like a visual stepping stone to the Pope. At the edges of this group two stooping figures mirror each other, creating a tension in which one pushes away from the edge of the painting and the other pulls upward at its centre.

==Major works==

===Altarpieces===
Through the Renaissance period, the large [[altarpiece]] had a unique status as a commission.  An altarpiece was destined to become a focal point, not only visually in the religious building it occupied, but also in the devotions of the worshippers. [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''Madonna of the Rocks'', now in the [[National Gallery, London]] but previously in a chapel in [[Milan]], is one of many images that was used in the petitioning of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] against plague. The significance of these images to those who commissioned them, who worshipped in their location, and who created them is lost when they are viewed in an art gallery.

* The two ''Enthroned Madonnas'' by [[Cimabue]] and [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]] demonstrate the variations on a theme that was formalised and constrained by tradition. Although the positions of the Madonna and Child are very similar, the artists have treated most of the features differently. Cimabue's throne is front-on and uses perspective to suggest its solidity. The angels, their faces, wings and haloes, are arranged to form a rich pattern. The gold leaf detailing of the Madonna's garment picks out the folds in a delicate network. The Child sits regally, with his feet set at the same angle as his mother's.
* In Duccio's ''[[Rucellai Madonna]]'', the largest of its kind at 4.5 metres high, the throne is set diagonally and the Child, much more of a baby despite his gesture, sits diagonally opposed to his mother. While the positioning of the kneeling angels is quite simplistic, they have a naturalism in their repeated postures and are varied by the beautiful colour combinations of their robes. On the Madonna's robe the gold border makes a meandering line, defining the form and contours, and enlivening the whole composition with a single decorative detail.
* [[Giotto]]'s ''[[Ognissanti Madonna]]'' is now housed in the same room of the [[Uffizi]] as Cimabue's and Duccio's, where the advances that he made in both drawing from the observation of nature, and in his use of perspective can be easily compared with the earlier masters. While the painting conforms to the model of an altarpiece, the figures within it do not follow the traditional formula. The Madonna and Child are solidly three-dimensional. This quality is enhanced by the canopied throne which contributes the main decorative element, while gold borders are minimised. The angels, which mirror each other, each have quite individual drapery.
* A hundred years later, [[Masaccio]], still within the constraints of the formal altarpiece, confidently creates a three-dimensional figure draped in heavy robes, her chubby Christ Child sucking on his fingers. The lutes played by the little angels are both steeply foreshortened.
* In [[Fra Angelico]]'s painting the figures lack the emphasis on mass of Masaccio's. Angelico was renowned for his delicacy in depicting the Madonna. The appeal of such paintings is demonstrated in the way the adoring angels are clustered around. As in Masaccio's painting, the Madonna's halo is decorated with [[pseudo-kufic]] script, probably to suggest her [[Middle Eastern]] origin.
* In the hands of [[Piero della Francesca]] the formal gold frame is transformed into a classical niche, drawn in perfect linear perspective and defined by daylight. The assorted saints cluster round in a natural way, while the Madonna sits on a realistic throne on a small podium covered by an [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|oriental carpet]], while the donor [[Federico da Montefeltro]] kneels at her feet. A concession to tradition is that the Madonna is of a larger scale than the other figures.
* In [[Giovanni Bellini|Bellini]]'s painting, while on one hand, the figures and the setting give the effect of great realism, Bellini's interest in Byzantine icons is displayed in the hierarchical enthronement and demeanour of the Madonna.
* The [[Milan]]ese painter [[Bergognone]] has drawn on aspects of the work of [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and Bellini to create this painting in which the red robe and golden hair of Catherine of Alexandria are effectively balanced by the contrasting black and white of Catherine of Siena, and framed by a rustic arch of broken bricks.
* In [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[Madonna della Vittoria]]'', the Madonna may occupy the central position, framed in her garlanded gazebo, but the focus of attention is [[Francesco II Gonzaga]] whose achievements are acknowledged not only by the Madonna and Christ Child but by the heroic saints, Michael and George.
* [[Leonardo da Vinci]] abandoned any sort of formal canopy and surrounded the Madonna and Child with the grandeur of nature into which he set the figures in a carefully balanced yet seemingly informal trapezoid composition.
* The ''[[Sistine Madonna]]'' by [[Raphael]] uses the formula not of an altarpiece but the formal portrait, with a frame of green curtains through which a vision can be seen, witnessed by [[Pope Sixtus II]] for whom the work is named. The clouds around the Virgin are composed of cherubic faces, while the two iconic cherubs so beloved with the late 20th century fashion for angels, prop themselves on the sill. This work became the model for [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] and many other painters.
* [[Andrea del Sarto]], while using figures to a very natural and lifelike effect, abandons in the ''Madonna of the Harpies'' practical reality by setting the Madonna on a Classical plinth as if she were a statue. Every figure is in a state of instability, marked by the forward thrust of the Madonna's knee against which she balances a book. This painting is showing the trends that were to be developed in [[Mannerism|Mannerist painting]].

===Fresco cycles===
The largest, most time-consuming paid work that an artist could do was a scheme of [[fresco]]es for a church, private palace or commune building. Of these, the largest unified scheme in Italy which remains more-or-less intact is that created by a number of different artists at the end of the Medieval period at the [[Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi]]. It was followed by [[Giotto]]'s Proto-Renaissance scheme at Padua and many others ranging from [[Benozzo Gozzoli]]'s [[Magi Chapel]] for the [[Medici]] to [[Michelangelo]]'s supreme accomplishment for [[Pope Julius II]] at the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling|Sistine Chapel]]. 
* [[Giotto]] painted the large, free-standing [[Scrovegni Chapel]] in [[Padua]] with the '' [[Life of the Virgin]]'' and the ''[[Life of Christ]]''. Breaking from medieval tradition, it set a standard of naturalism.
* The two large frescoes of ''Allegories of Good and Bad Government'' painted by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] for the Commune of Siena are completely secular and show detailed views of a townscape with citizens, emphasising the importance of civic order.
* By contrast, [[Andrea di Bonaiuto]], painting for the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s at the new church of [[Santa Maria Novella]], completed a huge fresco of ''the Triumph of the Church'', which shows the role of the church in the work of [[Salvation]], and in particular, the role of the Dominicans, who also appear symbolically as ''the Hounds of Heaven'', shepherding the people of God. The painting includes a view of [[Florence Cathedral]].
* [[Masaccio]] and [[Masolino]] collaborated on the [[Brancacci Chapel]] fresco cycle which is most famous for Masaccio's lifelike innovations, Masolino's more elegant style is seen in this townscape which skillfully combines two episodes of ''the Life of St. Peter''.
* [[Piero della Francesca]]'s fresco cycle in the church of [[San Francesco, Arezzo]], closely follows the Legend of the True Cross as written by [[Jacopo da Varagine]] in the '' [[Golden Legend]]''. The pictures reveal his studies of light and perspective, and the figures have an almost monolithic solidity.
* [[Benozzo Gozzoli]]'s [[Magi Chapel|fresco cycle for the private chapel]] of the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi|Medici Palace]] is a late work in the [[International Gothic]] style, a fanciful and richly ornamental depiction of the Medici with their entourage as the [[Three Wise Men]].
* The elaborate cycle for the [[House of Este]]'s [[Palazzo Schifanoia]] at Ferrara, executed in part by [[Francesco del Cossa]], was also fanciful in its depictions of Classical deities and Zodial signs which are combined with scenes of the life of the family.
* [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s paintings for the Gonzaga also show family life but have a preponderance of highly realistic elements and skillfully utilise the real architecture of the room they decorate, the mantelpiece forming a plinth for the figures and the real ceiling pendentives being apparently supported on painted pilasters.
* While in the Brancacci Chapel, historians seek to identify the faces of Masaccio, Masolino and perhaps Donatello among the apostles, [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] at the [[Sassetti Chapel]] makes no attempt to disguise his models. Each fresco in this religious cycle has two sets of figures: those who tell the story and those who are witness to it. In this scene of ''the Birth of the Virgin Mary'', a number of the noble women of Florence have come in, as if to congratulate the new mother.
* ''[[The Punishment of the Sons of Korah]]'' by [[Botticelli]] is one of episodes the ''Life of Moses'' series, which, together with ''The Life of Christ'', was commissioned in the 1480s as decoration to the [[Sistine Chapel]]. The artists [[Perugino]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Cosimo Rosselli]] all worked on the carefully designed and harmonious scheme.
* [[Michelangelo]]'s painting of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, which he executed alone over a period of five years, with narratives from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], prophetic figures and the Ancestors of Christ, was destined to become one of the most famous artworks in the world.
* Simultaneously, [[Raphael]] and a number of his assistants painted the papal chambers known as ''[[Raphael Rooms]]''. In ''[[The School of Athens]]'' Raphael depicts famous people of his day, including Leonardo, Michelangelo, Bramante and himself, as philosophers of ancient Athens.

==Subjects==
Devotional images of the ''[[Madonna and Child]]'' were produced in very large numbers, often for private clients. Scenes of ''the Life of Christ'', the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'',  or ''Lives of the Saints'' were also made in large numbers for churches, particularly scenes associated with the ''[[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]]'' and ''the Passion of Christ''. ''The Last Supper'' was commonly depicted in religious refectories.

During the Renaissance an increasing number of patrons had their likeness committed to posterity in paint. For this reason there exists a great number of Renaissance portraits for whom the name of the sitter is unknown. Wealthy private patrons commissioned artworks as decoration for their homes, of increasingly secular subject matter.

===Devotional paintings===

====The Madonna====
These small intimate pictures, which are now nearly all in museums, were most often done for private ownership, but might occasionally grace a small altar in a chapel.

* ''The Madonna adoring the Christ Child with two Angels'' has always been particularly popular on account of the expressive little boy angel supporting the Christ Child. Paintings of [[Filippo Lippi]]'s such as this were to particularly influence [[Botticelli]].
* [[Verrocchio]] separates the Madonna and Christ Child from the viewer by a stone sill, also used in many portraits. The rose and the cherries represent spiritual love and sacrificial love.
* [[Antonello da Messina]]'s ''Madonna and Child'' is superficially very like that of Verrocchio, but it is much less formal and both the mother and the child appear to be moving rather than posing for the painter. The foreshortened elbow of the Child as he reaches for his mother's breast occurs in Raphael's work and can be seen in a different form in Michelangelo's ''Doni Tondo''.
* The figures placed at opposing diagonals seen in this early ''Madonna and Child'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was a compositional theme that was to recur in many of his works and be imitated by his pupils and by Raphael.
* [[Giovanni Bellini]] was influenced by [[Greek Orthodox]] [[icon]]s. The gold cloth in this painting takes the place of the gold leaf background. The arrangement is formal, yet the gestures, and in particular the mother's adoring gaze, give a human warmth to this picture.
* [[Vittore Carpaccio]]'s ''Madonna and Child'' is very unusual in showing the Christ Child as a toddler fully dressed in contemporary clothing. The meticulous detail and domesticity are suggestive of [[Early Netherlandish painting]].
* [[Michelangelo]]'s Doni Tondo is the largest of these works, but was a private commission. The highly unusual composition, the contorted form of the Madonna, the three heads all near the top of the painting and the radical foreshortening were all very challenging features, and Agnolo Doni was not sure that he wished to pay for it.
* [[Raphael]] has skillfully set opposing forces into play, and united the Madonna and Child with a loving gaze.

===Secular paintings===

====Portraits====
During the latter half of the 15th century, there was a proliferation of portraits. Although the subjects of some of them were later remembered for their achievements or their noble lineage, the identities of many have been lost and that of even the most famous portrait of all time, [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', is open to speculation and controversy.

* The advantage of a profile portrait such as [[Piero della Francesca]]'s ''[[Portrait of Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta]]'' is that it identifies the subject like a facial signature. The proportions of the face, the respective angles of the forehead, nose and brow, the position and shape of the eye and the set of the jaw remain recognisable through life. Moreover, once a profile likeness has been taken, it can be used to cast a medal or sculpt an image in relief.
* [[Pollaiuolo]] has conformed to the formula, emphasising this young woman's profile with a fine line which also defines the delicate shape of her nostrils and the corners of her mouth. But he has added a three-dimensional quality by the subtle use of [[chiaroscuro]] and the treatment of the rich Florentine brocade of her sleeve.
* [[Alesso Baldovinetti]], on the other hand, has used the profile of this strong-featured girl to create a striking pattern of a highlighted contour against the darker background. The background is a lively shape adding to the compositional structure of the painting. The little black fillet on her forehead responds to the dynamic pattern of the embroidered sleeve.
* [[Botticelli]]'s portrait, although turned to three-quarter view with strong tonal modelling, has much to do with Baldovinetti's painting in its striking arrangement of shapes in the red garment, the hat and the dark hair and the pattern that they form against the background.
* [[Antonello da Messina]]'s portrait, some years earlier than Botticelli's, bears it a passing similarity. But this painting does not rely heavily on the skilful arrangement of clearly contoured shapes. Antonello has used the advantages of oil paint, as against Botticelli's [[tempera]], to achieve a subtle and detailed likeness in which the bushy eyebrows, the imperfections of the skin and the shadow of the beard have been rendered with photographic precision.
* [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]]'s tempera portrait of [[An Old Man and his Grandson|an old man with his grandson]] combines the meticulous depiction of the old man's enlarged nose and parchment-like skin with a tenderness usually reserved for portrayals of ''The Madonna and Child''. Ghirlandaio takes this analogy further by setting the scene against a window and landscape.
* [[Pintoricchio]]'s portrait of a boy sets him high in the picture frame, reducing his scale in proportion to the area in contrast to the usual way of showing adults. The painting is set against a landscape such as used by Leonardo and Bellini. Pinturicchio's main fame lay in his skillfully characterised portraits like this.
* In the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' Leonardo employed the technique of ''sfumato'', delicately graded chiaroscuro that models the surface contours, while allowing details to disappear in the shadows. The technique gives an air of mystery to this painting which has brought it lasting fame. The beautiful hands become almost a decorative element.
* [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s portrait of the elected Duke of Venice has an official air and could hardly be more formal. Yet the face is characterised with what one might hope for in the Doge, wisdom, humour and decisiveness. Although a more elaborate painting, it has much in common with Baldovinetti's sense of design.
* The subject of [[Titian]]'s portrait is unknown, and its considerable fame rests solely on its beauty and unusual composition in which the face is supported and balanced by the large blue sleeve of quilted satin. The sleeve is almost the same colour as the background; its rich tonality gives it form. The white linen of the shirt enlivens the composition, while the man's eyes pick up the colour of the sleeve with penetrating luminosity.
* Superficially, [[Andrea del Sarto]]'s portrait has many of the same elements as Titian's. But it is handled very differently, being much broader in treatment, and less compelling in subject. The painting has achieved an imediacy, as if the sitter has paused for a moment and is about to return to what he is doing.
* [[Raphael]], in this much-copied portrait of [[Pope Julius II]], set a standard for the painting of future popes. Unlike the contemporary portraits here by Bellini, Titian and del Sarto, Raphael has abandoned the placement of the figure behind a shelf or barrier and has shown the Pope as if seated in his own apartment. Against the green cloth decorated with the keys of [[St. Peter]], the red velvet papal garments make a rich contrast, the white beard being offset by the pleated white linen. On the uprights of the chair, the acorn finials are the symbol of the Pope's family, the ''[[della Rovere]]''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====The nude====
These four famous paintings demonstrate the advent and acceptance of the nude as a subject for the artist in its own right. 
* In [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|Birth of Venus]]'', the nude figure, although central to the painting, is not of itself the subject. The subject of the painting is a story from [[Classical mythology]]. The fact that the Goddess Venus rose naked from the sea provides justification for the nude study that dominates the centre of the work.
* Painted thirty years later, the exact meaning of [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s picture is unclear. Had the subject been painted by an [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painter, it would be quite unnecessary to ascribe a meaning. But in this Renaissance work, there is the presence of a mirror, an object that is usually symbolic and which suggests an allegory. The young lady's nakedness is a sign not so much of seduction, as innocence and vulnerability. However, she decks herself out in an extremely rich headdress, stitched with pearls, and having not one, but two mirrors, sees only herself reflected endlessly. The mirror, often a symbol of prophecy, here becomes an object of vanity, with the young woman in the role of [[narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]].
* [[Giorgione]]'s painting possibly predates Bellini's by ten years. It has always been known as ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|The Sleeping Venus]]'' but there is nothing in the painting to confirm that it is, indeed, Venus. The painting is remarkable for its lack of symbolism and the emphasis on the body simply as an object of beauty. It is believed to have been completed by Titian.
* [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus of Urbino]]'', on the other hand, was painted for the pleasure of the Duke of Urbino, and as in Botticelli's ''Birth of Venus'', painted for a member of the Medici family, the model looks directly at the viewer. The model may very well have been the mistress of the client. Venus of Urbino is not simply a body beautiful in its own right. She is an individual and highly seductive young woman, who is not in the nude state indicative of heavenly perfection, but is simply naked, having taken off her clothes but left on some of her jewellery.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Classical mythology====
Paintings of classical mythology were invariably done for the important salons in the houses of private patrons. Botticelli's most famous works are for the Medici, Raphael painted ''Galatea'' for Agostino Chigi and Bellini's ''[[Feast of the Gods (Bellini)|Feast of the Gods]]'' was, with several works by Titian, in the home of [[Alfonso I d'Este]]

* [[Pollaiuolo]]'s ''Hercules and the Hydra'' typifies many paintings of mythological subjects which lent themselves to interpretation that was both Humanist and Christian. In this work good overcomes evil, and courage is glorified. The figure of Hercules has resonances with the Biblical character of [[Samson]] who also was renowned for his strength and slew a lion.
* In [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[Pallas and the Centaur]]'', Wisdom,&lt;!---don't delete this capital---&gt; personified by Athena, leads the cowering Centaur by the forelock, so learning and refinement are able to overcome brute instinct, which is the characteristic symbolised by the centaur.
* [[Raphael]]'s ''[[Galatea (Raphael)|Galatea]]'', though Classical in origin, has a specifically Christian resonance that would have been recognised by those who were familiar with the story. It is about the nature of love. While all around her aspire to earthly love and succumb to the arrows shot by the trio of cupids, Galatea has chosen spiritual love and turns her eyes to Heaven.
* Three large works remain that were painted for a single room for the Este by [[Filippo Bellini|Bellini]] and his successor [[Titian]]. Of these, Titian's ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' represents a moment in a narrative. The other two paintings are jolly drinking scenes with a number of narrative elements introduced in a minor way, in order that characters might be identifiable. This painting does not appear to have any higher allegorical sentiment attached to it. It appears to be simply a very naturalistic portrayal of a number of the ancient gods and their associates, eating, drinking and enjoying the party.
