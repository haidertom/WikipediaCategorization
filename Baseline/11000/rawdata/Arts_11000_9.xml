'''Afrofuturism''' is a cultural [[aesthetic]], philosophy of science, and philosophy of history that explores the developing intersection of African/African Diaspora culture with technology. It combines elements of [[science fiction]], [[historical fiction]], [[fantasy]], [[Afrocentrism]] and [[magic realism]] with non-Western [[Cosmology|cosmologies]] in order to critique the present-day dilemmas of [[black people]] and to interrogate and re-examine historical events. It was coined by Mark Dery in 1994 and explored in the late 1990s through conversations led by [[Alondra Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Rambsy II| first = Howard| title = A Notebook on Afrofuturism| work = Cultural Front| accessdate = 2014-03-26| date = 2012-04-14| url = http://www.culturalfront.org/2012/04/notebook-on-afrofuturism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afrofuturism addresses themes and concerns of the [[African diaspora]] through a [[technoculture]] and [[science fiction]] lens, encompassing a range of media and artists with a shared interest in envisioning black futures that stem from Afrodiasporic experiences.&lt;ref name="history-future"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yaszek|first=Lisa|title=Afrofuturism, science fiction, and the history of the future|url=http://sdonline.org/42/afrofuturism-science-fiction-and-the-history-of-the-future/|journal=Socialism and Democracy|date=November 2006|volume=20|issue=3|pages=41–60|doi=10.1080/08854300600950236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seminal Afrofuturistic works include the novels of [[Samuel R.

==History==
===Mid-late 20th century development===
Despite Afrofuturism being coined in 1993, scholars tend to agree that Afrofuturistic music, art and text became more common and widespread in the late 1950s. The Afrofuturist approach to music was first propounded by [[Sun Ra]]. Born in Alabama, Sun Ra's music coalesced in Chicago in the mid-1950s, when with the Arkestra he began recording music that drew from [[hard bop]] and modal sources, creating a new synthesis that used [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and space-themed titles to reflect Ra's linkage of ancient African culture, specifically [[Afrocentrism#Egypt and the argument of African cultural unity|Egypt]], and the cutting edge of the [[Space Age]]. For many years, Ra and his bandmates lived, worked and performed in Philadelphia while touring festivals worldwide. Ra's film ''[[Space Is the Place]]'' shows The Arkestra in Oakland in the mid-1970s in full space regalia, replete with science-fiction imagery as well as other comedic and musical material. As of 2018, the band was still composing and performing, under the leadership of [[Marshall Allen]]. 

Afrofuturist ideas were taken up in 1975 by [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and his bands [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] and [[Funkadelic]] with his magnum opus ''[[Mothership Connection]]'' and the subsequent ''[[The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein]]'', [[P-Funk Earth Tour]], ''[[Funkentelechy Vs. the Placebo Syndrome]]'', and ''[[Motor Booty Affair]]''. In the thematic underpinnings to [[P-Funk mythology]] ("pure cloned funk"), Clinton in his alter ego ''Starchild'' spoke of "certified Afronauts, capable of funkitizing galaxies".

Other musicians typically regarded as working in or greatly influenced by the Afrofuturist tradition include reggae producers [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]] and [[Scientist (musician)|Scientist]], hip-hop artists [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]], electronic musicians [[Larry Heard]], [[A Guy Called Gerald]], [[Juan Atkins]], [[Jeff Mills]],&lt;ref name=reddell&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reddell |first=Trace|year=2013 |title=Ethnoforgery and Outsider Afrofuturism |url=https://dj.dancecult.net/index.php/dancecult/article/view/376/392 |journal=Dancecult |publisher=[[Griffith University]] ePress |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=89–90 |doi=10.12801/1947-5403.2013.05.02.05 |accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Newcleus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/forever-out-there-25-contributors-to-the-space-disco-era-1976-1986/P2/ |title=Forever Out There: 25 Contributors to the Space Disco Era 1976–1986 |last1=Loudermilk |first1=A. |date=3 October 2016 |website=[[PopMatters]] |access-date=23 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lotti Golden]] &amp; Richard Scher, electro hip hop producer/writers of [[Warp 9]]'s "[[Light Years Away (Warp 9 song)|Light Years Away]]", a sci-fi tale of ancient alien visitation, described as a "cornerstone of early 80's beatbox afrofuturism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Rob |title=The 101 strangest records on Spotify: Warp 9 – It's A Beat Wave |date=May 14, 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/14/the-101-strangest-records-on-spotify-warp-9-its-a-beat-wave |work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural criticism in the 1990s===
In the early 1990s, a number of [[cultural critic]]s, notably [[Mark Dery]] in his 1994 essay "Black to the Future", began to write about the features they saw as common in African-American science fiction, music, and art. Dery dubbed this phenomenon "Afrofuturism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dery|first=Mark|date=1994|title=Black to the Future: Interviews with Samuel R. Delany, Greg Tate, and Tricia Rose|url=https://www.kit.ntnu.no/sites/www.kit.ntnu.no/files/Black%20to%20the%20Future%20(Dery)_0.pdf|journal=Flame Wars: The Discourse of Cyberculture|location=Durham, NC|publisher=Duke University Press|page=180|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to cultural critic [[Kodwo Eshun]], British journalist [[Mark Sinker]] was theorizing a form of Afrofuturism in the pages of ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'', a British music magazine, as early as 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sinker|first=Mark|date=February 1992|title=Black Science Fiction|url=http://www.exacteditions.com/read/the-wire/february-1992-(issue-96)-35378/30/2/|journal=The Wire|publisher=Exact Editions Ltd.|page=30|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afrofuturist ideas have further been expanded by scholars like [[Alondra Nelson]], [[Greg Tate]], [[Tricia Rose]], [[Kodwo Eshun]], and others.&lt;ref name=history-future /&gt; In an interview, Alondra Nelson explained Afrofuturism as a way of looking at the subject position of black people which covers themes of alienation and aspirations for a utopic future. The idea of "alien" or "other" is a theme often explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Alondra Nelson (Interviewee) | title = Afrofuturism |medium = Youtube | year = 2010 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFhEjaal5js}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Nelson notes that discussions around race, access, and technology often bolster uncritical claims about a so-called "[[digital divide]]".&lt;ref name="Nelson-Intro"&gt;{{Cite journal | issn = 1527-1951 | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 1–15 | last = Nelson | first = Alondra | title = Introduction: Future Texts | journal = Social Text: Special Issue on Afrofuturism | accessdate = 2014-03-16 | year = 2002 | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/social_text/v020/20.2nelson01.html | doi=10.1215/01642472-20-2_71-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital divide overemphasizes the association of racial and economic inequality with limited access to technology.  This association then begins to construct blackness "as always oppositional to technologically driven chronicles of progress".&lt;ref name=Nelson-Intro /&gt; As a critique of the neo-critical argument that the future's history-less identities will end burdensome stigma, Afrofuturism holds that history should remain a part of identity, particularly in terms of race.&lt;ref name=Nelson-Intro /&gt;

===21st century===

A new generation of recording artists have embraced Afrofuturism into their music and fashion, including [[Solange Knowles|Solange]], [[Rihanna]], and [[Beyoncé]]. This tradition continues from artists such as [[Erykah Badu]], [[Missy Elliott]] and [[Janelle Monáe]], who incorporated cyborg themes and metallics into their style.&lt;ref name="La Ferla"&gt;{{cite news|last1=La Ferla|first1=Ruth|title=Afrofuturism: The Next Generation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/fashion/afrofuturism-the-next-generation.html?_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 December 2016|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Other 21st century musicians who have been characterized as Afrofuturist include singer [[FKA Twigs]],&lt;ref name="La Ferla"/&gt; musical duo [[Ibeyi]],&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt; and DJ/producer [[Ras G]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/24/space-is-the-place-flying-lotus-janelle-monae-afrofuturism|title=Afrofuturism takes flight: from Sun Ra to Janelle Monáe|last=Bakare|first=Lanre|date=2014-07-24|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent years, artists such as Rihanna and Beyoncé have often been interpreted by the public as having some non-human elements about them, exhibited in both their performances, and in their day to day interactions. Because the tabloids have so much control over the way that information is digested, the public receives images of these women that are distant and controlled solely by the media, and thus, these women are often painted as angry or unfeeling. Scholars such as Robin James have interrogated and expanded upon the work of Kodwo Eshun, and coined the idea of the "robo-diva". These scholars both argue that the Black experience has always been more alien than it has been human, and James connects the mechanics of the middle passage to alien abduction through concepts of kidnapping, isolation, and bowing down to an unknown power. Kodwo Eshun also posits that perhaps the categorization of "human" has no use in the Black community, and that instead, the category of "robot" is not only more powerful, but more accurately representative of the positioning in the social hierarchy in which Black people exist in the present day. Because musical artists (Rihanna, Beyoncé) exhibit such non-human qualities, they are often ostracized for being "cold" or "mechanical". The white patriarchy both fears and admires such artists due to their unapologetic displays of female sexuality and its interactions with technology. These fears then propel the virgin/whore dichotomy that stems from the trope of the Jezebel, and serves to further the racialized projections of stereotypes onto Black females in the music industry.

[[Janelle Monáe]] has made a conscious effort to restore Afrofuturist cosmology to the forefront of urban contemporary music. Her notable works include the music videos "Prime Time"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=janellemonae|title=Janelle Monáe – PrimeTime ft. Miguel [Official Video]|date=2013-10-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oxls2xX0Clg|accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Many Moons",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHgbzNHVg0c|title=Janelle Monae - Many Moons [Official Short Film]|first=|last=Janelle Monáe|date=3 October 2008|publisher=|accessdate=21 April 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; which explore the realms of slavery and freedom through the world of cyborgs and the fashion industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ebony.com/entertainment-culture/black-alt-enter-afrofuturism-999#axzz2nJVuzcgO/|title= [BLACK ALT] What Is Afrofuturism?|last = Gonzales |first = Michael A.|date=1 October 2013|work=Ebony|accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Calveri | first = John | title = Janelle Monáe: A New Pioneer of Afrofuturism | work = The Quietus | accessdate = 2014-03-16 | date = 2010-09-02 | url = http://thequietus.com/articles/04889-janelle-mon-e-the-archandroid-afrofuturism}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is credited with proliferating Afrofuturist funk into a new Neo-Afrofuturism by use of her [[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]-inspired alter-ego, ''Cindi Mayweather,'' who incites a rebellion against the Great Divide, a secret society, in order to liberate citizens who have fallen under their oppression. This ArchAndroid role reflects earlier Afrofuturistic figures Sun Ra and George Clinton, who created their own visuals as extraterrestrial beings rescuing African-Americans from the oppressive natures of Earth. Her influences include ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', ''[[Blade Runner]]'', and ''[[Star Wars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Barrow | first = Jerry L. | title = Janelle Monae's Top 5 Sci-Fi Movies of All Time | work = The Urban Daily: Beats, Buzz, &amp; Lifestyle | accessdate = 2014-03-19 | date = 2009-04-14 | url = http://theurbandaily.com/2009/04/14/janelle-monaes-top-5-sci-fi-movies-of-all-time/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The all Black Wondaland Arts Collective Society, of which Monáe is a founder of, stated "We believe songs are spaceships.

Chicago is home to a vibrant community of artists exploring Afrofuturism. [[Nick Cave (performance artist)|Nick Cave]], known for his Soundsuits project, has helped develop younger talent as the director of the graduate fashion program at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]]. Other artists include visual artists Hebru Brantley as well as contemporary artist [[Rashid Johnson]], a Chicago native currently based in New York. In 2013, Chicago resident Ytasha L. Womack wrote the study ''Afrofuturism: The World of Black Science Fiction and Fantasy'', and William Hayashi has published all three volumes of his ''Darkside Trilogy''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedarksidetrilogy.com|title=(( The Dark Side Trilogy )) Book One : Discovery – by William Hayashi|website=www.thedarksidetrilogy.com|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; which tells the story of what happens in America when the country discovers African Americans secretly living on the backside of the moon since before the arrival of Neil Armstrong, an extreme vision of segregation imposed by technologically advanced Blacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Xlibris | isbn = 1441586946 | last = Hayashi | first = William | title = Discovery: Volume 1 of the Darkside Trilogy | date = 2009-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = XLIBRIS | isbn = 149310005X | last = Hayashi | first = William | title = Conception: Volume 2 of the Darkside Trilogy | date = 2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} [[Krista Franklin]], a member of University of Chicago's Arts Incubator, is currently exploring the relation between Afrofuturism and the grotesque through her visual and written work with weaves and collected hair. Recently, she also created an audio narrative in collaboration with another Afrofuturist, Perpetual Rebel, called ''The Two Thousand and Thirteen Narrative(s) of Naima Brown'', which explores the ideas of identity and transformation within the context of hair and African-American culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Hazel | first = Tempestt | title = Black to the Future Series: An Interview with Krista Franklin | work = The Chicago Arts Archive: A Sixty Inches from Center Project | accessdate = 2014-03-19 | date = 2012-05-28 | url = http://sixtyinchesfromcenter.org/archive/?p=15558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==

The creation of the term Afrofuturism in the 1990s was often primarily used to categorize "speculative fiction that treats African-American themes and addresses African-American concerns in the context of 20th-century technoculture,"&lt;ref name="Bould"&gt;Bould, Mark. "The Ships Landed Long Ago: Afrofuturism and Black SF." ''Science Fiction Studies'' 34.2 (July 2007): 177–186. {{JSTOR|4241520}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was soon expanded to include artistic, scientific, and spiritual practices throughout the [[African diaspora]]. Contemporary practice retroactively identifies and documents historical instances of Afrofuturist practice and integrates them into the canon. For example, the [[Dark Matter (series)|Dark Matter]] anthologies edited by [[Sheree Thomas]] feature contemporary [[Black science fiction]], discuss Ralph Ellison's [[Invisible Man]] in her introduction, "Looking for the Invisible," and also include older works by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Charles W. Chesnutt]], and [[George S. Schuyler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Sheree|authorlink=Sheree Thomas |editor-first=Sheree |editor-last=Thomas |title=Dark Matter: A Century of Speculative Fiction from the African Diaspora |year=2000|publisher=Warner Aspect |isbn=0446525839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lisa Yazsek argues that [[Ralph Ellison]]'s 1952 novel, ''[[Invisible Man]]'', should be thought of as a predecessor to Afrofuturist literature. Yaszek illustrates that Ellison draws upon Afrofuturist ideas that were not yet prevalent in African-American literature. Ellison critiques the traditional visions of black people's future in the United States, but does not provide readers a different future to imagine. Yaszek believes that Ellison does not offer any other futures so that the next generation of authors can. ''Invisible Man'' may not be Afrofuturist in the sense that it does not provide a better – or even any –  future for black people in the United States, but it can be thought of as a call for people to start thinking and creating art with an Afrofuturist mindset. In this sense, Yaszek concludes that Ellison's novel is a canon in Afrofuturistic literature by serving as call for "this kind of future-historical art" to those who succeed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yaszek|first=Lisa|year=2005|title=An Afrofuturist Reading of Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man|url=http://www.wright.edu/~david.wilson/eng2050/afrofuturistreading.pdf|journal=Rethinking History|volume=9|issue=2–3|pages=297–313|doi=10.1080/13642520500149202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of contemporary [[Black science fiction]] and speculative fiction authors have also been characterized as Afrofuturist or as employing Afrofuturist themes. [[Nnedi Okorafor]] has been labeled this way, both for her [[Hugo Award for Best Novella|Hugo Award]]-winning [[Binti (novel)|Binti]] novella series,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/25/14384030/nnedi-okorafor-binti-home-afrofuturist-science-fiction-review|title=The Binti novellas are fun, bite-sized stories of interstellar Afrofuturism|date=2017-01-25|website=The Verge|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for her novel ''[[Who Fears Death]]''.&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/your-far-out-guide-to-afrofuturism-and-black-magic_us_5711403fe4b0060ccda34a37|title=Your Brief And Far-Out Guide To Afrofuturism|last=Frank|first=Priscilla|date=2016-04-25|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Barnes]] has been called an Afrofuturist author for his alternate-history novels ''[[Lion's Blood]]'' and ''[[Zulu Heart]]''.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt; [[N.

"Loving the Alien." ''The Wire'' 96 (February 1992): 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt; this association has been somewhat controversial, since Butler incorporates multi-ethnic and multi-species communities that insist on "hybridity beyond the point of discomfort".&lt;ref name="Kilgore"&gt;Kilgore, De Witt Douglas and Ranu Samantrai. "A Memorial to Octavia E. Butler." ''Science Fiction Studies'' 37.3 (November 2010): 353–361. {{JSTOR|25746438}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the fourth book of the science fiction [[Patternist series]], ''[[Wild Seed (novel)|Wild Seed]]'', particularly fits ideas of Afrofuturist thematic concerns, as the narrative of two immortal Africans Doro and Anyanwu features science fiction technologies and an alternate anti-colonialist history of seventeenth century America.&lt;ref name="Canavan"&gt;Canavan, Gerry.

=== Museum and gallery exhibitions ===

In recent years, there have been many museum exhibitions displaying art with Afrofuturist themes.

The [[Studio Museum in Harlem|Studio Museum]] in Harlem held a major exhibit exploring Afrofuturistic aesthetics from November 14, 2013 to March 9, 2014. The exhibit, called ''The Shadows Took Shape'', displayed more than sixty works of art that looked at recurring themes such as identity in relation to technology, time, and space within African-American communities. Artists featured in the exhibit included Derrick Adams, [[Laylah Ali]] and Khaled Hafez.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.studiomuseum.org/exhibition/the-shadows-took-shape|title=The Shadows Took Shape|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a part of the MOMA's PS1 festival, [[King Britt]] curated ''Moondance: A Night in the Afro Future'' in 2014.

The representation and treatment of black female bodies is deconstructed by Afrofuturist contemporaries and amplified to alien and gruesome dimensions by artists such as [[Wangechi Mutu]] and Shoshanna Weinberger.

===The grotesque===

In the Afro-Surreal Manifesto, [[Afro-Surrealism]] is juxtaposed with European surrealism, with European surrealism being empirical. It is consistent with the New Black Aesthetic in that the art seeks to disturb. It samples from old art pieces updating them with current images. This technique calls to the forefront those past images and the sentiments, memories, or ideas around them and combines them with new images in a way that those of the current generation can still identify. Both seek to disturb, but there is more of a "mutant" psychology that is going on. Afro-Futuristic artists seek to propose a deviant beauty, a beauty in which disembodiment is both inhumane, yet distinct; Afro-Futuristic artists speculate on the future, where Afro-Surrealism is about the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=D. Scott|title=AfroSurreal Generation: AFROSURREAL MANIFESTO|url=https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Fp4HdcXrTxW2ZhNKDWPK|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214100010/https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Fp4HdcXrTxW2ZhNKDWPK|archivedate=14 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alienation===
Afrofuturism takes representations of the lived realities of black people in the past and present, and reexamines the narratives to attempt to build new truths outside of the dominant cultural narrative. By analyzing the ways in which alienation has occurred, Afrofuturism works to connect the African diaspora with its histories and knowledge of racialized bodies. Space and aliens function as key products of the science fiction elements; black people are envisioned to have been the first aliens by way of the [[Middle Passage]]. Their alien status connotes being in a foreign land with no history, but as also being disconnected from the past via the traditions of slavery where slaves were made to renounce their ties to Africa in service of their slave master.&lt;ref name="Mayer"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Ruth|date=2000|year=|title='Africa As an Alien Future': The Middle Passage, Afrofuturism, and Postcolonial Waterworlds|journal=Amerikastudien / American Studies|volume=45|issue=4|pages=558|jstor=41157608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kodwo Eshun]] locates the first alienation within the context of the Middle Passage. He writes that Afrofuturist texts work to reimagine slavery and alienation by using "extraterrestriality as a hyperbolic trope to explore the historical terms, the everyday implications of forcibly imposed dislocation, and the constitution of Black Atlantic subjectivities". This location of dystopian futures and present realities places science fiction and novels built around dystopian societies directly in the tradition of black realities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eshun|first=Kodwo|authorlink=Kodwo Eshun|title=Further Considerations of Afrofuturism|journal=CR: The New Centennial Review|volume=3|issue=2|year=2003|pages=287–302|doi=10.1353/ncr.2003.0021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water ===
In Afrofuturism, water in many different works symbolizes both erasure and the existence of black life. These dual meanings while seemingly contradictory actually play off and inform each other. For instance, the middle passage can be considered where the first erasure happened of African- American history. There are no stories that survived that passage. As Ruth Mayer states, in the United States, "black history is both there and not there, evident in countless traces, scars, and memories, yet largely submerged when it comes to written accounts and first person documentations of the past from the viewpoint of the victims."&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt; Yet, it is through this erasure that Afrofuturism is able to craft histories. These histories live both in fact and in fiction, as the true history was lost in the waters of the Atlantic. Water erased the history, but it also allowed for the creation of a new history.

This is where Afrofuturism comes into play. To have a future, one's past must be defined. However, for African Americans, though their "history" has been drowned, Afrofuturism resuscitates this history. By its creation, it creates new possibilities for the future. In [[Carrie Mae Weems]]' triptych ''Untitled'' (Ebo Landing), the Afrofuturism piece crafts a space with two pictures that could be both African and America with its depiction of lush greenery. In this way, the piece highlights how the original space of water has given way in which Afrofuturism can imagine a past or future that lives in the space of truth and fiction, the Schrödinger's cat of African American past.

Another example of an Afrofuturist work that deals specifically with the theme of water is 2009 film ''[[Pumzi]]'', which depicts an enclosed society in which water is utterly scarce and totally conserved. The film's ambiguous ending leaves viewers wondering whether there was a neighboring society with access to water the whole time, or if the main character has died a heroine by planting a tree that will eventually bloom into a whole forest.

=== Reclamation ===
Ostensibly, Afrofuturism has to do with reclaiming the lost identities or lost perspectives that have been subverted or overlooked. When Mark Dery first coined the term, he says Afrofuturism as "giving rise to a troubling antinomy". This means that the seeming contradiction of a past being snuffed out and the writing of a future sees its possibilities in Afrofuturism. Furthermore, this Afrofuturism kind of story telling is not regulated to one aspect of communication. It is in novels and essays, academic writings and in music, but by its creation, it is ultimately reclaiming some type of autonomy over one's story that has historically been restricted.

Therefore, when Afrofuturism manifests itself in the music of the 80's and beyond, it is under the Afrofuturist's sensibility. It is in this way that, as Mark Dery says, "African-American culture is Afrofuturist at its heart". Because the ancestors of African Americans were forcibly removed from their history, any culture that has found its way into the Black lexicon is at its roots an Afrofuturist notion. It is at its heart reclaiming a past erased and creating a future based on that reimagined past.

== Afrofuturism 2.0 ==
Afrofuturism 2.0 was coined during an exchange between Alondra Nelson and Reynaldo Anderson at the Alien Bodies conference in 2013; where Anderson noted that the previous definition was insufficient due to the rise of social media and new technology. Following the publication of the co-edited volume Afrofuturism 2.0: The Rise of Astro-Blackness, in the late 2010s, the ''Black Speculative Arts Movement'', a traveling art, comic, and film convention, released a manifesto called ''Afrofuturism 2.0 and the Black Speculative Arts Movement: Notes on a Manifesto''.&lt;ref name="BSAM Manifesto"&gt;{{cite web |first=Reynaldo  |last=Anderson |title=Afrofuturism 2.0 and the Black Speculative Arts Movement: NOTES ON A MANIFESTO |website=Black Speculative Arts Movement |url=https://blackspeculativeartsmovement.wordpress.com/bsam-manifesto/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto was written by Reynaldo Anderson at Harris-Stowe State University as an attempt to redefine and refit Afrofuturism for the 21st century. The 2.0 volume and the manifesto defines Afrofuturism 2.0 as "The early twenty-first century technogenesis of Black identity reflecting counter histories, hacking and or appropriating the influence of network software, database logic, cultural analytics, deep remixability, neurosciences, enhancement and augmentation, gender fluidity, posthuman possibility, the speculative sphere with transdisciplinary applications and has grown into an important Diasporic techno-cultural Pan African movement".&lt;ref name="BSAM Manifesto"/&gt; Afrofuturism 2.0 is characterized by five dimensions to include metaphysics, aesthetics, theoretical and applied science, social sciences and programmatic spaces; and in the twenty-first century is no longer bound to its original definition, as a term once dealing with cultural aesthetics and the digital divide, but has been broaden to be known also as a philosophy of science, metaphysics and geopolitics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Reynaldo|title=Afrofuturism: The Digital Turn and the Visual Art of Kanye West|url=http://people.exeter.ac.uk/sr436/Visual%20Art%20of%20Kanye%20West.pdf|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this manifesto, Anderson acknowledges and accounts for the changes in technology, social movements, and even philosophical changes in modern society while also speculating as to how the Afrofuturist narrative will be changed because of it. This is particularly in regards to the rise and boom of social media platforms.

In conjunction with this, Los Angeles-based artist [[Martine Syms]] penned an online article in 2013 called ''The Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto'' that is composed of a list of tenets that, supposedly, all Mundane Afrofuturists recognize. Though the article is in part parodic and sarcastic, it aims to identify and make light of overused tropes within Afrofuturist works like "magical Negroes" or "references to Sun Ra". Through this identification of "overused tropes" and a later definition of rules to actually subvert these tropes entitled "The Mundane Afrofuturist promise",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/dec/17/mundane-afrofuturist-manifesto/|title=The Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto|last=Syms|first=Martine|date=December 17, 2013|website=Rhizome|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syms requests a new, updated vision for Afrofuturist works, which falls in line with the framework of Afrofuturism 2.0.

'''Ageless''' is an adjective describing a person or thing whose [[ageing|age]] cannot be defined, is non-existent, or appears not to change. It can also describe something that has always existed without a precise beginning or an end.

Agelessness can be used as a synonym for [[immortality]]; more specifically it refers to [[eternal youth]].

==Ageless people==
Agelessness can be attributed to individuals whose physical or mental characteristics appear young for their biological age.

The [[Castrati]] singers of the [[Renaissance]] aged differently from other men due to the lack of [[testosterone]] and other hormones, which may have altered their appearance and stature. Specifically, [[Alessandro Moreschi]] (1858–1922) was described as having no facial hair and a childish voice and appearance.

===Modern examples===
The illusion of agelessness seems to be a goal for many individuals, such as [[Hollywood]] celebrities, that have been known to strive for, sometimes undergoing extensive and/or risky cosmetic surgeries. [[Demi Moore]], [[Naomi Campbell]], [[Eminem]], [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] are particularly mentioned in the media for their alleged efforts to appear 'forever young'. Television host [[Dick Clark]] was often described as "America's Oldest Teenager."  Many of his viewers report difficulty in perceiving typical signs of aging since the 1960s, despite him being born in 1929. The age of [[Andy Milonakis]] is also ambiguous to many viewers since he is known to possess a hormone disorder, which allows him to perform the role of a young teenager in his shows despite being much older. Another celebrity who is commonly described as having the appearance of a teenager is the actor [[Eddie Redmayne]], born 1982, due to his virtual lack of [[facial hair|beard growth]], causing many people to report he appears no older than 20 years of age.

Actor [[Suzanne Somers]] attributes her youthful appearance to the use of [[bioidentical hormone replacement therapy]]. Her 2006 book ''Ageless'' continues the theme of her 2004 book ''The Sexy Years'' that restoring [[hormone]]s (especially [[sex steroid|sex hormone]]s) to youthful levels is the primary key to an ageless appearance.

===Methods to achieve agelessness===
[[Cosmetics]] exist largely to supposedly aid in attempts to diminish the effects of age. The use of such cosmetics has been known to sometimes create conflicting age indicators (for example, red hair belonging to a wrinkled face), making age determination difficult.

[[Botox]], [[silicone]] implants, [[tummy tuck]]s, [[facelift]]s, and [[nosejob]]s are examples of surgeries that attempt to remove the signs of aging.  Sooner or later, however, the effects of the passing years do start to show on the body as it endures wear and tear. Scientists all over the world are also working on finding the [[senescence|reason of aging]] and have developed various theories, however, much more research is needed before this phenomenon can be fully understood and potentially controlled.

==Mythology==
Gods and goddesses were considered eternal in many ancient mythologies, and were endowed with [[eternal youth]]. In [[Greek mythology]], agelessness was achieved by the gods' eating [[ambrosia]] (immortality was derived from their blood, [[ichor]]); in [[Norse mythology]], by the gods eating golden apples provided by [[Iðunn]]; and in [[Chinese mythology]], by the gods consuming the [[Peaches of Immortality]].

==Media and fiction==

===Comics and cartoons===
Agelessness is prominent in [[anime]], [[manga]], [[cartoon]]s, [[comic book]]s, [[comic strip]]s, and other illustrated media. Characters and situations are staged in an [[presentism (philosophy of time)|eternal present]] where change and causality are considered arbitrary and disposable. Ageless characters in comic books often appear as [[superhero]]es, deriving immortal or timeless properties from accelerated or supernatural healing, [[time travel]], [[interdimensional travel|interdimensional]] origin, and other fictional devices. In comics and cartoons, agelessness is sometimes used to preserve continuity in a [[floating timeline]] or an [[episode|episodic format]] respectively. For example, Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny are ageless cartoon and comic characters.

===Pulp literature===
Long-running series of [[pulp magazine|pulp novels]] can develop ageless characters. The main characters in [[The Hardy Boys]] have remained 17 and 18, and have been located approximately in the "present day" since 1926. The same can be said for [[Nancy Drew|The Nancy Drew series]]. Nancy has remained 18 years old for many decades (although she started out at the age of 16).

[[James Bond]] is also known by many as an ageless character. Some of his ally characters, including [[M (James Bond)|M]], [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], [[Miss Moneypenny]], [[Bill Tanner]] and [[Felix Leiter]] also do not age throughout both the novel and film series, which began in 1953 and 1962 respectively. [[Ian Fleming]], the creator of Bond, tinkered with details of Bond's early life and changed dates to ensure Bond was always the appropriate age for his stories, a practice called [[retconning]].

===Fantasy literature===
[[Tolkien]]'s [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] are an iconic example of creatures who are ageless. They are not subject to [[entropy]] and decay, unlike [[Edain|Men]] and the rest of the [[Middle-earth]]. Tolkien described his elves as young-looking, yet with some properties of 'wisdom' and experience in their eyes and behaviour; Tolkien also stated that Elves do experience change and aging—not by growing old, but by altering other features of their appearance. The combination of physical youth and immense mental maturity can render the perceived age of an Elf undefinable and alien by mortal standards.

The [[Aes Sedai]] of [[Robert Jordan]]'s [[The Wheel of Time|''Wheel of Time'']] series are described as ageless. A feature of their magical abilities extends life and makes their age difficult to place despite their white hair and physical frailty.

===Television and soap operas===
On television, the process of a character (usually a child) aging unusually fast has been a common feature in [[soap operas]] and is known as [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome]] or "SORAS". The reverse effect, where characters fail to age at the typical rate they should or in fact become younger, is known by a more recent, opposite term known as [[de-SORAS]].  On the British television show [[Doctor Who]], which involves time travel, all of the Doctor's incarnations appear not to age, except for the First Doctor. It's also implied on [[Sarah Jane Adventures]] episode [[Death of the Doctor]] that the Doctor's first companions Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright have never aged since their travels; Also, despite the fact that 10 years of the life of the Pond-Williams passed between [[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]] and  [[The Angels Take Manhattan]], they didn't show any major traits associated with aging. Several characters on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] 2011 TV series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' do not age, either through the effects of the Dark Curse or spending time in [[Neverland]]; in the case of [[Killian Jones|Hook]], both are true. Other characters, such as [[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin]] or [[Merlin]] and his [[The Sorcerer's Apprentice|apprentice]], do not age due to the fact that they possess [[immortality]].

'''Alberto Randegger''' (13 April 1832 – 18 December 1911) was an Italian-born composer, conductor and singing teacher, best known for promoting [[opera]] and new works of British music in England during the [[Victorian era]] and for his widely used textbook on singing technique.

==Life and career==
Randegger was born in [[Trieste]], [[Italy]], the son of musician mother and schoolteacher father. He met [[Giuseppe Verdi]] in Trieste, in 1850, and later became known as a great interpreter of Verdi's operas.&lt;ref&gt;"Alberto Randegger". ''The Musical Times and Singing Class Circular'', Vol. 40, No. 680, 1 October 1899, pp. 653-58&lt;/ref&gt; He was a pupil of Jean Lafont in piano and of [[Luigi Ricci (composer)|Luigi Ricci]] in composition.&lt;ref name="Colby, Williams 1914, p. 539"&gt;{{NIE |inline=1 |title=Randegger, Alberto |year=1914 |edition=2nd |volume=19 |page=539 |url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101064517277?urlappend=%3Bseq=615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
His earliest compositions were masses and other pieces of church music and, with two other young pupils of Ricci, produced two [[ballet]]s and an [[opera]], ''Il Lazzarone,'' in 1852. In 1854 he composed another opera, ''Bianca Capello'', at [[Brescia]].&lt;ref name="Colby, Williams 1914, p. 539"/&gt; During this period, he also served as music director of theatres in [[Fiume]], [[Senigallia]], Brescia and [[Venice]].&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;Grove, George, et al. "Alberto Randegger". ''Grove Music Online''. ''Oxford Music Online''. Retrieved on 16 June 2008. (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Randegger began work in London as an organist at St. Paul's in [[Regent's Park]] from his arrival there, in 1854, until 1879.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Beginning in 1857, he conducted Italian opera at the [[St. James's Theatre]].&lt;ref name="Colby, Williams 1914, p. 539"/&gt;  He also became well known as a teacher of singing in [[London]], both privately and at the [[Royal College of Music]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Beginning in 1868, he was conductor at the Wolverhampton Festival.   The same year, he was appointed [[professor]] of singing at the [[Royal Academy of Music]],&lt;ref name="Colby, Williams 1914, p. 539"/&gt; where he was appointed a director and a member of the committee of management.  He continued teaching at both the College and the Academy until his death.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;  His notable pupils included sopranos [[Liza Lehmann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Baker | first = Theodore | contribution = Lehmann, Liza | year = 1992 | title = Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians, Eighth Edition | editor-last = Slonimsky | editor-first = Nicolas | pages = 1030–31 | place = New York | publisher = Schirmer Books | isbn = 0-02-872415-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greta Williams]]&lt;ref&gt;Wyndham, Henry Saxe &amp; L'Epine, Geoffrey (1915).

As a composer, in addition to his early works, Randegger wrote a [[comic opera]], ''The Rival Beauties'' (1864);&lt;ref name="Colby, Williams 1914, p. 539"/&gt; the vocal scenas Medea (1869); a musical play with dramatist [[W.

He also edited several collections of vocal music and collaborated with [[T. J. H. Marzials]] on the libretto for [[Arthur Goring Thomas]]'s opera ''[[Esmeralda (opera)|Esmeralda]]'' (1883).

Randegger served as musical director of the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]] from 1879 to 1885,&lt;ref name="Colby, Williams 1914, p. 539"/&gt; helping to revive interest in opera in England. In 1880, [[George Grove]] wrote: "The careful way in which the pieces are put on the stage, the number of rehearsals, the eminence of the performers and the excellence of the performers have begun to bear their legitimate fruit, and the Carl Rosa Opera Company bids fair to become a permanent English institution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carlrosaopera.co.uk/history/index.asp Information from the Carl Rosa history page]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the resignation of [[Julius Benedict]] in 1881, he also became conductor of the Norwich Musical Festival, which he directed until 1905.  There he conducted new works by Cowen, J. F. Barnett, Stanford, [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], Prout, Parry, [[Edward German]] and others, and at the 1905 Festival invited 14 British composers to conduct performances of their own works.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;  From 1885 to 1887, he also conducted [[Henry David Leslie|Henry Leslie]]'s Choir.  He conducted the Queen's Hall Choral Society and the first two seasons of symphony concerts at Queen's Hall from 1895 to 1897.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;   Finally, from 1887 to 1898, he conducted at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] and at the [[Royal Opera House]], where he became known for his performances of [[Wagner]], Verdi and [[Mozart]] operas.

Randegger's most important legacy, outside of his conducting, was a textbook entitled ''Singing'', published in 1879 by [[Novello &amp; Co]], which is still used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Johnson|first= Keith|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p174416|pure_url=yes}} |title=Alberto Randegger Biography| year=2006 |accessdate=21 May 2008 |publisher= ''Allmusic''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, Randegger was elected an honorary member of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]].

Randegger was married first to the actress [[Adeline Hayden Coffin|Adeline de Leuw]] whom he divorced in 1892 (and who later married [[Hayden Coffin]]), and on 11 March 1897 he married the American singer [[Louise Baldwin]] (her second marriage).&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/03/23/102059211.pdf NY Times article about Randegger's marriage to Baldwin, dated March 23, 1897]&lt;/ref&gt;

Randegger died at his home in London at the age of 79.

'''''At Home With Julia''''' is a four-part Australian sitcom television series, created and written by [[Amanda Bishop]], [[Rick Kalowski]] and [[Phil Lloyd (actor)|Phil Lloyd]], which debuted on 7 September 2011 on [[ABC1]]. A re-run of the series aired on [[ABC2]] in April 2012.  Currently, the series is in syndication in the [[United States]] on [[Vibrant TV Network]].   

The series depicts a fictional representation of the relationship between [[Julia Gillard]], the actual [[Prime Minister of Australia]] (played by [[Amanda Bishop]]), and Gillard's real-life partner, [[Tim Mathieson]] (played by [[Phil Lloyd (actor)|Phil Lloyd]]). Fictionalised versions of actual Australian politicians and media personalities are portrayed throughout the series.  Much of the action takes place at [[The Lodge (Australia)|The Lodge]], the Prime Minister's official residence in the national capital of [[Canberra]].   

Although the first episode was received either relatively well or neutrally by the media, many critics responded negatively by the series' end. Some saw ''At Home with Julia'' as defying previous boundaries in [[political satire]] and [[Parody#Social_and_political_uses|political parody]], with its emphasis on a female politician's personal life rather than her politics and public life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=Ana|date=2013|title=Making Gender Divisive: "Post-Feminism," Sexism and Media Representations of Julia Gillard|url=http://www.academia.edu/5534293/Making_Gender_Divisive_Post-Feminism_Sexism_and_Media_Representations_of_Julia_Gillard|journal=Burgmann Journal|volume=2|pages=53-66|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the media, viewers, and politicians were scandalised by the notorious "flag scene" from Episode 3 ("The Leaker")—in which the Prime Minister and partner Tim Mathieson were depicted apparently naked and post-coital under the Australian flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-09-20/mps-angered-over-gillard-satire-sex-scene/2908158|title=MPs angered over Gillard satire sex scene|date=2011-09-20|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-09-15|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

The series was a 2012 [[AACTA|Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts]] Awards nominee for Best Television Comedy Series.&lt;ref name=nominees&gt;{{cite web |title=Inaugural Samsung AACTA Awards Nominees |url=http://aacta.org/media/161534/awards%20docs_all_network.pdf |website=[[Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts]] |access-date=1 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191132/http://aacta.org/media/161534/awards%20docs_all_network.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticised by several social commentators as inappropriately disrespectful to the office of Prime Minister,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craven |first=Peter |title=At Home With Julia: inane drivel of the most idiotic kind |url=http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/2877228.html |website=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=6 July 2015 |date=8 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
the show nevertheless proved very popular both with television audiences — becoming the most watched Australian scripted comedy series of 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.encoremagazine.com.au/packed-to-the-rafters-and-underbelly-are-2011s-top-local-dramas-11731 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211220642/http://www.encoremagazine.com.au/packed-to-the-rafters-and-underbelly-are-2011s-top-local-dramas-11731 |archive-date=11 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; — and with television critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Knox |first=David |title=Critics’ Choice: The Best of 2011 |url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2011/12/critics-choice-the-best-of-2011.html |website=TV Tonight |accessdate=6 July 2015|date=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to media reports, international versions of the series are being developed in the United Kingdom and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Knox |first=David |title=At Home with David Cameron next? |url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2011/10/at-home-with-david-cameron-next.html |website=TV Tonight |accessdate=6 July 2015 |date=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
None of these shows however have been commissioned as of September 2013. 

The series was sold to the United States for broadcast in 2012 and can there be viewed on [[Hulu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Idato |first=Michael |title=Networking: Julia finds a home in the US |url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/networking-julia-finds-a-home-in-the-us-20120704-21fyz.html |website=The Age |accessdate=6 July 2015 |date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, the notorious "flag sex-scene" from Episode 3 ("The Leaker") was featured in the [[ABC1]] series ''Shock Horror Aunty!'', a compilation of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s most controversial broadcast comedy incidents.

No second series was produced due to the uncertainty of how long the real Gillard would remain Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knox |first=David |url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2011/09/no-decision-on-at-home-with-julia.html |title=No decision on At Home with Julia – TV Tonight |publisher=Tvtonight.com.au |date= |accessdate=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amanda Bishop did reprise the role of Gillard for ''Wednesday Night Fever'', however the real Gillard was ousted as Labor Party leader and thus Prime Minister just prior to the show's debut on ABC1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knox |first=David |url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/06/wednesday-night-fever-rewrites-after-labor-spill.html |title=Wednesday Night Fever rewrites after Labor spill – TV Tonight |publisher=Tvtonight.com.au |date= |accessdate=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an atmosphere of budgetary cuts to the ABC and severe criticism of the use of political satire on it, no follow-up series has been produced about [[Tony Abbott]], the former Coalition Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/subscribe/news/1/index.html?sourceCode=TAWEB_WRE170_a&amp;mode=premium&amp;dest=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/abc-news-and-current-affairs-sink-to-new-lows/story-e6frg7bo-1227123601026&amp;memtype=anonymous |title=Nocookies |publisher=The Australian |date= |accessdate=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The life of Julia's non-celebrity partner, [[Tim Mathieson]], is anything but hectic; he fills in time by running household errands for the PM's official residence—[[The Lodge (Australia)|The Lodge]]—since staff cover all the gardening and house-cleaning. Julia and Tim try to reserve space on the calendar to be alone together, but their "date night" keeps getting rescheduled, this time because Julia has to invite three [[independent (politician)|independent]] members of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] ([[Bob Katter]], [[Tony Windsor]] and [[Rob Oakeshott]]) to the Lodge for dinner, to discuss their demand to prohibit imported food. Problem is, the Lodge's beer fridge is filled with imported beer, and the local butcher only stocks (very expensive) imported meat. Meanwhile some neighbourhood kids get hold of a gun which a member of the PM's security team, parked in the street, had placed on the car dashboard so he could sleep more comfortably.

When it is realised that the Prime Minister is missing, Tim is grilled by a hard-nosed federal police agent who is still wracked with guilt regarding his failures in the [[Harold Holt#Disappearance|1967 disappearance]] of then Prime Minister [[Harold Holt]].

'''''Black Lightning''''' is an American [[superhero fiction|superhero]] television series developed by [[Salim Akil]], airing on [[The CW]]. It is based on the [[DC Comics]] [[Black Lightning|character of the same name]], created by [[Tony Isabella]] and [[Trevor Von Eeden]]. It stars [[Cress Williams]] as the titular character alongside [[China Anne McClain]], [[Nafessa Williams]], [[Christine Adams (actress)|Christine Adams]], [[Krondon|Marvin Jones III]], [[Damon Gupton]], and [[James Remar]]. The series sees the retired Black Lightning return to the hero life and its effects on his family life.

Development on the series began in September 2016 when [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] ordered a pilot production commitment for ''Black Lightning''. In February 2017, Fox passed on the series, with it being picked up by The CW with a new script for the pilot. The CW officially ordered the series in May 2017. The [[Black Lightning (season 1)|first season]] premiered on January 16, 2018, for a 13-episode run. On April 2, 2018, The CW renewed the show for a [[Black Lightning (season 2)|second season]], which premiered on October 9, 2018.

==Premise==
High school principal Jefferson Pierce, who retired from his superhero persona [[Black Lightning]] nine years ago after seeing the effects it had on his family, is forced to become a [[vigilante]] again when the rise of the local gang called the 100 leads to increased crime and corruption in his community of Freeland.&lt;ref name="NewPremise"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/05/18/cw-superheroes-crossover-black-lightning-flash-arrow-legends-tomorrow/|title=The CW's Black Lightning not part of Arrowverse, crossover unlikely|last=Abrams|first=Natalie|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=May 18, 2017|accessdate=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In season two, as Black Lightning continues his feud with the 100's leader [[Tobias Whale]], he and his family deal with the arising anti-superhuman bigotry within their community after its metahuman members' existences are exposed.

==Connection to the Arrowverse==
{{further|Arrowverse}}

Despite airing on The CW and being created by Berlanti, Mark Pedowitz, president of The CW said in May 2017 that the series "at this time, is not part of the [[Arrowverse]]. It is a separate situation."&lt;ref name="NewPremise" /&gt; Berlanti had previously stated when the series was in development at Fox that it would not crossover with his other DC Comics television properties on The CW nor would it exist in the Arrowverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/foxs-black-lightning-show-wont-cross-over-with-the-arrowverse/|title=Fox's Black Lightning Show Won't Cross Over With The Arrowverse|last=Gerding|first=Stephen|publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=January 9, 2017|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Akil later stated that they were not ruling out eventual crossovers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/black-lightning-tv-show-spoilers-what-eps-revealed-atx-2550641|title=‘Black Lightning’ TV Show Spoilers: What The EPs Revealed At ATX|last=Massabrook|first=Nicole|publisher=International Business Times|date=June 11, 2017|accessdate=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, Pedowitz added, "If [the showrunners] wish to bring it in, that is their call. We had a long discussion with the studio, Mara, Salim, and myself. We were fine with them making it separate from the Arrowverse, they have a different point of view. If they end up wanting to go that way, that will be their decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/02/this-arrowverse-crossover-will-fully-take-place-across-every-show-from-supergirl-to-legends-of-tomorrow|title=This Arrowverse Crossover Will Fully Take Place Across Every Show From Supergirl To Legends of Tomorrow|last=Schwartz|first=Terri|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=August 2, 2017|accessdate=August 7, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6sXpqo5uc|archivedate=August 7, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salim Akil noted references in the first season to the Arrowverse heroes Vixen and Supergirl were a "fun" way "to tease the fans". He also further reiterated that the series existed on a separate Earth from the other Arrowverse series (like Earth-1 from ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', and ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' and Earth-38 from ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'') and was hopeful that any future crossover would involve the heroes of the other series visiting the Earth that is associated with ''Black Lightning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/tv/2018/04/16/black-lightning-boss-addresses-arrowverse-references/|title=Black Lightning boss addresses those Arrowverse references|last=Agard|first=Chancellor|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=April 16, 2018|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
'''Bosnia and Herzegovina art''' is art from the region of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and its constituent ethno-religious groups ([[Bosniaks]], [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]]) from [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times to today.

==Ancient heritage==

=== Prehistory===
[[Image:Badanj.jpg|thumb|left|"Horse attacked by arrows", engraving in cave Badanj near [[Stolac]], c. 14000 BC.]]In the boundaries of today’s [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] there have been many layers of prehistory cultures and their creation and disappearance is linked to migrations of unidentified ethnic groups.

[[Paleolithic]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina is marked with the oldest monument of Paleolithic in southeastern Europe - [[engraving]]s in a cave named ''Badanj'' near [[Stolac]] in [[Herzegovina]]. Most famous being the ''Horse attacked by arrows'', preserved in fragments and dated around 14500-12000 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Lovrenović 2001. Bosnia: a cultural history. New York. New York University Press. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time when [[Neolithic]] and [[Copper]] cultures were starting to appear, in Bosnia and Herzegovina began interesting mixture of [[Mediterranean]] cultures and those of [[Panonian]] cultures.
Herzegovina was under the influence of impresso ceramics from western Mediterranean as seen in ''Green Cave'' near [[Mostar]], ''Čairi'' near [[Stolac]], ''Lisičići'' near [[Konjic]] and ''Peć Mlini'' near [[Grude]]. People used to live in caves or simple settlements on hilltops.
In the upper mainstream of Bosna river and northeast parts of Bosnia (''Obra I'' near [[Kakanj]]) people used to live in wooden houses built along rivers. In that culture we can see influences from Adriatic cultures on south and ''Starčević culture'' on northeast. Original expressions of that culture are ceramic pots on four legs, so called – [[Rhyton]]. We can find the also in ''Danilo culture'' on the Croatian coast. Thanks to these pieces, Kakanj culture is considered a part of wide circle of Neolithic nations that followed a ''cult of life force'' (from northern [[Italy]], [[Dalmatia]] and [[Epirus]] to [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]).
[[Butmir Culture]] near [[Sarajevo]] is distinctive with fine glazed ceramics with miscellaneous geometrical decorations (often spirals).&lt;ref&gt;W. Radymský / M. Hoernes, Die neolithische Station von Butmir bei Sarajevo in Bosnien. Ausgrabungen im Jahre 1893 (Wien 1895).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Z. Kujundzič-Vejzagič / J. Müller / K. Rassmann / T. Schüler, Okolište – Grabung und Geomagnetik eines zentralbosnischen Tells aus der ersten Hälfte des 5. vorchristlichen Jahrtausends. In: B. Hänsel (Hrsg.), Parerga Praehistorica: Jubiläumsschrift zur Prähistorischen Archäologie. 15 Jahre UPA. Universitätsforsch. Prähist. Arch. 100 (Bonn 2004) 69–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Figures from Butmir are unique sculptures modeled with hand; heads are almost like portraits with emphasized parts of body.

[[Image:Daorson.jpg|thumb|260 px|right|Monumental city walls of [[Daorson]] near Stolac, 4th century BC.]][[Bronze Age]] settlements in Herzegovina were built like [[citadel]]s (natively called - ''gradina''), and in Bosnia we have necropolises with stone [[tumuli]]. During that time, bronze arms, decorated plates, flat necklaces and fibulas were decorated with specific geometrical style of engraved ornaments.
From 7th century BC bronze is replaced by iron, and only jewelry and art objects were still made out of bronze. Bronze culture of [[Illyrians]], ethnic group with distinct culture and art form started to organize itself on today’s Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Different Illyrian tribes, under the influence of [[Halstat]] cultures from north, formed original regional centers. With the notable exception of [[Pod, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Pod]] near [[Bugojno]] in the upper valley of the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas River]], nothing is known of their settlements. In eastern Bosnia in the cemeteries of ''Belotić'' and ''Bela Crkva'', the rites of inhumation and [[cremation]] are attested, with skeletons in stone [[cists]] and cremations in [[urns]]. Metal implements appear here side-by-side with stone implements. Most of the remains belong to the fully developed Middle Bronze Age.
Very important role in their life was ''the cult of the dead'', which is seen in their careful burials and burial ceremonies, as well as richness of the burial sites. In northern parts there was long tradition of [[cremation]] and burial in shallow graves, while in the south the dead were buried in large stone, or earth tumuli (natively called – ''gromile'') that in Herzegovina were reaching monumental sizes, more than 50&amp;nbsp;m wide and 5&amp;nbsp;m high.
''Japodian'' tribes (found around [[Bihać]]) have had affinity to decoration (heavy, oversized necklaces out of yellow, blue or white glass paste, and large bronze fibulas, as well as spiral bracelets, diadems and helmets out of bronze foil.

In 4th century BC first outbreak of [[Celts]] is recorded. They brought the technique of the pottery wheel, new types of fibulas and different bronze and iron belts. They only passed on their way to Greece, so their influence in Bosnia and Herzegovina is negligible.

===Antiquity===

[[Image:Drinovci-starokršćanska krstionica.jpg|thumb|right|Stone baptistery from ''Drinovci'' near [[Grude]], 4th century.]]
In the [[Neretva Delta]] in the south there was important [[Hellenistic]] influence of Illyrian tribe [[Daors]]. Their capital was [[Daorson]] in ''Ošanići'' near [[Stolac]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stolac.org/4images/categories.php?cat_id=10 Images of antiquities from Daorson] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207182903/http://www.stolac.org/4images/categories.php?cat_id=10 |date=December 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to date, main center of Ancient culture in B&amp;H. Daorson in 4th century BC was surrounded by [[megalithic]], {{convert|5|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} stonewalls (large as those of [[Mycenae]] in [[Greece]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piramidasunca.ba/en/index.php/DAORSON-CITY-FALSE-INTERPRETATIONS-UP-TO-THE-PRESENT.html Daorson City] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004112814/http://www.piramidasunca.ba/en/index.php/DAORSON-CITY-FALSE-INTERPRETATIONS-UP-TO-THE-PRESENT.html |date=October 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; composed out of large trapeze stones blocks. Daors have made their unique bronze coins and sculptures.
Finally, [[Roman Empire|Romans]] subdued the Illyrians in first century BC, and after that the history of these parts is history of [[Illyria]]n provinces of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]].

In Bosnia and Herzegovina Romans built several small [[temples]] decorated with [[reliefs]]. The complex of ''step sanctuary in Gradac'' near [[Posušje]] from year 184 AD had [[marble]] temple dedicated to recently deceased emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]].
On the reliefs we can feel [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalism]] of native craftsmen, and in [[mosaics]] the Hellenistic influence, especially in those found in [[villa]]s near [[Stolac]] (second half of the 3rd century).
Late Roman art in B&amp;H is marked with building of villas, Christian [[mausoleum]]s, [[basilicas]] and [[oratories]] like: ''Mausoleum in Šipovo'' near [[Jajce]] and ''Villa [[Mogorjelo]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/mogorjelo Answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Čapljina]] (early 4th century).
Sculptures that we inherited are ones like: ''Hellenistic relief of Minerva, Jupiter and genius-protector from Šipovo'' (2nd century) and extremely barbarically stylized relief of ''four friends from [[Zenica]]'' (end of the 4th century).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zemaljskimuzej.ba/arheologija/antika.php Ancient monuments - National archeological museum in Sarajevo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506005533/http://www.zemaljskimuzej.ba/arheologija/antika.php |date=May 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval art in Bosnia and Herzegovina==
[[Image:Stecak iz Radimlje.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;[[Stećak]] from Radimlja, 13th century.]]
[[Image:Hrvojev misal.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Illumination from [[Hrvoje's Missal]], Split, 1404.]]
In Bosnia and Herzegovina the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] influence came from [[Croatia]] and it was never accepted in full, only in use of some elements. Those few monuments with Romanesque elements that were preserved are dating from later times. For example: in the motifs from tombstones in Bosnia – natively called [[stećak]] (14th century), or the high parts of ''Tower of [[St. Luke]]'' in [[Jajce]] (15th century).

Influences of [[Gothic art]] in the 14th century are supported by culture of urban cities, [[preaching]] orders, and [[knight]]ly culture. On Bosnian culture there was slight influence of religion and the strong one of Nobility. That is recognizable in the organization of a city that is actually a settlement close to [[feudal]] [[fortress]]. Feudal fortress is of thick roughly cut stonewalls, shape is following the terrain, buildings have steppe roofs and towers are often and high. The most beautiful one is perhaps ''Royal Court in [[Kraljeva Sutjeska]]''; it has [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] [[Portal (architecture)|portals]] and windows, [[buttresses]], and high rooftops (very practical because of snow).

The way some Bosnian nobility treated its dead is somewhat special. From the earliest times of [[Bosnian Kingdom]] the nobility was buried in large necropolises near the roads with graves marked by a monumental tombstone called stećak. [[Stećak]] (or ''mramor'' or ''bilig'') comes in several different shapes and was sometimes engraved with [[reliefs]] showing all sorts of motifs, from figurative to symbols, and sometimes writings in [[Bosnian Cyrillic]]. Their existence is strongly linked with heretical [[Bosnian Church]] and most of the motifs are derived from their beliefs, but some derived from Romanesque (crosses, arcades with semi-circular arches, son, half-moon etc.) and Gothic (arcades with sharp arches, knight riders, shields, swords, lilies etc.) art of the West.

There are two beautiful examples of [[illuminated manuscript]]s from medieval Bosnia. ''Hval’s missionary'', kept in Zagreb, is ravishingly decorated manuscript with many miniatures. ''Misal Hrvoja Vukčića Hrvatinića'' - a [[liturgical book]] of the Bosnian duke and ruler of Dalmatia - [[Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić]], today in [[Istanbul]], is colourfully painted with many details of knightly culture (knights, crests etc.). Both were painted in [[Split (city)|Split]], Croatia.

==Ottoman art in Bosnia and Herzegovina==
[[Image:Svrzo house.jpg|thumb|right|''Svrzo house'' in [[Sarajevo]], the typical Bosnian house from Ottoman period.]]

In the 16th century, entire Bosnia was under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule so the influences of renaissance and later baroque from west were extinguished. The only places where some western art could be fined were lonesome [[Franciscan]] monasteries in [[Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Visoko]], [[Kreševo]], [[Franciscan monastery in Fojnica]], [[Franciscan monastery in Kraljeva Sutjeska]] etc.

However, that opened a new era in B&amp;H art, that of [[Islamic Art]] and it flourished until the 19th century. Actually there were three constant art traditions in B&amp;H living side by side: Catholic-Western one, Orthodox-Byzantine (unique illuminated manuscripts and painted icons) and one and Ottoman-Islamic that was the most powerful one.

Ottomans were developing urban cities very fast upon their conquest of B&amp;H. Enriched by [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] and [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] experiences they build so much that it can be compared only with medieval building in Dalmatian cities. For example, in [[Foča]] in 16th century Ottomans build 17 [[mosque]]s, 29 public [[fountain]]s, 6 [[public bathing|public baths]] (''hamam'') and 13 caravanserai motels (han).
[[Sarajevo]] is an example of a non-urban open city where the most important buildings are organized around one veining street – ''čaršija'' (Persian chahar-su meaning all four sides). In Sarajevo the largest is famous [[Baščaršija]] with shops of 50 different crafts from the 15th century. Also in Baščaršija is most impressive ''Gazi Husrev-beg’s mosque'', also known as ''Beg’s mosque'', built in 1531. Founded on Byzantine central square plan it has dome on large drum, two smaller domes leaning on both sides of drum and a semi-dome behind; in addition, above entrance is a porch with five tiny domes. Inside it is filled with rich wall ornaments in wood and Arabic [[calligraphic]] writings. The complex is complete with a high tower (''munara'') and fountain (''šedrvan'') in the courtyard.

Islamic [[manuscript]]s, decorated in the [[Persian people|Persian]] style with beautiful [[Islamic calligraphy]], were often in B&amp;H so now we have numerous examples in the Bosnian libraries.
In the 16th century the [[Jews]] expelled from Spain came to Sarajevo, where they were allowed to settle. Beside important influence on Bosnian culture, they brought with them luxury decorated manuscript called [[Sarajevo Haggadah]] from the 14th century, now in the Sarajevo museum.

The bridge in Islamic art was very important, not only because it request great skill of an architect, but also because of symbolic meaning of a bridge in [[Islam]] where it is a mediator between heaven and earth. That’s why there is no surprise that the high point of [[Islamic architecture]] in B&amp;H is a bridge. Bridge of artisan ''Hajredin'' (pupil of the famous architect [[Mimar Sinan]] from [[Istanbul]]) in [[Mostar]] (so called: [[Stari Most|Old Bridge]]) with its arch over river Neretva is 29&amp;nbsp;m long and 19.5&amp;nbsp;m high. With subtle parabola it looks higher and more fragile than it is, an effect seen only in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedrals]].

In Bosnian Islamic architecture, stone is reserved for religious, public buildings and fortifications, while private houses were built out of wood and ''ćerpić'' (native simple bonding material made of clay and straw). With often consol constructions of the upper floors they could be more open with large windows.
When the power of Ottomans started to descend in the middle of the 17th century, so did the influence of Islamic art in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==Art in Austro-Hungarian Period==
[[Image:Sarajevo Rathaus05.jpg|thumb|left|National Library in Sarajevo]]
[[Image:Sarajevo Academy of arts 02.jpg|thumb|right|The Sarajevo Academy of Arts, on the bank of the [[Miljacka]]]]
Right after the [[Austro-Hungarian]] occupation the art scene in Bosnia comes alive. Intense building is represented in modernisation and structural transformation of cities. Architecture is in [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] [[pseudo]] styles like [[classicism]], [[neo-renaissance]], [[neo-baroque]], and even [[neo-Romanesque]], and [[neo-gothic]]. Unique pseudo style is ''“oriental eclectic”'' style (also "[[Pseudo-Moorish style]]") based on [[Islamic architecture#Moorish architecture|Moorish architecture]] of southern [[Spain]] and [[Egypt]]. That style, was quite foreign to urban ambient of Bosnian cities as can be seen in [[Sarajevo]] (National Library and City Hall), [[Mostar Gymnasium]] and [[Travnik]] (Retirement Home).

The first Bosnian artists were educated in large European academies ([[Vienna]], [[München]], [[Prague|Prag]], [[Krakow]], [[Budapest]] and [[Paris]]) thanks to scholarships of cultural societies like “[[Prosvjeta]]” and “[[HKD Napredak|Napredak]]”. All those artists like [[Atanasije Popović]], [[Lazar Draljča|Lazar Drljača]], [[Gabrijel Jurkić]], [[Branko Radulović]], [[Petar Šain]] etc., are marked with [[academism]] with slight touches of [[impressionism]], [[art nouveau]], and [[pointillism]]. After the Great Exhibition of Bosnian Artists in 1917, the native born artists have prevailed. Modern styles that entered B&amp;H were [[expressionism]] and [[Cézanne]]s-ism.

==Art in the Yugoslavian Kingdom==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:MIJIC Mountain landscape.jpg|thumb|right|260 px|"Mountain landscape" by Karlo Mijić, 1924.]] --&gt;After the end of [[World War I]], the society of artists from [[Kingdom of SHS|SHS]] (state of Serbians, Croats and Slovenians) was organized and they held numerous exhibitions and artistic gatherings like ''the Blažuj colony'' of [[Vladimir Becić]]. Participants of that colony were [[Roman Petrović]] and [[Jovan Bijelić]] that derived their art to abstract form (c. 1920), while [[Karlo Mijić]] is devoted to colouristic landscapes. Karlo Mijić, with art nouveau and impressionistic influences was probably the best painter of 20s and 30s in the entire [[Yugoslavia]].

Sadly, the art production in B&amp;H was reduced to crumbs by the Yugoslavian government, so lots of artist never returned to B&amp;H from their studies in [[Zagreb]] and [[Beograd]], while many were also leaving the country.
First renewal happened with the ''“Group of Four”'' and ''“engaged art”'' of Roman Petrović and his cycle called ''“The children of the Street”.''
Mijić and ''Đoko Mazalić'' founded the art association called ''“Krug”'' (The Circle) with strong urban aesthetics of nature.
[[Vojo Dimitrijević]] painted ''“Spain in ‘37”''; a representative artwork of colouristic expression with traces of Picasso and Chagall.

In thirties the architects were influenced by ideas of [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]], humane architecture and [[Bauhaus]]. Those buildings were uniting a function, content and form, without unnecessary plastic decoration, and with simple rhythm of windows and modern constructions (former ''Social Security Building'' in Mostar by [[Drago Ibler]], 1935.).

==Art in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia==

Right after [[World War II]], and founding the new country of all south Slavs [[Communist Yugoslavia]], the artist have found new expression through themes of [[Revolution]] and War. Ismet Mujezinović draws numerous expressionistic figures in his cycle ''“The [[Battle of Sutjeska]]”'', and Branko Šotra made powerful almost abstract engravings.
Architecture was also under the direct influence of Socialistic architecture, but never reached the monumentality of the original works.

In the fifties, careful and slow, the transformation of art through economy and decoration toward abstraction happened.  The first was sculptor ''Mirko Ostoja'' who replaced classical modeling with iron welding. Even the Communist State changed its feeling toward modern art by commissioning large abstract monuments dedicated to famous battles in The War ([[Battle of Sutjeska|Sutjeska]], [[Kozara]], Makljen etc.).
Young architects, gathered around professor ''Juraj Neidhardt'', were trying to achieve connections of modern architecture and B&amp;H tradition and surroundings. Those were buildings like The Mostar Mall - ''“Razvitak”'' in 1970 by ''A. Paljaga'' or ''[[Jajce]] Mall'' in 1976 by ''R. Jadrić, Dž. Karić and N. Kurto''.

In the sixties many architects were leaving traditional boundaries and made important buildings in manner of functionalism: The telecommunication building in [[Addis Abeba]] by Ivan Štraus and Zdravko Kovacević, or ''“[[Skenderija]]” Hall'' in Sarajevo by Živorad Janković and Halid Muhasilović&lt;ref&gt;http://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena/course/4/4.175/OldFiles/www/center_home_sarajevo_contemporary.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventies, the rewarded architectural plans were ''[[Zenica]] Theatre'' in 1977 by ''Jahiel Finci'' and ''Zlatko Ugljen'', ''Hotel Rose'' in Mostar (1979, by Zlatko Ugljen) and ''[[Arena Gripe|Gripe Hall]]'' in [[Split (city)|Split]] (1980, by Živorad Janković and S. Rozić).

An art expression inspired by old Bosnian culture and tradition appeared in the [[graphic]] work of Dževad Hozo and in paintings of ''Mehmed Zaimović, Seid Hasanefendić and [[Mersad Berber]]''. Quite opposite to that, the urban expression of ''Ismar Mujezinović'' is more related to modern film montage and [[photo]]-[[optics]], while [[Braco Dimitrijević]] is a [[Conceptual art]]ist who works mainly outside B&amp;H.

An example of architecture in the eighties is ''[[Holiday Inn]] Hotel'' built in 1983 and the ''“Unis” Twin Towers'' built in [[Sarajevo]] in 1986 and designed by [[Ivan Štraus]]. Among the people of the city, the twin towers are commonly called Momo (Serbian name) and Uzeir (Bosniak name).

==Art after the Bosnian War==
[[Image:Sarajevo Twist Tower.jpg|right|thumb|Avaz Twist Tower 2009]]

Cultural preservation is under way in Bosnia and Herzegovina which can be seen with the most recent reconstruction of Stari most in Mostar and many other structures of cultural and historical significance which were damaged or destroyed in the recent war. Many other projects, unfortunately, are still stifled by political disputes and lack of funds.

Commercial construction in the years following the Bosnian War has seen a boom in Sarajevo. Sarajevo is one of the cities with the most construction in southeastern Europe. ''The Unis Twin Towers'' have been renovated completely. On the site of the former ''Oslobodjenje Towers'', ''the Avaz towers'' have now been constructed. In the ''Hrasno'' residential area, the Bosnian Company Bosmal has constructed the [[Bosmal City Center]], which includes the tallest set of twin towers in the Balkans at 120 meters each.

The [[Avaz Twist Tower]] located in Marijin Dvor, Sarajevo is the tallest tower in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is the new headquarters for Avaz, the most popular Bosnia and Herzegovina newspaper company.

Cavender]], who compiled the work under the [[anagrammatic]] [[pen name]] of '''H.C. Decanver'''.&lt;ref name="Catalogue of Works in Refutation of Methodism: Reference 1"/&gt;

A [[reference work]] of [[religious criticism]], the ''Catalogue'' is Decanver's debut publication, and his only written work. It is notable as one of the most prominent writings critical of [[Methodist]] doctrine ever written, and remains the only compilation of books written from a primarily anti-Methodist perspective.

== Background ==

An otherwise virtually unknown individual, the only evidence which suggests that the author Decanver ever existed was the publication of his ''Catalogue'' in 1846. He was self-evidently opposed to the doctrines of [[Methodism]], a branch of [[Protestant Christianity]] which emerged from the teachings of [[John Wesley]] in 18th century England, and in 1846 compiled the catalogue under the full [[title]] of '''''Catalogue of Works in Refutation of Methodism: from its Origin in 1729, to the Present Time: of Those by Methodist Authors on Lay-Representation, Methodist Episcopacy, Etc., Etc., and of the Political Pamphlets Relating to Wesley's "Calm Address to Our American Colonies"'''''.&lt;ref name="Catalogue of Works in Refutation of Methodism: Reference 1"/&gt; The pseudonym "H.C. Decanver" is an anagram of the author's actual name, Curtis H. Cavender.

The book was first published in both hardback and paperback by the presently-defunct [[John Penington (publisher)|John Penington]] publishing company, once located on 10 South Fifth Street in eastern [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="Catalogue of Works in Refutation of Methodism: Reference 3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.hsp.org/collections/manuscripts/p/penington1435.htm |title=Penington Family Papers, The Historical Society of Pennsylvania |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |month= |year= |work= |publisher=The Historical Society of Pennsylvania |location=Philadelphia |page= |pages= |at= |trans-title=|doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=3 April 2010 |quote=The eldest of the children of Edward and Sarah Shoemaker Penington, John, devoted his professional life to the literary pursuits his father favored. Born on August 1, 1799, John Penington was the proprietor of a well-known Philadelphia bookshop at '''10 South Fifth Street''', specializing in international trade, rare books, and classical texts both in their original languages and in translation. |ref= |separator= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original printings were attributed to an individual "C. Sherman, printer" from 19 St. James Street in the same city.&lt;ref name="Catalogue of Works in Refutation of Methodism: Reference 1"/&gt;

There are several editions of the book, some including minor changes deviating from former editions.

The catalogue as a whole lists over 100 individual documents, books, pamphlets and articles — many of which today are regarded as historical texts. As a whole the works listed assumedly refute certain doctrines of Methodist thought, although – if somewhat ironically – many of them are by Methodist authors themselves.

== Contents ==

The book is divided into two sections, the first being a [[preface]]                    entitled either "Prefatory Remarks" or "Preliminary Remarks", depending upon the edition of the book (the first edition of the work was printed containing the latter title), and the second being the catalogue proper – in all editions simply deemed "Catalogue". The Catalogue section is itself divided further, the first group of works representing those called "Anti-Methodistical", the second group listed under "Methodist Authors" (being by Methodist authors themselves), the third called "Miscellaneous", and the last group listed as "Political".

'''''Confluence''''' is a [[land art]] [[sculpture]] by artists [[Robert Stackhouse]] and [[Carol Mickett]]. The work sits on the grounds of the [[Indianapolis Art Center]] located in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], [[United States]]. ''Confluence'' was installed as part of the Art Center's ARTSPARK initiative.&lt;ref name="ARTSPARKMap"&gt;{{cite web | author=Indianapolis Art Center | year= | title=Indianapolis Art Center Map | work=Artspark | publisher=Indianapolis Art Center | url=http://www.indplsartcenter.org/userfiles/File//ARTSPARK_Map.pdf | accessdate=4 April 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926223153/http://indplsartcenter.org/userfiles/File//ARTSPARK_Map.pdf | archivedate=26 September 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

''Confluence'' consists of 100 tons of [[Indiana limestone]] cascading in height in a 70-foot [[boat]]-like shape.&lt;ref name="IndianapolisSportsTravel"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=| title=Broad Ripple Village | work=Artspark | publisher=Indianapolis Sports &amp; Travel | url=http://indianapolis-sports-travel.com/broad-ripple-village/ | accessdate= 4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndianapolisWoman"&gt;{{cite web | author=Danison, Joy &amp; Sarah Preuschl | year= | title=Stone Souls | work=Cover Gallery | publisher=Indianapolis Woman | url=http://www.indianapoliswoman.com/archive.asp?r=\2004\aug\departments\artsculture\arts-culture1.txt | accessdate= 4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="artAttack"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2007 |title=Art Attack. |journal=Parks &amp; Recreation |volume=42 |issue=8 |pages=76 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=26159470&amp;site=ehost-live |accessdate=5 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second part of the artwork lies along the White River, further into the ARTSPARK.&lt;ref name="ARTSPARKMap"/&gt; Words are chiseled into the vertical stones with one statement reading "My soul has grown deep like the rivers."&lt;ref name="IndianapolisWoman"/&gt;

==Creation==

Stackhouse and Mickett created the piece in residency at the Art Center during the summer of 2004.&lt;ref name="Nuvo"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2004 | title=Q&amp;A with Dave Thomas  | work=Arts | publisher=Nuvo Newsweekly | url=http://www.nuvo.net/gyrobase/qanda-with-dave-thomas/Content?oid=1203992 | accessdate= 4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation utilized motorized [[chisel]]s, gas-powered [[saw]]s and hammers to create the columns. Stackhouse oversaw the work on the vertical stones and Mickett handled the arranging of the bases. Visitors to the Art Center were encouraged to participate by being allowed to don goggles, dust masks and gloves to contribute to the creation process. This unique opportunity to participate in the creation process was described by Art Center vice president and programming director David Thomas as being "...such a great chance to connect with people in a meaningful way, to see how an artist like this thinks and works".&lt;ref name="IndianapolisWoman"/&gt;

This piece was the first installation acquired for the Art Center's ARTSPARK which, designed by [[Michael Graves]], brings together art and nature.&lt;ref name="ARTSPARKMap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IndianapolisWoman"/&gt; The artwork was a gift from Michael and Mary Ann Browning.&lt;ref name="ARTSPARKMap"/&gt;

==Information==

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The mission of the Indianapolis Art Center is to engage, enlighten, and inspire our community by providing interactive art education, outreach to underserved audiences, support of artists, and exposure to the visual arts.'' - Indianapolis Art Center Mission Statement&lt;ref name="Mission"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2010 | title=Mission | work=The Center | publisher=Indianapolis Art Center | url=http://www.indplsartcenter.org/About_Us/The_Center/Mission/ | accessdate=4 April 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110620101658/http://indplsartcenter.org/About_Us/The_Center/Mission/ | archivedate=20 June 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Stackhouse and Mickett aimed to create an artwork that integrated "the center's mission, to make it part of its place." ''Confluence'' also seeks to represent journeying, unity and the Art Center's relationship and placement on with the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]]. The words chiseled into the stones tell stories of these subjects with some being inspired by [[Langston Hughes]]' poem "[[The Negro Speaks of Rivers]]."&lt;ref name="IndianapolisWoman"/&gt;

'''documenta 14''' is the fourteenth edition of the art exhibition [[documenta]] and took place in 2017 in both [[Kassel]], [[Germany]], its traditional home, and [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. It is being held first in Athens from 8 April till 16 July,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.documenta14.de/en/ |title= documenta 14 |publisher= South Magazine |accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Kassel from 10 June till 17 September 2017. As part of the concept of the artistic director [[Adam Szymczyk]], the exhibition is proceeding in both countries. Most featured artists are working at both locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/streit-in-kassel-die-documenta-soll-nun-auch-nach-athen-13199214.html |title= In Athen den Süden suchen |publisher=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|author= Niklas Maak | date= 2014-10-09 |accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documenta is a series of [[contemporary art]] exhibitions. It takes place every five years (originally every four years) and lasts 100 days each; It is therefore also referred to as a museum of 100 days. The first documenta was organized in 1955 and went back to the initiative of [[Arnold Bode]]. The location of the Documenta is normally [[Kassel]].

The '''enfield''' is a fictitious creature sometimes used in [[heraldry]].

==Description==
The Enfield has the head of a fox, forelegs like an [[eagle (heraldry)|eagle]]'s talons, {{citation needed span|text=the chest of a [[greyhound]], the body of a [[lion (heraldry)|lion]]|date=May 2018|reason=These two animals are not referenced in text on this page quoted from the same source.}}, and the hindquarters and tail of a [[wolves in heraldry|wolf]].&lt;ref name="ulsterking"/&gt;

==O'Kelly==
The earliest known example of the enfield is the [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the [[Kelly (surname)|Ó Cellaigh]] clan of Ireland. Ó Cellaigh of [[Uí Maine]] are the most documented O'Kelly sept in early Irish history and annals. The enfield appears in ''[[Leabhar Ua Maine]]''.

The ancient tradition among the O'Kellys is that they have borne this fabulous animal since the days of King [[Tadhg Mór Ua Cellaigh]] who fell "fighting like a wolf dog" on the side of the High King of Ireland, [[Brian Boru]], at the [[Battle of Clontarf]] in 1014.  When Tadhg Mor fell this mythical beast issued from the nearby sea to protect the dead body of the chief until it was retrieved for proper burial by his kinsmen.

The animal is sculptured on many old ({{circa|1375}}&amp;ndash;1650) tombstones of the O'Kelly family in the Abbey of [[Kilconnell]] (founded ca.&amp;thinsp;1353 by King [[William Buidhe Ó Cellaigh]]), and in the old church of Cloonkeen.

In 1859, an excavation project found a bronze 15th century O'Kelly seal 20&amp;nbsp;ft deep in a bog, prompting considerable research on the origins of the O'Kelly enfield on the seal:

{{quote|I have searched in several works  on heraldry for a description of the enfield, but without success. It does not appear to be a cognizance of much in use, and it does not appear to be found in [[John Guillim|Gwillam]]'s "Display of Heraldry" folio: not even in Cap 26 of that book, which chapter treats solely of fictitious creatures, supposed to be compounded of different kinds and natures, such as [[Griffon]]s, [[Wivern]]s, [[dragon]]s, [[cockatrice]]s, [[harpy|harpies]], [[mermaid]]s. Neither is the term enfield given or explained in Crossley's "Signification of things borne in Heraldry". To my gifted friend, Sir [[Bernard Burke]], [[Ulster King of Arms]], I, however am indebted for the following definition of this composite fabulous creature, viz. :— "The Enfield is a heraldic animal, having the head of a fox, the breast feathered as an eagle's, the foreclaws also of an eagle; the remainder of the body that of a wolf." It follows from such description that the enfield, being compounded of the fox, eagle, and wolf, indicated that he, by whom it was borne, was reputed to possess the subtlety and cunning of the first named beast; the magnanimity and fortitude, with the honour, labor, industry, and diligence, in great manners, of the eagle; and the fierceness of the wolf.&lt;ref name="ulsterking"&gt;''The Journal of the Kilkenny and southeast of Ireland archaeological society'', Vol II, 1858&amp;ndash;1859, Dublin, University Press, McGlashan &amp; Gill, p448&amp;ndash;449.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Modern uses==
The beast was on the coat of arms of the [[Municipal Borough of Enfield]], which was amalgamated with the [[Municipal Borough of Edmonton]] and the [[Municipal Borough of Southgate]] to form the [[London Borough of Enfield]]. It is unclear whether the beast has any historic connection with the town, but it still makes a striking example of [[canting arms]]. It is used on the modern [[coat of arms of the London Borough of Enfield]] and as an emblem by some organisations there: for example, on the badges of Enfield County School, [[Chace Community School]], Enfield Ignatians R.F.C. and of the football clubs [[Enfield (1893) F.C.]] and [[Enfield Town F.C.]], as well as [[Oneida FC]].

In Australia, it was used in the crest of the former [[City of Enfield]], [[South Australia]] (which was named after the London borough), and is still used by the Enfield Brass Band.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.enfieldbrass.org.au/contact |title=Enfield Brass: Contact |accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as the centrepiece of the squadron crest of [[No. 38 Squadron RAAF|38 Squadron]] of the Royal Australian Air Force, in [[Queensland]].

==Properties==

The proposed megastructure would incorporate all of Earth's matter. Sunlight would enter through two large windows, and [[gravity]] would be simulated by the [[centrifugal effect]]. Humans would live on two vast regions that face each other and that are connected through the empty center. The [[hydrosphere]] and [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] would be retained on its inside. The ecosphere would be restricted to the [[equator]]ial zones, while at the low-gravity [[Tropics|tropic]] zones a thin atmosphere would allow only for plantations. The [[polar region]]s would have neither gravity nor atmosphere and would therefore be used for storage of raw materials and microgravity production processes.

===Geometric structure===
Globus Cassus has the [[shape|form]] of a compressed [[geodesic dome|geodesic]] [[icosahedron]] with two diagonal openings. Along the edges of the icosahedron run the skeleton beams, the gaps between the beams contain a shell and, where there are windows, inward-curving domes.

===Building material===
Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]], [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] and [[Planetary core|core]] are gradually excavated, transported outwards and then transformed to larger strength and reduced density. While the crust is mined from open pits in the continents' centers, [[magma]] and the liquid mantle are pumped across transfer hoses. The core is dismantled from the surface.

===Planetary scale===
Since the stationary cables would stay clear inside the [[moon]]'s trajectory, the construction of Globus Cassus would not alter the Earth-Moon system. However, on a planetary scale the proportions would be altered, with Globus Cassus being only slightly smaller than [[Saturn]], the [[Solar System|Solar System's]] second-largest planet.

==Construction process==
Starting at four precisely defined points in the [[geostationary orbit]], four [[space elevators]] are built. Eventually they become massive towers, each measuring several hundred kilometers in diameter and extending to a length of about 165,000&amp;nbsp;km. The towers contain elevators which are used to transport silicate building material to the construction sites at geostationary orbit.

===Skeleton and shell===
The building material is converted into vacuum-porous aggregate and used to form the skeleton. It is built retaining constant [[symmetry]] and balance at every moment and will ultimately span around all sides of the earth. Then [[magma]] is pumped towards the skeleton, where it is used to form thin shells in the skeletal openings. Eight of these openings are fitted with large, inward-curving window domes made out of silicon glass.

===The Great Rains===
Having been used up to a large degree, the Earth has shrunk, the polar ice caps have melted and the Earth's mass and therefore [[gravity]] has declined. This leads to the sudden loss of the [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] and [[hydrosphere]], which wander outwards towards the new World. Globus Cassus' equator zones are equipped with a system of trenches and moulds that will become [[river]]s, [[lake]]s and [[sea]]s as soon as the water has settled. The transfer process of atmosphere and hydrosphere is called "The Great Rains".

===Colonization===
The moment the Great Rains start, the Earth becomes uninhabitable. Along with massive amounts of seed for all existing plants, the regions of high cultural value, that need to be conserved and reapplied on Globus Cassus have been stored in the skeleton nodes which touch the towers. Humans and animals rise in the towers to await the end of the rains and start settling on the two equator regions.

===Plant growth===
The remaining Earth core is dismantled to build the shells that lie in the pole regions. During this process, the massive heat radiation of the core accelerates plant growth and therefore aids the process of establishing a functioning [[biosphere]].

A '''greensman''' or '''greensperson''' or '''greenskeeper''' is any production personnel on a film set who is responsible for obtaining and taking care of anything "green" or natural used in the film production. This may include plants, grass, trees, flowers, and other various [[landscaping]] materials like rocks, gravel, sand, etc. She or he is considered part of the [[art department]]. This includes artificial forms of these materials such as simulated rocks and items representing greens, such as camouflage netting. 

The greensperson functions as a participant in the [[filmmaking]] process as an extension of the art department during set construction and in conjunction with the camera department during filming. Greens work is generally considered to be one of the dirtiest, most thankless, and physically demanding job in set construction. In addition to set construction, greenspeople often work "on set" assisting the camera team and other departments in adjusting the set to the changing demands of different camera positions and lighting setups, as requested by the creative leaders. The range of duties in this category ranges from tending to plant nursery operations (watering, fertilizing, transplanting grass, flowers, bushes, etc.) through to the artful crafting of vines, trees, flowers and the like using cut living material and/or various simulated materials.

'''John Zerzan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|ɜr|z|ə|n}} {{respell|ZUR|zən}}; born August 10, 1943) is an American [[anarchism|anarchist]] and [[anarcho-primitivism|primitivist]] philosopher and author. His works criticize agricultural [[civilization]] as inherently oppressive, and advocate drawing upon the ways of life of [[hunter-gatherer]]s as an inspiration for what a free society should look like. Some subjects of his criticism include [[domestication]], [[language]], [[Anarcho-primitivism#Critique of symbolic culture|symbolic thought]] (such as [[mathematics]] and [[art]]) and the concept of time.

His six major books are ''Elements of Refusal'' (1988), ''[[Future Primitive and Other Essays]]'' (1994), ''Running on Emptiness'' (2002), ''[[Against Civilization: Readings and Reflections]]'' (2005), ''Twilight of the Machines'' (2008), and ''Why hope? The Stand Against Civilization'' (2015).

{{Green anarchism| People}}

==Early life and education==
Zerzan was born in [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]], Oregon. He received his bachelor's degree from [[Stanford University]] and later received a master's degree in History from [[San Francisco State University]]. He completed his coursework towards a PhD at the [[University of Southern California]] but dropped out before completing his [[Thesis|dissertation]]. He is of [[Czechs|Czech]] descent.

==Zerzan's anarchism==
{{Anarchism sidebar}}
Zerzan's theories draw on [[Theodor Adorno]]'s concept of [[Negative Dialectics|negative dialectics]] to construct a theory of [[civilization]] as the cumulative construction of [[social alienation|alienation]].  According to Zerzan, original human societies in [[paleolithic]] times, and similar societies today such as the [[!Kung people|!Kung]] and [[Mbuti]], live a non-alienated and non-oppressive form of life based on [[Original Affluent Society|primitive abundance]] and closeness to nature. Constructing such societies as an instructive comparison against which to denounce contemporary (especially industrial) societies, Zerzan uses [[anthropology|anthropological]] studies from such societies as the basis for a wide-ranging critique of aspects of modern life. He portrays contemporary society as a world of misery built on the [[psychology|psychological]] production of a sense of scarcity and lack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/massmisery.htm John Zerzan – The Mass Psychology of Misery] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323052844/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/massmisery.htm |date=March 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of civilization is the history of renunciation; what stands against this is not progress but rather the [[Utopia]] which arises from its negation.&lt;ref name=WhyPrimitivism&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whyprim.htm John Zerzan – Why Primitivism?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214075548/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whyprim.htm |date=December 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zerzan is an anarchist philosopher, and is broadly associated with the philosophies of [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[green anarchism]], anti-civilisation, [[post-left anarchy]], [[Neo-Luddism|neo-luddism]], and in particular the [[critique of technology]].&lt;ref name=GUARDIAN&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,475181,00.html John Zerzan] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He rejects not only the state, but all forms of hierarchical and authoritarian relations.  "Most simply, anarchy means 'without rule.' This implies not only a rejection of government but of all other forms of domination and power as well."&lt;ref name=WhatIsAnarchism&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whatisanarchism.htm John Zerzan – What is Anarchism?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618101213/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whatisanarchism.htm |date=June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zerzan's work relies heavily on a strong dualism between the "primitive" – viewed as non-alienated, wild, non-hierarchical, ludic, and socially [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] – and the "civilised" – viewed as alienated, domesticated, hierarchically organised and socially discriminatory. Hence, "life before domestication/agriculture was in fact largely one of leisure, intimacy with nature, sensual wisdom, sexual equality, and health."&lt;ref name=FuturePrimitive&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primitivism.com/future-primitive.htm |title=John Zerzan – Future Primitive |publisher=Primitivism.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zerzan's claims about the status of primitive societies are based on a certain reading of the works of anthropologists such as [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[Richard Borshay Lee|Richard B. Lee]]. Crucially, the category of primitives is restricted to pure hunter-gatherer societies with no domesticated plants or animals. For instance, hierarchy among Northwest Coast Native Americans whose main activities were fishing and foraging is attributed to their having domesticated dogs and tobacco.&lt;ref name=FuturePrimitive/&gt;&lt;ref name = RunningOnEmptiness/&gt;

Zerzan calls for a "Future Primitive", a radical reconstruction of society based on a rejection of alienation and an embracing of the wild.  "It may be that our only real hope is the recovery of a face-to-face social existence, a radical [[decentralization]], a dismantling of the devouring, estranging productionist, high-tech trajectory that is so impoverishing."&lt;ref name=WhatIsAnarchism/&gt; The usual use of anthropological evidence is comparative and demonstrative – the necessity or naturality of aspects of modern western societies is challenged by pointing to counter-examples in hunter-gatherer societies.  "Ever-growing documentation of human prehistory as a very long period of largely non-alienated life stands in sharp contrast to the increasingly stark failures of untenable modernity."&lt;ref name=WhyPrimitivism/&gt; It is unclear, however, whether this implies a re-establishment of the literal forms of hunter-gatherer societies or a broader kind of learning from their ways of life in order to construct non-alienated relations.

Zerzan's political project calls for the destruction of technology.  He draws the same distinction as [[Ivan Illich]], between tools that stay under the control of the user, and technological systems that draw the user into their control.  One difference is the [[division of labour]], which Zerzan opposes. In Zerzan's philosophy, technology is possessed by an [[elite]] which automatically has power over other users; this power is one of the sources of alienation, along with [[domestication]] and [[symbol]]ic thought.

Zerzan's typical method is to take a particular construct of civilisation (a technology, belief, practice or institution) and construct an account of its historical origins, what he calls its destructive and alienating effects and its contrasts with hunter-gatherer experiences.  In his essay on number, for example, Zerzan starts by contrasting the "civilized" emphasis on counting and measuring with a "primitive" emphasis on sharing, citing [[Dorothy D. Lee|Dorothy Lee]]'s work on the [[Trobriand Islands|Trobriand Islanders]] in support, before constructing a narrative of the rise of number through cumulative stages of state domination, starting with the desire of [[Egypt]]ian kings to measure what they ruled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/number.htm John Zerzan – Number: Its Origin and Evolution] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618100924/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/number.htm |date=June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach is repeated in relation to time,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/time.htm John Zerzan – Time and its Discontents] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618101958/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/time.htm |date=June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; gender inequality,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/patriarchy.htm John Zerzan – Patriarchy, Civilization, and the Origins of Gender] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206011455/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/patriarchy.htm |date=February 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; work,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/organisedlabour.htm John Zerzan – Organized Labor versus "The Revolt Against Work"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618101748/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/organisedlabour.htm |date=June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; technology,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/technology.htm John Zerzan – Technology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618101934/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/technology.htm |date=June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; art and ritual,&lt;ref name=RunningOnEmptiness&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primitivism.com/emptiness.htm |title=John Zerzan – Running on Emptiness: The Failure of Symbolic Thought |publisher=Primitivism.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; agriculture&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/agriculture.htm John Zerzan – Agriculture] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831022318/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/agriculture.htm |date=August 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and globalization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/globalization.htm John Zerzan – Globalization and its Apologists: An Abolitionist Perspective] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206011133/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/globalization.htm |date=February 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zerzan also writes more general texts on anarchist,&lt;ref name=WhatIsAnarchism/&gt; primitivist theory,&lt;ref name=WhyPrimitivism/&gt;&lt;ref name=FuturePrimitive/&gt; and critiques of "[[postmodernism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100618100950/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/pmanarchist.htm John Zerzan – "Hakim Bey," Postmodern Anarchist]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zerzan was one of the editors of ''[[Green Anarchy]]'', a controversial journal of anarcho-primitivist and [[insurrectionary anarchist]] thought. He is also the host of ''Anarchy Radio'' in Eugene on the [[University of Oregon]]'s radio station [[KWVA]]. He has also served as a contributing editor at ''[[Anarchy Magazine]]'' and has been published in magazines such as ''[[AdBusters]]''. He does extensive speaking tours around the world, and is married to an independent consultant to museums and other [[nonprofit organization]]s.

==Political development==
In 1966, Zerzan was arrested while performing [[civil disobedience]] at a [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] anti-[[Vietnam War]] march and spent two weeks in the [[Contra Costa County]] [[county jail|Jail]]. He vowed after his release never again to be willingly arrested. He attended events organized by [[Ken Kesey]] and the [[Merry Pranksters]] and was involved with the [[psychedelic drug]] and [[psychedelic music|music]] scene in San Francisco's [[Haight-Ashbury]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/18/mayday.features11 |title=Profile of American anarchist John Zerzan &amp;#124; World news |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |date=April 20, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s he worked as a [[social worker]] for the city of San Francisco [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] department. He helped organize a social worker's [[trade union|union]], the SSEU, and was elected vice president in 1968, and president in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shapingsf.org/ezine/labor/nopaid/main.html History of the union] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828045251/http://www.shapingsf.org/ezine/labor/nopaid/main.html |date=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The local [[Situationist International|Situationist]] group Contradiction denounced him as a "[[leftist]] [[bureaucracy|bureaucrat]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contradiction |url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/PH/zerzan.htm |title=Open Letter to John Zerzan, anti-bureaucrat of the San Francisco Social Services Employees Union |publisher=Bopsecrets.org |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Black and Red Press published ''Unions Against Revolution'' by Spanish [[ultra-left]] theorist [[Grandizo Munis]] that included an essay by Zerzan which previously appeared in the journal ''[[Telos (journal)|Telos]]''.  Over the next 20 years, Zerzan became intimately involved with the ''[[Fifth Estate (periodical)|Fifth Estate]]'', ''[[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]]'', ''Demolition Derby '' and other anarchist periodicals. He began to question civilization in the early 80's, after having sought to confront issues around the neutrality of technology and division of labour, at the time when [[Fredy Perlman]] was making similar conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corrupt.org/act/interviews/john_zerzan |title=Interview: Anarcho-Primitivist Thinker and Activist John Zerzan &amp;#124; CORRUPT.org: Conservation &amp; Conservatism |publisher=CORRUPT.org |date=December 7, 2008 |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002121547/http://www.corrupt.org/act/interviews/john_zerzan |archivedate=October 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw civilization itself as the root of the problems of the world and that a hunter-gatherer form of society presented the most [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian model]] for human relations with themselves and the natural world.

==Zerzan and the "Unabomber"==
In the mid-1990s, Zerzan became a confidant to [[Theodore Kaczynski]], the "Unabomber", after he read ''Industrial Society and Its Future'', the so-called ''Unabomber Manifesto.''  Zerzan sat through the Unabomber trial and often conversed with Kaczynski during the proceedings.  After Zerzan became known as a friend of the Unabomber, the mainstream media became interested in Zerzan and his ideas.

On May 7, 1995, a full-page interview with Zerzan was featured in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE3DD113FF934A35756C0A963958260 Prominent Anarchist Finds Unsought Ally in Serial Bomber] (New York Times article)&lt;/ref&gt; In Zerzan's essay "Whose Unabomber?" (1995), he signaled his support for the Kaczynski doctrine, but criticised the bombings:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he mailing of explosive devices intended for the agents who are engineering the present catastrophe is too random. Children, mail carriers, and others could easily be killed. Even if one granted the legitimacy of striking at the high-tech horror show by terrorizing its indispensable architects, collateral harm is not justifiable ...&lt;ref name=WhoseUnabomber&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whoseunabomber.htm John Zerzan – Whose Unabomber?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618101228/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whoseunabomber.htm |date=June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Zerzan in the same essay offered a qualified defense of the Unabomber's actions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The concept of justice should not be overlooked in considering the Unabomber phenomenon. In fact, except for his targets, when have the many [[little Eichmanns]] who are preparing the [[Brave New World]] ever been called to account?... Is it unethical to try to stop those whose contributions are bringing an unprecedented assault on life?&lt;ref name=WhoseUnabomber/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two years later, in the 1997 essay "He Means It&amp;nbsp;— Do You?," Zerzan wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Enter the Unabomber and a new line is being drawn. This time the bohemian schiz-fluxers, Green yuppies, hobbyist anarcho-journalists, condescending organizers of the poor, hip nihilo-aesthetes and all the other "anarchists" who thought their pretentious pastimes would go on unchallenged indefinitely&amp;nbsp;— well, it's time to pick which side you're on. It may be that here also is a [[Crossing the Rubicon|Rubicon]] from which there will be no turning back.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2001 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Will there be other Kaczynskis? I hope not. I think that activity came out of isolation and desperation, and I hope that isn't going to be something that people feel they have to take up because they have no other way to express their opposition to the brave new world.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2014 interview Zerzan stated that he and Kaczynski were "not on terms anymore." He criticized his former friend's 2008 essay "[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ted-kaczynski-the-truth-about-primitive-life-a-critique-of-anarchoprimitivism The Truth About Primitive Life: A Critique of Anarchoprimitivism]" and expressed disapproval of [[Individuals Tending Towards the Savage|Individuals Tending Towards the Wild]], a Mexican group influenced by the Unabomber's bombing campaign.&lt;ref name="vice.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/read/john-zerzan-wants-us-to-give-up-all-of-our-technology |title=The Anarcho-Primitivist Who Wants Us All To Give Up Technology |work=Vice Media Inc |location=USA |accessdate=June 26, 2014 |date=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zerzan and the Eugene Anarchist Scene==
{{see also|1999 Seattle WTO protests}}
Zerzan was associated with the [[Eugene, Oregon anarchist scene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2006/11/22/coverstory.html|title=Part. III: Eco-Anarchy Imploding|newspaper=[[Eugene Weekly]]|date=November 22, 2006|accessdate=September 1, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403004049/http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2006/11/22/coverstory.html|archive-date=April 3, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism: history, catastrophe and anarchism==
In his essay "Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm", [[Murray Bookchin]] directed criticism from an anarchist point of view at Zerzan's anti-civilizational and anti-technological perspective. He argued that Zerzan's representation of hunter-gatherers was flawed, selective and often patronisingly racist, that his analysis was superficial, and that his practical proposals were nonsensical.

Aside from Murray Bookchin, several other anarchist critiques of Zerzan's primitivist philosophies exist. The pamphlet, "Anarchism vs. Primitivism" by Brian Oliver Sheppard criticizes many aspects of the primitivist philosophy.&lt;ref name="Libcom.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/anarchism-vs-primitivism |title=Anarchism vs. Primitivism by Brian Oliver Sheppard |publisher=Libcom.org |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It specifically rejects the claim that primitivism is a form of anarchism.

Some authors, such as Andrew Flood, have argued that destroying civilization would lead to the death of a significant majority of the population, mainly in poor countries.&lt;ref name="Anarkismo.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1451 |title=Civilization, Primitivism, Anarchism by Andrew Flood |publisher=Anarkismo.net |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Zerzan responded to such claims by suggesting a gradual decrease in population size, with the possibility of people having the need to seek means of sustainability more close to nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/fp.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910091422/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/fp.htm |date=September 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flood suggests this contradicts Zerzan's claims elsewhere, and adds that, since it is certain that most people will strongly reject Zerzan's supposed utopia, it can only be implemented by authoritarian means, against the will of billions.&lt;ref name="Anarkismo.net"/&gt;

In his essay "Listen Anarchist!", Chaz Bufe criticized the primitivist position from an anarchist perspective, pointing out that primitivists are extremely vague about exactly which technologies they advocate keeping and which they seek to abolish, noting that smallpox had been eradicated thanks to medical technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.seesharppress.com/listen.html| author=Chaz Bufe| title=Listen Anarchist!| publisher=See Sharp Press| year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodore J. Kaczynski]], better known as the [[Unabomber]], is a surprisingly harsh critic of the current Anarcho-Primitivist mainstream and Zerzan in particular for what he sees as a foolish and invalid projection of leftist values such as gender equality, pacifism and leisure time onto the primitive way of life. Kaczynski holds that the values of gender equality, pacifism, leisure time, etc., while still admirable, are exactly the values of techno-industrial civilization and its promised techno-utopia. Second, he holds that having such an interpretation is counter-productive to the ultimate anti-civilization/anti-tech goal as it attracts "leftist types" who are by nature uncommitted and act to dilute the movement.  Kaczynski insists that the core values of freedom, autonomy, dignity, and human fulfillment must be emphasized above all others.&lt;ref&gt;Technological Slavery: The collected writings of Theodore J. Kaczynski, pp. 128–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LED art''' is a form of [[light art]] constructed from [[light-emitting diode]]s. [[LED]]s (light emitting diodes) are very inexpensive to purchase and have become a new way to make street art. Many artists who use LEDs are [[guerrilla artist]]s, incorporating LEDs to produce temporary pieces in public places. LEDs may be used in installation art, sculptural pieces and interactive artworks.

== Infamous LED art==
{{See also|2007 Boston bomb scare}}
In early 2007, there was a bomb scare in [[Boston]], Massachusetts in the United States caused by a [[guerrilla marketing]] campaign. An advertising firm working for [[Cartoon Network]] to promote the network's animated television show ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', hired two artists to produce art for the ad campaign. The artists placed LED signs in various locations across ten cities. However, Boston was the only city that reacted by shutting down bridges and bringing in bomb squads to remove the LEDs. The majority of the light boards were removed and the artists were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/01/31/boston.bombscare/index.html | work=CNN | title=Two held after ad campaign triggers Boston bomb scare - CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/specials/local/cartoon_devices/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Boston bomb scare - Cartoon Network devices - Turner ad campaign - Boston Globe | date=2007-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartoon Network general manager [[Jim Samples]] resigned as a result of the incident.

== LED throwies==
[[File:LED throwies chaos.jpg|thumb|right|LED throwies]]
An LED throwie is a small LED attached to a [[watch battery|coin battery]] and a [[rare earth magnet]] (usually with conductive [[epoxy]] or [[electrical tape]]), used for the purpose of creating non-destructive [[graffiti]] and light displays. Artists throw individual LEDs onto a metallic object, like public sculpture or road infrastructure, which itself acts as a canvas. LED throwies were invented in 2006 by the artists [[Evan Roth]] and [[James Powderly]], the founder of Graffiti Research Lab&lt;ref name="GRL"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Graffiti Research Lab  | title = LED Throwies  | url=http://www.graffitiresearchlab.com/  | accessdate = 2013-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Eyebeam Atelier]] open lab [[New York City]]. After Graffiti Research Lab posted the instructions how to make a throwie on [[Instructables]],&lt;ref name="GRL" /&gt; throwies went viral on the Internet and could be found in advertising, were for sale as DIY kits or further developed by other artists and hackers worldwide.

==Blinkies==
[[Image:Blinky novelty.gif|472px|thumb|Animations of various blinkies]]
Blinkies are small electronic devices that make very bright (usually flashing) light using LEDs and small batteries. They are often sold by vendors at night-time events that have fireworks displays such as [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], [[Canada Day]], or [[Guy Fawkes Night]]. They are also popular at [[rave]]s, New Year's Eve parties and nighttime sporting events.

There is no industry standard or official name for blinkies, but most common names use some combination of the terms flash, magnet, strobe, body, blink, light, and/or jewelry. Common examples are blinkies, blinkees, body lights, blinky body lights, magnetic flashers, or flashing jewelry.

=== Uses ===
Blinkies are most often used for amusement at raves, parties and nighttime events. Their other uses include:
* Blinkies imprinted with company logos at conventions
* Safety lights for children during Halloween, or nighttime events
* Fun and safety during camping trips
* Emergency flashers for disabled automobiles or lost hikers (most blinkies have over a one-mile visibility range at night)
* The term blinky is often used for bicycle lights which flash. In some countries, blinkies can be used as a primary light on a bicycle.
* Blinkies also can be attached to mobiles (cell phones). When the mobile turns on, makes a call, or receives a call, the blinky will keep flashing.
* "Winky blinkies" can refer to stage and film props which display lighting effects, or "gags," during a dramatic production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.racprops.com/issue7/coyle_interview/ |title=Richard A. Coyle Interview |author=Thomas Vaccina |work=RACprops Issue 7 |publisher=RACprops.com |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction ===

====Body====
A typical blinky is a small metal two-piece cylinder wide enough to accept a button cell battery with a small etched circuit board on the face and threads on the open end, paired with a cylinder cap which screws on to seal and secure as one. The flashing LED circuit board face can be round and enclosed by the cylinder, or a variety larger colored shapes such as logos that are glued to the outside face of the cylinder end. Common designs utilize a rubber ring gasket as an on/off switch. When placed between the batteries and circuit board inside the front cover, tightening the screw base deforms and flattens the gasket forcing the battery tip to contact the back of the printed circuit board, which completes the circuit.

====Back ====
The most common designs use a set of strong magnets, one at the back of the blinky, and another that can be removed. This allows the light to be easily attached to clothes, or stuck onto any magnetic metal such as buttons or belt buckles. Clips are often used to make earrings, a loop can make a pendant, or a ring can be welded to the back to make a finger ring. Double sided adhesive pads are sometimes used to stick the blinky directly to the body, most often in the navel.

====Circuit board ====
The circuit board typically has anywhere from 2 to as many as 25 micro-LEDs. LEDs that emit different [[Light-emitting diode#Colors and materials|colors]] within the visible spectrum are commonly used, whereas ultraviolet or infrared LEDs are less common in blinkies. Blue, white, violet, and ultra-violet LEDs often require two or more battery cells, due to their higher voltage requirements. The visible side of the etched circuit board can be constructed to flash in a variety of ways, especially where there are multiple LEDs in multiple colours. A clear plastic [[conformal coating]] material such as silicone, acrylic or epoxy protects the fragile LEDs on the exposed front of the board. Shaped boards have literally hundreds of variations combined with imprinting. Common shapes (besides the classic small circle) are stars, hearts, flowers, flags, animals, holiday symbols (like [[Halloween]] [[jack-o-lantern]]s), and sports team logos.

The '''Lollybot Collective''' is a multimedia [[art collective]] founded in [[Detroit, MI]].&lt;ref&gt;The Arts - Do-It-Yourself: The Lollybot Collective&lt;{{cite web |url=http://thedetroiter.com/b2evoArt/blogs/index.php?blog=2&amp;c=1&amp;more=1&amp;pb=1&amp;tb=1&amp;title=do_it_yourself_the_lollybot_collective |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828131134/http://thedetroiter.com/b2evoArt/blogs/index.php?blog=2&amp;title=do_it_yourself_the_lollybot_collective&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1 |archivedate=2008-08-28 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The collective is made up of over fifty artists dedicated to positive change in a fun environment. Their gallery shows are well known for their laid back atmosphere, live shows and cheap beer. The collective is non-profit, all money is used to support the continuation of the artists' galleries and music. They do not take an independent commission from sold art pieces.

Interaction between the audience and the art is highly encouraged. In their first show about accidents, an artist Curt Greene created a balanced sculpture that would fall apart if touched. In their second show "Feedback" the walls of the gallery were lined with brown paper allowing the audience to write responses to the art on the wall. This notion was used again in their third show "Restrictions". Video has also been used as a way to interact with art, at "Restrictions" there was a camera placed outside the bathroom that fed into a TV placed in the bathroom so that the person inside could see the line outside the bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;Alarm Press Magazine Spotlight &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alarmpress.com/7535/music-interview/diy-venue-spotlight-the-lollybot-collective/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215184232/http://www.alarmpress.com/7535/music-interview/diy-venue-spotlight-the-lollybot-collective/ |archivedate=2009-02-15 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The collective was founded in 2007 by college friends Matthew Pritchard and Jeff Nolan who were attending The [[College for Creative Studies]] in Detroit.

==Key Members==

There is no set membership in the collective, artists participate in the collective's shows on a revolving door basis. Yet there are many key members who have participated with the collective since its conception and are main supporters.

The furniture of the [[Louis XV]] period (1715-1774) is characterized by curved forms, lightness, comfort and asymmetry; it replaced the more formal, boxlike  and massive furniture of the [[Style Louis XIV]]. It employed [[marquetry]], using inlays of exotic woods of different colors, as well as ivory and mother of pearl.

The style had three distinct periods. During the early years (1715-1730), called the Regency, when the King was too young to rule, furniture followed the massive, geometric Style Louis XIV style.  From 1730 until about 1750, the period known as the first style, it was much more asymmetrical, ornate and exuberant, in the fashion called ''[[rocaille]]''.  From about 1750 to the King's death in 1774, a reaction set in against the excesses of the rocaille.  The Second Style of Louis XV showed the influences of [[neo-classicism]], based on recent archeological discoveries in Italy and Greece. it featured Roman and Greek motifs.  The later furniture false eatured decorative elements of [[Chinoiserie]] and other exotic styles.&lt;ref&gt;Duchet, Robert, ''Caractéristique des Styles'' (1988), pp. 136-37&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis XV furniture was designed not for the vast palace state rooms of the Versailles of Louis XIV, but for the smaller, more intimate salons created by Louis XV and by his mistresses, [[Madame de Pompadour]] and [[Madame DuBarry]].  It included several new types of furniture, including the commode and the chiffonier, and many pieces,  particularly chairs and tables, were designed to be moved easily rearranged or moved from room to room, depending upon the kind of function.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'', pp. 63-73&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==History==
With the death of Louis XIV on 1 September 1715, his grandson, Louis XV, born in 1710, became King.  Because of his young age, France was ruled by a Regent, [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe of Orleans]], until 1723.  During this period, the style of furniture changed little from the Louis XIV period; it was massive, lavishly decorated and solemn, designed for the gigantic state halls of the new [[Palace of Versailles]].  In 1722 Louis XV moved from Paris, where he had lived with the Regent, to Versailles, began his own rule, and gradually imposed his own taste on the arts, architecture, and furniture.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, pp. 63-67&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis left the exterior of Versailles and the other palaces largely unchanged, but beginning in 1738 he extensively redesigned the interiors, creating the ''petits apartments'', or smaller apartments and salons for himself, the Queen, [[Marie Leczinska]], whom he married in 1725, and later, for his primary mistresses, [[Madame Pompadour]] and [[Madame du Barry]]. In these salons the traditional etiquette and formality of Louis XIV was abandoned.  These new suites of smaller rooms were furnished in a new style that  met the needs of comfort, intimacy and elegance.  Beginning in about 1730, His preference was for the style called ''[[rocaille]]'', a term which referred to an ornamental decoration resembling a stylized seashell, a style which expressed gaiety and fantasy. The ornament appeared rarely on the exteriors of the new buildings, but lavishly in the interiors, on the walls, ceilings, and furniture.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, pp. 63-67&lt;/ref&gt; The architects [[Robert de Cotte]] and [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]] remade the interiors of the [[Palace of Versailles]], the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]], and the [[Château de Compiègne]] in the new style.&lt;ref&gt;Wiegandt, ''Le Mobilier Français- Régence Louis XV'', pg. 9-13&lt;/ref&gt;

Palatial residences with rocaille interiors soon appeared In Paris.  They included the [[Hôtel Soubise]] in Paris, (now the National Archives) in 1705; the [[Hôtel Matignon]] (now the residence of the French Prime Minister) in 1721, by Jean Courtonne; and the Hôtel Biron (now the [[Musée Rodin]]) by Gabriel and [[Jean Aubert the Elder]].  They also appeared in the French provinces, the royal residence by  [[Emmanuel Héré]] in [[Nancy France|Nancy]], and  also in [[Aix-en-Provence]] and [[Bordeaux]]. All of these buildings featured rooms arranged in the new style;  the bedrooms took on new importance, and were surrounded by smaller anterooms and cabinets, including an entirely new kind of room, the dining-room. All of them needed new furniture to match the new style and arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;Wiegandt, pg. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a quarter of a century, the furniture designs of the ''rocaille'' style was dominant, particularly under the influence of  [[Juste-Aurèle Meissonier]] (1695-1750), the Italian-born architect who became royal architect and designer of Louis XV, and the ornament designer [[Nicolas Pineau]] (1684-1754). Under their influence, straight lines disappeared, replaced by curves, ornaments lost all symmetry, and garlands of flowers appeared everywhere. Designs inspired by Chinese art and other exotic sources appeared in profusion, though the ''rocaille'' style never reached the excess of exuberance of the [[rococo]] style that appeared in Italy, Austria and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Wiegandt, pg. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1740s, the style began to slowly change;  decoration became less extravagant and more discreet.  In 1754 the brother of Madame de Pompadour, the Marquis de Marigny, accompanied the designer [[Nicolas Cochin]] and a delegation of artists and scholars to Italy to see the recent discoveries at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], and made a grand tour of other classical monuments.  They returned full of enthusiasm for a new classical style, based on the Roman and Greek monuments.  In 1754 they published a manifesto against the Rocaille style, calling for a return to classicism. Marigny, after the death of Louis XV, later became director of buildings for Louis XVI.&lt;ref&gt;Wiegandt, pg. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Betwewen 1755 and 1760, the forms of furniture and interior decoration began to change into what became known as the Second Style Louis XV, or the ''Style Transition''.  The ''rocaille'' decoration remained, but became more discreet and restrained. Secondly, the new wave of enthusiasm for ancient Greece and Rome brought a series of new decorative themes, though the lines of the furniture were not much changed. This marked the beginning of what became French neoclassicism or [[Style Louis XVI]]. {{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=146}}

==Designers==
The earliest furniture designers under Louis XV during the Regency included [[Claude III Audran]], who had been responsible for furniture design under Louis XIV; [[Pierre Lepautre (1652–1716)|Pierre Lepautre]], who in 1699 became chief designer for Louis XIV, and  [[Gilles-Marie Oppenordt]], born in Holland, who became the furniture designer for the Regent.  Opponordt's designs in 1714 for the decor of the Hotel de Pomponne on Place des Victoires, featuring curving S and C forms, helped introduce the new style to Parisians.  Another important figure in introducing the new style was the painter [[Watteau]], a former pupil of Audran, who, besides his famous paintings, made arabesque designs for the woodwork of the new chateau of La Muette. ''{{Sfn|De Morant|1970|355}}

In the 1730s, notable designers included the sculptor and architect [[Nicolas Pineau]] and the jeweler [[Juste-Aurèle Meissonnier]];  their work featured a greater amount of asymmetry, floral design twisting elements and counter-curves.  In 1736 the carver and jewelry sculptor Jean Mondon published ''Premier Livre de form rocquaille et carte'', the first book specifically on the style, and was among the first to include elements of [[Chinoiserie]], notably dragons, a phoenix, and other figures. Engravings of their designs for furniture, woodwork and other decoration circulated widely throughout Europe, making the rocaille style a model for artists and craftsmen in other counties to follow. {{Sfn|De Morant|1970|355}}

==Craftsmen==
[[File:Commode MET DP105702.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Estampille'' or signature mark under top of table by [[Bernard II van Risamburgh]]]]
Louis XV furniture was created by the collaboration of complex network of designers and craftsmen.   The ''Menuisier'', made the wooden framework of the furniture, which was held together by its structure and wooden ''chevilles'' or dowels; the use of nails or glue was forbidden. The ''Ebenist'' then covered the frame and native woods with thin pieces of exotic woods, called [[marquetry]].  In the reign of Louis XIV  ebony was most often used for this covering, but,  beginning in 1675-80,  more exotic and colorful woods were used, which could give more picturesque effects.  This were sometimes placed in cubic designs, or checkerboards, or representing arabesques, floral patterns, trophies, or picturesque scenes.   Originally the plaques were about a centimeter thick, but by the end of the period plaques were only slightly more than two millimeters thick.{{sfn|Wiegandt|2005|page=22-25}}  Then the furniture was completed by the ''bronziers'', who made the handles and knobs;  the ''doreurs'' who gilded them; the ''fondeurs'', who made metalwork; the ''chiselers'' or wood sculptors, who made the decorate details, legs, and other carvings; the ''laqueurs''and ''vernisseurs'', who applied multiple coats of [[lacquer]] or [[varnish]]. {{sfn|De Morant|1970|page=379}}

After 1751 each work was signed by the master craftsman who oversaw the work.  This mark, called the ''Estampille'', used a heated iron to mark the piece with the initials of the master.  It was usually placed on the back of the rear traverse of chairs, under the marble of commodes and ''secretaries'', and under the surrounding ''ceinture'' of tables.  marks are often missing, either forgotten by the craftsman, or defaced.  Given the high value of signed pieces by famous craftsmen, Counterfeit ''Estampilles'' are not unknown.{{sfn|Wiegandt|2005|page=22-25}}

==Chairs and sofas==
Between 1769 and 1775, the furniture designer [[André Jacob Roubo]] published a series of books of engravings called ''L'Art du menusier'', detailing the categories and styles.  He divided the chairs into two categories;  those with a straight back, called ''á la Reine'', and those with a rounded back, called ''en cabriolet''. {{Sfn|Wiegandt|2005|page=54}}   The chairs ''en cabriolet'' were usually lighter, often had cane seats and backs, and could be moved around easily.   included some new styles, notably the ''voyeuse'' a small chair with an armrest on the back, so the person seated could either face forward or turn around and sit astride the chair with his arms on the back of the chair.   {{Sfn|De Morant|1970|page=380}}

The ''fauteuils'', or armchairs, were larger and designed for comfort; their styles evolved during the reign of Louis XV.  During the early years of the Regency (1715-23) the armchairs had short curved feet, the top of the back was slightly curved, while the supports of the back and the arms were straight.  The armchairs of the middle Louis XV period (1723-1750) were smaller than those of the Louis XIV period, but more comfortable. The legs were more curved, the top of the back was rounded, and often had a small ornamental design.  The back of the chair took on a more graceful violin form. This form became known as the ''Chaise a la Reine'', or "Chair of the Queen." {{Sfn|De Morant|1970|page=380}}

A variety of other new forms appeared, designed especially for comfort.  The ''Bergere'' had a low seat with an additional cushion, and  sometimes added padded wings atop the arms on either side of the back which protected the head against drafts, which also made it easier to take naps. Other new types that were introduced were the ''marquise'', basically an armchair expanded to seat two persons, and the ''chaise longue'', an armchair with a lengthened seat to support the legs, and the ''Duchesse'', where two chairs could be combined with an extension between. {{Sfn|De Morant|1970|page=381}}   Another new type was the ''Fauteuil de cabinet'', a type of chair designed to go with a desk, and to provide more comfort while writing.    It was usually upholstered in leather fastened with gilded nails to the frame, had rounded angles, and one leg of the chair was placed in the front, another directly behind, for greater stability.  The curved back and arms of the chair enveloped the person seated. {{Sfn|Wiegandt|2005|page=64}}

The passion for the oriental and exotic soon influenced the furniture.  A new kind of seat, ''La Sultane'' was introduced, with two places; another type called the ''Ottomane'', with the back in a form called ''en gondola'', and arms which wrapped around the oval seat, and another variety, called ''la papose'',without arms or a back;  and finally ''Le Sofa'', which featured cushions which could be moved and rearranged.{{Sfn|De Morant|1970|page=381}}

The last phase of the Louis XV style, the gradual transition toward the neoclassical, had a limited effect on chairs.  The basic forms remained, but the decoration increasingly took the form of garlands of flowers called ''a l'ántique'' in a repetitive rhythm, which opposed the sinuous form of the carved legs and frame.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=146}}

==Consoles and tables==
The ''Table en console'' or [[Console table]], was designed to be placed against a wall, often in front of mirror, and held statuettes or porcelain objects.   It was among the most lavishly decorated pieces of furniture of the early Louis XV period.  It was usually made of oak, carved and gilded,  and drenched with   ''rocaille'' decoration, usually in the form of seashells and foliage. The and legs in the form of an exaggerated S or a reverse S.  The supporting frame under the table was also highly decorated, sometimes holding porcelain objects, and sculpted figures of dragons or other mythical animals.  The face of the table often had rocaille masks. a g rocaille modeled after seashells and foliage.  They usually had a plaque of colored marble on top. {{Sfn|Wiegandt|2005|pages=42-43}}

Another popular style of table was the ''bureau plat'', or flat desk.  It was introduced by [[André-Charles Boulle]] around 1710 in the late reign of Louis XIV, as a replacement for the desk mounted atop two columns of drawes.  The early versions by Boulle were made of ebony and dark wood, and had eight legs, and six drawers, which were decorated with gilded bronze handles. The slightly curved legs ending in gilded ornaments in the shape of deer's feet. Gilded bronze ''espagnolettes''  decorated the corners and legs.  Later in the period, the flat desks featured an abundance of marquetry; they were made of oak or spain, were embedded with thin plaques of exotic woods of contrasting colors.   Another celebrated creator of tables was [[Charles Cressent]], who carried on the refined and harmonious ornamental style of Boulle. {{Sfn|Wiegandt|2005|pages=42-50}}

A number of small, specialized and portable tables appeared around of after 1755, some of them designed for Madame de Pomapdour.  These included the ''table de chevet'', a very small utility table  made of oak and inlaid with rosewood and other precious woods, which could be put in the closet when not needed; the ''Table d'en-cas'', or "Just in case" table, a small piece with two drawers, small cupboard with a grilled door,  and a marble top;  the ''Chiffonière'', a small table with gracefully curving legs and a porcelain top. Another small table was the ''cabaret'' or ''á café'' table,  with a small marble top and long legs, on which  coffee or drinks could be served. The version introduced in 1770 featured geometric designs and a neoclassical frieze around the plateau. {{Sfn|Wiegandt|2005|pages=90-91}}

Another popular type of small table was the ''Table de toilette'', or dressing table.  One particular variety, ''en coeur'', or heart-shaped, was especially designed for men; it stood on three legs mounted on rollers, contained an assortment of drawers and small compartments, and featured a folding mirror on top. {{Sfn|Wiegandt|2005|pages=92}}

In the late, second style of Louis XV, after 1750,  the tables lost the rococo curves and took on classical (or imagined classical) details, including table legs in the form of Doric columns; griffon paws and lion paws on the feet;,  trophies of arms, friezes, and figures of nymphs, tripods and horns of plenty, This style was termed, rather imaginatively,  ''a la Greque'', and presaged the neoclassical period to come.  {{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=138}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Commodes and chests==
The [[Commode]] (whose name means "convenient") was invented under Louis XIV to replace the ''coffre'', or large chest. It was  heavy and boxlike, with short legs, and abundant decoration of gilded bronze. During the Regency and early style of Louis XV, particularly in the commodes of [[Charles Cressent]], commodes became more graceful, with longer S-shaped legs and ''espagnolettes'', or stylized female torsos, on the corners above the legs.  The fronts of commodes became more rounded in form.  Gilded bronze vines curled and wound across the facade. Bronze ornaments in the form of masks were replaced by faces of smiling women,  palmettes, and, later in the period, a new theme, s stylized bat wing. The seashell was a common central element of the rocaille decoration, often combined with acanthus leaves.  Handles of drawers were shaped like intertwined flowers.  Sculpted images of various animals also appeared near the end of the early period. {{Sfn|Renault and Lazé|(2006)|pages=63-65}}

A large number of skilled ''[[ébéniste]]s'' from around Europe were employed to make fine wood Commodes and other furniture for the new apartments built by Louis XV at Versailles, Fontainebleau, and his other residences.   They included [[Jean-François Oeben]], [[Roger Vandercruse Lacroix]], [[Gilles Joubert]], [[Antoine Gaudreau]], and [[Martin Carlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pg. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

As the period advanced, the marquetry, or inlays of different-colored woods, became finer and more dominant. Various geometric patterns, including the checkerboard, stars, and losanges, appeared, along with bouquets of flowers made of fine marquetry. {{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=144}}  New techniques of lacquering wood were introduced, based on Chinese and Japanese techniques, which were frequently used on the front panels of commodes.   A particular variation, called the ''façon de Chine'' or "Chinese fashion" was introduced, which contrasted the gilded bronze ornament and handles against the black lacquered wood.  The designs often borrowed motifs from Chinese and Japanese art. {{Sfn|Renault and Lazé|(2006)|pages=63-65}}

Beginning in 1755-60, the reaction against the excesses of the ''rocaille'' form began.  The shapes of commodes became more boxlike, the front flat, and the legs shorter, though they retained their slight S curve. The faces of the commodes were decorated with geometric friezes of oak leaves, roses  or serpents and drapery motifs, the early manifestation of the Greco-Roman Neoclassical style.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=146}}

A new form of commode, the ''Cartonnier'', appeared in the 1760s, inspired by somewhat fantastic ideas of ancient Greek furniture. Its front was lavishly decorated with friezes, trophies of arms and lions heads, while on the top, a pedestal supported by two scrolled ''volutes'' held a group of replicas of classical Greek statues. {{Sfn|Ducher|1988|pages=146-147}}

==Desks==
During the reign of Louis XV, the ''bureau'' and  ''secretaire'' gradually evolved into the form of the modern desk, along with a wide variety of more elaborate variations.   At the beginning the 18th century, [[André Charles Boulle]] and [[Charles Cressent]] had created the ''bureau au plat''. a writing table with columns of drawers, graceful curving legs, gilded bronze decoration, and fine marquetry in geometric forms.  Jacques Dubois made a series of celebrated desks in this fashion the 1740s.

Around 1750, a new variety appeared, called the ''Secretaire à capuchin'' or ''à la Bourgone'', which contained a section of drawers which could be raised up, while the top folded out into a writing surface. In addition to the drawers, it contained a number of secret compartments concealed within. Numerous other variants appeared soon afterwards;  the ''Secrétaire en pent'', or sloping desk first appeared in about 1735. It was a small cabinet with a sloping front which opened out into a writing surface.  It was also called ''en dos d'âne'', or "style of donkey's back".   Madame de Pompadour possessed one of these, made between 1748–52, with a varnish of red and a blue in the Chinese style, which combined ''rocaille'' and exoticism.  [[Mathieu Criaerd]] made a secretary in this style in about 1750, with marquetry of violette, amarante, satin wood and gided bronze. {{Sfn|Wiegandt|2005|pages=85-88}}

A much simpler variety, the ''pupitre à écrire debut'', of pulpit for writing while standing, arrived at about the same time.  The finest models were usually made of oak and fir, covered with marquetry of rose wood, satin wood, and amaranth.  They had small wheels to be moved around easily, had a locked compartment under the sloping top surface, and shelves below for large documents. {{Sfn|Wiegandt|2005|pages=85-88}}

The ''Secretaire en armoire'' was a larger and more vertical variation, based on the form of an armoire; it was a large chest with a writing surface that folded down and drawers and shelves inside. It was designed to stand against a wall, and appeared in about 1750.  It often featured a marquetry in a geometric pattern resembling cubes of dark and light wood, a design vey popular in the last years of the Louis XV period.

The ''Bonheur-du-jour'' was a small desk with cabinet which appeared in about 1760.  Following the new style of the late Louis XV period, it had no gilded bronze.  It featured graceful curbed legs, but the top part was geometric, with delicate inlays of marquetry flowers.

The most celebrated new type of desk invented under Louis XV was the ''Bureau à cylindre'' or rolltop desk, which appeared in about 1760. The master of this form was [[Jean-François Oeben]].   It had no gilded bronze other than a delicate frieze around the top,;  very fine marquetry of flowers, and an interior with secret compartments. Many variants were made, including the [[Bureau du Roi|desk of Louis XV]] now on display at Versailles.{{Sfn|Wiegandt|2005|pages=85-88}}

==Beds==
Under Louis XV the bedroom  was a place of ceremony; the formal awakening of the King in his bed chamber (even if he had actually slept elsewhere) was a formal  event, attended by members of the Court and visitors to the Palace.  The form of the bed and its covering evolved under Louis XV. Early beds had four posts and a canopy suspended from a rectangual form on top.  Under Louis XV, the ''Lit a la polonaise'' appeared, with a  canopy suspended from a  crownlike structure;  and the ''Lit à la Duchesse'', where the canopy was supported only from one end.  The bed was usually separated from the rest of the room by a balustrade,  and stools were arranged outside the balustrade for the Court to witness the formal awakening.

The famous  [[Encyclopédie]] of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (1751–72) included images of beds ''a la Polonaise'', and ''a la Turque'' (a more ornate and exotic version of the Duchesse) and a bed placed into an alcove.  (Volume 8, pg. 216).

==Transition From Rocaille to neo-classicism==
Later in the reign of Louis XV, between 1755 and 1760, tastes in furniture began to change. The ''rocaille'' designs began more discreet and restrained, and the influence of antiquity and neo-classicism began to appear in new designs of furniture.  The Commodes became to have more geometric forms;  the decoration turned from rocaille to geometric forms, garlands of oak leaves, flowers and classical motifs.  The legs gradually changed from s-curves to straight, often modeled after Greek or roman columns, tapering to a point.  Common decorations included stylized pine cones, and knotted ribbons. A new type of tall cabinet, the ''Cartonnier'', made its appearance between 1760 and 1765.  It took its inspiration from Greek mythology and architecture, with friezes, vaulting, sculpted trophies, bronze lion heads,  and other classic, elements.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pg. 146-47&lt;/ref&gt;

The ebenists [[Jean-Henri Riesener]],  [[Jean-François Leleu]], [[Martin Carlin]] and [[David Roentgen]]  and menuisier  [[Georges Jacob]] were among the most important creators of the late Louis XV transition style. Their careers continued and reached their peak during the following reign of Louis XVI.

The '''Maschen disc brooch''' is an [[Early Medieval]] [[fibula (brooch)|fibula]], which was found in 1958 during [[archaeological excavation]]s of the late [[Saxons|Saxon]] [[grave field]] near [[Maschen]], in the [[Lower Saxony]] district of [[Harburg (district)|Harburg]], [[Germany]]. On its face side, the fibula shows an unidentified [[saint]] with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]. It was found in a woman's grave of the beginning of the [[Christianization]] of [[northern Germany]], and is in the permanent exhibition of the [[Archäologisches Museum Hamburg|Archaeological Museum Hamburg]] in [[Harburg, Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Topic Death, Showcase no. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Articus"&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Articus | first1 =Rüdiger  | last2 =Brandt | first2 =Jochen | last3 =Först | first3 =Elke | last4 =Krause | first4 =Yvonne | last5 =Merkel | first5 =Michael | last6 =Mertens | first6 =Kathrin | last7 =Weiss | first7 =Rainer-Maria | title =Archaeological Museum Hamburg Helms-Museum: A short guide to the Tour of the Times | series = Archaeological Museum Hamburg publication | publisher = Helms-Museum  | volume =103 | edition = | year =2013 | location = Hamburg | pages =159 | isbn =978-3-931429-24-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==

The [[cemetery]] was located on the western fringes of the ''{{lang|de|Hallonen}}'', an approximately {{convert|63|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} mountain range which is running out on the {{convert|23|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} ''{{lang|de|Fuchsberg}}'' some {{convert|1200|m|ft}} southeast of the village center of Maschen. During [[sand]] extraction from the Fuchsberg for the construction of the nearby [[Bundesautobahn 1]], two [[Bronze Age]] [[Tumulus|tumuli]] were discovered in 1958. 

The following excavations revealed that both grave [[mound]]s were disturbed to the undisturbed ground. Except for a few [[ceramic]] vessel shards and a [[razor]] from several later [[burial]]s on the hill, no further [[Feature (archaeology)|findings]] were recorded. While pushing off the [[humus]]layer {{convert|20|m|ft}} north of the tumuli, the first late Saxon flat graves appeared in the ground. Additionally some soil discolorations appeared at a brim of the sand mine some {{convert|80|m|ft}} east, indicating burial pits. During the initially launched rescue excavation, the complete burial site were excavated and documented in a three-week operation. It was the first fully documented late Saxon burial site of northern Germany so far with a total of 210 examined burials. 

21 burials were oriented in south-north direction and the majority of 189 burials were created in west-east orientation. The Maschen disc brooch was found in the grave No. 54 of a wealthy woman.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz_1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wegewitz | first = Willi | title = Das Reihengräberfeld von Maschen | journal = Hammaburg N.F | volume = 8 | year = 1988 | issn = 0173-0886 | isbn = 3-529-01356-0 | pages = 161-171 (164-165) | language = German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Findings ==

The Maschen disc brooch lay with its face side down on the woman's chest. The brooch has a diameter of {{convert|30|mm|in}} and is made of different colored [[vitreous enamel]] in [[cloisonné]] technique on a [[copper]] plate. The copper base of the brooch is can shaped, and the enamel plate was fixed in the copper base on a bed of [[loam]] by [[flange|flanging]] the protruding edges of the bases wall. The needle apparatus was not preserved. The remaining hinges indicate that it was a needle with a coil spring. Both the metal parts and enamel inlays are slightly worn. A [[radiology|radiological]] examination revealed that the enamel layer has a thickness of {{convert|0.4|mm|in}}.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz_1988"/&gt; The front face of the disc brooch depicts a stylized chest portrait on a now red background. The face and neck of the portrayed person are made of now greenish white enamel. Its eyes and nose region is formed by a curved bar made of copper, ending in two loops as stylized eyes. Around the head a kind of halo is shown, made of whitish to light blue enamel. The upper body has a semi-elliptical shape. The body is decorated by two widely arced copper bars from the neck towards the shoulders, which end there in small loops. The area around the neck of the figure is made of now light blue to turquoise enamel. The lower chest area, below the copper bars, is made of a now dark blue enamel.

== Interpretation ==
[[File:Scheibenfibel Todtglüsingen.jpg|thumb|The almost identical Todtglüsingen disc brooch]]
Due to its halo-like ornament around the head, the figure on the Maschen disc brooch is interpreted as an unspecified saint, and may possibly depict [[Jesus Christ]]. The addition of the fibula as a [[grave good]] indicates that the buried woman was an early Christian. She may have promised herself a salvation effect from the depicted figure, as the brooch was found placed with its face side on her chest.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz_1988"/&gt; 

Due to the geographical orientation of the burial and its location within the cemetery, the burial has been [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dated]] to the period between 800 and 900 AD, which marks the beginning of the thorough Christianization of Northern Germany.&lt;ref name="Articus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wegewitz_1988"/&gt; 

So far, some 100 comparison finds of fibulae of the Maschen disc brooch type were known, but they all came from stray finds or were collected from the surface without any assignment to a specific grave, and therefore a more precise dating of this type of brooches has been impossible before.&lt;ref name="Wegewitz_1988"/&gt; 

By the end of 2012 another nearly identical piece was found in a construction area at the [[Tostedt]] district of Todtglüsingen. The origin of this fibula is believed to be the [[Lower Rhine region]] and the noticeable accumulation of finds at the [[Niederelbe]] area may indicate that it has faced an increased popularity especially in this region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brandt | first = Jochen | title = Frisch vom Acker | editors = Mitteilungen des Museums- und Heimatvereins Harburg-Stadt und -Land e.&amp;nbsp;V., Helms-Museum | journal = Helms-Museum Aktuell | number = 29 |date=March 2013 | pages = 4 | language = German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''My Immortal''''' is a ''[[Harry Potter]]'' [[fan fiction]] serially published on [[FanFiction.Net]] between 2006 and 2007. Known for its incomprehensible narrative and constant digressions, the story centers on a 17-year-old female vampire, a non-canonical character, and her relationships with the characters of the ''Harry Potter'' series, most notably her romantic relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]]. Ultimately, she is prompted by visions to travel back in time to try to defeat the main [[antagonist]] of the series, [[Lord Voldemort]].

Since the beginning of the work's publication, it has garnered infamy for bad writing, inconsistency, and disregard for the ''Harry Potter'' source material. Often regarded as among the worst fan fiction written, ''My Immortal'' is felt to be a detriment to those attempting to bring legitimacy to fan fiction. Despite this, the series has also inspired multiple derivative works, including a [[YouTube]] web series, and is viewed with nostalgia for adolescent fan life.

The author's identity has never been confirmed and has been deemed by many as "unsolvable". The author published the story under the username "XXXbloodyrists666XXX" and self-identified as Tara Gilesbie. In September 2017, someone claiming to be the author updated a [[FictionPress]] account stating that she had created an active [[Tumblr]] account under her real name; an effort to locate this Tumblr account resulted in the account of [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] novelist Rose Christo. She has since stated that she was one of two co-authors of ''My Immortal'', and had provided evidence of her authorship to [[Macmillan Publishers]], but controversy that same month over factual errors in her then-forthcoming memoirs has led to doubt as to her authorship.

The story has been speculated to be a hoax designed to either [[Internet troll|troll]] readers or to [[Satire|satirize]] fan fiction, but the work and the alleged online presence of the author has also been described as too elaborate and too time-consuming to fake effectively. In September 2017, Christo stated that ''My Immortal'' is a work of satire, though any evidence of this is tied to her own claims of authorship.

==Background and publication==
The work was published to [[FanFiction.Net]] between early 2006 and 2007, ultimately totaling 44 chapters and nearly 22,700 words.&lt;ref name="Vulture"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|title=The Bizarre, Unsolved Mystery of ‘My Immortal,’ the World’s Worst Fanfiction Story|last=Riesman|first=Abraham|date=March 12, 2015|website=|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125172838/http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|archivedate=November 25, 2015|deadurl=no|accessdate=November 28, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forty-fourth chapter was accompanied by an author's note explaining that the author was leaving "{{sic|dubya}}", commonly believed to be [[Dubai]], and the chapter would be the last until the author's return.&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TheVerge"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|title=The Worst Thing Ever Written|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=December 10, 2013|website=|publisher=[[The Verge]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202084919/http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|archivedate=December 2, 2015|deadurl=no|accessdate=November 28, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no further chapters were published. It was removed by site administrators in 2008, a few months after its last chapter was published. However, it survives in [[Cut, copy, and paste|copied-and-pasted]] versions across the Internet.&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt; The work apparently takes its name from the song "[[My Immortal]]" by [[Evanescence]].&lt;ref name="TheVerge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyDot"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/fandom/worst-harry-potter-fanfic-my-immortal-web-series/|title=The worst "Harry Potter" fanfic ever is now a hilarious webseries|last=Baker-Whitelaw|first=Gavia|date=July 29, 2013|website=|publisher=''[[The Daily Dot]]''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612122150/http://www.dailydot.com/fandom/worst-harry-potter-fanfic-my-immortal-web-series/|archivedate=June 12, 2016|deadurl=no|access-date=June 12, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and genre==
''My Immortal'' is split into 44 brief chapters. Author's notes, indicated by "AN", precede and are dispersed throughout the narrative prose. These notes are written in a largely [[phonetic spelling]] and characterized the author as "standoffish". As the work progressed, these author's notes increasingly became "defensive, impenetrable, and prone to mentioning [[suicide attempt]]s" and defended the work's poor spelling and deviation from canon characterization from negative reviewers.&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt;

[[Abraham Riesman]] of [[Vulture.com]] described the prose as having "awkward rhythm, strange digressions, and stultifyingly [[purple prose]]" and noted that the work is "agonizing" to a regular fan fiction reader because of "all the hated [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]" it employs in the opening passage alone.&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt; [[Adi Robertson]] of ''[[The Verge]]'' observed that the quality of the prose declined after the twelfth chapter, when the work's editor had a falling out with the author and became temporarily uninvolved with the work; even after the editor and author reconciled, Robertson felt that the prose "never recovered".&lt;ref name="TheVerge" /&gt; [[Gavia Baker-Whitelaw]] of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' noted the work "featured all the hallmarks of terrible fanfic: hundreds of grammar and spelling mistakes, a nonsensical storyline, and a [[Mary Sue]] protagonist who was clearly a glorified version of the author" and pointed out the numerous descriptions of the protagonist's [[Hot Topic]] outfits.&lt;ref name="DailyDot" /&gt;

The work is characterized by misspellings permeating both the work itself and the author's notes, to the point that the names of the protagonist and canonical ''Harry Potter'' characters are frequently and variously misspelled.&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyDot" /&gt;

The work has also been noted to fail to adhere to ''Harry Potter'' canon. It features "an incredibly OOC&amp;nbsp;[out-of-character] ''Harry Potter''&amp;nbsp;universe"&lt;ref name="TheMarySue"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/my-immortal-webseries/|title=Infamously Bad ''Harry Potter'' Fanfic ''My Immortal'' Gets Web Series|last=Jaffe|first=Brooke|date=July 29, 2013|website=|publisher=[[The Mary Sue]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713124934/http://www.themarysue.com/my-immortal-webseries/|archivedate=July 13, 2016|deadurl=no|access-date=June 12, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where "at no point do any of the ''Harry Potter'' characters act even slightly like themselves".&lt;ref name="io9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-most-infamously-awful-fanfic-ever-my-immortal-h-961749327|title=The most infamously awful fanfic ever, "My Immortal," has a web series|last=Bricken|first=Rob|date=July 30, 2013|website=|publisher=[[io9]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616021429/http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-most-infamously-awful-fanfic-ever-my-immortal-h-961749327|archivedate=June 16, 2016|deadurl=no|access-date=June 12, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; References to "decidedly un-Harry Potterish bands" such as [[My Chemical Romance]] have also been noted.&lt;ref name="DailyDot" /&gt;

Chapters 39 and 40, according to the author's notes, were written by a hacker, and the writing in both chapters was a "much more controlled prose that read like a lampoon of the previous 38".&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt;

==Authorship==
===2006–2016: Speculation on authorship and genre===
''My Immortal'' was published under the username "XXXbloodyrists666XXX", and the author also used the name "Tara Gilesbie". Author's notes in the story identified a friend nicknamed Raven, operating under the username "bloodytearz666", as the work's editor and [[beta reader]]. Later author's notes claimed that someone hacked into Gilesbie's account and wrote chapters 39 and 40.&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt;

The true identity of the author became subject to wide speculation, and since the publication of the final chapter, various individuals have claimed to have written the work in jest or as a hoax.&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt; Due to its "systematically terrible" quality, the work is often believed to be a [[satire]] or [[parody]] of fan fiction.&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyDot" /&gt; 

At the same time, the "exceedingly complicated" details of the work, including a series of related online accounts outside of FanFiction.net and the effort of writing a work of such length, led to a "consensus" among users of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]—a website notorious for online trolling and dedicated to cataloging "internet culture" — that it would be too difficult to fake and that Gilesbie was writing sincerely, a sentiment apparently shared by other online communities who mocked the author.&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt; [[Brad Kim]], editor of [[Know Your Meme]], supported the work as genuine, citing his experiences with writing workshops on [[LiveJournal]] and [[Xanga]] where he encountered similar works, as "these were the kinds of things that would be formulated by a high-school teenager in the early 2000s".&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt; Writing for [[Vulture.com]], Abraham Riesman wrote that "[t]he mystery of the authorship of 'My Immortal' — even in this privacy-averse age — appears unsolvable."&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt;

===2017: Rose Christo co-authorship claim===
Rose Christo, author of [[Young adult fiction|young adult novels]], began writing a memoir about her alleged experiences as a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] child in the New York [[Foster care in the United States|foster care system]] titled ''Under the Same Stars: the Search for my Brother and the True Story of My Immortal''. The memoir details the period of time during which she allegedly co-wrote ''My Immortal''. [[Macmillan Publishers]] allegedly hired a lawyer to verify Christo's claims over the course of three days; she claimed to have provided proof through the email address with which she created the FanFiction.net account and a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] containing the first eleven unedited chapters of ''My Immortal''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In March 2017, Christo quietly stated on her [[Tumblr]] account that she co-wrote ''My Immortal''; however, the post gained little notice. In early August 2017, Christo posted an update to a previously unknown FictionPress account seemingly related to Tara Gilesbie that similarly received little attention.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/13/16275802/who-wrote-my-immortal-tara-rose-christo|title=My Immortal: solving the mystery of the internet’s most beloved — and notorious — fanfic|last=Romano|first=Aja|date=September 13, 2017|website=|publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in August, an [[Self-publishing|independently published]] ''Handbook for Mortals'' came to public attention after it was discovered that its sales were artificially inflated to push it to the top of the young adult [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]], from which it was subsequently removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/books/la-et-jc-handbook-for-mortals-bestseller-ya-20170824-story.html |title=Did a YA book buy its way to the top of the New York Times bestseller list? |work=LA Times |author=Jessica Roy |date=August 24, 2017 |accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Italie&gt;{{cite news|last1=Italie|first1=Hillel|title=Book Pulled From Best-Seller List|url=http://time.com/4917209/ny-times-best-seller-handbook-for-mortals/|accessdate=September 11, 2017|work=Time|agency=Associated Press|date=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing similarities between the novel and ''My Immortal'' led to speculation that ''Handbook for Mortals'' author [[Lani Sarem]] was the author of ''My Immortal''. Christo again updated the FictionPress account to say she was not Sarem. She also posted on FictionPress to state that her only social media account was on Tumblr, which operated under her real name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/my-immortal-fanfic-2017-update/|title=Did the mysterious fanfic author behind ‘My Immortal’ just resurface?|last=Baker-Whitelaw|first=Gavia|date=August 31, 2017|website=|publisher=''[[The Daily Dot]]''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831214232/https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/my-immortal-fanfic-2017-update/|archive-date=2017-08-31|dead-url=no|access-date=August 31, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial assistant at Macmillan Publishers also stated that Sarem was not the author of ''My Immortal'' and stated that MacMillan was to publish the author's memoir.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

These statements sparked a search for the claimed Tumblr account, which was found as Christo's in early September. By September 5, Christo stated on her Tumblr account that she co-wrote ''My Immortal'' and that she had provided proof to her publisher [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], later reported by [[BuzzFeed]],&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/alannabennett/my-immortal-author-hi-vampire|title=People Think They Have The Answer To The Decade-Long Mystery Of Who Wrote "My Immortal"|last=Bennett|first=Alanna|date=September 5, 2017|website=|publisher=[[Buzzfeed]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on September 7, BuzzFeed published her first official statement as the alleged author of ''My Immortal.''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/alannabennett/exclusive-first-look-under-same-stars-my-immortal-memoir|title=The Story Of "My Immortal" Is More Wild And Heartbreaking Than You Imagined|last=Bennett|first=Alanna|date=September 7, 2017|website=|publisher=[[Buzzfeed]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said of her decision to publicly identify herself as a co-author: "I would never have come forward about ''My&amp;nbsp;Immortal'' if not for the fact that it coincided with the things that happened to me as a teen."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Later that month, a forum post on Kiwi Farms, a forum notorious for perpetrating [[doxing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/07/kiwi-farms-the-webs-biggest-community-of-stalkers.html|title=Kiwi Farms, the Web’s Biggest Community of Stalkers|last=Pless|first=Margaret|date= July 19, 2016|website=|publisher=''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''|access-date=November 4, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Christo's brother (the subject of her memoir), verified as such by the forum operators, refuted several of Christo's claims in the upcoming memoir, including those of their ancestry and shared childhood history.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hypable.com/my-immortal-and-5-unanswered-burning-questions/|title=The ‘My Immortal’ mystery grows: Five new questions after the memoir’s cancellation|last=Bryne-Cristiano|first=Laura|date=October 5, 2017|website=|publisher=Hypable|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memoir was subsequently canceled by MacMillan after an investigation found factual errors in her narrative; Christo stated that these errors had been purposefully made in an attempt to protect her family's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jarrylee/the-my-immortal-book-is-no-longer-going-to-be-published|title=The "My Immortal" Book Is No Longer Going To Be Published|last=Lee|first=Jarry|date=October 3, 2017|website=|publisher=[[Buzzfeed]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christo's brother has additionally said that he does not know if Christo wrote ''My Immortal'' and that she enjoyed ridiculing badly written fan fiction.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://moviepilot.com/p/brother-of-my-immortal-author-casts-serious-doubt-on-her-claims/4383046|title=The Author Of 'My Immortal' Is A Fake And I Don't Know What To Believe Anymore|last=Tremeer|first=Eleanor|date=October 5, 2017|website=Movie Pilot|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Christo confirmed via Tumblr in October that her original name was Theresa Rose Christodoulopoulos, confirmed her brother's identity, conceded to many of his revelations about her, but also disagreed with a few of his claims and reiterated her claim that she was one of the authors of ''My Immortal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rosechristo1.tumblr.com/post/166154457119/hey-guys-im-still-around-so-it-looks-like-a-few|title=kamakisikaw - Rose Christo's Tumblr account|last=Christo|first=Rose|date=October 7, 2017|website=[[Tumblr]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6u2t5THqM?url=https://rosechristo1.tumblr.com/post/166154457119/hey-guys-im-still-around-so-it-looks-like-a-few#|archive-date=2017-10-07|dead-url=yes|access-date=October 7, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She closed the Tumblr account a few days later. ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' described Christo's authorship claim as one of the more likely claims she has made, though still in some doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/9/16428248/my-immortal-still-a-mystery-rose-christo-fake |title=The My Immortal memoir has been canceled, and the mystery of the notorious fanfic deepens |date=2017-10-09 |accessdate=2017-10-09 |publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The [[protagonist]] of the story is Ebony (occasionally Enoby, Eboby, Evony, Ebory, Enobby, Enopby, Egogy, Tara, or TaEbory) Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way, a seventeen-year-old [[vampire]] who attends [[Hogwarts]] (located in [[England]] instead of the original books' [[Scotland]]) as a member of [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]]. Hogwarts is depicted as being divided between two [[clique]]s, the "[[Goth subculture|goffs]]" and the [[Preppy|preps]]. Ebony and all the [[sympathetic character]]s are part of the goth clique while the members of the prep clique are portrayed unsympathetically. Many of the main characters of ''Harry Potter'' are given {{Sic|"goffik"}}  makeovers, moved to the Slytherin House, and renamed.

The story begins by focusing on Ebony entering a relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]], who is depicted as shy, sensitive and [[bisexuality|bisexual]]. Ebony and Draco have sex in the [[Hogwarts|Forbidden Forest]], but are witnessed by Hogwarts' principal [[Albus Dumbledore]] (often referred to as "Albert Dumblydore"), who yells at them and derides them as {{Sic|"motherfukers"}}. Later, after learning that Draco used to date [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry "Vampire" Potter]] (a nickname he gained because he "love[s] the taste of human blood"), Ebony becomes so angry that she runs crying into the Forbidden Forest, where she meets [[Lord Voldemort]]. Voldemort, speaking in faux-archaic English (unlike his teenaged self from the 80s), gives her a [[gun]] and demands that she kill "Vampire" Potter or else he will kill Draco, but Ebony refuses. Later on, Draco learns of this encounter and he is so angry that Ebony kept it from him that he commits [[suicide]] by [[self-harm|slitting his wrists]].

In a subsequent scene, however, Vampire has a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of Draco being held prisoner by Voldemort. The discrepancy between this and the earlier depiction of Draco having committed suicide is not explained. After rescuing Draco from Voldemort, Ebony and her friends attend a [[My Chemical Romance]] concert in [[Places in Harry Potter#Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. After some songs have been played, the concert ends abruptly when the members of My Chemical Romance reveal themselves to be Voldemort and his [[Death Eater]]s. Voldemort, who had been disguised as lead vocalist [[Gerard Way]], proclaims his intent to kill Ebony and Draco for the former's failure to kill Vampire, but they are saved by Albus Dumbledore, who has just given himself a gothic makeover. The next day, Dumbledore gives a gothic makeover to the Hogwarts Great Hall as well, but Ebony feels that he is a [[poseur]] and dislikes him greatly, a sentiment shared by her friends.

During this time, [[Death Eater#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] are inexplicably shot by a gun-toting "black guy" (likely meant to be [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] given the vampire themes). There is also a secondary plot point in which [[Professor Trelawney]] ("Trevolry") / [[Professor Sinistra]] ("Sinister", "Sinatra"), combined into one character, has an addiction to what is presumably the truth serum [[Veritaserum]]. A third plot point sees [[Hogwarts staff#Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] (often referred to as "Mc[[Google]]" or "McGoggles") and [[Severus Snape]] (often called "Snap", or "Snope" at times) attempting to rape or harm the protagonists. Yet another plot point follows [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] and Snape being bisexuals who spy on Ebony, at one point resulting in a moment shortly after Draco's "death" where they are sitting on their broomsticks with "Loopin {{Sic|[[Masturbation|masticating]]}}" to Ebony bathing. In addition, [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is inexplicably a teenaged Hogwarts student who has a crush on Ebony, and who is also a Satanist.

Ebony begins having mysterious visions, which she is told indicates she must [[time travel|travel back in time]] (using a [[pensieve]]) to stop Tom Riddle from becoming Voldemort by seducing him, and to retrieve a cure for Sinister/Trevolry's addiction to "Volxemortserum". Arriving in the past, she meets the young Riddle, who calls himself "[[Satan]]", and who has been mistakenly referred to as "[[Neo (The Matrix)|Tom Anderson]]", "[[Tom Bombadil]]", and "Stan". "Satan" is in a band with [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], Severus Snape, Sirius Black, and [[Lucius Malfoy]]. He is uncanonically depicted attending Hogwarts at the same time as the Marauders in what is further uncanonically portrayed as the 1980s. The author points out a few [[anachronism]]s in these scenes, telling readers to ignore them. There is also an unexplained cameo by a gothic [[Marty McFly]], who gives Ebony a black [[DeLorean time machine]] able to transform into an [[iPod]], allowing her to travel forward in time.

Eventually, Ebony brings "Satan" forward in time, where he morphs into the present-day Voldemort. This leads to a confrontation between the forces of good and evil in the Great Hall. The story ends ambiguously with Ebony firing off an [[Avada Kedavra]] curse, which is misrepresented as "[[abracadabra|abra kedabra]]".

==Reception==
{{Expand section|date=July 2016}}
Before its removal from FanFiction.Net, ''My Immortal'' allegedly gained between 8,000&lt;ref name="TheVerge" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ultimate Guide to the Harry Potter Fandom|last=Payne|first=E.A.|publisher=Rowan Tree Books|year=2011|isbn=978-0615714912|location=|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 10,000&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt; reviews per posted chapter, most of which were negative and contained [[Flaming (Internet)|flaming]].&lt;ref name="TheVerge"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The quality of the writing and the author's apparently [[Goth subculture|Goth]] lifestyle also drew attacks and mockery from users on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], [[TV Tropes]], [[LiveJournal]], [[Something Awful]], [[YTMND]], and [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt;

Rob Bricken of [[io9]] described the work as a "masterpiece of weirdness" and a "masterpiece of literary disaster".&lt;ref name="io9"/&gt; Mathilda Gregory of [[BuzzFeed]] called ''My Immortal'' a "work of comic genius" that is "oddly touching."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/mathildia/he-put-his-boys-thingy-in-mine|title=The Gloriously Immortal Life of “My Immortal”|last=Gregory|first=Mathilda|date=February 19, 2016|website=|publisher=[[BuzzFeed]]|accessdate=August 20, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916070128/https://www.buzzfeed.com/mathildia/he-put-his-boys-thingy-in-mine|archivedate=September 16, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
The work is often cited as the worst fan fiction ever written&lt;ref name="Vulture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TheVerge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TheMarySue"/&gt; or at least a "strong contender" for the title.&lt;ref name="DailyDot"/&gt; The work is considered "iconic" not only within the [[Harry Potter fandom|''Harry Potter'' fandom]] but also within the larger fan fiction community.&lt;ref name="DailyDot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TheMarySue" /&gt; 

The infamy of the work is considered a "constant millstone around the necks of fanfiction enthusiasts who struggle to bring legitimacy to the genre".&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt; Christo claimed in September 2017 that ''My Immortal'' is a work of satire, though any evidence of this is tied to her own claims of authorship.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/09/my-immortal-rose-christo-under-the-same-stars.html|title=Alleged Author of Legendarily Bad Fanfic ‘My Immortal’ Steps Forward, Announces Book Deal|last=Reisman |first=Abraham |date=September 7, 2017|publisher=[[Vulture (website) |Vulture]]|access-date=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Derivative works===
''My Immortal'' inspired further [[fan work]]s, including [[fan art]] and further fan fiction. It was the subject of numerous [[YouTube]] [[dramatic reading]]s intending to mock the work,&lt;ref name="Vulture"/&gt; and it later inspired a fifteen-episode web series satirizing the work.&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyDot" /&gt;

The '''Ontario Handweavers &amp; Spinners''' (OHS) is a non-profit organization based in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] that helps individuals interested in the fiber crafts to communicate and develop their skills, including [[weaving]], [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and [[Dye|dying]], [[Basket weaving|basket makers]], [[braid]]ers, tablet weavers and paper makers. The OHS communicates to its members through a quarterly [[newsletter]], ''Fibre Focus'', provides [[educational]] programs in spinning and weaving, provides [[scholarships]] and organizes several seminars or conferences each year.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.ohs.on.ca/ "Ontario Handweavers &amp; Spinners website"] OHS. Retrieved 28 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
On 8-9 April 1955 a meeting of 135 members of Ontario weaving guilds was held at the [[Heliconian Club]]. The noted New York weaver [[Berta Frey]] gave a talk and demonstrated putting on a multicolored warp. The group formed an advisory committee to look into setting up a provincial organization, leading to the foundation of the Ontario Handweavers and Spinners the next year.&lt;ref name=Norris1979&gt;{{Citation | last = Norris | first =  Compiled by J.A. | year = 1979|page=4ff

At the time there was increasing interest in reviving traditional [[craft]] skills.&lt;ref name=Alfoldy2005&gt;{{Citation  | last = Alfoldy | first =  Sandra | year = 2005 | title = Crafting Identity : the development of professional fine craft in Canada (p51) | isbn = 978-0-7735-2860-4 | publisher = McGill-Queen's University Press | location = Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1986 the [[Handweavers Guild of America]] held ''Convergence '86'' in Toronto, Canada, its first biennial meeting outside the U.S. 
The conference was co-hosted by the [[Ontario Crafts Council]] and the Ontario Handweavers &amp; Spinners.
About 2,000 weavers and spinners attended the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=xvii |last=Crawford|first=Gail|title=A Fine Line: Studio Crafts in Ontario from 1930 to the Present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4l6V1PBHhyUC&amp;pg=PA216|accessdate=2014-08-07|year=1998|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1-55002-303-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1998 the organization had grown to over 1,000 members, in over 70 [[guilds]] within six autonomous regions in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Crawford | first =  Gail | year = 1998

The owner of the necklace (see on the left) was probably under the protection of [[Virgin Mary]], who is portrayed on both central medallions. It is possible that [[Peter I of Bulgaria]] gave this beautiful jewelry as a wedding gift to his bride, [[Irene Lekapene]], the [[Byzantine]] princess, in 927 in [[Constantinople]]. It is assumed that the necklace was a wedding present because the images of water-birds symbolize family happiness and fidelity.

[[File:Mildenhall treasure great dish british museum.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|The Great Dish, or Great Plate of Bacchus, from the Roman [[Mildenhall Treasure]]]]

'''''Repoussé''''' or '''''repoussage''''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁəpuse|-|fr-repoussé.ogg}}; {{IPA-fr|ʁəpusaʒ||fr-repoussage.ogg}} respectively) is a [[metalworking]] technique in which a [[malleable]] [[metal]] is ornamented or shaped by [[hammer]]ing from the reverse side to create a design in [[low relief]]. It is a form of [[toreutics]].

There are few techniques that offer such diversity of expression while still being relatively economical. ''Chasing'' is the opposite of repoussé, and the two are used in conjunction to create a finished piece. It is also known as ''embossing''.

While ''repoussé'' is used to work on the reverse of the metal to form a raised design on the front, chasing is used to refine the design on the front of the work by sinking the metal. The term chasing is derived from the noun "chase", which refers to a groove, furrow, channel, or indentation. The adjectival form is "chased work".

The techniques of repoussé and chasing use the [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] of metal, forming shapes by degrees. There is no loss of metal in the process as it is stretched locally and the surface remains continuous. The process is relatively slow but a maximum of form is achieved, with one continuous surface of sheet metal of essentially the same thickness. Direct contact of the tools used is usually visible in the result, a condition not always apparent in other techniques, where all evidence of the working method is eliminated.

==Etymology==
The word ''repoussé'' is [[French language|French]] and means "pushed up", ultimately from {{lang-la|pulsare}}, which means "to push". Repoussage is the [[noun]] to refer to the technique, with ''repoussé'' being an [[adjective]] referring to a piece to which the technique has been applied (e.g. "''repoussé'' work", "''repoussé'' piece"). Chasing comes from the French word, ''chasser'' meaning to drive out, or to chase around which is what the artists are doing as they "chase" the forms on their metal in order to create their final design.

== Works ==

An example from antiquity is the late [[Eighteenth Dynasty]] mummy mask of [[Tutankhamun]]. The lapis lazuli and other stones were inlaid in chased areas after the height of the form was completed. The majority of the mask was formed using the technique of repoussé from what appears to be a single sheet of gold (the ceremonial beard, [[Nekhbet]] vulture, and [[Uraeus]] were attached separately). The [[Warren Cup]] is a Roman silver cup, and the [[Mildenhall Treasure]], the [[Hoxne Hoard]], the [[Water Newton Treasure]] and the [[Berthouville Treasure]] are examples of [[hoard]]s of Roman silver found in [[England]] and northern [[France]] with many pieces using these techniques. The prehistoric [[Gundestrup cauldron]] has [[relief]] panels on separate thin sheets on both the inside and outside.

The largest known [[sculpture]] created with this technique is the [[Statue of Liberty]], properly ''Liberté éclairant le monde,'' which translates as ''"Liberty Enlightening The World",'' in [[Upper New York Bay]]. The statue was formed by [[copper]] repoussé in sections using wooden structures to shape each piece during the  hammering process. A second example of monumental [[copper]] repoussé sculpture is [[Portlandia (statue)|''Portlandia'']] by [[Raymond Kaskey]], which was installed in 1985 in downtown [[Portland, Oregon]].

== History ==
[[Image:16th Century Tibet repousse.jpg|thumb|Gilt copper repoussé from Tibet, 16th century]]
The techniques of repoussé date from Antiquity and have been used widely with [[gold]] and [[silver]] for fine detailed work and with [[copper]], [[tin]], and [[bronze]] for larger sculptures. Classical pieces using this technique include the [[bronze]] [[Greece|Greek]] armour plates from the 3rd century BC.

During the 3rd millennium BC, in the Middle East, a variety of semi-mass production methods were introduced to avoid repetitive free-hand work. With the simplest technique, sheet gold could be pressed into designs carved in ''intaglio'' in stone, bone, metal or even materials such as [[jet (lignite)|jet]].  The gold could be worked into the designs with wood tools or, more commonly, by hammering a wax or lead "force" over it.

 |title=Chalice with Apostles Venerating the Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walters Art Museum.]]
The alternative to pressing gold sheet into a die is to work it over a design in cameo relief.  Here the detail would be greater on the back of the final design, so some final chasing from the front was often carried out to sharpen the detail. The use of patterned punches dates back to the first half of the [[2nd millennium BC]], if not far earlier. The simplest patterned punches were produced by loops or scrolls of wire. By [[Hellenistic]] times, combined punches and dies were in use.

In 1400 BC, the Egyptian [[Amarna]] period, resin and mud for repoussé backing was in use.  In 400 BC, the Greeks were using Beeswax for filler in repoussé.

Repoussé and chasing are commonly used in [[India]] to create objects such as water vessels. These vessels are generally made using sheets of [[copper]] or [[silver]].

During the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] and [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] periods of the American [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] goods of repoussé copper were fashioned as ritual regalia and eventually used in prestige burials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Power | first = Susan | title = Early Art of the Southeastern Indians-Feathered Serpents and Winged Beings | publisher = [[University of Georgia Press]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8203-2501-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples have been found with many S.E.C.C. designs such as [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Motifs|Bi-lobed arrow motif]] headdresses and [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Birdman|falcon dancer]] plaques. Although examples have been found in a widely scattered area ([[Spiro Mounds|Spiro]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Etowah plates|Etowah]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]], [[Alabama]]), most are in what is known as the ''[[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Mississippian Ideological Interaction Sphere horizons|Braden Style]]'', thought to have originated at the [[Cahokia]] Site in [[Collinsville, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editors=F.

== Methods ==
[[Image:Maurice Ascalon 2.jpg|thumb|Sculptor [[Maurice Ascalon]] at work undertaking the finishing chasing of a copper repoussé relief sculpture circa 1939.]]

It can be laborious to create jewellery or art using repoussé and chasing techniques, although with practice, complex and delicate pieces can be made which would be virtually impossible to complete using any other method.

Several different metals are used for chasing and repousse work, including drawn steel, silicon bronze, copper, gold, silver and pewter.

The process of chasing / repousse takes a lot of time due to the repetition of a number of time-consuming stages:  The first step is the preparation of the metal by [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]; cleaning to remove the [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] between annealing and work; setting up; and careful work with punches.  This process is typically repeated many times during the creation of a chasing/repousse work.

One method of repoussé and chasing is to place a thin sheet of metal on a bowl of chasers pitch. This chasers pitch can be pine rosin–based that can be kept slightly soft with a heat gun or plumbers torch for relief work and hardens when cooled for chasing/planishing work. It can become extremely soft or liquefied when heated too much, becoming somewhat of a burn hazard.  It is not recommended, nor necessary to heat the pitch to this degree.

The purpose of using pitch is to provide a solid base to work on, whilst allowing the metal to be pushed out and shaped without obstruction. The pitch is best worked on in a ''pitch bowl'' or "pitch board."  The pitch bowl is a [[cast iron]] bowl which sits on a bag stuffed with [[sand]] or on a rubber ring specifically made for this purpose.  This allows for greater stability, [[rotation]] and angling.  The pitch is heated using a [[hairdryer]], or an industrial blowdryer. If the pitch is too hard, the metal will be thinned.  If it is too soft, there is very little control over the form. A good medium grade chasers pitch works well because it softens enough to allow for satisfactory relief and cools to a firmness that is sufficient for chasing, planishing and detail work.

[[File:Repujado- caballo griego alestilo del período geométrico, por el artista mexicano Manolo Vega, 2011.jpg|left|thumb|Repoussè on tin sheet – "Greek horse" by Mexican artist Manolo Vega, 2011]] 
   
[[Steel]] [[tool]]s are used to work the metal. A "liner" is a steel tool/punch with a very thin, slightly rounded end, that is used to create the initial lines on the metal. The liner is hit on the end with a ''chasing hammer'', pushing a thin line of metal into the pitch. The side facing up will consequently be the front of the piece. Once all the lines have been chased, the metal is then turned over on the pitch, and repoussé technique is then applied, using other various steel punches/tools to push the metal so that it is raised on the front of the finished piece.

Once the design has been raised and the repousse is done, the piece is inverted and the voids are filled with warm pitch to help maintain its shape. The pitch should be allowed to set in the voids and cool before the piece is turned over and placed back on the pitch. Once the piece of metal is turned over and then chased, in that the details are refined and brought out. The design is worked many times, with numerous tools, before the final result is achieved.

Every time the metal is removed from the pitch bowl, it needs to be cleaned and re-annealed. [[Turpentine]] is used to remove the pitch, and a blow torch can also be used to burn it off.

== Tools ==

There are hundreds of tools which can be used. They are generally made by the jeweller/crafts person.  They are typically made from bars of ''[[tool steel]]'', which is [[forge]]d and [[tempering (metallurgy)|tempered]] at the tip.  These hardened steel punches may be purchased by a supplier, but the specialized punches are made by the jeweler or special ordered to suit a particular design.&lt;ref name=Bowie&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowie|first=Hamish|title=Jewelry Making|year=1977|publisher=Henry Regnery Company|location=Chicago|isbn=0-8092-8084-1|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[saw]] can be used to cut designs into the tip for making patterns, or the tool can be hammered onto a patterned surface, which will indent the tip. The end of the tool which is to be hammered should be bevelled to allow for expansion of the metal from repeated hammering. Some of the main styles of tool include: ''Liners'', ''planishers'', ''matting'', and ''doming''. Liners have thin tips, which are slightly rounded.  If they are too thin they will cut the metal. They are used in the initial marking out of the design, and in the finishing stages to refine any thin outlines.  Planishers have  smooth, flat tips which are used for pushing out large, flat areas of metal. Matting tools have patterns cut into them, and provide detail to areas of the design.  Matting tools can also be made by filing a thin line around a steel bar, hardening it, then snapping it.  This will result in a fine grain pattern. Doming tools push out rounded areas of metal, and can either be round or oval, quite pointed or almost flat. An [[oxyacetylene]] torch, coal forge or propane forge is required for heating the steel sufficiently for forging. The more tools available, the easier it is to create a detailed, accurate piece.

== Recipes for pitch ==
The [[traditional]] working surface is chaser's pitch which is usually a [[wikt:composition|composition]] combining three substances: pure pitch, a ''filler'' (or stiffener), and an ''[[emollient]]'' (softening medium). There are a number of different recipes for making chaser's pitch. One example is:

*16 parts [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]]
*20 parts [[plaster of Paris]]
*4 parts [[resin]]
*1 part [[tallow]]

The pitch is heated until molten.  Plaster of Paris is added a small amount at a time.  Resin and tallow are then mixed in.

Pitch is backing and filler material, preferably rosin-based, but also petroleum-based, used by metalsmiths to hold the metal in place while working it.

There is a flexible pitch used by chasers referred to as Swedish pitch.

There are other pitch choices, with two very popular choices being Red (or sometimes referred to as brown) German Pitch and a versatile medium (grade/hardness) dark green chasers pitch.  There is also a black pitch.

The different pitches are used preferentially and according to the type of chasing and repousse work being done.

This pitch material can be re-used indefinitely if used and stored properly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56827">The '''SCO–Linux disputes''' are a series of legal and public disputes between the [[software]] company [[SCO Group]] (SCO) and various [[Linux]] vendors and users.  The SCO Group alleges that its license agreements with IBM means that [[source code]] that IBM wrote and donated to be incorporated into Linux was added in violation of SCO's contractual rights.  Members of the Linux community disagree with SCO's claims; [[IBM]], [[Novell]] and [[Red Hat]] have ongoing claims against SCO.

On August 10, 2007, a federal district court judge in ''SCO v.

The court also ruled that "SCO is obligated to recognize Novell's waiver of SCO's claims against IBM and Sequent".

{{SCO Controversy}}

==Overview==
[[Unix]] is a major computer [[operating system]], developed in the [[United States of America]].  Prior to the events of this case, the [[intellectual property rights]] (IP) in Unix were held by [[Unix System Laboratories]] (USL), part of [[AT&amp;T]], but the area of IP ownership was complex.  By 2003, the rights in Unix had been transferred several times and there was dispute as to the correct owner in law. Also some of the code within Unix had been written prior to the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], or was developed by third parties, or was developed or licensed under different licenses existing at the time. The [[software]] company [[SCO Group]] (SCO), formerly [[Caldera International]], asserted in 2003 that it was the owner of Unix, and that other unix-type operating systems - particularly the [[free software|free operating system]] [[Linux]] and other variants of Unix sold by competitor companies - were violating their intellectual property by using Unix code without a license in their works.

SCO initially claimed, and tried to assert, a legal means to litigate directly against all end-users of these operating systems as well as the companies or groups providing them - potentially a very substantial case and one that would [[Fear, uncertainty and doubt|throw fear]] into the market about using them.  However it was unable to formulate such a case, since the Unix copyrights were weakly worded, there was no basis in patent law, and breach of trade secrets would only affect the one or few companies who might have been alleged to have disclosed trade secrets.  Lacking grounds to sue all users generally, SCO dropped this aspect of its cases.

The assertions were heavily contested. Claims of SCO's own copyright violations of these other systems were raised, along with claims related to SCO being bound by, or violating, the [[GPL]] licence, under which SCO conducted business related to these systems. Claims were also made that the case was substantially financed and promoted by [[Microsoft]] and investment businesses with links to Microsoft; around that time (1998 - 2004 onwards) Microsoft was fiercely engaged in various [[Fear, uncertainty and doubt|FUD]] tactics such as its ''Get the facts'' campaign, that sought to undermine or discredit Linux as a possible competitor to its own [[Windows]] operating systems and server systems.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Microsoft Halloween documents leak]] for more detail&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Microsoft takes on the free world | url = http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100033867/ | publisher = [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] via [[CNNMoney.com]] | first = Roger | last = Parloff | date = 2007-05-14 | accessdate = 2007-11-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071109190233/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100033867/ | archivedate = 2007-11-09 | df =  }}.

In the end, SCO launched only a few main legal cases - against [[IBM]] for improper disclosure and breach of copyright related to its [[AIX]] operating system, against [[Novell]] for interference (clouding the issue of ownership), against [[DaimlerChrysler]] for non-compliance with a demand to certify certain matters related to Unix usage, and against Linux business and former client [[AutoZone]] for violating SCO's rights by using Linux.  Separately, the Linux company [[Red Hat]] also filed a legal claim against SCO for making false claims that affected its (Red Hat's) business, and to seek a court declaration that SCO had no ownership rights in Linux code.

In 2007, a court ruled in ''SCO v. Novell'' that Novell and not SCO was the owner of the Unix copyrights. {{As of|2016}}, most of these cases have been resolved, or largely resolved, and none of the rulings have been in SCO's favor.

==Timeline and major cases==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2010}}
At the beginning of 2003, SCO claimed that there had been "misappropriation of its [[UNIX System V]] [[Source code|code]] into Linux". However, the company refused to identify the specific segments of code, claiming that it was a secret which they would reveal only to the court. They did say that the code could be found in the [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]], [[Read-copy-update|RCU]] and a few other parts of the [[Linux kernel]].

On 6 March 2003 they announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1016-991464.html|title=SCO sues Big Blue over Unix, Linux|date=11 March 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that they were suing IBM for $1&amp;nbsp;billion, claiming that IBM transferred SCO [[trade secret]]s into Linux. That amount later rose to $3&amp;nbsp;billion, and then again to $5 billion.

Some educated parties{{Who|date=March 2011}} note that the ''[[USL v. BSDi]]'' case had shown that the Unix copyrights are weak and unenforceable. SCO has not claimed [[patent infringement]], as according to the [[US Patent and Trademark Office]] database, no [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] or Novell patent was ever assigned to SCO. The UNIX [[trademark]] was not owned by SCO. That left arguing over trade secrets, which after some opposition, was hard to take beyond a breach of contract between SCO and IBM, and consequentially a claim only against IBM. SCO was looking for something directed at the greater Linux community, and has since explicitly dropped all trade secret claims from their case.

SCO now had little legal ground at this point and therefore began numerous legal claims and threats against many of the major names in the computer industry, including IBM, [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Microsoft]], Novell, [[Silicon Graphics]], [[Sun Microsystems]] and Red Hat.

By mid-2004, five major lawsuits had been filed:

* ''[[SCO v. IBM]]''
* ''[[Red Hat v. SCO]]''
* ''[[SCO v. Novell]]'' (not directly related to Linux, the suit has more to do with Unix copyrights)
* ''[[SCO v. DaimlerChrysler]]''
* ''[[SCO-Linux controversies#SCO v. AutoZone|SCO v. AutoZone]]''

In cases SCO publicly implied that a number of other parties have committed copyright infringement, including not only Linux developers but also Linux users.

==UNIX SVRx==
SCO's claims are derived from several contracts that may have transferred UNIX System V Release 4 intellectual property assets.  The UNIX IP rights originated with [[Unix System Laboratories]] (USL), a division of AT&amp;T.  In 1993, USL sold all UNIX rights and assets to Novell, including copyrights, trademarks, and active licensing contracts. Some of these rights and assets, plus additional assets derived from Novell's development work, were then sold to the [[Santa Cruz Operation]] in 1995.  The Santa Cruz Operation had developed and was selling a PC-based UNIX until 2000, when it then resold its UNIX assets to [[Caldera Systems]], which later reorganized into [[Caldera International]] and changed its name to [[SCO Group]].

Through this chain of sales, SCO claims to be the "owner of UNIX". The validity of these claims is hotly contested by others. SCO claims copyright to all UNIX code developed by USL, referred to as [[UNIX System V|SVRx]], and licensing contracts originating with AT&amp;T, saying that these are inherited through the same chain of sales. The primary document SCO presents as evidence of these claims is the "Asset Purchase Agreement",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/SCONovellAssetAg.pdf|title=in the original] or [http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=2003111023050367&amp;query=asset+purchase+agreement transcribed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defining the sale between Novell and the Santa Cruz Operation. SCO says that this includes all copyrights to the UNIX code base and contractual rights to the licensing base. The other parties disagree.

===UNIX copyrights ownership===
The status of copyrights from USL is murky, since UNIX code is a compilation of elements with different copyright histories.  Some code was released without copyright notice before the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] made copyright automatic.  This code may be in the [[public domain]] and not subject to copyright claims.  Other code is affected by the ''[[USL v. BSDi]]'' case, and is covered by the [[BSD License]].

[[Groklaw]] uncovered an old settlement made between Unix System Laboratories (USL) and The University of California in the case of [[USL v. BSDi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/USLsettlement.pdf|title=The full settlement available from Groklaw's website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This settlement ended a copyright infringement suit against the University for making [[BSD]] [[source code]] freely available that USL felt infringed their copyrights. The university filed a counter suit, saying that USL had taken BSD source code and put it in UNIX without properly acknowledging the university's copyright. This settlement muddies the question of SCO's ownership of major parts of the UNIX source code. This uncertainty is particularly significant in regard to SCO's claims against Linux, which uses some BSD code.

Novell challenges SCO's interpretation of the purchase agreement.  In response to a letter SCO sent to 1500 companies on May 12, 2003,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novell.com/licensing/indemnity/pdf/5_12_03_sco-n.pdf May 12, 2003 letter to Novell Chairman and CEO Jack Messman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040717052204/http://www.novell.com/licensing/indemnity/pdf/5_12_03_sco-n.pdf |date=July 17, 2004 }} hosted by Novell.&lt;/ref&gt; Novell exchanged a series of letters&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novell.com/licensing/indemnity/legal.html Novell's Unique Legal Rights&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040806125142/http://www.novell.com/licensing/indemnity/legal.html |date=August 6, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with SCO beginning in May 2003, claiming that the copyrights for the core UNIX System V were not included in the asset purchase agreement and are retained by Novell.  In October 2003, Novell registered those copyrights with the US Copyright Office.

In response to these challenges from Novell, SCO filed a "[[slander of title]]" suit against Novell, ''[[SCO v. Novell]]''.  This claimed that Novell was interfering with their business activities by clouding the ownership of UNIX copyrights. SCO's claim for special damages was dismissed on June 9, 2004 for "failure to specifically plead special damages."&lt;ref name="kimbal_order"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/Novell-29.pdf|title=Judge Kimbal's Order available from Groklaw's website|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, SCO was given 30 days "to amend its complaint to more specifically plead special damages". In the same ruling,  the judge stated that it was questionable whether or not the Asset Purchase Agreement transferred the relevant copyrights, reasoning that the ASA amendment by which SCO was claiming to have acquired those rights contained no transfer language in the form of "seller hereby conveys to buyer" and that it used ambiguous language when it came to the question of when and how and which rights were to be transferred.&lt;ref name="kimbal_order" /&gt;{{rp|9}}

SCO filed an amended complaint. In late July, 2005, Novell filed an answer to SCO's complaint, denying all of its accusations. Novell also filed its own Slander of Title counter-lawsuit against SCO. Novell has also filed claims for numerous breaches of the APA (Asset Purchase Agreement) between Novell and the [[Santa Cruz Operation]]. Under the APA, Santa Cruz (and later SCO after SCO purchased Santa Cruz Operation's Unix Business) was given the right to market and sell Unixware as a product, retaining 100% of all revenues. Santa Cruz Operation (and later SCO) also was given the responsibility of administering Unix SVR4 license agreements on behalf of Novell. When money was paid for licensing, SCO was to turn over 100% of the revenue to Novell, and then Novell would return 5% as an Administration Fee. Novell claims that SCO signed Unix SVR4 licensing agreements with Microsoft and Sun Microsystems, as well as with numerous Linux End Users for Unix IP allegedly in the Linux Kernel, and then refused to turn the money over to Novell. Novell is suing for 100% of the revenue, claiming SCO is not entitled to the 5% administration fee since they breached their contract with Novell. Novell's counterclaims proposed asking the court to put appropriate funds from SCO into escrow until the case is resolved, since SCO's cash is diminishing quickly.

Novell also retained the right to audit SCO's Unix Licensing Business under the APA. Novell claims that SCO has not turned over vital information about the Microsoft, Sun, and Linux End User License Agreements, despite repeated demands by Novell for them to do so. Novell, in another claim that is part of their counter suit, is asking the court to compel SCO to allow Novell to perform this audit of SCO's Unix Business.

On August 10, 2007 Judge Dale Kimball, hearing the SCO v. Novell case, ruled that "...the court concludes that Novell is the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare Copyrights".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/Novell/Novell-377.pdf|title=Memorandum order and decision, document 377 in case 2:04CV139DAK], the court order on [[Groklaw]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="novell379"&gt;[https://www.novell.com/communities/coolsolutions/novell-statement-on-todays-sco-ruling/ Novell statement on today’s SCO ruling], Novell Open PR, 2007-08-10&lt;/ref&gt;

===License administration standing===
The Novell to Santa Cruz Operation Asset Purchase Agreement also involved the administration of some 6000 standing licensing agreements between various UNIX users and the previous owners.  These licensees include universities, software corporations and computer hardware companies. SCO's claimed ownership of the licenses has become an issue in three aspects of the SCO–Linux controversies. The first was the cancellation of IBM's license, the second was SCO's complaint against DaimlerChrysler (see ''[[SCO v. DaimlerChrysler]]''), and the third is the derivative works claim of the ''[[SCO v. IBM]]'' case.

In May 2003, SCO canceled IBM's SVRx license to its version of UNIX, [[AIX operating system|AIX]].  This was based on SCO's claim of unrestricted ownership of the System V licensing contracts inherited from USL. IBM ignored the license cancellation, claiming that an amendment to the original license&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20031107212034397|title=Groklaw - Amendment X as Text|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; made it "irrevocable."  In addition, as part of the Purchase Agreement, Novell retained certain rights of control over the administration of the licenses which were sold, including rights to act on SCO's behalf in some cases.  Novell exercised one of these rights by revoking SCO's cancellation of the IBM license.  SCO disputed the validity of both of these actions, and amended its ''SCO v. IBM'' complaint to include copyright infringement, based on IBM's continued sale and use of AIX without a valid SVRx license.

In December 2003, SCO demanded that all UNIX licensees certify some items, some related to the use of Linux, that were not provided for in the license agreement language.  Since DaimlerChrysler failed to respond, SCO filed the ''SCO v. DaimlerChrysler'' suit in March 2004.  All claims related to the certification demands were summarily dismissed by the court.

===Control of derivative works===
The third issue based on the UNIX licensees agreement is related to SCO's claims of control of derivative works.

Many UNIX licensees have added features to the core UNIX SVRx system and those new features contain computer code not in the original SVRx code base. In most cases, software copyright is owned by the person or company that develops the code. SCO, however, claims that the original licensing agreements define this new code as a [[derivative work]]. They also claim that they have the right to control and restrict the use and distribution of that new code.

These claims are the basis of ''SCO v. IBM''. SCO's initial complaint,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/IBM/complaint3.06.03.html|title=The SCO Group v|website=sco.tuxrocks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that IBM violated the original licensing agreement by not maintaining confidentiality with the new code, developed and copyrighted by IBM, and releasing it to the Linux project.

IBM claims that the license agreement (noted in the $Echo newsletter of April 1985)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040211153230800|title=Groklaw - $ echo  April 1985|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent licenses defines derivative works as the developer's property.  This leaves IBM free to do as it wishes with its new code.  In August 2004, IBM filed a motion for partial summary judgment.  The motion stated that IBM has the right to do as it wishes with software not part of the original SVRx code. In February 2005, the motion was dismissed as premature, because discovery was not yet complete. IBM refiled this motion along with other summary judgment motions as noted below in September 2006.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}&lt;!--WP:WEIGHT?--&gt;

===SCO allegations of copyright and trade secret violations===
SCO claims that Linux infringes SCO's [[copyright]], [[trade secrets]], and contractual rights. This claim is fundamental to the [[SCOsource]] program, where SCO has demanded that Linux users obtain licenses from SCOsource to be properly licensed to use the code in question. Exactly which parts of Linux are involved remains unclear as many of their claims are still under seal in the ''SCO v. IBM'' lawsuit.

SCO originally claimed in ''SCO v. IBM'' that IBM had violated trade secrets. But these alleged violations by IBM would not have involved Linux distributors or end users. SCO's trade secret claims were dropped by SCO in their amended complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/IBM/Doc-25.html|title=The SCO Group v|website=sco.tuxrocks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCO also claimed line-for-line literal copying of code from UNIX code files to Linux kernel files and obfuscated copying of code, but originally refused to publicly identify which code was in violation.  SCO submitted to the court evidence of their claims under seal but much of it was excluded from the case after it was challenged by IBM as not meeting the specificity requirements to be included.

These examples have fallen into two groups.  The first are segments of files or whole files alleged to originate in UNIX SVRx code such as the [[errno.h]] header file. The second group are files and materials contributed by IBM that originated with IBM development work associated with AIX and [[Dynix]], IBM's two UNIX products.

Each of these has a different set of issues. In order for copyright to be violated, several conditions must be met. First, the claimant must be able to show that they own the copyrights for the material in question. Second, all or a significant part of the source must be present in the infringing material. There must be enough similarity to show direct copying of material.

====SVRx code allegedly in Linux====
The issue of ownership of the SVRx code base was discussed [[SCO-Linux controversies#UNIX SVRx|above]].  Besides the unresolved issue of what was actually transferred from Novell to Santa Cruz Operation, there are also the portions of the SVRx code base that are covered by BSD copyrights or that are in the public domain.

SCO's first public disclosure of what they claim is infringing code was at [[The SCO Group#History|SCO Forum]] in August 2003.  The first, known as the [[Berkeley Packet Filter]], was distributed under the BSD License and is freely usable by anyone.  The second example was related to memory allocation functions, also released under the BSD License. It is no longer in the Linux code base.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Perens, [http://perens.com/Articles/SCO/SCOSlideShow.html Analysis of SCO's Las Vegas Slide Show]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406055034/http://perens.com/Articles/SCO/SCOSlideShow.html |date=April 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCO has also claimed that code related to [[application programming interface]]s was copied from UNIX.  However, this code and the underlying standards they describe are in the public domain and are also covered by rights USL sold to [[The Open Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Perens, [http://www.zdnet.com.au/insight/software/0,39023769,39116509,00.htm SCO's failing case against IBM], zdnet.com.au, March 10, 2004. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050213234612/http://www.zdnet.com.au/insight/software/0,39023769,39116509,00.htm |date=February 13, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A later claim was made to code segments related to [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]] file format standards.  This material was developed by the Tool Interface Standard (TIS) Committee and placed in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040722135616439|title=Groklaw - A Tall Tale About ELF - by Frank Sorenson, Dr Stupid and PJ|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SCO claims that the TIS Committee had no authority to place ELF in the public domain, even though SCO's predecessor in interest was a member of the committee.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

SCO has claimed that some are violating UNIX SVRx copyrights by putting UNIX code into Linux.  They may or may not have brought this claim directly in any of their cases.  The IBM case is about derivative works, not SVRx code (see below).  The Novell case is about copyright ownership.  DaimlerChrysler was about contractual compliance statements.

The "may or may not" comes from AutoZone's case.{{Original research inline|date=September 2007}}  In AutoZone, SCO's complaint claimed damages for AutoZone's use of Linux.  However, when objecting to AutoZone's request for a stay pending the IBM case, SCO apparently contradicted their written complaint, claiming that the case was entirely about AutoZone copying certain libraries (outside the Linux kernel) from a UNIX system to a Linux-based system to facilitate moving an internal application to the Linux platform faster; SCO's original complaint does not appear to mention these libraries.  AutoZone denies having done this with UNIX libraries.  If SCO's oral description of their case is the correct one, then their AutoZone claim has nothing to do with the Linux kernel or the actions of any distributors.

The copyright issue is addressed directly in two of the cases. The first is by IBM in their counterclaim in ''SCO v. IBM''.  The issue is central to a pending motion by IBM, stating that IBM violated no copyrights in its Linux related activities.  It is also addressed by Red Hat in the Red Hat v. SCO case.  Red Hat claims that SCO's statements about infringement in Linux are unproven and untrue, damaging to them and violates the [[Lanham Act]].  Red Hat asks for an injunction to stop claims of violations without proof.  They also ask for a judgment that they violated no SCO copyrights.  A hearing on the IBM motion was held on September 15, 2004. Judge Kimball took the motion under advisement. The Red Hat case is on hold.

====Allegations of reverse copying====
''EWeek'' has reported allegations that SCO may have copied parts of the Linux kernel into SCO UNIX as part of its Linux Kernel Personality feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1653684,00.asp|title=HP TouchPad Needs 6 to 8 Weeks for Additional Shipments|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If true, this would mean that SCO is guilty of a breach of the Linux kernel copyrights. SCO has denied this allegation, but according to Groklaw, one SCO employee confirmed it in a deposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050809082902461|title=Groklaw -  Erik Hughes Deposition:  LKP Did Include Linux Kernel Code|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====IBM code in Linux====
SCO has claimed a number of instances of IBM Linux code as breaches of contract. These examples include code related to [[Symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP), [[Journaled File System]] (JFS), [[Read-copy-update]] (RCU) and [[Non-Uniform Memory Access]] (NUMA). This code is questionably in the Linux kernel,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} and may have been added by IBM through the normal kernel submission process. This code was developed and copyrighted by IBM. IBM added features to AIX and Dynix.

SCO claims that they have "control rights" to this due to their licensing agreements with IBM. SCO disavows claiming that they own the code IBM wrote, rather comparing their "control rights" to an [[easement]], rights which allow them to prohibit IBM from publicizing the code they wrote, even though IBM owns the copyrights. They base this claim on language in the original license agreement that requires non-disclosure of the code and claim that  all code developed by UNIX licensees that is used with the code under license be held in confidence. This claim is discussed above at [[#Control of derivative works|Control of derivative works]].

===SCO and the GPL===
Before changing their name to the SCO Group, the company was known as '''Caldera International'''.

[[Caldera (company)|Caldera]] was one of the major distributors of Linux between 1994 and 1998. In August 1998, the company split into [[Caldera Systems]] and [[Caldera Thin Clients]], with Caldera Systems taking over the Linux systems business and Caldera Thin Clients concentrating on the Thin Clients and embedded business. The parent and shell company Caldera, Inc. ceased to exist in 2000 after a settlement with Microsoft in the [[Caldera v. Microsoft]] lawsuit.

Caldera Systems was reorganized to become Caldera International in 2001, the company, which was renamed to [[The SCO Group]] in 2002.

Some, like [[Eben Moglen]],&lt;ref name="fsf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsf.org/licensing/sco/sco-v-ibm.html|title=FSF Statement on SCO v. IBM|date=2003-06-27|author=Moglen, Eben|publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]], Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that because Caldera{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;!-- TBD: Please be specific about which of the various Caldera companies is meant here --&gt; distributed the allegedly infringing code under the [[GNU General Public License]], or GPL, that this act would license any proprietary code in Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/2207791|title=SCO Faces Hurdles in Linux Claims - InternetNews.|website=www.internetnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCO has stated that they did not know their own code was in Linux, so releasing it under the GPL does not count. However, as late as July and August 2006, long after that claim was made, they were still distributing ELF files (the subject of one of SCO's claims regarding SVRx) under the GPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060731122623203|title=Groklaw - SCO is Distributing ELF Under the GPL Still. Yes.  Now. Today.|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060806074745174|title=Groklaw - SCO  Is Still Distributing ELF Under the GPL, Part 2.|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCO has also claimed, in early stages of the litigation, that the GPL is invalid and non-binding and legally unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1404984,00.asp|title=HP TouchPad Needs 6 to 8 Weeks for Additional Shipments|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, supporters of the GPL, such as Eben Moglen, claimed that SCO's right to distribute Linux relied upon the GPL being a valid copyright license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetnews.com/ent-news/article.php/3302801|title=GPL Awaits Test in SCO Group/IBM Dispute - InternetNews.|website=www.internetnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later court filings by the SCO Group in ''SCO v. IBM'' use SCO's alleged compliance with the license as a defense to IBM's counterclaims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=2007020910561488|title=Groklaw - SCO's Memo in Opp. to IBM's Motion for SJ on Claim of Copyright Infringement|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GPL has become an issue in ''SCO v. IBM''. Under U.S. copyright law, distribution of creative works whose copyright is owned by another party is illegal without permission from the copyright owner, usually in the form of a license; the GPL is such a license, and thus allows distribution, but only under limited conditions. Since IBM released the relevant code under the terms of the GPL, it claims that the only permission that SCO has to copy and distribute IBM's code in Linux is under the terms and conditions of the GPL, one of which requires the distributor to "accept" the GPL. IBM says that SCO violated the GPL by denouncing the GPL's validity, and by claiming that the GPL violates the U.S. Constitution, together with copyright, antitrust and export control laws.  IBM also claims that SCO's SCOsource program is incompatible with the requirement that redistributions of GPLed works must be free of copyright licensing fees (fees may be charged for the acts of duplication and support). IBM has brought counterclaims alleging that SCO has violated the GPL and breached IBM's copyrights by collecting licensing fees while distributing IBM's copyrighted material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040331043539340|title=Groklaw - IBM's Second Amended Counterclaims Lists 9 Newly Registered Copyrights|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- WP:WEIGHT? SCO dropped their GPL-as-unconstitutional claims anyway.--&gt;

==Status of current lawsuits==

===''SCO v. IBM''===
{{Main article|SCO v. IBM}}
On March 7, 2003, SCO filed suit against IBM. Initially this lawsuit was about breach of contract and trade secrets. Later, SCO dropped the trade secrets claim, so the claim is breach of contract. SCO also added a copyright claim related to IBM's continued use of AIX, but not related to Linux. The judge subsequently stated that the SCO Group had indeed made a claim of copyright infringement against IBM regarding Linux. IBM filed multiple counter claims, including charges of both patent violations, which were later dropped, and violation of copyright law.

On February 8, 2005, Judge Kimball ruled that IBM's motions for summary judgment were premature but added:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Viewed against the backdrop of SCO's plethora of public statements concerning IBM's and others' infringement of SCO's purported copyrights to the UNIX software, it is astonishing that SCO has not offered any competent evidence to create a disputed fact regarding whether IBM has infringed SCO's alleged copyrights through IBM's Linux activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050209203941896|title=Groklaw - Kimball Memoradum and Order - as text|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On June 28, 2006 Judge Brooke Wells granted, in part, IBM's motion to limit SCO's claims and excluded 186 of SCO's 294 items of allegedly misused intellectual property (IBM had challenged 201 of them for various reasons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060628175203644|title=Groklaw - Wells Grants in Part IBM's Motion to Limit SCO's Claims!  In *Large* Part.|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells cited a number of factors including SCO's inability to provide sufficient specificity in these claims:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In December 2003, near the beginning of this case, the court ordered SCO to, "identify and state with specificity the source code(s) that SCO is claiming forms the basis of their action against IBM." Even if SCO lacked the code behind methods and concepts at this early stage, SCO could have and should have, at least articulated which methods and concepts formed "the basis of their action against IBM." At a minimum, SCO should have identified the code behind their method and concepts in the final submission pursuant to this original order entered in December 2003 and Judge Kimball’s order entered in July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060628203537917|title=Groklaw - Wells' Order Granting in Part IBM's Motion to Limit SCO's Claims, as text|website=www.groklaw.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This left about 100 of SCO's items of allegedly misused intellectual property (the merits of which have not yet been judged), out of 294 items originally disclosed by SCO.

Following the partial summary judgment rulings in the SCO vs Novell Slander of Title case, Judge Kimball asked&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/IBM-1077.pdf |title=Data |website=www.groklaw.net |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; the parties in SCO v IBM to prepare by August 31, 2007, a statement of the status of this case.

===''Red Hat v. SCO''===
{{Main article|Red Hat v. SCO}}
Red Hat filed suit against SCO on August 4, 2003. Red Hat sued SCO for false advertising, deceptive trade practices and asked for a declaratory judgment of noninfringement of any of SCO's copyrights. This case has been stayed pending resolution of the IBM case.

===''SCO v. Novell''===
{{Main article|SCO v. Novell}}
After SCO initiated their Linux campaign, they said that they were the owners of [[Unix|UNIX]]. Novell claimed these statements were false, and that they still owned the rights in question. After Novell registered the copyrights to some key UNIX products, SCO filed suit against Novell on January 20, 2004.&lt;ref name="novell-0"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://groklaw.net/pdf/Novell-0.pdf | title=SCO's Complaint In the Third Judicial District Court of Salt Lake County, State of Utah | date=2004-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Novell [[removal jurisdiction|removed]] the suit to federal court on February 6, 2004.&lt;ref name="novell-1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://groklaw.net/pdf/Novell-1.pdf | title=Novell's Removal Notice | date=2004-02-06 | publisher=Groklaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 2005, Novell filed its answer with the court, denying SCO's claims. Novell also filed counterclaims asking the court to force SCO to turn over the revenues it had received from UNIX licenses, less a 5% administrative fee. Additionally, Novell asked the court to place the funds in a "constructive trust" in order to ensure that SCO could pay Novell since the company's assets were depleting rapidly.

On August 10, 2007, Judge Dale Kimball, hearing the SCO v. Novell case, ruled that "...the court concludes that Novell is the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare Copyrights". Novell was awarded summary judgments on a number of claims, and a number of SCO claims were denied. SCO was instructed to account for and pass to Novell an appropriate portion of income relating to SCOSource licences to Sun Microsystems and Microsoft. A number of matters are not disposed of by Judge Kimball's ruling, and the outcome of these are still pending.&lt;ref name="doc377" /&gt;&lt;ref name="novell379" /&gt;

On July 16, 2008, the trial court issued an order awarding Novell $2,547,817 and ruled that SCO was not authorized to enter into the 2003 agreement with Sun.&lt;ref name="July 2008"&gt;

On August 24, 2009, the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]] partially reversed the August 10, 2007 district court summary judgment ruling.  The appeals court [[Remand (court procedure)|remand]]ed back to trial on the issues of copyright ownership and Novell's contractual waiver rights.  The court upheld the $2,547,817 award granted to Novell for the 2003 Sun agreement.&lt;ref name="Novell August 2009"&gt;

===''SCO v. AutoZone''===
[[AutoZone]], a corporate user of Linux and former user of SCO OpenServer, was sued by SCO on March 3, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Primary court documents pertaining to this case can be found at [http://sco.tuxrocks.com/?Case=AutoZone http://sco.tuxrocks.com/?Case=AutoZone].&lt;/ref&gt; SCO claims AutoZone violated SCO's copyrights by using Linux. The suit was stayed pending the resolution of the IBM, Red Hat and Novell cases.

On September 26, 2008, Judge Robert C. Jones lifted the stay, effective December 31, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url=http://groklaw.net/article.php?story=20080926054747382  | title=Stay Lifted on AutoZone as of December 31st - Updated  | accessdate=2009-10-23  | date=2008-09-26  | publisher=Groklaw }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He initially scheduled discovery for April 9, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url=http://groklaw.net/article.php?story=20090121182736840  | title=Members Only -- Docket Update - BK and AutoZone  | accessdate=2009-10-23  | date=2009-01-21  | publisher=Groklaw }}&lt;/ref&gt;  SCO filed an amended complaint on August 14, 2009.

===''SCO v. DaimlerChrysler''===
{{Main article|SCO v. DaimlerChrysler}}
In December 2003, SCO demanded that some UNIX licensees certify certain issues regarding their use of Linux. [[DaimlerChrysler]], a former UNIX user and current Linux user, did not respond to this demand. On March 3, 2004 SCO filed suit against DaimlerChrysler for violating their UNIX license agreement by failing to respond to the certification request. Almost every claim SCO made has been ruled against in summary judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Not dismissed, see the [http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/DCHearing-2.pdf hearing transcript, page 15]&lt;/ref&gt; The last remaining issue, that of whether DaimlerChrysler made a timely response, was dismissed by agreement of SCO and DaimlerChrysler in December 2004. SCO retains the right to continue this case at a future date, providing it pays legal fees to DaimlerChrysler.

==Other issues and conflicts==

===SCO announces that it will not sue its own customers===
On June 23, 2003, SCO sent out a letter announcing that it would not be suing its own Linux customers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caldera.com/scosource/letter_to_partners.html The SCO Group, Inc. | Scosource | Letter_to_partners&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041009172817/http://www.caldera.com/scosource/letter_to_partners.html |date=October 9, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the letter, it states:

{{quote|SCO will continue to support our SCO Linux and OpenLinux customers and partners who have previously implemented those products and we will hold them harmless from any SCO intellectual property issues regarding Linux.}}

===SCO and SGI===
In August 2003, SCO presented two examples of what they claimed was illegal copying of copyrighted code from UNIX to Linux. One of the examples ([[Berkeley Packet Filter]]) was not related to original UNIX code at all. The other example did, however, seem to originate from the UNIX code and was apparently contributed by a UNIX vendor, [[Silicon Graphics]]. However, an analysis by the Linux community later revealed that:

* The code originated from an even older version of UNIX which at some point was published by Caldera{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;!-- Please be specific about the date and which of the various Caldera companies is meant here. --&gt;, thus making any claim of copyright infringement shaky.
* The code did not do anything. It was in a part of the Linux kernel that was written in anticipation of a Silicon Graphics architecture that was never released.
* It had already been removed from the kernel two months earlier.
* The contested segment was small (80 lines) and trivial.

===SCO and BayStar Capital===
In October 2003, [[BayStar Capital]] and [[Royal Bank of Canada]] invested US$50 million in The SCO Group to support the legal cost of SCO's Linux campaign. Later it was shown that BayStar was referred to SCO by Microsoft, whose proprietary [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system competes with Linux. In 2003, BayStar looked at SCO on the recommendation of Microsoft, according to Lawrence R. Goldfarb, managing partner of BayStar Capital: "It was evident that Microsoft had an agenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE1DB173AF931A15757C0A9629C8B63&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=TECHNOLOGY; Investor's Pullout Stirs Doubts About SCO Group | first=Steve | last=Lohr | date=April 22, 2004 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2004, ''The New York Times'' reported that BayStar Capital, a private [[hedge fund]] which had arranged for $50M in funding for SCO in October 2003, was asking for its $20M back. The remainder of the $50M was from Royal Bank of Canada. SCO stated in their press release that they believed that BayStar did not have grounds for making this demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/22/business/technology-investor-s-pullout-stirs-doubts-about-sco-group.html?scp=5&amp;sq=baystar+capital&amp;st=cse|title=TECHNOLOGY; Investor's Pullout Stirs Doubts About SCO Group|first=Steve|last=Lohr|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, 2004, SCO and BayStar resolved their dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/08/27/sco_completes_baystar_settlement/|title=SCO closes BayStar deal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SCO and Canopy Group===
The [[Canopy Group]] is an investment group with shares in a trust of different companies. It is a group owned by the [[Raymond Noorda|Noorda]] family, also founders of Novell.

Until February 2005, Canopy held SCO shares, and the management of SCO held shares of Canopy. The two parties became embroiled in a bitter dispute when the Noorda family sought to oust board member [[Ralph Yarro III]] on claims of [[misappropriation]]. With internal problems not made public (which included the suicides of Canopy's director of [[information systems]], [[Robert Penrose]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051228235018/http://blog.mecworks.com/articles/2004/12/26/rob-penrose/] Rob Penrose&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Val Kriedel]], the daughter of [[Ray Noorda]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/536/000108212/] Noorda bio&lt;/ref&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/125977/|title=Daily Herald - Canopy founder's daughter found dead&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,600111043,00.html] Canopy at Heart of Feud&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smallworks.com/archives/00000250.htm] Sex, Drugs, and Unix {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314051749/http://www.smallworks.com/archives/00000250.htm |date=March 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Canopy Group agreed to buy back all the shares that SCO had in Canopy in exchange for their SCO shares and cash.

SCO and Canopy Group are now mostly independent, though SCO continues to rent their Utah office space from Canopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20071219004012610|title=SCO Asks Bankruptcy Court to Approve New Leases in NJ and Utah|last=Jones|first=Pamela|publisher=Groklaw|date=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microsoft funding of SCO controversy===
On March 4, 2004, a leaked SCO internal e-mail detailed how Microsoft had raised up to $106 million via the BayStar referral and other means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/halloween/halloween10.html|title=Halloween Document 10|website=www.catb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blake Stowell of SCO confirmed the memo was real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1542915,00.asp|title=HP TouchPad Needs 6 to 8 Weeks for Additional Shipments|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; BayStar claimed the deal was suggested by Microsoft, but that no money for it came directly from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2004/tc20040311_8915_tc119.htm|title=BW Online - March 11, 2004 - SCO's Suit: A Match Made in Redmond?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to the Baystar involvement, Microsoft paid SCO $6M (USD) in May 2003 for a license to "Unix and Unix-related patents", despite the lack of Unix-related patents owned by SCO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/08/08/31OPcringely_1.html SCO strikes gold, Verizon just strikes | InfoWorld | Column | 2003-08-08 | By Robert X.

This deal was widely seen in the press as a boost to SCO's finances which would help SCO with its lawsuit against IBM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1016-1007528.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120711233345/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1016-1007528.html|deadurl=yes|title=Microsoft to license Unix code - CNET News|date=11 July 2012|archivedate=11 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ir.sco.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?releaseid=109360 The SCO Group | Investor Relations | SCO Announces UNIX Licensing Deal With Microsoft&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825130902/http://ir.sco.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?releaseid=109360 |date=2006-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SCOsource===
After their initial claim of copyright infringement in the Linux kernel, The SCO Group started their SCOsource initiative, which sells licenses of SCO's claimed copyrighted software, other than OpenServer and Unixware licenses. After a small number of high-profile sales (including one that was denied by the claimed purchaser), SCO claimed to offer corporate users of Linux a license at US$699 per processor running Linux. However, many individuals{{Who|date=December 2015}} have found it impossible to buy such a license from SCO. SCO says that participants of the SCOsource initiative are not liable for any claims that SCO makes against Linux users.

===The Michael Davidson E-Mail===
On July 14, 2005, an email&lt;ref name=md&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/IBM-459-22.pdf |title=Data |website=www.groklaw.net |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; was unsealed that had been sent from Michael Davidson to Reg Broughton (both Caldera International employees) in 2002, before many of the lawsuits. In it, Davidson reported how the company had hired an outside consultant because ''(spelling as in the original)'':
{{cquote|of SCO's executive management refusing to believe that it was possible for Linux and much of the GNU software to have come into existence without *someone* *somewhere* having copied pieces of proprietary UNIX source code to which SCO owned the copyright. The hope was that we would find a "smoking gun" somewhere in code that was being used by Red Hat and/or the other Linux companies that would give us some leverage. (There was, at one stage, the idea that we would sell licences to corporate customers who were using Linux as a kind of "insurance policy" in case it turned out that they were using code which infringed on our copyright).}}

The consultant was to review the Linux code and compare it to Unix source code, to find possible copyright infringement. Davidson himself said that he had not expected to find anything significant based on his own knowledge of the code and had voiced his opinion that it was "a waste of time".

==Plot==
Balakrishna ([[Kamal Haasan]]) is an economically disadvantaged but multi-talented dancer, adept at the Indian classical dances of [[Kuchipudi]], [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Kathak]], etc. Fondly called Balu, his simple and very honest soul does not permit him to attain professional success in the commercial world that requires a certain level of moral laxness. Madhavi ([[Jaya Prada]]), a wealthy young woman and a dance patron, notices his talent and acts as his benefactress, helping him secure an opportunity to participate in a high-level classical dance festival.

Balu's aging mother passes away from the afflictions of poverty two days before the performance. Balu, who was very attached to her, is emotionally devastated and fails to participate in the dance festival. Madhavi nevertheless, gives him support and encouragement and sets him on the mend. Balu gradually develops a fondness for Madhavi as their relationship grows. He hides his love for her, but eventually picks up the courage to express it. Balu discovers that, while Madhavi shares his feelings, she is a married woman separated from her husband. The husband later returns to unite Madhavi and Balu, but Balu decides to sacrifice his love showing respect for the institution of marriage.

The years pass, and Balu, a disappointed man, has become an inconsolable alcoholic and a newspaper journalist/art critic. Meanwhile, Madhavi's husband dies, and she hears about Balu's condition. In a bid to revive his will to live and his passion for his art, she tends to his medical needs through his friend Raghu ([[Sarath Babu]]) and solicits Balu to be the dance master for her daughter, Sailaja ([[SP Sailaja]]).

The film ends with Sailaja's stage performance with Balu watching her in a wheelchair, his health having completely deteriorated dies. Raghu is seen taking him away quietly, without interrupting the performance. Madhavi follows him with an umbrella covering Balu from the rain.

==Production==
Kamal and [[R. C. Sakthi]] wanted to make a film on a subject, about a dancer who was an alcoholic, which they named "Anupallavi", when K. Viswanath approached him with a similar subject, Kamal felt he had to do the film. On the sets of the film, Gopi Krishna, one of the choreographers, insisted that Kamal should train for at least a month. Kamal was one of the top stars of the time, doing multiple shifts, and had to find the time. Kamal said it was the "greatest sacrifice from my side".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/enriching-cinema-kamal-style/article6506926.ece|title=Enriching cinema, Kamal style|author=BARADWAJ RANGAN|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playback singer S. P. Sailaja was recruited to play a prominent role, thereby making her debut as an actress and it also remains her only film she had acted in so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/from-busy-schedule-to-worklife-balance/article6610491.ece|title=From busy schedule to work-life balance|author=Rani Devalla|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; K. Viswanath who is related to Sailaja, decided that she would fit perfectly in the role of Kamal Haasan's pupil, after seeing the photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/on-a-high-note/article486039.ece|title=On a high note|author=OLYMPIA SHILPA GERALD|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sailaja recalled: "I was reluctant as I was trained only in Bharatanatyam, but in the film I had to perform other dance forms like Kathak too. While shooting my introductory song "Om Namah Shivaya" at Ravindra Bharathi, I became nervous on the stage and refused to act".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/melody-unwind/article1430522.ece|title=Melody unwind|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chakri Toleti]] did the role of a photographer boy in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idlebrain.com/celeb/interview/chakritoleti.html|title=Chakri Toleti interview  - Telugu Cinema interview - Telugu film director|work=idlebrain.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-wednesday-is-eenadu-in-telugu/article216212.ece|title=‘A Wednesday’ is ‘Eenadu’ in Telugu|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thotta Tharani said that the budget was drastically cut for the song in which Kamal dances on the well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2005/04/05/stories/2005040500230100.htm|title=The Hindu : Metro Plus Chennai : To the director above, thanks!|work=thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sampul tapestry''' is an ancient woolen wall-hanging found at the [[Tarim Basin]] settlement of  Shanpula ({{zh|山普拉}}) also known as Sampul, in [[Lop County]], [[Xinjiang]], China,&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2002, p. 37, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; close to ancient city of [[Khotan]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopoulos, Lucas (August 2012), "Hellenes and Romans in Ancient China (240 BC – 1398 AD)," in Victor H. Mair (ed), ''Sino-Platonic Papers'', No. 230, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, University of Pennsylvania Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, p. 15, ISSN 2157-9687.&lt;/ref&gt; The object has many [[Hellenistic period]] features, including a [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[centaur]] and [[diadem]], linking it to the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] (formed after the conquest of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] by [[Alexander the Great]] of [[Macedon]] and establishment of the [[Seleucid Empire]]).

==Description==

The full tapestry is 48&amp;nbsp;cm wide and 230&amp;nbsp;cm long.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 2012, p. 285, fn. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The centaur fragment is 45&amp;nbsp;cm by 55&amp;nbsp;cm, warrior's face fragment is 48&amp;nbsp;cm by 52&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="Zhao 2004, p. 194"&gt;Zhao 2004, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; The recovered tapestry only constitutes the left decorative border of what would be a much bigger wall hanging.&lt;ref name="Zhao 2004, p. 194"/&gt;

Made of wool,&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2002, p. 37; Zhao 2004, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; it comprises 24 threads of various colours.

The [[tapestry]] depicts a man with [[Caucasoid]] features,&lt;ref&gt;Time Life 1993, p. 81; Wood 2002, p. 37; Hansen 2012, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; including blue eyes,&lt;ref name="Time Life 1993, p. 81"&gt;Time Life 1993, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[centaur]].&lt;ref&gt;Time Life 1993, p. 81; Wood 2002, p. 37; Hansen 2012, pl. 13 image + text, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; If lost fabric is accounted for, the soldier would be about six times as tall as the centaur.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao 2004, p.195&lt;/ref&gt; The subject is identified as a warrior by the spear he is holding in his hand as well as a dagger tucked on his waist.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao 2004, p. 194; Hansen 2012, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; He wears a tunic with rosette motifs. His headband could be a [[diadem]], a symbol of kingship in the Hellenistic world – and represented on [[Macedon]]ian and other [[ancient Greek coinage]].

The centaur is playing a horn while wearing a cape and a hood.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 2012, pl. 13 text; Zhao 2004, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Surrounding him is a diamond-shaped floral ornament.&lt;ref name="Zhao 2004, p. 194"/&gt;

Due to heavy [[looting]] at the location, the dating of the material is uncertain. It has been assigned dates from the 3rd century BC to the 4th century AD.&lt;ref name="Zhao 2004, p. 194"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time Life 1993, p. 81"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen 2012, pl. 13 text"&gt;Hansen 2012, pl. 13 text&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penn.museum/silkroad/gallery.php Image gallery] for the ''Secrets of the Silk Road'' exhibition at the [[Penn Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood 2002, p. 255"&gt;Wood 2002, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The tapestry was excavated in 1983–1984 at an ancient burial ground in Sampul (Shanpula), 30&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Hotan]] (Khotan), in the [[Tarim Basin]].&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2002, p. 37, p. 255; Zhao 2004, p. 194; Hansen 2012, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

The tapestry was, curiously, fashioned into a pair of man's trousers (all the other trousers found in Sampul had no decoration).&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 2012, pl. 13 text, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
It is uncertain where the tapestry was made, although the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] in Central Asia has been suggested to be a possibility.  The technique used for the tapestry, with more than 24 threads of different colours, is a typically western one.  The centaur's cape and hood are a central Asian modification of the Greek motif.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao 2004, p. 194; Hansen 2012, pl. 13 text&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that he plays a horn also distinguishes him from the Greek prototypes.&lt;ref name="Zhao 2004, p. 194"/&gt;  Flower diamond motif on the warrior's [[lapel]] are of central Asian origin.&lt;ref name="Hansen 2012, pl. 13 text"/&gt;  Certain motifs, particularly the animal head on the soldier's dagger, suggest that the tapestry originated in the kingdom of [[Parthia]] in northern Iran.&lt;ref name="Hansen 2012, p. 202"&gt;Hansen 2012, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Rome|Rome]] has also been proposed as a possible source.&lt;ref name="Hansen 2012, p. 202"/&gt;  Another suggestion is that it is locally made as Tang annal ''[[New Book of Tang]]'' mentioned that local people of Khotan were good at textile and tapestry work when [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141-87 BC) opened the Silk Road to Khotan during the first century BC. The tapestry may have been made roughly a century before the [[Han Chinese]] [[Protectorate of the Western Regions|conquest]] of the [[Tarim Basin]] under Wudi.&lt;ref name="christopoulos"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Christopoulos |last=Lucas |date=August 2012 |title=Hellenes and Romans in Ancient China (240 BC – 1398 AD) |journal=Sino-Platonic Papers |issue=230 |pages=9–20 |issn=2157-9687 |url=http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp230_hellenes_romans_in_china.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hellenistic tapestries have also been found in [[Loulan Kingdom|Loulan]] by [[Aurel Stein]], indicating a cultural link between Loulan and Khotan.&lt;ref name="christopoulos"/&gt;

==Significance==
The existence of this tapestry tends to suggest that contacts  between the Hellenistic kingdoms of Central Asia and the [[Tarim Basin]], at the edge of the Chinese world occurred from around the 3rd century BC.

==Exhibition history==
The tapestry is on permanent display in the Xinjiang Museum, [[Ürümqi]], [[China]].&lt;ref name="Wood 2002, p. 255"/&gt;

Centaur and head fragments of the tapestry have been a part of a major exhibition ''China: Dawn of a Golden Age, 200–750 AD'', held at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City|New York]], from 12 October 2004 to 23 January 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2004/china-dawn-of-a-golden-age-200750-ad China: Dawn of a Golden Age, 200–750 AD]'' at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 18 February to 5 June 2011, they were displayed at the [[Penn Museum]], [[Philadelphia]], in exhibition ''Secrets of the Silk Road''.&lt;ref&gt;Sheng 2010, p. 33, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.penn.museum/past-exhibits/188-secrets-of-the-silk-road.html Secrets of the Silk Road]'' at the [[Penn Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1790">The '''''Symphony in E-Flat Major, Op. 11, No. 3''''' is a late symphony by [[Johann Stamitz]] likely written in [[Paris]], [[France]] in 1754 or 1755.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notes to Johann Stamitz Symphonies Vol. 1 on Naxos|url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.553194&amp;catNum=553194&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English#|accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of his last symphonies and is in the standard 4-movement symphonic scheme of the time:
#Allegro Assai
#Andantino
#Menuetto
#Prestissimo

This symphony, like many others by Stamitz, influenced [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Mozart]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}  It is approximately fifteen minutes in length, and demonstrates Stamitz's late symphonic style. It demonstrates the culmination of the Mannheim school of orchestral playing which emphasized extended techniques for the instruments (musicians at this time were mostly people with free time and simply played when asked), among them an attention to detail of dynamics. The concept of "Sturm und Drang", German for approximately storminess, or a very angular sharp contrast musically can be seen in this work with very sudden dynamic changes and a sharp texture change, presented when the oboes enter with the Beta Theme, or "B" theme. This work is significant in that it is one of the earlier symphonic works and begins to establish the genre of the Symphony, which would then be expanded upon by Mozart and most notably Hadyn, who is the "Father of the Symphony"

A '''teddy bear''' is a [[stuffed toy|soft toy]] in the form of a [[bear]]. Developed apparently simultaneously by toymakers [[Morris Michtom]] in the U.S. and [[Richard Steiff]] in Germany in the early years of the 20th century, and named after President [[Theodore Roosevelt|Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt]], the teddy bear became an iconic children's toy, celebrated in story, song, and film.&lt;ref name=APOV&gt;[[David Cannadine]], ''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21265701  A point of view - The Grownups with teddy bears]'', 1 February 2013, (accessed 2013-02-01)&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the creation of the first teddy bears which sought to imitate the form of real bear cubs, "teddies" have greatly varied in form, style, color, and material.  They have become [[collectable|collector's items]], with older and rarer "teddies" appearing at public auctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?from=salesummary&amp;intObjectID=5359783 | title = A STEIFF HARLEQUIN TEDDY BEAR, jointed, half red and half blue mohair, one blue and black and one brown and black glass eye, black stitching, yellow felt pads and FF button, circa 1925 --13½in.

==History&lt;span id="Teddy bear (cartoon)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;==
[[File:TheodoreRooseveltTeddyBear.jpg|thumb|A 1902 political cartoon in ''[[The Washington Post]]''  spawned the ''teddy bear'' name.]]

The name ''teddy bear'' comes from former [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who was commonly known as "Teddy" (though he loathed being referred to as such).&lt;ref name=HandyBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Matuz|first=Roger|title=The Handy Presidents Answer Book|year=2004|publisher=Visible Ink Press|location=Canton, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name originated from an incident on a bear hunting trip in [[Mississippi]] in November 1902, to which Roosevelt was invited by Mississippi Governor [[Andrew H. Longino]]. There were several other hunters competing, and most of them had already killed an animal.  A suite of Roosevelt's attendants, led by [[Holt Collier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.fws.gov/refuges/HoltCollier_history.pdf |title=Holt Collier |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; cornered, clubbed, and tied an [[American black bear]] to a willow tree after a long exhausting chase with [[hound]]s.  They called Roosevelt to the site and suggested that he should shoot it.  He refused to shoot the bear himself, deeming this unsportsmanlike, but instructed that the bear be killed to put it out of its misery,&lt;ref&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/od/tstartinventions/a/Teddy_Bear.htm "History of the Teddy Bear"]. Retrieved March 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/aa/roosevelt/aa_roosevelt_bears_1.html| title=Teddy Bears| publisher=Library Of Congress| accessdate=2007-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it became the topic of a [[Editorial cartoon|political cartoon]] by [[Clifford K. Berryman|Clifford Berryman]] in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' on November 16, 1902.&lt;ref name="Clay"&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.teddybearandfriends.com/archive/articles/history.html| title=The History of the Teddy Bear| first = Marianne | last = Clay | year = 2002 | work = Teddy Bear &amp; Friends | publisher = Madavor Media, LLC | accessdate=2007-12-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723184018/http://www.teddybearandfriends.com/archive/articles/history.html |archivedate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the initial cartoon of an adult [[American black bear|black bear]] lassoed by a handler and a disgusted Roosevelt had symbolic overtones, later issues of that and other Berryman cartoons made the bear smaller and cuter.&lt;ref name="theodoreroosevelt.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/life/tr_teddy.htm|title=Theodore Roosevelt Association.

[[Morris Michtom]] saw the drawing of Roosevelt and was inspired to create a teddy bear. He created a tiny soft bear cub and put it in the shop window with a sign "Teddy's bear," after sending a bear to Roosevelt and receiving permission to use his name.  The toys were an immediate success and Michtom founded the [[Ideal Toy Company|Ideal Novelty and Toy Co]].&lt;ref name="LoC"/&gt;

At the same time in Germany, the [[Margarete Steiff GmbH|Steiff firm]], unaware of Michtom's bear, produced a stuffed bear from [[Richard Steiff]]'s designs. Steiff exhibited the toy at the Leipzig Toy Fair in March 1903, where it was seen by Hermann Berg, a buyer for George Borgfeldt &amp; Company in New York (and the brother of composer [[Alban Berg]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therestisnoise.com/2010/07/berg-festival.html|title=Bring on the Berg|website=Alex Ross: The Rest Is Noise}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ordered 3,000 to be sent to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/2537943.stm Teddy bear celebrates 100th birthday] BBC, 2002-12-03&lt;/ref&gt; Although Steiff's records show that the bears were produced, they are not recorded as arriving in the U.S., and no example of the type, "55 PB", has ever been seen, leading to the story that the bears were [[shipwreck]]ed. However, the story is disputed - Gunther Pfieffer notes that it was only recorded in 1953 and says it is more likely that the 55 PB was not sufficiently durable to survive until the present day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14231337 The great teddy bear shipwreck mystery], BBC News, Francis Cronin, 26 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Although Steiff and Michtom were both making teddy bears at around the same time, neither would have known of the other's creation due to poor [[Atlantic Ocean|transatlantic]] communication.&lt;ref name="Clay" /&gt;

North American educator [[Seymour Eaton]] wrote the children's book series ''The Roosevelt Bears'',&lt;ref name="GLCA"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lansdownecivic.com/Pages/hometown_stories/13_eaton.html| title=Seymour Eaton| publisher=Greater Lansdowne Civic Association (GLCA)| year=2003| accessdate=2007-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; while composer [[John Walter Bratton]] wrote an instrumental "[[Teddy bears' picnic|The Teddy Bears' Picnic]]", a "characteristic two-step", in 1907, which later had words written to it by lyricist [[Jimmy Kennedy]] in 1932.

Early teddy bears were made to look like real bears, with extended snouts and beady eyes.  Modern teddy bears tend to have larger eyes and foreheads and smaller noses, [[Infant|babylike]] features that enhance the [[toy]]'s [[cuteness]].  Teddy bears are also manufactured to represent different species of bear, such as [[polar bear]]s and [[grizzly bear]]s, as well as [[giant panda|pandas]].

While early teddy bears were covered in tawny [[mohair]] fur, modern teddy bears are manufactured in a wide variety of commercially available [[fabric]]s, most commonly [[fake fur|synthetic fur]], but also [[velour]], [[denim]], [[cotton]], [[satin]], and [[canvas]].

==Production==

===Commercial===
Commercially made, mass-produced teddy bears are predominantly made as toys for children. These bears either have safety joints for attaching arms, legs, and heads, or else the joints are sewn and not articulated. They must have securely fastened eyes that do not pose a choking hazard for small children. These "plush" bears must meet a rigid standard of construction in order to be marketed to children in the United States and in the European Union.

There are also companies, like Steiff, that sell handmade collectible bears that can be purchased in stores or over the Internet.
The majority of teddy bears are manufactured in countries such as China and Indonesia. A few small, single-person producers in the United States make unique, non-mass-produced teddy bears. In the [[United Kingdom]] one small, traditional teddy bear company remains, [[Merrythought]], which was established in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12523562 BBC News] Britain's last surviving teddy bear factory&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Mohair]], the fur shorn or combed from a breed of long haired goats, is woven into cloth, dyed and trimmed. [[Alpaca]] teddy bears are made from the pelt of an alpaca because the fiber is too soft to weave. In addition to mohair and alpaca, there is a huge selection of "plush" or synthetic fur made for the teddy bear market. Both these types of fur are commercially produced.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Amateur===
Teddy bears are a favourite form of soft toy for amateur toy makers, with many patterns commercially produced or available online. Many "teddies" are home-made as gifts or for charity, while "teddy bear artists" often create "teddies" for retail, decorating them individually with commercial and recycled ornaments such as sequins, beads and ribbons .  Sewn teddy bears are made from a wide range of materials including [[felt]], [[cotton]] and [[velour]]. While many are stitched, others are made from [[yarn]], either [[Knitting|knitted]] or [[crochet]]ed. Teddy bears are also made of plywood and a range of other craft materials.

===Antiques===
Michtom's jointed [[mohair]] "Teddy's bear" was very popular when first designed and remains so with collectors today. Fake bears look suspiciously new and unhandled: their noses are unworn, and their seams may be thick and uneven. All Ideal bears have jointed hips, necks, and shoulders. Early examples have a characteristic "American football" shape and are mostly made of short gold or beige mohair plush with matching felt paws, and distinctive, sharply pointed foot pads. They have shoe-button or glass eyes, and the fur around the muzzle may be shorn. Later bears were made in a large variety of colours and types—for example, pandas—and had longer fur.

Other collectible bears include ones by the Knickerbocker Toy Co. (active 1924–1925) in New York, which are clearly marked with a label in the front seam. Similar to many early American bears, Knickerbocker bears usually have long bodies, small feet, and short, straight arms and legs. Their later bears can be recognized by their large inverted ears and big noses. Other collectible bears include Gund Manufacturing Co. (est. 1898), now in New York, and "Hershey's bears", which were designed to promote [[The Hershey Company]]'s chocolate bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beazley|first=Mitchell|title=Teddy Bears|url=http://0-www.credoreference.com.helin.uri.edu/entry/mae/teddy_bears|work=Miller's Antiques Encyclopedia|publisher=Credo Reference|accessdate=2013-02-25}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retail sales of stuffed plush animals including teddy bears totaled $1.3 billion in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.corporate-ir.net/library/18/182/182478/items/286985/2007_AR_FINAL.pdf |title=Build-A-Bear Workshop Inc. |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly sold brands include [[Gund]] and [[Ty Inc.]] Brands associated with teddy bears that enjoyed strong popularity in the 1980s and 1990s are [[Teddy Ruxpin]] and [[Care Bears]]. Various TV shows and movies have a teddy bear depicted, such as ''[[Super Ted]]'' and ''[[Mr. Bean]]''.

Teddy bears have seen a resurgence in popularity as international "do-it-yourself" chains have opened. Among the largest and best-known are [[Build-A-Bear Workshop]] and [[Vermont Teddy Bear Company]].

Some popular mass-marketed teddy bears made today include [[Rupert Bear|Rupert]], [[Sooty]], [[Paddington Bear|Paddington]], and [[Children in Need#History|Pudsey Bear]]. Books have also been written with the teddy bear featured as their main character. These include [[Winnie-the-Pooh]], [[Corduroy (book)|Corduroy]], Teddy Tells Time, Tristan the Teddy Bear (from the Teddy Bear Tales) and [[Teddy Dressing]].

==="The Teddy Bears' Picnic"===
The popularity of the toy inspired [[John Walter Bratton]] to compose the melody "[[Teddy Bears' Picnic|The Teddy Bears' Picnic]]" (1907).  The lyrics were added in 1932 by [[Jimmy Kennedy]].

===Teddy bear museums===
The world's first [[teddy bear museum]] was set up in [[Petersfield, Hampshire]], England, in 1984. In 1990, [[Teddy Bear Museum of Naples|a similar foundation]] was set up in [[Naples, Florida|Naples]], [[Florida]], United States. These were closed in 2006 and 2005 respectively, and the bears were sold in auctions, but there are many teddy bear museums around the world today.

===Teddy Bear Cops program===
Because police, fire and emergency officials found that giving a teddy bear to a child during a crisis stabilized and calmed them, [[NAPLC]] created the Teddy Bear Cops program to distribute teddy bears to police, fire, and emergency officials throughout the United States, for their use in providing teddy bears to children in emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teddybearcop.com/ |title=Officers using the Teddy Bear Cops program |publisher=Teddybearcop.com |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Beguiling of Merlin''''' is a painting by the British [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painter [[Edward Burne-Jones]] that was created between 1872 and 1877.

The painting depicts a scene from the [[Arthurian legend]] about the infatuation of [[Merlin]] with the [[Lady of the Lake]], [[Nimue]]. Merlin is shown trapped, helpless in a [[Common Hawthorn|hawthorn bush]] as Nimue reads from a book of spells.&lt;ref name="lever"/&gt;

The work was commissioned from Burne-Jones by [[Frederick Richards Leyland]], a [[Liverpool]] ship-owner and art-collector,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/biog/Leyl_FR.htm Frederick Richards Leyland, 1832-1892] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103144737/http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/biog/Leyl_FR.htm |date=2007-11-03 }} at the Center for Whistler Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1860s. After a false start blamed on "poor materials", Burne-Jones began work on the painting proper in 1873, finishing the body of the work by the end of 1874; however, the painting was not first exhibited until 1877 at the opening exhibition of the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] in London.&lt;ref name="lever"/&gt;

Burne-Jones used [[Maria Zambaco]], who was probably his mistress from 1866 to 1872, for the model for the head of Nimue.&lt;ref name="lever"/&gt;

''The Beguiling of Merlin'' was purchased by [[Lord Leverhulme]] in 1918 and remains in the [[Lady Lever Art Gallery]] to the present day.&lt;ref name="lever"&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/picture-of-month/displaypicture.asp?venue=7&amp;id=105 Artwork of the Month - January 2003 - ''The Beguiling of Merlin'', by Edward Coley Burne-Jones (1833 – 1898)] at Liverpoolmuseums.org.uk.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting features on the covers of the books ''[[Possession: A Romance]]'' (1990), by [[A. S. Byatt]], and [[Fiona MacCarthy]]'s biography of Burne-Jones, ''[[The Last Pre-Raphaelite]]'' (2011).&lt;ref name="MacCarthy"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/aug/25/last-pre-raphaelite-maccarthy-review | title=The Last Pre-Raphaelite by Fiona MacCarthy |first=Rosemary| last=Hill| newspaper=The Guardian | date=25 August 2011 | accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting also plays a significant role in the 1991 novel ''[[King Solomon's Carpet]]'' by [[Ruth Rendell]] writing as [[Barbara Vine]].

'''''The Dance of Death &amp; Other Plantation Favorites''''' (originally issued as '''''Vol. 3: The Dance of Death &amp; Other Plantation Favorites''''') is the third [[album]] by [[United States|American]] [[fingerstyle guitar]]ist and composer [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]], released in 1965. The 1999 reissue contained four previously unreleased tracks.

== History ==
In the early ’60s, Fahey was enrolled in the graduate program in folklore studies at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. In the summer of 1964, along with [[Bill Barth]] and [[Henry Vestine]], Fahey visited the South where they “rediscovered” blues great [[Skip James]].&lt;ref name = "Wire"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Pouncey | first = Edwin | authorlink =  | title = Blood on the Frets | journal = [[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]] | volume = | issue = 174| pages = | publisher = | location = | date = August 1998| url = http://www.johnfahey.com/Blood.htm | issn = | doi = | id = | accessdate = March 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fahey and [[ED Denson]] formally created Takoma Records in 1963. With increased distribution, Fahey's albums began to enjoy increased sales and popularity, though he had not as yet publicly performed on stage. As Matt Hanks stated in his article "Age Against the Machine" for ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]'', "For some reason, the [[hippie]]s loved it."&lt;ref name="WCP"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Dunlap Jr.| first = David| title = The Cosmos Club| journal = Washington City Paper| pages = | publisher = | date = July 7, 2006| url = http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/cover/2006/cover0707.html?navEdit| accessdate = March 10, 2010| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080627200714/http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/cover/2006/cover0707.html?navEdit| archivedate = June 27, 2008| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ND"&gt;{{cite journal| last =Hanks| first =Matt| title =Age Against the Machine| journal =[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]| volume =| issue =May–June| pages =| publisher =| location =| year =1997| url =http://archives.nodepression.com/1997/05/age-against-the-machine/| issn =| doi =| id =| accessdate =March 17, 2010| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120928155842/http://archives.nodepression.com/1997/05/age-against-the-machine/| archivedate =September 28, 2012| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his part, Fahey stated in his liner notes for his 1996 release ''[[City of Refuge (John Fahey album)|City of Refuge]]'', "I do hope that nobody will try to make me out as a child of the sixties. I was playing what I play before and after the sixties. This period had very little influence on me. I was never a hippie, and had no hippie friends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= John |last= Fahey |title= Liner Notes: ''City of Refuge'' |url= http://www.johnfahey.com/pages/crnotes.html |publisher=  |accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album was recorded at Adelphi Studios by Gene Rosenthal. Rosenthal would later create [[Adelphi Records]], naming his label after Fahey's song "The Downfall of the Adelphi Rolling Grist Mill". He also claimed three other unused tracks from these sessions were used on subsequent releases by Fahey.&lt;ref name = "WCP" /&gt; Over 30 songs were recorded during the three-day sessions.&lt;ref name="LN"&gt;{{cite web |first= Lee|last= Gardner |title= ''Liner notes from 1999 reissue'' |url=  |publisher=  |accessdate=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the sessions, Fahey recalled, ""It was an interesting session. It was the only one I ever did on marijuana and whiskey. It was kind of bouncy, you know. Another reason for that—I didn't actually own a good guitar at that time, so I was using Bill Barth's guitar, which was a big J-something Gibson and it had a real high action, so I couldn't hold the strings down very well."&lt;ref name="LN" /&gt;

"The Last Steam Engine Train" was [[Cover version|covered]] by [[Leo Kottke]] on his 1969 album ''[[12-String Blues]]'' and again on his 1973 album ''[[Greenhouse (Leo Kottke album)|Greenhouse]]''. 

"On the Banks of the Owchita" is a duet with guitarist [[Bill Barth]]. The 1999 reissue bonus track "[[Steel Guitar Rag]]" is based on "Guitar Rag",  [[Sylvester Weaver (musician)|Sylvester Weaver]]'s original version of the song. "Wine and Roses" was later re-titled as "The Red Pony". "Poor Boy" became a Fahey standard.&lt;ref name="LN" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnfahey.com/pages/v32.html Song notes at The Fahey Files]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fahey continued writing liner notes in a similar vein as his previous two releases, attributing them to "Elijah P. Lovejoy". The notes were extensive, pseudo-academic, and humorous — all included in a booklet, which would often be the case on early releases by Fahey. Andy Beta, of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' described Fahey's liner notes in a 2006 article: "Doctoring loquacious, ludicrous liner notes for his self-released work that tempered his arrogant self-mythologizing with hilarious self-effacement, he mocked the academic bluster of scholars and revivalists. He renames his Fonotone patron "Joseph Buzzard," records as Blind Joe Death, or else espouses his work as "expert" Elijah P. Lovejoy." and  noise guitarist and writer Alan Licht noted that Fahey "did as much to take folk out of the hands of squares as his music did," and he suffered lightly those that pined for the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beta |first=Andy |title= ''Looking for Blind Joe Death'' |journal=[[The Village Voice]]|issue= |date=January 2006 |url = http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-01-24/music/looking-for-blind-joe-death/|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notes on ''The Dance of Death'' included an extensive discography and the  basic theme of the notes is the search for John Fahey and his musical legacy:

:"Prior to his discovery in 1958 by a Takoma research team Fahey had played as a guitarist for a bluegrass band; often appearing with Bill Hancock and Greg Eldridge, but no recordings are known from this period. Sometime in 1956 he was smote to the ground by a bolt of lightning. Upon awakening he heard Blind Willie Johnson singing and from that time onward he ceased playing hillbilly and concentrated upon blues. His first recordings were made under somewhat mysterious circumstances for the Fonotone company—a pioneer in the folkfield.

:Shortly before she met her tragic end by impalement when a chair rung she was tuning slipped from place under terrific pressure, Mrs Petranick informed us that John had the knowledge to operate recording equipment and that he was a hypnotist. Evidently, he would go to Fonotone with Blind Joe Death and Blind Thomas. The next morning the A &amp; R man would awaken with a slight headache and a stack of unidentified masters. Needless to say this has left some ambiguity in the records of the company. We have here listed all recordings made by any of these artists, regardless of the name used on the label. While doubtless some of them are by Death or Thomas or even Firk, all of them are of considerable merit and we felt it best to take the risk of including a few too many, rather than risk leaving any out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Fahey |title= ''Original liner notes: The Dance of Death &amp; Other Plantation Favorites''  |url= http://www.johnfahey.com/pages/v3note.html |publisher=Takoma Records |accessdate=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the liner notes for the 1999 reissue, Lee Gardner comments "[It] represents the first, best recorded declaration from Fahey that he was interested in transforming his music into a vehicle for personal expression that built on his influences but accepted none of their prosaic boundaries. Nowadays this sort of concept is a given. But it didn't exist until Fahey took it on, and precious few of those who have followed him took it farther than he did."&lt;ref name="LN" /&gt;

In reviewing ''The Dance of Death &amp; Other Plantation Favorites'' for [[Allmusic]], music critic [[Richie Unterberger]] called it "One of Fahey's less eccentric early efforts, featuring relatively straightforward instrumentals showcasing his deft finger work and occasional keening slide."&lt;ref name="AM" /&gt;

In his review of the 1999 reissue, Alex Henderson called the CD "...essentially a folk album, but a folk album with strong country and blues leanings... this album makes it clear that even back in 1964 Fahey was quite original."&lt;ref name="AM2" /&gt;

Music critic Ivan Emke referred to the original album as "the one that helped to launch his reputation. Much of it is inspired by the country blues and Delta sounds that he had been drawn to, and yet it was obvious that Fahey [was] taking the tunes to places they hadn't been before... a classic; it provides a snapshot of a musician in transition."&lt;ref name="DL" /&gt;

'''''The Entry''''' is a 1789 cartoon that depicted [[George Washington]] riding a donkey into New York.  It was first distributed during the time of Washington's inauguration as the first president of the United States.  Many accounts say it was "hawked on the streets of the capitol".  No copies of this work have been found since at least 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Birth of the Nation: The First Federal Congress, 1789-1791 | author = Charlene Bangs Bickford, Kenneth R.

== Background ==
On April 14, 1789 Washington received official notification that he had been unanimously selected by the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]] to be the first president of the United States.  Washington set off from [[Mount Vernon]] to the U.S. capital in New York City on the morning of April 16.  Washington passed through [[Alexandria, Virginia]]; [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown, Maryland]] (in present-day Washington D.C.); [[Baltimore]]; [[Grays Ferry, Philadelphia]]; and [[Trenton, New Jersey]], before arriving in New York on April 23.

The [[first inauguration of George Washington]] took place on April 30, 1789 on the balcony of [[Federal Hall]] in New York City.

== Records of the cartoon ==
On the seventh of April, [[John Armstrong, Sr.]] wrote to [[Horatio Gates]] regarding the lavish preparations in New York City, saying&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The republican court; or, American society in the days of Washington | author = Rufus Wilmot Griswold | authorlink = Rufus Wilmot Griswold | page = 123 | year = 1856 | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moa/AAN8036.0001.001/149?sid=95e3f6e828e116b80d4cccd93c806bc1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The home of Washington; or, Mount Vernon and its associations, historical, biographical, and pictorial | author = Benson J. Lossing | year = 1870 | page = 214 | url = https://archive.org/stream/homeofwashington03loss#page/214/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Yet in the midst of this admiration, there are skeptics who doubt its propriety, and wits who amuse themselves at its extravagance. The first will grumble and the last will laugh, and the President should be prepared to meet the attacks of both with firmness and good nature. A caricature has already appeared called 'The Entry,' full of very disloyal and profane allusions. It represents the General mounted on an ass, and in the arms of his man Billy — Humphreys leading the Jack, and chanting hosannas and birthday odes. The following couplet proceeds from the mouth of the devil:

{{poemquote|The glorious time has come to pass 
When David shall conduct an ass.}} }}

Referring to the same letter, James Parton in ''Caricature and other comic art in all times and many lands'' (1877) refers to the couplet above as "one couplet of which was legible", and remarks that "This effort was more ill-natured than brilliant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/caotherc00part#page/308/mode/2up | title=Caricature and other comic art in all times and many lands | publisher=[[Harper &amp; Brothers]] | author=Parton, James | year=1877 | page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Our Country'', also published in 1877, Benson J. Lossing provided the following graphic description of the known couplet within the cartoon: 

{{quote|The Devil appeared prominent, and from his mouth issued the words&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.publicbookshelf.com/public_html/Our_Country_vol_2/georgewas_bfb.html | title=Our Country: A Household History of the United States | publisher=Johnson &amp; Bailey | author=Lossing, Benson J. | year=1877 | location=New York | authorlink=Benson John Lossing}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 8 March 1896, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = New York Times | date = 8 March 1896 | title = Some Early American Caricatures | page = 32 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/20380104/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It represented the President riding on an ass which his aid, Col. David Humphrey, was leading. Out of the latter's mouth this hosanna was issuing: "The glorious time has come to pass / When David shall conduct an ass".}}

Another record of ''The Entry'' is found in the two-volume work ''A history of American graphic humor, 1747-1938'' (1933), by English-born American art historian [[William Murrell]] and published by the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/murrellw.htm | title = Murrell, William | publisher = Dictionary of Art Historians }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A history of American graphic humor, 1747-1938 | year = 1933 | page = 34 | url = https://archive.org/stream/histamer01murr#page/34/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the index, he records it as "satire, published in 1789"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/homeofwashington03loss#page/444/mode/2up |title=The home of Washington; or, Mount Vernon and its associations, historical, biographical, and pictorial |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provides this description:

{{quote|On this side of the Atlantic we have record, in a letter from an old Tory to a friend, of a cartoon depicting Washington on a throne and George III on bended knees before him. This was about 1778 or 1780. There seems to be no copy of [anywhere] of the one entitled ''The Entry'' representing Washington riding upon an ass, supported by his man-servant, and led by Col. David Humphreys, singing doggerel verses. A fair sample of the derisive nature of the whole may be gathered from the couplet which has been preserved:

{{poemquote|The glorious time has come to pass
When David shall conduct an ass.}} }}

One thesis says that it "appeared in early April 1789, probably over or directly after the Palm Sunday weekend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | title = Mr. President: Washington, the Presidency &amp; the Indispensable Title Controversy of 1789 | author = Mary Kathleen Bartoloni de Tuazon | page = 59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paja Jovanović;Ranjeni Crnogorac .jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[Paja Jovanović]], ''The Wounded Montenegrin'' (''Ranjeni Crnogorac''), {{circa|1882}}, oil on canvas, {{convert|114|x|186|cm}}, [[Matica Srpska]] gallery]]
'''''The Wounded Montenegrin''''' ({{lang-sr|Рањени Црногорац}}, ''Ranjeni Crnogorac'') is the title of four nearly identical compositions by the artist [[Paja Jovanović]] depicting a wounded youth surrounded by peasants in traditional clothing, likely during the [[Montenegrin–Ottoman War (1876–78)|Montenegrin–Ottoman War]] of 1876–78.

The first rendering garnered praise from critics, and won the first-place prize at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna|Academy of Fine Arts]]' annual art exhibition in [[Vienna]] in 1882. Given its success, Jovanović was granted an [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] government scholarship and entered into a contract with the French Gallery in [[London]] to produce a series of paintings on Balkan life.  Art historians consider ''The Wounded Montenegrin'' one of Jovanović's best [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] works. Jovanović went on to complete three further versions of the composition in the ensuing decades, three of which are [[oil painting]]s. The first is currently on display at the [[Matica Srpska]] gallery in [[Novi Sad]], the second and third are in private collections, and the fourth is housed at the [[Museum of Yugoslav History]] in [[Belgrade]].

==Description==
The original [[oil painting]] measures {{convert|114|x|189|cm}}.{{efn|Filipovitch-Robinson gives the dimensions as {{convert|114|x|186|cm}}.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=45}}}} It shows a muscular, wounded youth surrounded by ten peasants in a humble, single-room dwelling.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2008|p=39}} The peasants wear hand-sewn shirts, rough leggings and leather shoes. They stand over a dirt floor, and in the background, a collection of eating utensils hang precariously from a makeshift shelf. The youth is cradled in the arms of a crouching, shaved-headed warrior. The two are surrounded by a pair of heavily armed men on either side of them.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=44}} Nearby, a light-haired girl quietly grieves. To the right of these figures stands a grief-stricken old man, himself surrounded by a number of figures in folk attire.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2008|p=39}} To the far right, two figures can be seen standing inauspiciously in the shadows. The artist's signature, rendered as ''Joanowits P.'', can be found at the bottom right.{{sfn|Petrović|2012|p=16}}

Jovanović composed a total of four versions of ''The Wounded Montenegrin'', three oil paintings and one sketch. What distinguishes the first rendering from subsequent versions is its size (it is the largest by far), detailed precision, and the artist's removal of the two figures seen lingering in the shadows in the original.{{sfn|Petrović|2012|p=16}} The second version, an oil painting, measures {{convert|100|x|152|cm}}. The artist's signature, ''P. Ivanovitch'', can be seen at the bottom right.{{sfn|Petrović|2012|p=44}} The third rendition is a sketch measuring {{convert|23|x|35|cm}}, with the artist's signature, ''Pa. Jo.'', at the bottom right.{{sfn|Petrović|2012|p=41}} The fourth version, another oil painting, measures {{convert|70|x|103|cm}}. The artist's signature, ''Paul Ivanovitch'', can be seen at the bottom right.{{sfn|Petrović|2012|p=44}}

Jovanović did not assign titles to his works, as he felt that if a painting was well composed viewers would be able to deduce the title themselves. Thus, the majority of the artist's works are referred to by a number of different titles.{{sfn|Kusovac|2012|loc=p. 118, note 156}} ''The Wounded Montenegrin'' also appears under the titles ''The Wounded Herzegovinian'' (''Ranjeni Hercegovac''), ''The Wounded Bosnian'' (''Ranjeni Bosanac''), ''Sad Encounter'' (''Žalosni susret''), ''Sad Farewell'' (''Žalosni rastanak'') and ''Unsuccessful Banditry'' (''Neuspelo razbojništvo'').{{sfn|Petrović|2012|p=16}}

==History==
===Background===
[[File:P. Jovanovic.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Paja Jovanović]], {{circa|1899}}]]
[[Paja Jovanović]] (1859–1957) was one of the most prominent Serbian [[Realism (arts)|realist]] painters of the late 19th century.{{sfn|Jelavich|Jelavich|1977|p=280}} During his early career, he came to be identified with [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] painting, depicting scenes from the [[Balkans]], which were then under the control of the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2008|p=39}} Between 1877 and 1882, he attended the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna|Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Vienna]], where he came under the mentorship of painting instructors [[Christian Griepenkerl]] and [[Leopold Müller (painter)|Leopold Müller]]. Griepenkerl taught the young Jovanović the underlying structural principles of [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] art, thus helping him better understand spatial problems and the arrangement of large numbers of figures, both moving and static. Müller encouraged Jovanović to take a [[Realism (arts)|naturalist]] approach to painting, recording only what he could see and relying as little as possible on his imagination. It was in this context that Müller instructed Jovanović to make direct studies of Balkan life during his visits home, purposely steering him towards Orientalist painting.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=43}}

Orientalist works, vignettes of "exotic life" in the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and the Balkans, were quite popular with Central and Western European art collectors in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. At the time of ''The Wounded Montenegrin'''s composition, events in the Balkans had been making headline news in European capitals for decades.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=44}} The Montenegrins had fought and lost the 1861–62 [[Montenegrin–Ottoman War (1861–62)|Montenegrin–Ottoman War]]. This was followed by about a decade of peace, but in 1872, the Ottomans massacred more than 20 Montenegrins. The [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875–77)|Herzegovina Uprising]] of 1875 prompted Montenegro and [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] to declare war on the Ottoman Empire, sparking the [[Great Eastern Crisis]] of 1875–78. The wars ended in the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878, but occasional cross-border skirmishing continued until the early 1880s.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2008|p=39}} Although Jovanović never specified, it is likely the painting is set during the 1876–78 [[Montenegrin–Ottoman War (1876–78)|Montenegrin–Ottoman War]].{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=44}}

===Provenance===
Jovanović composed the first, and most famous, version of ''The Wounded Montenegrin'' in 1882 while studying at the Vienna Academy. It was sold to a merchant named Schwartz in Vienna later that year. Within several months, Schwartz sold the painting to a Budapest casino for 1,000 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|florin]]s. After [[World War II]], it came into the possession of the Yugoslav embassy in Budapest, which gifted it to the [[Matica Srpska]] gallery in 1971, where it is on permanent display. It is catalogued under inventory code ГМС Y/3912.{{sfn|Petrović|2012|p=16}}

The second version of ''The Wounded Montenegrin'' was composed in 1891. It was initially owned by Arthur Toot &amp; Sons, a London art dealer, before coming into the possession of the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]]. Afterwards, it entered into a private collection, and remained in private ownership until 1989, when it was auctioned off at [[Sotheby's]]. Between 1989 and 1997, it was housed at a museum in [[Rome]], but sold again thereafter. It is currently in a private collection.{{sfn|Petrović|2012|p=44}}

The third version, composed after 1900, is part of a private collection.{{sfn|Petrović|2012|p=41}} The fourth, painted in the 1920s, was in a private collection until World War II. After the war, it was confiscated by the [[communism|communists]]. Following the death of Yugoslav leader [[Josip Broz Tito]], it was put on display at Tito's mausoleum, the [[House of Flowers (mausoleum)|House of Flowers]]. It is currently on display at the [[Museum of Yugoslav History]], and catalogued under the inventory code 59 R.{{sfn|Petrović|2012|p=44}}

==Analysis==
In line with Müller's advice, Jovanović avoided creating a sentimental work and focused instead on depicting characters and situations he observed during his time in the Balkans. This differentiates the painting from other Orientalist paintings of the day, which were based on travel accounts rather than first-hand experience.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=44}} The [[History of art|art historian]] Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson notes that the grouping of the figures and their interactions with one another are reminiscent of images of the [[Lamentation of Christ|lamentation]] over the body of Christ.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2008|p=39}} The right half of the scene recedes into shadow while the brightly illuminated left, where the principal figures are located, appears to expand towards the viewer. Jovanović thus directs the viewer's eye from left to right, foreground to background, through the circular pattern of the groupings as well as the diagonal lines of the peasants' swords. In line with Müller's teachings regarding light and colour, Jovanović adds touches of bright red to give warmth and movement to the scene, making it appear as though it is unfolding before the viewer. The brushwork is varied, ranging from the smooth broad strokes that define the solidity of the walls to quick short ones that make it appear like the figures are in motion.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2008|p=40}}

Filipovitch-Robinson praises Jovanović's "skillful handling" of [[linear perspective|linear]] and [[aerial perspective|aerial]] perspective. She notes that the work is devoid of the "studio-contrived quality" of other Orientalist paintings, and argues that Jovanović's main goal was not to depict a particular historical event but rather to remind his audience of the Balkan peoples' ongoing struggle against the Ottoman Turks and provide a human face to those engaged in that struggle.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2008|p=40}}

==Reception and legacy==
The painting was first shown in public in 1882, at the Vienna Academy's annual student exhibition, which exhibited works produced during the 1881–82 academic year.{{sfn|Petrović|2012|p=16}} It was well received by art critics and Jovanović's peers, who judged it to be the exhibition's finest work and bestowed him the first-place prize.{{sfn|Antić|1970|p=30}} Jovanović also received an [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] government scholarship. The exact amount accorded to the artist is disputed. Petar Petrović, the curator of the [[National Museum of Serbia]], writes that the scholarship amounted to 300 florins.{{sfn|Petrović|2012|p=16}} Art historians Radmila Antić{{sfn|Antić|1970|p=31}} and Nikola Kusovac{{sfn|Kusovac|2009|p=35}} state the scholarship amounted to 1,000 florins. Jovanović's triumph at the student exhibition and the subsequent scholarship gave him the means to travel over the summer holidays, during which he came up with a number of ideas for future paintings, such as ''The Fencing Lesson'' (''Mačevanje'').{{sfn|Kusovac|2009|p=35}} Winning the Vienna Academy prize established him as a respected painter of Orientalist works and set the stage for further recognition and success.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=44}} In 1883, Jovanović entered into a contract with [[Ernest Gambart]]'s French Gallery in [[London]] to produce a series of paintings on Balkan life.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=46}} This contract assured him lifelong financial security.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2007|p=122}}

Art historians consider ''The Wounded Montenegrin'' to be one of Jovanović's best Orientalist works.{{sfnm|1a1=Antić|1y=1970|1p=31|2a1=Filipovitch-Robinson|2y=2008|2p=39}} Petrović calls it the "crowning achievement" of the artist's studies under Müller.{{sfn|Petrović|2012|p=16}} Jovanović went on to paint a number of other Orientalist pieces, notably ''The Snake Charmer'' (1887).{{sfn|Popović|2014|pp=27–31}}

'''''Tractatus coislinianus''''' is an ancient Greek manuscript outlining a theory of [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] in the tradition of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.

==Dramatic theory==
The ''Tractatus'' states that comedy invokes laughter and pleasure, thus purging those emotions ([[catharsis]]), in a manner parallel to the description of [[tragedy]] in the ''Poetics''. It proceeds to describe the devices used and manner in which [[catharsis]] is brought about.

==History==
The manuscript now resides in [[Paris, France]], at the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]]; it is labeled "Coislinianus 120". The 10th-century manuscript resided at [[Great Lavra]] on [[Mount Athos]]. In 1643, [[Athanasius Rhetor]] sent it from [[Cyprus]] to [[Pierre Séguier|Séguier de Coislin]]. The classicist [[J. A. Cramer]], poring through the collection of [[Henri Charles du Cambout de Coislin]], was struck by the content, believing it to be the work of a commentator on Aristotle's theory of comedy, and published it in 1839. This belief was soon derided, but it has gained force in the 20th century; [[Richard Janko]] has argued that it is the notes or sketches of the lost second section of the ''Poetics''. Nesselrath argues that it is a later work, perhaps by [[Theophrastus]].

'''Wilhelm Uhde''' (28 October 1874, [[Strzelce Krajeńskie|Friedeberg]], [[Province of Brandenburg]] (now Poland) – 17 August 1947, [[Paris]]) was a [[Germany|German]] art collector, dealer, author and critic, an early collector of modernist painting, and a significant figure in the career of [[Henri Rousseau]].

==Biography==
[[File:Robert Delaunay, 1907, Portrait of Wilhelm Uhde..jpg|thumb|upright=.9|[[Robert Delaunay]], 1907, ''Portrait of Wilhelm Uhde''. Robert Delaunay and Sonia Terk met through Wilhelm Uhde, with whom Sonia had been married as she said for "convenience"]]
Uhde studied law in Dresden but switched to art history, studying in [[Munich]] and [[Florence]] before moving to [[Paris]] in 1904. He purchased his first Picasso in 1905, and was one of the first collectors of the [[cubism|Cubist]] paintings of [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]]. He met [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Sonia Delaunay|Sonia Terk]] and Henri Rousseau in 1907, and opened his art gallery in 1908, rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs (Paris) where he exhibited Georges Braque, [[Jean Metzinger]], Sonia Delaunay, [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Auguste Herbin]], [[Jules Pascin]] and Pablo Picasso.&lt;ref&gt;MAM, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Paris 1937, L'Art Indépendant, ex. cat. {{ISBN|2-85346-044-4}}, Paris-Musées, 1987, P. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Uhde commissioned Picasso to paint his portrait (1910) and produced the first monograph on Rousseau in 1911.&lt;ref name=dah&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistorians.info/uhdew|title=Dictionary of Art Historians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Helmut Kolle-Wilhelm Uhde-portrait.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|[[Helmut Kolle]], ca.1930, ''Portrait of Wilhelm Uhde'']]
Uhde and Sonia Terk married in 1908 (London), reportedly a marriage of convenience which masked his homosexuality. They divorced 1910 and Terk married Robert Delaunay.&lt;ref name=dah/&gt;

At the outbreak of [[World War I]], many German nationals living in France had their possessions sequestered by the French state. As a result, Uhde's collection (including works by Georges Braque, Raoul Dufy, [[Juan Gris]], Auguste Herbin, [[Marie Laurencin]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Jean Metzinger]], Pablo Picasso, [[Jean Puy]] and [[Henri Rousseau]]) was confiscated in 1914 and sold by the government in a series of auctions at the [[Hôtel Drouot]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll18/id/5199/rec/6 The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries, ''Vente de biens allemands ayant fait l'objet d'une mesure de Séquestre de Guerre'': Collection Uhde.

From 1919-1920, Uhde worked with [[Helmut Kolle]] and lived with him in Chantilly, France. Uhde became active as a [[pacifism|pacifist]] in [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]], but returned to France in 1924, moving back to [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]] in 1927. A Jew, he spent the [[World War II|Second World War]] in hiding in southern France, at one point helped by the art critic and [[French resistance|resistance]] leader [[Jean Cassou]].

==The Sacred Heart painters==
Uhde is also known as the principal organiser of the first [[Naive Art]] exhibition, which took place in Paris in 1928. The participants were [[Henri Rousseau]], [[André Bauchant]], [[Camille Bombois]], [[Séraphine Louis]] and [[Louis Vivin]], known collectively as the Sacred Heart painters. Séraphine Louis had been Uhde's housecleaner, whose work he had discovered and sponsored from 1912 to 1930.

==Legacy==
A significant part of Uhde's life story is told in the 2008 French film ''[[Séraphine (film)|Séraphine]]'' by director [[Martin Provost]], focusing on the encounter and subsequent role of [[Séraphine Louis]] in his life and he in hers. The film won seven [[César Award]]s, including [[César Award for Best Film|Best Film]].
